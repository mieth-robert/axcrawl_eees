Title: DySTAN: Joint Modeling of Sedentary Activity and Social Context from Smartphone Sensors
Authors: Aditya Sneh, Nilesh Kumar Sahu, Snehil Gupta, Haroon R. Lone
Abstract: Accurately recognizing human context from smartphone sensor data remains a significant challenge, especially in sedentary settings where activities such as studying, attending lectures, relaxing, and eating exhibit highly similar inertial patterns. Furthermore, social context plays a critical role in understanding user behavior, yet is often overlooked in mobile sensing research. To address these gaps, we introduce LogMe, a mobile sensing application that passively collects smartphone sensor data (accelerometer, gyroscope, magnetometer, and rotation vector) and prompts users for hourly self-reports capturing both sedentary activity and social context. Using this dual-label dataset, we propose DySTAN (Dynamic Cross-Stitch with Task Attention Network), a multi-task learning framework that jointly classifies both context dimensions from shared sensor inputs. It integrates task-specific layers with cross-task attention to model subtle distinctions effectively. DySTAN improves sedentary activity macro F1 scores by 21.8% over a single-task CNN-BiLSTM-GRU (CBG) model and by 8.2% over the strongest multi-task baseline, Sluice Network (SN). These results demonstrate the importance of modeling multiple, co-occurring context dimensions to improve the accuracy and robustness of mobile context recognition.

Title: Towards Sustainable Precision: Machine Learning for Laser Micromachining Optimization
Authors: Luis Correas-Naranjo, Miguel Camacho-Sánchez, Laëtitia Launet, Milena Zuric, Valery Naranjo
Abstract: In the pursuit of sustainable manufacturing, ultra-short pulse laser micromachining stands out as a promising solution while also offering high-precision and qualitative laser processing. However, unlocking the full potential of ultra-short pulse lasers requires an optimized monitoring system capable of early detection of defective workpieces, regardless of the preprocessing technique employed. While advances in machine learning can help predict process quality features, the complexity of monitoring data necessitates reducing both model size and data dimensionality to enable real-time analysis. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a machine learning framework designed to enhance surface quality assessment across diverse preprocessing techniques. To facilitate real-time laser processing monitoring, our solution aims to optimize the computational requirements of the machine learning model. Experimental results show that the proposed model not only outperforms the generalizability achieved by previous works across diverse preprocessing techniques but also significantly reduces the computational requirements for training. Through these advancements, we aim to establish the baseline for a more sustainable manufacturing process.

Title: On the Difficulty of Token-Level Modeling of Dysfluency and Fluency Shaping Artifacts
Authors: Kashaf Gulzar, Dominik Wagner, Sebastian P. Bayerl, Florian Hönig, Tobias Bocklet, Korbinian Riedhammer
Abstract: Automatic transcription of stuttered speech remains a challenge, even for modern end-to-end (E2E) automatic speech recognition (ASR) frameworks. Dysfluencies and fluency-shaping artifacts are often overlooked, resulting in non-verbatim transcriptions with limited clinical and research value. We propose a parameter-efficient adaptation method to decode dysfluencies and fluency modifications as special tokens within transcriptions, evaluated on simulated (LibriStutter, English) and natural (KSoF, German) stuttered speech datasets. To mitigate ASR performance disparities and bias towards English, we introduce a multi-step fine-tuning strategy with language-adaptive pretraining. Tokenization analysis further highlights the tokenizer's English-centric bias, which poses challenges for improving performance on German data. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness of lightweight adaptation techniques for dysfluency-aware ASR while exposing key limitations in multilingual E2E systems.

Title: Seizure-NGCLNet: Representation Learning of SEEG Spatial Pathological Patterns for Epileptic Seizure Detection via Node-Graph Dual Contrastive Learning
Authors: Yiping Wang, Peiren Wang, Zhenye Li, Fang Liu, Jinguo Huang
Abstract: Complex spatial connectivity patterns, such as interictal suppression and ictal propagation, complicate accurate drug-resistant epilepsy (DRE) seizure detection using stereotactic electroencephalography (SEEG) and traditional machine learning methods. Two critical challenges remain:(1)a low signal-to-noise ratio in functional connectivity estimates, making it difficult to learn seizure-related interactions; and (2)expert labels for spatial pathological connectivity patterns are difficult to obtain, meanwhile lacking the patterns' representation to improve seizure detection. To address these issues, we propose a novel node-graph dual contrastive learning framework, Seizure-NGCLNet, to learn SEEG interictal suppression and ictal propagation patterns for detecting DRE seizures with high precision. First, an adaptive graph augmentation strategy guided by centrality metrics is developed to generate seizure-related brain networks. Second, a dual-contrastive learning approach is integrated, combining global graph-level contrast with local node-graph contrast, to encode both spatial structural and semantic epileptogenic features. Third, the pretrained embeddings are fine-tuned via a top-k localized graph attention network to perform the final classification. Extensive experiments on a large-scale public SEEG dataset from 33 DRE patients demonstrate that Seizure-NGCLNet achieves state-of-the-art performance, with an average accuracy of 95.93%, sensitivity of 96.25%, and specificity of 94.12%. Visualizations confirm that the learned embeddings clearly separate ictal from interictal states, reflecting suppression and propagation patterns that correspond to the clinical mechanisms. These results highlight Seizure-NGCLNet's ability to learn interpretable spatial pathological patterns, enhancing both seizure detection and seizure onset zone localization.

Title: Comparing Baseline and Day-1 Diffusion MRI Using Multimodal Deep Embeddings for Stroke Outcome Prediction
Authors: Sina Raeisadigh, Myles Joshua Toledo Tan, Henning Müller, Abderrahmane Hedjoudje
Abstract: This study compares baseline (J0) and 24-hour (J1) diffusion magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for predicting three-month functional outcomes after acute ischemic stroke (AIS). Seventy-four AIS patients with paired apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) scans and clinical data were analyzed. Three-dimensional ResNet-50 embeddings were fused with structured clinical variables, reduced via principal component analysis (<=12 components), and classified using linear support vector machines with eight-fold stratified group cross-validation. J1 multimodal models achieved the highest predictive performance (AUC = 0.923 +/- 0.085), outperforming J0-based configurations (AUC <= 0.86). Incorporating lesion-volume features further improved model stability and interpretability. These findings demonstrate that early post-treatment diffusion MRI provides superior prognostic value to pre-treatment imaging and that combining MRI, clinical, and lesion-volume features produces a robust and interpretable framework for predicting three-month functional outcomes in AIS patients.

Title: TT-Stack: A Transformer-Based Tiered-Stacking Ensemble Framework with Meta-Learning for Automated Breast Cancer Detection in Mammography
Authors: Showkat Osman, Md. Tajwar Munim Turzo, Maher Ali Rusho, Md. Makid Haider, Sazzadul Islam Sajin, Ayatullah Hasnat Behesti, Ahmed Faizul Haque Dhrubo, Md. Khurshid Jahan, Mohammad Abdul Qayum
Abstract: Breast cancer continues to be the second most common cause of cancer-related deaths around the world, with early detection being important to improve survival rates for patients. Traditional computer-aided diagnosis systems have limitations in their ability to represent features and generalize to the range of mammographic images. We present a new two-level Stack of Transformers (TT-Stack) ensemble framework based on using heterogeneous lightweight vision transformer architectures to automatically identify breast cancer in mammograms. Specifically, we integrate seven state-of-the-art vision transformers: RepViT, DaViT, EfficientViT, MobileViT, FasterViT, MViT, and PVT v2 while also designing a two-tier meta-learning approach for the ensemble by simply taking the logits from the base model and applying logistic regression for binary classification (Cancer vs. Non-Cancer). Each of the transformer backbone models was developed to process single-channel grayscale mammograms while still taking advantage of transfer learning from pre-training on ImageNet so that they would offer a parameter-efficient approach that may reasonably be applied in clinical practice with minimal variance. The training process included stratified 80/20 splits when necessary, class-balanced upsampling, early stopping, and an adaptive learning rate schedule on the public Mammogram Mastery dataset. In separate evaluations here, it was determined that EfficientViT and PVT-v2 were the top per-forming models achieving 99.33% validation, 97.96% F1-score, and perfect 1.000:0 ROC-AUC with only small train/validation gaps. Finally, the TT-Stack ensemble model by the end of the evaluation reached 99.33% accuracy with 100% precision, 96% recall, 97.96% F1-score and a 99.97% ROC-AUC, and demonstrated robustness in performance due to the diversity of the architecture.

Title: Scalable Distributed Nonlinear Control Under Flatness-Preserving Coupling
Authors: Fengjun Yang, Jake Welde, Nikolai Matni
Abstract: We study distributed control for a network of nonlinear, differentially flat subsystems subject to dynamic coupling. Although differential flatness simplifies planning and control for isolated subsystems, the presence of coupling can destroy this property for the overall joint system. Focusing on subsystems in pure-feedback form, we identify a class of compatible lower-triangular dynamic couplings that preserve flatness and guarantee that the flat outputs of the subsystems remain the flat outputs of the coupled system. Further, we show that the joint flatness diffeomorphism can be constructed from those of the individual subsystems and, crucially, its sparsity structure reflects that of the coupling. Exploiting this structure, we synthesize a distributed tracking controller that computes control actions from local information only, thereby ensuring scalability. We validate our proposed framework on a simulated example of planar quadrotors dynamically coupled via aerodynamic downwash, and show that the distributed controller achieves accurate trajectory tracking.

Title: Hardware Distortion Aware Precoding for ISAC Systems
Authors: Murat Babek Salman, Emil Björnson, Özlem Tugfe Demir
Abstract: The impact of hardware impairments on the spectral efficiency of communication systems is well studied, but their effect on sensing performance remains unexplored. In this paper, we analyze the influence of hardware impairments on integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in cluttered environments. We derive the sensing signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) and show that hardware distortions significantly degrade sensing performance by enhancing clutter-induced noise, which masks target echoes. The isotropic nature of transmit distortion due to multiple stream transmission further complicates clutter suppression. To address this, we propose a distortion- and clutter-aware precoding strategy that minimizes the deviation from the communication-optimized precoder while improving sensing robustness. We also propose an alternative power allocation-based approach that reduces computational complexity. Numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approaches in overcoming hardware- and clutter-induced limitations, demonstrating significant performance gains over distortion-unaware designs.

Title: Wavenumber-Division Multiplexing in Holographic MIMO with NLoS Channels
Authors: Ashutosh Prajapati, Prathapasinghe Dharmawansa, Marco Di Renzo, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Wavenumber-division multiplexing (WDM) was introduced as a counterpart of orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing in the spatial-frequency domain for line-of-sight holographic multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. In this paper, we extend WDM to holographic MIMO channels with non-line-of-sight (NLoS) propagation. We show that applying WDM to the NLoS channel yields the corresponding angular-domain representation, which we characterize through the power spectral factor and power spectral density. We further obtain a closed-form characterization for the case of isotropic scattering, recovering Jakes' isotropic model. The analysis is complemented by numerical results evaluating the degrees of freedom and ergodic capacity under both isotropic and non-isotropic scattering.

Title: Verifying Closed-Loop Contractivity of Learning-Based Controllers via Partitioning
Authors: Alexander Davydov
Abstract: We address the problem of verifying closed-loop contraction in nonlinear control systems whose controller and contraction metric are both parameterized by neural networks. By leveraging interval analysis and interval bound propagation, we derive a tractable and scalable sufficient condition for closed-loop contractivity that reduces to checking that the dominant eigenvalue of a symmetric Metzler matrix is nonpositive. We combine this sufficient condition with a domain partitioning strategy to integrate this sufficient condition into training. The proposed approach is validated on an inverted pendulum system, demonstrating the ability to learn neural network controllers and contraction metrics that provably satisfy the contraction condition.

Title: Edge-Native, Behavior-Adaptive Drone System for Wildlife Monitoring
Authors: Jenna Kline, Rugved Katole, Tanya Berger-Wolf, Christopher Stewart
Abstract: Wildlife monitoring with drones must balance competing demands: approaching close enough to capture behaviorally-relevant video while avoiding stress responses that compromise animal welfare and data validity. Human operators face a fundamental attentional bottleneck: they cannot simultaneously control drone operations and monitor vigilance states across entire animal groups. By the time elevated vigilance becomes obvious, an adverse flee response by the animals may be unavoidable. To solve this challenge, we present an edge-native, behavior-adaptive drone system for wildlife monitoring. This configurable decision-support system augments operator expertise with automated group-level vigilance monitoring. Our system continuously tracks individual behaviors using YOLOv11m detection and YOLO-Behavior classification, aggregates vigilance states into a real-time group stress metric, and provides graduated alerts (alert vigilance to flee response) with operator-tunable thresholds for context-specific calibration. We derive service-level objectives (SLOs) from video frame rates and behavioral dynamics: to monitor 30fps video streams in real-time, our system must complete detection and classification within 33ms per frame. Our edge-native pipeline achieves 23.8ms total inference on GPU-accelerated hardware, meeting this constraint with a substantial margin. Retrospective analysis of seven wildlife monitoring missions demonstrates detection capability and quantifies the cost of reactive control: manual piloting results in 14 seconds average adverse behavior duration with 71.9% usable frames. Our analysis reveals operators could have received actionable alerts 51s before animals fled in 57% of missions. Simulating 5-second operator intervention yields a projected performance of 82.8% usable frames with 1-second adverse behavior duration,a 93% reduction compared to manual piloting.

Title: On Frequency-Weighted Extended Balanced Truncation
Authors: Sribalaji C. Anand, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of frequency-weighted extended balanced truncation for discrete and continuous-time linear time-invariant plants. We show that the frequency-weighted discrete-time plant admits block-diagonal solutions to both the Lyapunov inequality and its extended form. A recursive algorithm for extended balanced truncation is proposed, together with corresponding a-priori error bounds. Theoretical results are extended to continuous-time systems and validated through numerical examples.

Title: On the Convergence of Density-Based Predictive Control for Multi-Agent Non-Uniform Area Coverage
Authors: Sungjun Seo, Kooktae Lee
Abstract: This paper presents Density-based Predictive Control (DPC), a novel multi-agent control strategy for efficient non-uniform area coverage, grounded in optimal transport theory. In large-scale scenarios such as search and rescue or environmental monitoring, traditional uniform coverage fails to account for varying regional priorities. DPC leverages a pre-constructed reference distribution to allocate agents' coverage efforts, spending more time in high-priority or densely sampled regions. We analyze convergence conditions using the Wasserstein distance, derive an analytic optimal control law for unconstrained cases, and propose a numerical method for constrained scenarios. Simulations on first-order dynamics and linearized quadrotor models demonstrate that DPC achieves trajectories closely matching the non-uniform reference distribution, outperforming existing coverage methods.

Title: Fleet Size and Mix Capacitated Vehicle Routing Problem with Time Windows for Mobile Fast Chargers
Authors: Farhang Motallebi Araghi, Armin Abdolmohammdi, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari
Abstract: The electrification of off-road heavy equipment presents operational challenges for agencies serving remote sites with limited fixed charging infrastructure. Existing mobile fast charging vehicle (MFCV) planning approaches typically treat fleet design and routing as separate problems, fixing vehicle characteristics before dispatch. This paper formulates a fleet size and mix capacitated vehicle routing problem with time windows (FSMCVRPTW) for MFCV deployment, jointly optimizing fleet composition, charger specifications, routing, and scheduling within a unified mixed-integer linear program. The model incorporates heterogeneous MFCV types with varying power ratings, battery capacities, fuel range, and cost structures, minimizing total daily cost from labor, fuel, amortized capital expenditure, and energy purchase under temporal service windows, resource budgets, and energy-delivery constraints. The formulation is implemented in Python/Gurobi and applied to two case studies using California Department of Transportation wheel-loader data in Los Angeles (dense urban) and Truckee (sparse mountainous). Results show that simultaneous optimization yields compact, well-utilized fleets that meet all service windows while revealing strong sensitivity of unit cost to demand density and geography. The proposed FSMCVRPTW framework provides a generalizable decision-support methodology that co-designs fleet size, charger power, routing, and service schedules in a single optimization layer for context-aware, cost-efficient mobile fast charging.

Title: Necessary and Sufficient Conditions for PID Design of MIMO Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Tianyou Xiang, Cheng Zhao
Abstract: As is well known, classical PID control is ubiquitous in industrial processes, yet a rigorous and explicit design theory for nonlinear uncertain MIMO second-order systems remains underdeveloped. In this paper we consider a class of such systems with both uncertain dynamics and an unknown but strictly positive input gain, where the nonlinear uncertainty is characterized by bounds on the Jacobian with respect to the state variables. We explicitly construct a three-dimensional region for the PID gains that is sufficient to guarantee global stability and asymptotic tracking of constant references for all nonlinearities satisfying these Jacobian bounds. We then derive a corresponding necessary region, thereby revealing the inherent conservatism required to cope with worst-case uncertainties. Moreover, under additional structural assumptions on the nonlinearities, these sufficient and necessary regions coincide, yielding a precise necessary-and-sufficient characterization of all globally stabilizing PID gains. All these regions are given in closed form and depend only on the prescribed Jacobian bounds and the known lower bound of the input gain, in contrast to many qualitative tuning methods in the literature.

Title: Bayesian Probability Fusion for Multi-AP Collaborative Sensing in Mobile Networks
Authors: Shengheng Liu, Xingkang Li, Yongming Huang, Yuan Fang, Qingji Jiang, Dazhuan Xu, Ziguo Zhong, Dongming Wang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication is widely acknowledged as a foundational technology for next-generation mobile networks. Compared with monostatic sensing, multi-access point (AP) collaborative sensing endows mobile networks with broader, more accurate, and resilient sensing capabilities, which are critical for diverse location-based sectors. This paper focuses on collaborative sensing in multi-AP networks and proposes a Bayesian probability fusion framework for target parameter estimation using orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing waveform. The framework models multi-AP received signals as probability distributions to capture stochastic observations from channel noise and scattering coefficients. Prior information is then incorporated into the joint probability density function to cast the problem as a constrained maximum a posteriori estimation. To address the high-dimensional optimization, we develop a prior-constrained gradient ascent (PCGA) algorithm that decouples correlated parameters and performs efficient gradient updates guided by the target prior. Theoretical analysis covers optimal fusion weights for global signal-to-noise ratio maximization, PCGA convergence, and the Cramer-Rao lower bound of the estimator, with insights applicable to broader fusion schemes. Extensive numerical simulations and real-world experiments with commercial devices show the framework reduces transmission overhead by 90% versus signal fusion and lowers estimation error by 41% relative to parameter fusion. Notably, field tests achieve submeter accuracy with 50% probability in typical coverage of mmWave APs. These improvements highlight a favorable balance between communication efficiency and estimation accuracy for practical multi-AP sensing deployment. The dataset is released for research purposes and is publicly available at: this http URL

Title: Channel Knowledge Map Enabled Low-Altitude ISAC Networks: Joint Air Corridor Planning and Base Station Deployment
Authors: Jiaxuan Li, Yilong Chen, Fan Liu, Jie Xu
Abstract: This letter addresses the joint air corridor planning and base station (BS) deployment problem for low-altitude integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks. In the considered system, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) operate within a structured air corridor composed of connected cubic segments, and multiple BSs need to be selectively deployed at a set of candidate locations to ensure both sensing and communication coverage throughout the corridor. In particular, we leverage the channel knowledge map (CKM) to characterize wireless channels for candidate BS sites prior to deployment, thereby facilitating the offline planning. Under this setup, we minimize the system cost in terms of the weighted sum of the air corridor length and the number of deployed BSs, subject to the constraints on both sensing and communication performance across the corridor. To solve the formulated large-scale nonconvex integer programming problem, we develop a hierarchical coarse-to-fine grid decomposition algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate the benefit of the proposed joint design in reducing the overall deployment cost while ensuring the coverage of the low-altitude ISAC networks.

Title: Cell-free versus Conventional Massive MIMO : An Analysis of Channel Capacity based on Channel Measurement in the FR3 Band
Authors: Qi Zhen, Pan Tang, Haiyang Miao, Enrui Liu, Ximan Liu, Zihang Ding, Jianhua Zhang
Abstract: Cell-free massive MIMO (CF-mMIMO) has emerged as a promising technology for next generation wireless systems, combining the benefits of distributed antenna systems (DAS) and traditional MIMO technology. In this work, we present the first extensive channel measurements for CF-mMIMO in the mid-band (FR3, 6-24 GHz), using a virtual widely distributed antenna array comprising 512 elements in the urban Macrocell (UMa) environment. Based on the measurement data, this paper compares the channel capacity of CF-mMIMO and Conventional mMIMO under both line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions across a range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs). We then analyze how channel capacity varies with Rx positions from the perspectives of the full array and of individual subarrays. Finally, we conclude that the 64-element array configuration yields the greatest advantage in channel capacity for CF-mMIMO in the measurement environment considered, with gains of 14.02\% under LOS and 24.61\% under NLOS conditions. This in-depth analysis of channel capacity in the FR3 band provides critical insights for optimizing CF-mMIMO systems in next generation wireless networks.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Joint Uplink-Downlink CSI Acquisition for Next-Generation Upper Mid-Band Systems
Authors: Xuan He, Hongwei Hou, Yafei Wang, Wenjin Wang, Shi Jin, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Ottersten
Abstract: In next-generation wireless communication systems, the newly designated upper mid-band has attracted considerable attention, also called frequency range 3 (FR3), highlighting the need for downlink (DL) transmission design, which fundamentally relies on accurate CSI. However, CSI acquisition in FR3 systems faces significant challenges: the increased number of antennas and wider transmission bandwidth introduces prohibitive training overhead with traditional estimation approaches, as each probing captures only incomplete spatial-frequency observation, while higher carrier frequencies lead to faster temporal channel variation. To address these challenges, we propose a novel CSI acquisition framework that integrates CSI feedback, uplink (UL) and DL channel estimation, as well as channel prediction in the FR3 TDD massive MIMO systems. Specifically, we first develop the Joint UL and DL Channel Estimation Network (JUDCEN) to fuse incomplete observations based on the SRSs and CSI-RSs. By exploiting the complementary characteristics of preliminary UL and DL estimation features, obtained through initial UL estimation and quantized-feedback-assisted DL estimation, it enables full CSI reconstruction in the spatial domain. To mitigate the performance degradation in the feedback process, we propose the Transformer-MLP CSI Feedback Network (TMCFN), employing an MLP-based module to jointly exploit angle- and delay-domain features. Building upon the reconstructed full CSI, we further develop the Mamba-based Channel Prediction Network (MCPN), which exploits selective state-space model (SSM) mechanism to capture long-range temporal dynamics in the angle-delay domain for future CSI prediction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework consistently outperforms benchmarks in both CSI acquisition accuracy and transmission spectral efficiency with lower computational complexity.

Title: Intervention Strategies for Fairness and Efficiency at Autonomous Single-Intersection Traffic Flows
Authors: Salman Ghori, Ania Adil, Melkior Ornik, Eric Feron
Abstract: Intersections present significant challenges in traffic management, where ensuring safety and efficiency is essential for effective flow. However, these goals are often achieved at the expense of fairness, which is critical for trustworthiness and long-term sustainability. This paper investigates how the timing of centralized intervention affects the management of autonomous agents at a signal-less, orthogonal intersection, while satisfying safety constraints, evaluating efficiency, and ensuring fairness. A mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) approach is used to optimize agent coordination within a circular control zone centered at the intersection. We introduce the concept of fairness, measured via pairwise reversal counts, and incorporate fairness constraints into the MILP framework. We then study the relationship between fairness and system efficiency and its impact on platoon formation. Finally, simulation studies analyze the effectiveness of early versus late intervention strategies and fairness-aware control, focusing on safe, efficient, and robust management of agents within the control zone.

Title: Predictive Beamforming in Low-Altitude Wireless Networks: A Cross-Attention Approach
Authors: Xiaotong Zhao, Yuanhao Cui, Weijie Yuan, Ziye Jia, Heng Liu, Chengwen Xing
Abstract: Accurate beam prediction is essential for maintaining reliable links and high spectral efficiency in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks. However, existing approaches often fail to capture the deep correlations across heterogeneous sensing modalities, limiting their adaptability in complex three-dimensional environments. To overcome these challenges, we propose a multi-modal predictive beamforming method based on a cross-attention fusion mechanism that jointly leverages visual and structured sensor data. The proposed model utilizes a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn multi-scale spatial feature hierarchies from visual images and a Transformer encoder to capture cross-dimensional dependencies within sensor data. Then, a cross-attention fusion module is introduced to integrate complementary information between the two modalities, generating a unified and discriminative representation for accurate beam prediction. Through experimental evaluations conducted on a real-world dataset, our method reaches 79.7% Top-1 accuracy and 99.3% Top-3 accuracy, surpassing the 3D ResNet-Transformer baseline by 4.4%-23.2% across Top-1 to Top-5 metrics. These results verify that multi-modal cross-attention fusion is effective for intelligent beam selection in dynamic low-altitude wireless networks.

Title: Zero-Forcing MU-MIMO Precoding under Power Amplifier Non-Linearities
Authors: Juan Vidal Alegría, Ashkan Sheikhi, Ove Edfors
Abstract: In multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems, the non-linear behavior of the power amplifiers (PAs) may cause degradation of the linear precoding schemes dealing with interference between user equipments (UEs), e.g., the zero-forcing (ZF) precoder. One way to minimize this effect is to use digital-pre-distortion (DPD) modules to linearize the PAs. However, using perfect DPD modules is costly and it may incur significant power consumption. As an alternative, we consider the problem of characterizing non-linearity-aware ZF (NLA-ZF) precoding schemes, hereby defined as linear precoders that achieve perfect interference cancellation in the presence of PA non-linearity by exploiting knowledge of this non-linear response. We provide initial iterative solutions that allow achieving NLA-ZF (up to adjustable tolerance) in a two-UE downlink MU-MIMO scenario where the base station (BS) has an even number of antennas, and each antenna is connected to a PA exhibiting third-order memory-less non-linear behavior. The proposed approach allows for performance gains in scenarios with significant residual interference.

Title: Reduced-order Smith predictor for state feedback control with guaranteed stability
Authors: Jesus-Pablo Toledo-Zucco, Frédéric Gouaisbaut, Gaetan Chapput
Abstract: This article deals with the implementation of the Smith Predictor for state feedback control in state space representation. The desired control law, obtained using partial differential equations and backstepping control, contains an integral term that has to be approximated for implementation. In this article, we propose a new way to implement this control law using a dynamic controller. The control law is composed of a state feedback term and a dynamic term that approaches the integral term that has to be estimated for implementation. Using a Lyapunov functional, we provide sufficient conditions, in terms of a linear matrix inequality, to guarantee that the closed-loop system is stable when the proposed control law is applied. We use three examples, taken from the literature, to show the benefits of the proposed approach.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Matching for Ultra-Dense Massive Antenna Arrays
Authors: Carolina Nolasco-Ferencikova, Georg Schwan, Raphael Rolny, Alexander Stutz-Tirri, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) offers substantial spectral-efficiency gains, but scaling to very large antenna arrays with conventional all-digital and hybrid beamforming architectures quickly results in excessively high costs and power consumption. Low-cost, switch-based architectures have recently emerged as a potential alternative. However, prior studies rely on simplified models that ignore (among others) antenna coupling, radiation patterns, and matching losses, resulting in inaccurate performance predictions. In this paper, we use a physically consistent electromagnetic modeling framework to analyze an ultra-dense patch-antenna array architecture that performs joint beamforming and matching using networks of inexpensive RF switches. Our results demonstrate that simple, switch-based beamforming architectures can approach the antenna-gain of all-digital solutions at significantly lower cost and complexity.

Title: Modal Analysis of Core Inertial Dynamics: Re-evaluating Grid-Forming Control Design Principles
Authors: Gerardo Medrano, Santiago Cóbreces
Abstract: This paper employs modal analysis to study the core inertial dynamics of governor-controlled synchronous generators (GC-SG), droop-based grid-forming (GFM) converters, and their most fundamental interactions. The results indicate that even in the simplest cases, the prevailing industry paradigm of emulating legacy GC-SG behaviour in GFM converters (high inertia to slow down the system and large droop to increase damping) could be a suboptimal policy. It is shown that GC-SGs exhibit a fundamental trade-off: adequate damping of the turbine-governor mode requires large droop constants, inevitably increasing steady-state frequency deviation and dependence on secondary regulation. In contrast, droop-based GFM converters invert this relationship: decreasing the droop constant simultaneously reduces steady-state frequency deviations and increases damping, while allowing virtual inertia to be freely chosen. When two GC-SGs are coupled, the poorly damped electromechanical swing mode emerges. Results show that replacing one GC-SG with a GFM converter of equivalent droop and inertia already significantly improves damping of both swing and turbine-governor modes. Counter-intuitively, further and remarkable damping gains are achieved by substantially lowering the GFM virtual inertia constant. These findings suggest that current industry trends may be constraining the potential benefits of Inverter Based Resources (IBRs). Optimal stability and performance are instead obtained with low droop and low virtual inertia, yielding tightly bounded frequency variations and strongly-damped electromechanical modes. The results indicate a need to re-evaluate GFM control design principles and emerging grid-code requirements.

Title: G-PIFNN: A Generalizable Physics-informed Fourier Neural Network Framework for Electrical Circuits
Authors: Ibrahim Shahbaz, Mohammad J. Abdel-Rahman, Eman Hammad
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have advanced the data-driven solution of differential equations (DEs) in dynamic physical systems, yet challenges remain in explainability, scalability, and architectural complexity. This paper presents a Generalizable Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (G-PIFNN) framework that enhances PINN architectures for efficient and interpretable electrical circuit analysis. The proposed G-PIFNN introduces three key advancements: (1) improved performance and interpretability via a physics activation function (PAF) and a lightweight Physics-Informed Fourier Neural Network (PIFNN) architecture; (2) automated, bond graph (BG) based formulation of physics-informed loss functions for systematic differential equation generation; and (3) integration of intra-circuit and cross-circuit class transfer learning (TL) strategies, enabling unsupervised fine-tuning for rapid adaptation to varying circuit topologies. Numerical simulations demonstrate that G-PIFNN achieves significantly better predictive performance and generalization across diverse circuit classes, while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters compared to standard PINNs.

Title: Channel Knowledge Map Construction via Physics-Inspired Diffusion Model Without Prior Observations
Authors: Yunzhe Zhu, Xuewen Liao, Zhenzhen Gao, Yong Zeng
Abstract: The ability to construct Channel Knowledge Map (CKM) with high precision is essential for environment awareness in 6G wireless systems. However, most existing CKM construction methods formulate the task as an image super-resolution or generation problem, thereby employing models originally developed for computer vision. As a result, the generated CKMs often fail to capture the underlying physical characteristics of wireless propagation. In this paper, we focus on the construction of CKM for large-scale fading scenarios and design three physics-based constraint terms to characterize the spatial distribution patterns of large-scale fading. By integrating these physical constraints with a state-of-the-art diffusion model that possesses superior generative capability, a physics-inspired diffusion model for CKM construction is proposed. Following this motivation, we derive the loss function of the diffusion model augmented with physics-based constraint terms and further design the training and generation framework for the proposed physics-inspired CKM generation diffusion model. Extensive experiments show that our approach outperforms all existing methods in terms of construction accuracy. Moreover, the proposed model provides a unified and effective framework with strong potential for generating diverse, accurate, and physically consistent CKM.

Title: Towards Language-Independent Face-Voice Association with Multimodal Foundation Models
Authors: Aref Farhadipour, Teodora Vukovic, Volker Dellwo
Abstract: This paper describes the UZH-CL system submitted to the FAME2026 Challenge. The challenge focuses on cross-modal verification under unique multilingual conditions, specifically unseen and unheard languages. Our approach investigates two distinct architectures, consisting of a baseline dual-encoder system trained from scratch using contrastive and orthogonal projection losses, and a foundation model approach leveraging ImageBind with LoRA. To address the data scarcity and language constraints of the challenge, we curated an external Arabic dataset from VoxBlink. Our best-performing system, ImageBind-LoRA, demonstrates remarkable cross-lingual generalization: despite being fine-tuned exclusively on Arabic audio, it achieved an EER of 24.73% on the evaluation set (English and German), securing 2nd place in the competition.

Title: Effects of disease duration and antipsychotics on brain age in schizophrenia
Authors: Alejandro Roig-Herrero, Luis M. San-José-Revuelta, Rafael Navarro-González, Rodrigo de Luis-García, Vicente Molina
Abstract: Accelerated brain aging has been consistently reported in patients with schizophrenia. Over the past decade, these findings have been replicated using the Brain Age paradigm, which applies machine learning techniques to estimate brain age from neuroimaging data. This approach yields a single index, the Brain Age Gap, defined as the difference between predicted and chronological age. Nevertheless, both the progressive nature of this phenomenon and the potential role of antipsychotic medication remain unclear. To investigate its progression, we compared the Brain Age Gap between individuals experiencing a first episode of psychosis and healthy controls using ANCOVA, adjusting for age, sex, body mass index, and estimated total intracranial volume. To enhance the robustness of our findings, we employed two distinct models: a transformer-inspired model based on harmonized volumetric brain features extracted with FastSurfer, and a previously trained deep learning model. To assess the potential effect of medication, we further compared bipolar patients who received antipsychotic treatment with those who did not. Mann-Whitney U test consistently showed that medicated bipolar patients did not exhibit a significantly larger Brain Age Gap. Both models converge on the conclusion that accelerated brain aging is unlikely to be explained by antipsychotic medication alone. Longitudinal studies are therefore required to clarify the temporal dynamics of brain aging in schizophrenia.

Title: Diffusion-Prior Split Gibbs Sampling for Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging under Incomplete Measurements
Authors: Hefei Gao, Tianyao Huang, Letian Guo, Jie He, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) imaging plays a critical role in all-weather, day-and-night remote sensing, yet reconstruction is often challenged by noise, undersampling, and complex scattering scenarios. Conventional methods, including matched filtering and sparsity-based compressed sensing, are limited in capturing intricate scene structures and frequently suffer from artifacts, elevated sidelobes, and loss of fine details. Recent diffusion models have demonstrated superior capability in representing high-order priors; however, existing diffusion-based SAR methods still yield degraded reconstructions due to oversimplified likelihood approximations in guided sampling. In this work, we propose a diffusion-driven split Gibbs sampling framework for SAR reconstruction, rigorously integrating measurement fidelity with learned diffusion priors. By alternately performing likelihood- and prior-driven updates via proximal sampling, this method ensures progressive convergence toward the true posterior while fully leveraging the expressive power of diffusion priors. Extensive experiments on simulated and Sentinel-1A datasets demonstrate substantial performance improvements: over 7 dB average PSNR gain in simulations, along with significant sidelobe suppression (MPLSR +2.96 dB, MISLR +11.5 dB) with respect to the best baseline result. On real-world Sentinel-1A data, the method achieves an average PSNR gain of 1.6 dB while effectively reducing artifacts and preserving scene details, including ridges, edges, and fine textures. These results underscore the potential of the adapted framework as a robust and generalizable solution for high-fidelity SAR imaging across diverse sensing scenarios.

Title: Gain-Scheduling Data-Enabled Predictive Control for Nonlinear Systems with Linearized Operating Regions
Authors: Sebastian Zieglmeier, Mathias Hudoba de Badyn, Narada D. Warakagoda, Thomas R. Krogstad, Paal Engelstad
Abstract: This paper presents a Gain-Scheduled Data-Enabled Predictive Control (GS-DeePC) framework for nonlinear systems based on multiple locally linear data representations. Instead of relying on a single global Hankel matrix, the operating range of a measurable scheduling variable is partitioned into regions, and regional Hankel matrices are constructed from persistently exciting data. To ensure smooth transitions between linearization regions and suppress region-induced chattering, composite regions are introduced, merging neighboring data sets and enabling a robust switching mechanism. The proposed method maintains the original DeePC problem structure and can achieve reduced computational complexity by requiring only short, locally informative data sequences. Extensive experiments on a nonlinear DC-motor with an unbalanced disc demonstrate the significantly improved control performance compared to standard DeePC.

Title: System Identification for Dynamic Modeling of a Bumper Car
Authors: Tobias Petri, Simone Baratto, Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate
Abstract: This paper presents the modeling of autonomous vehicles with high maneuverability used in an experimental framework for educational purposes. Since standard bicycle models typically neglect wide steering angles, we develop modified planar bicycle models and combine them with both parametric and non-parametric identification techniques that progressively incorporate physical knowledge. The resulting models are systematically compared to evaluate the tradeoff between model accuracy and computational requirements, showing that physics-informed neural network models surpass the purely physical baseline in accuracy at lower computational cost.

Title: Tempering the Bayes Filter towards Improved Model-Based Estimation
Authors: Menno van Zutphen, Domagoj Herceg, Giannis Delimpaltadakis, Duarte J. Antunes
Abstract: Model-based filtering is often carried out while subject to an imperfect model, as learning partially-observable stochastic systems remains a challenge. Recent work on Bayesian inference found that tempering the likelihood or full posterior of an imperfect model can improve predictive accuracy, as measured by expected negative log likelihood. In this paper, we develop the tempered Bayes filter, improving estimation performance through both of the aforementioned, and one newly introduced, modalities. The result admits a recursive implementation with a computational complexity no higher than that of the original Bayes filter. Our analysis reveals that -- besides the well-known fact in the field of Bayesian inference that likelihood tempering affects the balance between prior and likelihood -- full-posterior tempering tunes the level of entropy in the final belief distribution. We further find that a region of the tempering space can be understood as interpolating between the Bayes- and MAP filters, recovering these as special cases. Analytical results further establish conditions under which a tempered Bayes filter achieves improved predictive performance. Specializing the results to the linear Gaussian case, we obtain the tempered Kalman filter. In this context, we interpret how the parameters affect the Kalman state estimate and covariance propagation. Empirical results confirm that our method consistently improves predictive accuracy over the Bayes filter baseline.

Title: PAC-Bayesian Optimal Control with Stability and Generalization Guarantees
Authors: Mahrokh Ghoddousi Boroujeni, Clara Lucía Galimberti, Andreas Krause, Giancarlo Ferrari-Trecate
Abstract: Stochastic Nonlinear Optimal Control (SNOC) seeks to minimize a cost function that accounts for random disturbances acting on a nonlinear dynamical system. Since the expectation over all disturbances is generally intractable, a common surrogate is the empirical cost, obtained by averaging over a finite dataset of sampled noise realizations. This substitution, however, introduces the challenge of guaranteeing performance under unseen disturbances. The issue is particularly severe when the dataset is limited, as the trained controllers may overfit, leading to substantial gaps between their empirical cost and the deployment cost. In this work, we develop a PAC-Bayesian framework that establishes rigorous generalization bounds for SNOC. Building on these bounds, we propose a principled controller design method that balances empirical performance and prior knowledge. To ensure tractability, we derive computationally efficient relaxations of the bounds and employ approximate inference methods. Our framework further leverages expressive neural controller parameterizations, guaranteeing closed-loop stability. Through simulated examples, we highlight how prior knowledge can be incorporated into control design and how more reliable controllers can be synthesized for cooperative robotics.

Authors: Dongyeong Lee, Eros Avdiaj, Jef Beerten
Abstract: This letter proposes an AC/DC frequency-dependent power flow Jacobian analysis to identify the system support capabilities. In addition, the analyses reveal that system support capabilities do not necessarily enhance the system stability margin, suggesting that technical requirements of narrow-frequency-band and AC-side focused specifications may not lead to the expected performance of GFM.

Title: Perceptual evaluation of Acoustic Level of Detail in Virtual Acoustic Environments
Authors: Stefan Fichna, Steven van de Par, Bernhard U. Seeber, Stephan D. Ewert
Abstract: Virtual acoustic environments enable the creation and simulation of realistic and eco-logically valid daily-life situations vital for hearing research and audiology. Reverberant indoor environments are particularly important. For real-time applications, room acous-tics simulation requires simplifications, however, the necessary acoustic level of detail (ALOD) remains unclear in order to capture all perceptually relevant effects. This study examines the impact of varying ALOD in simulations of three real environments: a living room with a coupled kitchen, a pub, and an underground station. ALOD was varied by generating different numbers of image sources for early reflections, or by excluding geo-metrical room details specific for each environment. Simulations were perceptually eval-uated using headphones in comparison to binaural room impulse responses measured with a dummy head in the corresponding real environments, or by using loudspeakers. The study assessed the perceived overall difference for a pulse stimulus, a played electric bass and a speech token. Additionally, plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externaliza-tion were evaluated. Results indicate that a strong reduction in ALOD is feasible while maintaining similar plausibility, speech intelligibility, and externalization as with dummy head recordings. The number and accuracy of early reflections appear less relevant, pro-vided diffuse late reverberation is appropriately represented.

Title: Statistical-Symbolic Verification of Perception-Based Autonomous Systems using State-Dependent Conformal Prediction
Authors: Yuang Geng, Thomas Waite, Trevor Turnquist, Radoslav Ivanov, Ivan Ruchkin
Abstract: Reachability analysis has been a prominent way to provide safety guarantees for neurally controlled autonomous systems, but its direct application to neural perception components is infeasible due to imperfect or intractable perception models. Typically, this issue has been bypassed by complementing reachability with statistical analysis of perception error, say with conformal prediction (CP). However, existing CP methods for time-series data often provide conservative bounds. The corresponding error accumulation over time has made it challenging to combine statistical bounds with symbolic reachability in a way that is provable, scalable, and minimally conservative. To reduce conservatism and improve scalability, our key insight is that perception error varies significantly with the system's dynamical state. This article proposes state-dependent conformal prediction, which exploits that dependency in constructing tight high-confidence bounds on perception error. Based on this idea, we provide an approach to partition the state space, using a genetic algorithm, so as to optimize the tightness of conformal bounds. Finally, since using these bounds in reachability analysis leads to additional uncertainty and branching in the resulting hybrid system, we propose a branch-merging reachability algorithm that trades off uncertainty for scalability so as to enable scalable and tight verification. The evaluation of our verification methodology on two complementary case studies demonstrates reduced conservatism compared to the state of the art.

Title: Maintaining SUV Accuracy in Low-Count PET with PETfectior: A Deep Learning Denoising Solution
Authors: Yamila Rotstein Habarnau, Nicolás Bustos, Paola Corona, Christian González, Sonia Traverso, Federico Matorra, Francisco Funes, Juan Martín Giraut, Laura Pelegrina, Gabriel Bruno, Mauro Namías
Abstract: Background: Diagnostic PET image quality depends on the administered activity and acquisition time. However, minimizing these variables is desirable to reduce patient radiation exposure and radiopharmaceutical costs. PETfectior is an artificial intelligence-based software that processes PET scans and increases signal-to-noise ratio, obtaining high-quality images from low-count-rate images. We perform an initial clinical validation of PETfectior on images acquired with half of the counting statistics required to meet the most recent EANM quantitative standards for 18F-FDG PET, evaluating lesions detectability, quantitative performance and image quality. Materials and methods: 258 patients referred for 18F-FDG PET/CT were prospectively included. The standard-of-care scans (100% scans) were acquired and reconstructed according to EARL standards 2. Half-counting-statistics versions were generated from list-mode data and processed with PETfecftior (50%+PETfectior scans). All oncologic lesions were segmented on both PET/CT versions, manually or automatically, and lesions detectability was evaluated. The SUVmax of the lesions was measured and the quantitative concordance of 50%+PETfectior and 100% images was evaluated. Subjective image quality was visually assessed by two experienced physicians. Results: 1649 lesions were detected in a total of 198 studies. The 50%+PETfectior images showed high sensitivity for lesion detection (99.9%) and only 1 false positive was detected. The SUVmax measured in 100% and 50%+PETfectior images agreed within 12.5% (95% limits of agreement), with a bias of -1.01%. Image quality of the 50%+PETfectior images was rated equal to or better than the standard-of-care images. Conclusion: PETfectior can safely be used in clinical practice at half counting statistics, with high sensitivity and specificity, low quantitative bias and high subjective image quality.

Title: GNSS Array-Based Multipath Detection Employing UKF on Manifolds
Authors: Abdelgabar Ahmed, Tarig Ballal, Xing Liu, Mohanad Ahmed, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) applications are often hindered by various sources of error, with multipath interference being one of the most challenging, particularly in urban environments. In this work, we build on previous research by implementing a GNSS array-based multipath detection algorithm, incorporating real-time attitude estimation for dynamic scenarios. The method fuses GNSS and IMU data using an Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF) on a manifold, enabling continuous attitude tracking. The proposed approach utilizes attitude information from satellite combinations to identify and exclude multipath-affected satellites, improving the accuracy of both positioning and attitude determination. To address computational challenges associated with evaluating large numbers of satellite combinations, we propose the use of the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC) algorithm, which reduces the number of combinations assessed while maintaining high detection performance. Performance evaluations are conducted using trajectories and IMU readings from the KITTI dataset. GNSS observations are simulated based on ground truth positions and satellite ephemeris. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting satellites affected by multipath interference. Significant improvements in positioning accuracy are observed, particularly in scenarios where a large portion of the visible satellites are contaminated by severe multipath.

Title: Learning Physically Consistent Lagrangian Control Models Without Acceleration Measurements
Authors: Ibrahim Laiche, Mokrane Boudaoud, Patrick Gallinari, Pascal Morin
Abstract: This article investigates the modeling and control of Lagrangian systems involving non-conservative forces using a hybrid method that does not require acceleration calculations. It focuses in particular on the derivation and identification of physically consistent models, which are essential for model-based control synthesis. Lagrangian or Hamiltonian neural networks provide useful structural guarantees but the learning of such models often leads to inconsistent models, especially on real physical systems where training data are limited, partial and noisy. Motivated by this observation and the objective to exploit these models for model-based nonlinear control, a learning algorithm relying on an original loss function is proposed to improve the physical consistency of Lagrangian systems. A comparative analysis of different learning-based modeling approaches with the proposed solution shows significant improvements in terms of physical consistency of the learned models, on both simulated and experimental systems. The model's consistency is then exploited to demonstrate, on an experimental benchmark, the practical relevance of the proposed methodology for feedback linearization and energy-based control techniques.

Title: Parallel Multi-Circuit Quantum Feature Fusion in Hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Networks for Breast Tumor Classification
Authors: Ece Yurtseven
Abstract: Quantum machine learning has emerged as a promising approach to improve feature extraction and classification tasks in high-dimensional data domains such as medical imaging. In this work, we present a hybrid Quantum-Classical Convolutional Neural Network (QCNN) architecture designed for the binary classification of the BreastMNIST dataset, a standardized benchmark for distinguishing between benign and malignant breast tumors. Our architecture integrates classical convolutional feature extraction with two distinct quantum circuits: an amplitude-encoding variational quantum circuit (VQC) and an angle-encoding VQC circuit with circular entanglement, both implemented on four qubits. These circuits generate quantum feature embeddings that are fused with classical features to form a joint feature space, which is subsequently processed by a fully connected classifier. To ensure fairness, the hybrid QCNN is parameter-matched against a baseline classical CNN, allowing us to isolate the contribution of quantum layers. Both models are trained under identical conditions using the Adam optimizer and binary cross-entropy loss. Experimental evaluation in five independent runs demonstrates that the hybrid QCNN achieves statistically significant improvements in classification accuracy compared to the classical CNN, as validated by a one-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test (p = 0.03125) and supported by large effect size of Cohen's d = 2.14. Our results indicate that hybrid QCNN architectures can leverage entanglement and quantum feature fusion to enhance medical image classification tasks. This work establishes a statistical validation framework for assessing hybrid quantum models in biomedical applications and highlights pathways for scaling to larger datasets and deployment on near-term quantum hardware.

Title: Robust Geospatial Coordination of Multi-Agent Communications Networks Under Attrition
Authors: Jonathan S. Kent, Eliana Stefani, Brian K. Plancher
Abstract: Fast, efficient, robust communication during wildfire and other emergency responses is critical. One way to achieve this is by coordinating swarms of autonomous aerial vehicles carrying communications equipment to form an ad-hoc network connecting emergency response personnel to both each other and central command. However, operating in such extreme environments may lead to individual networking agents being damaged or rendered inoperable, which could bring down the network and interrupt communications. To overcome this challenge and enable multi-agent UAV networking in difficult environments, this paper introduces and formalizes the problem of Robust Task Networking Under Attrition (RTNUA), which extends connectivity maintenance in multi-robot systems to explicitly address proactive redundancy and attrition recovery. We introduce Physics-Informed Robust Employment of Multi-Agent Networks ($\Phi$IREMAN), a topological algorithm leveraging physics-inspired potential fields to solve this problem. Through simulation across 25 problem configurations, $\Phi$IREMAN consistently outperforms the DCCRS baseline, and on large-scale problems with up to 100 tasks and 500 drones, maintains $>99.9\%$ task uptime despite substantial attrition, demonstrating both effectiveness and scalability.

Title: Low-Power Double RIS-Assisted Mobile LEO Satellite Communications
Authors: Kunnathully Sadanandan Sanila, Rickard Nilsson, Emad Ibrahim, Neelakandan Rajamohan
Abstract: We propose a low-power mobile low earth orbit (LEO) satellite communication architecture, employing double reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency and signal performance. With a distance between RISs that satisfies the far-field requirement, this architecture positions one small RIS each in the near-field of the satellite's antenna and the user on the ground. Moreover, we develop a path loss model for the double-RIS communication link, considering the near-field and far-field effects. Further, with the help of dual-stage beamforming, the proposed system maximizes the signal power and minimizes power consumption. Simulation results show that the proposed architecture can reduce the power consumption with 40 dB in the uplink, with a small $0.25^2$ $\text{m}^2$ RIS near the user, to communicate in energy-constrained LEO satellite communication circumstances.

Title: Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flow Matching for Climate Emulation
Authors: Jeremy Andrew Irvin, Jiaqi Han, Zikui Wang, Abdulaziz Alharbi, Yufei Zhao, Nomin-Erdene Bayarsaikhan, Daniele Visioni, Andrew Y. Ng, Duncan Watson-Parris
Abstract: Generative models have the potential to transform the way we emulate Earth's changing climate. Previous generative approaches rely on weather-scale autoregression for climate emulation, but this is inherently slow for long climate horizons and has yet to demonstrate stable rollouts under nonstationary forcings. Here, we introduce Spatiotemporal Pyramid Flows (SPF), a new class of flow matching approaches that model data hierarchically across spatial and temporal scales. Inspired by cascaded video models, SPF partitions the generative trajectory into a spatiotemporal pyramid, progressively increasing spatial resolution to reduce computation and coupling each stage with an associated timescale to enable direct sampling at any temporal level in the pyramid. This design, together with conditioning each stage on prescribed physical forcings (e.g., greenhouse gases or aerosols), enables efficient, parallel climate emulation at multiple timescales. On ClimateBench, SPF outperforms strong flow matching baselines and pre-trained models at yearly and monthly timescales while offering fast sampling, especially at coarser temporal levels. To scale SPF, we curate ClimateSuite, the largest collection of Earth system simulations to date, comprising over 33,000 simulation-years across ten climate models and the first dataset to include simulations of climate interventions. We find that the scaled SPF model demonstrates good generalization to held-out scenarios across climate models. Together, SPF and ClimateSuite provide a foundation for accurate, efficient, probabilistic climate emulation across temporal scales and realistic future scenarios.

Title: The xApp Store: A Framework for xApp Onboarding and Deployment in O-RAN
Authors: Philip Rodgers, Paul Harvey
Abstract: 5G and beyond mobile telecommunication networks are increasingly embracing software technologies in their operation and control, similar to what has powered the growth of the cloud. This is most recently seen in the radio access network (RAN). In this new approach, the RAN is increasingly controlled by software applications known as xApps, and opens the door to third party development of xApps bringing diversity to the ecosystem, similar to mobile phone apps. This model aligns closely with the controllers in the ITU-T architecture for autonomous networks, and provides a pathway towards autonomous operation in the RAN. Unfortunately, no marketplace to host or supply xApps currently exists. This work describes our experiences in leveraging open-source O-RAN implementations to design and develop an xApp store.

Abstract: Spoken conversational agents are converging toward voice-native LLMs. This tutorial distills the path from cascaded ASR/NLU to end-to-end, retrieval-and vision-grounded systems. We frame adaptation of text LLMs to audio, cross-modal alignment, and joint speech-text training; review datasets, metrics, and robustness across accents and compare design choices (cascaded vs. E2E, post-ASR correction, streaming). We link industrial assistants to current open-domain and task-oriented agents, highlight reproducible baselines, and outline open problems in privacy, safety, and evaluation. Attendees leave with practical recipes and a clear systems-level roadmap.

Title: Adapting Tensor Kernel Machines to Enable Efficient Transfer Learning for Seizure Detection
Authors: Seline J.S. de Rooij, Borbála Hunyadi
Abstract: Transfer learning aims to optimize performance in a target task by learning from a related source problem. In this work, we propose an efficient transfer learning method using a tensor kernel machine. Our method takes inspiration from the adaptive SVM and hence transfers 'knowledge' from the source to the 'adapted' model via regularization. The main advantage of using tensor kernel machines is that they leverage low-rank tensor networks to learn a compact non-linear model in the primal domain. This allows for a more efficient adaptation without adding more parameters to the model. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply the adaptive tensor kernel machine (Adapt-TKM) to seizure detection on behind-the-ear EEG. By personalizing patient-independent models with a small amount of patient-specific data, the patient-adapted model (which utilizes the Adapt-TKM), achieves better performance compared to the patient-independent and fully patient-specific models. Notably, it is able to do so while requiring around 100 times fewer parameters than the adaptive SVM model, leading to a correspondingly faster inference speed. This makes the Adapt-TKM especially useful for resource-constrained wearable devices.

Title: Hear What Matters! Text-conditioned Selective Video-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Junwon Lee, Juhan Nam, Jiyoung Lee
Abstract: This work introduces a new task, text-conditioned selective video-to-audio (V2A) generation, which produces only the user-intended sound from a multi-object video. This capability is especially crucial in multimedia production, where audio tracks are handled individually for each sound source for precise editing, mixing, and creative control. However, current approaches generate single source-mixed sounds at once, largely because visual features are entangled, and region cues or prompts often fail to specify the source. We propose SelVA, a novel text-conditioned V2A model that treats the text prompt as an explicit selector of target source and modulates video encoder to distinctly extract prompt-relevant video features. The proposed supplementary tokens promote cross-attention by suppressing text-irrelevant activations with efficient parameter tuning, yielding robust semantic and temporal grounding. SelVA further employs a self-augmentation scheme to overcome the lack of mono audio track supervision. We evaluate SelVA on VGG-MONOAUDIO, a curated benchmark of clean single-source videos for such a task. Extensive experiments and ablations consistently verify its effectiveness across audio quality, semantic alignment, and temporal synchronization. Code and demo are available at this https URL.

Title: Double-Helix based Real-Time Single Particle Tracking
Authors: Md Faysal Hossain, Sean B. Andersson
Abstract: In Real-Time, Feedback-Driven Single Particle Tracking methods, measurements of the emission intensity from a labeled, nanometer-scale particle are used in a feedback loop to track the motion of the particle as it moves inside its native environment, including within living cells. In this work, we take advantage of Point Spread Function (PSF) engineering techniques that encode the axial position of the particle into the shape of the PSF in the focal plane to eliminate the need for out-of-focal-plane measurements, reducing the complexity of implementation and decreasing the overall measurement time of the control loop. Specifically, we used the Double Helix PSF (DH-PSF) in which a single fluorescent source gives rise to two lobes in the image plane with the lobes rotating in the plane as the particle moves along the optical axis. We designed simple estimators of the relative error between the particle and the tracker, and a simple proportional feedback controller to regulate that error to zero. We explored the efficacy of the approach through simulation studies, demonstrating the tracking of fast-moving particles (with diffusion coefficients up to 10 {\mu\text{m}^2/\text{s}}) over long time periods (multiple seconds).

Title: Malaria detection using Deep Convolution Neural Network
Authors: Sumit Kumar, Harsh Vardhan, Sneha Priya, Ayush Kumar
Abstract: The latest WHO report showed that the number of malaria cases climbed to 219 million last year, two million higher than last year. The global efforts to fight malaria have hit a plateau and the most significant underlying reason is international funding has declined. Malaria, which is spread to people through the bites of infected female mosquitoes, occurs in 91 countries but about 90% of the cases and deaths are in sub-Saharan Africa. The disease killed 4,35,000 people last year, the majority of them children under five in Africa. AI-backed technology has revolutionized malaria detection in some regions of Africa and the future impact of such work can be revolutionary. The malaria Cell Image Data-set is taken from the official NIH Website NIH data. The aim of the collection of the dataset was to reduce the burden for microscopists in resource-constrained regions and improve diagnostic accuracy using an AI-based algorithm to detect and segment the red blood cells. The goal of this work is to show that the state of the art accuracy can be obtained even by using 2 layer convolution network and show a new baseline in Malaria detection efforts using AI.

Title: Quick Updates for the Perturbed Static Output Feedback Control Problem in Linear Systems with Applications to Power Systems
Authors: MirSaleh Bahavarnia, Ahmad F. Taha
Abstract: This paper introduces a method for efficiently updating a nominal stabilizing static output feedback (SOF) controller in perturbed linear systems. As operating points and state-space matrices change in dynamic systems, accommodating updates to the SOF controller are necessary. Traditional methods address such changes by re-solving for the updated SOF gain, which is often (i) computationally expensive due to the NP-hard nature of the problem or (ii) infeasible due to the limitations of its semidefinite programming relaxations. To overcome this, we leverage the concept of minimum destabilizing real perturbation (MDRP) to formulate a norm minimization problem that yields fast, reliable controller updates. This approach accommodates a variety of known perturbations, including abrupt changes, model inaccuracies, and equilibrium-dependent linearizations. We remark that the application of our proposed approach is limited to the class of SOF controllers in perturbed linear systems. We also introduce geometric metrics to quantify the proximity to instability and rigorously define stability-guaranteed regions. Extensive numerical simulations validate the efficiency and robustness of the proposed method. Moreover, such extensive numerical simulations corroborate that although we utilize a heuristic optimization method to compute the MDRP, it performs quite well in practice compared to an existing approximation method in the literature, namely the hybrid expansion-contraction (HEC) method. We demonstrate the results on the SOF control of multi-machine power networks with changing operating points, and demonstrate that the computed quick updates produce comparable solutions to the traditional SOF ones, while requiring orders of magnitude less computational time.

Title: ContourDiff: Unpaired Medical Image Translation with Structural Consistency
Authors: Yuwen Chen, Nicholas Konz, Hanxue Gu, Haoyu Dong, Yaqian Chen, Lin Li, Jisoo Lee, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Accurately translating medical images between different modalities, such as Computed Tomography (CT) to Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), has numerous downstream clinical and machine learning applications. While several methods have been proposed to achieve this, they often prioritize perceptual quality with respect to output domain features over preserving anatomical fidelity. However, maintaining anatomy during translation is essential for many tasks, e.g., when leveraging masks from the input domain to develop a segmentation model with images translated to the output domain. To address these challenges, we propose ContourDiff with Spatially Coherent Guided Diffusion (SCGD), a novel framework that leverages domain-invariant anatomical contour representations of images. These representations are simple to extract from images, yet form precise spatial constraints on their anatomical content. We introduce a diffusion model that converts contour representations of images from arbitrary input domains into images in the output domain of interest. By applying the contour as a constraint at every diffusion sampling step, we ensure the preservation of anatomical content. We evaluate our method on challenging lumbar spine and hip-and-thigh CT-to-MRI translation tasks, via (1) the performance of segmentation models trained on translated images applied to real MRIs, and (2) the foreground FID and KID of translated images with respect to real MRIs. Our method outperforms other unpaired image translation methods by a significant margin across almost all metrics and scenarios. Moreover, it achieves this without the need to access any input domain information during training and we further verify its zero-shot capability, showing that a model trained on one anatomical region can be directly applied to unseen regions without retraining (GitHub: this https URL).

Title: Energy-Efficient Multi-UAV-Enabled MEC Systems over Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Wenchao Liu, Xuhui Zhang, Chunjie Wang, Jinke Ren, Zheng Xing, Bo Yang, Shuqiang Wang, Yanyan Shen
Abstract: With the development of artificial intelligence integrated next-generation communication networks, mobile users (MUs) are increasingly demanding the efficient processing of computation-intensive and latency-sensitive tasks. However, existing mobile computing networks struggle to support the rapidly growing computational needs of the MUs. Fortunately, space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) supported mobile edge computing (MEC) is regarded as an effective solution, offering the MUs multi-tier and efficient computing services. In this paper, we consider an SAGIN supported MEC system, where a low Earth orbit satellite and multiple unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are dispatched to provide computing services for MUs. An energy efficiency maximization problem is formulated, with the joint optimization of the MU-UAV association, the UAV trajectory, the task offloading decision, the computing frequency, and the transmission power control. Since the problem is non-convex, we decompose it into four subproblems, and propose an alternating optimization based algorithm to solve it. Simulation results confirm that the proposed algorithm outperforms the benchmarks.

Title: An Uncertainty Quantification Framework for Deep Learning-Based Automatic Modulation Classification
Authors: Huian Yang, Rajeev Sahay
Abstract: Deep learning has been shown to be highly effective for automatic modulation classification (AMC), which is a pivotal technology for next-generation cognitive communications. Yet, existing deep learning methods for AMC often lack robust mechanisms for uncertainty quantification (UQ). This limitation restricts their ability to produce accurate and reliable predictions in real-world environments, where signals can be perturbed as a result of several factors such as interference and low signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). To address this problem, we propose a deep ensemble approach that leverages multiple convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate predictive distributions, as opposed to point estimates produced by standard deep learning models, which produce statistical characteristics that quantify the uncertainty associated with each prediction. We validate our approach using real-world AMC data, evaluating performance through multiple UQ metrics in a variety of signal environments. Our results show that our proposed ensemble-based framework captures uncertainty to a greater degree compared to previously proposed baselines in multiple settings, including in-distribution samples, out-of-distribution samples, and low SNR signals. These findings highlight the strong UQ capabilities of our ensemble-based AMC approach, paving the way for more robust deep learning-based AMC.

Title: Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems
Authors: Taoran Wu, Yiling Xue, Jingduo Pan, Dejin Ren, Arvind Easwaran, Bai Xue
Abstract: Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential for safety-critical systems. This paper addresses the problem of computing CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the dynamics are unknown and only limited simulation data are available. Traditionally, a CSIS requires that for every state in the set, there exists a control input that keeps the system within the set at the next step. However, enforcing such universal invariance, i.e., requiring the set to remain controlled invariant for all states, is often overly restrictive or impractical for black-box systems. To address this, we introduce the notion of a Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) CSIS, in which, with prescribed confidence, there exists a suitable control input to keep the system within the set at the next step for at least a specified fraction of the states. Our approach leverages barrier functions and scenario optimization, yielding a tractable linear programming method for estimating PAC CSISs. Several illustrative examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Title: A Switched Systems Approach to Image-Based Feature Tracking for Autonomous Satellite Inspection
Authors: Tochukwu Elijah Ogri, Muzaffar Qureshi, Zachary I. Bell, Wanjiku A. Makumi, Kyle Volle, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: This paper presents an information-based guidance and control architecture for an autonomous deputy spacecraft tasked with inspecting a chief satellite in orbit. The primary objective is for the deputy spacecraft to maximize information gain while tracking features on the chief satellite. The deputy spacecraft needs to respect various constraints such as illumination, field-of-view (FOV), fuel limitations, and avoidance regions. Additionally, the absence of GPS information poses a significant challenge for relative localization within the space environment. To learn the structure of the chief satellite while achieving relative self-localization and maximizing the information gain, this paper integrates a memory regression extension (MRE)-based distance observer with an information-maximizing adaptive controller. The distance observer utilizes feedback from a camera. A switched systems approach is used to determine the minimum dwell time required for a feature to remain within the FOV of the camera to ensure accurate estimation. A k-means clustering algorithm acts as a high-level planner to intermittently generate goal locations that guide the deputy spacecraft toward the nearest cluster of uninspected points on the chief satellite, subject to illumination and FOV constraints. A Lyapunov-based stability analysis is conducted to analyze the developed architecture, and simulation results validate the theoretical results of the paper.

Title: Coordinated Decentralized Resource Optimization for Cell-Free ISAC Systems
Authors: Mehdi Zafari, Rang Liu, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is emerging as a key enabler for 6G wireless networks, allowing the joint use of spectrum and infrastructure for both communication and sensing. While prior ISAC solutions have addressed resource optimization, including power allocation, beamforming, and waveform design, they often rely on centralized architectures with full network knowledge, limiting their scalability in distributed systems. In this paper, we propose two coordinated decentralized optimization algorithms for beamforming and power allocation tailored to cell-free ISAC networks. The first algorithm employs locally designed fixed beamformers at access points (APs), combined with a centralized power allocation scheme computed at a central server (CS). The second algorithm jointly optimizes beamforming and power control through a fully decentralized consensus ADMM framework. Both approaches rely on local information at APs and limited coordination with the CS. Simulation results obtained using our proposed Python-based simulation framework evaluate their fronthaul overhead and system-level performance, demonstrating their practicality for scalable ISAC deployment in decentralized, cell-free architectures.

Title: Zero-shot self-supervised learning of single breath-hold magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP) reconstruction
Authors: Jinho Kim, Marcel Dominik Nickel, Florian Knoll
Abstract: To investigate the feasibility of zero-shot self-supervised learning reconstruction for reducing breath-hold times in magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography (MRCP). Breath-hold MRCP was acquired from 11 healthy volunteers on 3T scanners using an incoherent k-space sampling pattern, leading to 14-second acquisition time and an acceleration factor of R=25. Zero-shot reconstruction was compared with parallel imaging of respiratory-triggered MRCP (338s, R=3) and compressed sensing reconstruction. For two volunteers, breath-hold scans (40s, R=6) were additionally acquired and retrospectively undersampled to R=25 to compute peak signal-to-noise ratio (PSNR). To address long zero-shot training time, the n+m full stages of the zero-shot learning were divided into two parts to reduce backpropagation depth during training: 1) n frozen stages initialized with n-stage pretrained network and 2) m trainable stages initialized either randomly or m-stage pretrained network. Efficiency of our approach was assessed by varying initialization strategies and the number of trainable stages using the retrospectively undersampled data. Zero-shot reconstruction significantly improved visual image quality over compressed sensing, particularly in SNR and ductal delineation, and achieved image quality comparable to that of successful respiratory-triggered acquisitions with regular breathing patterns. Improved initializations enhanced PSNR and reduced reconstruction time. Adjusting frozen/trainable configurations demonstrated that PSNR decreased only slightly from 38.25 dB (0/13) to 37.67 dB (12/1), while training time decreased up to 6.7-fold. Zero-shot learning delivers high-fidelity MRCP reconstructions with reduced breath-hold times, and the proposed partially trainable approach offers a practical solution for translation into time-constrained clinical workflows.

Title: Cross-Cancer Knowledge Transfer in WSI-based Prognosis Prediction
Authors: Pei Liu, Luping Ji, Jiaxiang Gou, Xiangxiang Zeng
Abstract: Whole-Slide Image (WSI) is an important tool for estimating cancer prognosis. Current studies generally follow a conventional cancer-specific paradigm in which each cancer corresponds to a single model. However, this paradigm naturally struggles to scale to rare tumors and cannot leverage knowledge from other cancers. While multi-task learning frameworks have been explored recently, they often place high demands on computational resources and require extensive training on ultra-large, multi-cancer WSI datasets. To this end, this paper shifts the paradigm to knowledge transfer and presents the first preliminary yet systematic study on cross-cancer prognosis knowledge transfer in WSIs, called CROPKT. It comprises three major parts. (1) We curate a large dataset (UNI2-h-DSS) with 26 cancers and use it to measure the transferability of WSI-based prognostic knowledge across different cancers (including rare tumors). (2) Beyond a simple evaluation merely for benchmarking, we design a range of experiments to gain deeper insights into the underlying mechanism behind transferability. (3) We further show the utility of cross-cancer knowledge transfer, by proposing a routing-based baseline approach (ROUPKT) that could often efficiently utilize the knowledge transferred from off-the-shelf models of other cancers. CROPKT could serve as an inception that lays the foundation for this nascent paradigm, i.e., WSI-based prognosis prediction with cross-cancer knowledge transfer.

Title: Random forest-based out-of-distribution detection for robust lung cancer segmentation
Authors: Aneesh Rangnekar, Harini Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Accurate detection and segmentation of cancerous lesions from computed tomography (CT) scans is essential for automated treatment planning and cancer treatment response assessment. Transformer-based models with self-supervised pretraining have achieved strong performance on in-distribution (ID) data but often generalize poorly on out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs. We investigate this behavior for lung cancer segmentation using an encoder-decoder model. Our encoder is a Swin Transformer pretrained with masked image modeling (SimMIM) on 10,432 unlabeled 3D CT scans spanning cancerous and non-cancerous conditions, and the decoder was randomly initialized. This model was evaluated on an independent ID test set and four OOD scenarios, including chest CT cohorts (pulmonary embolism and negative COVID-19) and abdomen CT cohorts (kidney cancers and non-cancerous pancreas). OOD detection was performed at the scan level using RF-Deep, a random forest classifier applied to contextual tumor-anchored feature representations. We evaluated 920 3D CTs (172,650 images) and observed that RF-Deep achieved FPR95 values of 18.26% and 27.66% on the chest CT cohorts, and near-perfect detection (less than 0.1% FPR95) on the abdomen CT cohorts, consistently outperforming established OOD methods. These results demonstrate that our RF-Deep classifier provides a simple, lightweight, and effective approach for enhancing the reliability of segmentation models in clinical deployment.

Title: Ray-Tracing Based Narrow-Beam Channel Simulation, Characterization and Performance Evaluation for 5G-R Systems
Authors: Tao Zhou, Liying Geng, Kaifeng Bao, Tianyun Feng, Liu Liu, Bo Ai
Abstract: This paper investigates narrow-beam channel characterization and performance evaluation for 5G for railway (5G-R) systems based on ray-tracing (RT) simulation. Three representative high-speed railway (HSR) scenarios including viaduct, cutting, and station are established, and RT-based dynamic narrow-beam channel simulations are conducted using a designed beam tracking scheme that ensures continuous alignment with the moving train. The channel characteristics are analyzed in terms of both large-scale and small-scale fading, as well as non-stationarity, providing statistical insights into path loss, shadow fading, fading severity, time-frequency-space dispersion, and stationarity interval. The influence of beamwidth on these channel properties is also examined. Furthermore, the performance of 5G-R systems operating in such narrow-beam channels is evaluated using the Vienna 5G simulator, with a focus on block error rate, throughput, and spectral efficiency. A hardware-in-the-loop simulation platform is developed to further assess synchronization signal reference signal received power, signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio, and reference signal received quality. The results provide valuable guidance for the design and optimization of 5G-R systems in HSR environments.

Title: IDMap: A Pseudo-Speaker Generator Framework Based on Speaker Identity Index to Vector Mapping
Authors: Zeyan Liu, Liping Chen, Kong Aik Lee, Zhenhua Ling
Abstract: Facilitated by the speech generation framework that disentangles speech into content, speaker, and prosody, voice anonymization is accomplished by substituting the original speaker embedding vector with that of a pseudo-speaker. In this framework, the pseudo-speaker generation forms a fundamental challenge. Current pseudo-speaker generation methods demonstrate limitations in the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, consequently restricting their effectiveness in voice privacy protection. Besides, existing model-based methods suffer from heavy computation costs. Especially, in the large-scale scenario where a huge number of pseudo-speakers are generated, the limitations of uniqueness and computational inefficiency become more significant. To this end, this paper proposes a framework for pseudo-speaker generation, which establishes a mapping from speaker identity index to speaker vector in the feedforward architecture, termed IDMap. Specifically, the framework is specified into two models: IDMap-MLP and IDMap-Diff. Experiments were conducted on both small- and large-scale evaluation datasets. Small-scale evaluations on the LibriSpeech dataset validated the effectiveness of the proposed IDMap framework in enhancing the uniqueness of pseudo-speakers, thereby improving voice privacy protection, while at a reduced computational cost. Large-scale evaluations on the MLS and Common Voice datasets further justified the superiority of the IDMap framework regarding the stability of the voice privacy protection capability as the number of pseudo-speakers increased.

Title: Dissipativity-Based Synthesis of Distributed Control and Communication Topology Co-Design for AC Microgrids
Authors: Mohammad Javad Najafirad, Shirantha Welikala, Lei Wu, Panos J. Antsaklis
Abstract: This paper introduces a dissipativity-based framework for the joint design of distributed controllers and communication topologies in AC microgrids (MGs), providing robust performance guarantees for voltage regulation, frequency synchronization, and proportional power sharing across distributed generators (DGs). The closed-loop AC MG is represented as a networked system in which DGs, distribution lines, and loads function as interconnected subsystems linked through cyber-physical networks. Each DG utilizes a three-layer hierarchical control structure: a steady-state controller for operating point configuration, a local feedback controller for voltage tracking, and a distributed droop-free controller implementing normalized power consensus for frequency coordination and proportional power distribution. The operating point design is formulated as an optimization problem. Leveraging dissipativity theory, we derive necessary and sufficient subsystem dissipativity conditions. The global co-design is then cast as a convex linear matrix inequality (LMI) optimization that jointly determines distributed controller parameters and sparse communication architecture while managing the highly nonlinear, coupled dq-frame dynamics characteristic of AC systems.

Title: Self-Supervised Compression and Artifact Correction for Streaming Underwater Imaging Sonar
Authors: Rongsheng Qian, Chi Xu, Xiaoqiang Ma, Hao Fang, Yili Jin, William I. Atlas, Jiangchuan Liu
Abstract: Real-time imaging sonar is crucial for underwater monitoring where optical sensing fails, but its use is limited by low uplink bandwidth and severe sonar-specific artifacts (speckle, motion blur, reverberation, acoustic shadows) affecting up to 98% of frames. We present SCOPE, a self-supervised framework that jointly performs compression and artifact correction without clean-noise pairs or synthetic assumptions. SCOPE combines (i) Adaptive Codebook Compression (ACC), which learns frequency-encoded latent representations tailored to sonar, with (ii) Frequency-Aware Multiscale Segmentation (FAMS), which decomposes frames into low-frequency structure and sparse high-frequency dynamics while suppressing rapidly fluctuating artifacts. A hedging training strategy further guides frequency-aware learning using low-pass proxy pairs generated without labels. Evaluated on months of in-situ ARIS sonar data, SCOPE achieves a structural similarity index (SSIM) of 0.77, representing a 40% improvement over prior self-supervised denoising baselines, at bitrates down to <= 0.0118 bpp. It reduces uplink bandwidth by more than 80% while improving downstream detection. The system runs in real time, with 3.1 ms encoding on an embedded GPU and 97 ms full multi-layer decoding on the server end. SCOPE has been deployed for months in three Pacific Northwest rivers to support real-time salmon enumeration and environmental monitoring in the wild. Results demonstrate that learning frequency-structured latents enables practical, low-bitrate sonar streaming with preserved signal details under real-world deployment conditions.

Title: Observer Design for Networked Linear Systems with Fast and Slow Dynamics under Measurement Noise
Authors: Weixuan Wang, Alejandro I. Maass, Dragan Nešić, Ying Tan, Romain Postoyan, W.P.M.H. Heemels
Abstract: This paper addresses the emulation-based observer design for networked control systems (NCS) with linear plants that operate at two time scales in the presence of measurement noise. The system is formulated as a hybrid singularly perturbed dynamical system, enabling the systematic use of singular perturbation techniques to derive explicit bounds on the maximum allowable transmission intervals (MATI) for both fast and slow communication channels. Under the resulting conditions, the proposed observer guarantees that the estimation error satisfies a global exponential derivative-input-to-state stability (DISS)-like property, where the ultimate bound scales proportionally with the magnitudes of the measurement noise and the time derivative of the control input. The effectiveness of the approach is illustrated through a numerical example.

Authors: Mohammad Khateri, Serge Vasylechko, Morteza Ghahremani, Liam Timms, Deniz Kocanaogullari, Simon K. Warfield, Camilo Jaimes, Davood Karimi, Alejandra Sierra, Jussi Tohka, Sila Kurugol, Onur Afacan
Abstract: High-resolution (HR) magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is crucial for many clinical and research applications. However, achieving it remains costly and constrained by technical trade-offs and experimental limitations. Super-resolution (SR) presents a promising computational approach to overcome these challenges by generating HR images from more affordable low-resolution (LR) scans, potentially improving diagnostic accuracy and efficiency without requiring additional hardware. This survey reviews recent advances in MRI SR techniques, with a focus on deep learning (DL) approaches. It examines DL-based MRI SR methods from the perspectives of computer vision, computational imaging, inverse problems, and MR physics, covering theoretical foundations, architectural designs, learning strategies, benchmark datasets, and performance metrics. We propose a systematic taxonomy to categorize these methods and present an in-depth study of both established and emerging SR techniques applicable to MRI, considering unique challenges in clinical and research contexts. We also highlight open challenges and directions that the community needs to address. Additionally, we provide a collection of essential open-access resources, tools, and tutorials, available on our GitHub: this https URL.

Title: Quantized Distributed Estimation with Event-triggered Communication and Packet Loss
Authors: Ying Wang, Yanlong Zhao, Ji-Feng Zhang, Karl Henrik Johansson
Abstract: This paper focuses on the problem of quantized distributed estimation with event-triggered communication and packet loss, aiming to reduce the number of transmitted bits. The main challenge lies in the inability to differentiate between an untriggered event and a packet loss occurrence. This paper proposes an event-triggered distributed estimation algorithm with quantized communication and quantized measurement, in which it introduces a one-bit information reconstruction method to deal with packet loss. The almost sure convergence and convergence rate of the proposed algorithm are established. Besides, it is demonstrated that the global average communication bit-rate decreases to zero over time. Moreover, the trade-off between communication rate and convergence rate is revealed, providing guidance for designing the communication rate required to achieve the algorithm's convergence rate. A numerical example is supplied to validate the findings.

Title: Data-Efficient Motor Condition Monitoring with Time Series Foundation Models
Authors: Deyu Li, Xinyuan Liao, Shaowei Chen, Shuai Zhao
Abstract: Motor condition monitoring is essential for ensuring system reliability and preventing catastrophic failures. However, data-driven diagnostic methods often suffer from sparse fault labels and severe class imbalance, which limit their effectiveness in real-world applications. This paper proposes a motor condition monitoring framework that leverages the general features learned during pre-training of two time series foundation models, MOMENT and Mantis, to address these challenges. By transferring broad temporal representations from large-scale pre-training, the proposed approach significantly reduces dependence on labeled data while maintaining high diagnostic accuracy. Experimental results show that MOMENT achieves nearly twice the performance of conventional deep learning models using only 1% of the training data, whereas Mantis surpasses state-of-the-art baselines by 22%, reaching 90% accuracy with the same data ratio. These results demonstrate the strong generalization and data efficiency of time series foundation models in fault diagnosis, providing new insights into scalable and adaptive frameworks for intelligent motor condition monitoring.

Title: An innovative circuit for testing hot carrier and trap generation in GaN Devices
Authors: Moshe Azoulay, Gilad Orr, Gady Golan
Abstract: Microelectronic devices in modern systems are working continuously for prolonged periods of many years. Thus, there is a crucial need for reliability model that will enable us to predict precisely the life cycle of the device and point out on the governing failure mechanisms that are responsible for degradation and failure. This is even more important when high power and frequency devices, especially Normally Off Switch Power transistors are concerned, since the reliability research on those devices lay far behind that of low power digital devices. Our main goal in our lab is to investigate the failure mechanisms of GaN transistors, aimed at determining the reliability factors of the innovative MTOL model. The main goal is to understand the reason for the transformation of the failure mechanism. Employing the recorded data may enable us to predict the performance and life time of the device at different operation parameters such as current, voltage, frequency and temperatures. In this study we employ a new different use for the well-known boost convertor circuit, based on GaN Devices in order to stress the transistor to the maximum values of voltage and current which allows us to examine the reliability of the transistor and accelerating Hot Carrier And Trap Generation failures mechanisms. The acceleration of the failure mechanism should be done in a way that will not affect the electronic device detrimentally and on the other hand we would not need to wait a long time in order to observe the degradation. In this work we will present our new boost converter circuit based on high power GaN HEMT.

Title: Ergodic-risk Criterion for Stochastically Stabilizing Policy Optimization
Authors: Shahriar Talebi, Na Li
Abstract: This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks associated with controlled Markov chains through probabilistic limit theorems--in contrast to existing methods that require assumptions of either finite hitting time, finite state/action space, or exponentiation necessitating light-tailed distributions. Using tailored Functional Central Limit Theorems (FCLT), we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in the ergodic-risk criteria converge under uniform ergodicity and establish conditions for the convergence of these criteria in non-stationary general-state Markov chains involving heavy-tailed distributions. For quadratic risk functionals on stochastic linear systems, in addition to internal stability, this requires the (possibly heavy-tailed) process noise to have only a finite fourth moment. After quantifying cumulative uncertainties in risk functionals that account for extreme deviations, these ergodic-risk criteria are then incorporated into policy optimizations, thereby extending the standard average optimal synthesis to a risk-sensitive framework. Finally, by establishing the strong duality of the constrained policy optimization, we propose a primal-dual algorithm that optimizes average performance while ensuring that certain risks associated with these ergodic-risk criteria are constrained. Our risk-sensitive framework offers a theoretically guaranteed policy iteration for the long-term risk-sensitive control of processes involving heavy-tailed noise, which is shown to be effective through several simulations.

Title: CSI-BERT2: A BERT-inspired Framework for Efficient CSI Prediction and Classification in Wireless Communication and Sensing
Authors: Zijian Zhao, Fanyi Meng, Zhonghao Lyu, Hang Li, Xiaoyang Li, Guangxu Zhu
Abstract: Channel state information (CSI) is a fundamental component in both wireless communication and sensing systems, enabling critical functions such as radio resource optimization and environmental perception. In wireless sensing, data scarcity and packet loss hinder efficient model training, while in wireless communication, high-dimensional CSI matrices and short coherent times caused by high mobility present challenges in CSI estimation. To address these issues, we propose a unified framework named CSI-BERT2 for CSI prediction and classification tasks, built on CSI-BERT, which adapts BERT to capture the complex relationships among CSI sequences through a bidirectional self-attention mechanism. We introduce a two-stage training method that first uses a mask language model (MLM) to enable the model to learn general feature extraction from scarce datasets in an unsupervised manner, followed by fine-tuning for specific downstream tasks. Specifically, we extend MLM into a mask prediction model (MPM), which efficiently addresses the CSI prediction task. To further enhance the representation capacity of CSI data, we modify the structure of the original CSI-BERT. We introduce an adaptive re-weighting layer (ARL) to enhance subcarrier representation and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP)-based temporal embedding module to mitigate temporal information loss problem inherent in the original Transformer. Extensive experiments on both real-world collected and simulated datasets demonstrate that CSI-BERT2 achieves state-of-the-art performance across all tasks. Our results further show that CSI-BERT2 generalizes effectively across varying sampling rates and robustly handles discontinuous CSI sequences caused by packet loss-challenges that conventional methods fail to address. The dataset and code are publicly available at this https URL .

Title: Efficient Policy Optimization in Robust Constrained MDPs with Iteration Complexity Guarantees
Authors: Sourav Ganguly, Arnob Ghosh, Kishan Panaganti, Adam Wierman
Abstract: Constrained decision-making is essential for designing safe policies in real-world control systems, yet simulated environments often fail to capture real-world adversities. We consider the problem of learning a policy that will maximize the cumulative reward while satisfying a constraint, even when there is a mismatch between the real model and an accessible simulator/nominal model. In particular, we consider the robust constrained Markov decision problem (RCMDP) where an agent needs to maximize the reward and satisfy the constraint against the worst possible stochastic model under the uncertainty set centered around an unknown nominal model. Primal-dual methods, effective for standard constrained MDP (CMDP), are not applicable here because of the lack of the strong duality property. Further, one cannot apply the standard robust value-iteration based approach on the composite value function either as the worst case models may be different for the reward value function and the constraint value function. We propose a novel technique that effectively minimizes the constraint value function--to satisfy the constraints; on the other hand, when all the constraints are satisfied, it can simply maximize the robust reward value function. We prove that such an algorithm finds a policy with at most $\epsilon$ sub-optimality and feasible policy after $O(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations. In contrast to the state-of-the-art method, we do not need to employ a binary search, thus, we reduce the computation time by at least 4x for smaller value of discount factor ($\gamma$) and by at least 6x for larger value of $\gamma$.

Title: Text-Queried Audio Source Separation via Hierarchical Modeling
Authors: Xinlei Yin, Xiulian Peng, Xue Jiang, Zhiwei Xiong, Yan Lu
Abstract: Target audio source separation with natural language queries presents a promising paradigm for extracting arbitrary audio events through arbitrary text descriptions. Existing methods mainly face two challenges, the difficulty in jointly modeling acoustic-textual alignment and semantic-aware separation within a blindly-learned single-stage architecture, and the reliance on large-scale accurately-labeled training data to compensate for inefficient cross-modal learning and separation. To address these challenges, we propose a hierarchical decomposition framework, HSM-TSS, that decouples the task into global-local semantic-guided feature separation and structure-preserving acoustic reconstruction. Our approach introduces a dual-stage mechanism for semantic separation, operating on distinct global and local semantic feature spaces. We first perform global-semantic separation through a global semantic feature space aligned with text queries. A Q-Audio architecture is employed to align audio and text modalities, serving as pretrained global-semantic encoders. Conditioned on the predicted global feature, we then perform the second-stage local-semantic separation on AudioMAE features that preserve time-frequency structures, followed by acoustic reconstruction. We also propose an instruction processing pipeline to parse arbitrary text queries into structured operations, extraction or removal, coupled with audio descriptions, enabling flexible sound manipulation. Our method achieves state-of-the-art separation performance with data-efficient training while maintaining superior semantic consistency with queries in complex auditory scenes.

Title: Autocratic strategies in Cournot oligopoly game
Authors: Masahiko Ueda, Shoma Yagi, Genki Ichinose
Abstract: An oligopoly is a market in which the price of goods is controlled by a few firms. Cournot introduced the simplest game-theoretic model of oligopoly, where profit-maximizing behavior of each firm results in market failure. Furthermore, when the Cournot oligopoly game is infinitely repeated, firms can tacitly collude to monopolize the market. Such tacit collusion is realized by the same mechanism as direct reciprocity in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, where mutual cooperation can be realized whereas defection is favorable for both prisoners in a one-shot game. Recently, in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game, a class of strategies called zero-determinant strategies attracts much attention in the context of direct reciprocity. Zero-determinant strategies are autocratic strategies which unilaterally control payoffs of players by enforcing linear relationships between payoffs. There were many attempts to find zero-determinant strategies in other games and to extend them so as to apply them to broader situations. In this paper, first, we show that zero-determinant strategies exist even in the repeated Cournot oligopoly game, and that they are quite different from those in the repeated prisoner's dilemma game. Especially, we prove that a fair zero-determinant strategy exists, which is guaranteed to obtain the average payoff of the opponents. Second, we numerically show that the fair zero-determinant strategy can be used to promote collusion when it is used against an adaptively learning player, whereas it cannot promote collusion when it is used against two adaptively learning players. Our findings elucidate some negative impact of zero-determinant strategies in the oligopoly market.

Title: Beyond Connectivity: An Open Architecture for AI-RAN Convergence in 6G
Authors: Michele Polese, Niloofar Mohamadi, Salvatore D'Oro, Leonardo Bonati, Tommaso Melodia
Abstract: Data-intensive Artificial Intelligence (AI) applications at the network edge demand a fundamental shift in Radio Access Network (RAN) design, from merely consuming AI for network optimization, to actively enabling distributed AI workloads. This presents a significant opportunity for network operators to monetize AI while leveraging existing infrastructure. To realize this vision, this article presents a novel converged O-RAN and AI-RAN architecture for unified orchestration and management of telecommunications and AI workloads on shared infrastructure. The proposed architecture extends the Open RAN principles of modularity, disaggregation, and cloud-nativeness to support heterogeneous AI deployments. We introduce two key architectural innovations: (i) the AI-RAN Orchestrator, which extends the O-RAN Service Management and Orchestration (SMO) to enable integrated resource and allocation across RAN and AI workloads; and (ii) AI-RAN sites that provide distributed edge AI platforms with real-time processing capabilities. The proposed architecture enables flexible orchestration, meeting requirements for managing heterogeneous workloads at different time scales while maintaining open, standardized interfaces and multi-vendor interoperability.

Title: Remotely sensing stress evolution in elastic media: a passive approach to earthquake monitoring
Authors: Nader Shakibay Senobari
Abstract: Stress evolution governs material failure across scales, from microscopic fractures to large earthquakes, yet direct observation of its dynamics in natural systems has remained elusive. Laboratory experiments using active ultrasonic measurements have shown that seismic velocity and attenuation are sensitive to stress, but such monitoring has not previously been achievable remotely or passively. Here we introduce a stress-sensitive frequency-domain transform that enables passive monitoring of stress evolution using ambient seismic or acoustic noise. The method quantifies relative energy shifts between adjacent frequency bands, capturing subtle changes in wave-propagation properties linked to evolving shear and normal stress. Applied across scales, from laboratory stick-slip and slow-slip experiments to natural fault systems including the 2018 Kilauea collapse, Cascadia slow-slip episodes, and major earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku, 2010 Maule, 2002 Denali, and 2023 Turkey-Syria events, the transform consistently reveals distinctive precursory trajectories and stress-cycle patterns. These results demonstrate that stress evolution in elastic Earth materials can be remotely and passively monitored, bridging laboratory rock physics and large-scale seismology and offering a new foundation for real-time tracking of fault mechanics and earthquake preparation.

Title: CPEP: Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training Enhances Gesture Generalization on EMG Signals
Authors: Wenhui Cui, Christopher Sandino, Hadi Pouransari, Ran Liu, Juri Minxha, Ellen Zippi, Aman Verma, Anna Sedlackova, Erdrin Azemi, Behrooz Mahasseni
Abstract: Hand gesture classification using high-quality structured data such as videos, images, and hand skeletons is a well-explored problem in computer vision. Leveraging low-power, cost-effective biosignals, e.g. surface electromyography (sEMG), allows for continuous gesture prediction on wearables. In this paper, we demonstrate that learning representations from weak-modality data that are aligned with those from structured, high-quality data can improve representation quality and enables zero-shot classification. Specifically, we propose a Contrastive Pose-EMG Pre-training (CPEP) framework to align EMG and pose representations, where we learn an EMG encoder that produces high-quality and pose-informative representations. We assess the gesture classification performance of our model through linear probing and zero-shot setups. Our model outperforms emg2pose benchmark models by up to 21% on in-distribution gesture classification and 72% on unseen (out-of-distribution) gesture classification.

Title: Tiny but Mighty: A Software-Hardware Co-Design Approach for Efficient Multimodal Inference on Battery-Powered Small Devices
Authors: Yilong Li, Shuai Zhang, Yijing Zeng, Hao Zhang, Xinmiao Xiong, Jingyu Liu, Pan Hu, Suman Banerjee
Abstract: Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) are inherently modular, consisting of vision and audio encoders, projectors, and large language models. Yet, they are almost always executed monolithically, which underutilizes the heterogeneous accelerators (NPUs, GPUs, DSPs) in modern SoCs and leads to high end-to-end latency. In this paper, we present NANOMIND, a hardware--software co-design inference framework for Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) that breaks large models into modular ``bricks'' (vision, language, audio, etc.) and maps each to its ideal accelerator. The key insight is that large models can be broken into modular components and scheduled to run on the most appropriate compute units. It performs module-level dynamic offloading across accelerators on unified-memory SoCs. By combining customized hardware design, system-level scheduling, and optimized low-bit computation kernels, we demonstrate our framework with a compact, battery-powered device capable of running LMMs entirely on device. This prototype functions as a self-contained intelligent assistant that requires no network connectivity, while achieving higher throughput and superior power efficiency under strict resource constraints. The design further bypasses CPU bottlenecks and reduces redundant memory usage through token-aware buffer management and module-level coordination. Our system outperforms existing implementations in resource efficiency, cutting energy consumption by 42.3\% and GPU memory usage by 11.2\%. This enables a battery-powered device to run LLaVA-OneVision with a camera for nearly 20.8 hours.

Title: Fast 3D Surrogate Modeling for Data Center Thermal Management
Authors: Soumyendu Sarkar, Antonio Guillen-Perez, Zachariah J Carmichael, Avisek Naug, Refik Mert Cam, Vineet Gundecha, Ashwin Ramesh Babu, Sahand Ghorbanpour, Ricardo Luna Gutierrez
Abstract: Reducing energy consumption and carbon emissions in data centers by enabling real-time temperature prediction is critical for sustainability and operational efficiency. Achieving this requires accurate modeling of the 3D temperature field to capture airflow dynamics and thermal interactions under varying operating conditions. Traditional thermal CFD solvers, while accurate, are computationally expensive and require expert-crafted meshes and boundary conditions, making them impractical for real-time use. To address these limitations, we develop a vision-based surrogate modeling framework that operates directly on a 3D voxelized representation of the data center, incorporating server workloads, fan speeds, and HVAC temperature set points. We evaluate multiple architectures, including 3D CNN U-Net variants, a 3D Fourier Neural Operator, and 3D vision transformers, to map these thermal inputs to high-fidelity heat maps. Our results show that the surrogate models generalize across data center configurations and significantly speed up computations (20,000x), from hundreds of milliseconds to hours. This fast and accurate estimation of hot spots and temperature distribution enables real-time cooling control and workload redistribution, leading to substantial energy savings (7\%) and reduced carbon footprint.

Abstract: Spacecraft equipped with multiple propulsion modes or systems can offer enhanced performance and mission flexibility compared with traditional configurations. Despite these benefits, the trajectory optimization of spacecraft utilizing such configurations remains a complex challenge. This paper presents a sequential convex programming (SCP) approach for the optimal design of multi-mode and multi-propulsion spacecraft trajectories. The method extends the dynamical linearization within SCP using sparse automatic differentiation, enabling efficient inclusion of multiple propulsion modes or systems without complex manual reformulation while maintaining comparable computational efficiency. New constraint formulations are introduced to ensure selection of a single propulsion mode at each time step and limit the total number of modes used. The approach is demonstrated for (i) a low-thrust Earth-67P rendezvous using the SPT-140 thruster with 20 discrete modes, and (ii) an Earth-Mars transfer employing both a low-thrust engine and a solar sail. Results confirm that the proposed method can efficiently compute optimal trajectories for these scenarios.
