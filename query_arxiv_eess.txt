Title: In-Context Learning for Label-Efficient Cancer Image Classification in Oncology
Authors: Mobina Shrestha, Bishwas Mandal, Vishal Mandal, Asis Shrestha
Abstract: The application of AI in oncology has been limited by its reliance on large, annotated datasets and the need for retraining models for domain-specific diagnostic tasks. Taking heed of these limitations, we investigated in-context learning as a pragmatic alternative to model retraining by allowing models to adapt to new diagnostic tasks using only a few labeled examples at inference, without the need for retraining. Using four vision-language models (VLMs)-Paligemma, CLIP, ALIGN and GPT-4o, we evaluated the performance across three oncology datasets: MHIST, PatchCamelyon and HAM10000. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to compare the performance of multiple VLMs on different oncology classification tasks. Without any parameter updates, all models showed significant gains with few-shot prompting, with GPT-4o reaching an F1 score of 0.81 in binary classification and 0.60 in multi-class classification settings. While these results remain below the ceiling of fully fine-tuned systems, they highlight the potential of ICL to approximate task-specific behavior using only a handful of examples, reflecting how clinicians often reason from prior cases. Notably, open-source models like Paligemma and CLIP demonstrated competitive gains despite their smaller size, suggesting feasibility for deployment in computing constrained clinical environments. Overall, these findings highlight the potential of ICL as a practical solution in oncology, particularly for rare cancers and resource-limited contexts where fine-tuning is infeasible and annotated data is difficult to obtain.

Authors: Asahi Miyazaki, Tsuyoshi Okita
Abstract: Masked image modeling is one of the most poplular objectives of training. Recently, the SparK model has been proposed with superior performance among self-supervised learning models. This paper proposes a new mask pattern for this SparK model, proposing it as the Mesh Mask-ed SparK model. We report the effect of the mask pattern used for image masking in pre-training on performance.

Title: Ultrasound Report Generation with Multimodal Large Language Models for Standardized Texts
Authors: Peixuan Ge, Tongkun Su, Faqin Lv, Baoliang Zhao, Peng Zhang, Chi Hong Wong, Liang Yao, Yu Sun, Zenan Wang, Pak Kin Wong, Ying Hu
Abstract: Ultrasound (US) report generation is a challenging task due to the variability of US images, operator dependence, and the need for standardized text. Unlike X-ray and CT, US imaging lacks consistent datasets, making automation difficult. In this study, we propose a unified framework for multi-organ and multilingual US report generation, integrating fragment-based multilingual training and leveraging the standardized nature of US reports. By aligning modular text fragments with diverse imaging data and curating a bilingual English-Chinese dataset, the method achieves consistent and clinically accurate text generation across organ sites and languages. Fine-tuning with selective unfreezing of the vision transformer (ViT) further improves text-image alignment. Compared to the previous state-of-the-art KMVE method, our approach achieves relative gains of about 2\% in BLEU scores, approximately 3\% in ROUGE-L, and about 15\% in CIDEr, while significantly reducing errors such as missing or incorrect content. By unifying multi-organ and multi-language report generation into a single, scalable framework, this work demonstrates strong potential for real-world clinical workflows.

Title: Total Variation-Based Image Decomposition and Denoising for Microscopy Images
Authors: Marco Corrias, Giada Franceschi, Michele Riva, Alberto Tampieri, Karin Föttinger, Ulrike Diebold, Thomas Pock, Cesare Franchini
Abstract: Experimentally acquired microscopy images are unavoidably affected by the presence of noise and other unwanted signals, which degrade their quality and might hide relevant features. With the recent increase in image acquisition rate, modern denoising and restoration solutions become necessary. This study focuses on image decomposition and denoising of microscopy images through a workflow based on total variation (TV), addressing images obtained from various microscopy techniques, including atomic force microscopy (AFM), scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), and scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Our approach consists in restoring an image by extracting its unwanted signal components and subtracting them from the raw one, or by denoising it. We evaluate the performance of TV-$L^1$, Huber-ROF, and TGV-$L^1$ in achieving this goal in distinct study cases. Huber-ROF proved to be the most flexible one, while TGV-$L^1$ is the most suitable for denoising. Our results suggest a wider applicability of this method in microscopy, restricted not only to STM, AFM, and SEM images. The Python code used for this study is publicly available as part of AiSurf. It is designed to be integrated into experimental workflows for image acquisition or can be used to denoise previously acquired images.

Title: Validation of Conformal Prediction in Cervical Atypia Classification
Authors: Misgina Tsighe Hagos, Antti Suutala, Dmitrii Bychkov, Hakan Kücükel, Joar von Bahr, Milda Poceviciute, Johan Lundin, Nina Linder, Claes Lundström
Abstract: Deep learning based cervical cancer classification can potentially increase access to screening in low-resource regions. However, deep learning models are often overconfident and do not reliably reflect diagnostic uncertainty. Moreover, they are typically optimized to generate maximum-likelihood predictions, which fail to convey uncertainty or ambiguity in their results. Such challenges can be addressed using conformal prediction, a model-agnostic framework for generating prediction sets that contain likely classes for trained deep-learning models. The size of these prediction sets indicates model uncertainty, contracting as model confidence increases. However, existing conformal prediction evaluation primarily focuses on whether the prediction set includes or covers the true class, often overlooking the presence of extraneous classes. We argue that prediction sets should be truthful and valuable to end users, ensuring that the listed likely classes align with human expectations rather than being overly relaxed and including false positives or unlikely classes. In this study, we comprehensively validate conformal prediction sets using expert annotation sets collected from multiple annotators. We evaluate three conformal prediction approaches applied to three deep-learning models trained for cervical atypia classification. Our expert annotation-based analysis reveals that conventional coverage-based evaluations overestimate performance and that current conformal prediction methods often produce prediction sets that are not well aligned with human labels. Additionally, we explore the capabilities of the conformal prediction methods in identifying ambiguous and out-of-distribution data.

Title: DeepCPD: Deep Learning Based In-Car Child Presence Detection Using WiFi
Authors: Sakila S. Jayaweera, Beibei Wang, Wei-Hsiang Wang, K. J. Ray Liu
Abstract: Child presence detection (CPD) is a vital technology for vehicles to prevent heat-related fatalities or injuries by detecting the presence of a child left unattended. Regulatory agencies around the world are planning to mandate CPD systems in the near future. However, existing solutions have limitations in terms of accuracy, coverage, and additional device requirements. While WiFi-based solutions can overcome the limitations, existing approaches struggle to reliably distinguish between adult and child presence, leading to frequent false alarms, and are often sensitive to environmental variations. In this paper, we present DeepCPD, a novel deep learning framework designed for accurate child presence detection in smart vehicles. DeepCPD utilizes an environment-independent feature-the auto-correlation function (ACF) derived from WiFi channel state information (CSI)-to capture human-related signatures while mitigating environmental distortions. A Transformer-based architecture, followed by a multilayer perceptron (MLP), is employed to differentiate adults from children by modeling motion patterns and subtle body size differences. To address the limited availability of in-vehicle child and adult data, we introduce a two-stage learning strategy that significantly enhances model generalization. Extensive experiments conducted across more than 25 car models and over 500 hours of data collection demonstrate that DeepCPD achieves an overall accuracy of 92.86%, outperforming a CNN baseline by a substantial margin (79.55%). Additionally, the model attains a 91.45% detection rate for children while maintaining a low false alarm rate of 6.14%.

Title: Tri-Hybrid Multi-User Precoding Using Pattern-Reconfigurable Antennas: Fundamental Models and Practical Algorithms
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Yuchen Zhang, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Anas Chaaban
Abstract: The integration of pattern-reconfigurable antennas into hybrid multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) architectures presents a promising path toward high-efficiency and low-cost transceiver solutions. Pattern-reconfigurable antennas can dynamically steer per-antenna radiation patterns, enabling more efficient power utilization and interference suppression. In this work, we study a tri-hybrid MIMO architecture for multi-user communication that integrates digital, analog, and antenna-domain precoding using pattern-reconfigurable antennas. For characterizing the reconfigurability of antenna radiation patterns, we develop two models -- Model~I and Model~II. Model~I captures realistic hardware constraints through limited pattern selection, while Model~II explores the performance upper bound by assuming arbitrary pattern generation. Based on these models, we develop two corresponding tri-hybrid precoding algorithms grounded in the weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) framework, which alternately optimize the digital, analog, and antenna precoders under practical per-antenna power constraints. Realistic simulations conducted in ray-tracing generated environments are utilized to evaluate the proposed system and algorithms. The results demonstrate the significant potential of the considered tri-hybrid architecture in enhancing communication performance and hardware efficiency. However, they also reveal that the existing hardware is not yet capable of fully realizing these performance gains, underscoring the need for joint progress in antenna design and communication theory development.

Title: Bandlimited signal reconstruction from orthogonally-projected data
Authors: Nguyen T. Thao, Marek Miskowicz
Abstract: We show that a broad class of signal acquisition schemes can be interpreted as recording data from a signal $x$ in a space $\cal U$ (typically, though not exclusively, a space of bandlimited functions) via an orthogonal projection $w = P_{\cal V} x$ onto another space $\cal V$. A basic reconstruction method in this case consists in alternating projections between the input space $\cal U$ and the affine space $\cal W$ of signals $u$ satisfying $P_{\cal V} u = w$ (POCS method). Although this method is classically known to be slow, our work reveals new insights and contributions: (i) it applies to new complex encoders emerging from event-based sampling, for which no faster reconstruction method is currently available; (ii) beyond perfect reconstruction, it converges robustly under insufficient (e.g., sub-Nyquist) or inconsistent data (due to noise or errors); (iii) the limit of convergence achieves optimal least-squares approximations under such conditions; (iv) semi-convergence inherently results in regularized reconstructions under ill-posed data acquisition conditions; (v) when $w$ is produced by discrete sampling, the iterative method can be rigorously discretized for DSP implementation -- even with non-separable input spaces $\cal U$. While moving beyond the traditional focus on perfect reconstruction in harmonic analysis, our analysis preserves the deterministic framework of infinite-dimensional Hilbert spaces, consistent with Shannon's sampling theory. For illustration, we apply our proposed theory to two contrasting sampling situations: multi-channel time encoding and nonuniform point sampling in a Sobolev space.

Title: To Stay or to Bypass: Unraveling Mainline Vehicles' Aggregate Strategic Decision-Making at Highway Weaving Ramps
Authors: Haohui He, Kexin Wang, Ruolin Li
Abstract: The weaving ramp scenario is a critical bottleneck in highway networks due to conflicting flows and complex interactions among merging, exiting, and through vehicles. In this work, we propose a game-theoretic model to capture and predict the aggregate lane choice behavior of mainline through vehicles as they approach the weaving zone. Faced with potential conflicts from merging and exiting vehicles, mainline vehicles can either bypass the conflict zone by changing to an adjacent lane or stay steadfast in their current lane. Our model effectively captures these strategic choices using a small set of parameters, requiring only limited traffic measurements for calibration. The model's validity is demonstrated through SUMO simulations, achieving high predictive accuracy. The simplicity and flexibility of the proposed framework make it a practical tool for analyzing bottleneck weaving scenarios and informing traffic management strategies.

Title: Resource Allocation with Multi-Team Collaboration Based on Hamilton's Rule
Authors: Riwa Karam, Ruoyu Lin, Brooks A. Butler, Magnus Egerstedt
Abstract: This paper presents a multi-team collaboration strategy based on Hamilton's rule from ecology that facilitates resource allocation among multiple teams, where agents are considered as shared resource among all teams that must be allocated appropriately. We construct an algorithmic framework that allows teams to make bids for agents that consider the costs and benefits of transferring agents while also considering relative mission importance for each team. This framework is applied to a multi-team coverage control mission to demonstrate its effectiveness. It is shown that the necessary criteria of a mission evaluation function are met by framing it as a function of the locational coverage cost of each team with respect to agent gain and loss, and these results are illustrated through simulations.

Title: Performance Analysis of Fluid Antenna System Aided OTFS Satellite Communications
Authors: Halvin Yang, Mahsa Derakhshani, Sangarapillai Lambotharan, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks typically rely on satellite communications to provide coverage in rural areas. However, high-mobility satellite links introduce severe Doppler and delay spreads, which necessitate the use of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation for reliable data transmission. Furthermore, the space and energy constraints on IoT devices make the perfect use case for fluid antenna systems (FAS) due to their mechanical simplicity. Hence, we propose a sophisticated FAS aided OTFS (FAS-OTFS) framework for satellite-based IoT networks. We derive analytical expressions for both the outage probability and ergodic capacity of FAS-OTFS under a general channel model, where the expressions derived are presented in integral form or as analytical bounds for efficient numerical evaluation. Additionally, we investigate a single-path fading scenario, where closed-form expressions are obtained. Our numerical results demonstrate significant performance gains in terms of both the outage probability and capacity compared to conventional OTFS systems, confirming the efficacy of FAS-OTFS in energy-constrained high-mobility environments. Our findings establish FAS-OTFS as a promising candidate for next-generation IoT communications over satellite links.

Title: Leveraging Offline Data from Similar Systems for Online Linear Quadratic Control
Authors: Shivam Bajaj, Prateek Jaiswal, Vijay Gupta
Abstract: ``Sim2real gap", in which the system learned in simulations is not the exact representation of the real system, can lead to loss of stability and performance when controllers learned using data from the simulated system are used on the real system. In this work, we address this challenge in the linear quadratic regulator (LQR) setting. Specifically, we consider an LQR problem for a system with unknown system matrices. Along with the state-action pairs from the system to be controlled, a trajectory of length $S$ of state-action pairs from a different unknown system is available. Our proposed algorithm is constructed upon Thompson sampling and utilizes the mean as well as the uncertainty of the dynamics of the system from which the trajectory of length $S$ is obtained. We establish that the algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({f(S,M_{\delta})\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret after $T$ time steps, where $M_{\delta}$ characterizes the \emph{dissimilarity} between the two systems and $f(S,M_{\delta})$ is a function of $S$ and $M_{\delta}$. When $M_{\delta}$ is sufficiently small, the proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}({\sqrt{T/S}})$ Bayes regret and outperforms a naive strategy which does not utilize the available trajectory.

Title: Mainlobe Jamming Suppression Using MIMO-STCA Radar
Authors: Huake Wang, Bairui Cai, Guisheng Liao
Abstract: Radar jamming suppression, particularly against mainlobe jamming, has become a critical focus in modern radar systems. This article investigates advanced mainlobe jamming suppression techniques utilizing a novel multiple-input multiple-output space-time coding array (MIMO-STCA) radar. Extending the capabilities of traditional MIMO radar, the MIMO-STCA framework introduces additional degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the range domain through the utilization of transmit time delays, offering enhanced resilience against interference. One of the key challenges in mainlobe jamming scenarios is the difficulty in obtaining interference-plus-noise samples that are free from target signal contamination. To address this, the study introduces a cumulative sampling-based non-homogeneous sample selection (CS-NHSS) algorithm to remove target-contaminated samples, ensuring accurate interference-plus-noise covariance matrix estimation and effective noise subspace separation. Building on this, the subsequent step is to apply the proposed noise subspace-based jamming mitigation (NSJM) algorithm, which leverages the orthogonality between noise and jamming subspace for effective jamming mitigation. However, NSJM performance can degrade due to spatial frequency mismatches caused by DoA or range quantization errors. To overcome this limitation, the study further proposes the robust jamming mitigation via noise subspace (RJNS) algorithm, incorporating adaptive beampattern control to achieve a flat-top mainlobe and broadened nulls, enhancing both anti-jamming effectiveness and robustness under non-ideal conditions. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. Significant improvements in mainlobe jamming suppression are demonstrated through transmit-receive beampattern analysis and enhanced signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) curve.

Title: Sensing-Assisted Channel Prediction in Complex Wireless Environments: An LLM-Based Approach
Authors: Junjie He, Zixiang Ren, Jianping Yao, Han Hu, Tony Xiao Han, Jie Xu
Abstract: This letter studies the sensing-assisted channel prediction for a multi-antenna orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system operating in realistic and complex wireless environments. In this system,an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) transmitter leverages the mono-static sensing capability to facilitate the prediction of its bi-static communication channel, by exploiting the fact that the sensing and communication channels share the same physical environment involving shared scatterers. Specifically, we propose a novel large language model (LLM)-based channel prediction approach,which adapts pre-trained text-based LLM to handle the complex-matrix-form channel state information (CSI) data. This approach utilizes the LLM's strong ability to capture the intricate spatiotemporal relationships between the multi-path sensing and communication channels, and thus efficiently predicts upcoming communication CSI based on historical communication and sensing CSI data. Experimental results show that the proposed LLM-based approach significantly outperforms conventional deep learning-based methods and the benchmark scheme without sensing assistance.

Title: Trellis Waveform Shaping for Sidelobe Reduction in Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Duality with PAPR Mitigation
Authors: Henglin Pu, Husheng Li, Zhu Han, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: A key challenge in integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is the synthesis of waveforms that can modulate communication messages and achieve good sensing performance simultaneously. In ISAC systems, standard communication waveforms can be adapted for sensing, as the sensing receiver (co-located with the transmitter) has knowledge of the communication message and consequently the waveform. However, the randomness of communications may result in waveforms that have high sidelobes masking weak targets. Thus, it is desirable to refine communication waveforms to improve the sensing performance by reducing the integrated sidelobe levels (ISL). This is similar to the peak-to-average power ratio (PAPR) mitigation in orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), in which the OFDM-modulated waveform needs to be refined to reduce the PAPR. In this paper, inspired by PAPR reduction algorithms in OFDM, we employ trellis shaping in OFDM-based ISAC systems to refine waveforms for specific sensing metrics using convolutional codes and Viterbi decoding. In such a scheme, the communication data is encoded and then mapped to the signaling constellation in different subcarriers, such that the time-domain sidelobes are reduced. An interesting observation is that sidelobe reduction in OFDM-based ISAC is dual to PAPR reduction in OFDM, thereby sharing a similar signaling structure. Numerical simulations and hardware software defined radio USRP experiments are carried out to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trellis shaping approach.

Title: BiECVC: Gated Diversification of Bidirectional Contexts for Learned Video Compression
Authors: Wei Jiang, Junru Li, Kai Zhang, Li Zhang
Abstract: Recent forward prediction-based learned video compression (LVC) methods have achieved impressive results, even surpassing VVC reference software VTM under the Low Delay B (LDB) configuration. In contrast, learned bidirectional video compression (BVC) remains underexplored and still lags behind its forward-only counterparts. This performance gap is mainly due to the limited ability to extract diverse and accurate contexts: most existing BVCs primarily exploit temporal motion while neglecting non-local correlations across frames. Moreover, they lack the adaptability to dynamically suppress harmful contexts arising from fast motion or occlusion. To tackle these challenges, we propose BiECVC, a BVC framework that incorporates diversified local and non-local context modeling along with adaptive context gating. For local context enhancement, BiECVC reuses high-quality features from lower layers and aligns them using decoded motion vectors without introducing extra motion this http URL model non-local dependencies efficiently, we adopt a linear attention mechanism that balances performance and complexity. To further mitigate the impact of inaccurate context prediction, we introduce Bidirectional Context Gating, inspired by data-dependent decay in recent autoregressive language models, to dynamically filter contextual information based on conditional coding results. Extensive experiments demonstrate that BiECVC achieves state-of-the-art performance, reducing the bit-rate by 13.4% and 15.7% compared to VTM 13.2 under the Random Access (RA) configuration with intra periods of 32 and 64, respectively. To our knowledge, BiECVC is the first learned video codec to surpass VTM 13.2 RA across all standard test datasets. Code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Optimum and Adaptive Complex-Valued Bilinear Filters
Authors: Bernhard Plaimer, Matthias Wagner, Oliver Lang, Mario Huemer
Abstract: The identification of nonlinear systems is a frequent task in digital signal processing. Such nonlinear systems may be grouped into many sub-classes, whereby numerous nonlinear real-world systems can be approximated as bilinear (BL) models. Therefore, various optimum and adaptive BL filters have been introduced in recent years. Further, in many applications such as communications and radar, complex-valued (CV) BL systems in combination with CV signals may occur. Hence, in this work, we investigate the extension of real-valued (RV) BL filters to CV BL filters. First, we derive CV BL filters by applying two or four RV BL filters, and compare them with respect to their computational complexity and performance. Second, we introduce novel fully CV BL filters, such as the CV BL Wiener filter (WF), the CV BL least squares (LS) filter, the CV BL least mean squares (LMS) filter, the CV BL normalized LMS (NLMS) filter, and the CV BL recursive least squares (RLS) filter. Finally, these filters are applied to identify multiple-input-single-output (MISO) systems and Hammerstein models.

Title: Data-driven Internal Model Control for Output Regulation
Authors: Wenjie Liu, Yifei Li, Jian Sun, Gang Wang, Keyou You, Lihua Xie, Jie Chen
Abstract: Output regulation is a fundamental problem in control theory, extensively studied since the 1970s. Traditionally, research has primarily addressed scenarios where the system model is explicitly known, leaving the problem in the absence of a system model less explored. Leveraging the recent advancements in Willems et al.'s fundamental lemma, data-driven control has emerged as a powerful tool for stabilizing unknown systems. This paper tackles the output regulation problem for unknown single and multi-agent systems (MASs) using noisy data. Previous approaches have attempted to solve data-based output regulation equations (OREs), which are inadequate for achieving zero tracking error with noisy data. To circumvent the need for solving data-based OREs, we propose an internal model-based data-driven controller that reformulates the output regulation problem into a stabilization problem. This method is first applied to linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, demonstrating exact solution capabilities, i.e., zero tracking error, through solving a straightforward data-based linear matrix inequality (LMI). Furthermore, we extend our approach to solve the $k$th-order output regulation problem for nonlinear systems. Extensions to both linear and nonlinear MASs are discussed. Finally, numerical tests validate the effectiveness and correctness of the proposed controllers.

Title: Q-space Guided Collaborative Attention Translation Network for Flexible Diffusion-Weighted Images Synthesis
Authors: Pengli Zhu, Yingji Fu, Nanguang Chen, Anqi Qiu
Abstract: This study, we propose a novel Q-space Guided Collaborative Attention Translation Networks (Q-CATN) for multi-shell, high-angular resolution DWI (MS-HARDI) synthesis from flexible q-space sampling, leveraging the commonly acquired structural MRI data. Q-CATN employs a collaborative attention mechanism to effectively extract complementary information from multiple modalities and dynamically adjust its internal representations based on flexible q-space information, eliminating the need for fixed sampling schemes. Additionally, we introduce a range of task-specific constraints to preserve anatomical fidelity in DWI, enabling Q-CATN to accurately learn the intrinsic relationships between directional DWI signal distributions and q-space. Extensive experiments on the Human Connectome Project (HCP) dataset demonstrate that Q-CATN outperforms existing methods, including 1D-qDL, 2D-qDL, MESC-SD, and QGAN, in estimating parameter maps and fiber tracts both quantitatively and qualitatively, while preserving fine-grained details. Notably, its ability to accommodate flexible q-space sampling highlights its potential as a promising toolkit for clinical and research applications. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: DCSNet: A Lightweight Knowledge Distillation-Based Model with Explainable AI for Lung Cancer Diagnosis from Histopathological Images
Authors: Sadman Sakib Alif, Nasim Anzum Promise, Fiaz Al Abid, Aniqua Nusrat Zereen
Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths globally, where early detection and accurate diagnosis are critical for improving survival rates. While deep learning, particularly convolutional neural networks (CNNs), has revolutionized medical image analysis by detecting subtle patterns indicative of early-stage lung cancer, its adoption faces challenges. These models are often computationally expensive and require significant resources, making them unsuitable for resource constrained environments. Additionally, their lack of transparency hinders trust and broader adoption in sensitive fields like healthcare. Knowledge distillation addresses these challenges by transferring knowledge from large, complex models (teachers) to smaller, lightweight models (students). We propose a knowledge distillation-based approach for lung cancer detection, incorporating explainable AI (XAI) techniques to enhance model transparency. Eight CNNs, including ResNet50, EfficientNetB0, EfficientNetB3, and VGG16, are evaluated as teacher models. We developed and trained a lightweight student model, Distilled Custom Student Network (DCSNet) using ResNet50 as the teacher. This approach not only ensures high diagnostic performance in resource-constrained settings but also addresses transparency concerns, facilitating the adoption of AI-driven diagnostic tools in healthcare.

Title: Coordinated Multi-Valve Disturbance-Rejection Pressure Control for High-Altitude Test Stands via Exterior Penalty Functions
Authors: Zhang Louyue, Li Xin, Zhai Chao, Shi Duoqi, Zhang Hehong, Dan Zhihong, Wang Xi, Liu Jiashuai, Xiao Gaoxi
Abstract: High altitude simulation test benches for aero engines employ multi chamber, multi valve intake systems that demand effective decoupling and strong disturbance rejection during transient tests. This paper proposes a coordinated active disturbance rejection control (ADRC) scheme based on an external penalty function. The chamber pressure safety limit is reformulated as an inequality constrained optimization problem, and an exponential penalty together with a gradient based algorithm is designed for dynamic constraint relaxation, with global convergence rigorously proven. A coordination term is then integrated into a distributed ADRC framework to yield a multi valve coordinated LADRC controller, whose asymptotic stability is established via Lyapunov theory. Hardware in the loop simulations using MATLAB/Simulink and a PLC demonstrate that, under $\pm$3 kPa pressure constraints, chamber V2's maximum error is 1.782 kPa (77.1\% lower than PID control), and under a 180 kg/s^2 flow rate disturbance, valve oscillations decrease from $\pm$27\% to $\pm$5\% (an 81.5\% reduction). These results confirm the proposed method's superior disturbance rejection and decoupling performance.

Title: Empirical Study on Near-Field and Spatial Non-Stationarity Modeling for THz XL-MIMO Channel in Indoor Scenario
Authors: Huixin Xu, Jianhua Zhang, Pan Tang, Hongbo Xing, Chong Han, Lei Tian, Qixing Wang, Guangyi Liu
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) is considered a key enabling technology for 6G and beyond due to its advantages such as wide bandwidth and high beam gain. As the frequency and array size increase, users are more likely to fall within the near-field (NF) region, where the far-field plane-wave assumption no longer holds. This also introduces spatial non-stationarity (SnS), as different antenna elements observe distinct multipath characteristics. Therefore, this paper proposes a THz XL-MIMO channel model that accounts for both NF propagation and SnS, validated using channel measurement data. In this work, we first conduct THz XL-MIMO channel measurements at 100 GHz and 132 GHz using 301- and 531-element ULAs in indoor environments, revealing pronounced NF effects characterized by nonlinear inter-element phase variations, as well as element-dependent delay and angle shifts. Moreover, the SnS phenomenon is observed, arising not only from blockage but also from inconsistent reflection or scattering. Based on these observations, a hybrid NF channel modeling approach combining the scatterer-excited point-source model and the specular reflection model is proposed to capture nonlinear phase variation. For SnS modeling, amplitude attenuation factors (AAFs) are introduced to characterize the continuous variation of path power across the array. By analyzing the statistical distribution and spatial autocorrelation properties of AAFs, a statistical rank-matching-based method is proposed for their generation. Finally, the model is validated using measured data. Evaluation across metrics such as entropy capacity, condition number, spatial correlation, channel gain, Rician K-factor, and RMS delay spread confirms that the proposed model closely aligns with measurements and effectively characterizes the essential features of THz XL-MIMO channels.

Title: Omni-R1: Do You Really Need Audio to Fine-Tune Your Audio LLM?
Authors: Andrew Rouditchenko, Saurabhchand Bhati, Edson Araujo, Samuel Thomas, Hilde Kuehne, Rogerio Feris, James Glass
Abstract: We propose Omni-R1 which fine-tunes a recent multi-modal LLM, Qwen2.5-Omni, on an audio question answering dataset with the reinforcement learning method GRPO. This leads to new State-of-the-Art performance on the recent MMAU benchmark. Omni-R1 achieves the highest accuracies on the sounds, music, speech, and overall average categories, both on the Test-mini and Test-full splits. To understand the performance improvement, we tested models both with and without audio and found that much of the performance improvement from GRPO could be attributed to better text-based reasoning. We also made a surprising discovery that fine-tuning without audio on a text-only dataset was effective at improving the audio-based performance.

Title: Wearable Tracking of Eye and Body Movements During Breaching Training: Towards Real-Time Blast Injury Monitoring
Authors: Jeremy P. Kemmerer, James R. Williamson, Joseph Kim, Elizabeth Halford, Hrishikesh M. Rao, Christopher J. Smalt
Abstract: Repeated exposure to blast overpressure in occupational settings has been associated with changes in cognitive and psychological health, as well as deficits in neurosensory subsystems. In this work, we describe a wearable system to simultaneously monitor physiology and blast exposure levels and demonstrate how this system can identify individualized exposure levels corresponding to acute physiological response to blast exposure. Machine learning was used to develop a dose-response model that fused multiple physiological measures (electrooculuography, gait, and balance) into a single risk score by predicting the level of blast exposure on held-out subjects (Fused model, R = 0.60). We found that blast events with peak pressure levels as low as 0.25 psi could be related to physiological changes and hence may contribute to blast injury. We also identified an individual subject with deteriorating reaction time scores that consistently showed a rapid and anomalous change in physiology-based risk scores after exposure to low-level blast events. Our results suggest that the wearable approach to blast monitoring is viable in weapons training environments as a complement to more direct but sparsely administered brain health assessments, potentially viable in austere environments, and that fusing multiple physiological signals can improve sensitivity.

Title: Regulation without calibration
Authors: Rodolphe Sepulchre, Alessandro Cecconi, Michelangelo Bin, Lorenzo Marconi
Abstract: This article revisits the importance of the internal model principle in the literature of regulation and synchronization. Trajectory regulation, the task of regulating continuous-time signals generated by differential equations, is contrasted with event regulation, the task of only regulating discrete events associated with the trajectories. In trajectory regulation, the internal model principle requires an exact internal generator of the continuous-time trajectories, which translates into unrealistic calibration requirements. Event regulation is envisioned as a way to relieve calibration of the continuous behavior while ensuring reliability of the discrete events.

Title: Spec2VolCAMU-Net: A Spectrogram-to-Volume Model for EEG-to-fMRI Reconstruction based on Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder and Vision-Mamba U-Net
Authors: Dongyi He, Shiyang Li, Bin Jiang, He Yan
Abstract: High-resolution functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) is essential for mapping human brain activity; however, it remains costly and logistically challenging. If comparable volumes could be generated directly from widely available scalp electroencephalography (EEG), advanced neuroimaging would become significantly more accessible. Existing EEG-to-fMRI generators rely on plain CNNs that fail to capture cross-channel time-frequency cues or on heavy transformer/GAN decoders that strain memory and stability. We propose Spec2VolCAMU-Net, a lightweight spectrogram-to-volume generator that confronts these issues via a Multi-directional Time-Frequency Convolutional Attention Encoder, stacking temporal, spectral and joint convolutions with self-attention, and a Vision-Mamba U-Net decoder whose linear-time state-space blocks enable efficient long-range spatial modelling. Trained end-to-end with a hybrid SSI-MSE loss, Spec2VolCAMU-Net achieves state-of-the-art fidelity on three public benchmarks, recording SSIMs of 0.693 on NODDI, 0.725 on Oddball and 0.788 on CN-EPFL, representing improvements of 14.5%, 14.9%, and 16.9% respectively over previous best SSIM scores. Furthermore, it achieves competitive PSNR scores, particularly excelling on the CN-EPFL dataset with a 4.6% improvement over the previous best PSNR, thus striking a better balance in reconstruction quality. The proposed model is lightweight and efficient, making it suitable for real-time applications in clinical and research settings. The code is available at this https URL.

Authors: Shengpeng Ji, Tianle Liang, Yangzhuo Li, Jialong Zuo, Minghui Fang, Jinzheng He, Yifu Chen, Zhengqing Liu, Ziyue Jiang, Xize Cheng, Siqi Zheng, Jin Xu, Junyang Lin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: End-to-end spoken dialogue models such as GPT-4o-audio have recently garnered significant attention in the speech domain. However, the evaluation of spoken dialogue models' conversational performance has largely been overlooked. This is primarily due to the intelligent chatbots convey a wealth of non-textual information which cannot be easily measured using text-based language models like ChatGPT. To address this gap, we propose WavReward, a reward feedback model based on audio language models that can evaluate both the IQ and EQ of spoken dialogue systems with speech input. Specifically, 1) based on audio language models, WavReward incorporates the deep reasoning process and the nonlinear reward mechanism for post-training. By utilizing multi-sample feedback via the reinforcement learning algorithm, we construct a specialized evaluator tailored to spoken dialogue models. 2) We introduce ChatReward-30K, a preference dataset used to train WavReward. ChatReward-30K includes both comprehension and generation aspects of spoken dialogue models. These scenarios span various tasks, such as text-based chats, nine acoustic attributes of instruction chats, and implicit chats. WavReward outperforms previous state-of-the-art evaluation models across multiple spoken dialogue scenarios, achieving a substantial improvement about Qwen2.5-Omni in objective accuracy from 55.1$\%$ to 91.5$\%$. In subjective A/B testing, WavReward also leads by a margin of 83$\%$. Comprehensive ablation studies confirm the necessity of each component of WavReward. All data and code will be publicly at this https URL after the paper is accepted.

Title: Meta-learning Slice-to-Volume Reconstruction in Fetal Brain MRI using Implicit Neural Representations
Authors: Maik Dannecker, Thomas Sanchez, Meritxell Bach Cuadra, Özgün Turgut, Anthony N. Price, Lucilio Cordero-Grande, Vanessa Kyriakopoulou, Joseph V. Hajnal, Daniel Rueckert
Abstract: High-resolution slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR) from multiple motion-corrupted low-resolution 2D slices constitutes a critical step in image-based diagnostics of moving subjects, such as fetal brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI). Existing solutions struggle with image artifacts and severe subject motion or require slice pre-alignment to achieve satisfying reconstruction performance. We propose a novel SVR method to enable fast and accurate MRI reconstruction even in cases of severe image and motion corruption. Our approach performs motion correction, outlier handling, and super-resolution reconstruction with all operations being entirely based on implicit neural representations. The model can be initialized with task-specific priors through fully self-supervised meta-learning on either simulated or real-world data. In extensive experiments including over 480 reconstructions of simulated and clinical MRI brain data from different centers, we prove the utility of our method in cases of severe subject motion and image artifacts. Our results demonstrate improvements in reconstruction quality, especially in the presence of severe motion, compared to state-of-the-art methods, and up to 50% reduction in reconstruction time.

Title: On Properties of Phase-Conjugation Focusing for Large Intelligent Surface Applications -- Part II: Horizontal Polarization
Authors: Jiawang Li
Abstract: Near-field focusing (NFF) forms the basis for several applications of large intelligent surface (LIS) in sub-10 GHz bands, including wireless communications, wireless power transfer, positioning, and sensing. In this two-part paper, Part I analyzed the properties of phase conjugation NFF for vertically polarized antennas, in a circular array configuration. In Part II of this article, we continue to study phase conjugation NFF for circular arrays, but for horizontally polarized antennas. We investigate the focusing characteristics of a circular array in two distinct configurations. The numerical results show that the first configuration where all the antenna elements (including the user antenna) are aligned offers significant better performance in terms of peak gain, 3 dB focal width and sidelobe level, relative to the second configuration where the broadside of the elements faces the array center. This result points to the beneficial use of orthogonally oriented horizontally polarized antenna at the user to allow for flexible polarization alignment with the fixed array orientation. In addition, the vertical polarized circular array of Part I may be merged with the first configuration of Part II to provide optimal NFF to a randomly oriented user equipment with a polarization reconfigurable tripole antenna.

Title: On Properties of Phase-Conjugation Focusing for Large Intelligent Surface Applications -- Part I: Vertical Polarization
Authors: Jiawang Li
Abstract: Large intelligent surface (LIS) is one promising path to leverage 6G performance in sub-10 GHz bands. This two-part paper explores the properties of phase-conjugation focusing for a simplified LIS setup with a two-dimensional (2D) circular antenna array and a user antenna located within the array aperture in the same plane. In Part I of this article, we assume vertical polarization for all antenna elements, whereas Part II assumes horizontal polarization. In Part I, we focus on the effect of array radius on the peak gain, 3 dB focusing width, and sidelobes for two types of circular arrays. The numerical results show that the gain minimum is located at the array center. The peak gain varies by less than 0.5 dB for focal points located within 2 from the array center. Similarly, the focal width and sidelobe level are also stable within this region, irrespective of array radius. From 2 from the center to the array edge, the closer proximity of the focal points to some array elements than other elements results in more drastic changes in these NFF properties. Finally, full-wave simulation using Ansys HFSS is used to partially validate the numerical results.

Title: OptiGait-LGBM: An Efficient Approach of Gait-based Person Re-identification in Non-Overlapping Regions
Authors: Md. Sakib Hassan Chowdhury, Md. Hafiz Ahamed, Bishowjit Paul, Sarafat Hussain Abhi, Abu Bakar Siddique, Md. Robius Sany
Abstract: Gait recognition, known for its ability to identify individuals from a distance, has gained significant attention in recent times due to its non-intrusive verification. While video-based gait identification systems perform well on large public datasets, their performance drops when applied to real-world, unconstrained gait data due to various factors. Among these, uncontrolled outdoor environments, non-overlapping camera views, varying illumination, and computational efficiency are core challenges in gait-based authentication. Currently, no dataset addresses all these challenges simultaneously. In this paper, we propose an OptiGait-LGBM model capable of recognizing person re-identification under these constraints using a skeletal model approach, which helps mitigate inconsistencies in a person's appearance. The model constructs a dataset from landmark positions, minimizing memory usage by using non-sequential data. A benchmark dataset, RUET-GAIT, is introduced to represent uncontrolled gait sequences in complex outdoor environments. The process involves extracting skeletal joint landmarks, generating numerical datasets, and developing an OptiGait-LGBM gait classification model. Our aim is to address the aforementioned challenges with minimal computational cost compared to existing methods. A comparative analysis with ensemble techniques such as Random Forest and CatBoost demonstrates that the proposed approach outperforms them in terms of accuracy, memory usage, and training time. This method provides a novel, low-cost, and memory-efficient video-based gait recognition solution for real-world scenarios.

Title: Range conditions on distributions and their possible application to geometric calibration in 2D parallel and fan-beam geometries
Authors: Anastasia Konik, Laurent Desbat
Abstract: In tomography, range conditions or data consistency conditions (DCCs) on functions have proven useful for geometric self-calibration, which involves identifying geometric parameters of acquisition systems based only on acquired radiographic images. These self-calibration methods using range conditions on functions typically require non-truncated data. In this work, we derive range conditions on distributions and demonstrate their application in addressing data truncation issues during the calibration process. We propose a novel approach based on range conditions on distributions, employing Dirac distributions to model markers within the field-of-view of an X-ray system. Our calibration methods are based on the local geometric information from non-truncated projections of a marker set. By applying range conditions to projections of sums of Dirac distributions, combined with specific calibration marker sets, we derive analytical formulas that enable the identification of geometric calibration parameters. We aim to present DCCs on distributions in tomography and explore the potential of DCCs on distributions as a possible tool in calibration. This approach represents one possible application, demonstrating how DCCs on distributions can effectively address challenges such as data truncation and incomplete marker set information. We present results for the 2D parallel geometry (Radon transform) and the 2D fan-beam geometry with sources on a line.

Title: Intelligent Road Anomaly Detection with Real-time Notification System for Enhanced Road Safety
Authors: Ali Almakhluk, Uthman Baroudi, Yasser El-Alfy
Abstract: This study aims to improve transportation safety, especially traffic safety. Road damage anomalies such as potholes and cracks have emerged as a significant and recurring cause for accidents. To tackle this problem and improve road safety, a comprehensive system has been developed to detect potholes, cracks (e.g. alligator, transverse, longitudinal), classify their sizes, and transmit this data to the cloud for appropriate action by authorities. The system also broadcasts warning signals to nearby vehicles warning them if a severe anomaly is detected on the road. Moreover, the system can count road anomalies in real-time. It is emulated through the utilization of Raspberry Pi, a camera module, deep learning model, laptop, and cloud service. Deploying this innovative solution aims to proactively enhance road safety by notifying relevant authorities and drivers about the presence of potholes and cracks to take actions, thereby mitigating potential accidents arising from this prevalent road hazard leading to safer road conditions for the whole community.

Title: Multi-step manipulation task and motion planning guided by video demonstration
Authors: Kateryna Zorina, David Kovar, Mederic Fourmy, Florent Lamiraux, Nicolas Mansard, Justin Carpentier, Josef Sivic, Vladimir Petrik
Abstract: This work aims to leverage instructional video to solve complex multi-step task-and-motion planning tasks in robotics. Towards this goal, we propose an extension of the well-established Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RRT) planner, which simultaneously grows multiple trees around grasp and release states extracted from the guiding video. Our key novelty lies in combining contact states and 3D object poses extracted from the guiding video with a traditional planning algorithm that allows us to solve tasks with sequential dependencies, for example, if an object needs to be placed at a specific location to be grasped later. We also investigate the generalization capabilities of our approach to go beyond the scene depicted in the instructional video. To demonstrate the benefits of the proposed video-guided planning approach, we design a new benchmark with three challenging tasks: (I) 3D re-arrangement of multiple objects between a table and a shelf, (ii) multi-step transfer of an object through a tunnel, and (iii) transferring objects using a tray similar to a waiter transfers dishes. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning algorithm on several robots, including the Franka Emika Panda and the KUKA KMR iiwa. For a seamless transfer of the obtained plans to the real robot, we develop a trajectory refinement approach formulated as an optimal control problem (OCP).

Title: SaFARi: State-Space Models for Frame-Agnostic Representation
Authors: Hossein Babaei, Mel White, Sina Alemohammad, Richard G. Baraniuk
Abstract: State-Space Models (SSMs) have re-emerged as a powerful tool for online function approximation, and as the backbone of machine learning models for long-range dependent data. However, to date, only a few polynomial bases have been explored for this purpose, and the state-of-the-art implementations were built upon the best of a few limited options. In this paper, we present a generalized method for building an SSM with any frame or basis, rather than being restricted to polynomials. This framework encompasses the approach known as HiPPO, but also permits an infinite diversity of other possible "species" within the SSM architecture. We dub this approach SaFARi: SSMs for Frame-Agnostic Representation.

Abstract: We revisit the privacy-utility tradeoff of x-vector speaker anonymization. Existing approaches quantify privacy through training complex speaker verification or identification models that are later used as attacks. Instead, we propose a novel inference attack for de-anonymization. Our attack is simple and ML-free yet we show experimentally that it outperforms existing approaches.

Title: Model-free Online Learning for the Kalman Filter: Forgetting Factor and Logarithmic Regret
Authors: Jiachen Qian, Yang Zheng
Abstract: We consider the problem of online prediction for an unknown, non-explosive linear stochastic system. With a known system model, the optimal predictor is the celebrated Kalman filter. In the case of unknown systems, existing approaches based on recursive least squares and its variants may suffer from degraded performance due to the highly imbalanced nature of the regression model. This imbalance can easily lead to overfitting and thus degrade prediction accuracy. We tackle this problem by injecting an inductive bias into the regression model via {exponential forgetting}. While exponential forgetting is a common wisdom in online learning, it is typically used for re-weighting data. In contrast, our approach focuses on balancing the regression model. This achieves a better trade-off between {regression} and {regularization errors}, and simultaneously reduces the {accumulation error}. With new proof techniques, we also provide a sharper logarithmic regret bound of $O(\log^3 N)$, where $N$ is the number of observations.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning for Power Grid Multi-Stage Cascading Failure Mitigation
Authors: Bo Meng, Chenghao Xu, Yongli Zhu
Abstract: Cascading failures in power grids can lead to grid collapse, causing severe disruptions to social operations and economic activities. In certain cases, multi-stage cascading failures can occur. However, existing cascading-failure-mitigation strategies are usually single-stage-based, overlooking the complexity of the multi-stage scenario. This paper treats the multi-stage cascading failure problem as a reinforcement learning task and develops a simulation environment. The reinforcement learning agent is then trained via the deterministic policy gradient algorithm to achieve continuous actions. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated on the IEEE 14-bus and IEEE 118-bus systems.

Title: Aging-Aware Battery Control via Convex Optimization
Authors: Obidike Nnorom Jr., Giray Ogut, Stephen Boyd, Philip Levis
Abstract: We consider the task of controlling a battery while balancing two competing objectives that evolve over different time scales. The short-term objective, such as arbitrage or load smoothing, improves with more battery cycling, while the long-term objective is to maximize battery lifetime, which discourages cycling. Using a semi-empirical aging model, we formulate this problem as a convex optimization problem. We use model predictive control (MPC) with a convex approximation of aging dynamics to optimally manage the trade-off between performance and degradation. Through simulations, we quantify this trade-off in both economic and smoothing applications.

Title: Reach-Avoid-Stabilize Using Admissible Control Sets
Authors: Zheng Gong, Boyang Li, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: Hamilton-Jacobi Reachability (HJR) analysis has been successfully used in many robotics and control tasks, and is especially effective in computing reach-avoid sets and control laws that enable an agent to reach a goal while satisfying state constraints. However, the original HJR formulation provides no guarantees of safety after a) the prescribed time horizon, or b) goal satisfaction. The reach-avoid-stabilize (RAS) problem has therefore gained a lot of focus: find the set of initial states (the RAS set), such that the trajectory can reach the target, and stabilize to some point of interest (POI) while avoiding obstacles. Solving RAS problems using HJR usually requires defining a new value function, whose zero sub-level set is the RAS set. The existing methods do not consider the problem when there are a series of targets to reach and/or obstacles to avoid. We propose a method that uses the idea of admissible control sets; we guarantee that the system will reach each target while avoiding obstacles as prescribed by the given time series. Moreover, we guarantee that the trajectory ultimately stabilizes to the POI. The proposed method provides an under-approximation of the RAS set, guaranteeing safety. Numerical examples are provided to validate the theory.

Title: Solving Reach- and Stabilize-Avoid Problems Using Discounted Reachability
Authors: Boyang Li, Zheng Gong, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: In this article, we consider the infinite-horizon reach-avoid (RA) and stabilize-avoid (SA) zero-sum game problems for general nonlinear continuous-time systems, where the goal is to find the set of states that can be controlled to reach or stabilize to a target set, without violating constraints even under the worst-case disturbance. Based on the Hamilton-Jacobi reachability method, we address the RA problem by designing a new Lipschitz continuous RA value function, whose zero sublevel set exactly characterizes the RA set. We establish that the associated Bellman backup operator is contractive and that the RA value function is the unique viscosity solution of a Hamilton-Jacobi variational inequality. Finally, we develop a two-step framework for the SA problem by integrating our RA strategies with a recently proposed Robust Control Lyapunov-Value Function, thereby ensuring both target reachability and long-term stability. We numerically verify our RA and SA frameworks on a 3D Dubins car system to demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed approach.

Title: AdaFortiTran: An Adaptive Transformer Model for Robust OFDM Channel Estimation
Authors: Berkay Guler, Hamid Jafarkhani
Abstract: Deep learning models for channel estimation in Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) systems often suffer from performance degradation under fast-fading channels and low-SNR scenarios. To address these limitations, we introduce the Adaptive Fortified Transformer (AdaFortiTran), a novel model specifically designed to enhance channel estimation in challenging environments. Our approach employs convolutional layers that exploit locality bias to capture strong correlations between neighboring channel elements, combined with a transformer encoder that applies the global Attention mechanism to channel patches. This approach effectively models both long-range dependencies and spectro-temporal interactions within single OFDM frames. We further augment the model's adaptability by integrating nonlinear representations of available channel statistics SNR, delay spread, and Doppler shift as priors. A residual connection is employed to merge global features from the transformer with local features from early convolutional processing, followed by final convolutional layers to refine the hierarchical channel representation. Despite its compact architecture, AdaFortiTran achieves up to 6 dB reduction in mean squared error (MSE) compared to state-of-the-art models. Tested across a wide range of Doppler shifts (200-1000 Hz), SNRs (0 to 25 dB), and delay spreads (50-300 ns), it demonstrates superior robustness in high-mobility environments.

Title: DPN-GAN: Inducing Periodic Activations in Generative Adversarial Networks for High-Fidelity Audio Synthesis
Authors: Zeeshan Ahmad, Shudi Bao, Meng Chen
Abstract: In recent years, generative adversarial networks (GANs) have made significant progress in generating audio sequences. However, these models typically rely on bandwidth-limited mel-spectrograms, which constrain the resolution of generated audio sequences, and lead to mode collapse during conditional generation. To address this issue, we propose Deformable Periodic Network based GAN (DPN-GAN), a novel GAN architecture that incorporates a kernel-based periodic ReLU activation function to induce periodic bias in audio generation. This innovative approach enhances the model's ability to capture and reproduce intricate audio patterns. In particular, our proposed model features a DPN module for multi-resolution generation utilizing deformable convolution operations, allowing for adaptive receptive fields that improve the quality and fidelity of the synthetic audio. Additionally, we enhance the discriminator network using deformable convolution to better distinguish between real and generated samples, further refining the audio quality. We trained two versions of the model: DPN-GAN small (38.67M parameters) and DPN-GAN large (124M parameters). For evaluation, we use five different datasets, covering both speech synthesis and music generation tasks, to demonstrate the efficiency of the DPN-GAN. The experimental results demonstrate that DPN-GAN delivers superior performance on both out-of-distribution and noisy data, showcasing its robustness and adaptability. Trained across various datasets, DPN-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art GAN architectures on standard evaluation metrics, and exhibits increased robustness in synthesized audio.

Title: Model Identification Adaptive Control with $ρ$-POMDP Planning
Authors: Michelle Ho, Arec Jamgochian, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Abstract: Accurate system modeling is crucial for safe, effective control, as misidentification can lead to accumulated errors, especially under partial observability. We address this problem by formulating informative input design (IID) and model identification adaptive control (MIAC) as belief space planning problems, modeled as partially observable Markov decision processes with belief-dependent rewards ($\rho$-POMDPs). We treat system parameters as hidden state variables that must be localized while simultaneously controlling the system. We solve this problem with an adapted belief-space iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (BiLQR). We demonstrate it on fully and partially observable tasks for cart-pole and steady aircraft flight domains. Our method outperforms baselines such as regression, filtering, and local optimal control methods, even under instantaneous disturbances to system parameters.

Title: Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface Using Error-State Kalman Filter and Receding Horizon Model Predictive Control
Authors: Yimou Wu, Mingyang Liang, Ruoyu Xu
Abstract: Recovering a drone on a disturbed water surface remains a significant challenge in maritime robotics. In this paper, we propose a unified framework for Robot-Assisted Drone Recovery on a Wavy Surface that addresses two major tasks: Firstly, accurate prediction of a moving drone's position under wave-induced disturbances using an Error-State Kalman Filter (ESKF), and secondly, effective motion planning for a manipulator via Receding Horizon Control (RHC). Specifically, the ESKF predicts the drone's future position 0.5s ahead, while the manipulator plans a capture trajectory in real time, thus overcoming not only wave-induced base motions but also limited torque constraints. We provide a system design that comprises a manipulator subsystem and a UAV subsystem. On the UAV side, we detail how position control and suspended payload strategies are implemented. On the manipulator side, we show how an RHC scheme outperforms traditional low-level control algorithms. Simulation and real-world experiments - using wave-disturbed motion data - demonstrate that our approach achieves a high success rate - above 95% and outperforms conventional baseline methods by up to 10% in efficiency and 20% in precision. The results underscore the feasibility and robustness of our system, which achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance and offers a practical solution for maritime drone operations.

Title: A Multi-Task Foundation Model for Wireless Channel Representation Using Contrastive and Masked Autoencoder Learning
Authors: Berkay Guler, Giovanni Geraci, Hamid Jafarkhani
Abstract: Current applications of self-supervised learning to wireless channel representation often borrow paradigms developed for text and image processing, without fully addressing the unique characteristics and constraints of wireless communications. Aiming to fill this gap, we first propose WiMAE (Wireless Masked Autoencoder), a transformer-based encoder-decoder foundation model pretrained on a realistic open-source multi-antenna wireless channel dataset. Building upon this foundation, we develop ContraWiMAE, which enhances WiMAE by incorporating a contrastive learning objective alongside the reconstruction task in a unified multi-task framework. By warm-starting from pretrained WiMAE weights and generating positive pairs via noise injection, the contrastive component enables the model to capture both structural and discriminative features, enhancing representation quality beyond what reconstruction alone can achieve. Through extensive evaluation on unseen scenarios, we demonstrate the effectiveness of both approaches across multiple downstream tasks, with ContraWiMAE showing further improvements in linear separability and adaptability in diverse wireless environments. Comparative evaluations against a state-of-the-art wireless channel foundation model confirm the superior performance and data efficiency of our models, highlighting their potential as powerful baselines for future research in self-supervised wireless channel representation learning.

Title: Theoretical and Experimental Assessment of Large Beam Codebook at mmWave Devices: How Much is Enough?
Authors: Bora Bozkurt, Hasan Atalay Gunel, Mohaned Chraiti, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ali Gorcin, Ali Ghrayeb
Abstract: Modern millimeter wave (mmWave) transceivers come with a large number of antennas, each of which can support thousands of phase shifter configurations. This capability enables beam sweeping with fine angular resolution, but results in large codebook sizes that can span more than six orders of magnitude. On the other hand, the mobility of user terminals and their randomly changing orientations require constantly adjusting the beam direction. A key focus of recent research has been on the design of beam sweeping codebooks that balance a trade-off between the achievable gain and the beam search time, governed by the codebook size. In this paper, we investigate the extent to which a large codebook can be reduced to fewer steering vectors while covering the entire angular space and maintaining performance close to the maximum array gain. We derive a closed-form expression for the angular coverage range of a steering vector, subject to maintaining a gain loss within \(\gamma\) dB (e.g., 2\, dB) with respect to the maximum gain achieved by an infinitely large codebook. We demonstrate, both theoretically and experimentally, that a large beam-steering codebooks (such as the \(1024^{16}\) set considered in our experiment) can be reduced to just a few steering vectors. This framework serves as a proof that only a few steering vectors are sufficient to achieve near-maximum gain, challenging the common belief that a large codebook with fine angular resolution is essential to fully reap the benefits of an antenna array.

Title: Automated SAR ADC Sizing Using Analytical Equations
Authors: Zhongyi Li, Zhuofu Tao, Yanze Zhou, Yichen Shi, Zhiping Yu, Ting-Jung Lin, Lei He
Abstract: Conventional analog and mixed-signal (AMS) circuit designs heavily rely on manual effort, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. This paper presents a fully automated design methodology for Successive Approximation Register (SAR) Analog-to-Digital Converters (ADCs) from performance specifications to complete transistor sizing. To tackle the high-dimensional sizing problem, we propose a dual optimization scheme. The system-level optimization iteratively partitions the overall requirements and analytically maps them to subcircuit design specifications, while local optimization loops determines the subcircuits' design parameters. The dependency graph-based framework serializes the simulations for verification, knowledge-based calculations, and transistor sizing optimization in topological order, which eliminates the need for human intervention. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed methodology through two case studies with varying performance specifications, achieving high SNDR and low power consumption while meeting all the specified design constraints.

Title: Generalizing imaging biomarker repeatability studies using Bayesian inference: Applications in detecting heterogeneous treatment response in whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI of metastatic prostate cancer
Authors: Matthew D Blackledge, Konstantinos Zormpas-Petridis, Ricardo Donners, Antonio Candito, David J Collins, Johann de Bono, Chris Parker, Dow-Mu Koh, Nina Tunariu
Abstract: The assessment of imaging biomarkers is critical for advancing precision medicine and improving disease characterization. Despite the availability of methods to derive disease heterogeneity metrics in imaging studies, a robust framework for evaluating measurement uncertainty remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, we propose a novel Bayesian framework to assess the precision of disease heterogeneity measures in biomarker studies. Our approach extends traditional methods for evaluating biomarker precision by providing greater flexibility in statistical assumptions and enabling the analysis of biomarkers beyond univariate or multivariate normally-distributed variables. Using Hamiltonian Monte Carlo sampling, the framework supports both, for example, normally-distributed and Dirichlet-Multinomial distributed variables, enabling the derivation of posterior distributions for biomarker parameters under diverse model assumptions. Designed to be broadly applicable across various imaging modalities and biomarker types, the framework builds a foundation for generalizing reproducible and objective biomarker evaluation. To demonstrate utility, we apply the framework to whole-body diffusion-weighted MRI (WBDWI) to assess heterogeneous therapeutic responses in metastatic bone disease. Specifically, we analyze data from two patient studies investigating treatments for metastatic castrate-resistant prostate cancer (mCRPC). Our results reveal an approximately 70% response rate among individual tumors across both studies, objectively characterizing differential responses to systemic therapies and validating the clinical relevance of the proposed methodology. This Bayesian framework provides a powerful tool for advancing biomarker research across diverse imaging-based studies while offering valuable insights into specific clinical applications, such as mCRPC treatment response.

Title: Adaptive Noise Resilient Keyword Spotting Using One-Shot Learning
Authors: Luciano Sebastian Martinez-Rau, Quynh Nguyen Phuong Vu, Yuxuan Zhang, Bengt Oelmann, Sebastian Bader
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is a key component of smart devices, enabling efficient and intuitive audio interaction. However, standard KWS systems deployed on embedded devices often suffer performance degradation under real-world operating conditions. Resilient KWS systems address this issue by enabling dynamic adaptation, with applications such as adding or replacing keywords, adjusting to specific users, and improving noise robustness. However, deploying resilient, standalone KWS systems with low latency on resource-constrained devices remains challenging due to limited memory and computational resources. This study proposes a low computational approach for continuous noise adaptation of pretrained neural networks used for KWS classification, requiring only 1-shot learning and one epoch. The proposed method was assessed using two pretrained models and three real-world noise sources at signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) ranging from 24 to -3 dB. The adapted models consistently outperformed the pretrained models across all scenarios, especially at SNR $\leq$ 18 dB, achieving accuracy improvements of 4.9% to 46.0%. These results highlight the efficacy of the proposed methodology while being lightweight enough for deployment on resource-constrained devices.

Title: Neural Video Compression using 2D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Lakshya Gupta, Imran N. Junejo
Abstract: The computer vision and image processing research community has been involved in standardizing video data communications for the past many decades, leading to standards such as AVC, HEVC, VVC, AV1, AV2, etc. However, recent groundbreaking works have focused on employing deep learning-based techniques to replace the traditional video codec pipeline to a greater affect. Neural video codecs (NVC) create an end-to-end ML-based solution that does not rely on any handcrafted features (motion or edge-based) and have the ability to learn content-aware compression strategies, offering better adaptability and higher compression efficiency than traditional methods. This holds a great potential not only for hardware design, but also for various video streaming platforms and applications, especially video conferencing applications such as MS-Teams or Zoom that have found extensive usage in classrooms and workplaces. However, their high computational demands currently limit their use in real-time applications like video conferencing. To address this, we propose a region-of-interest (ROI) based neural video compression model that leverages 2D Gaussian Splatting. Unlike traditional codecs, 2D Gaussian Splatting is capable of real-time decoding and can be optimized using fewer data points, requiring only thousands of Gaussians for decent quality outputs as opposed to millions in 3D scenes. In this work, we designed a video pipeline that speeds up the encoding time of the previous Gaussian splatting-based image codec by 88% by using a content-aware initialization strategy paired with a novel Gaussian inter-frame redundancy-reduction mechanism, enabling Gaussian splatting to be used for a video-codec solution, the first of its kind solution in this neural video codec space.

Title: SingNet: Towards a Large-Scale, Diverse, and In-the-Wild Singing Voice Dataset
Authors: Yicheng Gu, Chaoren Wang, Junan Zhang, Xueyao Zhang, Zihao Fang, Haorui He, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: The lack of a publicly-available large-scale and diverse dataset has long been a significant bottleneck for singing voice applications like Singing Voice Synthesis (SVS) and Singing Voice Conversion (SVC). To tackle this problem, we present SingNet, an extensive, diverse, and in-the-wild singing voice dataset. Specifically, we propose a data processing pipeline to extract ready-to-use training data from sample packs and songs on the internet, forming 3000 hours of singing voices in various languages and styles. Furthermore, to facilitate the use and demonstrate the effectiveness of SingNet, we pre-train and open-source various state-of-the-art (SOTA) models on Wav2vec2, BigVGAN, and NSF-HiFiGAN based on our collected singing voice data. We also conduct benchmark experiments on Automatic Lyric Transcription (ALT), Neural Vocoder, and Singing Voice Conversion (SVC). Audio demos are available at: this https URL.

Abstract: The rapid advancement of neuroscience and machine learning has established data-driven stochastic dynamical system modeling as a powerful tool for understanding and controlling high-dimensional, spatio-temporal processes. We introduce the stochastic next-generation reservoir computing (NG-RC) controller, a framework that integrates the computational efficiency of NG-RC with stochastic analysis to enable robust event-triggered control in multiscale stochastic systems. The asymptotic stability of the controller is rigorously proven via an extended stochastic LaSalle theorem, providing theoretical guarantees for amplitude regulation in nonlinear stochastic dynamics. Numerical experiments on a stochastic Van-der-Pol system subject to both additive and multiplicative noise validate the algorithm, demonstrating its convergence rate across varying temporal scales and noise intensities. To bridge theoretical insights with real-world applications, we deploy the controller to modulate pathological dynamics reconstructed from epileptic EEG data. This work advances a theoretically guaranteed scalable framework for adaptive control of stochastic systems, with broad potential for data-driven decision making in engineering, neuroscience, and beyond.

Title: Improved Corner Cutting Constraints for Mixed-Integer Motion Planning of a Differential Drive Micro-Mobility Vehicle
Authors: Angelo Caregnato-Neto, Janito Vaqueiro Ferreira
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of motion planning for differential drive micro-mobility platforms. This class of vehicle is designed to perform small-distance transportation of passengers and goods in structured environments. Our approach leverages mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) to compute global optimal collision-free trajectories taking into account the kinematics and dynamics of the vehicle. We propose novel constraints for intersample collision avoidance and demonstrate its effectiveness using pick-up and delivery missions and statistical analysis of Monte Carlo simulations. The results show that the novel formulation provides the best trajectories in terms of time expenditure and control effort when compared to two state-of-the-art approaches.

Title: The Voice Timbre Attribute Detection 2025 Challenge Evaluation Plan
Authors: Zhengyan Sheng, Jinghao He, Liping Chen, Kong Aik Lee, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Voice timbre refers to the unique quality or character of a person's voice that distinguishes it from others as perceived by human hearing. The Voice Timbre Attribute Detection (VtaD) 2025 challenge focuses on explaining the voice timbre attribute in a comparative manner. In this challenge, the human impression of voice timbre is verbalized with a set of sensory descriptors, including bright, coarse, soft, magnetic, and so on. The timbre is explained from the comparison between two voices in their intensity within a specific descriptor dimension. The VtaD 2025 challenge starts in May and culminates in a special proposal at the NCMMSC2025 conference in October 2025 in Zhenjiang, China.

Title: Efficient LiDAR Reflectance Compression via Scanning Serialization
Authors: Jiahao Zhu, Kang You, Dandan Ding, Zhan Ma
Abstract: Reflectance attributes in LiDAR point clouds provide essential information for downstream tasks but remain underexplored in neural compression methods. To address this, we introduce SerLiC, a serialization-based neural compression framework to fully exploit the intrinsic characteristics of LiDAR reflectance. SerLiC first transforms 3D LiDAR point clouds into 1D sequences via scan-order serialization, offering a device-centric perspective for reflectance analysis. Each point is then tokenized into a contextual representation comprising its sensor scanning index, radial distance, and prior reflectance, for effective dependencies exploration. For efficient sequential modeling, Mamba is incorporated with a dual parallelization scheme, enabling simultaneous autoregressive dependency capture and fast processing. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SerLiC attains over 2x volume reduction against the original reflectance data, outperforming the state-of-the-art method by up to 22% reduction of compressed bits while using only 2% of its parameters. Moreover, a lightweight version of SerLiC achieves > 10 fps (frames per second) with just 111K parameters, which is attractive for real-world applications.

Title: Decentralized Nonlinear Model Predictive Control-Based Flock Navigation with Real-Time Obstacle Avoidance in Unknown Obstructed Environments
Authors: Nuthasith Gerdpratoom, Kaoru Yamamoto
Abstract: This work extends our prior work on the distributed nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) for navigating a robot fleet following a certain flocking behavior in unknown obstructed environments with a more realistic local obstacle avoidance strategy. More specifically, we integrate the local obstacle avoidance constraint using point clouds into the NMPC framework. Here, each agent relies on data from its local sensor to perceive and respond to nearby obstacles. A point cloud processing technique is presented for both two-dimensional and three-dimensional point clouds to minimize the computational burden during the optimization. The process consists of directional filtering and down-sampling that significantly reduce the number of data points. The algorithm's performance is validated through realistic 3D simulations in Gazebo, and its practical feasibility is further explored via hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) simulations on embedded platforms.

Title: Design of a Formation Control System to Assist Human Operators in Flying a Swarm of Robotic Blimps
Authors: Tianfu Wu, Jiaqi Fu, Wugang Meng, Sungjin Cho, Huanzhe Zhan, Fumin Zhang
Abstract: Formation control is essential for swarm robotics, enabling coordinated behavior in complex environments. In this paper, we introduce a novel formation control system for an indoor blimp swarm using a specialized leader-follower approach enhanced with a dynamic leader-switching mechanism. This strategy allows any blimp to take on the leader role, distributing maneuvering demands across the swarm and enhancing overall formation stability. Only the leader blimp is manually controlled by a human operator, while follower blimps use onboard monocular cameras and a laser altimeter for relative position and altitude estimation. A leader-switching scheme is proposed to assist the human operator to maintain stability of the swarm, especially when a sharp turn is performed. Experimental results confirm that the leader-switching mechanism effectively maintains stable formations and adapts to dynamic indoor environments while assisting human operator.

Title: Contactless Cardiac Pulse Monitoring Using Event Cameras
Authors: Mohamed Moustafa, Joseph Lemley, Peter Corcoran
Abstract: Time event cameras are a novel technology for recording scene information at extremely low latency and with low power consumption. Event cameras output a stream of events that encapsulate pixel-level light intensity changes within the scene, capturing information with a higher dynamic range and temporal resolution than traditional cameras. This study investigates the contact-free reconstruction of an individual's cardiac pulse signal from time event recording of their face using a supervised convolutional neural network (CNN) model. An end-to-end model is trained to extract the cardiac signal from a two-dimensional representation of the event stream, with model performance evaluated based on the accuracy of the calculated heart rate. The experimental results confirm that physiological cardiac information in the facial region is effectively preserved within the event stream, showcasing the potential of this novel sensor for remote heart rate monitoring. The model trained on event frames achieves a root mean square error (RMSE) of 3.32 beats per minute (bpm) compared to the RMSE of 2.92 bpm achieved by the baseline model trained on standard camera frames. Furthermore, models trained on event frames generated at 60 and 120 FPS outperformed the 30 FPS standard camera results, achieving an RMSE of 2.54 and 2.13 bpm, respectively.

Title: UWAV: Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-Visual Video Parsing
Authors: Yung-Hsuan Lai, Janek Ebbers, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, François Germain, Michael Jeffrey Jones, Moitreya Chatterjee
Abstract: Audio-Visual Video Parsing (AVVP) entails the challenging task of localizing both uni-modal events (i.e., those occurring exclusively in either the visual or acoustic modality of a video) and multi-modal events (i.e., those occurring in both modalities concurrently). Moreover, the prohibitive cost of annotating training data with the class labels of all these events, along with their start and end times, imposes constraints on the scalability of AVVP techniques unless they can be trained in a weakly-supervised setting, where only modality-agnostic, video-level labels are available in the training data. To this end, recently proposed approaches seek to generate segment-level pseudo-labels to better guide model training. However, the absence of inter-segment dependencies when generating these pseudo-labels and the general bias towards predicting labels that are absent in a segment limit their performance. This work proposes a novel approach towards overcoming these weaknesses called Uncertainty-weighted Weakly-supervised Audio-visual Video Parsing (UWAV). Additionally, our innovative approach factors in the uncertainty associated with these estimated pseudo-labels and incorporates a feature mixup based training regularization for improved training. Empirical results show that UWAV outperforms state-of-the-art methods for the AVVP task on multiple metrics, across two different datasets, attesting to its effectiveness and generalizability.

Title: Correct-by-construction requirement decomposition
Authors: Minghui Sun, Georgios Bakirtzis, Hassan Jafarzadeh, Cody Fleming
Abstract: In systems engineering, accurately decomposing requirements is crucial for creating well-defined and manageable system components, particularly in safety-critical domains. Despite the critical need, rigorous, top-down methodologies for effectively breaking down complex requirements into precise, actionable sub-requirements are scarce, especially compared to the wealth of bottom-up verification techniques. Addressing this gap, we introduce a formal decomposition for contract-based design that guarantees the correctness of decomposed requirements if specific conditions are met. Our (semi-)automated methodology augments contract-based design with reachability analysis and constraint programming to systematically identify, verify, and validate sub-requirements representable by continuous bounded sets -- continuous relations between real-valued inputs and outputs. We demonstrate the efficacy and practicality of a correct-by-construction approach through a comprehensive case study on a cruise control system, highlighting how our methodology improves the interpretability, tractability, and verifiability of system requirements.

Title: Error correcting 2D-3D cascaded network for myocardial infarct scar segmentation on late gadolinium enhancement cardiac magnetic resonance images
Authors: Matthias Schwab, Mathias Pamminger, Christian Kremser, Daniel Obmann, Markus Haltmeier, Agnes Mayr
Abstract: Late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is considered the in vivo reference standard for assessing infarct size (IS) and microvascular obstruction (MVO) in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) patients. However, the exact quantification of those markers of myocardial infarct severity remains challenging and very time-consuming. As LGE distribution patterns can be quite complex and hard to delineate from the blood pool or epicardial fat, automatic segmentation of LGE CMR images is challenging. In this work, we propose a cascaded framework of two-dimensional and three-dimensional convolutional neural networks (CNNs) which enables to calculate the extent of myocardial infarction in a fully automated way. By artificially generating segmentation errors which are characteristic for 2D CNNs during training of the cascaded framework we are enforcing the detection and correction of 2D segmentation errors and hence improve the segmentation accuracy of the entire method. The proposed method was trained and evaluated on two publicly available datasets. We perform comparative experiments where we show that our framework outperforms state-of-the-art reference methods in segmentation of myocardial infarction. Furthermore, in extensive ablation studies we show the advantages that come with the proposed error correcting cascaded method. The code of this project is publicly available at this https URL

Title: Iterative Occlusion-Aware Light Field Depth Estimation using 4D Geometrical Cues
Authors: Rui Lourenço, Lucas Thomaz, Eduardo A. B. Silva, Sergio M. M. Faria
Abstract: Light field cameras and multi-camera arrays have emerged as promising solutions for accurately estimating depth by passively capturing light information. This is possible because the 3D information of a scene is embedded in the 4D light field geometry. Commonly, depth estimation methods extract this information relying on gradient information, heuristic-based optimisation models, or learning-based approaches. This paper focuses mainly on explicitly understanding and exploiting 4D geometrical cues for light field depth estimation. Thus, a novel method is proposed, based on a non-learning-based optimisation approach for depth estimation that explicitly considers surface normal accuracy and occlusion regions by utilising a fully explainable 4D geometric model of the light field. The 4D model performs depth/disparity estimation by determining the orientations and analysing the intersections of key 2D planes in 4D space, which are the images of 3D-space points in the 4D light field. Experimental results show that the proposed method outperforms both learning-based and non-learning-based state-of-the-art methods in terms of surface normal angle accuracy, achieving a Median Angle Error on planar surfaces, on average, 26.3$\%$ lower than the state-of-the-art, and still being competitive with state-of-the-art methods in terms of MSE ${\times}$ 100 and Badpix 0.07.

Title: Using Few-Shot Learning to Classify Primary Lung Cancer and Other Malignancy with Lung Metastasis in Cytological Imaging via Endobronchial Ultrasound Procedures
Authors: Ching-Kai Lin, Di-Chun Wei, Yun-Chien Cheng
Abstract: This study presents a computer-aided diagnosis (CAD) system to assist early detection of lung metastases during endobronchial ultrasound (EBUS) procedures, significantly reducing follow-up time and enabling timely treatment. Due to limited cytology images and morphological similarities among cells, classifying lung metastases is challenging, and existing research rarely targets this issue this http URL overcome data scarcity and improve classification, the authors propose a few-shot learning model using a hybrid pretrained backbone with fine-grained classification and contrastive learning. Parameter-efficient fine-tuning on augmented support sets enhances generalization and transferability. The model achieved 49.59% accuracy, outperforming existing methods. With 20 image samples, accuracy improved to 55.48%, showing strong potential for identifying rare or novel cancer types in low-data clinical environments.

Title: Systematic interval observer design for linear systems
Authors: Thach Ngoc Dinh, Gia Quoc Bao Tran
Abstract: We first develop systematic and comprehensive interval observer designs for linear time-invariant (LTI) systems, under standard assumptions of observability and interval bounds on the initial condition and uncertainties. Traditionally, such designs rely on specific transformations into Metzler (in continuous time) or non-negative (in discrete time) forms, which may impose limitations. We demonstrate that these can be effectively replaced by an LTI transformation that is straightforward to compute offline. Subsequently, we extend the framework to time-varying systems, overcoming the limitations of conventional approaches that offer no guarantees. Our method utilizes dynamic transformations into higher-dimensional target systems, for which interval observers can always be constructed. These transformations become left-invertible after a finite time, provided the system is observable and the target dynamics are sufficiently high-dimensional and fast, thereby enabling the recovery of interval bounds in the original coordinates. Academic examples are provided to illustrate the proposed methodology.

Title: Resilient Random Time-hopping Reply against Distance Attacks in UWB Ranging
Authors: Wenlong Gou, Chuanhang Yu, Gang Wu
Abstract: In order to mitigate the distance reduction attack in Ultra-Wide Band (UWB) ranging, this paper proposes a secure ranging scheme based on a random time-hopping mechanism without redundant signaling overhead. Additionally, a secure ranging strategy is designed for backward compatibility with existing standards such as IEEE 802.15.4a/z, combined with an attack detection scheme. The effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed strategy are demonstrated through both simulation and experimental results in the case of the Ghost Peak attack, as demonstrated by Patrick Leu et al. The random time-hopping mechanism is verified to be capable of reducing the success rate of distance reduction attacks to less than 0.01%, thereby significantly enhancing the security of UWB ranging.

Title: On Using Curved Mirrors to Decrease Shadowing in VLC
Authors: Borja Genoves Guzman, Ana Garcia Armada, Maïté Brandt-Pearce
Abstract: Visible light communication (VLC) complements radio frequency in indoor environments with large wireless data traffic. However, VLC is hindered by dramatic path losses when an opaque object is interposed between the transmitter and the receiver. Prior works propose the use of plane mirrors as optical reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (ORISs) to enhance communications through non-line-of-sight links. Plane mirrors rely on their orientation to forward the light to the target user location, which is challenging to implement in practice. This paper studies the potential of curved mirrors as static reflective surfaces to provide a broadening specular reflection that increases the signal coverage in mirror-assisted VLC scenarios. We study the behavior of paraboloid and semi-spherical mirrors and derive the irradiance equations. We provide extensive numerical and analytical results and show that curved mirrors, when developed with proper dimensions, may reduce the shadowing probability to zero, while static plane mirrors of the same size have shadowing probabilities larger than 65%. Furthermore, the signal-to-noise ratio offered by curved mirrors may suffice to provide connectivity to users deployed in the room even when a line-of-sight link blockage occurs.

Title: A Deep Learning Approach for Pixel-level Material Classification via Hyperspectral Imaging
Authors: Savvas Sifnaios, George Arvanitakis, Fotios K. Konstantinidis, Georgios Tsimiklis, Angelos Amditis, Panayiotis Frangos
Abstract: Recent advancements in computer vision, particularly in detection, segmentation, and classification, have significantly impacted various domains. However, these advancements are tied to RGB-based systems, which are insufficient for applications in industries like waste sorting, pharmaceuticals, and defense, where advanced object characterization beyond shape or color is necessary. Hyperspectral (HS) imaging, capturing both spectral and spatial information, addresses these limitations and offers advantages over conventional technologies such as X-ray fluorescence and Raman spectroscopy, particularly in terms of speed, cost, and safety. This study evaluates the potential of combining HS imaging with deep learning for material characterization. The research involves: i) designing an experimental setup with HS camera, conveyor, and controlled lighting; ii) generating a multi-object dataset of various plastics (HDPE, PET, PP, PS) with semi-automated mask generation and Raman spectroscopy-based labeling; and iii) developing a deep learning model trained on HS images for pixel-level material classification. The model achieved 99.94\% classification accuracy, demonstrating robustness in color, size, and shape invariance, and effectively handling material overlap. Limitations, such as challenges with black objects, are also discussed. Extending computer vision beyond RGB to HS imaging proves feasible, overcoming major limitations of traditional methods and showing strong potential for future applications.

Authors: Richard Osuala, Smriti Joshi, Apostolia Tsirikoglou, Lidia Garrucho, Walter H.L. Pinaya, Daniel M. Lang, Julia A. Schnabel, Oliver Diaz, Karim Lekadir
Abstract: This paper presents a method for virtual contrast enhancement in breast MRI, offering a promising non-invasive alternative to traditional contrast agent-based DCE-MRI acquisition. Using a conditional generative adversarial network, we predict DCE-MRI images, including jointly-generated sequences of multiple corresponding DCE-MRI timepoints, from non-contrast-enhanced MRIs, enabling tumor localization and characterization without the associated health risks. Furthermore, we qualitatively and quantitatively evaluate the synthetic DCE-MRI images, proposing a multi-metric Scaled Aggregate Measure (SAMe), assessing their utility in a tumor segmentation downstream task, and conclude with an analysis of the temporal patterns in multi-sequence DCE-MRI generation. Our approach demonstrates promising results in generating realistic and useful DCE-MRI sequences, highlighting the potential of virtual contrast enhancement for improving breast cancer diagnosis and treatment, particularly for patients where contrast agent administration is contraindicated.

Title: Towards optimal algorithms for the recovery of low-dimensional models with linear rates
Authors: Yann Traonmilin (IMB), Jean François Aujol (IMB), Antoine Guennec (IMB)
Abstract: We consider the problem of recovering elements of a low-dimensional model from linear measurements. From signal and image processing to inverse problems in data science, this question has been at the center of many applications. Lately, with the success of models and methods relying on deep neural networks, there has been a multiplication of different algorithms and recovery results. Comparing the performance of recovery algorithms becomes a complex task without a unifying framework. In this article, as a first step for the study of general algorithms for low-dimensional recovery, we study a class of generalized projected gradient descent algorithms that can recover a given low-dimensional model with linear rates. The obtained rates decouple the impact of the quality of the measurements with respect to the model from the geometry of the properties of the chosen generalized projection: we can directly measure performance through a restricted Lipschitz constant of the projection with respect to the low dimensional model. By optimizing this constant, we define an optimal generalized projected gradient descent. Our general approach provides an optimality result in the case of sparse recovery. Moreover, our framework allows for a common interpretation of linear rates of recovery in the context of both sparse models and models induced by some ``plug-and-play'' imaging methods that rely on deep neural networks. These rates of recovery are observed in experiments on synthetic and real data.

Title: Noise-Aware Ensemble Learning for Efficient Radar Modulation Recognition
Authors: Do-Hyun Park, Min-Wook Jeon, Jinwoo Jeong, Isaac Sim, Sangbom Yun, Junghyun Seo, Hyoung-Nam Kim
Abstract: Electronic warfare support (ES) systems intercept adversary radar signals and estimate various types of signal information, including modulation schemes. The accurate and rapid identification of modulation schemes under conditions of very low signal power remains a significant challenge for ES systems. This paper proposes a recognition model based on a noise-aware ensemble learning (NAEL) framework to efficiently recognize radar modulation schemes in noisy environments. The NAEL framework evaluates the influence of noise on recognition and adaptively selects an appropriate neural network structure, offering significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and recognition performance. We present the analysis results of the recognition performance of the proposed model based on experimental data. Our recognition model demonstrates superior recognition accuracy with low computational complexity compared to conventional classification models.

Title: On Overlap Ratio in Defocused Electron Ptychography
Authors: Amirafshar Moshtaghpour, Angus I. Kirkland
Abstract: Four-dimensional Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy (4D STEM) with data acquired using a defocused electron probe is a promising tool for characterising complex biological specimens and materials through a phase retrieval process known as Electron Ptychography (EP). The efficacy of 4D STEM acquisition and the resulting quality of EP reconstruction depends on the overlap ratio of adjacent illuminated areas. This paper demonstrates how the overlap ratio impacts the data redundancy and the quality of the EP reconstruction. We define two quantities as a function of the overlap ratio that are independent of both the object and the EP algorithm. Subsequently, we evaluate an EP algorithm for varying overlap ratios using simulated 4D STEM datasets. Notably, a 40% or greater overlap ratio yields stable, high-quality reconstructions.

Title: Hybrid Resolver Model Generalization for Fault Condition Modeling: A Promising Tool for Reliability Study
Authors: MohammadSadegh KhajueeZadeh, Farid Tootoonchian, Ali Pourghoraba
Abstract: Resolvers, like all electromagnetic devices, are constantly under investigation, both operationally and structurally. In this regard, proposing a modeling methodology that can save significant time without compromising accuracy is a big honor. In this study, a generalized hybrid model is suggested that, in addition to the above benefits, has sufficient capability to ease reliability study in the field of resolvers, where a large number of faulty conditions must be investigated under different operating conditions, including changes in angular velocity, voltage, and frequency of excitation; all of which are highlighted in the context of fault coverage. This model also serves as a promising tool for generating large datasets, which is advantageous for fault diagnosis. A resolver with a non-uniform air gap is chosen as a case study to challenge the suggested model, particularly in relation to eccentricity faults. We generalize the suggested model to account for the most common faulty conditions of resolvers: in-turn short circuits in signal and excitation windings, as well as static and dynamic eccentricity faults. The close agreement between the results of the suggested model and those from Time-Stepping Finite Element Analysis (TS-FEA), along with significant time savings in both healthy and faulty conditions, highlights the generality and proficiency of the suggested model. Finally, the case study is prototyped, and we verify the accuracy of the suggested model experimentally.

Title: Feedback-Free Resource Scheduling for Flexible Multi-BS Cooperation in FD-RAN
Authors: Jingbo Liu, Jiacheng Chen, Zeyu Sun, Bo Qian, Haibo Zhou
Abstract: Flexible cooperation among base stations (BSs) is critical to improve resource utilization efficiency and meet personalized user demands. However, its practical implementation is hindered by the current radio access network (RAN), which relies on the coupling of uplink and downlink transmissions and channel state information feedback with inherent issues such as overheads and delays. To overcome these limitations, we consider the fully-decoupled RAN (FD-RAN), in which uplink and downlink functionalities are independent, and feedback-free MIMO transmission is adopted at the physical layer. To further deliver flexible cooperation in FD-RAN, we study feedback-free downlink multi-BS resource scheduling under the practical scheduling process. The problem is considered based on network load conditions. In heavy-load states where it is impossible for all user demands to be met, an optimal greedy algorithm is proposed, maximizing the weighted sum of user demand satisfaction rates. In light-load states where at least one solution exists to satisfy all user demands, an optimal two-stage resource allocation algorithm is designed to further minimize network energy consumption by leveraging the flexibility of cooperation. Extensive simulations validate the superiority of proposed algorithms in performance and running time, and highlight the potential for realizing flexible cooperation in practice.

Title: On the Connection Between Magnetic-Field Odometry Aided Inertial Navigation and Magnetic-Field SLAM
Authors: Isaac Skog, Manon Kok, Gustaf Hendeby, Chuan Huang, Thomas Edridge
Abstract: Magnetic-field simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) using consumer-grade inertial and magnetometer sensors offers a scalable, cost-effective solution for indoor localization. However, the rapid error accumulation in the inertial navigation process limits the feasible exploratory phases of these systems. Advances in magnetometer array processing have demonstrated that odometry information, i.e., displacement and rotation information, can be extracted from local magnetic field variations and used to create magnetic-field odometry-aided inertial navigation systems. The error growth rate of these systems is significantly lower than that of standalone inertial navigation systems. This study seeks an answer to whether a magnetic-field SLAM system fed with measurements from a magnetometer array can indirectly extract odometry information -- without requiring algorithmic modifications -- and thus sustain longer exploratory phases. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that such a system can extract odometry information and indirectly create a magnetic field odometry-aided inertial navigation system during the exploration phases. However, practical challenges related to map resolution and computational complexity remain significant.

Title: Data-Driven Calibration Technique for Quantitative Radar Imaging
Authors: Zacharie Idriss, Raghu Raj
Abstract: Quantitative inversion algorithms allow for the reconstruction of electrical properties (such as permittivity, and conductivity) for every point in a scene. However, they are challenging to use on measured datasets due to the need to know the incident wave field in the scene. In general, this is unknown due to factors such as antenna characteristics, path loss, waveform factors, etc. In this paper, we introduce a scalar calibration factor to account for these factors. To solve for the calibration factor, we augment the inversion procedure by including the forward problem, which we solve by training a simple feed-forward fully connected neural network to learn a mapping between the underlying permittivity distribution and the scattered field at the radar. We then minimize the mismatch between the measured and simulated fields to optimize the scalar calibration factor for each transmitter. We use the Fresnel Institute dataset to test our algorithm.

Title: Kernel-based error bounds of bilinear Koopman surrogate models for nonlinear data-driven control
Authors: Robin Strässer, Manuel Schaller, Julian Berberich, Karl Worthmann, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: We derive novel deterministic bounds on the approximation error of data-based bilinear surrogate models for unknown nonlinear systems. The surrogate models are constructed using kernel-based extended dynamic mode decomposition to approximate the Koopman operator in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. Unlike previous methods that require restrictive assumptions on the invariance of the dictionary, our approach leverages kernel-based dictionaries that allow us to control the projection error via pointwise error bounds, overcoming a significant limitation of existing theoretical guarantees. The derived state- and input-dependent error bounds allow for direct integration into Koopman-based robust controller designs with closed-loop guarantees for the unknown nonlinear system. Numerical examples illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Title: A Spectrum-based Filter Design for Periodic Control of Systems with Time Delay
Authors: Can Kutlu Yüksel, Tomáš Vyhlídal, Jaroslav Bušek, Martin Hromčík, Silviu-Iulian Niculescu
Abstract: A fully analytical controller design is proposed to tackle a periodic control problem for stable linear systems with an input delay. Applying the internal model control scheme, the controller design reduces to designing a filter, which is done through the placement of poles and zeros. The zeros are placed to compensate for the harmonics and to achieve the desired degree of properness for the filter. For placing the poles, a quasi-optimal procedure is proposed utilizing the standard LQR method. Given the high-dimensionality of the filter due to targeting a large number of harmonics, the design, as well as controller implementation, is performed over a state-space representation. A thorough experimental case study is included to demonstrate both the practical feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed control design. The experimental validation is performed on a physical system, the goal of which is to reject periodic vibrations acting on a mass-spring-damper setup where the sensor and the actuator are non-collocated.

Title: Gradient Attention Map Based Verification of Deep Convolutional Neural Networks with Application to X-ray Image Datasets
Authors: Omid Halimi Milani, Amanda Nikho, Lauren Mills, Marouane Tliba, Ahmet Enis Cetin, Mohammed H. Elnagar
Abstract: Deep learning models have great potential in medical imaging, including orthodontics and skeletal maturity assessment. However, applying a model to data different from its training set can lead to unreliable predictions that may impact patient care. To address this, we propose a comprehensive verification framework that evaluates model suitability through multiple complementary strategies. First, we introduce a Gradient Attention Map (GAM)-based approach that analyzes attention patterns using Grad-CAM and compares them via similarity metrics such as IoU, Dice Similarity, SSIM, Cosine Similarity, Pearson Correlation, KL Divergence, and Wasserstein Distance. Second, we extend verification to early convolutional feature maps, capturing structural mis-alignments missed by attention alone. Finally, we incorporate an additional garbage class into the classification model to explicitly reject out-of-distribution inputs. Experimental results demonstrate that these combined methods effectively identify unsuitable models and inputs, promoting safer and more reliable deployment of deep learning in medical imaging.

Title: Easz: An Agile Transformer-based Image Compression Framework for Resource-constrained IoTs
Authors: Yu Mao, Jingzong Li, Jun Wang, Hong Xu, Tei-Wei Kuo, Nan Guan, Chun Jason Xue
Abstract: Neural image compression, necessary in various machine-to-machine communication scenarios, suffers from its heavy encode-decode structures and inflexibility in switching between different compression levels. Consequently, it raises significant challenges in applying the neural image compression to edge devices that are developed for powerful servers with high computational and storage capacities. We take a step to solve the challenges by proposing a new transformer-based edge-compute-free image coding framework called Easz. Easz shifts the computational overhead to the server, and hence avoids the heavy encoding and model switching overhead on the edge. Easz utilizes a patch-erase algorithm to selectively remove image contents using a conditional uniform-based sampler. The erased pixels are reconstructed on the receiver side through a transformer-based framework. To further reduce the computational overhead on the receiver, we then introduce a lightweight transformer-based reconstruction structure to reduce the reconstruction load on the receiver side. Extensive evaluations conducted on a real-world testbed demonstrate multiple advantages of Easz over existing compression approaches, in terms of adaptability to different compression levels, computational efficiency, and image reconstruction quality.

Title: Interval reduced-order switched positive observers for uncertain switched positive linear systems
Authors: Naohisa Otsuka, Daiki Kakehi, Przemysław Ignaciuk
Abstract: In this paper, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order switched positive observers for continuous- and discrete-time switched positive linear systems with uncertainty are established. In the analyzed class, arbitrary switching is permitted, whereas the uncertainty expressed via matrix inequalities concerns both the initial state and system parameters. Positive lower and positive upper interval switched observers are obtained. The proposed observers are of (n - p) order, where n is the dimension of the state vector and p is the rank of the output matrix, i.e., p-dimensional measurement information. Moreover, as a special case, existence conditions and a design procedure of reduced-order positive observers for uncertain positive linear systems without switching are provided. The theoretical findings are illustrated by two numerical examples for continuous- and discrete-time systems.

Title: Performance Analysis of Cooperative Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks
Authors: Dongsheng Sui, Cunhua Pan, Hong Ren, Jiahua Wan, Liuchang Zhuo, Jing Jin, Qixing Wang, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this work, we aim to effectively characterize the performance of cooperative integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks and to reveal how performance metrics relate to network parameters. To this end, we introduce a generalized stochastic geometry framework to model the cooperative ISAC networks, which approximates the spatial randomness of the network deployment. Based on this framework, we derive analytical expressions for key performance metrics in both communication and sensing domains, with a particular focus on communication coverage probability and radar information rate. The analytical expressions derived explicitly highlight how performance metrics depend on network parameters, thereby offering valuable insights into the deployment and design of cooperative ISAC networks. In the end, we validate the theoretical performance analysis through Monte Carlo simulation results. Our results demonstrate that increasing the number of cooperative base stations (BSs) significantly improves both metrics, while increasing the BS deployment density has a limited impact on communication coverage probability but substantially enhances the radar information rate. Additionally, increasing the number of transmit antennas is effective when the total number of transmit antennas is relatively small. The incremental performance gain reduces with the increase of the number of transmit antennas, suggesting that indiscriminately increasing antennas is not an efficient strategy to improve the performance of the system in cooperative ISAC networks.

Abstract: Granite-speech LLMs are compact and efficient speech language models specifically designed for English ASR and automatic speech translation (AST). The models were trained by modality aligning the 2B and 8B parameter variants of granite-3.3-instruct to speech on publicly available open-source corpora containing audio inputs and text targets consisting of either human transcripts for ASR or automatically generated translations for AST. Comprehensive benchmarking shows that on English ASR, which was our primary focus, they outperform several competitors' models that were trained on orders of magnitude more proprietary data, and they keep pace on English-to-X AST for major European languages, Japanese, and Chinese. The speech-specific components are: a conformer acoustic encoder using block attention and self-conditioning trained with connectionist temporal classification, a windowed query-transformer speech modality adapter used to do temporal downsampling of the acoustic embeddings and map them to the LLM text embedding space, and LoRA adapters to further fine-tune the text LLM. Granite-speech-3.3 operates in two modes: in speech mode, it performs ASR and AST by activating the encoder, projector, and LoRA adapters; in text mode, it calls the underlying granite-3.3-instruct model directly (without LoRA), essentially preserving all the text LLM capabilities and safety. Both models are freely available on HuggingFace (this https URL and this https URL) and can be used for both research and commercial purposes under a permissive Apache 2.0 license.

Title: Guaranteed Rejection-free Sampling Method Using Past Behaviours for Motion Planning of Autonomous Systems
Authors: Thomas T. Enevoldsen, Roberto Galeazzi
Abstract: The paper presents a novel learning-based sampling strategy that guarantees rejection-free sampling of the free space under both biased and approximately uniform conditions, leveraging multivariate kernel densities. Historical data from a given autonomous system is leveraged to estimate a non-parametric probabilistic description of the domain, which also describes the free space where feasible solutions of the motion planning problem are likely to be found. The tuning parameters of the kernel density estimator, the bandwidth and the kernel, are used to alter the description of the free space so that no samples can fall outside the originally defined this http URL proposed method is demonstrated in two real-life case studies: An autonomous surface vessel (2D) and an autonomous drone (3D). Two planning problems are solved, showing that the proposed approximately uniform sampling scheme is capable of guaranteeing rejection-free samples of the considered workspace. Furthermore, the effectiveness of the proposed method is statistically validated using Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Flexible single multimode fiber imaging using white LED
Authors: Minyu Fan, Kun Liu, Jie Zhu, Yu Cao, Sha Wang
Abstract: Multimode fiber (MMF) has been proven to have good potential in imaging and optical communication because of its advantages of small diameter and large mode numbers. However, due to the mode coupling and modal dispersion, it is very sensitive to environmental changes. Minor changes in the fiber shape can lead to difficulties in information reconstruction. Here, white LED and cascaded Unet are used to achieve MMF imaging to eliminate the effect of fiber perturbations. The output speckle patterns in three different color channels of the CCD camera produced by transferring images through the MMF are concatenated and inputted into the cascaded Unet using channel stitching technology to improve the reconstruction effects. The average Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the reconstructed images from the Fashion-MINIST dataset is 0.83. In order to check the flexibility of such a system, perturbation tests on the image reconstruction capability by changing the fiber shapes are conducted. The experimental results show that the MMF imaging system has good robustness properties, i. e. the average PCC remains 0.83 even after completely changing the shape of the MMF. This research potentially provides a flexible approach for the practical application of MMF imaging.

Title: Joint Antenna Position and Beamforming Optimization with Self-Interference Mitigation in MA-ISAC System
Authors: Size Peng, Cixiao Zhang, Yin Xu, Qingqing Wu, Lipeng Zhu, Xiaowu Ou, Dazhi He
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have demonstrated significant potential in enhancing the performance of integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, the application in the integrated and cost-effective full-duplex (FD) monostatic systems remains underexplored. To address this research gap, we develop an MA-ISAC model within a monostatic framework, where the self-interference channel is modeled in the near field and characterized by antenna position vectors. This model allows us to investigate the use of MAs with the goal of maximizing the weighted sum of communication capacity and sensing mutual information. The resulting optimization problem is non-convex making it challenging to solve optimally. To overcome this, we employ fractional programming (FP) to propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm that jointly optimizes the beamforming and antenna positions for both transceivers. Specifically, closed-form solutions for the transmit and receive beamforming matrices are derived using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions, and a novel coarse-to-fine grained search (CFGS) approach is employed to determine the high-quality sub-optimal antenna positions. Numerical results demonstrate that with strong self-interference cancellation (SIC) capabilities, MAs significantly enhance the overall performance and reliability of the ISAC system when utilizing our proposed algorithm, compared to conventional fixed-position antenna designs.

Title: Is Linear Feedback on Smoothed Dynamics Sufficient for Stabilizing Contact-Rich Plans?
Authors: Yuki Shirai, Tong Zhao, H.J. Terry Suh, Huaijiang Zhu, Xinpei Ni, Jiuguang Wang, Max Simchowitz, Tao Pang
Abstract: Designing planners and controllers for contact-rich manipulation is extremely challenging as contact violates the smoothness conditions that many gradient-based controller synthesis tools assume. Contact smoothing approximates a non-smooth system with a smooth one, allowing one to use these synthesis tools more effectively. However, applying classical control synthesis methods to smoothed contact dynamics remains relatively under-explored. This paper analyzes the efficacy of linear controller synthesis using differential simulators based on contact smoothing. We introduce natural baselines for leveraging contact smoothing to compute (a) open-loop plans robust to uncertain conditions and/or dynamics, and (b) feedback gains to stabilize around open-loop plans. Using robotic bimanual whole-body manipulation as a testbed, we perform extensive empirical experiments on over 300 trajectories and analyze why LQR seems insufficient for stabilizing contact-rich plans.

Title: Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN): A Unified Time-Frequency Approach for ECG Classification
Authors: Sam Jeong, Hae Yong Kim
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized biomedical signal analysis, particularly in electrocardiogram (ECG) classification. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) excel at automatic feature extraction, the optimal integration of time- and frequency-domain information remains unresolved. This study introduces the Convolutional Fourier Analysis Network (CFAN), a novel architecture that unifies time-frequency analysis by embedding Fourier principles directly into CNN layers. We evaluate CFAN against four benchmarks - spectrogram-based 2D CNN (SPECT); 1D CNN (CNN1D); Fourier-based 1D CNN (FFT1D); and CNN1D with integrated Fourier Analysis Network (CNN1D-FAN) - across three ECG tasks: arrhythmia classification (MIT-BIH), identity recognition (ECG-ID), and apnea detection (Apnea-ECG). CFAN achieved state-of-the-art performance, surpassing all competing methods with accuracies of 98.95% (MIT-BIH), 96.83% (ECG-ID), and 95.01% (Apnea-ECG). Notably, on ECG-ID and Apnea-ECG, CFAN demonstrated statistically significant improvements over the second-best method (CNN1D-FAN, $p \leq 0.02$), further validating its superior performance. Key innovations include CONV-FAN blocks that combine sine, cosine and GELU activations in convolutional layers to capture periodic features and joint time-frequency learning without spectrogram conversion. Our results highlight CFAN's potential for broader biomedical and signal classification applications.

Title: Soft Arm-Motor Thrust Characterization for a Pneumatically Actuated Soft Morphing Quadrotor
Authors: Vidya Sumathy, Jakub Haluska, George Nikolakopoulos
Abstract: In this work, an experimental characterization of the configuration space of a soft, pneumatically actuated morphing quadrotor is presented, with a focus on precise thrust characterization of its flexible arms, considering the effect of downwash. Unlike traditional quadrotors, the soft drone has pneumatically actuated arms, introducing complex, nonlinear interactions between motor thrust and arm deformation, which make precise control challenging. The silicone arms are actuated using differential pressure to achieve flexibility and thus have a variable workspace compared to their fixed counter-parts. The deflection of the soft arms during compression and expansion is controlled throughout the flight. However, in real time, the downwash from the motor attached at the tip of the soft arm generates a significant and random disturbance on the arm. This disturbance affects both the desired deflection of the arm and the overall stability of the system. To address this factor, an experimental characterization of the effect of downwash on the deflection angle of the arm is conducted.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Outperforms Supervised Fine-Tuning: A Case Study on Audio Question Answering
Authors: Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Heinrich Dinkel, Yadong Niu, Junbo Zhang, Jian Luan
Abstract: Recently, reinforcement learning (RL) has been shown to greatly enhance the reasoning capabilities of large language models (LLMs), and RL-based approaches have been progressively applied to visual multimodal tasks. However, the audio modality has largely been overlooked in these developments. Thus, we conduct a series of RL explorations in audio understanding and reasoning, specifically focusing on the audio question answering (AQA) task. We leverage the group relative policy optimization (GRPO) algorithm to Qwen2-Audio-7B-Instruct, and our experiments demonstrated state-of-the-art performance on the MMAU Test-mini benchmark, achieving an accuracy rate of 64.5%. The main findings in this technical report are as follows: 1) The GRPO algorithm can be effectively applied to large audio language models (LALMs), even when the model has only 8.2B parameters; 2) With only 38k post-training samples, RL significantly outperforms supervised fine-tuning (SFT), indicating that RL-based approaches can be effective without large datasets; 3) The explicit reasoning process has not shown significant benefits for AQA tasks, and how to efficiently utilize deep thinking remains an open question for further research; 4) LALMs still lag far behind humans auditory-language reasoning, suggesting that the RL-based approaches warrant further exploration.

Title: Deconstructing Jazz Piano Style Using Machine Learning
Authors: Huw Cheston, Reuben Bance, Peter M. C. Harrison
Abstract: Artistic style has been studied for centuries, and recent advances in machine learning create new possibilities for understanding it computationally. However, ensuring that machine-learning models produce insights aligned with the interests of practitioners and critics remains a significant challenge. Here, we focus on musical style, which benefits from a rich theoretical and mathematical analysis tradition. We train a variety of supervised-learning models to identify 20 iconic jazz musicians across a carefully curated dataset of 84 hours of recordings, and interpret their decision-making processes. Our models include a novel multi-input architecture that enables four musical domains (melody, harmony, rhythm, and dynamics) to be analysed separately. These models enable us to address fundamental questions in music theory and also advance the state-of-the-art in music performer identification (94% accuracy across 20 classes). We release open-source implementations of our models and an accompanying web application for exploring musical styles.

Title: Triple-identity Authentication: The Future of Secure Access
Authors: Suyun Borjigin
Abstract: In a typical authentication process, the local system verifies the user's identity using a stored hash value generated by a cross-system hash algorithm. This article shifts the research focus from traditional password encryption to the establishment of gatekeeping mechanisms for effective interactions between a system and the outside world. Here, we propose a triple-identity authentication system to achieve this goal. Specifically, this local system opens the inner structure of its hash algorithm to all user credentials, including the login name, login password, and authentication password. When a login credential is entered, the local system hashes it and then creates a unique identifier using intermediate hash elements randomly selected from the open algorithm. Importantly, this locally generated unique identifier (rather than the stored hash produced by the open algorithm) is utilized to verify the user's combined identity, which is generated by combining the entered credential with the International Mobile Equipment Identity and the International Mobile Subscriber Identity. The verification process is implemented at each interaction point: the login name field, the login password field, and the server's authentication point. Thus, within the context of this triple-identity authentication system, we establish a robust gatekeeping mechanism for system interactions, ultimately providing a level of security that is equivalent to multi-factor authentication.

Title: TSLFormer: A Lightweight Transformer Model for Turkish Sign Language Recognition Using Skeletal Landmarks
Authors: Kutay Ertürk, Furkan Altınışık, İrem Sarıaltın, Ömer Nezih Gerek
Abstract: This study presents TSLFormer, a light and robust word-level Turkish Sign Language (TSL) recognition model that treats sign gestures as ordered, string-like language. Instead of using raw RGB or depth videos, our method only works with 3D joint positions - articulation points - extracted using Google's Mediapipe library, which focuses on the hand and torso skeletal locations. This creates efficient input dimensionality reduction while preserving important semantic gesture information. Our approach revisits sign language recognition as sequence-to-sequence translation, inspired by the linguistic nature of sign languages and the success of transformers in natural language processing. Since TSLFormer uses the self-attention mechanism, it effectively captures temporal co-occurrence within gesture sequences and highlights meaningful motion patterns as words unfold. Evaluated on the AUTSL dataset with over 36,000 samples and 227 different words, TSLFormer achieves competitive performance with minimal computational cost. These results show that joint-based input is sufficient for enabling real-time, mobile, and assistive communication systems for hearing-impaired individuals.

Title: Fast Text-to-Audio Generation with Adversarial Post-Training
Authors: Zachary Novack, Zach Evans, Zack Zukowski, Josiah Taylor, CJ Carr, Julian Parker, Adnan Al-Sinan, Gian Marco Iodice, Julian McAuley, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Jordi Pons
Abstract: Text-to-audio systems, while increasingly performant, are slow at inference time, thus making their latency unpractical for many creative applications. We present Adversarial Relativistic-Contrastive (ARC) post-training, the first adversarial acceleration algorithm for diffusion/flow models not based on distillation. While past adversarial post-training methods have struggled to compare against their expensive distillation counterparts, ARC post-training is a simple procedure that (1) extends a recent relativistic adversarial formulation to diffusion/flow post-training and (2) combines it with a novel contrastive discriminator objective to encourage better prompt adherence. We pair ARC post-training with a number optimizations to Stable Audio Open and build a model capable of generating $\approx$12s of 44.1kHz stereo audio in $\approx$75ms on an H100, and $\approx$7s on a mobile edge-device, the fastest text-to-audio model to our knowledge.

Title: Communication-Efficient Distributed Online Nonconvex Optimization with Time-Varying Constraints
Authors: Kunpeng Zhang, Lei Xu, Xinlei Yi, Guanghui Wen, Ming Cao, Karl H. Johansson, Tianyou Chai, Tao Yang
Abstract: This paper considers distributed online nonconvex optimization with time-varying inequality constraints over a network of agents, where the nonconvex local loss and convex local constraint functions can vary arbitrarily across iterations, and the information of them is privately revealed to each agent at each iteration. For a uniformly jointly strongly connected time-varying directed graph, we propose two distributed bandit online primal--dual algorithm with compressed communication to efficiently utilize communication resources in the one-point and two-point bandit feedback settings, respectively. In nonconvex optimization, finding a globally optimal decision is often NP-hard. As a result, the standard regret metric used in online convex optimization becomes inapplicable. To measure the performance of the proposed algorithms, we use a network regret metric grounded in the first-order optimality condition associated with the variational inequality. We show that the compressed algorithms establish sublinear network regret and cumulative constraint violation bounds. Finally, a simulation example is presented to validate the theoretical results.
