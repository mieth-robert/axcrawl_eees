Title: Interpretable Auto Window Setting for Deep-Learning-Based CT Analysis
Authors: Yiqin Zhang, Meiling Chen, Zhengjie Zhang
Abstract: Whether during the early days of popularization or in the present, the window setting in Computed Tomography (CT) has always been an indispensable part of the CT analysis process. Although research has investigated the capabilities of CT multi-window fusion in enhancing neural networks, there remains a paucity of domain-invariant, intuitively interpretable methodologies for Auto Window Setting. In this work, we propose an plug-and-play module originate from Tanh activation function, which is compatible with mainstream deep learning architectures. Starting from the physical principles of CT, we adhere to the principle of interpretability to ensure the module's reliability for medical implementations. The domain-invariant design facilitates observation of the preference decisions rendered by the adaptive mechanism from a clinically intuitive perspective. This enables the proposed method to be understood not only by experts in neural networks but also garners higher trust from clinicians. We confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in multiple open-source datasets, yielding 10%~200% Dice improvements on hard segment targets.

Title: Underwater Image Enhancement using Generative Adversarial Networks: A Survey
Authors: Kancharagunta Kishan Babu, Ashreen Tabassum, Bommakanti Navaneeth, Tenneti Jahnavi, Yenka Akshaya
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a surge of research focused on underwater image enhancement using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), driven by the need to overcome the challenges posed by underwater environments. Issues such as light attenuation, scattering, and color distortion severely degrade the quality of underwater images, limiting their use in critical applications. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have emerged as a powerful tool for enhancing underwater photos due to their ability to learn complex transformations and generate realistic outputs. These advancements have been applied to real-world applications, including marine biology and ecosystem monitoring, coral reef health assessment, underwater archaeology, and autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) navigation. This paper explores all major approaches to underwater image enhancement, from physical and physics-free models to Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-based models and state-of-the-art GAN-based methods. It provides a comprehensive analysis of these methods, evaluation metrics, datasets, and loss functions, offering a holistic view of the field. Furthermore, the paper delves into the limitations and challenges faced by current methods, such as generalization issues, high computational demands, and dataset biases, while suggesting potential directions for future research.

Title: TTS-Transducer: End-to-End Speech Synthesis with Neural Transducer
Authors: Vladimir Bataev, Subhankar Ghosh, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Jason Li
Abstract: This work introduces TTS-Transducer - a novel architecture for text-to-speech, leveraging the strengths of audio codec models and neural transducers. Transducers, renowned for their superior quality and robustness in speech recognition, are employed to learn monotonic alignments and allow for avoiding using explicit duration predictors. Neural audio codecs efficiently compress audio into discrete codes, revealing the possibility of applying text modeling approaches to speech generation. However, the complexity of predicting multiple tokens per frame from several codebooks, as necessitated by audio codec models with residual quantizers, poses a significant challenge. The proposed system first uses a transducer architecture to learn monotonic alignments between tokenized text and speech codec tokens for the first codebook. Next, a non-autoregressive Transformer predicts the remaining codes using the alignment extracted from transducer loss. The proposed system is trained end-to-end. We show that TTS-Transducer is a competitive and robust alternative to contemporary TTS systems.

Title: A Comparison of Strategies to Embed Physics-Informed Neural Networks in Nonlinear Model Predictive Control Formulations Solved via Direct Transcription
Authors: Carlos Andrés Elorza Casas, Luis A. Ricardez-Sandoval, Joshua L. Pulsipher
Abstract: This study aims to benchmark candidate strategies for embedding neural network (NN) surrogates in nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) formulations that are subject to systems described with partial differential equations and that are solved via direct transcription (i.e., simultaneous methods). This study focuses on the use of physics-informed NNs and physics-informed convolutional NNs as the internal (surrogate) models within the NMPC formulation. One strategy embeds NN models as explicit algebraic constraints, leveraging the automatic differentiation (AD) of an algebraic modelling language (AML) to evaluate the derivatives. Alternatively, the solver can be provided with derivatives computed external to the AML via the AD routines of the machine learning environment the NN is trained in. The three numerical experiments considered in this work reveal that replacing mechanistic models with NN surrogates may not always offer computational advantages when smooth activation functions are used in conjunction with a local nonlinear solver (e.g., Ipopt), even with highly nonlinear systems. Moreover, in this context, the external function evaluation of the NN surrogates often outperforms the embedding strategies that rely on explicit algebraic constraints, likely due to the difficulty in initializing the auxiliary variables and constraints introduced by explicit algebraic reformulations.

Title: Low-Complexity Detection of Multiple Preambles in the Presence of Mobility and Delay Spread
Authors: Sandesh Rao Mattu, Beyza Dabak, Venkatesh Khammammetti, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Current wireless infrastructure is optimized to support downlink applications. This paper anticipates the emergence of applications where engineering focus shifts from downlink to uplink. The current paradigm of scheduling users on reserved uplink resources is not able to deal efficiently with unpredictable traffic patterns. As a result, 3GPP introduced the 2-step RACH as a mechanism to enable grant-free (random) initial access. The first of the two steps is preamble detection in a RACH slot, and in this paper we describe a low-complexity algorithm for simultaneous detection of multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread. We provide a pathway to standards adoption by choosing ZC sequences as preambles, as ZC sequences already appear in 5G standards. We construct preambles by using the discrete Zak transform to pass from a ZC sequence of length MN in the TD to a quasi-periodic MxN array in the DD domain. There are MN quasi-periodic Dirac pulses, each corresponding to a Zak-OTFS carrier waveform, and the ZC preamble is simply the corresponding sum of Zak-OTFS carrier waveforms. We detect multiple preambles in the presence of mobility and delay spread by sampling the received signal on the MxN period grid in the DD domain. We approach detection as a compressed sensing problem. We represent a preamble as a column of length MN in the DD domain and apply discrete shifts in delay and Doppler to produce a block with O(MN) columns in the compressed sensing matrix. The superposition of multiple preambles determines a block sparse sum of columns in the sensing matrix. The correlation properties of ZC sequences result in a highly structured compressed sensing matrix, making it possible to identify constituent preambles using OST, which has complexity O(M^3N^3). In this paper, we describe an algorithm with complexity that is O(M^2N^2) in the size of an individual column.

Title: Ultrasound Image Synthesis Using Generative AI for Lung Ultrasound Detection
Authors: Yu-Cheng Chou, Gary Y. Li, Li Chen, Mohsen Zahiri, Naveen Balaraju, Shubham Patil, Bryson Hicks, Nikolai Schnittke, David O. Kessler, Jeffrey Shupp, Maria Parker, Cristiana Baloescu, Christopher Moore, Cynthia Gregory, Kenton Gregory, Balasundar Raju, Jochen Kruecker, Alvin Chen
Abstract: Developing reliable healthcare AI models requires training with representative and diverse data. In imbalanced datasets, model performance tends to plateau on the more prevalent classes while remaining low on less common cases. To overcome this limitation, we propose DiffUltra, the first generative AI technique capable of synthesizing realistic Lung Ultrasound (LUS) images with extensive lesion variability. Specifically, we condition the generative AI by the introduced Lesion-anatomy Bank, which captures the lesion's structural and positional properties from real patient data to guide the image this http URL demonstrate that DiffUltra improves consolidation detection by 5.6% in AP compared to the models trained solely on real patient data. More importantly, DiffUltra increases data diversity and prevalence of rare cases, leading to a 25% AP improvement in detecting rare instances such as large lung consolidations, which make up only 10% of the dataset.

Authors: Bin Feng, Meng Zheng, Wei Liang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a generalizable deep neural network model for indoor pathloss radio map prediction (termed as IPP-Net). IPP-Net is based on a UNet architecture and learned from both large-scale ray tracing simulation data and a modified 3GPP indoor hotspot model. The performance of IPP-Net is evaluated in the First Indoor Pathloss Radio Map Prediction Challenge in ICASSP 2025. The evaluation results show that IPP-Net achieves a weighted root mean square error of 9.501 dB on three competition tasks and obtains the second overall ranking.

Title: Target Detection in ISAC Systems with Active RISs: A Multi-Perspective Observation Approach
Authors: Shoushuo Zhang, Rang Liu, Ming Li, Wei Wang, Qian Liu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a transformative technology for 6G networks, enabling the seamless integration of communication and sensing functionalities. Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS), with their capability to adaptively reconfigure the radio environment, have shown significant potential in enhancing communication quality and enabling advanced cooperative sensing. This paper investigates a multi-RIS-assisted ISAC system and introduces a novel multi-perspective observation framework that leverages the diversity of multiple observation paths, each exhibiting distinct spatial, delay, and Doppler characteristics for both target and clutter. The proposed framework integrates symbol-level precoding (SLP) and space-time adaptive processing (STAP) to fully exploit the benefits of multi-perspective observations, enabling superior target-clutter separation and significantly improving detection accuracy. The objective is to jointly design the transmit waveform, reflection coefficients of multiple active RISs, and spatial-temporal receive filters to maximize the radar output signal-to-clutter-plus-noise ratio (SCNR) for target detection, while ensuring the quality-of-service (QoS) requirements of communication users. To address the resulting non-convex optimization problem, an effective iterative algorithm is developed, combining fractional programming (FP), majorization-minimization (MM), and the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM). Extensive simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed multi-perspective observation strategy, demonstrating its advantages in improving target detection performance in challenging environments.

Title: Reinforcement Learning for Enhancing Sensing Estimation in Bistatic ISAC Systems with UAV Swarms
Authors: Obed Morrison Atsu, Salmane Naoumi, Roberto Bomfin, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL) framework to enhance integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) networks using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) swarms as sensing radars. By framing the positioning and trajectory optimization of UAVs as a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process, we develop a MARL approach that leverages centralized training with decentralized execution to maximize the overall sensing performance. Specifically, we implement a decentralized cooperative MARL strategy to enable UAVs to develop effective communication protocols, therefore enhancing their environmental awareness and operational efficiency. Additionally, we augment the MARL solution with a transmission power adaptation technique to mitigate interference between the communicating drones and optimize the communication protocol efficiency. Moreover, a transmission power adaptation technique is incorporated to mitigate interference and optimize the learned communication protocol efficiency. Despite the increased complexity, our solution demonstrates robust performance and adaptability across various scenarios, providing a scalable and cost-effective enhancement for future ISAC networks.

Title: Ptychography using Blind Multi-Mode PMACE
Authors: Qiuchen Zhai, Gregery T. Buzzard, Kevin Mertes, Brendt Wohlberg, Charles A. Bouman
Abstract: Ptychography is an imaging technique that enables nanometer-scale reconstruction of complex transmittance images by scanning objects with overlapping illumination patterns. However, the illumination function is typically unknown, which presents challenges for reconstruction, especially when using partially coherent light sources. In this paper, we introduce Blind Multi-Mode Projected Multi-Agent Consensus Equilibrium (BM-PMACE) for blind ptychographic reconstruction. We extend the PMACE framework for distributed inverse problems to jointly estimate the complex transmittance image and multiple, unknown, partially coherent probe functions. Importantly, our method maintains local probe estimates to exploit complementary information at multiple probe locations. Our method also incorporates a dynamic strategy for integrating additional probe modes. Through experimental simulations and validations using both synthetic and measured data, we demonstrate that BM-PMACE outperforms existing approaches in reconstruction quality and convergence rate.

Title: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge: Detecting Suicidal Risk Among Adolescents
Authors: Wen Wu, Ziyun Cui, Chang Lei, Yinan Duan, Diyang Qu, Ji Wu, Bowen Zhou, Runsen Chen, Chao Zhang
Abstract: The 1st SpeechWellness Challenge (SW1) aims to advance methods for detecting suicidal risk in adolescents using speech analysis techniques. Suicide among adolescents is a critical public health issue globally. Early detection of suicidal tendencies can lead to timely intervention and potentially save lives. Traditional methods of assessment often rely on self-reporting or clinical interviews, which may not always be accessible. The SW1 challenge addresses this gap by exploring speech as a non-invasive and readily available indicator of mental health. We release the SW1 dataset which contains speech recordings from 600 adolescents aged 10-18 years. By focusing on speech generated from natural tasks, the challenge seeks to uncover patterns and markers that correlate with suicidal risk.

Title: Speech Recognition for Automatically Assessing Afrikaans and isiXhosa Preschool Oral Narratives
Authors: Christiaan Jacobs, Annelien Smith, Daleen Klop, Ondřej Klejch, Febe de Wet, Herman Kamper
Abstract: We develop automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems for stories told by Afrikaans and isiXhosa preschool children. Oral narratives provide a way to assess children's language development before they learn to read. We consider a range of prior child-speech ASR strategies to determine which is best suited to this unique setting. Using Whisper and only 5 minutes of transcribed in-domain child speech, we find that additional in-domain adult data (adult speech matching the story domain) provides the biggest improvement, especially when coupled with voice conversion. Semi-supervised learning also helps for both languages, while parameter-efficient fine-tuning helps on Afrikaans but not on isiXhosa (which is under-represented in the Whisper model). Few child-speech studies look at non-English data, and even fewer at the preschool ages of 4 and 5. Our work therefore represents a unique validation of a wide range of previous child-speech ASR strategies in an under-explored setting.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimized Intelligent Resource Allocation in Active RIS-Integrated TN-NTN Networks
Authors: Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Hassan Rizwan, Muhammad Jazib, Muhammad Iqbal, Muhammad Bilal, Tabinda Ashraf, Muhammad Farhan Khan, Jen-Yi Pan
Abstract: This work explores the deployment of active reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (A-RIS) in integrated terrestrial and non-terrestrial networks (TN-NTN) while utilizing coordinated multipoint non-orthogonal multiple access (CoMP-NOMA). Our system model incorporates a UAV-assisted RIS in coordination with a terrestrial RIS which aims for signal enhancement. We aim to maximize the sum rate for all users in the network using a custom hybrid proximal policy optimization (H-PPO) algorithm by optimizing the UAV trajectory, base station (BS) power allocation factors, active RIS amplification factor, and phase shift matrix. We integrate edge users into NOMA pairs to achieve diversity gain, further enhancing the overall experience for edge users. Exhaustive comparisons are made with passive RIS-assisted networks to demonstrate the superior efficacy of active RIS in terms of energy efficiency, outage probability, and network sum rate.

Title: TopoFormer: Integrating Transformers and ConvLSTMs for Coastal Topography Prediction
Authors: Santosh Munian, Oktay Karakuş, William Russell, Gwyn Nelson
Abstract: This paper presents \textit{TopoFormer}, a novel hybrid deep learning architecture that integrates transformer-based encoders with convolutional long short-term memory (ConvLSTM) layers for the precise prediction of topographic beach profiles referenced to elevation datums, with a particular focus on Mean Low Water Springs (MLWS) and Mean Low Water Neaps (MLWN). Accurate topographic estimation down to MLWS is critical for coastal management, navigation safety, and environmental monitoring. Leveraging a comprehensive dataset from the Wales Coastal Monitoring Centre (WCMC), consisting of over 2000 surveys across 36 coastal survey units, TopoFormer addresses key challenges in topographic prediction, including temporal variability and data gaps in survey measurements. The architecture uniquely combines multi-head attention mechanisms and ConvLSTM layers to capture both long-range dependencies and localized temporal patterns inherent in beach profiles data. TopoFormer's predictive performance was rigorously evaluated against state-of-the-art models, including DenseNet, 1D/2D CNNs, and LSTMs. While all models demonstrated strong performance, \textit{TopoFormer} achieved the lowest mean absolute error (MAE), as low as 2 cm, and provided superior accuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) evaluations.

Title: Cooperative Optimal Output Tracking for Discrete-Time Multiagent Systems: Stabilizing Policy Iteration Frameworks and Analysis
Authors: Dongdong Li, Jiuxiang Dong
Abstract: In this paper, two model-free optimal output tracking frameworks based on policy iteration for discrete-time multi-agent systems are proposed. First, we establish a framework of stabilizing policy iteration that can start from any initial feedback control policy, relaxing the dependence of traditional policy iteration on the initial stabilizing control policy. Then, another efficient and equivalent $Q$-learning policy iteration framework is developed, which is shown to require only less system data to get the same results as the stabilizing policy iteration. Both frameworks obtain stabilizing control policy by iterating the stabilizing virtual closed-loop system step-by-step to the actual closed-loop system. Multiple explicit schemes for the iteration step-size/coefficient are designed and their stability during the above iterations is analyzed. By using the generated closed-loop stabilizing control policy and two frameworks, the optimal feedback control gain is obtained. The approximate solution of the regulator equations is found by model-free iteration, which leads to the optimal feedforward gain. Finally, the cooperative optimal output tracking is realized by a distributed feedforward-feedback controller. The proposed algorithms are validated by simulation.

Title: Multi-modal Speech Enhancement with Limited Electromyography Channels
Authors: Fuyuan Feng, Longting Xu, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) aims to improve the clarity, intelligibility, and quality of speech signals for various speech enabled applications. However, air-conducted (AC) speech is highly susceptible to ambient noise, particularly in low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and non-stationary noise environments. Incorporating multi-modal information has shown promise in enhancing speech in such challenging scenarios. Electromyography (EMG) signals, which capture muscle activity during speech production, offer noise-resistant properties beneficial for SE in adverse conditions. Most previous EMG-based SE methods required 35 EMG channels, limiting their practicality. To address this, we propose a novel method that considers only 8-channel EMG signals with acoustic signals using a modified SEMamba network with added cross-modality modules. Our experiments demonstrate substantial improvements in speech quality and intelligibility over traditional approaches, especially in extremely low SNR settings. Notably, compared to the SE (AC) approach, our method achieves a significant PESQ gain of 0.235 under matched low SNR conditions and 0.527 under mismatched conditions, highlighting its robustness.

Title: When xURLLC Meets NOMA: A Stochastic Network Calculus Perspective
Authors: Yuang Chen, Hancheng Lu, Langtin Qin, Yansha Deng, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: The advent of next-generation ultra-reliable and low-latency communications (xURLLC) presents stringent and unprecedented requirements for key performance indicators (KPIs). As a disruptive technology, non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) harbors the potential to fulfill these stringent KPIs essential for xURLLC. However, the immaturity of research on the tail distributions of these KPIs significantly impedes the application of NOMA to xURLLC. Stochastic network calculus (SNC), as a potent methodology, is leveraged to provide dependable theoretical insights into tail distribution analysis and statistical QoS provisioning (SQP). In this article, we develop a NOMA-assisted uplink xURLLC network architecture that incorporates an SNC-based SQP theoretical framework (SNC-SQP) to support tail distribution analysis in terms of delay, age-of-information (AoI), and reliability. Based on SNC-SQP, an SQP-driven power optimization problem is proposed to minimize transmit power while guaranteeing xURLLC's KPIs on delay, AoI, reliability, and power consumption. Extensive simulations validate our proposed theoretical framework and demonstrate that the proposed power allocation scheme significantly reduces uplink transmit power and outperforms conventional schemes in terms of SQP performance.

Title: Discrete Speech Unit Extraction via Independent Component Analysis
Authors: Tomohiko Nakamura, Kwanghee Choi, Keigo Hojo, Yoshiaki Bando, Satoru Fukayama, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Self-supervised speech models (S3Ms) have become a common tool for the speech processing community, leveraging representations for downstream tasks. Clustering S3M representations yields discrete speech units (DSUs), which serve as compact representations for speech signals. DSUs are typically obtained by k-means clustering. Using DSUs often leads to strong performance in various tasks, including automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, even with the high dimensionality and redundancy of S3M representations, preprocessing S3M representations for better clustering remains unexplored, even though it can affect the quality of DSUs. In this paper, we investigate the potential of linear preprocessing methods for extracting DSUs. We evaluate standardization, principal component analysis, whitening, and independent component analysis (ICA) on DSU-based ASR benchmarks and demonstrate their effectiveness as preprocessing for k-means. We also conduct extensive analyses of their behavior, such as orthogonality or interpretability of individual components of ICA.

Title: Modeling the residual queue and queue-dependent capacity in a static traffic assignment problem
Authors: Hao Fu, William H.K. Lam, Wei Ma, Yuxin Shi, Rui Jiang, Huijun Sun, Ziyou Gao
Abstract: The residual queue during a given study period (e.g., peak hour) is an important feature that should be considered when solving a traffic assignment problem under equilibrium for strategic traffic planning. Although studies have focused extensively on static or quasi-dynamic traffic assignment models considering the residual queue, they have failed to capture the situation wherein the equilibrium link flow passing through the link is less than the link physical capacity under congested conditions. To address this critical issue, we introduce a novel static traffic assignment model that explicitly incorporates the residual queue and queue-dependent link capacity. The proposed model ensures that equilibrium link flows remain within the physical capacity bounds, yielding estimations more aligned with data observed by traffic detectors, especially in oversaturated scenarios. A generalized link cost function considering queue-dependent capacity, with an additional queuing delay term is proposed. The queuing delay term represents the added travel cost under congestion, offering a framework wherein conventional static models, both with and without physical capacity constraints, become special cases of our model. Our study rigorously analyzes the mathematical properties of the new model, establishing the theoretical uniqueness of solutions for link flow and residual queue under certain conditions. We also introduce a gradient projection-based alternating minimization algorithm tailored for the proposed model. Numerical examples are conducted to demonstrate the superiority and merit of the proposed model and solution algorithm.

Title: Fast multi-contrast MRI using joint multiscale energy model
Authors: Nima Yaghoobi, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Yan Chen, Steve R. Kecskemeti, James H. Holmes, Mathews Jacob
Abstract: The acquisition of 3D multicontrast MRI data with good isotropic spatial resolution is challenged by lengthy scan times. In this work, we introduce a CNN-based multiscale energy model to learn the joint probability distribution of the multi-contrast images. The joint recovery of the contrasts from undersampled data is posed as a maximum a posteriori estimation scheme, where the learned energy serves as the prior. We use a majorize-minimize algorithm to solve the optimization scheme. The proposed model leverages the redundancies across different contrasts to improve image fidelity. The proposed scheme is observed to preserve fine details and contrast, offering sharper reconstructions compared to reconstruction methods that independently recover the contrasts. While we focus on 3D MPNRAGE acquisitions in this work, the proposed approach is generalizable to arbitrary multi-contrast settings.

Title: A Reduced Order Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (ILQR) Technique for the Optimal Control of Nonlinear Partial Differential Equations
Authors: Aayushman Sharma, Suman Chakravorty
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a reduced order model-based reinforcement learning (MBRL) approach, utilizing the Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (ILQR) algorithm for the optimal control of nonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The approach proposes a novel modification of the ILQR technique: it uses the Method of Snapshots to identify a reduced order Linear Time Varying (LTV) approximation of the nonlinear PDE dynamics around a current estimate of the optimal trajectory, utilizes the identified LTV model to solve a time-varying reduced order LQR problem to obtain an improved estimate of the optimal trajectory along with a new reduced basis, and iterates till convergence. The convergence behavior of the reduced order approach is analyzed and the algorithm is shown to converge to a limit set that is dependent on the truncation error in the reduction. The proposed approach is tested on the viscous Burger's equation and two phase-field models for microstructure evolution in materials, and the results show that there is a significant reduction in the computational burden over the standard ILQR approach, without significantly sacrificing performance.

Title: Sidelobe Level Reduction in the ACF of NLFM Signals Using the Smoothing Spline Method
Authors: Roohollah Ghavamirad, Ramezan Ali Sadeghzadeh, Mohammad Ali Sebt
Abstract: The high level of sidelobes in the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear frequency modulation signal is a challenge. One of the conventional methods to reduce the sidelobe levels is to use the principle of stationary phase. In this method, the frequency function is calculated using a selection window. The signal frequency function cannot be obtained in closed form and numerical methods must be used to find it. This is usually done using the polynomial curve fitting. In this paper, the frequency function of the signal has been obtained using the smoothing spline method. The simulation results show an improvement of 10 dB to 20 dB in the peak sidelobe level of the autocorrelation function of the nonlinear frequency modulation signal compared to the previous methods.

Title: A Geometric Analysis-Based Safety Assessment Framework for MASS Route Decision-Making in Restricted Waters
Authors: Zilong Xu, Zihao Wang, He Li, Dingli Yu, Zaili Yang, Jin Wang
Abstract: To enhance the safety of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) navigating in restricted waters, this paper aims to develop a geometric analysis-based route safety assessment (GARSA) framework, specifically designed for their route decision-making in irregularly shaped waterways. Utilizing line and point geometric elements to define waterway boundaries, the framework enables to construct a dynamic width characterization function to quantify spatial safety along intricate waterways. An iterative method is developed to calculate this function, enabling an abstracted spatial property representation of the waterways. Based on this, we introduce a navigational safety index that balances global navigational safety and local risk to determine the safest route. To accommodate ship kinematic constraints, path modifications are applied using a dynamic window approach. A case study in a simulated Port of Hamburg environment shows that GARSA effectively identifies safe routes and avoids the risk of entering narrow waterways in an autonomous manner, thereby prioritizing safety in route decision-making for MASS in confined waters.

Title: Coordinated Deliverable Energy Flexibility from EV Aggregators in Distribution Networks
Authors: Arash Baharvandi, Duong Tung Nguyen
Abstract: This paper presents a coordinated framework to optimize electric vehicle (EV) charging considering grid constraints and system uncertainties. The proposed framework consists of two optimization models. In particular, the distribution system operator (DSO) solves the first model to optimize the amount of deliverable energy flexibility that can be obtained from EV aggregators. To address the uncertainties of loads and solar energy generation, a hybrid robust/stochastic approach is employed, enabling the transformation of uncertainty-related constraints into a set of equivalent deterministic constraints. Once the DSO has computed the optimal energy flexibility, each aggregator utilizes the second optimization model to optimize the charging schedule for its respective fleet of EVs. Numerical simulations are performed on a modified IEEE 33-bus distribution network to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed framework.

Title: Wavelet Integrated Convolutional Neural Network for ECG Signal Denoising
Authors: Takamasa Terada, Masahiro Toyoura
Abstract: Wearable electrocardiogram (ECG) measurement using dry electrodes has a problem with high-intensity noise distortion. Hence, a robust noise reduction method is required. However, overlapping frequency bands of ECG and noise make noise reduction difficult. Hence, it is necessary to provide a mechanism that changes the characteristics of the noise based on its intensity and type. This study proposes a convolutional neural network (CNN) model with an additional wavelet transform layer that extracts the specific frequency features in a clean ECG. Testing confirms that the proposed method effectively predicts accurate ECG behavior with reduced noise by accounting for all frequency domains. In an experiment, noisy signals in the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) range of -10-10 are evaluated, demonstrating that the efficiency of the proposed method is higher when the SNR is small.

Title: Integrating Pause Information with Word Embeddings in Language Models for Alzheimer's Disease Detection from Spontaneous Speech
Authors: Yu Pu, Wei-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline and memory loss. Early detection of AD is crucial for effective intervention and treatment. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to AD detection from spontaneous speech, which incorporates pause information into language models. Our method involves encoding pause information into embeddings and integrating them into the typical transformer-based language model, enabling it to capture both semantic and temporal features of speech data. We conduct experiments on the Alzheimer's Dementia Recognition through Spontaneous Speech (ADReSS) dataset and its extension, the ADReSSo dataset, comparing our method with existing approaches. Our method achieves an accuracy of 83.1% in the ADReSSo test set. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in discriminating between AD patients and healthy individuals, highlighting the potential of pauses as a valuable indicator for AD detection. By leveraging speech analysis as a non-invasive and cost-effective tool for AD detection, our research contributes to early diagnosis and improved management of this debilitating disease.

Title: Multi-Carrier Faster-Than-Nyquist Signaling for OTFS Systems
Authors: Xueyang Wang, Shiqi Gong, Wenqian Shen, Chengwen Xing, J. Andrew Zhang
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation technique is promising for high-mobility applications to achieve reliable communications. However, the capacity of OTFS systems is generally limited by the Nyquist criterion, requiring orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-carrier faster-than-Nyquist (MC-FTN) signaling scheme for OTFS systems. By adopting non-orthogonal pulses in both time and frequency domains, our scheme significantly improves the capacity of OTFS systems. Specifically, we firstly develop the signal models for both single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) OTFS systems. Then, we optimize the delay-Doppler (DD) domain precoding matrix at the transmitter to suppress both the inter-symbol interference (ISI) and inter-carrier interference (ICI) introduced by the MC-FTN signaling. For SISO systems, we develop an eigenvalue decomposition (EVD) precoding scheme with optimal power allocation (PA) for achieving the maximum capacity. For MIMO systems, we develop a successive interference cancellation (SIC)-based precoding scheme via decomposing the capacity maximization problem into multiple sub-capacity maximization problems with largely reduced dimensions of optimization variables. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MC-FTN-OTFS signaling scheme achieves significantly higher capacity than traditional Nyquist-criterion-based OTFS systems. Moreover, the SIC-based precoding scheme can effectively reduce the complexity of MIMO capacity maximization, while attaining performance close to the optimal EVD-based precoding scheme.

Title: Robust Phantom-Assisted Framework for Multi-Person Localization and Vital Signs Monitoring Using MIMO FMCW Radar
Authors: Yonathan Eder, Emma Zagoury, Shlomi Savariego, Moshe Namer, Oded Cohen, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: With the rising prevalence of cardiovascular and respiratory disorders and an aging global population, healthcare systems face increasing pressure to adopt efficient, non-contact vital sign monitoring (NCVSM) solutions. This study introduces a robust framework for multi-person localization and vital signs monitoring, using multiple-input-multiple-output frequency-modulated continuous wave radar, addressing challenges in real-world, cluttered environments. Two key contributions are presented. First, a custom hardware phantom was developed to simulate multi-person NCVSM scenarios, utilizing recorded thoracic impedance signals to replicate realistic cardiopulmonary dynamics. The phantom's design facilitates repeatable and rapid validation of radar systems and algorithms under diverse conditions to accelerate deployment in human monitoring. Second, aided by the phantom, we designed a robust algorithm for multi-person localization utilizing joint sparsity and cardiopulmonary properties, alongside harmonics-resilient dictionary-based vital signs estimation, to mitigate interfering respiration harmonics. Additionally, an adaptive signal refinement procedure is introduced to enhance the accuracy of continuous NCVSM by leveraging the continuity of the estimates. Performance was validated and compared to existing techniques through 12 phantom trials and 12 human trials, including both single- and multi-person scenarios, demonstrating superior localization and NCVSM performance. For example, in multi-person human trials, our method achieved average respiration rate estimation accuracies of 94.14%, 98.12%, and 98.69% within error thresholds of 2, 3, and 4 breaths per minute, respectively, and heart rate accuracies of 87.10%, 94.12%, and 95.54% within the same thresholds. These results highlight the potential of this framework for reliable multi-person NCVSM in healthcare and IoT applications.

Title: Generative AI Enabled Robust Sensor Placement in Cyber-Physical Power Systems: A Graph Diffusion Approach

Abstract: With advancements in physical power systems and network technologies, integrated Cyber-Physical Power Systems (CPPS) have significantly enhanced system monitoring and control efficiency and reliability. This integration, however, introduces complex challenges in designing coherent CPPS, particularly as few studies concurrently address the deployment of physical layers and communication connections in the cyber layer. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a framework for robust sensor placement to optimize anomaly detection in the physical layer and enhance communication resilience in the cyber layer. We model the CPPS as an interdependent network via a graph, allowing for simultaneous consideration of both layers. Then, we adopt the Log-normal Shadowing Path Loss (LNSPL) model to ensure reliable data transmission. Additionally, we leverage the Fiedler value to measure graph resilience against line failures and three anomaly detectors to fortify system safety. However, the optimization problem is NP-hard. Therefore, we introduce the Experience Feedback Graph Diffusion (EFGD) algorithm, which utilizes a diffusion process to generate optimal sensor placement strategies. This algorithm incorporates cross-entropy gradient and experience feedback mechanisms to expedite convergence and generate higher reward strategies. Extensive simulations demonstrate that the EFGD algorithm enhances model convergence by 18.9% over existing graph diffusion methods and improves average reward by 22.90% compared to Denoising Diffusion Policy Optimization (DDPO) and 19.57% compared to Graph Diffusion Policy Optimization (GDPO), thereby significantly bolstering the robustness and reliability of CPPS operations.

Title: Differentially Private Gradient-Tracking-Based Distributed Stochastic Optimization over Directed Graphs
Authors: Jialong Chen, Jimin Wang, Ji-Feng Zhang
Abstract: This paper proposes a new differentially private gradient-tracking-based distributed stochastic optimization algorithm over directed graphs. Specifically, privacy noises are added to each agent's state and tracking variable to prevent information leakage, and then perturbed states and tracking variables are transmitted to neighbors. We design two novel schemes of the iteration step-sizes and the sampling number for the algorithm. By using the sampling parameter-controlled subsampling method, both schemes enhance the differential privacy level, and achieve the finite cumulative privacy budget even over infinite iterations. The convergence rate of the algorithm is shown for both nonconvex with the Polyak-Lojasiewicz condition and strongly convex objectives: Scheme (S1) achieves the polynomial convergence rate, and Scheme (S2) achieves the exponential convergence rate. The trade-off between the privacy and the convergence rate is presented. The algorithm's effectiveness and superior performance over the existing works are demonstrated through numerical examples of distributed training on benchmark datasets "MNIST" and "CIFAR-10".

Title: Improving Cross-Lingual Phonetic Representation of Low-Resource Languages Through Language Similarity Analysis
Authors: Minu Kim, Kangwook Jang, Hoirin Kim
Abstract: This paper examines how linguistic similarity affects cross-lingual phonetic representation in speech processing for low-resource languages, emphasizing effective source language selection. Previous cross-lingual research has used various source languages to enhance performance for the target low-resource language without thorough consideration of selection. Our study stands out by providing an in-depth analysis of language selection, supported by a practical approach to assess phonetic proximity among multiple language families. We investigate how within-family similarity impacts performance in multilingual training, which aids in understanding language dynamics. We also evaluate the effect of using phonologically similar languages, regardless of family. For the phoneme recognition task, utilizing phonologically similar languages consistently achieves a relative improvement of 55.6% over monolingual training, even surpassing the performance of a large-scale self-supervised learning model. Multilingual training within the same language family demonstrates that higher phonological similarity enhances performance, while lower similarity results in degraded performance compared to monolingual training.

Title: Improved joint modelling of breast cancer radiomics features and hazard by image registration aided longitudinal CT data
Authors: Subrata Mukherjee
Abstract: Patients with metastatic breast cancer (mBC) undergo continuous medical imaging during treatment, making accurate lesion detection and monitoring over time critical for clinical decisions. Predicting drug response from post-treatment data is essential for personalized care and pharmacological research. In collaboration with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Novartis Pharmaceuticals, we analyzed serial chest CT scans from two large-scale Phase III trials, MONALEESA 3 and MONALEESA 7. This paper has two objectives (a) Data Structuring developing a Registration Aided Automated Correspondence (RAMAC) algorithm for precise lesion tracking in longitudinal CT data, and (b) Survival Analysis creating imaging features and models from RAMAC structured data to predict patient outcomes. The RAMAC algorithm uses a two phase pipeline: three dimensional rigid registration aligns CT images, and a distance metric-based Hungarian algorithm tracks lesion correspondence. Using structured data, we developed interpretable models to assess progression-free survival (PFS) in mBC patients by combining baseline radiomics, post-treatment changes (Weeks 8, 16, 24), and demographic features. Radiomics effects were studied across time points separately and through a non-correlated additive framework. Radiomics features were reduced using (a) a regularized (L1-penalized) additive Cox proportional hazards model, and (b) variable selection via best subset selection. Performance, measured using the concordance index (C-index), improved with additional time points. Joint modeling, considering correlations among radiomics effects over time, provided insights into relationships between longitudinal radiomics and survival outcomes.

Title: Generalized and Efficient 2D Gaussian Splatting for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution
Authors: Du Chen, Liyi Chen, Zhengqiang Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Equipped with the continuous representation capability of Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP), Implicit Neural Representation (INR) has been successfully employed for Arbitrary-scale Super-Resolution (ASR). However, the limited receptive field of the linear layers in MLP restricts the representation capability of INR, while it is computationally expensive to query the MLP numerous times to render each pixel. Recently, Gaussian Splatting (GS) has shown its advantages over INR in both visual quality and rendering speed in 3D tasks, which motivates us to explore whether GS can be employed for the ASR task. However, directly applying GS to ASR is exceptionally challenging because the original GS is an optimization-based method through overfitting each single scene, while in ASR we aim to learn a single model that can generalize to different images and scaling factors. We overcome these challenges by developing two novel techniques. Firstly, to generalize GS for ASR, we elaborately design an architecture to predict the corresponding image-conditioned Gaussians of the input low-resolution image in a feed-forward manner. Secondly, we implement an efficient differentiable 2D GPU/CUDA-based scale-aware rasterization to render super-resolved images by sampling discrete RGB values from the predicted contiguous Gaussians. Via end-to-end training, our optimized network, namely GSASR, can perform ASR for any image and unseen scaling factors. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method.

Title: Gaussian Integral based Bayesian Smoother
Authors: Rohit Kumar Singh, Kundan Kumar, Shovan Bhaumik
Abstract: This work introduces the Gaussian integration to address a smoothing problem of a nonlinear stochastic state space model. The probability densities of states at each time instant are assumed to be Gaussian, and their means and covariances are evaluated by utilizing the odd-even properties of Gaussian integral, which are further utilized to realize Rauch-Tung-Striebel (RTS) smoothing expressions. Given that the Gaussian integration provides an exact solution for the integral of a polynomial function over a Gaussian probability density function, it is anticipated to provide more accurate results than other existing Gaussian approximation-based smoothers such as extended Kalman, cubature Kalman, and unscented Kalman smoothers, especially when polynomial types of nonlinearity are present in the state space models. The developed smoothing algorithm is applied to the Van der Pol oscillator, where the nonlinearity associated with their dynamics is represented using polynomial functions. Simulation results are provided to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Optimizing Phase Allocation in Unbalanced Power Distribution Networks using a Linearized DistFlow Formulation
Authors: Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: Power distribution networks, especially in North America, are often unbalanced but are designed to keep unbalance levels within the limits specified by IEEE, IEC, and NEMA standards. However, rapid integration of unbalanced devices, such as electric vehicle (EV) chargers and single-phase solar plants, can exacerbate these imbalances. This increase can trigger protection devices, increase losses, and potentially damage devices. To address this issue, phase swapping (or phase allocation) has been proposed. Existing approaches predominantly rely on heuristic methods. In this work, we develop a mixed integer linear programming (MILP) approach for phase allocation. Our approach uses linearized DistFlow equations to represent the distribution network and incorporates a phase consistency constraint, enforced with binary variables, to ensure that downstream phase configurations align with upstream configurations. We validate the proposed approach on multiple benchmark test cases and demonstrate that it effectively improves network balance, as quantified by various metrics.

Title: Super-Resolution of 3D Micro-CT Images Using Generative Adversarial Networks: Enhancing Resolution and Segmentation Accuracy
Authors: Evgeny Ugolkov, Xupeng He, Hyung Kwak, Hussein Hoteit
Abstract: We develop a procedure for substantially improving the quality of segmented 3D micro-Computed Tomography (micro-CT) images of rocks with a Machine Learning (ML) Generative Model. The proposed model enhances the resolution eightfold (8x) and addresses segmentation inaccuracies due to the overlapping X-ray attenuation in micro-CT measurement for different rock minerals and phases. The proposed generative model is a 3D Deep Convolutional Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network with Gradient Penalty (3D DC WGAN-GP). The algorithm is trained on segmented 3D low-resolution micro-CT images and segmented unpaired complementary 2D high-resolution Laser Scanning Microscope (LSM) images. The algorithm was demonstrated on multiple samples of Berea sandstones. We achieved high-quality super-resolved 3D images with a resolution of 0.4375 micro-m/voxel and accurate segmentation for constituting minerals and pore space. The described procedure can significantly expand the modern capabilities of digital rock physics.

Title: Collaborative Human Activity Recognition with Passive Inter-Body Electrostatic Field
Authors: Sizhen Bian, Vitor Fortes Rey, Siyu Yuan, Paul Lukowicz
Abstract: The passive body-area electrostatic field has recently been aspiringly explored for wearable motion sensing, harnessing its two thrilling characteristics: full-body motion sensitivity and environmental sensitivity, which potentially empowers human activity recognition both independently and jointly from a single sensing front-end and theoretically brings significant competition against traditional inertial sensor that is incapable in environmental variations sensing. While most works focus on exploring the electrostatic field of a single body as the target, this work, for the first time, quantitatively evaluates the mutual effect of inter-body electrostatic fields and its contribution to collaborative activity recognition. A wearable electrostatic field sensing front-end and wrist-worn prototypes are built, and a sixteen-hour, manually annotated dataset is collected, involving an experiment of manipulating objects both independently and collaboratively. A regression model is finally used to recognize the collaborative activities among users. Despite the theoretical advantages of the body electrostatic field, the recognition of both single and collaborative activities shows unanticipated less-competitive recognition performance compared with the accelerometer. However, It is worth mentioning that this novel sensing modality improves the recognition F-score of user collaboration by 16\% in the fusion result of the two wearable motion sensing modalities, demonstrating the potential of bringing body electrostatic field as a complementary power-efficient signal for collaborative activity tracking using wearables.

Title: OpenGERT: Open Source Automated Geometry Extraction with Geometric and Electromagnetic Sensitivity Analyses for Ray-Tracing Propagation Models
Authors: Serhat Tadik, Rajib Bhattacharjea, Johnathan Corgan, David Johnson, Jacobus Van der Merwe, Gregory D. Durgin
Abstract: Accurate RF propagation modeling in urban environments is critical for developing digital spectrum twins and optimizing wireless communication systems. We introduce OpenGERT, an open-source automated Geometry Extraction tool for Ray Tracing, which collects and processes terrain and building data from OpenStreetMap, Microsoft Global ML Building Footprints, and USGS elevation data. Using the Blender Python API, it creates detailed urban models for high-fidelity simulations with NVIDIA Sionna RT. We perform sensitivity analyses to examine how variations in building height, position, and electromagnetic material properties affect ray-tracing accuracy. Specifically, we present pairwise dispersion plots of channel statistics (path gain, mean excess delay, delay spread, link outage, and Rician K-factor) and investigate how their sensitivities change with distance from transmitters. We also visualize the variance of these statistics for selected transmitter locations to gain deeper insights. Our study covers Munich and Etoile scenes, each with 10 transmitter locations. For each location, we apply five types of perturbations: material, position, height, height-position, and all combined, with 50 perturbations each. Results show that small changes in permittivity and conductivity minimally affect channel statistics, whereas variations in building height and position significantly alter all statistics, even with noise standard deviations of 1 meter in height and 0.4 meters in position. These findings highlight the importance of precise environmental modeling for accurate propagation predictions, essential for digital spectrum twins and advanced communication networks.

Title: Global Search for Optimal Low Thrust Spacecraft Trajectories using Diffusion Models and the Indirect Method
Authors: Jannik Graebner, Ryne Beeson
Abstract: Long time-duration low-thrust nonlinear optimal spacecraft trajectory global search is a computationally and time expensive problem characterized by clustering patterns in locally optimal solutions. During preliminary mission design, mission parameters are subject to frequent changes, necessitating that trajectory designers efficiently generate high-quality control solutions for these new scenarios. Generative machine learning models can be trained to learn how the solution structure varies with respect to a conditional parameter, thereby accelerating the global search for missions with updated parameters. In this work, state-of-the-art diffusion models are integrated with the indirect approach for trajectory optimization within a global search framework. This framework is tested on two low-thrust transfers of different complexity in the circular restricted three-body problem. By generating and analyzing a training data set, we develop mathematical relations and techniques to understand the complex structures in the costate domain of locally optimal solutions for these problems. A diffusion model is trained on this data and successfully accelerates the global search for both problems. The model predicts how the costate solution structure changes, based on the maximum spacecraft thrust magnitude. Warm-starting a numerical solver with diffusion model samples for the costates at the initial time increases the number of solutions generated per minute for problems with unseen thrust magnitudes by one to two orders of magnitude in comparison to samples from a uniform distribution and from an adjoint control transformation.

Title: Advancing Single-Snapshot DOA Estimation with Siamese Neural Networks for Sparse Linear Arrays
Authors: Ruxin Zheng, Shunqiao Sun, Hongshan Liu, Yimin D. Zhang
Abstract: Single-snapshot signal processing in sparse linear arrays has become increasingly vital, particularly in dynamic environments like automotive radar systems, where only limited snapshots are available. These arrays are often utilized either to cut manufacturing costs or result from unintended antenna failures, leading to challenges such as high sidelobe levels and compromised accuracy in direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation. Despite deep learning's success in tasks such as DOA estimation, the need for extensive training data to increase target numbers or improve angular resolution poses significant challenges. In response, this paper presents a novel Siamese neural network (SNN) featuring a sparse augmentation layer, which enhances signal feature embedding and DOA estimation accuracy in sparse arrays. We demonstrate the enhanced DOA estimation performance of our approach through detailed feature analysis and performance evaluation. The code for this study is available at this https URL.

Title: A Multi-Modal Deep Learning Framework for Pan-Cancer Prognosis
Authors: Binyu Zhang, Shichao Li, Junpeng Jian, Zhu Meng, Limei Guo, Zhicheng Zhao
Abstract: Prognostic task is of great importance as it closely related to the survival analysis of patients, the optimization of treatment plans and the allocation of resources. The existing prognostic models have shown promising results on specific datasets, but there are limitations in two aspects. On the one hand, they merely explore certain types of modal data, such as patient histopathology WSI and gene expression analysis. On the other hand, they adopt the per-cancer-per-model paradigm, which means the trained models can only predict the prognostic effect of a single type of cancer, resulting in weak generalization ability. In this paper, a deep-learning based model, named UMPSNet, is proposed. Specifically, to comprehensively understand the condition of patients, in addition to constructing encoders for histopathology images and genomic expression profiles respectively, UMPSNet further integrates four types of important meta data (demographic information, cancer type information, treatment protocols, and diagnosis results) into text templates, and then introduces a text encoder to extract textual features. In addition, the optimal transport OT-based attention mechanism is utilized to align and fuse features of different modalities. Furthermore, a guided soft mixture of experts (GMoE) mechanism is introduced to effectively address the issue of distribution differences among multiple cancer datasets. By incorporating the multi-modality of patient data and joint training, UMPSNet outperforms all SOTA approaches, and moreover, it demonstrates the effectiveness and generalization ability of the proposed learning paradigm of a single model for multiple cancer types. The code of UMPSNet is available at this https URL.

Title: IEEE_TIE25: Analysis and Synthesis of DOb-based Robust Motion Controllers
Authors: Emre Sariyildiz
Abstract: By employing a unified state-space design framework, this paper proposes a novel systematic analysis and synthesis method that facilitates the implementation of both conventional zero-order (ZO) and high-order (HO) DObs. Furthermore, this design method supports the development of advanced DObs (e.g., the proposed High-Performance (HP) DOb in this paper), enabling more accurate disturbance estimation and, consequently, enhancing the robust stability and performance of motion control systems. Lyapunov direct method is employed in the discrete-time domain to analyse the stability of the proposed digital robust motion controllers. The analysis demonstrates that the proposed DObs are stable in the sense that the estimation error is uniformly ultimately bounded when subjected to bounded disturbances. Additionally, they are proven to be asymptotically stable under specific disturbance conditions, such as constant disturbances for the ZO and HP DObs. Stability constraints on the design parameters of the DObs are analytically derived, providing effective synthesis tools for the implementation of the digital robust motion controllers. The discrete-time analysis facilitates the derivation of more practical design constraints. The proposed analysis and synthesis methods have been rigorously validated through experimental evaluations, confirming their effectiveness.

Title: Erasing Noise in Signal Detection with Diffusion Model: From Theory to Application
Authors: Xiucheng Wang, Peilin Zheng, Nan Cheng
Abstract: In this paper, a signal detection method based on the denoise diffusion model (DM) is proposed, which outperforms the maximum likelihood (ML) estimation method that has long been regarded as the optimal signal detection technique. Theoretically, a novel mathematical theory for intelligent signal detection based on stochastic differential equations (SDEs) is established in this paper, demonstrating the effectiveness of DM in reducing the additive white Gaussian noise in received signals. Moreover, a mathematical relationship between the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and the timestep in DM is established, revealing that for any given SNR, a corresponding optimal timestep can be identified. Furthermore, to address potential issues with out-of-distribution inputs in the DM, we employ a mathematical scaling technique that allows the trained DM to handle signal detection across a wide range of SNRs without any fine-tuning. Building on the above theoretical foundation, we propose a DM-based signal detection method, with the diffusion transformer (DiT) serving as the backbone neural network, whose computational complexity of this method is $\mathcal{O}(n^2)$. Simulation results demonstrate that, for BPSK and QAM modulation schemes, the DM-based method achieves a significantly lower symbol error rate (SER) compared to ML estimation, while maintaining a much lower computational complexity.

Title: Effective DoF-Oriented Optimal Antenna Spacing in Near-Field XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Xianzhe Chen, Hong Ren, Cunhua Pan, Zhangjie Peng, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: This letter investigates the optimal antenna spacing for a near-field XL-MIMO communication system from the perspective of the array gain. Specifically, using the Green's function-based channel model, the letter analyzes the channel capacity, which is related to the effective degrees-of-freedom (EDoF). Then, the letter further investigates the applicability of two EDoF estimation methods. To increase EDoF, this letter focuses on analyzing the impact of antenna spacing. Furthermore, from the perspective of the array gain, the letter derives an approximate closed-form expression of the optimal antenna spacing, at which EDoF is maximized and the array gain at the antenna nearest to the focused antenna of the transmit array becomes zero. Finally, numerical results verify the main results of this letter.

Title: Reducing Latency by Eliminating CSIT Feedback: FDD Downlink MIMO Precoding Without CSIT Feedback for Internet-of-Things Communications
Authors: Juntaek Han, Namhyun Kim, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for low-latency frequency division duplex (FDD) multi-input multi-output (MIMO) transmission with Internet of Things (IoT) communications. Our key idea is eliminating feedback associated with downlink channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) acquisition. Instead, we propose to reconstruct downlink CSIT from uplink reference signals by exploiting the frequency invariance property on channel parameters. Nonetheless, the frequency disparity between the uplink and downlink makes it impossible to get perfect downlink CSIT, resulting in substantial interference. To address this, we formulate a max-min fairness problem and propose a rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA)-aided efficient precoding method. In particular, to fully harness the potential benefits of RSMA, we propose a method that approximates the error covariance matrix and incorporates it into the precoder optimization process. This approach effectively accounts for the impact of imperfect CSIT, enabling the design of a robust precoder that efficiently handles CSIT inaccuracies. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms other baseline methods in terms of the minimum spectral efficiency when no direct CSI feedback is used. Moreover, we show that our framework significantly reduces communication latency compared to conventional CSI feedback-based methods, underscoring its effectiveness in enhancing latency performance for IoT communications.

Title: MSV-Mamba: A Multiscale Vision Mamba Network for Echocardiography Segmentation
Authors: Xiaoxian Yang, Qi Wang, Kaiqi Zhang, Ke Wei, Jun Lyu, Lingchao Chen
Abstract: Ultrasound imaging frequently encounters challenges, such as those related to elevated noise levels, diminished spatiotemporal resolution, and the complexity of anatomical structures. These factors significantly hinder the model's ability to accurately capture and analyze structural relationships and dynamic patterns across various regions of the heart. Mamba, an emerging model, is one of the most cutting-edge approaches that is widely applied to diverse vision and language tasks. To this end, this paper introduces a U-shaped deep learning model incorporating a large-window Mamba scale (LMS) module and a hierarchical feature fusion approach for echocardiographic segmentation. First, a cascaded residual block serves as an encoder and is employed to incrementally extract multiscale detailed features. Second, a large-window multiscale mamba module is integrated into the decoder to capture global dependencies across regions and enhance the segmentation capability for complex anatomical structures. Furthermore, our model introduces auxiliary losses at each decoder layer and employs a dual attention mechanism to fuse multilayer features both spatially and across channels. This approach enhances segmentation performance and accuracy in delineating complex anatomical structures. Finally, the experimental results using the EchoNet-Dynamic and CAMUS datasets demonstrate that the model outperforms other methods in terms of both accuracy and robustness. For the segmentation of the left ventricular endocardium (${LV}_{endo}$), the model achieved optimal values of 95.01 and 93.36, respectively, while for the left ventricular epicardium (${LV}_{epi}$), values of 87.35 and 87.80, respectively, were achieved. This represents an improvement ranging between 0.54 and 1.11 compared with the best-performing model.

Title: A Federated Deep Learning Framework for Cell-Free RSMA Networks
Authors: S. Ali Mousavi, Mehdi Monemi, Reza Mohseni, Matti Latva-aho
Abstract: Next-generation wireless networks are poised to benefit significantly from the integration of three key technologies (KTs): Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA), cell-free architectures, and federated learning. Each of these technologies offers distinct advantages in terms of security, robustness, and distributed structure. In this paper, we propose a novel cell-free network architecture that incorporates RSMA and employs machine learning techniques within a federated framework. This combination leverages the strengths of each KT, creating a synergistic effect that maximizes the benefits of security, robustness, and distributed structure. We formally formulate the access point (AP) selection and precoder design for max-min rate optimization in a cell-free MIMO RSMA network. Our proposed solution scheme involves a three-block procedure. The first block trains deep reinforcement learning (DRL) neural networks to obtain RSMA precoders, assuming full connectivity between APs and user equipments (UEs). The second block uses these precoders and principal component analysis (PCA) to assign APs to UEs by removing a subset of AP-UE connections. The final block fine-tunes the RSMA precoders by incorporating the associated APs into a second DRL network. To leverage the distributed nature of the cell-free network, this process is implemented in a Federated Deep Reinforcement Learning (FDRL) structure operating through the cooperation of APs and a central processing unit (CPU). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed FDRL approach performs comparably to a benchmark centralized DRL scheme. Our FDRL approach, provides a balanced trade-off, maintaining high performance with enhanced security and reduced processing demands.

Title: QoE-oriented Communication Service Provision for Annotation Rendering in Mobile Augmented Reality
Authors: Lulu Sun, Conghao Zhou, Shisheng Hu, Yupeng Zhu, Nan Cheng, Xu (Tony)Xia
Abstract: As mobile augmented reality (MAR) continues to evolve, future 6G networks will play a pivotal role in supporting immersive and personalized user experiences. In this paper, we address the communication service provision problem for annotation rendering in edge-assisted MAR, with the objective of optimizing spectrum resource utilization while ensuring the required quality of experience (QoE) for MAR users. To overcome the challenges of user-specific uplink data traffic patterns and the complex operational mechanisms of annotation rendering, we propose a digital twin (DT)-based approach. We first design a DT specifically tailored for MAR applications to learn key annotation rendering mechanisms, enabling the network controller to access MAR application-specific information. Then, we develop a DT based QoE modeling approach to capture the unique relationship between individual user QoE and spectrum resource demands. Finally, we propose a QoE-oriented resource allocation algorithm that decreases resource utilization compared to conventional net work slicing-based approaches. Simulation results demonstrate that our DT-based approach outperforms benchmark approaches in the accuracy and granularity of QoE modeling.

Title: Real-time Mode-Aware Dataflow: A Dataflow Model to Specify and Analyze Mode-dependent CPSs under Relaxed Timing Constraints
Authors: Guillaume Roumage (LCYL), Selma Azaiez (CEA), Cyril Faure (LCYL), Stéphane Louise (LCYL)
Abstract: Modern Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) often exhibit both relaxed real-time constraints and a mode-dependent execution. Relaxed real-time constraints mean that only a subset of the processes of a CPS have real-time constraints, and a mode-dependent CPS has conditional execution branches. Static analysis tools, such as the PolyGraph model (a formalism extending the Cyclo-Static Dataflow model with real-time constraints), can specify and analyze systems with relaxed real-time constraints. However, PolyGraph is limited in its ability to specify and analyze mode-dependent CPSs. This paper extends PolyGraph with routing actors, yielding the Routed PolyGraph model. This model is further extended to the Real-time Mode-Aware Dataflow (RMDF), which both leverages routing actors and incorporates a new dataflow actor to specify mode-dependent CPSs under relaxed real-time constraints. This paper also extends the static analyses of PolyGraph to RMDF. We showcase the application of RMDF with a specification and an analysis (derivation of timing constraints at the job-level and a feasibility test) of the vision processing system of the Ingenuity Mars helicopter.

Title: Microphone Array Signal Processing and Deep Learning for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Reinhold Haeb-Umbach, Tomohiro Nakatani, Marc Delcroix, Christoph Boeddeker, Tsubasa Ochiai
Abstract: Multi-channel acoustic signal processing is a well-established and powerful tool to exploit the spatial diversity between a target signal and non-target or noise sources for signal enhancement. However, the textbook solutions for optimal data-dependent spatial filtering rest on the knowledge of second-order statistical moments of the signals, which have traditionally been difficult to acquire. In this contribution, we compare model-based, purely data-driven, and hybrid approaches to parameter estimation and filtering, where the latter tries to combine the benefits of model-based signal processing and data-driven deep learning to overcome their individual deficiencies. We illustrate the underlying design principles with examples from noise reduction, source separation, and dereverberation.

Title: Interpretable machine-learning for predicting molecular weight of PLA based on artificial bee colony optimization algorithm and adaptive neurofuzzy inference system
Authors: Amir Pouya Masoumi, Leo Creedon, Ramen Ghosh, Nimra Munir, Ross McMorrow, Marion McAfee
Abstract: This article discusses the integration of the Artificial Bee Colony (ABC) algorithm with two supervised learning methods, namely Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) and Adaptive Network-based Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS), for feature selection from Near-Infrared (NIR) spectra for predicting the molecular weight of medical-grade Polylactic Acid (PLA). During extrusion processing of PLA, in-line NIR spectra were captured along with extrusion process and machine setting data. With a dataset comprising 63 observations and 512 input features, appropriate machine learning tools are essential for interpreting data and selecting features to improve prediction accuracy. Initially, the ABC optimization algorithm is coupled with ANN/ANFIS to forecast PLA molecular weight. The objective functions of the ABC algorithm are to minimize the root mean square error (RMSE) between experimental and predicted PLA molecular weights while also minimizing the number of input features. Results indicate that employing ABC-ANFIS yields the lowest RMSE of 282 Da and identifies four significant parameters (NIR wavenumbers 6158 cm-1, 6310 cm-1, 6349 cm-1, and melt temperature) for prediction. These findings demonstrate the effectiveness of using the ABC algorithm with ANFIS for selecting a minimal set of features to predict PLA molecular weight with high accuracy during processing

Title: Implicit Neural Representations for Registration of Left Ventricle Myocardium During a Cardiac Cycle
Authors: Mathias Micheelsen Lowes, Jonas Jalili Pedersen, Bjørn S. Hansen, Klaus Fuglsang Kofoed, Maxime Sermesant, Rasmus R. Paulsen
Abstract: Understanding the movement of the left ventricle myocardium (LVmyo) during the cardiac cycle is essential for assessing cardiac function. One way to model this movement is through a series of deformable image registrations (DIRs) of the LVmyo. Traditional deep learning methods for DIRs, such as those based on convolutional neural networks, often require substantial memory and computational resources. In contrast, implicit neural representations (INRs) offer an efficient approach by operating on any number of continuous points. This study extends the use of INRs for DIR to cardiac computed tomography (CT), focusing on LVmyo registration. To enhance the precision of the registration around the LVmyo, we incorporate the signed distance field of the LVmyo with the Hounsfield Unit values from the CT frames. This guides the registration of the LVmyo, while keeping the tissue information from the CT frames. Our framework demonstrates high registration accuracy and provides a robust method for temporal registration that facilitates further analysis of LVmyo motion.

Title: Dual-Function Beamforming Design For Multi-Target Localization and Reliable Communications
Authors: Bo Tang, Da Li, Wenjun Wu, Astha Saini, Prabhu Babu, Petre Stoica
Abstract: This paper investigates the transmit beamforming design for multiple-input multiple-output systems to support both multi-target localization and multi-user communications. To enhance the target localization performance, we derive the asymptotic Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for target angle estimation by assuming that the receive array is linear and uniform. Then we formulate a beamforming design problem based on minimizing an upper bound on the asymptotic CRB (which is shown to be equivalent to {maximizing} the harmonic mean of the weighted beampattern responses at the target directions). Moreover, we impose a constraint on the SINR of each received communication signal to guarantee reliable communication performance. Two iterative algorithms are derived to tackle the non-convex design problem: one is based on the alternating direction method of multipliers, and the other uses the majorization-minimization technique to solve an equivalent minimax problem. Numerical results show that, through elaborate dual-function beamforming matrix design, the proposed algorithms can simultaneously achieve superior angle estimation performance as well as high-quality multi-user communications.

Title: An Extended Survey and a Comparison Framework for Dataflow Models of Computation and Communication
Authors: Guillaume Roumage (LCYL), Selma Azaiez (CEA), Cyril Faure (LCYL), Stéphane Louise (LCYL)
Abstract: Dataflow Model of Computation and Communications (DF MoCCs) is a formalism used to specify the behavior of Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs). DF MoCCs are widely used in the design of CPSs, as they provide a high-level of abstraction to specify the system's behavior. DF MoCCs rules give semantics to a dataflow specification of a CPS, and static analysis algorithms rely on these semantics to guarantee safety properties of the dataflow specification, such as bounded memory usage and deadlock freeness. A wide range of DF MoCCs exists, each with its own characteristics and static analyses. This paper presents a survey of those DF MoCCs and a classification in eight categories. In addition, DF MoCCs are characterized by a comprehensive list of features and static analyses, which reflect their expressiveness and analyzability. Based on this characterization, a framework is proposed to compare the expressiveness and the analyzability of DF MoCCs quantitatively.

Title: Synesthesia of Machines Based Multi-Modal Intelligent V2V Channel Model
Authors: Zengrui Han, Lu Bai, Ziwei Huang, Xiang Cheng
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel sixth-generation (6G) multi-modal intelligent vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) channel model from light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds based on Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To explore the mapping relationship between physical environment and electromagnetic space, a new V2V high-fidelity mixed sensing-communication integration simulation dataset with different vehicular traffic densities (VTDs) is constructed. Based on the constructed dataset, a novel scatterer recognition (ScaR) algorithm utilizing neural network SegNet is developed to recognize scatterer spatial attributes from LiDAR point clouds via SoM. In the developed ScaR algorithm, the mapping relationship between LiDAR point clouds and scatterers is explored, where the distribution of scatterers is obtained in the form of grid maps. Furthermore, scatterers are distinguished into dynamic and static scatterers based on LiDAR point cloud features, where parameters, e.g., distance, angle, and number, related to scatterers are determined. Through ScaR, dynamic and static scatterers change with the variation of LiDAR point clouds over time, which precisely models channel non-stationarity and consistency under different VTDs. Some important channel statistical properties, such as time-frequency correlation function (TF-CF) and Doppler power spectral density (DPSD), are obtained. Simulation results match well with ray-tracing (RT)-based results, thus demonstrating the necessity of exploring the mapping relationship and the utility of the proposed model.

Title: Bigger Isn't Always Better: Towards a General Prior for Medical Image Reconstruction
Authors: Lukas Glaszner, Martin Zach
Abstract: Diffusion model have been successfully applied to many inverse problems, including MRI and CT reconstruction. Researchers typically re-purpose models originally designed for unconditional sampling without modifications. Using two different posterior sampling algorithms, we show empirically that such large networks are not necessary. Our smallest model, effectively a ResNet, performs almost as good as an attention U-Net on in-distribution reconstruction, while being significantly more robust towards distribution shifts. Furthermore, we introduce models trained on natural images and demonstrate that they can be used in both MRI and CT reconstruction, out-performing model trained on medical images in out-of-distribution cases. As a result of our findings, we strongly caution against simply re-using very large networks and encourage researchers to adapt the model complexity to the respective task. Moreover, we argue that a key step towards a general diffusion-based prior is training on natural images.

Title: SynthSoM: A synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM)
Authors: Xiang Cheng, Ziwei Huang, Yong Yu, Lu Bai, Mingran Sun, Zengrui Han, Ruide Zhang, Sijiang Li
Abstract: Given the importance of datasets for sensing-communication integration research, a novel simulation platform for constructing communication and multi-modal sensory dataset is developed. The developed platform integrates three high-precision software, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Wireless InSite, and further achieves in-depth integration and precise alignment of them. Based on the developed platform, a new synthetic intelligent multi-modal sensing-communication dataset for Synesthesia of Machines (SoM), named SynthSoM, is proposed. The SynthSoM dataset contains various air-ground multi-link cooperative scenarios with comprehensive conditions, including multiple weather conditions, times of the day, intelligent agent densities, frequency bands, and antenna types. The SynthSoM dataset encompasses multiple data modalities, including radio-frequency (RF) channel large-scale and small-scale fading data, RF millimeter wave (mmWave) radar sensory data, and non-RF sensory data, e.g., RGB images, depth maps, and light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds. The quality of SynthSoM dataset is validated via statistics-based qualitative inspection and evaluation metrics through machine learning (ML) via real-world measurements. The SynthSoM dataset is open-sourced and provides consistent data for cross-comparing SoM-related algorithms.

Title: Computing Safety Margins of Parameterized Nonlinear Systems for Vulnerability Assessment via Trajectory Sensitivities
Authors: Michael W. Fisher
Abstract: Physical systems experience nonlinear disturbances which have the potential to disrupt desired behavior. For a particular disturbance, whether or not the system recovers from the disturbance to a desired stable equilibrium point depends on system parameter values, which are typically uncertain and time-varying. Therefore, to quantify proximity to vulnerability we define the safety margin to be the smallest change in parameter values from a nominal value such that the system will no longer be able to recover from the disturbance. Safety margins are valuable but challenging to compute as related methods, such as those for robust region of attraction estimation, are often either overly conservative or computationally intractable for high dimensional systems. Recently, we developed algorithms to compute safety margins efficiently and non-conservatively by exploiting the large sensitivity of the system trajectory near the region of attraction boundary to small perturbations. Although these algorithms have enjoyed empirical success, they lack theoretical guarantees that would ensure their generalizability. This work develops a novel characterization of safety margins in terms of trajectory sensitivities, and uses this to derive well-posedness and convergence guarantees for these algorithms, enabling their generalizability and successful application to a large class of nonlinear systems.

Title: Determining Disturbance Recovery Conditions by Inverse Sensitivity Minimization
Authors: Michael W. Fisher, Ian A. Hiskens
Abstract: Power systems naturally experience disturbances, some of which can damage equipment and disrupt consumers. It is important to quickly assess the likely consequences of credible disturbances and take preventive action, if necessary. However, assessing the impact of potential disturbances is challenging because many of the influential factors, such as loading patterns, controller settings and load dynamics, are not precisely known. To address this issue, the paper introduces the concept of parameter-space recovery regions. For each disturbance, the corresponding recovery region is the region of parameter space for which the system will recover to the desired operating point. The boundary of the recovery region establishes the separation between parameter values that result in trouble-free recovery and those that incur undesirable non-recovery. The safety margin for a given set of parameter values is defined as the smallest distance (in parameter space) between the given values and the recovery boundary. Novel numerical algorithms with theoretical guarantees are presented for efficiently computing recovery boundaries and safety margins. Unlike prior methods, which tend to be overly conservative and restricted to low dimensional parameter space, these methods compute safety margins to arbitrary user-specified accuracy and do so efficiently in high dimensional parameter space. The efficacy of the methods is demonstrated using the IEEE 39-bus benchmark power system, where safety margins are computed for cases that consider up to 86 parameters, and reveal unexpected safety implications that would not have been observed otherwise.

Title: Completing Sets of Prototype Transfer Functions for Subspace-based Direction of Arrival Estimation of Multiple Speakers
Authors: Daniel Fejgin, Simon Doclo
Abstract: To estimate the direction of arrival (DOA) of multiple speakers, subspace-based prototype transfer function matching methods such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC) or relative transfer function (RTF) vector matching are commonly employed. In general, these methods require calibrated microphone arrays, which are characterized by a known array geometry or a set of known prototype transfer functions for several directions. In this paper, we consider a partially calibrated microphone array, composed of a calibrated binaural hearing aid and a (non-calibrated) external microphone at an unknown location with no available set of prototype transfer functions. We propose a procedure for completing sets of prototype transfer functions by exploiting the orthogonality of subspaces, allowing to apply matching-based DOA estimation methods with partially calibrated microphone arrays. For the MUSIC and RTF vector matching methods, experimental results for two speakers in noisy and reverberant environments clearly demonstrate that for all locations of the external microphone DOAs can be estimated more accurately with completed sets of prototype transfer functions than with incomplete sets. \c{opyright}20XX IEEE.

Authors: Xinger Li, Zhiqiang Zhong, Bo Huang, Yang Yang
Abstract: This paper is the first-place solution for ICASSP MEIJU@2025 Track I, which focuses on low-resource multimodal emotion and intention recognition. How to effectively utilize a large amount of unlabeled data, while ensuring the mutual promotion of different difficulty levels tasks in the interaction stage, these two points become the key to the competition. In this paper, pseudo-label labeling is carried out on the model trained with labeled data, and samples with high confidence and their labels are selected to alleviate the problem of low resources. At the same time, the characteristic of easy represented ability of intention recognition found in the experiment is used to make mutually promote with emotion recognition under different attention heads, and higher performance of intention recognition is achieved through fusion. Finally, under the refined processing data, we achieve the score of 0.5532 in the Test set, and win the championship of the track.

Title: BEN: Using Confidence-Guided Matting for Dichotomous Image Segmentation
Authors: Maxwell Meyer, Jack Spruyt
Abstract: Current approaches to dichotomous image segmentation (DIS) treat image matting and object segmentation as fundamentally different tasks. As improvements in image segmentation become increasingly challenging to achieve, combining image matting and grayscale segmentation techniques offers promising new directions for architectural innovation. Inspired by the possibility of aligning these two model tasks, we propose a new architectural approach for DIS called Confidence-Guided Matting (CGM). We created the first CGM model called Background Erase Network (BEN). BEN is comprised of two components: BEN Base for initial segmentation and BEN Refiner for confidence refinement. Our approach achieves substantial improvements over current state-of-the-art methods on the DIS5K validation dataset, demonstrating that matting-based refinement can significantly enhance segmentation quality. This work opens new possibilities for cross-pollination between matting and segmentation techniques in computer vision.

Title: Towards smart and adaptive agents for active sensing on edge devices
Authors: Devendra Vyas, Miguel de Prado, Tim Verbelen
Abstract: TinyML has made deploying deep learning models on low-power edge devices feasible, creating new opportunities for real-time perception in constrained environments. However, the adaptability of such deep learning methods remains limited to data drift adaptation, lacking broader capabilities that account for the environment's underlying dynamics and inherent uncertainty. Deep learning's scaling laws, which counterbalance this limitation by massively up-scaling data and model size, cannot be applied when deploying on the Edge, where deep learning limitations are further amplified as models are scaled down for deployment on resource-constrained devices. This paper presents a smart agentic system capable of performing on-device perception and planning, enabling active sensing on the edge. By incorporating active inference into our solution, our approach extends beyond deep learning capabilities, allowing the system to plan in dynamic environments while operating in real time with a modest total model size of 2.3 MB. We showcase our proposed system by creating and deploying a saccade agent connected to an IoT camera with pan and tilt capabilities on an NVIDIA Jetson embedded device. The saccade agent controls the camera's field of view following optimal policies derived from the active inference principles, simulating human-like saccadic motion for surveillance and robotics applications.

Title: PROEMO: Prompt-Driven Text-to-Speech Synthesis Based on Emotion and Intensity Control
Authors: Shaozuo Zhang, Ambuj Mehrish, Yingting Li, Soujanya Poria
Abstract: Speech synthesis has significantly advanced from statistical methods to deep neural network architectures, leading to various text-to-speech (TTS) models that closely mimic human speech patterns. However, capturing nuances such as emotion and style in speech synthesis is challenging. To address this challenge, we introduce an approach centered on prompt-based emotion control. The proposed architecture incorporates emotion and intensity control across multi-speakers. Furthermore, we leverage large language models (LLMs) to manipulate speech prosody while preserving linguistic content. Using embedding emotional cues, regulating intensity levels, and guiding prosodic variations with prompts, our approach infuses synthesized speech with human-like expressiveness and variability. Lastly, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through a systematic exploration of the control mechanisms mentioned above.

Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and multimodal speech-text models have laid the groundwork for seamless voice interactions, enabling real-time, natural, and human-like conversations. Previous models for voice interactions are categorized as native and aligned. Native models integrate speech and text processing in one framework but struggle with issues like differing sequence lengths and insufficient pre-training. Aligned models maintain text LLM capabilities but are often limited by small datasets and a narrow focus on speech tasks. In this work, we introduce MinMo, a Multimodal Large Language Model with approximately 8B parameters for seamless voice interaction. We address the main limitations of prior aligned multimodal models. We train MinMo through multiple stages of speech-to-text alignment, text-to-speech alignment, speech-to-speech alignment, and duplex interaction alignment, on 1.4 million hours of diverse speech data and a broad range of speech tasks. After the multi-stage training, MinMo achieves state-of-the-art performance across various benchmarks for voice comprehension and generation while maintaining the capabilities of text LLMs, and also facilitates full-duplex conversation, that is, simultaneous two-way communication between the user and the system. Moreover, we propose a novel and simple voice decoder that outperforms prior models in voice generation. The enhanced instruction-following capabilities of MinMo supports controlling speech generation based on user instructions, with various nuances including emotions, dialects, and speaking rates, and mimicking specific voices. For MinMo, the speech-to-text latency is approximately 100ms, full-duplex latency is approximately 600ms in theory and 800ms in practice. The MinMo project web page is this https URL, and the code and models will be released soon.

Title: On How Traffic Signals Impact the Fundamental Diagrams of Urban Roads
Authors: Chao Zhang, Yechen Li, Neha Arora, Carolina Osorio
Abstract: Being widely adopted by the transportation and planning practitioners, the fundamental diagram (FD) is the primary tool used to relate the key macroscopic traffic variables of speed, flow, and density. We empirically analyze the relation between vehicular space-mean speeds and flows given different signal settings and postulate a parsimonious parametric function form of the traditional FD where its function parameters are explicitly modeled as a function of the signal plan factors. We validate the proposed formulation using data from signalized urban road segments in Salt Lake City, Utah, USA. The proposed formulation builds our understanding of how changes to signal settings impact the FDs, and more generally the congestion patterns, of signalized urban segments.

Title: On Creating A Brain-To-Text Decoder
Authors: Zenon Lamprou, Yashar Moshfeghi
Abstract: Brain decoding has emerged as a rapidly advancing and extensively utilized technique within neuroscience. This paper centers on the application of raw electroencephalogram (EEG) signals for decoding human brain activity, offering a more expedited and efficient methodology for enhancing our understanding of the human brain. The investigation specifically scrutinizes the efficacy of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) in deciphering neural signals associated with speech production, with particular emphasis on the impact of vocabulary size, electrode density, and training data on the framework's performance. The study reveals the competitive word error rates (WERs) achievable on the Librispeech benchmark through pre-training on unlabelled data for speech processing. Furthermore, the study evaluates the efficacy of voice recognition under configurations with limited labeled data, surpassing previous state-of-the-art techniques while utilizing significantly fewer labels. Additionally, the research provides a comprehensive analysis of error patterns in voice recognition and the influence of model size and unlabelled training data. It underscores the significance of factors such as vocabulary size and electrode density in enhancing BCI performance, advocating for an increase in microelectrodes and refinement of language models.

Title: Over-the-Air FEEL with Integrated Sensing: Joint Scheduling and Beamforming Design
Authors: Saba Asaad, Ping Wang, Hina Tabassum
Abstract: Employing wireless systems with dual sensing and communications functionalities is becoming critical in next generation of wireless networks. In this paper, we propose a robust design for over-the-air federated edge learning (OTA-FEEL) that leverages sensing capabilities at the parameter server (PS) to mitigate the impact of target echoes on the analog model aggregation. We first derive novel expressions for the Cramer-Rao bound of the target response and mean squared error (MSE) of the estimated global model to measure radar sensing and model aggregation quality, respectively. Then, we develop a joint scheduling and beamforming framework that optimizes the OTA-FEEL performance while keeping the sensing and communication quality, determined respectively in terms of Cramer-Rao bound and achievable downlink rate, in a desired range. The resulting scheduling problem reduces to a combinatorial mixed-integer nonlinear programming problem (MINLP). We develop a low-complexity hierarchical method based on the matching pursuit algorithm used widely for sparse recovery in the literature of compressed sensing. The proposed algorithm uses a step-wise strategy to omit the least effective devices in each iteration based on a metric that captures both the aggregation and sensing quality of the system. It further invokes alternating optimization scheme to iteratively update the downlink beamforming and uplink post-processing by marginally optimizing them in each iteration. Convergence and complexity analysis of the proposed algorithm is presented. Numerical evaluations on MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm. The results show that by leveraging accurate sensing, the target echoes on the uplink signal can be effectively suppressed, ensuring the quality of model aggregation to remain intact despite the interference.

Title: MEt3R: Measuring Multi-View Consistency in Generated Images
Authors: Mohammad Asim, Christopher Wewer, Thomas Wimmer, Bernt Schiele, Jan Eric Lenssen
Abstract: We introduce MEt3R, a metric for multi-view consistency in generated images. Large-scale generative models for multi-view image generation are rapidly advancing the field of 3D inference from sparse observations. However, due to the nature of generative modeling, traditional reconstruction metrics are not suitable to measure the quality of generated outputs and metrics that are independent of the sampling procedure are desperately needed. In this work, we specifically address the aspect of consistency between generated multi-view images, which can be evaluated independently of the specific scene. Our approach uses DUSt3R to obtain dense 3D reconstructions from image pairs in a feed-forward manner, which are used to warp image contents from one view into the other. Then, feature maps of these images are compared to obtain a similarity score that is invariant to view-dependent effects. Using MEt3R, we evaluate the consistency of a large set of previous methods for novel view and video generation, including our open, multi-view latent diffusion model.

Title: Event Constrained Programming
Authors: Daniel Ovalle, Stefan Mazzadi, Carl D. Laird, Ignacio E. Grossmann, Joshua L. Pulsipher
Abstract: In this paper, we present event constraints as a new modeling paradigm that generalizes joint chance constraints from stochastic optimization to (1) enforce a constraint on the probability of satisfying a set of constraints aggregated via application-specific logic (constituting an event) and (2) to be applied to general infinite-dimensional optimization (InfiniteOpt) problems (i.e., time, space, and/or uncertainty domains). This new constraint class offers significant modeling flexibility in posing InfiniteOpt constraints that are enforced over a certain portion of their domain (e.g., to a certain probability level), but can be challenging to reformulate/solve due to difficulties in representing arbitrary logical conditions and specifying a probabilistic measure on a collection of constraints. To address these challenges, we derive a generalized disjunctive programming (GDP) representation of event constrained optimization problems, which readily enables us to pose logical event conditions in a standard form and allows us to draw from a suite of GDP solution strategies that leverage the special structure of this problem class. We also extend several approximation techniques from the chance constraint literature to provide a means to reformulate certain event constraints without the use of binary variables. We illustrate these findings with case studies in stochastic optimal power flow, dynamic disease control, and optimal 2D diffusion.

Title: Unispeaker: A Unified Approach for Multimodality-driven Speaker Generation
Authors: Zhengyan Sheng, Zhihao Du, Heng Lu, Shiliang Zhang, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Recent advancements in personalized speech generation have brought synthetic speech increasingly close to the realism of target speakers' recordings, yet multimodal speaker generation remains on the rise. This paper introduces UniSpeaker, a unified approach for multimodality-driven speaker generation. Specifically, we propose a unified voice aggregator based on KV-Former, applying soft contrastive loss to map diverse voice description modalities into a shared voice space, ensuring that the generated voice aligns more closely with the input descriptions. To evaluate multimodality-driven voice control, we build the first multimodality-based voice control (MVC) benchmark, focusing on voice suitability, voice diversity, and speech quality. UniSpeaker is evaluated across five tasks using the MVC benchmark, and the experimental results demonstrate that UniSpeaker outperforms previous modality-specific models. Speech samples are available at \url{this https URL}.

Title: UCloudNet: A Residual U-Net with Deep Supervision for Cloud Image Segmentation
Authors: Yijie Li, Hewei Wang, Shaofan Wang, Yee Hui Lee, Muhammad Salman Pathan, Soumyabrata Dev
Abstract: Recent advancements in meteorology involve the use of ground-based sky cameras for cloud observation. Analyzing images from these cameras helps in calculating cloud coverage and understanding atmospheric phenomena. Traditionally, cloud image segmentation relied on conventional computer vision techniques. However, with the advent of deep learning, convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are increasingly applied for this purpose. Despite their effectiveness, CNNs often require many epochs to converge, posing challenges for real-time processing in sky camera systems. In this paper, we introduce a residual U-Net with deep supervision for cloud segmentation which provides better accuracy than previous approaches, and with less training consumption. By utilizing residual connection in encoders of UCloudNet, the feature extraction ability is further improved.

Title: NVS-SQA: Exploring Self-Supervised Quality Representation Learning for Neurally Synthesized Scenes without References
Authors: Qiang Qu, Yiran Shen, Xiaoming Chen, Yuk Ying Chung, Weidong Cai, Tongliang Liu
Abstract: Neural View Synthesis (NVS), such as NeRF and 3D Gaussian Splatting, effectively creates photorealistic scenes from sparse viewpoints, typically evaluated by quality assessment methods like PSNR, SSIM, and LPIPS. However, these full-reference methods, which compare synthesized views to reference views, may not fully capture the perceptual quality of neurally synthesized scenes (NSS), particularly due to the limited availability of dense reference views. Furthermore, the challenges in acquiring human perceptual labels hinder the creation of extensive labeled datasets, risking model overfitting and reduced generalizability. To address these issues, we propose NVS-SQA, a NSS quality assessment method to learn no-reference quality representations through self-supervision without reliance on human labels. Traditional self-supervised learning predominantly relies on the "same instance, similar representation" assumption and extensive datasets. However, given that these conditions do not apply in NSS quality assessment, we employ heuristic cues and quality scores as learning objectives, along with a specialized contrastive pair preparation process to improve the effectiveness and efficiency of learning. The results show that NVS-SQA outperforms 17 no-reference methods by a large margin (i.e., on average 109.5% in SRCC, 98.6% in PLCC, and 91.5% in KRCC over the second best) and even exceeds 16 full-reference methods across all evaluation metrics (i.e., 22.9% in SRCC, 19.1% in PLCC, and 18.6% in KRCC over the second best).

Title: Neural Codec Source Tracing: Toward Comprehensive Attribution in Open-Set Condition
Authors: Yuankun Xie, Xiaopeng Wang, Zhiyong Wang, Ruibo Fu, Zhengqi Wen, Songjun Cao, Long Ma, Chenxing Li, Haonnan Cheng, Long Ye
Abstract: Current research in audio deepfake detection is gradually transitioning from binary classification to multi-class tasks, referred as audio deepfake source tracing task. However, existing studies on source tracing consider only closed-set scenarios and have not considered the challenges posed by open-set conditions. In this paper, we define the Neural Codec Source Tracing (NCST) task, which is capable of performing open-set neural codec classification and interpretable ALM detection. Specifically, we constructed the ST-Codecfake dataset for the NCST task, which includes bilingual audio samples generated by 11 state-of-the-art neural codec methods and ALM-based out-ofdistribution (OOD) test samples. Furthermore, we establish a comprehensive source tracing benchmark to assess NCST models in open-set conditions. The experimental results reveal that although the NCST models perform well in in-distribution (ID) classification and OOD detection, they lack robustness in classifying unseen real audio. The ST-codecfake dataset and code are available.

Title: Safe Circumnavigation of a Hostile Target Using Range-Based Measurements
Authors: Gaurav Singh Bhati, Arukonda Vaishnavi, Anoop Jain
Abstract: Robotic systems are frequently deployed in missions that are dull, dirty, and dangerous, where ensuring their safety is of paramount importance when designing stabilizing controllers to achieve their desired goals. This paper addresses the problem of safe circumnavigation around a hostile target by a nonholonomic robot, with the objective of maintaining a desired safe distance from the target. Our solution approach involves incorporating an auxiliary circle into the problem formulation, which assists in navigating the robot around the target using available range-based measurements. By leveraging the concept of a barrier Lyapunov function, we propose a novel control law that ensures stable circumnavigation around the target while preventing the robot from entering the safety circle. This controller is designed based on a parameter that depends on the radii of three circles, namely the stabilizing circle, the auxiliary circle, and the safety circle. By identifying an appropriate range for this design parameter, we rigorously prove the stability of the desired equilibrium of the closed-loop system. Additionally, we provide an analysis of the robot's motion within the auxiliary circle, which is influenced by a gain parameter in the proposed controller. Simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the key theoretical developments.

Title: Energy-Aware Resource Allocation for Energy Harvesting Powered Wireless Sensor Nodes
Authors: Ngoc M. Ngo, Trung T. Nguyen, Phuc H. Nguyen, Van-Dinh Nguyen
Abstract: Low harvested energy poses a significant challenge to sustaining continuous communication in energy harvesting (EH)-powered wireless sensor networks. This is mainly due to intermittent and limited power availability from radio frequency signals. In this paper, we introduce a novel energy-aware resource allocation problem aimed at enabling the asynchronous accumulate-then-transmit protocol, offering an alternative to the extensively studied harvest-then-transmit approach. Specifically, we jointly optimize power allocation and time fraction dedicated to EH to maximize the average long-term system throughput, accounting for both data and energy queue lengths. By leveraging inner approximation and network utility maximization techniques, we develop a simple yet efficient iterative algorithm that guarantees at least a local optimum and achieves long-term utility improvement. Numerical results highlight the proposed approach's effectiveness in terms of both queue length and sustained system throughput.

Title: Optimizing wheel loader performance: an end-to-end approach
Authors: Koji Aoshima, Eddie Wadbro, Martin Servin
Abstract: Wheel loaders in mines and construction sites repeatedly load soil from a pile to load receivers. This task presents a challenging optimization problem since each loading's performance depends on the pile state, which depends on previous loadings. We investigate an end-to-end optimization approach considering future loading outcomes and V-cycle transportation costs. To predict the evolution of the pile state and the loading performance, we use world models that leverage deep neural networks trained on numerous simulated loading cycles. A look-ahead tree search optimizes the sequence of loading actions by evaluating the performance of thousands of action candidates, which expand into subsequent action candidates under the predicted pile states recursively. Test results demonstrate that, over a horizon of 15 sequential loadings, the look-ahead tree search is 6% more efficient than a greedy strategy, which always selects the action that maximizes the current single loading performance, and 14% more efficient than using a fixed loading controller optimized for the nominal case.

Abstract: The cumulative distribution function (CDF) is fundamental due to its ability to reveal information about random variables, making it essential in studies that require privacy-preserving methods to protect sensitive data. This paper introduces a novel privacy-preserving CDF method inspired by the functional analysis and functional mechanism. Our approach projects the empirical CDF into a predefined space, approximating it using specific functions, and protects the coefficients to achieve a differentially private empirical CDF. Compared to existing methods like histogram queries and adaptive quantiles, our method is preferable in decentralized settings and scenarios where CDFs must be updated with newly collected data.

Title: Theoretical Characterization of Effect of Masks in Snapshot Compressive Imaging
Authors: Mengyu Zhao, Shirin Jalali
Abstract: Snapshot compressive imaging (SCI) refers to the recovery of three-dimensional data cubes-such as videos or hyperspectral images-from their two-dimensional projections, which are generated by a special encoding of the data with a mask. SCI systems commonly use binary-valued masks that follow certain physical constraints. Optimizing these masks subject to these constraints is expected to improve system performance. However, prior theoretical work on SCI systems focuses solely on independently and identically distributed (i.i.d.) Gaussian masks, which do not permit such optimization. On the other hand, existing practical mask optimizations rely on computationally intensive joint optimizations that provide limited insight into the role of masks and are expected to be sub-optimal due to the non-convexity and complexity of the optimization. In this paper, we analytically characterize the performance of SCI systems employing binary masks and leverage our analysis to optimize hardware parameters. Our findings provide a comprehensive and fundamental understanding of the role of binary masks - with both independent and dependent elements - and their optimization. We also present simulation results that confirm our theoretical findings and further illuminate different aspects of mask design.

Title: Average Reward Reinforcement Learning for Wireless Radio Resource Management
Authors: Kun Yang, Jing Yang, Cong Shen
Abstract: In this paper, we address a crucial but often overlooked issue in applying reinforcement learning (RL) to radio resource management (RRM) in wireless communications: the mismatch between the discounted reward RL formulation and the undiscounted goal of wireless network optimization. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to systematically investigate this discrepancy, starting with a discussion of the problem formulation followed by simulations that quantify the extent of the gap. To bridge this gap, we introduce the use of average reward RL, a method that aligns more closely with the long-term objectives of RRM. We propose a new method called the Average Reward Off policy Soft Actor Critic (ARO SAC) is an adaptation of the well known Soft Actor Critic algorithm in the average reward framework. This new method achieves significant performance improvement our simulation results demonstrate a 15% gain in the system performance over the traditional discounted reward RL approach, underscoring the potential of average reward RL in enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of wireless network optimization.

Title: Hierarchical Sampling-based Planner with LTL Constraints and Text Prompting
Authors: Jingzhan Ge, Zi-Hao Zhang, Sheng-En Huang
Abstract: This project introduces a hierarchical planner integrating Linear Temporal Logic (LTL) constraints with natural language prompting for robot motion planning. The framework decomposes maps into regions, generates directed graphs, and converts them into transition systems for high-level planning. Text instructions are translated into LTL formulas and converted to Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA) for sequential goal-reaching tasks while adhering to safety constraints. High-level plans, derived via Breadth-First Search (BFS), guide low-level planners like Exploring Random Trees (RRT) and Probabilistic Roadmaps (PRM) for obstacle-avoidant navigation along with LTL tasks. The approach demonstrates adaptability to various task complexities, though challenges such as graph construction overhead and suboptimal path generation remain. Future directions include extending to considering terrain conditions and incorporating higher-order dynamics.

Title: Integrated Sensing and Edge AI: Realizing Intelligent Perception in 6G
Authors: Zhiyan Liu, Xu Chen, Hai Wu, Zhanwei Wang, Xianhao Chen, Dusit Niyato, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Sensing and edge artificial intelligence (AI) are envisioned as two essential and interconnected functions in sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. On the one hand, sensing-empowered applications rely on powerful AI models to extract features and understand semantics from ubiquitous wireless sensors. On the other hand, the massive amount of sensory data serves as the fuel to continuously refine edge AI models. This deep integration of sensing and edge AI has given rise to a new task-oriented paradigm known as integrated sensing and edge AI (ISEA), which features a holistic design approach to communication, AI computation, and sensing for optimal sensing-task performance. In this article, we present a comprehensive survey for ISEA. We first provide technical preliminaries for sensing, edge AI, and new communication paradigms in ISEA. Then, we study several use cases of ISEA to demonstrate its practical relevance and introduce current standardization and industrial progress. Next, the design principles, metrics, tradeoffs, and architectures of ISEA are established, followed by a thorough overview of ISEA techniques, including digital air interface, over-the-air computation, and advanced signal processing. Its interplay with various 6G advancements, e.g., new physical-layer and networking techniques, are presented. Finally, we present future research opportunities in ISEA, including the integration of foundation models, convergence of ISEA and integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), and ultra-low-latency ISEA.

Title: Enabling Cardiac Monitoring using In-ear Ballistocardiogram on COTS Wireless Earbuds
Authors: Yongjian Fu, Ke Sun, Ruyao Wang, Xinyi Li, Ju Ren, Yaoxue Zhang, Xinyu Zhang
Abstract: The human ear offers a unique opportunity for cardiac monitoring due to its physiological and practical advantages. However, existing earable solutions require additional hardware and complex processing, posing challenges for commercial True Wireless Stereo (TWS) earbuds which are limited by their form factor and resources. In this paper, we propose TWSCardio, a novel system that repurposes the IMU sensors in TWS earbuds for cardiac monitoring. Our key finding is that these sensors can capture in-ear ballistocardiogram (BCG) signals. TWSCardio reuses the unstable Bluetooth channel to stream the IMU data to a smartphone for BCG processing. It incorporates a signal enhancement framework to address issues related to missing data and low sampling rate, while mitigating motion artifacts by fusing multi-axis information. Furthermore, it employs a region-focused signal reconstruction method to translate the multi-axis in-ear BCG signals into fine-grained seismocardiogram (SCG) signals. We have implemented TWSCardio as an efficient real-time app. Our experiments on 100 subjects verify that TWSCardio can accurately reconstruct cardiac signals while showing resilience to motion artifacts, missing data, and low sampling rates. Our case studies further demonstrate that TWSCardio can support diverse cardiac monitoring applications.

Title: OFDM-based JCAS under Attack: The Dual Threat of Spoofing and Jamming in WLAN Sensing
Authors: Hasan Can Yildirim, Musa Furkan Keskin, Henk Wymeersch, Francois Horlin
Abstract: This study reveals the vulnerabilities of Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) sensing, under the scope of joint communication and sensing (JCAS), focusing on target spoofing and deceptive jamming techniques. We use orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) to explore how adversaries can exploit WLAN's sensing capabilities to inject false targets and disrupt normal operations. Unlike traditional methods that require sophisticated digital radio-frequency memory hardware, we demonstrate that much simpler software-defined radios can effectively serve as deceptive jammers in WLAN settings. Through comprehensive modeling and practical experiments, we show how deceptive jammers can manipulate the range-Doppler map (RDM) by altering signal integrity, thereby posing significant security threats to OFDM-based JCAS systems. Our findings comprehensively evaluate jammer impact on RDMs and propose several jamming strategies that vary in complexity and detectability.

Title: Evaluating unsupervised contrastive learning framework for MRI sequences classification
Authors: Yuli Wang, Kritika Iyer, Sep Farhand, Yoshihisa Shinagawa
Abstract: The automatic identification of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences can streamline clinical workflows by reducing the time radiologists spend manually sorting and identifying sequences, thereby enabling faster diagnosis and treatment planning for patients. However, the lack of standardization in the parameters of MRI scans poses challenges for automated systems and complicates the generation and utilization of datasets for machine learning research. To address this issue, we propose a system for MRI sequence identification using an unsupervised contrastive deep learning framework. By training a convolutional neural network based on the ResNet-18 architecture, our system classifies nine common MRI sequence types as a 9-class classification problem. The network was trained using an in-house internal dataset and validated on several public datasets, including BraTS, ADNI, Fused Radiology-Pathology Prostate Dataset, the Breast Cancer Dataset (ACRIN), among others, encompassing diverse acquisition protocols and requiring only 2D slices for training. Our system achieves a classification accuracy of over 0.95 across the nine most common MRI sequence types.

Title: Sanidha: A Studio Quality Multi-Modal Dataset for Carnatic Music
Authors: Venkatakrishnan Vaidyanathapuram Krishnan, Noel Alben, Anish Nair, Nathaniel Condit-Schultz
Abstract: Music source separation demixes a piece of music into its individual sound sources (vocals, percussion, melodic instruments, etc.), a task with no simple mathematical solution. It requires deep learning methods involving training on large datasets of isolated music stems. The most commonly available datasets are made from commercial Western music, limiting the models' applications to non-Western genres like Carnatic music. Carnatic music is a live tradition, with the available multi-track recordings containing overlapping sounds and bleeds between the sources. This poses a challenge to commercially available source separation models like Spleeter and Hybrid Demucs. In this work, we introduce 'Sanidha', the first open-source novel dataset for Carnatic music, offering studio-quality, multi-track recordings with minimal to no overlap or bleed. Along with the audio files, we provide high-definition videos of the artists' performances. Additionally, we fine-tuned Spleeter, one of the most commonly used source separation models, on our dataset and observed improved SDR performance compared to fine-tuning on a pre-existing Carnatic multi-track dataset. The outputs of the fine-tuned model with 'Sanidha' are evaluated through a listening study.

Title: Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network for Short Term Load Forecasting Across Diverse Consumers
Authors: Muhammad Umair Danish, Katarina Grolinger
Abstract: Load forecasting plays a crucial role in energy management, directly impacting grid stability, operational efficiency, cost reduction, and environmental sustainability. Traditional Vanilla Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) face issues such as vanishing and exploding gradients, whereas sophisticated RNNs such as LSTMs have shown considerable success in this domain. However, these models often struggle to accurately capture complex and sudden variations in energy consumption, and their applicability is typically limited to specific consumer types, such as offices or schools. To address these challenges, this paper proposes the Kolmogorov-Arnold Recurrent Network (KARN), a novel load forecasting approach that combines the flexibility of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks with RNN's temporal modeling capabilities. KARN utilizes learnable temporal spline functions and edge-based activations to better model non-linear relationships in load data, making it adaptable across a diverse range of consumer types. The proposed KARN model was rigorously evaluated on a variety of real-world datasets, including student residences, detached homes, a home with electric vehicle charging, a townhouse, and industrial buildings. Across all these consumer categories, KARN consistently outperformed traditional Vanilla RNNs, while it surpassed LSTM and Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) in six buildings. The results demonstrate KARN's superior accuracy and applicability, making it a promising tool for enhancing load forecasting in diverse energy management scenarios.

Title: Downlink OFDM-FAMA in 5G-NR Systems
Authors: Hanjiang Hong, Kai-Kit Wong, Hao Xu, Yin Xu, Hyundong Shin, Ross Murch, Dazhi He, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: Fluid antenna multiple access (FAMA), enabled by the fluid antenna system (FAS), offers a new and straightforward solution to massive connectivity. Previous results on FAMA were primarily based on narrowband channels. This paper studies the adoption of FAMA within the fifth-generation (5G) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) framework, referred to as OFDM-FAMA, and evaluate its performance in broadband multipath channels. We first design the OFDM-FAMA system, taking into account 5G channel coding and OFDM modulation. Then the system's achievable rate is analyzed, and an algorithm to approximate the FAS configuration at each user is proposed based on the rate. Extensive link-level simulation results reveal that OFDM-FAMA can significantly improve the multiplexing gain over the OFDM system with fixed-position antenna (FPA) users, especially when robust channel coding is applied and the number of radio-frequency (RF) chains at each user is small.

Title: TensorConvolutionPlus: A python package for distribution system flexibility area estimation
Authors: Demetris Chrysostomou, Jose Luis Rueda Torres, Jochen Lorenz Cremer
Abstract: Power system operators need new, efficient operational tools to use the flexibility of distributed resources and deal with the challenges of highly uncertain and variable power systems. Transmission system operators can consider the available flexibility in distribution systems (DSs) without breaching the DS constraints through flexibility areas. However, there is an absence of open-source packages for flexibility area estimation. This paper introduces TensorConvolutionPlus, a user-friendly Python-based package for flexibility area estimation. The main features of TensorConvolutionPlus include estimating flexibility areas using the TensorConvolution+ algorithm, the power flow-based algorithm, an exhaustive PF-based algorithm, and an optimal power flow-based algorithm. Additional features include adapting flexibility area estimations from different operating conditions and including flexibility service providers offering discrete setpoints of flexibility. The TensorConvolutionPlus package facilitates a broader adaptation of flexibility estimation algorithms by system operators and power system researchers.

Title: Beam Structured Turbo Receiver for HF Skywave Massive MIMO
Authors: Linfeng Song, Ding Shi, Xiqi Gao, Geoffrey Ye Li, Xiang-Gen Xia
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate receiver design for high frequency (HF) skywave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications. We first establish a modified beam based channel model (BBCM) by performing uniform sampling for directional cosine with deterministic sampling interval, where the beam matrix is constructed using a phase-shifted discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. Based on the modified BBCM, we propose a beam structured turbo receiver (BSTR) involving low-dimensional beam domain signal detection for grouped user terminals (UTs), which is proved to be asymptotically optimal in terms of minimizing mean-squared error (MSE). Moreover, we extend it to windowed BSTR by introducing a windowing approach for interference suppression and complexity reduction, and propose a well-designed energy-focusing window. We also present an efficient implementation of the windowed BSTR by exploiting the structure properties of the beam matrix and the beam domain channel sparsity. Simulation results validate the superior performance of the proposed receivers but with remarkably low complexity.

Title: Optimization with Multi-sourced Reference Information and Unknown Trust: A Distributionally Robust Approach
Authors: Yanru Guo, Ruiwei Jiang, Siqian Shen
Abstract: In problems that involve input parameter information gathered from multiple data sources with varying reliability, incorporating users' trust about different sources in decision-optimization models can potentially improve solution performance and reliability. In this work, we propose a novel multi-reference distributionally robust optimization (MR-DRO) framework, where the model inputs are uncertain and their probability distributions can be statistically inferred from multiple data sources. Via nonparametric data fusion, we construct a Wasserstein ambiguity set to minimize the worst-case expected value of a stochastic objective function, accounting for both uncertainty and unknown reliability of information sources. We reformulate the MR-DRO model as a linear program given linear objective and constraints in the original problem. We also incorporate a dynamic trust update mechanism that adjusts the trust for each source based on its performance over time. In addition, we introduce the concept of probability dominance to identify sources with dominant trust. Via solving instances of resource allocation and portfolio optimization, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the trust-informed MR-DRO approach compared to traditional optimization frameworks relying on a single data source. Our results highlight the significance of integrating (dynamic) user trust in decision making under uncertainty, particularly when given diverse and potentially conflicting input data.

Title: MathReader : Text-to-Speech for Mathematical Documents
Authors: Sieun Hyeon, Kyudan Jung, Nam-Joon Kim, Hyun Gon Ryu, Jaeyoung Do
Abstract: TTS (Text-to-Speech) document reader from Microsoft, Adobe, Apple, and OpenAI have been serviced worldwide. They provide relatively good TTS results for general plain text, but sometimes skip contents or provide unsatisfactory results for mathematical expressions. This is because most modern academic papers are written in LaTeX, and when LaTeX formulas are compiled, they are rendered as distinctive text forms within the document. However, traditional TTS document readers output only the text as it is recognized, without considering the mathematical meaning of the formulas. To address this issue, we propose MathReader, which effectively integrates OCR, a fine-tuned T5 model, and TTS. MathReader demonstrated a lower Word Error Rate (WER) than existing TTS document readers, such as Microsoft Edge and Adobe Acrobat, when processing documents containing mathematical formulas. MathReader reduced the WER from 0.510 to 0.281 compared to Microsoft Edge, and from 0.617 to 0.281 compared to Adobe Acrobat. This will significantly contribute to alleviating the inconvenience faced by users who want to listen to documents, especially those who are visually impaired.

Title: AdaCS: Adaptive Normalization for Enhanced Code-Switching ASR
Authors: The Chuong Chu, Vu Tuan Dat Pham, Kien Dao, Hoang Nguyen, Quoc Hung Truong
Abstract: Intra-sentential code-switching (CS) refers to the alternation between languages that happens within a single utterance and is a significant challenge for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. For example, when a Vietnamese speaker uses foreign proper names or specialized terms within their speech. ASR systems often struggle to accurately transcribe intra-sentential CS due to their training on monolingual data and the unpredictable nature of CS. This issue is even more pronounced for low-resource languages, where limited data availability hinders the development of robust models. In this study, we propose AdaCS, a normalization model integrates an adaptive bias attention module (BAM) into encoder-decoder network. This novel approach provides a robust solution to CS ASR in unseen domains, thereby significantly enhancing our contribution to the field. By utilizing BAM to both identify and normalize CS phrases, AdaCS enhances its adaptive capabilities with a biased list of words provided during inference. Our method demonstrates impressive performance and the ability to handle unseen CS phrases across various domains. Experiments show that AdaCS outperforms previous state-of-the-art method on Vietnamese CS ASR normalization by considerable WER reduction of 56.2% and 36.8% on the two proposed test sets.

Title: Implementing LoRa MIMO System for Internet of Things
Authors: Atonu Ghosh, Sharath Chandan, Sudip Misra
Abstract: Bandwidth constraints limit LoRa implementations. Contemporary IoT applications require higher throughput than that provided by LoRa. This work introduces a LoRa Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) system and a spatial multiplexing algorithm to address LoRa's bandwidth limitation. The transceivers in the proposed approach modulate the signals on distinct frequencies of the same LoRa band. A Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM) method is used at the transmitters to provide a wider MIMO channel. Unlike conventional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) techniques, this work exploits the orthogonality of the LoRa signals facilitated by its proprietary Chirp Spread Spectrum (CSS) modulation to perform an OFDM in the proposed LoRa MIMO system. By varying the Spreading Factor (SF) and bandwidth of LoRa signals, orthogonal signals can transmit on the same frequency irrespective of the FDM. Even though the channel correlation is minimal for different spreading factors and bandwidths, different Carrier Frequencies (CF) ensure the signals do not overlap and provide additional degrees of freedom. This work assesses the proposed model's performance and conducts an extensive analysis to provide an overview of resources consumed by the proposed system. Finally, this work provides the detailed results of a thorough evaluation of the model on test hardware.

Title: Knowledge Distillation and Enhanced Subdomain Adaptation Using Graph Convolutional Network for Resource-Constrained Bearing Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Mohammadreza Kavianpour, Parisa Kavianpour, Amin Ramezani, Mohammad TH Beheshti
Abstract: Bearing fault diagnosis under varying working conditions faces challenges, including a lack of labeled data, distribution discrepancies, and resource constraints. To address these issues, we propose a progressive knowledge distillation framework that transfers knowledge from a complex teacher model, utilizing a Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) with Autoregressive moving average (ARMA) filters, to a compact and efficient student model. To mitigate distribution discrepancies and labeling uncertainty, we introduce Enhanced Local Maximum Mean Squared Discrepancy (ELMMSD), which leverages mean and variance statistics in the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS) and incorporates a priori probability distributions between labels. This approach increases the distance between clustering centers, bridges subdomain gaps, and enhances subdomain alignment reliability. Experimental results on benchmark datasets (CWRU and JNU) demonstrate that the proposed method achieves superior diagnostic accuracy while significantly reducing computational costs. Comprehensive ablation studies validate the effectiveness of each component, highlighting the robustness and adaptability of the approach across diverse working conditions.

Title: Evaluating Robotic Approach Techniques for the Insertion of a Straight Instrument into a Vitreoretinal Surgery Trocar
Authors: Ross Henry, Martin Huber, Anestis Mablekos-Alexiou, Carlo Seneci, Mohamed Abdelaziz, Hans Natalius, Lyndon da Cruz, Christos Bergeles
Abstract: Advances in vitreoretinal robotic surgery enable precise techniques for gene therapies. This study evaluates three robotic approaches using the 7-DoF robotic arm for docking a micro-precise tool to a trocar: fully co-manipulated, hybrid co-manipulated/teleoperated, and hybrid with camera assistance. The fully co-manipulated approach was the fastest but had a 42% success rate. Hybrid methods showed higher success rates (91.6% and 100%) and completed tasks within 2 minutes. NASA Task Load Index (TLX) assessments indicated lower physical demand and effort for hybrid approaches.

Title: Audio-CoT: Exploring Chain-of-Thought Reasoning in Large Audio Language Model
Authors: Ziyang Ma, Zhuo Chen, Yuping Wang, Eng Siong Chng, Xie Chen
Abstract: Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs) have demonstrated remarkable performance in tasks involving audio perception and understanding, such as speech recognition and audio captioning. However, their reasoning capabilities - critical for solving complex real-world problems - remain underexplored. In this work, we conduct the first exploration into integrating Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning into LALMs to enhance their reasoning ability across auditory modalities. We evaluate representative CoT methods, analyzing their performance in both information extraction and reasoning tasks across sound, music, and speech domains. Our findings reveal that CoT methods significantly improve performance on easy and medium tasks but encounter challenges with hard tasks, where reasoning chains can confuse the model rather than improve accuracy. Additionally, we identify a positive correlation between reasoning path length and accuracy, demonstrating the potential of scaling inference for advanced instruction-following and reasoning. This study not only highlights the promise of CoT in enhancing LALM reasoning capabilities but also identifies key limitations and provides actionable directions for future research.

Title: Movable Antenna Enhanced Integrated Sensing and Communication Via Antenna Position Optimization
Authors: Wenyan Ma, Lipeng Zhu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system aided by the movable-antenna (MA) array, which can improve the communication and sensing performance via flexible antenna movement over conventional fixed-position antenna (FPA) array. First, we consider the downlink multiuser communication, where each user is randomly distributed within a given three-dimensional zone with local movement. To reduce the overhead of frequent antenna movement, the antenna position vector (APV) is designed based on users' statistical channel state information (CSI), so that the antennas only need to be moved in a large timescale. Then, for target sensing, the Cramer-Rao bounds (CRBs) of the estimation mean square error for different spatial angles of arrival (AoAs) are derived as functions of MAs' positions. Based on the above, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the expected minimum achievable rate among all communication users, with given constraints on the maximum acceptable CRB thresholds for target sensing. An alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to iteratively optimize one of the horizontal and vertical APVs of the MA array with the other being fixed. Numerical results demonstrate that our proposed MA arrays can significantly enlarge the trade-off region between communication and sensing performance compared to conventional FPA arrays with different inter-antenna spacing. It is also revealed that the steering vectors of the designed MA arrays exhibit low correlation in the angular domain, thus effectively reducing channel correlation among communication users to enhance their achievable rates, while alleviating ambiguity in target angle estimation to achieve improved sensing accuracy.

Title: Joint Automatic Speech Recognition And Structure Learning For Better Speech Understanding
Authors: Jiliang Hu, Zuchao Li, Mengjia Shen, Haojun Ai, Sheng Li, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Spoken language understanding (SLU) is a structure prediction task in the field of speech. Recently, many works on SLU that treat it as a sequence-to-sequence task have achieved great success. However, This method is not suitable for simultaneous speech recognition and understanding. In this paper, we propose a joint speech recognition and structure learning framework (JSRSL), an end-to-end SLU model based on span, which can accurately transcribe speech and extract structured content simultaneously. We conduct experiments on name entity recognition and intent classification using the Chinese dataset AISHELL-NER and the English dataset SLURP. The results show that our proposed method not only outperforms the traditional sequence-to-sequence method in both transcription and extraction capabilities but also achieves state-of-the-art performance on the two datasets.

Title: Digital Operating Mode Classification of Real-World Amateur Radio Transmissions
Authors: Maximilian Bundscherer, Thomas H. Schmitt, Ilja Baumann, Tobias Bocklet
Abstract: This study presents an ML approach for classifying digital radio operating modes evaluated on real-world transmissions. We generated 98 different parameterized radio signals from 17 digital operating modes, transmitted each of them on the 70 cm (UHF) amateur radio band, and recorded our transmissions with two different architectures of SDR receivers. Three lightweight ML models were trained exclusively on spectrograms of limited non-transmitted signals with random characters as payloads. This training involved an online data augmentation pipeline to simulate various radio channel impairments. Our best model, EfficientNetB0, achieved an accuracy of 93.80% across the 17 operating modes and 85.47% across all 98 parameterized radio signals, evaluated on our real-world transmissions with Wikipedia articles as payloads. Furthermore, we analyzed the impact of varying signal durations & the number of FFT bins on classification, assessed the effectiveness of our simulated channel impairments, and tested our models across multiple simulated SNRs.

Title: A Linear Parameter-Varying Framework for the Analysis of Time-Varying Optimization Algorithms
Authors: Fabian Jakob, Andrea Iannelli
Abstract: In this paper we propose a framework to analyze iterative first-order optimization algorithms for time-varying convex optimization. We assume that the temporal variability is caused by a time-varying parameter entering the objective, which can be measured at the time of decision but whose future values are unknown. We consider the case of strongly convex objective functions with Lipschitz continuous gradients and address the class of running algorithms where only one iteration per time change is performed. We model these algorithms as discrete-time linear parameter varying (LPV) systems in feedback with a time-varying gradient. We leverage the approach of analyzing algorithms as uncertain control interconnections with integral quadratic constraints (IQCs) and generalize that framework to the time-varying case. We propose novel IQCs that are capable of capturing the behavior of time-varying nonlinearities and leverage techniques from the LPV literature to establish novel bounds on the tracking error. Quantitative bounds can be computed by solving a semi-definite program and can be interpreted as an input-to-state stability result with respect to a disturbance signal which increases with the temporal variability of the problem. As a departure from results in this research area, our bounds introduce terms that can be interpreted as a temporal rate of change in the cost function and the optimal value. We exemplify our main results with numerical experiments that showcase how our analysis framework is able to capture convergence rates of different first-order algorithms for time-varying optimization through the choice of IQC and rate bounds.

Title: Estimating Musical Surprisal in Audio
Authors: Mathias Rose Bjare, Giorgia Cantisani, Stefan Lattner, Gerhard Widmer
Abstract: In modeling musical surprisal expectancy with computational methods, it has been proposed to use the information content (IC) of one-step predictions from an autoregressive model as a proxy for surprisal in symbolic music. With an appropriately chosen model, the IC of musical events has been shown to correlate with human perception of surprise and complexity aspects, including tonal and rhythmic complexity. This work investigates whether an analogous methodology can be applied to music audio. We train an autoregressive Transformer model to predict compressed latent audio representations of a pretrained autoencoder network. We verify learning effects by estimating the decrease in IC with repetitions. We investigate the mean IC of musical segment types (e.g., A or B) and find that segment types appearing later in a piece have a higher IC than earlier ones on average. We investigate the IC's relation to audio and musical features and find it correlated with timbral variations and loudness and, to a lesser extent, dissonance, rhythmic complexity, and onset density related to audio and musical features. Finally, we investigate if the IC can predict EEG responses to songs and thus model humans' surprisal in music. We provide code for our method on this http URL.

Title: Encrypted Computation of Collision Probability for Secure Satellite Conjunction Analysis
Authors: Jihoon Suh, Michael Hibbard, Kaoru Teranishi, Takashi Tanaka, Moriba Jah, Maruthi Akella
Abstract: The computation of collision probability ($\mathcal{P}_c$) is crucial for space environmentalism and sustainability by providing decision-making knowledge that can prevent collisions between anthropogenic space objects. However, the accuracy and precision of $\mathcal{P}_c$ computations is often compromised by limitations in computational resources and data availability. While significant improvements have been made in the computational aspects, the rising concerns regarding the privacy of collaborative data sharing can be a major limiting factor in the future conjunction analysis and risk assessment, especially as the space environment grows increasingly privatized, competitive, and fraught with conflicting strategic interests. This paper argues that the importance of privacy measures in space situational awareness (SSA) is underappreciated, and regulatory and compliance measures currently in place are not sufficient by themselves, presenting a significant gap. To address this gap, we introduce a novel encrypted architecture that leverages advanced cryptographic techniques, including homomorphic encryption (HE) and multi-party computation (MPC), to safeguard the privacy of entities computing space sustainability metrics, inter alia, $\mathcal{P}_c$. Our proposed protocol, Encrypted $\mathcal{P}_c$, integrates the Monte Carlo estimation algorithm with cryptographic solutions, enabling secure collision probability computation without exposing sensitive or proprietary information. This research advances secure conjunction analysis by developing a secure MPC protocol for $\mathcal{P}_c$ computation and highlights the need for innovative protocols to ensure a more secure and cooperative SSA landscape.

Title: Investigating Map-Based Path Loss Models: A Study of Feature Representations in Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Ryan G. Dempsey, Jonathan Ethier, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: Path loss prediction is a beneficial tool for efficient use of the radio frequency spectrum. Building on prior research on high-resolution map-based path loss models, this paper studies convolutional neural network input representations in more detail. We investigate different methods of representing scalar features in convolutional neural networks. Specifically, we compare using frequency and distance as input channels to convolutional layers or as scalar inputs to regression layers. We assess model performance using three different feature configurations and find that representing scalar features as image channels results in the strongest generalization.

Title: Decoding Musical Evolution Through Network Science
Authors: Niccolo' Di Marco, Edoardo Loru, Alessandro Galeazzi, Matteo Cinelli, Walter Quattrociocchi
Abstract: Music has always been central to human culture, reflecting and shaping traditions, emotions, and societal changes. Technological advancements have transformed how music is created and consumed, influencing tastes and the music itself. In this study, we use Network Science to analyze musical complexity. Drawing on $\approx20,000$ MIDI files across six macro-genres spanning nearly four centuries, we represent each composition as a weighted directed network to study its structural properties. Our results show that Classical and Jazz compositions have higher complexity and melodic diversity than recently developed genres. However, a temporal analysis reveals a trend toward simplification, with even Classical and Jazz nearing the complexity levels of modern genres. This study highlights how digital tools and streaming platforms shape musical evolution, fostering new genres while driving homogenization and simplicity.

Title: Digital Twin for Smart Societies: A Catalyst for Inclusive and Accessible Healthcare
Authors: Joshit Mohanty, Sujatha Alla, Vaishali, Nagesh Bheesetty, Prasanthi Chidipudi, Satya Prakash Chowdary Nandigam, Marisha Jmukhadze, Puneeth Bheesetty, Narendra Lakshmana Gowda
Abstract: With rapid digitization and digitalization, drawing a fine line between the digital and the physical world has become nearly impossible. It has become essential more than ever to integrate all spheres of life into a single Digital Thread to address pressing challenges of modern society: accessible and inclusive healthcare in terms of equality and equity. Techno-social advancements and mutual acceptance have enabled the infusion of digital models to simulate social settings with minimum resource utilization to make effective decisions. However, a significant gap exists in feeding back the models with appropriate real-time changes. In other words, active behavioral modeling of modern society is lacking, influencing community healthcare as a whole. By creating virtual replicas of (physical) behavioral systems, digital twins can enable real-time monitoring, simulation, and optimization of urban dynamics. This paper explores the potential of digital twins to promote inclusive healthcare for evolving smart cities. We argue that digital twins can be used to: Identify and address disparities in access to healthcare services, Facilitate community participation, Simulate the impact of urban policies and interventions on different groups of people, and Aid policy-making bodies for better access to healthcare. This paper proposes several ways to use digital twins to stitch the actual and virtual societies. Several discussed concepts within this framework envision an active, integrated, and synchronized community aware of data privacy and security. The proposal also provides high-level step-wise transitions that will enable this transformation.

Abstract: Traditionally, traffic incident management (TIM) programs coordinate the deployment of emergency resources to immediate incident requests without accommodating the interdependencies on incident evolutions in the environment. However, ignoring inherent interdependencies on the evolution of incidents in the environment while making current deployment decisions is shortsighted, and the resulting naive deployment strategy can significantly worsen the overall incident delay impact on the network. The interdependencies on incident evolution in the environment, including those between incident occurrences, and those between resource availability in near-future requests and the anticipated duration of the immediate incident request, should be considered through a look-ahead model when making current-stage deployment decisions. This study develops a new proactive framework based on the distributed constraint optimization problem (DCOP) to address the above limitations, overcoming conventional TIM models that cannot accommodate the dependencies in the TIM problem. Furthermore, the optimization objective is formulated to incorporate Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). The UAVs' role in TIM includes exploring uncertain traffic conditions, detecting unexpected events, and augmenting information from roadway traffic sensors. Robustness analysis of our model for multiple TIM scenarios shows satisfactory performance using local search exploration heuristics. Overall, our model reports a significant reduction in total incident delay compared to conventional TIM models. With UAV support, we demonstrate a further decrease in the total incident delay ranging between 5% and 45% for the different number of incidents. UAV's active sensing can shorten response time of emergency vehicles, and a reduction in uncertainties associated with the estimated incident delay impact.

Title: T2LR-Net: An unrolling network learning transformed tensor low-rank prior for dynamic MR image reconstruction
Authors: Yinghao Zhang, Peng Li, Yue Hu
Abstract: The tensor low-rank prior has attracted considerable attention in dynamic MR reconstruction. Tensor low-rank methods preserve the inherent high-dimensional structure of data, allowing for improved extraction and utilization of intrinsic low-rank characteristics. However, most current methods are still confined to utilizing low-rank structures either in the image domain or predefined transformed domains. Designing an optimal transformation adaptable to dynamic MRI reconstruction through manual efforts is inherently challenging. In this paper, we propose a deep unrolling network that utilizes the convolutional neural network (CNN) to adaptively learn the transformed domain for leveraging tensor low-rank priors. Under the supervised mechanism, the learning of the tensor low-rank domain is directly guided by the reconstruction accuracy. Specifically, we generalize the traditional t-SVD to a transformed version based on arbitrary high-dimensional unitary transformations and introduce a novel unitary transformed tensor nuclear norm (UTNN). Subsequently, we present a dynamic MRI reconstruction model based on UTNN and devise an efficient iterative optimization algorithm using ADMM, which is finally unfolded into the proposed T2LR-Net. Experiments on two dynamic cardiac MRI datasets demonstrate that T2LR-Net outperforms the state-of-the-art optimization-based and unrolling network-based methods.

Title: Learning Disentangled Speech Representations
Authors: Yusuf Brima, Ulf Krumnack, Simone Pika, Gunther Heidemann
Abstract: Disentangled representation learning in speech processing has lagged behind other domains, largely due to the lack of datasets with annotated generative factors for robust evaluation. To address this, we propose SynSpeech, a novel large-scale synthetic speech dataset specifically designed to enable research on disentangled speech representations. SynSpeech includes controlled variations in speaker identity, spoken text, and speaking style, with three dataset versions to support experimentation at different levels of complexity. In this study, we present a comprehensive framework to evaluate disentangled representation learning techniques, applying both linear probing and established supervised disentanglement metrics to assess the modularity, compactness, and informativeness of the representations learned by a state-of-the-art model. Using the RAVE model as a test case, we find that SynSpeech facilitates benchmarking across a range of factors, achieving promising disentanglement of simpler features like gender and speaking style, while highlighting challenges in isolating complex attributes like speaker identity. This benchmark dataset and evaluation framework fills a critical gap, supporting the development of more robust and interpretable speech representation learning methods.

Title: Enhance Eye Disease Detection using Learnable Probabilistic Discrete Latents in Machine Learning Architectures
Authors: Anirudh Prabhakaran, YeKun Xiao, Ching-Yu Cheng, Dianbo Liu
Abstract: Ocular diseases, including diabetic retinopathy and glaucoma, present a significant public health challenge due to their high prevalence and potential for causing vision impairment. Early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment and management. In recent years, deep learning models have emerged as powerful tools for analysing medical images, such as retina imaging. However, challenges persist in model relibability and uncertainty estimation, which are critical for clinical decision-making. This study leverages the probabilistic framework of Generative Flow Networks (GFlowNets) to learn the posterior distribution over latent discrete dropout masks for the classification and analysis of ocular diseases using fundus images. We develop a robust and generalizable method that utilizes GFlowOut integrated with ResNet18 and ViT models as the backbone in identifying various ocular conditions. This study employs a unique set of dropout masks - none, random, bottomup, and topdown - to enhance model performance in analyzing these fundus images. Our results demonstrate that our learnable probablistic latents significantly improves accuracy, outperforming the traditional dropout approach. We utilize a gradient map calculation method, Grad-CAM, to assess model explainability, observing that the model accurately focuses on critical image regions for predictions. The integration of GFlowOut in neural networks presents a promising advancement in the automated diagnosis of ocular diseases, with implications for improving clinical workflows and patient outcomes.

Title: CAMSIC: Content-aware Masked Image Modeling Transformer for Stereo Image Compression
Authors: Xinjie Zhang, Shenyuan Gao, Zhening Liu, Jiawei Shao, Xingtong Ge, Dailan He, Tongda Xu, Yan Wang, Jun Zhang
Abstract: Existing learning-based stereo image codec adopt sophisticated transformation with simple entropy models derived from single image codecs to encode latent representations. However, those entropy models struggle to effectively capture the spatial-disparity characteristics inherent in stereo images, which leads to suboptimal rate-distortion results. In this paper, we propose a stereo image compression framework, named CAMSIC. CAMSIC independently transforms each image to latent representation and employs a powerful decoder-free Transformer entropy model to capture both spatial and disparity dependencies, by introducing a novel content-aware masked image modeling (MIM) technique. Our content-aware MIM facilitates efficient bidirectional interaction between prior information and estimated tokens, which naturally obviates the need for an extra Transformer decoder. Experiments show that our stereo image codec achieves state-of-the-art rate-distortion performance on two stereo image datasets Cityscapes and InStereo2K with fast encoding and decoding speed.

Title: Artificial Intelligence for Cochlear Implants: Review of Strategies, Challenges, and Perspectives
Authors: Billel Essaid, Hamza Kheddar, Noureddine Batel, Muhammad E.H.Chowdhury, Abderrahmane Lakas
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) plays a pivotal role in our daily lives, offering utility not only for interacting with machines but also for facilitating communication for individuals with partial or profound hearing impairments. The process involves receiving the speech signal in analog form, followed by various signal processing algorithms to make it compatible with devices of limited capacities, such as cochlear implants (CIs). Unfortunately, these implants, equipped with a finite number of electrodes, often result in speech distortion during synthesis. Despite efforts by researchers to enhance received speech quality using various state-of-the-art (SOTA) signal processing techniques, challenges persist, especially in scenarios involving multiple sources of speech, environmental noise, and other adverse conditions. The advent of new artificial intelligence (AI) methods has ushered in cutting-edge strategies to address the limitations and difficulties associated with traditional signal processing techniques dedicated to CIs. This review aims to comprehensively cover advancements in CI-based ASR and speech enhancement, among other related aspects. The primary objective is to provide a thorough overview of metrics and datasets, exploring the capabilities of AI algorithms in this biomedical field, and summarizing and commenting on the best results obtained. Additionally, the review will delve into potential applications and suggest future directions to bridge existing research gaps in this domain.

Title: Asymmetry of Frequency Distribution in Power Systems: Sources, Estimation, Impact and Control
Authors: Taulant Kerci, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper analyses an emerging real-world phenomena in inverter-based renewable-dominated power systems, namely, asymmetry of frequency distribution. The paper first provides a rationale on why asymmetry reduces the "quality" of the frequency control and system operation. Then it provides qualitative theoretical insights that explain asymmetry in terms of the nonlinearity of real-world power systems and associated models. In particular network losses and pitch angle-based frequency control of wind power plants are discussed. Then the paper proposes a nonlinear compensation control to reduce the asymmetry as well as a statistical metric based on the frequency probability distribution to quantify the level of asymmetry in a power system. Real-world data obtained from the Irish and Australian transmission systems serve to support the theoretical appraisal, whereas simulations based on an IEEE benchmark system show the effectiveness of the proposed nonlinear compensation. The case study also shows that, while automatic generation control reduces asymmetry, frequency control limits and droop-based frequency support provided by wind generation using a tight deadband of 15 mHz, namely active power control, leads to a significant increase in the asymmetry of the frequency probability distribution.

Title: Adaptive Relaxation based Non-Conservative Chance Constrained Stochastic MPC
Authors: Avik Ghosh, Cristian Cortes-Aguirre, Yi-An Chen, Adil Khurram, Jan Kleissl
Abstract: Chance constrained stochastic model predictive controllers (CC-SMPC) trade off full constraint satisfaction for economical plant performance under uncertainty. Previous CC-SMPC works are over-conservative in constraint violations leading to worse economic performance. Other past works require a-priori information about the uncertainty set, limiting their application. This paper considers a discrete LTI system with hard constraints on inputs and chance constraints on states, with unknown uncertainty distribution, statistics, or samples. This work proposes a novel adaptive online update rule to relax the state constraints based on the time-average of past constraint violations, to achieve reduced conservativeness in closed-loop. Under an ideal control policy assumption, it is proven that the time-average of constraint violations asymptotically converges to the maximum allowed violation probability. The method is applied for optimal battery energy storage system (BESS) dispatch in a grid connected microgrid with PV generation and load demand, with chance constraints on BESS state-of-charge (SOC). Realistic simulations show the superior electricity cost saving potential of the proposed method as compared to the traditional economic MPC without chance constraints, and a state-of-the-art approach with chance constraints. We satisfy the chance constraints non-conservatively in closed-loop, effectively trading off increased cost savings with minimal adverse effects on BESS lifetime.

Title: Policy Gradient-Driven Noise Mask
Authors: Mehmet Can Yavuz, Yang Yang
Abstract: Deep learning classifiers face significant challenges when dealing with heterogeneous multi-modal and multi-organ biomedical datasets. The low-level feature distinguishability limited to imaging-modality hinders the classifiers' ability to learn high-level semantic relationships, resulting in sub-optimal performance. To address this issue, image augmentation strategies are employed as regularization techniques. While additive noise input during network training is a well-established augmentation as regularization method, modern pipelines often favor more robust techniques such as dropout and weight decay. This preference stems from the observation that combining these established techniques with noise input can adversely affect model performance. In this study, we propose a novel pretraining pipeline that learns to generate conditional noise mask specifically tailored to improve performance on multi-modal and multi-organ datasets. As a reinforcement learning algorithm, our approach employs a dual-component system comprising a very light-weight policy network that learns to sample conditional noise using a differentiable beta distribution as well as a classifier network. The policy network is trained using the reinforce algorithm to generate image-specific noise masks that regularize the classifier during pretraining. A key aspect is that the policy network's role is limited to obtaining an intermediate (or heated) model before fine-tuning. During inference, the policy network is omitted, allowing direct comparison between the baseline and noise-regularized models. We conducted experiments and related analyses on RadImageNet datasets. Results demonstrate that fine-tuning the intermediate models consistently outperforms conventional training algorithms on both classification and generalization to unseen concept tasks.

Title: UCIL: An Unsupervised Class Incremental Learning Approach for Sound Event Detection
Authors: Yang Xiao, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: This work explores class-incremental learning (CIL) for sound event detection (SED), advancing adaptability towards real-world scenarios. CIL's success in domains like computer vision inspired our SED-tailored method, addressing the unique challenges of diverse and complex audio environments. Our approach employs an independent unsupervised learning framework with a distillation loss function to integrate new sound classes while preserving the SED model consistency across incremental tasks. We further enhance this framework with a sample selection strategy for unlabeled data and a balanced exemplar update mechanism, ensuring varied and illustrative sound representations. Evaluating various continual learning methods on the DCASE 2023 Task 4 dataset, we find that our research offers insights into each method's applicability for real-world SED systems that can have newly added sound classes. The findings also delineate future directions of CIL in dynamic audio settings.

Title: Data-Driven Prediction and Uncertainty Quantification of PWR Crud-Induced Power Shift Using Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Aidan Furlong, Farah Alsafadi, Scott Palmtag, Andrew Godfrey, Xu Wu
Abstract: The development of Crud-Induced Power Shift (CIPS) is an operational challenge in Pressurized Water Reactors that is due to the development of crud on the fuel rod cladding. The available predictive tools developed previously, usually based on fundamental physics, are computationally expensive and have shown differing degrees of accuracy. This work proposes a completely top-down approach to predict CIPS instances on an assembly level with reactor-specific calibration built-in. Built using artificial neural networks, this work uses a three-dimensional convolutional approach to leverage the image-like layout of the input data. As a classifier, the convolutional neural network model predicts whether a given assembly will experience CIPS as well as the time of occurrence during a given cycle. This surrogate model is both trained and tested using a combination of calculated core model parameters and measured plant data from Unit 1 of the Catawba Nuclear Station. After the evaluation of its performance using various metrics, Monte Carlo dropout is employed for extensive uncertainty quantification of the model predictions. The results indicate that this methodology could be a viable approach in predicting CIPS with an assembly-level resolution across both clean and afflicted cycles, while using limited computational resources.

Title: Cost-optimized probabilistic maintenance for condition monitoring of wind turbines with rare failures
Authors: Viktor Begun, Ulrich Schlickewei
Abstract: We propose a method, a model, and a form of presenting model results for condition monitoring of a small set of wind turbines with rare failures. The main new ingredient of the method is to sample failure thresholds according to the profit they give to an operating company. The model is a multiple linear regression with seasonal components and external regressors, representing all sensor components except for the selected one. To overcome the scarcity of the training data, we use the median sensor values from all available turbines in their healthy state. The cumulated deviation from the normal behavior model obtained for this median turbine is calibrated for each turbine at the beginning of the test period and after known failures. The proposed form of presenting results is to set a scale for possible costs, control for random maintenance, and show a whole distribution of costs depending on the free model parameters. We make a case study on an open dataset with SCADA data from multiple sensors and show that considering the influence of turbine components is more critical than seasonality. The distribution, the average, and the standard deviation of maintenance costs can be very different for similar minimal costs. Random maintenance can be more profitable than reactive maintenance and other approaches. Our predictive maintenance model outperforms random maintenance and competitors for the whole set of considered turbines, giving substantial savings.

Title: OCTolyzer: Fully automatic toolkit for segmentation and feature extracting in optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy data
Authors: Jamie Burke, Justin Engelmann, Samuel Gibbon, Charlene Hamid, Diana Moukaddem, Dan Pugh, Tariq Farrah, Niall Strang, Neeraj Dhaun, Tom MacGillivray, Stuart King, Ian J.C. MacCormick
Abstract: Optical coherence tomography (OCT) and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (SLO) of the eye has become essential to ophthalmology and the emerging field of oculomics, thus requiring a need for transparent, reproducible, and rapid analysis of this data for clinical research and the wider research community. Here, we introduce OCTolyzer, the first open-source toolkit for retinochoroidal analysis in OCT/SLO data. It features two analysis suites for OCT and SLO data, facilitating deep learning-based anatomical segmentation and feature extraction of the cross-sectional retinal and choroidal layers and en face retinal vessels. We describe OCTolyzer and evaluate the reproducibility of its OCT choroid analysis. At the population level, metrics for choroid region thickness were highly reproducible, with a mean absolute error (MAE)/Pearson correlation for macular volume choroid thickness (CT) of 6.7$\mu$m/0.99, macular B-scan CT of 11.6$\mu$m/0.99, and peripapillary CT of 5.0$\mu$m/0.99. Macular choroid vascular index (CVI) also showed strong reproducibility, with MAE/Pearson for volume CVI yielding 0.0271/0.97 and B-scan CVI 0.0130/0.91. At the eye level, measurement noise for regional and vessel metrics was below 5% and 20% of the population's variability, respectively. Outliers were caused by poor-quality B-scans with thick choroids and invisible choroid-sclera boundary. Processing times on a laptop CPU were under three seconds for macular/peripapillary B-scans and 85 seconds for volume scans. OCTolyzer can convert OCT/SLO data into reproducible and clinically meaningful retinochoroidal features and will improve the standardisation of ocular measurements in OCT/SLO image analysis, requiring no specialised training or proprietary software to be used.

Title: Data Requirements and Prediction Scaling for Long-Term Failure Forecasts in Wind Turbines
Authors: Viktor Begun, Ulrich Schlickewei
Abstract: We investigate the key factors that enable early failure forecasting in wind turbines. For this purpose, we analyze studies with long-term forecasts and compare their main features: prediction time, methods, targeted components, dataset size, and check the effect of using additional sensors. We found that the size of the dataset is the main factor and that an approximate linear scaling holds: the number of forecast days is twice the size of the dataset, measured in turbine years. We also observe that the data allow us to quantify the meaning of "big" and "long" in the terms "big data" and "long-term" forecasts, which are found to be ten turbine years and two weeks.

Title: Dark Experience for Incremental Keyword Spotting
Authors: Tianyi Peng, Yang Xiao
Abstract: Spoken keyword spotting (KWS) is crucial for identifying keywords within audio inputs and is widely used in applications like Apple Siri and Google Home, particularly on edge devices. Current deep learning-based KWS systems, which are typically trained on a limited set of keywords, can suffer from performance degradation when encountering new domains, a challenge often addressed through few-shot fine-tuning. However, this adaptation frequently leads to catastrophic forgetting, where the model's performance on original data deteriorates. Progressive continual learning (CL) strategies have been proposed to overcome this, but they face limitations such as the need for task-ID information and increased storage, making them less practical for lightweight devices. To address these challenges, we introduce Dark Experience for Keyword Spotting (DE-KWS), a novel CL approach that leverages dark knowledge to distill past experiences throughout the training process. DE-KWS combines rehearsal and distillation, using both ground truth labels and logits stored in a memory buffer to maintain model performance across tasks. Evaluations on the Google Speech Command dataset show that DE-KWS outperforms existing CL baselines in average accuracy without increasing model size, offering an effective solution for resource-constrained edge devices. The scripts are available on GitHub for the future research.

Title: Effective Integration of KAN for Keyword Spotting
Authors: Anfeng Xu, Biqiao Zhang, Shuyu Kong, Yiteng Huang, Zhaojun Yang, Sangeeta Srivastava, Ming Sun
Abstract: Keyword spotting (KWS) is an important speech processing component for smart devices with voice assistance capability. In this paper, we investigate if Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) can be used to enhance the performance of KWS. We explore various approaches to integrate KAN for a model architecture based on 1D Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). We find that KAN is effective at modeling high-level features in lower-dimensional spaces, resulting in improved KWS performance when integrated appropriately. The findings shed light on understanding KAN for speech processing tasks and on other modalities for future researchers.

Title: Improving Robustness of Diffusion-Based Zero-Shot Speech Synthesis via Stable Formant Generation
Authors: Changjin Han, Seokgi Lee, Gyuhyeon Nam, Gyeongsu Chae
Abstract: Diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in text-to-speech (TTS), even in zero-shot scenarios. Recent efforts aim to address the trade-off between inference speed and sound quality, often considered the primary drawback of diffusion models. However, we find a critical mispronunciation issue is being overlooked. Our preliminary study reveals the unstable pronunciation resulting from the diffusion process. Based on this observation, we introduce StableForm-TTS, a novel zero-shot speech synthesis framework designed to produce robust pronunciation while maintaining the advantages of diffusion modeling. By pioneering the adoption of source-filter theory in diffusion TTS, we propose an elaborate architecture for stable formant generation. Experimental results on unseen speakers show that our model outperforms the state-of-the-art method in terms of pronunciation accuracy and naturalness, with comparable speaker similarity. Moreover, our model demonstrates effective scalability as both data and model sizes increase. Audio samples are available online: this https URL.

Title: DNN-based Enhanced DOA Sensing via Massive MIMO Receiver with Switches-based Hybrid Architecture
Authors: Yifan Li, Kang Wei, Linqiong Jia, Jun Zou, Feng Shu, Yaoliang Song, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: Switches-based hybrid architecture has attracted much attention, especially in directional-of-arrival (DOA) sensing, due to its ability of significantly reducing the hardware cost by compressing massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) arrays with switching networks. However, this structure will lead to a degradation in the degrees of freedom (DOF) and accuracy of DOA estimation. To address these two issues, we first propose a switches-based sparse hybrid array (SW-SHA). In this method, we design a dynamic switching network to form a synthesized sparse array, i.e., SW-SHA, that can enlarge the virtual aperture obtained by the difference co-array, thereby significantly enhancing the DOF. Second, in order to improve the DOA estimation accuracy of switches-based hybrid arrays, a deep neural network (DNN)-based method called ASN-DNN is proposed. It includes an antenna selection network (ASN) for optimizing the switch connections based on the criterion of minimizing the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) under the peak sidelobe level (PSL) constraint and a DNN for DOA estimation. Then by integrating ASN and DNN into an iterative process, the ASN-DNN is obtained. Furthermore, the closed-form expression of CRLB for DOA estimation is derived to evaluate the performance lower bound of switches-based hybrid arrays and provide a benchmark for ASN-DNN. The simulation results show the proposed ASN-DNN can achieve a greater performance than traditional methods, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions.

Title: Unsupervised Word Discovery: Boundary Detection with Clustering vs. Dynamic Programming
Authors: Simon Malan, Benjamin van Niekerk, Herman Kamper
Abstract: We look at the long-standing problem of segmenting unlabeled speech into word-like segments and clustering these into a lexicon. Several previous methods use a scoring model coupled with dynamic programming to find an optimal segmentation. Here we propose a much simpler strategy: we predict word boundaries using the dissimilarity between adjacent self-supervised features, then we cluster the predicted segments to construct a lexicon. For a fair comparison, we update the older ES-KMeans dynamic programming method with better features and boundary constraints. On the five-language ZeroSpeech benchmarks, our simple approach gives similar state-of-the-art results compared to the new ES-KMeans+ method, while being almost five times faster.

Title: Quantum Reinforcement Learning-Based Two-Stage Unit Commitment Framework for Enhanced Power Systems Robustness
Authors: Xiang Wei, Ziqing Zhu
Abstract: The volatility of renewable energy sources and fluctuations in real-time electricity demand present significant challenges to traditional unit commitment (UC) methods, often causing system constraint violations. Conventional optimization algorithms face substantial difficulties in responding quickly to these variations, frequently requiring the relaxation of constraints or producing infeasible solutions. To address these challenges, a robust two-stage UC framework based on quantum reinforcement learning (QRL) is proposed in this work, which improves both decision-making speed and solution feasibility. In the first stage, the day-ahead scheduling of thermal generators is optimized. In the second stage, real-time adjustments are made to account for changes in renewable generation and load, with microgrids integrated to reduce the impact of uncertainties on the power system. Both stages are formulated as Markov decision processes (MDPs), and QRL is used to efficiently solve the problem. QRL provides key advantages, including more effective navigation of the high-dimensional solution space and faster convergence compared to classical methods, thus enhancing the robustness and computational efficiency of UC operations. The proposed QRL-based two-stage UC framework is validated using the IEEE RTS 24-bus system. Results demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach, showing improved solution feasibility and computational speed compared to conventional UC methods.

Title: Leveraging LLM and Text-Queried Separation for Noise-Robust Sound Event Detection
Authors: Han Yin, Yang Xiao, Jisheng Bai, Rohan Kumar Das
Abstract: Sound Event Detection (SED) is challenging in noisy environments where overlapping sounds obscure target events. Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to isolate the target sound events from a noisy clip. However, this approach can fail when the exact target sound is unknown, particularly in noisy test sets, leading to reduced performance. To address this issue, we leverage the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) to analyze and summarize acoustic data. By using LLMs to identify and select specific noise types, we implement a noise augmentation method for noise-robust fine-tuning. The fine-tuned model is applied to predict clip-wise event predictions as text queries for the LASS model. Our studies demonstrate that the proposed method improves SED performance in noisy environments. This work represents an early application of LLMs in noise-robust SED and suggests a promising direction for handling overlapping events in SED.

Title: Blind Estimation of Sub-band Acoustic Parameters from Ambisonics Recordings using Spectro-Spatial Covariance Features
Authors: Hanyu Meng, Jeroen Breebaart, Jeremy Stoddard, Vidhyasaharan Sethu, Eliathamby Ambikairajah
Abstract: Estimating frequency-varying acoustic parameters is essential for enhancing immersive perception in realistic spatial audio creation. In this paper, we propose a unified framework that blindly estimates reverberation time (T60), direct-to-reverberant ratio (DRR), and clarity (C50) across 10 frequency bands using first-order Ambisonics (FOA) speech recordings as inputs. The proposed framework utilizes a novel feature named Spectro-Spatial Covariance Vector (SSCV), efficiently representing temporal, spectral as well as spatial information of the FOA signal. Our models significantly outperform existing single-channel methods with only spectral information, reducing estimation errors by more than half for all three acoustic parameters. Additionally, we introduce FOA-Conv3D, a novel back-end network for effectively utilising the SSCV feature with a 3D convolutional encoder. FOA-Conv3D outperforms the convolutional neural network (CNN) and recurrent convolutional neural network (CRNN) backends, achieving lower estimation errors and accounting for a higher proportion of variance (PoV) for all 3 acoustic parameters.

Title: Multipath Mitigation Technology-integrated GNSS Direct Position Estimation Plug-in Module
Authors: Sergio Vicenzo, Bing Xu
Abstract: Direct position estimation (DPE) is an effective solution to the MP issue at the signal processing level. Unlike two-step positioning (2SP) receivers, DPE directly solves for the receiver position, velocity, and time (PVT) in the navigation domain, without the estimation of intermediate measurements, thus allowing it to provide more robust and accurate PVT estimates in the presence of multipath (MP) and weak signals. But GNSS positioning with DPE is mostly left unapplied commercially, and continuing research into DPE has remained relatively stagnant over the past few years. To encourage further research on DPE by the GNSS community, we propose a DPE plug-in module that can be integrated into the conventional 2SP software-defined receivers (SDRs). Programmed in MATLAB, the proposed DPE plug-in module is aimed for better understanding and familiarity of a practical implementation of DPE. Its plug-in module architecture allows it to be incorporated with 2SP MATLAB SDRs, both vector tracking and scalar tracking with minimum changes, making it easy to use, and provides greater flexibility for researchers using various 2SP SDRs. We propose to further improve the performance of DPE against MP by incorporating Multipath Mitigation Technology (MMT) into DPE. Referred to as MMT-DPE, it is proposed as a variant of DPE that adds the MP components into DPE signal model by integrating MMT cost function into DPE, with the aim to better suit DPE for urban environment applications. Results show that while in MP-only conditions, an MMT-integrated 2SP (MMT-2SP) has similar performance with MMT-DPE, the proposed MMT-DPE manages to show great superiority against NLOS, making it the preferable option for applications in urban environments.

Authors: Ryan G. Dempsey, Jonathan Ethier, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: Radio deployments and spectrum planning benefit from path loss predictions. Obstructions along a communications link are often considered implicitly or through derived metrics such as representative clutter height or total obstruction depth. In this paper, we propose a path-specific path loss prediction method that uses convolutional neural networks to automatically perform feature extraction from high-resolution obstruction height maps. Our methods result in low prediction error in a variety of environments without requiring derived metrics.

Title: A Cascaded Dilated Convolution Approach for Mpox Lesion Classification
Authors: Ayush Deshmukh
Abstract: The global outbreak of the Mpox virus, classified as a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC) by the World Health Organization, presents significant diagnostic challenges due to its visual similarity to other skin lesion diseases. Traditional diagnostic methods for Mpox, which rely on clinical symptoms and laboratory tests, are slow and labor intensive. Deep learning-based approaches for skin lesion classification offer a promising alternative. However, developing a model that balances efficiency with accuracy is crucial to ensure reliable and timely diagnosis without compromising performance. This study introduces the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention (CAGA) framework to address these challenges, combining the Cascaded Atrous Attention module and the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism. The Cascaded Atrous Attention module utilizes dilated convolutions and cascades the outputs to enhance multi-scale representation. This is integrated into the Cascaded Group Attention mechanism, which reduces redundancy in Multi-Head Self-Attention. By integrating the Cascaded Atrous Group Attention module with EfficientViT-L1 as the backbone architecture, this approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, reaching an accuracy of 98% on the Mpox Close Skin Image (MCSI) dataset while reducing model parameters by 37.5% compared to the original EfficientViT-L1. The model's robustness is demonstrated through extensive validation on two additional benchmark datasets, where it consistently outperforms existing approaches.

Title: Attacking Voice Anonymization Systems with Augmented Feature and Speaker Identity Difference
Authors: Yanzhe Zhang, Zhonghao Bi, Feiyang Xiao, Xuefeng Yang, Qiaoxi Zhu, Jian Guan
Abstract: This study focuses on the First VoicePrivacy Attacker Challenge within the ICASSP 2025 Signal Processing Grand Challenge, which aims to develop speaker verification systems capable of determining whether two anonymized speech signals are from the same speaker. However, differences between feature distributions of original and anonymized speech complicate this task. To address this challenge, we propose an attacker system that combines Data Augmentation enhanced feature representation and Speaker Identity Difference enhanced classifier to improve verification performance, termed DA-SID. Specifically, data augmentation strategies (i.e., data fusion and SpecAugment) are utilized to mitigate feature distribution gaps, while probabilistic linear discriminant analysis (PLDA) is employed to further enhance speaker identity difference. Our system significantly outperforms the baseline, demonstrating exceptional effectiveness and robustness against various voice anonymization systems, ultimately securing a top-5 ranking in the challenge.

Title: GLFC: Unified Global-Local Feature and Contrast Learning with Mamba-Enhanced UNet for Synthetic CT Generation from CBCT
Authors: Xianhao Zhou, Jianghao Wu, Huangxuan Zhao, Lei Chen, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang
Abstract: Generating synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is desirable for improving the image quality of CBCT. Existing synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often face difficulties in effectively capturing both global and local features and contrasts for high-quality sCT generation. In this work, we propose a Global-Local Feature and Contrast learning (GLFC) framework for sCT generation. First, a Mamba-Enhanced UNet (MEUNet) is introduced by integrating Mamba blocks into the skip connections of a high-resolution UNet for effective global and local feature learning. Second, we propose a Multiple Contrast Loss (MCL) that calculates synthetic loss at different intensity windows to improve quality for both soft tissues and bone regions. Experiments on the SynthRAD2023 dataset demonstrate that GLFC improved the SSIM of sCT from 77.91% to 91.50% compared with the original CBCT, and significantly outperformed several existing methods for sCT generation.

Title: SCC-YOLO: An Improved Object Detector for Assisting in Brain Tumor Diagnosis
Authors: Runci Bai
Abstract: Brain tumors can result in neurological dysfunction, alterations in cognitive and psychological states, increased intracranial pressure, and the occurrence of seizures, thereby presenting a substantial risk to human life and health. The You Only Look Once(YOLO) series models have demonstrated superior accuracy in object detection for medical imaging. In this paper, we develop a novel SCC-YOLO architecture by integrating the SCConv attention mechanism into YOLOv9. The SCConv module reconstructs an efficient convolutional module by reducing spatial and channel redundancy among features, thereby enhancing the learning of image features. We investigate the impact of intergrating different attention mechanisms with the YOLOv9 model on brain tumor image detection using both the Br35H dataset and our self-made dataset(Brain_Tumor_Dataset). Experimental results show that on the Br35H dataset, SCC-YOLO achieved a 0.3% improvement in mAp50 compared to YOLOv9, while on our self-made dataset, SCC-YOLO exhibited a 0.5% improvement over YOLOv9. SCC-YOLO has reached state-of-the-art performance in brain tumor detection. Source code is available at : this https URL

Title: SELMA3D challenge: Self-supervised learning for 3D light-sheet microscopy image segmentation
Authors: Ying Chen, Rami Al-Maskari, Izabela Horvath, Mayar Ali, Luciano Hoher, Kaiyuan Yang, Zengming Lin, Zhiwei Zhai, Mengzhe Shen, Dejin Xun, Yi Wang, Tony Xu, Maged Goubran, Yunheng Wu, Kensaku Mori, Johannes C. Paetzold, Ali Erturk
Abstract: Recent innovations in light sheet microscopy, paired with developments in tissue clearing techniques, enable the 3D imaging of large mammalian tissues with cellular resolution. Combined with the progress in large-scale data analysis, driven by deep learning, these innovations empower researchers to rapidly investigate the morphological and functional properties of diverse biological samples. Segmentation, a crucial preliminary step in the analysis process, can be automated using domain-specific deep learning models with expert-level performance. However, these models exhibit high sensitivity to domain shifts, leading to a significant drop in accuracy when applied to data outside their training distribution. To address this limitation, and inspired by the recent success of self-supervised learning in training generalizable models, we organized the SELMA3D Challenge during the MICCAI 2024 conference. SELMA3D provides a vast collection of light-sheet images from cleared mice and human brains, comprising 35 large 3D images-each with over 1000^3 voxels-and 315 annotated small patches for finetuning, preliminary testing and final testing. The dataset encompasses diverse biological structures, including vessel-like and spot-like structures. Five teams participated in all phases of the challenge, and their proposed methods are reviewed in this paper. Quantitative and qualitative results from most participating teams demonstrate that self-supervised learning on large datasets improves segmentation model performance and generalization. We will continue to support and extend SELMA3D as an inaugural MICCAI challenge focused on self-supervised learning for 3D microscopy image segmentation.

Title: HyFusion: Enhanced Reception Field Transformer for Hyperspectral Image Fusion
Authors: Chia-Ming Lee, Yu-Fan Lin, Yu-Hao Ho, Li-Wei Kang, Chih-Chung Hsu
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) fusion addresses the challenge of reconstructing High-Resolution HSIs (HR-HSIs) from High-Resolution Multispectral images (HR-MSIs) and Low-Resolution HSIs (LR-HSIs), a critical task given the high costs and hardware limitations associated with acquiring high-quality HSIs. While existing methods leverage spatial and spectral relationships, they often suffer from limited receptive fields and insufficient feature utilization, leading to suboptimal performance. Furthermore, the scarcity of high-quality HSI data highlights the importance of efficient data utilization to maximize reconstruction quality. To address these issues, we propose HyFusion, a novel Dual-Coupled Network (DCN) framework designed to enhance cross-domain feature extraction and enable effective feature map reusing. The framework first processes HR-MSI and LR-HSI inputs through specialized subnetworks that mutually enhance each other during feature extraction, preserving complementary spatial and spectral details. At its core, HyFusion utilizes an Enhanced Reception Field Block (ERFB), which combines shifting-window attention and dense connections to expand the receptive field, effectively capturing long-range dependencies while minimizing information loss. Extensive experiments demonstrate that HyFusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in HR-MSI/LR-HSI fusion, significantly improving reconstruction quality while maintaining a compact model size and computational efficiency. By integrating enhanced receptive fields and feature map reusing into a coupled network architecture, HyFusion provides a practical and effective solution for HSI fusion in resource-constrained scenarios, setting a new benchmark in hyperspectral imaging. Our code will be publicly available.

Title: RMTransformer: Accurate Radio Map Construction and Coverage Prediction
Authors: Yuxuan Li, Cheng Zhang, Wen Wang, Yongming Huang
Abstract: Radio map, or pathloss map prediction, is a crucial method for wireless network modeling and management. By leveraging deep learning to construct pathloss patterns from geographical maps, an accurate digital replica of the transmission environment could be established with less computational overhead and lower prediction error compared to traditional model-driven techniques. While existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods predominantly rely on convolutional architectures, this paper introduces a hybrid transformer-convolution model, termed RMTransformer, to enhance the accuracy of radio map prediction. The proposed model features a multi-scale transformer-based encoder for efficient feature extraction and a convolution-based decoder for precise pixel-level image reconstruction. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme significantly improves prediction accuracy, and over a 30% reduction in root mean square error (RMSE) is achieved compared to typical SOTA approaches.

Title: Mel-Spectrogram Inversion via Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Yoshiki Masuyama, Natsuki Ueno, Nobutaka Ono
Abstract: Signal reconstruction from its mel-spectrogram is known as mel-spectrogram inversion and has many applications, including speech and foley sound synthesis. In this paper, we propose a mel-spectrogram inversion method based on a rigorous optimization algorithm. To reconstruct a time-domain signal with inverse short-time Fourier transform (STFT), both full-band STFT magnitude and phase should be predicted from a given mel-spectrogram. Their joint estimation has outperformed the cascaded full-band magnitude prediction and phase reconstruction by preventing error accumulation. However, the existing joint estimation method requires many iterations, and there remains room for performance improvement. We present an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based joint estimation method motivated by its success in various nonconvex optimization problems including phase reconstruction. An efficient update of each variable is derived by exploiting the conditional independence among the variables. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method on speech and foley sounds.

Title: AI-Driven Diabetic Retinopathy Screening: Multicentric Validation of AIDRSS in India
Authors: Amit Kr Dey, Pradeep Walia, Girish Somvanshi, Abrar Ali, Sagarnil Das, Pallabi Paul, Minakhi Ghosh
Abstract: Purpose: Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of vision loss, particularly in India, where access to retina specialists is limited in rural areas. This study aims to evaluate the Artificial Intelligence-based Diabetic Retinopathy Screening System (AIDRSS) for DR detection and prevalence assessment, addressing the growing need for scalable, automated screening solutions in resource-limited settings. Approach: A multicentric, cross-sectional study was conducted in Kolkata, India, involving 5,029 participants and 10,058 macula-centric retinal fundus images. The AIDRSS employed a deep learning algorithm with 50 million trainable parameters, integrated with Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) preprocessing for enhanced image quality. DR was graded using the International Clinical Diabetic Retinopathy (ICDR) Scale, categorizing disease into five stages (DR0 to DR4). Statistical metrics including sensitivity, specificity, and prevalence rates were evaluated against expert retina specialist assessments. Results: The prevalence of DR in the general population was 13.7%, rising to 38.2% among individuals with elevated random blood glucose levels. The AIDRSS achieved an overall sensitivity of 92%, specificity of 88%, and 100% sensitivity for detecting referable DR (DR3 and DR4). These results demonstrate the system's robust performance in accurately identifying and grading DR in a diverse population. Conclusions: AIDRSS provides a reliable, scalable solution for early DR detection in resource-constrained environments. Its integration of advanced AI techniques ensures high diagnostic accuracy, with potential to significantly reduce the burden of diabetes-related vision loss in underserved regions.

Title: Zeroth-Order Actor-Critic: An Evolutionary Framework for Sequential Decision Problems
Authors: Yuheng Lei, Yao Lyu, Guojian Zhan, Tao Zhang, Jiangtao Li, Jianyu Chen, Shengbo Eben Li, Sifa Zheng
Abstract: Evolutionary algorithms (EAs) have shown promise in solving sequential decision problems (SDPs) by simplifying them to static optimization problems and searching for the optimal policy parameters in a zeroth-order way. While these methods are highly versatile, they often suffer from high sample complexity due to their ignorance of the underlying temporal structures. In contrast, reinforcement learning (RL) methods typically formulate SDPs as Markov Decision Process (MDP). Although more sample efficient than EAs, RL methods are restricted to differentiable policies and prone to getting stuck in local optima. To address these issues, we propose a novel evolutionary framework Zeroth-Order Actor-Critic (ZOAC). We propose to use step-wise exploration in parameter space and theoretically derive the zeroth-order policy gradient. We further utilize the actor-critic architecture to effectively leverage the Markov property of SDPs and reduce the variance of gradient estimators. In each iteration, ZOAC employs samplers to collect trajectories with parameter space exploration, and alternates between first-order policy evaluation (PEV) and zeroth-order policy improvement (PIM). To evaluate the effectiveness of ZOAC, we apply it to a challenging multi-lane driving task, optimizing the parameters in a rule-based, non-differentiable driving policy that consists of three sub-modules: behavior selection, path planning, and trajectory tracking. We also compare it with gradient-based RL methods on three Gymnasium tasks, optimizing neural network policies with thousands of parameters. Experimental results demonstrate the strong capability of ZOAC in solving SDPs. ZOAC significantly outperforms EAs that treat the problem as static optimization and matches the performance of gradient-based RL methods even without first-order information, in terms of total average return across all tasks.

Title: A Novel Training Framework for Physics-informed Neural Networks: Towards Real-time Applications in Ultrafast Ultrasound Blood Flow Imaging
Authors: Haotian Guan, Jinping Dong, Wei-Ning Lee
Abstract: Ultrafast ultrasound blood flow imaging is a state-of-the-art technique for depiction of complex blood flow dynamics in vivo through thousands of full-view image data (or, timestamps) acquired per second. Physics-informed Neural Network (PINN) is one of the most preeminent solvers of the Navier-Stokes equations, widely used as the governing equation of blood flow. However, that current approaches rely on full Navier-Stokes equations is impractical for ultrafast ultrasound. We hereby propose a novel PINN training framework for solving the Navier-Stokes equations. It involves discretizing Navier-Stokes equations into steady state and sequentially solving them with test-time adaptation. The novel training framework is coined as SeqPINN. Upon its success, we propose a parallel training scheme for all timestamps based on averaged constant stochastic gradient descent as initialization. Uncertainty estimation through Stochastic Weight Averaging Gaussian is then used as an indicator of generalizability of the initialization. This algorithm, named SP-PINN, further expedites training of PINN while achieving comparable accuracy with SeqPINN. The performance of SeqPINN and SP-PINN was evaluated through finite-element simulations and in vitro phantoms of single-branch and trifurcate blood vessels. Results show that both algorithms were manyfold faster than the original design of PINN, while respectively achieving Root Mean Square Errors of 0.63 cm/s and 0.81 cm/s on the straight vessel and 1.35 cm/s and 1.63 cm/s on the trifurcate vessel when recovering blood flow velocities. The successful implementation of SeqPINN and SP-PINN open the gate for real-time training of PINN for Navier-Stokes equations and subsequently reliable imaging-based blood flow assessment in clinical practice.

Title: On the Effectiveness of ASR Representations in Real-world Noisy Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Xiaohan Shi, Jiajun He, Xingfeng Li, Tomoki Toda
Abstract: This paper proposes an efficient attempt to noisy speech emotion recognition (NSER). Conventional NSER approaches have proven effective in mitigating the impact of artificial noise sources, such as white Gaussian noise, but are limited to non-stationary noises in real-world environments due to their complexity and uncertainty. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a new method for NSER by adopting the automatic speech recognition (ASR) model as a noise-robust feature extractor to eliminate non-vocal information in noisy speech. We first obtain intermediate layer information from the ASR model as a feature representation for emotional speech and then apply this representation for the downstream NSER task. Our experimental results show that 1) the proposed method achieves better NSER performance compared with the conventional noise reduction method, 2) outperforms self-supervised learning approaches, and 3) even outperforms text-based approaches using ASR transcription or the ground truth transcription of noisy speech.

Title: Physics-Informed Neural Network Lyapunov Functions: PDE Characterization, Learning, and Verification
Authors: Jun Liu, Yiming Meng, Maxwell Fitzsimmons, Ruikun Zhou
Abstract: We provide a systematic investigation of using physics-informed neural networks to compute Lyapunov functions. We encode Lyapunov conditions as a partial differential equation (PDE) and use this for training neural network Lyapunov functions. We analyze the analytical properties of the solutions to the Lyapunov and Zubov PDEs. In particular, we show that employing the Zubov equation in training neural Lyapunov functions can lead to approximate regions of attraction close to the true domain of attraction. We also examine approximation errors and the convergence of neural approximations to the unique solution of Zubov's equation. We then provide sufficient conditions for the learned neural Lyapunov functions that can be readily verified by satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solvers, enabling formal verification of both local stability analysis and region-of-attraction estimates in the large. Through a number of nonlinear examples, ranging from low to high dimensions, we demonstrate that the proposed framework can outperform traditional sums-of-squares (SOS) Lyapunov functions obtained using semidefinite programming (SDP).

Title: Improving the Performance of Echo State Networks Through State Feedback
Authors: Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Reservoir computing, using nonlinear dynamical systems, offers a cost-effective alternative to neural networks for complex tasks involving processing of sequential data, time series modeling, and system identification. Echo state networks (ESNs), a type of reservoir computer, mirror neural networks but simplify training. They apply fixed, random linear transformations to the internal state, followed by nonlinear changes. This process, guided by input signals and linear regression, adapts the system to match target characteristics, reducing computational demands. A potential drawback of ESNs is that the fixed reservoir may not offer the complexity needed for specific problems. While directly altering (training) the internal ESN would reintroduce the computational burden, an indirect modification can be achieved by redirecting some output as input. This feedback can influence the internal reservoir state, yielding ESNs with enhanced complexity suitable for broader challenges. In this paper, we demonstrate that by feeding some component of the reservoir state back into the network through the input, we can drastically improve upon the performance of a given ESN. We rigorously prove that, for any given ESN, feedback will almost always improve the accuracy of the output. For a set of three tasks, each representing different problem classes, we find that with feedback the average error measures are reduced by $30\%-60\%$. Remarkably, feedback provides at least an equivalent performance boost to doubling the initial number of computational nodes, a computationally expensive and technologically challenging alternative. These results demonstrate the broad applicability and substantial usefulness of this feedback scheme.

Title: Frame Codes for the Block-Erasure Channel -- Extended Version
Authors: Itamar Jacoby, Ram Zamir
Abstract: Analog codes add redundancy by expanding the dimension using real/complex-valued operations. Frame theory provides a mathematical basis for constructing such codes, with diverse applications in non-orthogonal code-division multiple access (NOMA-CDMA), distributed computation, multiple description source coding, space-time coding (STC), and more. The channel model corresponding to these applications is a combination of noise and erasures. Recent analyses showed a useful connection between spectral random-matrix theory and large equiangular tight frames (ETFs) under random uniform erasures. In this work we generalize this model to a channel where the erasures come in blocks. This particularly fits NOMA-CDMA with multiple transmit antennas for each user and STC with known spatial grouping. We present a method to adjust ETF codes to suit block erasures, and find minimum intra-block-correlation frames which outperform ETFs in this setting.

Title: Improving Zero-Shot Chinese-English Code-Switching ASR with kNN-CTC and Gated Monolingual Datastores
Authors: Jiaming Zhou, Shiwan Zhao, Hui Wang, Tian-Hao Zhang, Haoqin Sun, Xuechen Wang, Yong Qin
Abstract: The kNN-CTC model has proven to be effective for monolingual automatic speech recognition (ASR). However, its direct application to multilingual scenarios like code-switching, presents challenges. Although there is potential for performance improvement, a kNN-CTC model utilizing a single bilingual datastore can inadvertently introduce undesirable noise from the alternative language. To address this, we propose a novel kNN-CTC-based code-switching ASR (CS-ASR) framework that employs dual monolingual datastores and a gated datastore selection mechanism to reduce noise interference. Our method selects the appropriate datastore for decoding each frame, ensuring the injection of language-specific information into the ASR process. We apply this framework to cutting-edge CTC-based models, developing an advanced CS-ASR system. Extensive experiments demonstrate the remarkable effectiveness of our gated datastore mechanism in enhancing the performance of zero-shot Chinese-English CS-ASR.

Title: CMAR-Net: Accurate Cross-Modal 3D SAR Reconstruction of Vehicle Targets with Sparse Multi-Baseline Data
Authors: Da Li, Guoqiang Zhao, Houjun Sun, Jiacheng Bao
Abstract: Multi-baseline Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) three-dimensional (3D) tomography is a crucial remote sensing technique that provides 3D resolution unavailable in conventional SAR imaging. However, achieving high-quality imaging typically requires multi-angle or full-aperture data, resulting in significant imaging costs. Recent advancements in sparse 3D SAR, which rely on data from limited apertures, have gained attention as a cost-effective alternative. Notably, deep learning techniques have markedly enhanced the imaging quality of sparse 3D SAR. Despite these advancements, existing methods primarily depend on high-resolution radar images for supervising the training of deep neural networks (DNNs). This exclusive dependence on single-modal data prevents the introduction of complementary information from other data sources, limiting further improvements in imaging performance. In this paper, we introduce a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) to enhance 3D SAR imaging by integrating heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error transfer guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse multi-baseline SAR data into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Extensive experiments on simulated and real-world datasets demonstrate that CMAR-Net significantly outperforms SOTA sparse reconstruction algorithms based on compressed sensing (CS) and deep learning (DL). Furthermore, our method eliminates the need for time-consuming full-aperture data preprocessing and relies solely on computer-rendered optical images, significantly reducing dataset construction costs. This work highlights the potential of deep learning for multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research through cross-modal learning.

Title: Monotone Lipschitz-Gradient Denoiser: Explainability of Operator Regularization Approaches Free From Lipschitz Constant Control
Authors: Masahiro Yukawa, Isao Yamada
Abstract: This paper addresses explainability of the operator-regularization approach under the use of monotone Lipschitz-gradient (MoL-Grad) denoiser -- an operator that can be expressed as the Lipschitz continuous gradient of a differentiable convex function. We prove that an operator is a MoL-Grad denoiser if and only if it is the ``single-valued'' proximity operator of a weakly convex function. An extension of Moreau's decomposition is also shown with respect to a weakly convex function and the conjugate of its convexified function. Under these arguments, two specific algorithms, the forward-backward splitting algorithm and the primal-dual splitting algorithm, are considered, both employing MoL-Grad denoisers. These algorithms generate a sequence of vectors converging weakly, under conditions, to a minimizer of a certain cost function which involves an ``implicit regularizer'' induced by the denoiser. Unlike the previous studies of operator regularization, our framework requires no control of the Lipschitz constant in learning the denoiser. The theoretical findings are supported by simulations.

Title: Learning to Control Unknown Strongly Monotone Games
Authors: Siddharth Chandak, Ilai Bistritz, Nicholas Bambos
Abstract: Consider a game where the players' utility functions include a reward function and a linear term for each dimension, with coefficients that are controlled by the manager. We assume that the game is strongly monotone, so gradient play converges to a unique Nash equilibrium (NE). The NE is typically globally inefficient. The global performance at NE can be improved by imposing linear constraints on the NE. We therefore want the manager to pick the controlled coefficients that impose the desired constraint on the NE. However, this requires knowing the players' reward functions and action sets. Obtaining this game information is infeasible in a large-scale network and violates user privacy. To overcome this, we propose a simple algorithm that learns to shift the NE to meet the linear constraints by adjusting the controlled coefficients online. Our algorithm only requires the linear constraints violation as feedback and does not need to know the reward functions or the action sets. We prove that our algorithm converges with probability 1 to the set of NE that satisfy target linear constraints. We then prove an L2 convergence rate of near-$O(t^{-1/4})$.

Title: USV-AUV Collaboration Framework for Underwater Tasks under Extreme Sea Conditions
Authors: Jingzehua Xu, Guanwen Xie, Xinqi Wang, Yimian Ding, Shuai Zhang
Abstract: Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) are valuable for ocean exploration due to their flexibility and ability to carry communication and detection units. Nevertheless, AUVs alone often face challenges in harsh and extreme sea conditions. This study introduces a unmanned surface vehicle (USV)-AUV collaboration framework, which includes high-precision multi-AUV positioning using USV path planning via Fisher information matrix optimization and reinforcement learning for multi-AUV cooperative tasks. Applied to a multi-AUV underwater data collection task scenario, extensive simulations validate the framework's feasibility and superior performance, highlighting exceptional coordination and robustness under extreme sea conditions. To accelerate relevant research in this field, we have made the simulation code (demo version) available as open-source.

Title: Learning Optimal Stable Matches in Decentralized Markets with Unknown Preferences
Authors: Vade Shah, Bryce L. Ferguson, Jason R. Marden
Abstract: Matching algorithms have demonstrated great success in several practical applications, but they often require centralized coordination and plentiful information. In many modern online marketplaces, agents must independently seek out and match with another using little to no information. For these kinds of settings, can we design decentralized, limited-information matching algorithms that preserve the desirable properties of standard centralized techniques? In this work, we constructively answer this question in the affirmative. We model a two-sided matching market as a game consisting of two disjoint sets of agents, referred to as proposers and acceptors, each of whom seeks to match with their most preferable partner on the opposite side of the market. However, each proposer has no knowledge of their own preferences, so they must learn their preferences while forming matches in the market. We present a simple online learning rule that guarantees a strong notion of probabilistic convergence to the welfare-maximizing equilibrium of the game, referred to as the proposer-optimal stable match. To the best of our knowledge, this represents the first completely decoupled, communication-free algorithm that guarantees probabilistic convergence to an optimal stable match, irrespective of the structure of the matching market.

Title: Subband Splitting: Simple, Efficient and Effective Technique for Solving Block Permutation Problem in Determined Blind Source Separation
Authors: Kazuki Matsumoto, Kohei Yatabe
Abstract: Solving the permutation problem is essential for determined blind source separation (BSS). Existing methods, such as independent vector analysis (IVA) and independent low-rank matrix analysis (ILRMA), tackle the permutation problem by modeling the co-occurrence of the frequency components of source signals. One of the remaining challenges in these methods is the block permutation problem, which may cause severe performance degradation. In this paper, we propose a simple and effective technique for solving the block permutation problem. The proposed technique splits the entire frequency bands into several overlapping subbands and sequentially applies BSS methods (e.g., IVA, ILRMA, or any other method) to each subband. Since the splitting reduces the size of the problem, the BSS methods can effectively work in each subband. Then, the permutations among the subbands are aligned by using the separation result in one subband as the initial values for the other subbands. Additionally, we propose SS-IVA and SS-ILRMA by combining subband splitting with IVA and ILRMA. Experimental results demonstrated that our technique remarkably improves the separation performance without increasing computational cost. In particular, our SS-ILRMA archived the separation performance comparable to the oracle method (frequency-domain independent component analysis with the ideal permutation solver). Moreover, SS-ILRMA converged faster than conventional IVA and ILRMA.

Title: MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding
Authors: Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.

Title: What Are They Doing? Joint Audio-Speech Co-Reasoning
Authors: Yingzhi Wang, Pooneh Mousavi, Artem Ploujnikov, Mirco Ravanelli
Abstract: In audio and speech processing, tasks usually focus on either the audio or speech modality, even when both sounds and human speech are present in the same audio clip. Recent Auditory Large Language Models (ALLMs) have made it possible to process audio and speech simultaneously within a single model, leading to further considerations of joint audio-speech tasks. In this paper, we establish a novel benchmark to investigate how well ALLMs can perform joint audio-speech processing. Specifically, we introduce Joint Audio-Speech Co-Reasoning (JASCO), a novel task that unifies audio and speech processing, strictly requiring co-reasoning across both modalities. We also release a scene-reasoning dataset called "What Are They Doing". Additionally, we provide deeper insights into the models' behaviors by analyzing their dependence on each modality.

Title: A Critical Assessment of Visual Sound Source Localization Models Including Negative Audio
Authors: Xavier Juanola, Gloria Haro, Magdalena Fuentes
Abstract: The task of Visual Sound Source Localization (VSSL) involves identifying the location of sound sources in visual scenes, integrating audio-visual data for enhanced scene understanding. Despite advancements in state-of-the-art (SOTA) models, we observe three critical flaws: i) The evaluation of the models is mainly focused in sounds produced by objects that are visible in the image, ii) The evaluation often assumes a prior knowledge of the size of the sounding object, and iii) No universal threshold for localization in real-world scenarios is established, as previous approaches only consider positive examples without accounting for both positive and negative cases. In this paper, we introduce a novel test set and metrics designed to complete the current standard evaluation of VSSL models by testing them in scenarios where none of the objects in the image corresponds to the audio input, i.e. a negative audio. We consider three types of negative audio: silence, noise and offscreen. Our analysis reveals that numerous SOTA models fail to appropriately adjust their predictions based on audio input, suggesting that these models may not be leveraging audio information as intended. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive analysis of the range of maximum values in the estimated audio-visual similarity maps, in both positive and negative audio cases, and show that most of the models are not discriminative enough, making them unfit to choose a universal threshold appropriate to perform sound localization without any a priori information of the sounding object, that is, object size and visibility.

Abstract: This study offers a revolutionary strategy to developing wheelchairs based on the Brain-Computer Interface (BCI) that incorporates Artificial Intelligence (AI) using a The device uses electroencephalogram (EEG) data to mimic wheelchair navigation. Five different models were trained on a pre-filtered dataset that was divided into fixed-length windows using a sliding window technique. Each window contained statistical measurements, FFT coefficients for different frequency bands, and a label identifying the activity carried out during that window that was taken from an open-source Kaggle repository. The XGBoost model outperformed the other models, CatBoost, GRU, SVC, and XGBoost, with an accuracy of 60%. The CatBoost model with a major difference between training and testing accuracy shows overfitting, and similarly, the best-performing model, with SVC, was implemented in a tkinter GUI. The wheelchair movement could be simulated in various directions, and a Raspberry Pi-powered wheelchair system for brain-computer interface is proposed here.

Authors: Jilong Wang, Javokhirbek Rajabov, Chaoyi Xu, Yiming Zheng, He Wang
Abstract: Legged robots with advanced manipulation capabilities have the potential to significantly improve household duties and urban maintenance. Despite considerable progress in developing robust locomotion and precise manipulation methods, seamlessly integrating these into cohesive whole-body control for real-world applications remains challenging. In this paper, we present a modular framework for robust and generalizable whole-body loco-manipulation controller based on a single arm-mounted camera. By using reinforcement learning (RL), we enable a robust low-level policy for command execution over 5 dimensions (5D) and a grasp-aware high-level policy guided by a novel metric, Generalized Oriented Reachability Map (GORM). The proposed system achieves state-of-the-art one-time grasping accuracy of 89% in the real world, including challenging tasks such as grasping transparent objects. Through extensive simulations and real-world experiments, we demonstrate that our system can effectively manage a large workspace, from floor level to above body height, and perform diverse whole-body loco-manipulation tasks.

Title: Efficient Estimation of Relaxed Model Parameters for Robust UAV Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Derek Fan, David A. Copp
Abstract: Online trajectory optimization and optimal control methods are crucial for enabling sustainable unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) services, such as agriculture, environmental monitoring, and transportation, where available actuation and energy are limited. However, optimal controllers are highly sensitive to model mismatch, which can occur due to loaded equipment, packages to be delivered, or pre-existing variability in fundamental structural and thrust-related parameters. To circumvent this problem, optimal controllers can be paired with parameter estimators to improve their trajectory planning performance and perform adaptive control. However, UAV platforms are limited in terms of onboard processing power, oftentimes making nonlinear parameter estimation too computationally expensive to consider. To address these issues, we propose a relaxed, affine-in-parameters multirotor model along with an efficient optimal parameter estimator. We convexify the nominal Moving Horizon Parameter Estimation (MHPE) problem into a linear-quadratic form (LQ-MHPE) via an affine-in-parameter relaxation on the nonlinear dynamics, resulting in fast quadratic programs (QPs) that facilitate adaptive Model Predictve Control (MPC) in real time. We compare this approach to the equivalent nonlinear estimator in Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating a decrease in average solve time and trajectory optimality cost by 98.2% and 23.9-56.2%, respectively.

Title: The Sound of Water: Inferring Physical Properties from Pouring Liquids
Authors: Piyush Bagad, Makarand Tapaswi, Cees G. M. Snoek, Andrew Zisserman
Abstract: We study the connection between audio-visual observations and the underlying physics of a mundane yet intriguing everyday activity: pouring liquids. Given only the sound of liquid pouring into a container, our objective is to automatically infer physical properties such as the liquid level, the shape and size of the container, the pouring rate and the time to fill. To this end, we: (i) show in theory that these properties can be determined from the fundamental frequency (pitch); (ii) train a pitch detection model with supervision from simulated data and visual data with a physics-inspired objective; (iii) introduce a new large dataset of real pouring videos for a systematic study; (iv) show that the trained model can indeed infer these physical properties for real data; and finally, (v) we demonstrate strong generalization to various container shapes, other datasets, and in-the-wild YouTube videos. Our work presents a keen understanding of a narrow yet rich problem at the intersection of acoustics, physics, and learning. It opens up applications to enhance multisensory perception in robotic pouring.

Title: Asynchronous Federated Learning: A Scalable Approach for Decentralized Machine Learning
Authors: Ali Forootani, Raffaele Iervolino
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for decentralized machine learning, enabling collaborative model training across diverse clients without sharing raw data. However, traditional FL approaches often face limitations in scalability and efficiency due to their reliance on synchronous client updates, which can result in significant delays and increased communication overhead, particularly in heterogeneous and dynamic environments. To address these challenges in this paper, we propose an Asynchronous Federated Learning (AFL) algorithm, which allows clients to update the global model independently and asynchronously. Our key contributions include a comprehensive convergence analysis of AFL in the presence of client delays and model staleness. By leveraging martingale difference sequence theory and variance bounds, we ensure robust convergence despite asynchronous updates. Assuming strongly convex local objective functions, we establish bounds on gradient variance under random client sampling and derive a recursion formula quantifying the impact of client delays on convergence. The proposed AFL algorithm addresses key limitations of traditional FL methods, such as inefficiency due to global synchronization and susceptibility to client drift. It enhances scalability, robustness, and efficiency in real-world settings with heterogeneous client populations and dynamic network conditions. Our results underscore the potential of AFL to drive advancements in distributed learning systems, particularly for large-scale, privacy-preserving applications in resource-constrained environments.

Title: Machine-Learning Enabled Multidimensional Data Utilization in Multi-Resonance Biosensors: A Pathway to Enhanced Accuracy
Authors: Majid Aalizadeh, Morteza Azmoudeh Afshar, Xudong Fan
Abstract: A novel framework is proposed that combines multi-resonance biosensors with machine learning (ML) to significantly enhance the accuracy of parameter prediction in biosensing. Unlike traditional single-resonance systems, which are limited to one-dimensional datasets, this approach leverages multi-dimensional data generated by a custom-designed nanostructure, a periodic array of silicon nanorods with a triangular cross-section over an aluminum reflector. High bulk sensitivity values are achieved for this multi-resonant structure, with certain resonant peaks reaching up to 1706 nm/RIU. The predictive power of multiple resonant peaks from transverse magnetic (TM) and transverse electric (TE) polarizations is evaluated using Ridge Regression modeling. Systematic analysis reveals that incorporating multiple resonances yields up to three orders of magnitude improvement in refractive index detection precision compared to single-peak analyses. This precision enhancement is achieved without modifications to the biosensor hardware, highlighting the potential of data-centric strategies in biosensing. The findings establish a new paradigm in biosensing, demonstrating that the synergy between multi-resonance data acquisition and ML-based analysis can significantly enhance detection accuracy. This study provides a scalable pathway for advancing high-precision biosensing technologies.

Title: Diffusion Prism: Enhancing Diversity and Morphology Consistency in Mask-to-Image Diffusion
Authors: Hao Wang, Xiwen Chen, Ashish Bastola, Jiayou Qin, Abolfazl Razi
Abstract: The emergence of generative AI and controllable diffusion has made image-to-image synthesis increasingly practical and efficient. However, when input images exhibit low entropy and sparse, the inherent characteristics of diffusion models often result in limited diversity. This constraint significantly interferes with data augmentation. To address this, we propose Diffusion Prism, a training-free framework that efficiently transforms binary masks into realistic and diverse samples while preserving morphological features. We explored that a small amount of artificial noise will significantly assist the image-denoising process. To prove this novel mask-to-image concept, we use nano-dendritic patterns as an example to demonstrate the merit of our method compared to existing controllable diffusion models. Furthermore, we extend the proposed framework to other biological patterns, highlighting its potential applications across various fields.

Title: Advancing Singlish Understanding: Bridging the Gap with Datasets and Multimodal Models
Authors: Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Shuo Sun, Wenyu Zhang, Yingxu He, Zhuohan Liu, Chengwei Wei, Nancy F. Chen, AiTi Aw
Abstract: Singlish, a Creole language rooted in English, is a key focus in linguistic research within multilingual and multicultural contexts. However, its spoken form remains underexplored, limiting insights into its linguistic structure and applications. To address this gap, we standardize and annotate the largest spoken Singlish corpus, introducing the Multitask National Speech Corpus (MNSC). These datasets support diverse tasks, including Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Spoken Question Answering (SQA), Spoken Dialogue Summarization (SDS), and Paralinguistic Question Answering (PQA). We release standardized splits and a human-verified test set to facilitate further research. Additionally, we propose SingAudioLLM, a multi-task multimodal model leveraging multimodal large language models to handle these tasks concurrently. Experiments reveal our models adaptability to Singlish context, achieving state-of-the-art performance and outperforming prior models by 10-30% in comparison with other AudioLLMs and cascaded solutions.

Title: Effective and Efficient Mixed Precision Quantization of Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Haoning Xu, Zhaoqing Li, Zengrui Jin, Huimeng Wang, Youjun Chen, Guinan Li, Mengzhe Geng, Shujie Hu, Jiajun Deng, Xunying Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel mixed-precision quantization approach for speech foundation models that tightly integrates mixed-precision learning and quantized model parameter estimation into one single model compression stage. Experiments conducted on LibriSpeech dataset with fine-tuned wav2vec2.0-base and HuBERT-large models suggest the resulting mixed-precision quantized models increased the lossless compression ratio by factors up to 1.7x and 1.9x over the respective uniform-precision and two-stage mixed-precision quantized baselines that perform precision learning and model parameters quantization in separate and disjointed stages, while incurring no statistically word error rate (WER) increase over the 32-bit full-precision models. The system compression time of wav2vec2.0-base and HuBERT-large models is reduced by up to 1.9 and 1.5 times over the two-stage mixed-precision baselines, while both produce lower WERs. The best-performing 3.5-bit mixed-precision quantized HuBERT-large model produces a lossless compression ratio of 8.6x over the 32-bit full-precision system.

Title: D3RM: A Discrete Denoising Diffusion Refinement Model for Piano Transcription
Authors: Hounsu Kim, Taegyun Kwon, Juhan Nam
Abstract: Diffusion models have been widely used in the generative domain due to their convincing performance in modeling complex data distributions. Moreover, they have shown competitive results on discriminative tasks, such as image segmentation. While diffusion models have also been explored for automatic music transcription, their performance has yet to reach a competitive level. In this paper, we focus on discrete diffusion model's refinement capabilities and present a novel architecture for piano transcription. Our model utilizes Neighborhood Attention layers as the denoising module, gradually predicting the target high-resolution piano roll, conditioned on the finetuned features of a pretrained acoustic model. To further enhance refinement, we devise a novel strategy which applies distinct transition states during training and inference stage of discrete diffusion models. Experiments on the MAESTRO dataset show that our approach outperforms previous diffusion-based piano transcription models and the baseline model in terms of F1 score.
