Title: Collaborative design of fault diagnosis and fault tolerance control under nested signal temporal logic specifications
Authors: Penghong Lu, Gang Chen, Rong Su
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) specifications play a crucial role in defining complex temporal properties and behaviors in safety-critical cyber-physical systems (CPS). However, fault diagnosis (FD) and fault-tolerant control (FTC) for CPS with nonlinear dynamics remain significant challenges, particularly when dealing with nested signal temporal logic (NSTL) specifications. This paper introduces a novel framework for the collaborative design of FD and FTC, aimed at optimizing fault diagnostic performance while ensuring fault tolerance under NSTL specifications. The proposed framework consists of four key steps: (1) construction of the Signal Temporal Logic Tree (STLT), (2) fault detection via the construction of fault-tolerant feasible sets, (3) evaluation of fault detection performance, and (4) synthesis of fault-tolerant control. Initially, a controller for nonlinear systems is designed to satisfy NSTL specifications, and a fault detection observer is developed alongside fault-tolerant feasible sets. To address the challenge of maintaining solution feasibility in dynamic optimization control problems, the concept of fault-tolerant control recursive feasibility is introduced. Subsequently, suboptimal controller gains are derived through a quadratic programming approach to ensure fault tolerance. The collaborative design framework enables more rapid and accurate fault detection while preserving FTC performance. A simulation study is presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework.

Title: Collaborative Drill Alignment in Surgical Robotics
Authors: Daniel Larby, Joshua Kershaw, Matthew Allen, Fulvio Forni
Abstract: Robotic assistance allows surgeries to be reliably and accurately executed while still under direct supervision of the surgeon, combining the strengths of robotic technology with the surgeon's expertise. This paper describes a robotic system designed to assist in surgical procedures by implementing a virtual drill guide. The system integrates virtual-fixture functionality using a novel virtual-mechanism controller with additional visual feedback. The controller constrains the tool to the desired axis, while allowing axial motion to remain under the surgeon's control. Compared to prior virtual-fixture approaches -- which primarily perform pure energy-shaping and damping injection with linear springs and dampers -- our controller uses a virtual prismatic joint to which the robot is constrained by nonlinear springs, allowing us to easily shape the dynamics of the system. We detail the calibration procedures required to achieve sufficient precision, and describe the implementation of the controller. We apply this system to a veterinary procedure: drilling for transcondylar screw placement in dogs. The results of the trials on 3D-printed bone models demonstrate sufficient precision to perform the procedure and suggest improved angular accuracy and reduced exit translation errors compared to patient specific guides (PSG). Discussion and future improvements follow.

Title: Ro-To-Go! Robust Reactive Control with Signal Temporal Logic
Authors: Roland Ilyes, Lara Bruderm√ºller, Nick Hawes, Bruno Lacerda
Abstract: Signal Temporal Logic (STL) robustness is a common objective for optimal robot control, but its dependence on history limits the robot's decision-making capabilities when used in Model Predictive Control (MPC) approaches. In this work, we introduce Signal Temporal Logic robustness-to-go (Ro-To-Go), a new quantitative semantics for the logic that isolates the contributions of suffix trajectories. We prove its relationship to formula progression for Metric Temporal Logic, and show that the robustness-to-go depends only on the suffix trajectory and progressed formula. We implement robustness-to-go as the objective in an MPC algorithm and use formula progression to efficiently evaluate it online. We test the algorithm in simulation and compare it to MPC using traditional STL robustness. Our experiments show that using robustness-to-go results in a higher success rate.

Title: Fault Localization and State Estimation of Power Grid under Parallel Cyber-Physical Attacks
Authors: Junhao Ren, Kai Zhao, Guangxiao Zhang, Xinghua Liu, Chao Zhai, Gaoxi Xiao
Abstract: Parallel cyber-physical attacks (PCPA) refer to those attacks on power grids by disturbing/cutting off physical transmission lines and meanwhile blocking transmission of measurement data to dwarf or delay the system protection and recovery actions. Such fierce hostile attacks impose critical threats to the modern power grids when there is a fusion of power grids and telecommunication technologies. In this paper, we investigate the fault diagnosis problem of faulty transmission lines under a broader spectrum of PCPA for a linearized (or DC) power flow model. The physical attack mechanism of PCPA includes not only disconnection but also admittance value modification on transmission lines, for example, by invading distributed flexible AC transmission system (D-FACTS). To tackle the problem, we first recover the information of voltage phase angles within the attacked area. Using the information of voltage phase angle and power injection of buses, a graph attention network-based fault localization (GAT-FL) algorithm is proposed to find the locations of the physical attacks. By capitalizing on the feature extraction capability of the GAT on graph data, the fault localization algorithm outperforms the existing results when under cyber attacks, e.g., denial of service (DoS) attacks. A line state identification algorithm is then developed to identify the states of the transmission lines within the attacked area. Specifically, the algorithm restores the power injection of buses within the attacked area and then identities the state of all the transmission lines within the attacked area by solving a linear programming (LP) problem. Experimental simulations are effectiveness of the proposed fault diagnosis algorithms.

Authors: Mostafa Ahmed (1), Mohamed Khaled (1), Abdelrahman Ali (1), Amr Mostafa (1), Mariam Mohamed (1), Omar Ahmed (1), Osama Khalil (1) ((1) Egypt-Japan University of Science and Technology, Egypt)
Abstract: The hot-rolling process is a critical stage in sheet metal production within the heavy steel industry. Traditionally, parameter adjustments such as sheet metal velocity and roll gap are performed manually, leading to inefficiencies and limited precision. This project introduces an integrated mechatronics system designed to automate the control of rolling speed and sheet metal thickness, enhancing efficiency, consistency, and quality. The proposed system consists of a pair of rolls applying compression loads, with a mechanism for gap control, suitable motors and sensors, and dynamic modeling to optimize performance. Through simulation and practical implementation strategies, we demonstrate the feasibility of automating the hot-rolling process. By integrating mechatronics, this solution aims to modernize sheet metal production, improve productivity, and enhance product quality in the steel industry.

Title: From Target Tracking to Targeting Track -- Part III: Stochastic Process Modeling and Online Learning
Authors: Tiancheng Li, Jingyuan Wang, Guchong Li, Dengwei Gao
Abstract: This is the third part of a series of studies that model the target trajectory, which describes the target state evolution over continuous time, as a sample path of a stochastic process (SP). By adopting a deterministic-stochastic decomposition framework, we decompose the learning of the trajectory SP into two sequential stages: the first fits the deterministic trend of the trajectory using a curve function of time, while the second estimates the residual stochastic component through parametric learning of either a Gaussian process (GP) or Student's-$t$ process (StP). This leads to a Markov-free data-driven tracking approach that produces the continuous-time trajectory with minimal prior knowledge of the target dynamics. Notably, our approach explicitly models both the temporal correlations of the state sequence and of measurement noises through the SP framework. It does not only take advantage of the smooth trend of the target but also makes use of the long-term temporal correlation of both the data noise and the model fitting error. Simulations in four maneuvering target tracking scenarios have demonstrated its effectiveness and superiority in comparison with existing approaches.

Title: Illuminant and light direction estimation using Wasserstein distance method
Authors: Selcuk Yazar
Abstract: Illumination estimation remains a pivotal challenge in image processing, particularly for robotics, where robust environmental perception is essential under varying lighting conditions. Traditional approaches, such as RGB histograms and GIST descriptors, often fail in complex scenarios due to their sensitivity to illumination changes. This study introduces a novel method utilizing the Wasserstein distance, rooted in optimal transport theory, to estimate illuminant and light direction in images. Experiments on diverse images indoor scenes, black-and-white photographs, and night images demonstrate the method's efficacy in detecting dominant light sources and estimating their directions, outperforming traditional statistical methods in complex lighting environments. The approach shows promise for applications in light source localization, image quality assessment, and object detection enhancement. Future research may explore adaptive thresholding and integrate gradient analysis to enhance accuracy, offering a scalable solution for real-world illumination challenges in robotics and beyond.

Title: An Unsupervised C-Uniform Trajectory Sampler with Applications to Model Predictive Path Integral Control
Authors: O. Goktug Poyrazoglu, Rahul Moorthy, Yukang Cao, William Chastek, Volkan Isler
Abstract: Sampling-based model predictive controllers generate trajectories by sampling control inputs from a fixed, simple distribution such as the normal or uniform distributions. This sampling method yields trajectory samples that are tightly clustered around a mean trajectory. This clustering behavior in turn, limits the exploration capability of the controller and reduces the likelihood of finding feasible solutions in complex environments. Recent work has attempted to address this problem by either reshaping the resulting trajectory distribution or increasing the sample entropy to enhance diversity and promote exploration. In our recent work, we introduced the concept of C-Uniform trajectory generation [1] which allows the computation of control input probabilities to generate trajectories that sample the configuration space uniformly. In this work, we first address the main limitation of this method: lack of scalability due to computational complexity. We introduce Neural C-Uniform, an unsupervised C-Uniform trajectory sampler that mitigates scalability issues by computing control input probabilities without relying on a discretized configuration space. Experiments show that Neural C-Uniform achieves a similar uniformity ratio to the original C-Uniform approach and generates trajectories over a longer time horizon while preserving uniformity. Next, we present CU-MPPI, which integrates Neural C-Uniform sampling into existing MPPI variants. We analyze the performance of CU-MPPI in simulation and real-world experiments. Our results indicate that in settings where the optimal solution has high curvature, CU-MPPI leads to drastic improvements in performance.

Title: Synthesis of Functional Unknown Input Observers for LTV and MIMO LTI Systems with Arbitrary Relative Degree
Authors: Alexey A. Margun, Alexey A. Bobtsov, Denis V. Efimov, Alexandr D. Panin, Mariia O. Rassolova
Abstract: This article focuses on the development of functional unknown input observers for systems with arbitrary relative degree. Two distinct approaches are presented to address this challenge. The first approach is tailored to a class of time-varying systems expressed in a canonical controllable form. This method leverages the Generalized Parameter Estimation-Based Observer framework. The article derives the conditions for applicability of this solution and outlines the limitations on the number of estimable state variables. The second approach targets multi-input multi-output systems. In contrast to existing methods, the proposed solution is applicable to systems with arbitrary relative degree, significantly broadening its scope of application. The theoretical results are validated through simulation studies, which demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed observers.

Title: A Novel Control Strategy for Offset Points Tracking in the Context of Agricultural Robotics
Authors: Stephane Ngnepiepaye Wembe, Vincent Rousseau, Johann Laconte, Roland Lenain
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method to control a rigidly connected location on the vehicle, such as a point on the implement in case of agricultural tasks. Agricultural robots are transforming modern farming by enabling precise and efficient operations, replacing humans in arduous tasks while reducing the use of chemicals. Traditionnaly, path_following algorithms are designed to guide the vehicle's center along a predefined trajetory. However, since the actual agronomic task is performed by the implement, it is essential to control a specific point on the implement itself rather than vehicle's center. As such, we present in this paper two approaches for achieving the control of an offset point on the robot. The first approach adapts existing control laws, initially inteded for rear axle's midpoint, to manage the desired lateral deviation. The second approach employs backstepping control techniques to create a control law that directly targets the implement. We conduct real-world experiments, highlighting the limitations of traditional approaches for offset points control, and demonstrating the strengths and weaknesses of the proposed methods.

Title: Safe Distributed Learning-Enhanced Predictive Control for Multiple Quadrupedal Robots
Authors: Weishu Zhan, Zheng Liang, Hongyu Song, Wei Pan
Abstract: Quadrupedal robots exhibit remarkable adaptability in unstructured environments, making them well-suited for formation control in real-world applications. However, keeping stable formations while ensuring collision-free navigation presents significant challenges due to dynamic obstacles, communication constraints, and the complexity of legged locomotion. This paper proposes a distributed model predictive control framework for multi-quadruped formation control, integrating Control Lyapunov Functions to ensure formation stability and Control Barrier Functions for decentralized safety enforcement. To address the challenge of dynamically changing team structures, we introduce Scale-Adaptive Permutation-Invariant Encoding (SAPIE), which enables robust feature encoding of neighboring robots while preserving permutation invariance. Additionally, we develop a low-latency Data Distribution Service-based communication protocol and an event-triggered deadlock resolution mechanism to enhance real-time coordination and prevent motion stagnation in constrained spaces. Our framework is validated through high-fidelity simulations in NVIDIA Omniverse Isaac Sim and real-world experiments using our custom quadrupedal robotic system, XG. Results demonstrate stable formation control, real-time feasibility, and effective collision avoidance, validating its potential for large-scale deployment.

Title: Enhanced Koopman Operator Approximation for Nonlinear Systems Using Broading Learning System
Authors: Yangjun Sun, Zhiliang Liu
Abstract: Traditional control methods often show limitations in dealing with complex nonlinear systems, especially when it is difficult to accurately obtain the exact system model, and the control accuracy and stability are difficult to guarantee. To solve this problem, the Koopman operator theory provides an effective method to linearise nonlinear systems, which simplifies the analysis and control of the system by mapping the nonlinear dynamics into a high-dimensional space. However, the existing extended dynamical mode decomposition (EDMD) methods suffer from randomness in the selection of basis functions, which leads to bias in the finite-dimensional approximation to the Koopman operator, thus affecting the accuracy of model prediction. To solve this problem, this paper proposes a BLS-EDMD method based on the Broad learning system (BLS) network. The method achieves a high-precision approximation to the Koopman operator by learning more accurate basis functions, which significantly improves the prediction ability of the model. Building on this, we further develop a model predictive controller (MPC) called BE-MPC. This controller directly utilises the high-dimensional and high-precision predictors generated by BLS-EDMD to predict the system state more accurately, thus achieving precise control of the underwater unmanned vehicle (UUV), and its effectiveness is verified by simulation.

Title: SAS: Segment Anything Small for Ultrasound -- A Non-Generative Data Augmentation Technique for Robust Deep Learning in Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Danielle L. Ferreira, Ahana Gangopadhyay, Hsi-Ming Chang, Ravi Soni, Gopal Avinash
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of anatomical structures in ultrasound (US) images, particularly small ones, is challenging due to noise and variability in imaging conditions (e.g., probe position, patient anatomy, tissue characteristics and pathology). To address this, we introduce Segment Anything Small (SAS), a simple yet effective scale- and texture-aware data augmentation technique designed to enhance the performance of deep learning models for segmenting small anatomical structures in ultrasound images. SAS employs a dual transformation strategy: (1) simulating diverse organ scales by resizing and embedding organ thumbnails into a black background, and (2) injecting noise into regions of interest to simulate varying tissue textures. These transformations generate realistic and diverse training data without introducing hallucinations or artifacts, improving the model's robustness to noise and variability. We fine-tuned a promptable foundation model on a controlled organ-specific medical imaging dataset and evaluated its performance on one internal and five external datasets. Experimental results demonstrate significant improvements in segmentation performance, with Dice score gains of up to 0.35 and an average improvement of 0.16 [95% CI 0.132,0.188]. Additionally, our iterative point prompts provide precise control and adaptive refinement, achieving performance comparable to bounding box prompts with just two points. SAS enhances model robustness and generalizability across diverse anatomical structures and imaging conditions, particularly for small structures, without compromising the accuracy of larger ones. By offering a computationally efficient solution that eliminates the need for extensive human labeling efforts, SAS emerges as a powerful tool for advancing medical image analysis, particularly in resource-constrained settings.

Title: Beyond H&E: Unlocking Pathological Insights with Polarization via Self-supervised Learning
Authors: Yao Du, Jiaxin Zhuang, Xiaoyu Zheng, Jing Cong, Limei Guo, Chao He, Lin Luo, Xiaomeng Li
Abstract: Histopathology image analysis is fundamental to digital pathology, with hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) staining as the gold standard for diagnostic and prognostic assessments. While H&E imaging effectively highlights cellular and tissue structures, it lacks sensitivity to birefringence and tissue anisotropy, which are crucial for assessing collagen organization, fiber alignment, and microstructural alterations--key indicators of tumor progression, fibrosis, and other pathological conditions. To bridge this gap, we propose PolarHE, a dual modality fusion framework that integrates H&E with polarization imaging, leveraging the polarization ability to enhance tissue characterization. Our approach employs a feature decomposition strategy to disentangle common and modality specific features, ensuring effective multimodal representation learning. Through comprehensive validation, our approach significantly outperforms previous methods, achieving an accuracy of 86.70% on the Chaoyang dataset and 89.06% on the MHIST dataset. Moreover, polarization property visualization reveals distinct optical signatures of pathological tissues, highlighting its diagnostic potential. t-SNE visualizations further confirm our model effectively captures both shared and unique modality features, reinforcing the complementary nature of polarization imaging. These results demonstrate that polarization imaging is a powerful and underutilized modality in computational pathology, enriching feature representation and improving diagnostic accuracy. PolarHE establishes a promising direction for multimodal learning, paving the way for more interpretable and generalizable pathology models. Our code will be released after paper acceptance.

Title: Enhanced Denoising and Convergent Regularisation Using Tweedie Scaling
Authors: Na√Øl Khelifa, Ferdia Sherry, Carola-Bibiane Sch√∂nlieb
Abstract: The inherent ill-posed nature of image reconstruction problems, due to limitations in the physical acquisition process, is typically addressed by introducing a regularisation term that incorporates prior knowledge about the underlying image. The iterative framework of Plug-and-Play methods, specifically designed for tackling such inverse problems, achieves state-of-the-art performance by replacing the regularisation with a generic denoiser, which may be parametrised by a neural network architecture. However, these deep learning approaches suffer from a critical limitation: the absence of a control parameter to modulate the regularisation strength, which complicates the design of a convergent regularisation. To address this issue, this work introduces a novel scaling method that explicitly integrates and adjusts the strength of regularisation. The scaling parameter enhances interpretability by reflecting the quality of the denoiser's learning process, and also systematically improves its optimisation. Furthermore, the proposed approach ensures that the resulting family of regularisations is provably stable and convergent.

Title: LapLoss: Laplacian Pyramid-based Multiscale loss for Image Translation
Authors: Krish Didwania, Ishaan Gakhar, Prakhar Arya, Sanskriti Labroo
Abstract: Contrast enhancement, a key aspect of image-to-image translation (I2IT), improves visual quality by adjusting intensity differences between pixels. However, many existing methods struggle to preserve fine-grained details, often leading to the loss of low-level features. This paper introduces LapLoss, a novel approach designed for I2IT contrast enhancement, based on the Laplacian pyramid-centric networks, forming the core of our proposed methodology. The proposed approach employs a multiple discriminator architecture, each operating at a different resolution to capture high-level features, in addition to maintaining low-level details and textures under mixed lighting conditions. The proposed methodology computes the loss at multiple scales, balancing reconstruction accuracy and perceptual quality to enhance overall image generation. The distinct blend of the loss calculation at each level of the pyramid, combined with the architecture of the Laplacian pyramid enables LapLoss to exceed contemporary contrast enhancement techniques. This framework achieves state-of-the-art results, consistently performing well across different lighting conditions in the SICE dataset.

Title: Physics-Informed Generative Approaches for Wireless Channel Modeling
Authors: Satyavrat Wagle, Akshay Malhotra, Shahab Hamidi-Rad, Aditya Sant, Christopher G. Brinton, David J. Love
Abstract: In recent years, machine learning (ML) methods have become increasingly popular in wireless communication systems for several applications. A critical bottleneck for designing ML systems for wireless communications is the availability of realistic wireless channel datasets, which are extremely resource intensive to produce. To this end, the generation of realistic wireless channels plays a key role in the subsequent design of effective ML algorithms for wireless communication systems. Generative models have been proposed to synthesize channel matrices, but outputs produced by such methods may not correspond to geometrically viable channels and do not provide any insight into the scenario of interest. In this work, we aim to address both these issues by integrating a parametric, physics-based geometric channel (PBGC) modeling framework with generative methods. To address limitations with gradient flow through the PBGC model, a linearized reformulation is presented, which ensures smooth gradient flow during generative model training, while also capturing insights about the underlying physical environment. We evaluate our model against prior baselines by comparing the generated samples in terms of the 2-Wasserstein distance and through the utility of generated data when used for downstream compression tasks.

Title: HealthiVert-GAN: A Novel Framework of Pseudo-Healthy Vertebral Image Synthesis for Interpretable Compression Fracture Grading
Authors: Qi Zhang, Shunan Zhang, Ziqi Zhao, Kun Wang, Jun Xu, Jianqi Sun
Abstract: Osteoporotic vertebral compression fractures (VCFs) are prevalent in the elderly population, typically assessed on computed tomography (CT) scans by evaluating vertebral height loss. This assessment helps determine the fracture's impact on spinal stability and the need for surgical intervention. However, clinical data indicate that many VCFs exhibit irregular compression, complicating accurate diagnosis. While deep learning methods have shown promise in aiding VCFs screening, they often lack interpretability and sufficient sensitivity, limiting their clinical applicability. To address these challenges, we introduce a novel vertebra synthesis-height loss quantification-VCFs grading framework. Our proposed model, HealthiVert-GAN, utilizes a coarse-to-fine synthesis network designed to generate pseudo-healthy vertebral images that simulate the pre-fracture state of fractured vertebrae. This model integrates three auxiliary modules that leverage the morphology and height information of adjacent healthy vertebrae to ensure anatomical consistency. Additionally, we introduce the Relative Height Loss of Vertebrae (RHLV) as a quantification metric, which divides each vertebra into three sections to measure height loss between pre-fracture and post-fracture states, followed by fracture severity classification using a Support Vector Machine (SVM). Our approach achieves state-of-the-art classification performance on both the Verse2019 dataset and our private dataset, and it provides cross-sectional distribution maps of vertebral height loss. This practical tool enhances diagnostic sensitivity in clinical settings and assisting in surgical decision-making. Our code is available: this https URL.

Title: GrInAdapt: Scaling Retinal Vessel Structural Map Segmentation Through Grounding, Integrating and Adapting Multi-device, Multi-site, and Multi-modal Fundus Domains
Authors: Zixuan Liu, Aaron Honjaya, Yuekai Xu, Yi Zhang, Hefu Pan, Xin Wang, Linda G Shapiro, Sheng Wang, Ruikang K Wang
Abstract: Retinal vessel segmentation is critical for diagnosing ocular conditions, yet current deep learning methods are limited by modality-specific challenges and significant distribution shifts across imaging devices, resolutions, and anatomical regions. In this paper, we propose GrInAdapt, a novel framework for source-free multi-target domain adaptation that leverages multi-view images to refine segmentation labels and enhance model generalizability for optical coherence tomography angiography (OCTA) of the fundus of the eye. GrInAdapt follows an intuitive three-step approach: (i) grounding images to a common anchor space via registration, (ii) integrating predictions from multiple views to achieve improved label consensus, and (iii) adapting the source model to diverse target domains. Furthermore, GrInAdapt is flexible enough to incorporate auxiliary modalities such as color fundus photography, to provide complementary cues for robust vessel segmentation. Extensive experiments on a multi-device, multi-site, and multi-modal retinal dataset demonstrate that GrInAdapt significantly outperforms existing domain adaptation methods, achieving higher segmentation accuracy and robustness across multiple domains. These results highlight the potential of GrInAdapt to advance automated retinal vessel analysis and support robust clinical decision-making.

Title: A 2-6 GHz Ultra-Wideband CMOS Transceiver for Radar Applications
Authors: Alin Thomas Tharakan, Prince Phillip, Gokulan T, Sumit Kumar, Gaurab Banerjee
Abstract: This paper presents a low power, low cost transceiver architecture to implement radar-on-a-chip. The transceiver comprises of a full ultra-wideband (UWB) transmitter and a full UWB band receiver. A design methodology to maximize the tuning range of the voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) is presented. At the transmitter side, a sub-harmonic mixer is used for signal up-conversion. The receiver low noise amplifier (LNA) has a 2 to 6 GHz input matching bandwidth with a power gain of 9 dB and a noise figure of 2.5 dB. The transceiver is implemented in Cadence EDA tools using 65nm CMOS technology. The system achieves a total dc power consumption of 50 mW. Good noise figure performance; good wide-band matching; gain; high level of integration; low power; low cost of the proposed UWB radar transceiver front-end make it a highly competitive SoC solution for low power UWB transceivers.

Title: Natural Gradient Descent for Control
Authors: Ramin Esmzad, Farnaz Adib Yaghmaie, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper bridges optimization and control, and presents a novel closed-loop control framework based on natural gradient descent, offering a trajectory-oriented alternative to traditional cost-function tuning. By leveraging the Fisher Information Matrix, we formulate a preconditioned gradient descent update that explicitly shapes system trajectories. We show that, in sharp contrast to traditional controllers, our approach provides flexibility to shape the system's low-level behavior. To this end, the proposed method parameterizes closed-loop dynamics in terms of stationary covariance and an unknown cost function, providing a geometric interpretation of control adjustments. We establish theoretical stability conditions. The simulation results on a rotary inverted pendulum benchmark highlight the advantages of natural gradient descent in trajectory shaping.

Title: Gradient-Driven Graph Neural Networks for Learning Digital and Hybrid Precoder
Authors: Lin Zhang, Shengqian Han, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: The optimization of multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoders is a widely recognized challenging problem. Existing work has demonstrated the potential of graph neural networks (GNNs) in learning precoding policies. However, existing GNNs often exhibit poor generalizability for the numbers of users or antennas. In this paper, we develop a gradient-driven GNN design method for the learning of fully digital and hybrid precoding policies. The proposed GNNs leverage two kinds of knowledge, namely the gradient of signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) to the precoders and the permutation equivariant property of the precoding policy. To demonstrate the flexibility of the proposed method for accommodating different optimization objectives and different precoding policies, we first apply the proposed method to learn the fully digital precoding policies. We study two precoder optimization problems for spectral efficiency (SE) maximization and log-SE maximization to achieve proportional fairness. We then apply the proposed method to learn the hybrid precoding policy, where the gradients to analog and digital precoders are exploited for the design of the GNN. Simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed methods for learning different precoding policies and better generalization performance to the numbers of both users and antennas compared to baseline GNNs.

Title: Pathology-Guided AI System for Accurate Segmentation and Diagnosis of Cervical Spondylosis
Authors: Qi Zhang, Xiuyuan Chen, Ziyi He, Lianming Wu, Kun Wang, Jianqi Sun, Hongxing Shen
Abstract: Cervical spondylosis, a complex and prevalent condition, demands precise and efficient diagnostic techniques for accurate assessment. While MRI offers detailed visualization of cervical spine anatomy, manual interpretation remains labor-intensive and prone to error. To address this, we developed an innovative AI-assisted Expert-based Diagnosis System that automates both segmentation and diagnosis of cervical spondylosis using MRI. Leveraging a dataset of 960 cervical MRI images from patients with cervical disc herniation, our system features a pathology-guided segmentation model capable of accurately segmenting key cervical anatomical structures. The segmentation is followed by an expert-based diagnostic framework that automates the calculation of critical clinical indicators. Our segmentation model achieved an impressive average Dice coefficient exceeding 0.90 across four cervical spinal anatomies and demonstrated enhanced accuracy in herniation areas. Diagnostic evaluation further showcased the system precision, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 2.44 degree for the C2-C7 Cobb angle and 3.60 precentage for the Maximum Spinal Cord Compression (MSCC) coefficient. In addition, our method delivered high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores in herniation localization, K-line status assessment, and T2 hyperintensity detection. Comparative analysis demonstrates that our system outperforms existing methods, establishing a new benchmark for segmentation and diagnostic tasks for cervical spondylosis.

Title: RGB-Phase Speckle: Cross-Scene Stereo 3D Reconstruction via Wrapped Pre-Normalization
Authors: Kai Yang, Zijian Bai, Yang Xiao, Xinyu Li, Xiaohan Shi
Abstract: 3D reconstruction garners increasing attention alongside the advancement of high-level image applications, where dense stereo matching (DSM) serves as a pivotal technique. Previous studies often rely on publicly available datasets for training, focusing on modifying network architectures or incorporating specialized modules to extract domain-invariant features and thus improve model robustness. In contrast, inspired by single-frame structured-light phase-shifting encoding, this study introduces RGB-Speckle, a cross-scene 3D reconstruction framework based on an active stereo camera system, designed to enhance robustness. Specifically, we propose a novel phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding method: first, we randomly perturb phase-shift maps and embed them into the three RGB channels to generate color speckle patterns; subsequently, the camera captures phase-encoded images modulated by objects as input to a stereo matching network. This technique effectively mitigates external interference and ensures consistent input data for RGB-Speckle, thereby bolstering cross-domain 3D reconstruction stability. To validate the proposed method, we conduct complex experiments: (1) construct a color speckle dataset for complex scenarios based on the proposed encoding scheme; (2) evaluate the impact of the phase pre-normalization encoding-decoding technique on 3D reconstruction accuracy; and (3) further investigate its robustness across diverse conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed RGB-Speckle model offers significant advantages in cross-domain and cross-scene 3D reconstruction tasks, enhancing model generalization and reinforcing robustness in challenging environments, thus providing a novel solution for robust 3D reconstruction research.

Title: Exploring the usage of Probabilistic Neural Networks for Ionospheric electron density estimation
Authors: Miquel Garcia-Fernandez
Abstract: A fundamental limitation of traditional Neural Networks (NN) in predictive modelling is their inability to quantify uncertainty in their outputs. In critical applications like positioning systems, understanding the reliability of predictions is critical for constructing confidence intervals, early warning systems, and effectively propagating results. For instance, Precise Point Positioning in satellite navigation heavily relies on accurate error models for ancillary data (orbits, clocks, ionosphere, and troposphere) to compute precise error estimates. In addition, these uncertainty estimates are needed to establish robust protection levels in safety critical applications. To address this challenge, the main objectives of this paper aims at exploring a potential framework capable of providing both point estimates and associated uncertainty measures of ionospheric Vertical Total Electron Content (VTEC). In this context, Probabilistic Neural Networks (PNNs) offer a promising approach to achieve this goal. However, constructing an effective PNN requires meticulous design of hidden and output layers, as well as careful definition of prior and posterior probability distributions for network weights and biases. A key finding of this study is that the uncertainty provided by the PNN model in VTEC estimates may be systematically underestimated. In low-latitude areas, the actual error was observed to be as much as twice the model's estimate. This underestimation is expected to be more pronounced during solar maximum, correlating with increased VTEC values.

Title: Momentum-based Distributed Resource Scheduling Optimization Subject to Sector-Bound Nonlinearity and Latency
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Zulfiya R. Gabidullina, Hamid R. Rabiee
Abstract: This paper proposes an accelerated consensus-based distributed iterative algorithm for resource allocation and scheduling. The proposed gradient-tracking algorithm introduces an auxiliary variable to add momentum towards the optimal state. We prove that this solution is all-time feasible, implying that the coupling constraint always holds along the algorithm iterative procedure; therefore, the algorithm can be terminated at any time. This is in contrast to the ADMM-based solutions that meet constraint feasibility asymptotically. Further, we show that the proposed algorithm can handle possible link nonlinearity due to logarithmically-quantized data transmission (or any sign-preserving odd sector-bound nonlinear mapping). We prove convergence over uniformly-connected dynamic networks (i.e., a hybrid setup) that may occur in mobile and time-varying multi-agent networks. Further, the latency issue over the network is addressed by proposing delay-tolerant solutions. To our best knowledge, accelerated momentum-based convergence, nonlinear linking, all-time feasibility, uniform network connectivity, and handling (possible) time delays are not altogether addressed in the literature. These contributions make our solution practical in many real-world applications.

Title: Attention on the Wires (AttWire): A Foundation Model for Detecting Devices and Catheters in X-ray Fluoroscopic Images
Authors: YingLiang Ma, Sandra Howell, Aldo Rinaldi, Tarv Dhanjal, Kawal S. Rhode
Abstract: Objective: Interventional devices, catheters and insertable imaging devices such as transesophageal echo (TOE) probes are routinely used in minimally invasive cardiovascular procedures. Detecting their positions and orientations in X-ray fluoroscopic images is important for many clinical applications. Method: In this paper, a novel attention mechanism was designed to guide a convolution neural network (CNN) model to the areas of wires in X-ray images, as nearly all interventional devices and catheters used in cardiovascular procedures contain wires. The attention mechanism includes multi-scale Gaussian derivative filters and a dot-product-based attention layer. By utilizing the proposed attention mechanism, a lightweight foundation model can be created to detect multiple objects simultaneously with higher precision and real-time speed. Results: The proposed model was trained and tested on a total of 12,438 X-ray images. An accuracy of 0.88 was achieved for detecting an echo probe and 0.87 for detecting an artificial valve at 58 FPS. The accuracy was measured by intersection-over-union (IoU). We also achieved a 99.8% success rate in detecting a 10-electrode catheter and a 97.8% success rate in detecting an ablation catheter. Conclusion: Our detection foundation model can simultaneously detect and identify both interventional devices and flexible catheters in real-time X-ray fluoroscopic images. Significance: The proposed model employs a novel attention mechanism to achieve high-performance object detection, making it suitable for various clinical applications and robotic-assisted surgeries.

Title: A Novel Distributed PV Power Forecasting Approach Based on Time-LLM
Authors: Huapeng Lin, Miao Yu
Abstract: Distributed photovoltaic (DPV) systems are essential for advancing renewable energy applications and achieving energy independence. Accurate DPV power forecasting can optimize power system planning and scheduling while significantly reducing energy loss, thus enhancing overall system efficiency and reliability. However, solar energy's intermittent nature and DPV systems' spatial distribution create significant forecasting challenges. Traditional methods often rely on costly external data, such as numerical weather prediction (NWP) and satellite images, which are difficult to scale for smaller DPV systems. To tackle this issue, this study has introduced an advanced large language model (LLM)-based time series forecasting framework Time-LLM to improve the DPV power forecasting accuracy and generalization ability. By reprogramming, the framework aligns historical power data with natural language modalities, facilitating efficient modeling of time-series data. Then Qwen2.5-3B model is integrated as the backbone LLM to process input data by leveraging its pattern recognition and inference abilities, achieving a balance between efficiency and performance. Finally, by using a flatten and linear projection layer, the LLM's high-dimensional output is transformed into the final forecasts. Experimental results indicate that Time-LLM outperforms leading recent advanced time series forecasting models, such as Transformer-based methods and MLP-based models, achieving superior accuracy in both short-term and long-term forecasting. Time-LLM also demonstrates exceptional adaptability in few-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. To the best of the authors' knowledge, this study is the first attempt to explore the application of LLMs to DPV power forecasting, which can offer a scalable solution that eliminates reliance on costly external data sources and improve real-world forecasting accuracy.

Title: Optimal Output Feedback Learning Control for Discrete-Time Linear Quadratic Regulation
Authors: Kedi Xiea, Martin Guay, Shimin Wang, Fang Deng, Maobin Lu
Abstract: This paper studies the linear quadratic regulation (LQR) problem of unknown discrete-time systems via dynamic output feedback learning control. In contrast to the state feedback, the optimality of the dynamic output feedback control for solving the LQR problem requires an implicit condition on the convergence of the state observer. Moreover, due to unknown system matrices and the existence of observer error, it is difficult to analyze the convergence and stability of most existing output feedback learning-based control methods. To tackle these issues, we propose a generalized dynamic output feedback learning control approach with guaranteed convergence, stability, and optimality performance for solving the LQR problem of unknown discrete-time linear systems. In particular, a dynamic output feedback controller is designed to be equivalent to a state feedback controller. This equivalence relationship is an inherent property without requiring convergence of the estimated state by the state observer, which plays a key role in establishing the off-policy learning control approaches. By value iteration and policy iteration schemes, the adaptive dynamic programming based learning control approaches are developed to estimate the optimal feedback control gain. In addition, a model-free stability criterion is provided by finding a nonsingular parameterization matrix, which contributes to establishing a switched iteration scheme. Furthermore, the convergence, stability, and optimality analyses of the proposed output feedback learning control approaches are given. Finally, the theoretical results are validated by two numerical examples.

Title: Dense or Sparse? Post-Packing Interconnection Analysis in FPGAs
Authors: X. Wang, D. Stroobandt
Abstract: Packing is a crucial step of FPGA design, directly impacting interconnect complexity, routing congestion, and overall performance. This paper presents a post-packing interconnect-aware analysis, illustrating how dense (sparse) packing changes the interconnection structure. We introduce a new metric, RDensity, to define post-packing density and investigate its influence on routability. Through a comparative study of two packing tools, we demonstrate that density directly impacts routability. Our findings provide valuable insights into how packing decisions affect FPGA efficiency and offer guidance for improving FPGA packing tools and architecture design by integrating interconnect-aware methods. The goal is to achieve efficient routing while maintaining an optimal balance between cluster density, CLB pin counts, and logical block sizes.

Title: Optimization of An Induced Magnetic Field-Based Positioning System
Authors: Sizhen Bian, Gerald Pirkl, Jingyuan Cheng, Paul Lukowicz
Abstract: Using oscillating magnetic fields for indoor positioning is a robust way to resist dynamic environments. This work presents the hard- and software-related optimizations of an induced magnetic field positioning system. We describe a new coil architecture for both the transmitter and receiver, reducing inter-axes cross-talk. A new analog circuit design on the receiver side attains an acceptable noise level and increases the detection range from 4m to 8m (the covered area is increased from $50m^2$ to $200m^2$). The median positioning error is reduced from 0.56~m to 0.25m in the near field with fingerprinting methods. Experiments in office and factory areas (including robotic and industrial equipment) demonstrate the system's robustness in large areas. This work aims to enlighten researchers working on the same topic with constructive optimization directions on their own induced magnetic field-based systems.

Title: Hybrid CNN-Dilated Self-attention Model Using Inertial and Body-Area Electrostatic Sensing for Gym Workout Recognition, Counting, and User Authentification
Authors: Sizhen Bian, Vitor Fortes Rey, Siyu Yuan, Paul Lukowicz
Abstract: While human body capacitance ($HBC$) has been explored as a novel wearable motion sensing modality, its competence has never been quantitatively demonstrated compared to that of the dominant inertial measurement unit ($IMU$) in practical scenarios. This work is thus motivated to evaluate the contribution of $HBC$ in wearable motion sensing. A real-life case study, gym workout tracking, is described to assess the effectiveness of $HBC$ as a complement to $IMU$ in activity recognition. Fifty gym sessions from ten volunteers were collected, bringing a fifty-hour annotated $IMU$ and $HBC$ dataset. With a hybrid CNN-Dilated neural network model empowered with the self-attention mechanism, $HBC$ slightly improves accuracy to the $IMU$ for workout recognition and has substantial advantages over $IMU$ for repetition counting. This work helps to enhance the understanding of $HBC$, a novel wearable motion-sensing modality based on the body-area electrostatic field. All materials presented in this work are open-sourced to promote further study \footnote{this https URL}.

Title: Enhanced Pediatric Dental Segmentation Using a Custom SegUNet with VGG19 Backbone on Panoramic Radiographs
Authors: Md Ohiduzzaman Ovi, Maliha Sanjana, Fahad Fahad, Mahjabin Runa, Zarin Tasnim Rothy, Tanmoy Sarkar Pias, A.M. Tayeful Islam, Rumman Ahmed Prodhan
Abstract: Pediatric dental segmentation is critical in dental diagnostics, presenting unique challenges due to variations in dental structures and the lower number of pediatric X-ray images. This study proposes a custom SegUNet model with a VGG19 backbone, designed explicitly for pediatric dental segmentation and applied to the Children's Dental Panoramic Radiographs dataset. The SegUNet architecture with a VGG19 backbone has been employed on this dataset for the first time, achieving state-of-the-art performance. The model reached an accuracy of 97.53%, a dice coefficient of 92.49%, and an intersection over union (IOU) of 91.46%, setting a new benchmark for this dataset. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the VGG19 backbone in enhancing feature extraction and improving segmentation precision. Comprehensive evaluations across metrics, including precision, recall, and specificity, indicate the robustness of this approach. The model's ability to generalize across diverse dental structures makes it a valuable tool for clinical applications in pediatric dental care. It offers a reliable and efficient solution for automated dental diagnostics.

Title: Dynamic Load Balancing for EV Charging Stations Using Reinforcement Learning and Demand Prediction
Authors: Hesam Mosalli, Saba Sanami, Yu Yang, Hen-Geul Yeh, Amir G. Aghdam
Abstract: This paper presents a method for load balancing and dynamic pricing in electric vehicle (EV) charging networks, utilizing reinforcement learning (RL) to enhance network performance. The proposed framework integrates a pre-trained graph neural network to predict demand elasticity and inform pricing decisions. The spatio-temporal EV charging demand prediction (EVCDP) dataset from Shenzhen is utilized to capture the geographic and temporal characteristics of the charging stations. The RL model dynamically adjusts prices at individual stations based on occupancy, maximum station capacity, and demand forecasts, ensuring an equitable network load distribution while preventing station overloads. By leveraging spatially-aware demand predictions and a carefully designed reward function, the framework achieves efficient load balancing and adaptive pricing strategies that respond to localized demand and global network dynamics, ensuring improved network stability and user satisfaction. The efficacy of the approach is validated through simulations on the dataset, showing significant improvements in load balancing and reduced overload as the RL agent iteratively interacts with the environment and learns to dynamically adjust pricing strategies based on real-time demand patterns and station constraints. The findings highlight the potential of adaptive pricing and load-balancing strategies to address the complexities of EV infrastructure, paving the way for scalable and user-centric solutions.

Title: ProSE: Diffusion Priors for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Sonal Kumar, Sreyan Ghosh, Utkarsh Tyagi, Anton Jeran Ratnarajah, Chandra Kiran Reddy Evuru, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha
Abstract: Speech enhancement (SE) is the foundational task of enhancing the clarity and quality of speech in the presence of non-stationary additive noise. While deterministic deep learning models have been commonly employed for SE, recent research indicates that generative models, such as denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have shown promise. However, unlike speech generation, SE has a strong constraint in generating results in accordance with the underlying ground-truth signal. Additionally, for a wide variety of applications, SE systems need to be employed in real-time, and traditional diffusion models (DMs) requiring many iterations of a large model during inference are inefficient. To address these issues, we propose ProSE (diffusion-based Priors for SE), a novel methodology based on an alternative framework for applying diffusion models to SE. Specifically, we first apply DDPMs to generate priors in a latent space due to their powerful distribution mapping capabilities. The priors are then integrated into a transformer-based regression model for SE. The priors guide the regression model in the enhancement process. Since the diffusion process is applied to a compact latent space, the diffusion model takes fewer iterations than the traditional DM to obtain accurate estimations. Additionally, using a regression model for SE avoids the distortion issue caused by misaligned details generated by DMs. Our experiments show that ProSE achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with fewer computational costs.

Title: Experimental Demonstration of Over the Air Federated Learning for Cellular Networks
Authors: Suyash Pradhan, Asil Koc, Kubra Alemdar, Mohamed Amine Arfaoui, Philip Pietraski, Francois Periard, Guodong Zhang, Mario Hudon, Kaushik Chowdhury
Abstract: Over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) offers an exciting new direction over classical FL by averaging model weights using the physics of analog signal propagation. Since each participant broadcasts its model weights concurrently in time and frequency, this paradigm conserves communication bandwidth and model upload latency. Despite its potential, there is no prior large-scale demonstration on a real-world experimental platform. This paper proves for the first time that OTA-FL can be deployed in a cellular network setting within the constraints of a 5G compliant waveform. To achieve this, we identify challenges caused by multi-path fading effects, thermal noise at the radio devices, and maintaining highly precise synchronization across multiple clients to perform coherent OTA combining. To address these challenges, we propose a unified framework for real-time channel estimation, model weight to OFDM symbol mapping and dual-layer synchronization interface to perform OTA model training. We experimentally validate OTA-FL using two relevant applications - Channel Estimation and Object Classification, at a large-scale on ORBIT Testbed and a portable setup respectively, along with analyzing the benefits from the perspective of a telecom operator. Under specific experimental conditions, OTA-FL achieves equivalent model performance, supplemented with 43 times improvement in spectrum utilization and 7 times improvement in energy efficiency over classical FL when considering 5 nodes.

Title: X-LRM: X-ray Large Reconstruction Model for Extremely Sparse-View Computed Tomography Recovery in One Second
Authors: Guofeng Zhang, Ruyi Zha, Hao He, Yixun Liang, Alan Yuille, Hongdong Li, Yuanhao Cai
Abstract: Sparse-view 3D CT reconstruction aims to recover volumetric structures from a limited number of 2D X-ray projections. Existing feedforward methods are constrained by the limited capacity of CNN-based architectures and the scarcity of large-scale training datasets. In this paper, we propose an X-ray Large Reconstruction Model (X-LRM) for extremely sparse-view (<10 views) CT reconstruction. X-LRM consists of two key components: X-former and X-triplane. Our X-former can handle an arbitrary number of input views using an MLP-based image tokenizer and a Transformer-based encoder. The output tokens are then upsampled into our X-triplane representation, which models the 3D radiodensity as an implicit neural field. To support the training of X-LRM, we introduce Torso-16K, a large-scale dataset comprising over 16K volume-projection pairs of various torso organs. Extensive experiments demonstrate that X-LRM outperforms the state-of-the-art method by 1.5 dB and achieves 27x faster speed and better flexibility. Furthermore, the downstream evaluation of lung segmentation tasks also suggests the practical value of our approach. Our code, pre-trained models, and dataset will be released at this https URL

Title: Pulse Processing -- Overview and Challenges
Authors: Jonathan H. Manton
Abstract: The detection of irregularly spaced pulses of non-negligible width is a fascinating yet under-explored topic in signal processing. It sits adjacent to other core topics such as radar and symbol detection yet has its own distinctive challenges. Even modern techniques such as compressed sensing perform worse than may be expected on pulse processing problems. Real-world applications include nuclear spectroscopy, flow cytometry, seismic signal processing and neural spike sorting, and these in turn have applications to environmental radiation monitoring, surveying, diagnostic medicine, industrial imaging, biomedical imaging, top-down proteomics, and security screening, to name just a few. This overview paper endeavours to position the pulse processing problem in the context of signal processing. It also describes some current challenges in the field.

Title: Decoding the Black Box: Integrating Moral Imagination with Technical AI Governance
Authors: Krti Tallam
Abstract: This paper examines the intricate interplay among AI safety, security, and governance by integrating technical systems engineering with principles of moral imagination and ethical philosophy. Drawing on foundational insights from Weapons of Math Destruction and Thinking in Systems alongside contemporary debates in AI ethics, we develop a comprehensive multi-dimensional framework designed to regulate AI technologies deployed in high-stakes domains such as defense, finance, healthcare, and education. Our approach combines rigorous technical analysis, quantitative risk assessment, and normative evaluation to expose systemic vulnerabilities inherent in opaque, black-box models. Detailed case studies, including analyses of Microsoft Tay (2016) and the UK A-Level Grading Algorithm (2020), demonstrate how security lapses, bias amplification, and lack of accountability can precipitate cascading failures that undermine public trust. We conclude by outlining targeted strategies for enhancing AI resilience through adaptive regulatory mechanisms, robust security protocols, and interdisciplinary oversight, thereby advancing the state of the art in ethical and technical AI governance.

Title: UAV-Assisted Coverage Hole Detection Using Reinforcement Learning in Urban Cellular Networks
Authors: Mushfiqur Rahman, Ismail Guvenc, David Ramirez, Chau-Wai Wong
Abstract: Deployment of cellular networks in urban areas requires addressing various challenges. For example, high-rise buildings with varying geometrical shapes and heights contribute to signal attenuation, reflection, diffraction, and scattering effects. This creates a high possibility of coverage holes (CHs) within the proximity of the buildings. Detecting these CHs is critical for network operators to ensure quality of service, as customers in such areas experience weak or no signal reception. To address this challenge, we propose an approach using an autonomous vehicle, such as an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), to detect CHs, for minimizing drive test efforts and reducing human labor. The UAV leverages reinforcement learning (RL) to find CHs using stored local building maps, its current location, and measured signal strengths. As the UAV moves, it dynamically updates its knowledge of the signal environment and its direction to a nearby CH while avoiding collisions with buildings. We created a wide range of testing scenarios using building maps from OpenStreetMap and signal strength data generated by NVIDIA Sionna raytracing simulations. The results demonstrate that the RL-based approach performs better than non-machine learning, geometry-based methods in detecting CHs in urban areas. Additionally, even with a limited number of UAV measurements, the method achieves performance close to theoretical upper bounds that assume complete knowledge of all signal strengths.

Title: Teager Energy Operator as a Metric to Evaluate Local Synchronization of Power System Devices
Authors: Bruno Pinheiro, Ignacio Ponce, Daniel Dotta, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel formulation to evaluate the local synchronization of power system devices, namely Synchronization Energy (SE). The formulation is derived based on the complex frequency concept and the Teager Energy Operator applied to the complex power. This formulation offers valuable insights into the relationship between complex frequency of voltage and current of the device and its stationary operating. Based on this relationship we derive the conditions for a novel definition of local synchronization of power system devices. Through various case studies, the paper demonstrates how SE can effectively assess local synchronization under diverse operating conditions.

Title: LSA: Latent Style Augmentation Towards Stain-Agnostic Cervical Cancer Screening
Authors: Jiangdong Cai, Haotian Jiang, Zhenrong Shen, Yonghao Li, Honglin Xiong, Lichi Zhang, Qian Wang
Abstract: The deployment of computer-aided diagnosis systems for cervical cancer screening using whole slide images (WSIs) faces critical challenges due to domain shifts caused by staining variations across different scanners and imaging environments. While existing stain augmentation methods improve patch-level robustness, they fail to scale to WSIs due to two key limitations: (1) inconsistent stain patterns when extending patch operations to gigapixel slides, and (2) prohibitive computational/storage costs from offline processing of augmented this http URL address this, we propose Latent Style Augmentation (LSA), a framework that performs efficient, online stain augmentation directly on WSI-level latent features. We first introduce WSAug, a WSI-level stain augmentation method ensuring consistent stain across patches within a WSI. Using offline-augmented WSIs by WSAug, we design and train Stain Transformer, which can simulate targeted style in the latent space, efficiently enhancing the robustness of the WSI-level classifier. We validate our method on a multi-scanner WSI dataset for cervical cancer diagnosis. Despite being trained on data from a single scanner, our approach achieves significant performance improvements on out-of-distribution data from other scanners. Code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Intelligent Control of Merging Car-following and Lane-Changing Behavior
Authors: Farzam Tajdari, Amin Rezasoltani
Abstract: Recent research has paid little attention to complex driving behaviors, namely merging car-following and lane-changing behavior, and how lane-changing affects algorithms designed to model and control a car-following vehicle. During the merging behavior, the Follower Vehicle (FV) might significantly diverge from typical car-following models. Thus, this paper aims to control the FV witnessing lane-changing behavior based on anticipation, perception, preparation, and relaxation states defined by a novel measurable human perception index. Data from human drivers are utilized to create a perception-based fuzzy controller for the behavior vehicle's route guidance, taking into account the opacity of human driving judgments. We illustrate the efficacy of the established technique using simulated trials and data from actual drivers, focusing on the benefits of the increased comfort, safety, and uniformity of traffic flow and the decreased of wait time and motion sickness this brings about.

Title: Performance Analysis of Multi-IRS Aided Multiple Operator Systems at mmWave Frequencies
Authors: Souradeep Ghosh, L. Yashvanth, Chandra R. Murthy
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) are envisioned to enhance the performance of mmWave wireless systems. In practice, multiple mobile operators (MO) coexist in an area and provide simultaneous and independent services to user-equipments (UEs) on different frequency bands. Then, if each MO deploys an IRS to enhance its performance, the IRSs also alter the channels of UEs of other MOs. In this context, this paper addresses the following questions: can an MO still continue to control its IRS independently of other MOs and IRSs? Is joint optimization of IRSs deployed by different MOs and inter-MO cooperation needed? To that end, by considering the mmWave bands, we first derive the ergodic sum spectral efficiency (SE) in a $2$-MO system for the following schemes: 1) joint optimization of an overall phase angle of the IRSs with MO cooperation, 2) MO cooperation via time-sharing, and 3) no cooperation between the MOs. We find that even with no cooperation between the MOs, the performance of a given MO is not degraded by the presence of an out-of-band (OOB) MO deploying and independently controlling its own IRS. On the other hand, the SE gain obtained at a given MO using joint optimization and cooperation over the no-cooperation scheme decreases inversely with the number of elements in the IRS deployed by the other MO. We generalize our results to a multiple MO setup and show that the gain in the sum-SE over the no-cooperation case increases at least linearly with the number of OOB MOs. Finally, we numerically verify our findings and conclude that every MO can independently operate and tune its IRS; cooperation via optimizing an overall phase only brings marginal benefits in practice.

Title: Why Pre-trained Models Fail: Feature Entanglement in Multi-modal Depression Detection
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps
Abstract: Depression remains a pressing global mental health issue, driving considerable research into AI-driven detection approaches. While pre-trained models, particularly speech self-supervised models (SSL Models), have been applied to depression detection, they show unexpectedly poor performance without extensive data augmentation. Large Language Models (LLMs), despite their success across various domains, have not been explored in multi-modal depression detection. In this paper, we first establish an LLM-based system to investigate its potential in this task, uncovering fundamental limitations in handling multi-modal information. Through systematic analysis, we discover that the poor performance of pre-trained models stems from the conflation of high-level information, where high-level features derived from both content and speech are mixed within pre-trained models model representations, making it challenging to establish effective decision boundaries. To address this, we propose an information separation framework that disentangles these features, significantly improving the performance of both SSL models and LLMs in depression detection. Our experiments validate this finding and demonstrate that the integration of separated features yields substantial improvements over existing approaches, providing new insights for developing more effective multi-modal depression detection systems.

Title: Learning of Uplink Resource Allocation with Multiuser QoS Constraints
Authors: Manru Yin, Shengqian Han, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: In the paper the joint optimization of uplink multiuser power and resource block (RB) allocation are studied, where each user has quality of service (QoS) constraints on both long- and short-blocklength transmissions. The objective is to minimize the consumption of RBs for meeting the QoS requirements, leading to a mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem. We resort to deep learning to solve the problem with low inference complexity. To provide a performance benchmark for learning based methods, we propose a hierarchical algorithm to find the global optimal solution in the single-user scenario, which is then extended to the multiuser scenario. The design of the learning method, however, is challenging due to the discrete policy to be learned, which results in either vanishing or exploding gradient during neural network training. We introduce two types of smoothing functions to approximate the involved discretizing processes and propose a smoothing parameter adaption method. Another critical challenge lies in guaranteeing the QoS constraints. To address it, we design a nonlinear function to intensify the penalties for minor constraint violations. Simulation results demonstrate the advantages of the proposed method in reducing the number of occupied RBs and satisfying QoS constraints reliably.

Title: ImplicitCell: Resolution Cell Modeling of Joint Implicit Volume Reconstruction and Pose Refinement in Freehand 3D Ultrasound
Authors: Sheng Song, Yiting Chen, Duo Xu, Songhan Ge, Yunqian Huang, Junni Shi, Man Chen, Hongbo Chen, Rui Zheng
Abstract: Freehand 3D ultrasound enables volumetric imaging by tracking a conventional ultrasound probe during freehand scanning, offering enriched spatial information that improves clinical diagnosis. However, the quality of reconstructed volumes is often compromised by tracking system noise and irregular probe movements, leading to artifacts in the final reconstruction. To address these challenges, we propose ImplicitCell, a novel framework that integrates Implicit Neural Representation (INR) with an ultrasound resolution cell model for joint optimization of volume reconstruction and pose refinement. Three distinct datasets are used for comprehensive validation, including phantom, common carotid artery, and carotid atherosclerosis. Experimental results demonstrate that ImplicitCell significantly reduces reconstruction artifacts and improves volume quality compared to existing methods, particularly in challenging scenarios with noisy tracking data. These improvements enhance the clinical utility of freehand 3D ultrasound by providing more reliable and precise diagnostic information.

Title: Diffusion Model Based Probabilistic Day-ahead Load Forecasting
Authors: Ding Lin, Han Guo, Jianhui Wang
Abstract: Accurate probabilistic load forecasting is crucial for maintaining the safety and stability of power systems. However, the mainstream approach, multi-step prediction, must be improved by cumulative errors and latency issues, which limits its effectiveness in probabilistic day-ahead load forecasting (PDALF). To overcome these challenges, we introduce DALNet, a novel denoising diffusion model designed to generate load curves rather than relying on direct prediction. By shifting the focus to curve generation, DALNet captures the complex distribution of actual load time-series data under specific conditions with greater fidelity. To further enhance DALNet, we propose the temporal multi-scale attention block (TMSAB), a mechanism designed to integrate both positional and temporal information for improved forecasting precision. Furthermore, we utilize kernel density estimation (KDE) to reconstruct the distribution of generated load curves and employ KL divergence to compare them with the actual data distribution. Experimental results demonstrate that DALNet excels in load forecasting accuracy and offers a novel perspective for other predictive tasks within power systems.

Title: Precise Insulin Delivery for Artificial Pancreas: A Reinforcement Learning Optimized Adaptive Fuzzy Control Approach
Authors: Omar Mameche, Abdelhadi Abedou, Taqwa Mezaache, Mohamed Tadjine
Abstract: This paper explores the application of reinforcement learning to optimize the parameters of a Type-1 Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller, designed to operate as an artificial pancreas for Type 1 diabetes. The primary challenge in diabetes management is the dynamic nature of blood glucose levels, which are influenced by several factors such as meal intake and timing. Traditional controllers often struggle to adapt to these changes, leading to suboptimal insulin administration. To address this issue, we employ a reinforcement learning agent tasked with adjusting 27 parameters of the Takagi-Sugeno fuzzy controller at each time step, ensuring real-time adaptability. The study's findings demonstrate that this approach significantly enhances the robustness of the controller against variations in meal size and timing, while also stabilizing glucose levels with minimal exogenous insulin. This adaptive method holds promise for improving the quality of life and health outcomes for individuals with Type 1 diabetes by providing a more responsive and precise management tool. Simulation results are given to highlight the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: Intelligent Spectrum Sharing in Integrated TN-NTNs: A Hierarchical Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Muhammad Umer, Muhammad Ahmed Mohsin, Ali Arshad Nasir, Hatem Abou-Zeid, Syed ALi Hassan
Abstract: Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with terrestrial networks (TNs) is key to enhancing coverage, capacity, and reliability in future wireless communications. However, the multi-tier, heterogeneous architecture of these integrated TN-NTNs introduces complex challenges in spectrum sharing and interference management. Conventional optimization approaches struggle to handle the high-dimensional decision space and dynamic nature of these networks. This paper proposes a novel hierarchical deep reinforcement learning (HDRL) framework to address these challenges and enable intelligent spectrum sharing. The proposed framework leverages the inherent hierarchy of the network, with separate policies for each tier, to learn and optimize spectrum allocation decisions at different timescales and levels of abstraction. By decomposing the complex spectrum sharing problem into manageable sub-tasks and allowing for efficient coordination among the tiers, the HDRL approach offers a scalable and adaptive solution for spectrum management in future TN-NTNs. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework compared to traditional approaches, highlighting its potential to enhance spectral efficiency and network capacity in dynamic, multi-tier environments.

Title: A Novel Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning Algorithm for Pursuit-Evasion Game
Authors: Penglin Hu, Chunhui Zhao, Quan Pan
Abstract: In practical application, the pursuit-evasion game (PEG) often involves multiple complex and conflicting objectives. The single-objective reinforcement learning (RL) usually focuses on a single optimization objective, and it is difficult to find the optimal balance among multiple objectives. This paper proposes a three-objective RL algorithm based on fuzzy Q-learning (FQL) to solve the PEG with different optimization objectives. First, the multi-objective FQL algorithm is introduced, which uses the reward function to represent three optimization objectives: evading pursuit, reaching target, and avoiding obstacle. Second, a multi-objective evaluation method and action selection strategy based on three-dimensional hypervolume are designed, which solved the dilemma of exploration-exploitation. By sampling the Pareto front, the update rule of the global strategy is obtained. The proposed algorithm reduces computational load while ensuring exploration ability. Finally, the performance of the algorithm is verified by simulation results.

Title: X-GAN: A Generative AI-Powered Unsupervised Model for High-Precision Segmentation of Retinal Main Vessels toward Early Detection of Glaucoma
Authors: Cheng Huang, Weizheng Xie, Tsengdar J. Lee, Jui-Kai Wang, Karanjit Kooner, Jia Zhang
Abstract: Structural changes in main retinal blood vessels serve as critical biomarkers for the onset and progression of glaucoma. Identifying these vessels is vital for vascular modeling yet highly challenging. This paper proposes X-GAN, a generative AI-powered unsupervised segmentation model designed for extracting main blood vessels from Optical Coherence Tomography Angiography (OCTA) images. The process begins with the Space Colonization Algorithm (SCA) to rapidly generate a skeleton of vessels, featuring their radii. By synergistically integrating generative adversarial networks (GANs) with biostatistical modeling of vessel radii, X-GAN enables a fast reconstruction of both 2D and 3D representations of the vessels. Based on this reconstruction, X-GAN achieves nearly 100\% segmentation accuracy without relying on labeled data or high-performance computing resources. Also, to address the Issue, data scarity, we introduce GSS-RetVein, a high-definition mixed 2D and 3D glaucoma retinal dataset. GSS-RetVein provides a rigorous benchmark due to its exceptionally clear capillary structures, introducing controlled noise for testing model robustness. Its 2D images feature sharp capillary boundaries, while its 3D component enhances vascular reconstruction and blood flow prediction, supporting glaucoma progression simulations. Experimental results confirm GSS-RetVein's superiority in evaluating main vessel segmentation compared to existing datasets. Code and dataset are here: this https URL.

Title: Transfer Learning for LQR Control
Authors: Taosha Guo, Fabio Pasqualetti
Abstract: In this paper, we study a transfer learning framework for Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) control, where (i) the dynamics of the system of interest (target system) are unknown and only a short trajectory of impulse responses from the target system is provided, and (ii) impulse responses are available from $N$ source systems with different dynamics. We show that the LQR controller can be learned from a sufficiently long trajectory of impulse responses. Further, a transferable mode set can be identified using the available data from source systems and the target system, enabling the reconstruction of the target system's impulse responses for controller design. By leveraging data from the source systems we demonstrate that only n+1 (n being the system dimension) samples of data from the target system are needed to learn the LQR controller, this yields a significant reduction of the required data.

Title: Sphere Precoding for Robust Near-Field Communications
Authors: Hao Luo, Yu Zhang, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: Near-field communication with large antenna arrays promises significant beamforming and multiplexing gains. These communication links, however, are very sensitive to user mobility as any small change in the user position may suddenly drop the signal power. This leads to critical challenges for the robustness of these near-field communication systems. In this paper, we propose \textit{sphere precoding}, which is a robust precoding design to address user mobility in near-field communications. To gain insights into the spatial correlation of near-field channels, we extend the one-ring channel model to what we call one-sphere channel model and derive the channel covariance considering user mobility. Based on the one-sphere channel model, a robust precoding design problem is defined to optimize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) satisfaction probability among mobile users. By utilizing the eigen structure of channel covariance, we further design a relaxed convex problem to approximate the solution of the original non-convex problem. The low-complexity solution effectively shapes a sphere that maintains the signal power for the target user and also nulls its interference within spheres around the other users. Simulation results highlight the efficacy of the proposed solution in achieving robust precoding yet high achievable rates in near-field communication systems.

Title: Cell-Free MIMO-ISAC: Joint Location and Velocity Estimation and Fundamental CRLB Analysis
Authors: Guoqing Xia, Pei Xiao, Qu Luo, Bing Ji, Yue Zhang, Huiyu Zhou
Abstract: This paper investigates joint location and velocity estimation, along with their fundamental performance bounds analysis, in a cell-free multi-input multi-output (MIMO) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system. First, unlike existing studies that derive likelihood functions for target parameter estimation using continuous received signals, we formulate the maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) for radar sensing based on discrete received signals at a given sampling rate. Second, leveraging the proposed MLEs, we derive closed-form Cramer-Rao lower bounds (CRLBs) for joint location and velocity estimation in both single-target and multiple-target scenarios. Third, to enhance computational efficiency, we propose approximate CRLBs and conduct an in-depth accuracy analysis. Additionally, we thoroughly examine the impact of sampling rate, squared effective bandwidth, and time width on CRLB performance. For multiple-target scenarios, the concepts of safety distance and safety velocity are introduced to characterize conditions under which the CRLBs for multiple targets converge to their single target counterparts. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted to verify the accuracy of the proposed CRLBs and the theoretical results using state-of-the-art waveforms, namely orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and orthogonal chirp division multiplexing (OCDM).

Title: Coordinated Ramp Metering Control based on Scalable Nonlinear Traffic Dynamics Model Discovery in a Large Network
Authors: Zihang Wei, Yang Zhou, Yunlong Zhang, Mihir Kulkarni
Abstract: This study proposes a coordinated ramp metering control framework in large networks based on scalable nonlinear traffic dynamics model discovery. Existing coordinated ramp metering control methods often require accurate traffic dynamics models in real time, however, for large-scale highway networks, since these models are always nonlinear, they are extremely challenging to obtain. To overcome this limitation, this study utilizes the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics with Control (SINDYc) to derive the accurate nonlinear traffic dynamics model from observed data. The discovered dynamics model is then integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) coordinated ramp metering controller, enabling optimized control actions that enhance traffic flow and efficiency. The proposed framework is tested on a large-scale highway network that includes three intersecting highways and eight on-ramps, which outperforms the existing approaches, demonstrating its effectiveness and potential for real-time application. This framework can offer a scalable and robust solution for improving real-time traffic management in complex urban environments.

Title: Agile Climate-Sensor Design and Calibration Algorithms Using Machine Learning: Experiments From Cape Point
Authors: Travis Barrett, Amit Kumar Mishra
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the design of an inexpensive and agile climate sensor system which can be repurposed easily to measure various pollutants. We also propose the use of machine learning regression methods to calibrate CO2 data from this cost-effective sensing platform to a reference sensor at the South African Weather Service's Cape Point measurement facility. We show the performance of these methods and found that Random Forest Regression was the best in this scenario. This shows that these machine learning methods can be used to improve the performance of cost-effective sensor platforms and possibly extend the time between manual calibration of sensor networks.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Compressed Sensing for Uplink Grant-Free Access
Authors: Guoqing Xia, Pei Xiao, Bohan Li, Yue Zhang, Huiyu Zhou
Abstract: Compressed sensing (CS)-based techniques have been widely applied in the grant-free non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to a single-antenna base station (BS). In this paper, we consider the multi-antenna reception at the BS for uplink grant-free access for the massive machine type communication (mMTC) with limited channel resources. To enhance the overloading performance of the BS, we develop a general framework for the synergistic amalgamation of the spatial division multiple access (SDMA) technique with the CS-based grant-free NOMA. We derive a closed-form statistical beamforming and a dynamic beamforming scheme for the inter-cluster interference suppression when applying SDMA. Based on this, we further develop a joint adaptive beamforming and subspace pursuit (JABF-SP) algorithm for the multiuser detection and data recovery, with a novel sparsity level decision method without the accurate knowledge of the noise level. To further improve the data recovery performance, we propose an interference cancellation based J-ABF-SP scheme (J-ABF-SP-IC) by using the initial signal estimates generated from the J-ABF-SP algorithm. Illustrative simulations verify the superior user detection and signal recovery performance of our proposed algorithms in comparison with existing CS-based grant-free NOMA techniques.

Title: Multimodal AI-driven Biomarker for Early Detection of Cancer Cachexia
Authors: Sabeen Ahmed, Nathan Parker, Margaret Park, Evan W. Davis, Jennifer B. Permuth, Matthew B. Schabath, Yasin Yilmaz, Ghulam Rasool
Abstract: Cancer cachexia is a multifactorial syndrome characterized by progressive muscle wasting, metabolic dysfunction, and systemic inflammation, leading to reduced quality of life and increased mortality. Despite extensive research, no single definitive biomarker exists, as cachexia-related indicators such as serum biomarkers, skeletal muscle measurements, and metabolic abnormalities often overlap with other conditions. Existing composite indices, including the Cancer Cachexia Index (CXI), Modified CXI (mCXI), and Cachexia Score (CASCO), integrate multiple biomarkers but lack standardized thresholds, limiting their clinical utility. This study proposes a multimodal AI-based biomarker for early cancer cachexia detection, leveraging open-source large language models (LLMs) and foundation models trained on medical data. The approach integrates heterogeneous patient data, including demographics, disease status, lab reports, radiological imaging (CT scans), and clinical notes, using a machine learning framework that can handle missing data. Unlike previous AI-based models trained on curated datasets, this method utilizes routinely collected clinical data, enhancing real-world applicability. Additionally, the model incorporates confidence estimation, allowing the identification of cases requiring expert review for precise clinical interpretation. Preliminary findings demonstrate that integrating multiple data modalities improves cachexia prediction accuracy at the time of cancer diagnosis. The AI-based biomarker dynamically adapts to patient-specific factors such as age, race, ethnicity, weight, cancer type, and stage, avoiding the limitations of fixed-threshold biomarkers. This multimodal AI biomarker provides a scalable and clinically viable solution for early cancer cachexia detection, facilitating personalized interventions and potentially improving treatment outcomes and patient survival.

Title: Physically Large Apertures for Wireless Power Transfer: Performance and Regulatory Aspects
Authors: Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann, Ulrich Muehlmann, Ahmet Kaplan, Gilles Callebaut, Thomas Wilding, Bert Cox, Liesbet Van der Perre, Fredrik Tufvesson, Erik G. Larsson, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: Wireless power transfer (WPT) is a promising service for the Internet of Things, providing a cost-effective and sustainable solution to deploy so-called energy-neutral devices on a massive scale. The power received at the device side decays rapidly with the distance from a conventional transmit antenna with a physically small aperture. New opportunities arise from the transition from conventional far-field beamforming to near-field beam focusing. We argue that a "physically large" aperture, i.e., large w.r.t. the distance to the receiver, enables a power budget that remains practically independent of distance. Distance-dependent array gain patterns allow focusing the power density maximum precisely at the device location, while reducing the power density near the infrastructure. The physical aperture size is a key resource in enabling efficient yet regulatory-compliant WPT. We use real-world measurements to demonstrate that a regulatory-compliant system operating at sub-10GHz frequencies can increase the power received at the device into the milliwatt range. Our empirical demonstration shows that power-optimal near-field beam focusing inherently exploits multipath propagation, yielding both increased WPT efficiency and improved human exposure safety in real-world scenarios.

Title: Interactive Tumor Progression Modeling via Sketch-Based Image Editing
Authors: Gexin Huang, Ruinan Jin, Yucheng Tang, Can Zhao, Tatsuya Harada, Xiaoxiao Li, Gu Lin
Abstract: Accurately visualizing and editing tumor progression in medical imaging is crucial for diagnosis, treatment planning, and clinical communication. To address the challenges of subjectivity and limited precision in existing methods, we propose SkEditTumor, a sketch-based diffusion model for controllable tumor progression editing. By leveraging sketches as structural priors, our method enables precise modifications of tumor regions while maintaining structural integrity and visual realism. We evaluate SkEditTumor on four public datasets - BraTS, LiTS, KiTS, and MSD-Pancreas - covering diverse organs and imaging modalities. Experimental results demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, achieving superior image fidelity and segmentation accuracy. Our contributions include a novel integration of sketches with diffusion models for medical image editing, fine-grained control over tumor progression visualization, and extensive validation across multiple datasets, setting a new benchmark in the field.

Title: Semi-Supervised Medical Image Segmentation via Knowledge Mining from Large Models
Authors: Yuchen Mao, Hongwei Li, Yinyi Lai, Giorgos Papanastasiou, Peng Qi, Yunjie Yang, Chengjia Wang
Abstract: Large-scale vision models like SAM have extensive visual knowledge, yet their general nature and computational demands limit their use in specialized tasks like medical image segmentation. In contrast, task-specific models such as U-Net++ often underperform due to sparse labeled data. This study introduces a strategic knowledge mining method that leverages SAM's broad understanding to boost the performance of small, locally hosted deep learning models. In our approach, we trained a U-Net++ model on a limited labeled dataset and extend its capabilities by converting SAM's output infered on unlabeled images into prompts. This process not only harnesses SAM's generalized visual knowledge but also iteratively improves SAM's prediction to cater specialized medical segmentation tasks via U-Net++. The mined knowledge, serving as "pseudo labels", enriches the training dataset, enabling the fine-tuning of the local network. Applied to the Kvasir SEG and COVID-QU-Ex datasets which consist of gastrointestinal polyp and lung X-ray images respectively, our proposed method consistently enhanced the segmentation performance on Dice by 3% and 1% respectively over the baseline U-Net++ model, when the same amount of labelled data were used during training (75% and 50% of labelled data). Remarkably, our proposed method surpassed the baseline U-Net++ model even when the latter was trained exclusively on labeled data (100% of labelled data). These results underscore the potential of knowledge mining to overcome data limitations in specialized models by leveraging the broad, albeit general, knowledge of large-scale models like SAM, all while maintaining operational efficiency essential for clinical applications.

Title: Design Optimal Backstepping Controller for Quadrotor Based on Lyapunov Theory for Disturbances Environments
Authors: Dong LT Tran, Thanh C Vo, Hoang T Tran, Minh T Nguyen, Hai T. Do
Abstract: Various control methods have been studied to control the position and attitude of quadrotors. There are some differences in the mathematical equations between the two types of quadrotor configurations that lead to different control efficiency in disturbance environments. This paper described the nonlinear back stepping approach based on the Lyapunov function theory and LaSalle Principle for the quadrotor control system, which can provide the stability of all system states during the tracking of the desired trajectory. Accordingly, a mathematical model of the cross quadrotor configuration together with the controller has been built to stabilize the altitude and position of the quadrotor. To clarify the effectiveness of this method with the selected quadrotor configuration, we compare it with a traditional PID controller in an environment affected by disturbances. The simulation results in MATLAB show satisfactory stability of the quadrotor flight and following certain trajectories, confirming the accuracy and validity of the control method.

Title: Recursive Estimation for Dynamical Systems with Measurement Bias, Outliers and Constraints
Authors: Krishan Mohan Nagpal
Abstract: This paper describes recursive algorithms for state estimation of linear dynamical systems when measurements are noisy with unknown bias and/or outliers. For situations with noisy and biased measurements, algorithms are proposed that minimize $\epsilon$ insensitive loss function. In this approach which is often used in Support Vector Machines, small errors are ignored making the algorithm less sensitive to measurement bias. Apart from $\epsilon$ insensitive quadratic loss function, estimation algorithms are also presented for $\epsilon$ insensitive Huber M loss function which provides good performance in presence of both small noises as well as outliers. The advantage of Huber cost function based estimator in presence of outliers is due to the fact the error penalty function switches from quadratic to linear for errors beyond a certain threshold. For both objective functions, estimation algorithms are extended to cases when there are additional constraints on states and exogenous signals such as known range of some states or exogenous signals or measurement noises. Interestingly, the filtering algorithms are recursive and structurally similar to Kalman filter with the main difference being that the updates based on the new measurement ("innovation term") are based on solution of a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints.

Title: Two-stage Deep Denoising with Self-guided Noise Attention for Multimodal Medical Images
Authors: S M A Sharif, Rizwan Ali Naqvi, Woong-Kee Loh
Abstract: Medical image denoising is considered among the most challenging vision tasks. Despite the real-world implications, existing denoising methods have notable drawbacks as they often generate visual artifacts when applied to heterogeneous medical images. This study addresses the limitation of the contemporary denoising methods with an artificial intelligence (AI)-driven two-stage learning strategy. The proposed method learns to estimate the residual noise from the noisy images. Later, it incorporates a novel noise attention mechanism to correlate estimated residual noise with noisy inputs to perform denoising in a course-to-refine manner. This study also proposes to leverage a multi-modal learning strategy to generalize the denoising among medical image modalities and multiple noise patterns for widespread applications. The practicability of the proposed method has been evaluated with dense experiments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed method achieved state-of-the-art performance by significantly outperforming the existing medical image denoising methods in quantitative and qualitative comparisons. Overall, it illustrates a performance gain of 7.64 in Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR), 0.1021 in Structural Similarity Index (SSIM), 0.80 in DeltaE ($\Delta E$), 0.1855 in Visual Information Fidelity Pixel-wise (VIFP), and 18.54 in Mean Squared Error (MSE) metrics.

Title: Towards a Multimodal MRI-Based Foundation Model for Multi-Level Feature Exploration in Segmentation, Molecular Subtyping, and Grading of Glioma
Authors: Somayeh Farahani, Marjaneh Hejazi, Antonio Di Ieva, Emad Fatemizadeh, Sidong Liu
Abstract: Accurate, noninvasive glioma characterization is crucial for effective clinical management. Traditional methods, dependent on invasive tissue sampling, often fail to capture the spatial heterogeneity of the tumor. While deep learning has improved segmentation and molecular profiling, few approaches simultaneously integrate tumor morphology and molecular features. Foundation deep learning models, which learn robust, task-agnostic representations from large-scale datasets, hold great promise but remain underutilized in glioma imaging biomarkers. We propose the Multi-Task SWIN-UNETR (MTS-UNET) model, a novel foundation-based framework built on the BrainSegFounder model, pretrained on large-scale neuroimaging data. MTS-UNET simultaneously performs glioma segmentation, histological grading, and molecular subtyping (IDH mutation and 1p/19q co-deletion). It incorporates two key modules: Tumor-Aware Feature Encoding (TAFE) for multi-scale, tumor-focused feature extraction and Cross-Modality Differential (CMD) for highlighting subtle T2-FLAIR mismatch signals associated with IDH mutation. The model was trained and validated on a diverse, multi-center cohort of 2,249 glioma patients from seven public datasets. MTS-UNET achieved a mean Dice score of 84% for segmentation, along with AUCs of 90.58% for IDH mutation, 69.22% for 1p/19q co-deletion prediction, and 87.54% for grading, significantly outperforming baseline models (p<=0.05). Ablation studies validated the essential contributions of the TAFE and CMD modules and demonstrated the robustness of the framework. The foundation-based MTS-UNET model effectively integrates tumor segmentation with multi-level classification, exhibiting strong generalizability across diverse MRI datasets. This framework shows significant potential for advancing noninvasive, personalized glioma management by improving predictive accuracy and interpretability.

Title: Distributed Resource Block Allocation for Wideband Cell-free System
Authors: Yang Ma, Shengqian Han, Chenyang Yang
Abstract: This paper studies distributed resource block (RB) allocation in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) cell-free systems. We propose a novel distributed sequential algorithm and its two variants, which optimize RB allocation based on the information obtained through over-the-air (OTA) transmissions between access points (APs) and user equipments, enabling local decision updates at each AP. To reduce the overhead of OTA transmission, we further develop a distributed deep learning (DL)-based method to learn the RB allocation policy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed distributed algorithms perform close to the centralized algorithm, while the DL-based method outperforms existing baseline methods.

Title: Reinforcement Learning Based Symbolic Regression for Load Modeling
Authors: Ding Lin, Han Guo, Jianhui Wang, Meng Yue, Tianqiao Zhao
Abstract: With the increasing penetration of renewable energy sources, growing demand variability, and evolving grid control strategies, accurate and efficient load modeling has become a critical yet challenging task. Traditional methods, such as fixed-form parametric models and data-driven approaches, often struggle to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and interpretability. This paper introduces a novel symbolic regression algorithm based on the Actor-Critic reinforcement learning framework, specifically tailored for dynamic load modeling. The algorithm employs a trainable expression tree with controlled depth and a predefined set of operators to generate compact and interpretable mathematical expressions. The Actor network probabilistically selects operators for the symbolic expression, while the Critic evaluates the resulting expression tree through a loss function. To further enhance performance, a candidate pool mechanism is implemented to store high-performing expressions, which are subsequently fine-tuned using gradient descent. By focusing on simplicity and precision, the proposed method significantly reduces computational complexity while preserving interpretability. Experimental results validate its superior performance compared to existing benchmarks, which offers a robust and scalable solution for dynamic load modeling and system analysis in modern power systems.

Title: Distributed Pose Graph Optimization using the Splitting Method based on the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers
Authors: Zeinab Ebrahimi, Mohammad Deghat
Abstract: Distributed optimization aims to leverage the local computation and communication capabilities of each agent to achieve a desired global objective. This paper addresses the distributed pose graph optimization (PGO) problem under non-convex constraints, with the goal of approximating the rotation and translation of each pose given relevant noisy measurements. To achieve this goal, the splitting method based on the concepts of the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) and Bregman iteration are applied to solve the rotation subproblems. The proposed approach enables the iterative resolution of constrained problems, achieved through solving unconstrained problems and orthogonality-constrained quadratic problems that have analytical solutions. The performance of the proposed algorithm is compared against two practical methods in pose graph optimization: the Distributed Gauss-Seidel (DGS) algorithm and the centralized pose graph optimizer with an optimality certificate (SE-Sync). The efficiency of the proposed method is verified through its application to several simulated and real-world pose graph datasets. Unlike the DGS method, our approach attempts to solve distributed PGO problems without relaxing the non-convex constraints.

Title: CAFusion: Controllable Anatomical Synthesis of Perirectal Lymph Nodes via SDF-guided Diffusion
Authors: Weidong Guo, Hantao Zhang, Shouhong Wan, Bingbing Zou, Wanqin Wang, Chenyang Qiu, Peiquan Jin
Abstract: Lesion synthesis methods have made significant progress in generating large-scale synthetic datasets. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on texture synthesis and often fail to accurately model masks for anatomically complex lesions. Additionally, these methods typically lack precise control over the synthesis process. For example, perirectal lymph nodes, which range in diameter from 1 mm to 10 mm, exhibit irregular and intricate contours that are challenging for current techniques to replicate faithfully. To address these limitations, we introduce CAFusion, a novel approach for synthesizing perirectal lymph nodes. By leveraging Signed Distance Functions (SDF), CAFusion generates highly realistic 3D anatomical structures. Furthermore, it offers flexible control over both anatomical and textural features by decoupling the generation of morphological attributes (such as shape, size, and position) from textural characteristics, including signal intensity. Experimental results demonstrate that our synthetic data substantially improve segmentation performance, achieving a 6.45% increase in the Dice coefficient. In the visual Turing test, experienced radiologists found it challenging to distinguish between synthetic and real lesions, highlighting the high degree of realism and anatomical accuracy achieved by our approach. These findings validate the effectiveness of our method in generating high-quality synthetic lesions for advancing medical image processing applications.

Authors: Tyrone Fernando, Mohamed Darouach
Abstract: This paper introduces new conditions for target output controllability and provides existence conditions for placing a specific number of poles with a target output controller. Additionally, an algorithm is presented for the design of a target output controller. Controllability of the system under consideration is not required for designing target output controllers in this context. The findings in this paper extend the principles of full state feedback control. Moreover, we present conditions for static output feedback control under specific constraints. Several numerical examples are provided to illustrate the results.

Title: Graph Neural Network for Location- and Orientation-Assisted mmWave Beam Alignment
Authors: Yuzhu Lei, Qiqi Xiao, Yinghui He, Guanding Yu
Abstract: In massive multi-input multi-output (MIMO) systems, the main bottlenecks of location- and orientation-assisted beam alignment using deep neural networks (DNNs) are large training overhead and significant performance degradation. This paper proposes a graph neural network (GNN)-based beam selection approach that reduces the training overhead and improves the alignment accuracy, by capitalizing on the strong expressive ability and few trainable parameters of GNN. The channels of beams are correlated according to the beam direction. Therefore, we establish a graph according to the angular correlation between beams and use GNN to capture the channel correlation between adjacent beams, which helps accelerate the learning process and enhance the beam alignment performance. Compared to existing DNN-based algorithms, the proposed method requires only 20\% of the dataset size to achieve equivalent accuracy and improves the Top-1 accuracy by 10\% when using the same dataset.

Title: Dynamic Cross-Modal Feature Interaction Network for Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data Classification
Authors: Junyan Lin, Feng Gap, Lin Qi, Junyu Dong, Qian Du, Xinbo Gao
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) and LiDAR data joint classification is a challenging task. Existing multi-source remote sensing data classification methods often rely on human-designed frameworks for feature extraction, which heavily depend on expert knowledge. To address these limitations, we propose a novel Dynamic Cross-Modal Feature Interaction Network (DCMNet), the first framework leveraging a dynamic routing mechanism for HSI and LiDAR classification. Specifically, our approach introduces three feature interaction blocks: Bilinear Spatial Attention Block (BSAB), Bilinear Channel Attention Block (BCAB), and Integration Convolutional Block (ICB). These blocks are designed to effectively enhance spatial, spectral, and discriminative feature interactions. A multi-layer routing space with routing gates is designed to determine optimal computational paths, enabling data-dependent feature fusion. Additionally, bilinear attention mechanisms are employed to enhance feature interactions in spatial and channel representations. Extensive experiments on three public HSI and LiDAR datasets demonstrate the superiority of DCMNet over state-of-the-art methods. Our code will be available at this https URL.

Title: EnCortex: A General, Extensible and Scalable Framework for Decision Management in New-age Energy Systems
Authors: Millend Roy, Vaibhav Balloli, Anupam Sobti, Srinivasan Iyengar, Shivkumar Kalyanaraman, Tanuja Ganu, Akshay Nambi
Abstract: With increased global warming, there has been a significant emphasis to replace fossil fuel-dependent energy sources with clean, renewable sources. These new-age energy systems are becoming more complex with an increasing proportion of renewable energy sources (like solar and wind), energy storage systems (like batteries), and demand side control in the mix. Most new-age sources being highly dependent on weather and climate conditions bring about high variability and uncertainty. Energy operators rely on such uncertain data to make different planning and operations decisions periodically, and sometimes in real-time, to maintain the grid stability and optimize their objectives (cost savings, carbon footprint, etc.). Hitherto, operators mostly rely on domain knowledge, heuristics, or solve point problems to take decisions. These approaches fall short because of their specific assumptions and limitations. Further, there is a lack of a unified framework for both research and production environments at scale. In this paper, we propose EnCortex to address these challenges. EnCortex provides a general, easy-to-use, extensible, and scalable energy decision framework that enables operators to plan, build and execute their real-world scenarios efficiently. We show that using EnCortex, we can define and compose complex new-age scenarios, owing to industry-standard abstractions of energy entities and the modularity of the framework. EnCortex provides a foundational structure to support several state-of-the-art optimizers with minimal effort. EnCortex supports both quick developments for research prototypes and scaling the solutions to production environments. We demonstrate the utility of EnCortex with three complex new-age real-world scenarios and show that significant cost and carbon footprint savings can be achieved.

Title: Graph Chirp Signal and Graph Fractional Vertex-Frequency Energy Distribution
Authors: Manjun Cui, Zhichao Zhang
Abstract: Graph signal processing (GSP) has emerged as a powerful framework for analyzing data on irregular domains. In recent years, many classical techniques in signal processing (SP) have been successfully extended to GSP. Among them, chirp signals play a crucial role in various SP applications. However, graph chirp signals have not been formally defined despite their importance. Here, we define graph chirp signals and establish a comprehensive theoretical framework for their analysis. We propose the graph fractional vertex-frequency energy distribution (GFED), which provides a powerful tool for processing and analyzing graph chirp signals. We introduce the general fractional graph distribution (GFGD), a generalized vertex-frequency distribution, and the reduced interference GFED, which can suppress cross-term interference and enhance signal clarity. Furthermore, we propose a novel method for detecting graph signals through GFED domain filtering, facilitating robust detection and analysis of graph chirp signals in noisy environments. Moreover, this method can be applied to real-world data for denoising more effective than some state-of-the-arts, further demonstrating its practical significance.

Title: Explicit Solution of Tunable Input-to-State Safe-Based Controller Under High-Relative-Degree Constraints
Authors: Yan Wei, Yu Feng, Linlin Ou, Yueying Wang, Xinyi Yu
Abstract: This paper investigates the safety analysis and verification of nonlinear systems subject to high-relative-degree constraints and unknown disturbance. The closed-form solution of the high-order control barrier functions (HOCBF) optimization problem with and without a nominal controller is first provided, making it unnecessary to solve the quadratic program problem online and facilitating the analysis. Further, we introduce the concept of tunable input-to-state safety(ISSf), and a new tunable function in conjunction with HOCBF is provided. When combined with the existing ISSf theorem, produces controllers for constrained nonlinear systems with external disturbances. The theoretical results are proven and supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Adaptive Extensive Cancellation Algorithm and Harmonic Enhanced Heart Rate Estimation based on MMWave Radar
Authors: Hui Tang, Zhan Yang, Yu Rong, Li Chai
Abstract: Heart rate (HR) monitoring is crucial for assessing physical fitness, cardiovascular health, and stress management. Millimeter-wave radar offers a promising noncontact solution for long-term monitoring. However, accurate HR estimation remains challenging in low signal-tonoise ratio (SNR) conditions. To deal with both respiration harmonics and intermodulation interference, this paper proposes a cancellation-before-estimation strategy. Firstly, we present the adaptive extensive cancellation algorithm (ECA) to suppress respiratory and its low-order harmonics. Then, we propose an adaptive harmonic enhanced trace (AHET) method to avoid intermodulation interference by refining the HR search region. Various experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed methods, demonstrating improvements in accuracy, robustness, and computational efficiency compared to conventional approaches based on the FMCW (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave) system

Title: A Comprehensive Survey on Magnetic Resonance Image Reconstruction
Authors: Xiaoyan Kui, Zijie Fan, Zexin Ji, Qinsong Li, Chengtao Liu, Weixin Si, Beiji Zou
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) reconstruction is a fundamental task aimed at recovering high-quality images from undersampled or low-quality MRI data. This process enhances diagnostic accuracy and optimizes clinical applications. In recent years, deep learning-based MRI reconstruction has made significant progress. Advancements include single-modality feature extraction using different network architectures, the integration of multimodal information, and the adoption of unsupervised or semi-supervised learning strategies. However, despite extensive research, MRI reconstruction remains a challenging problem that has yet to be fully resolved. This survey provides a systematic review of MRI reconstruction methods, covering key aspects such as data acquisition and preprocessing, publicly available datasets, single and multi-modal reconstruction models, training strategies, and evaluation metrics based on image reconstruction and downstream tasks. Additionally, we analyze the major challenges in this field and explore potential future directions.

Title: Coordinated Energy-Trajectory Economic Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Surface Vehicles under Disturbances
Authors: Zhongqi Deng, Yuan Wang, Jian Huang, Hui Zhang, Yaonan Wang
Abstract: The paper proposes a novel Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) scheme for Autonomous Surface Vehicles (ASVs) to simultaneously address path following accuracy and energy constraints under environmental disturbances. By formulating lateral deviations as energy-equivalent penalties in the cost function, our method enables explicit trade-offs between tracking precision and energy consumption. Furthermore, a motion-dependent decomposition technique is proposed to estimate terminal energy costs based on vehicle dynamics. Compared with the existing EMPC method, simulations with real-world ocean disturbance data demonstrate the controller's energy consumption with a 0.06 energy increase while reducing cross-track errors by up to 18.61. Field experiments conducted on an ASV equipped with an Intel N100 CPU in natural lake environments validate practical feasibility, achieving 0.22 m average cross-track error at nearly 1 m/s and 10 Hz control frequency. The proposed scheme provides a computationally tractable solution for ASVs operating under resource constraints.

Title: Global Context Is All You Need for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation
Authors: Valentin von Bornhaupt, Johannes Gr√ºn, and Justus Bisten, Tobias Bauer, Theodor R√ºber, Thomas Schultz
Abstract: Whole-brain tractography in diffusion MRI is often followed by a parcellation in which each streamline is classified as belonging to a specific white matter bundle, or discarded as a false positive. Efficient parcellation is important both in large-scale studies, which have to process huge amounts of data, and in the clinic, where computational resources are often limited. TractCloud is a state-of-the-art approach that aims to maximize accuracy with a local-global representation. We demonstrate that the local context does not contribute to the accuracy of that approach, and is even detrimental when dealing with pathological cases. Based on this observation, we propose PETParc, a new method for Parallel Efficient Tractography Parcellation. PETParc is a transformer-based architecture in which the whole-brain tractogram is randomly partitioned into sub-tractograms whose streamlines are classified in parallel, while serving as global context for each other. This leads to a speedup of up to two orders of magnitude relative to TractCloud, and permits inference even on clinical workstations without a GPU. PETParc accounts for the lack of streamline orientation either via a novel flip-invariant embedding, or by simply using flips as part of data augmentation. Despite the speedup, results are often even better than those of prior methods. The code and pretrained model will be made public upon acceptance.

Title: Efficient Integration of Distributed Learning Services in Next-Generation Wireless Networks
Authors: Paul Zheng, Navid Keshtiarast, Pradyumna Kumar Bishoyi, Yao Zhu, Yulin Hu, Marina Petrova, Anke Schmeink
Abstract: Distributed learning (DL) is considered a cornerstone of intelligence enabler, since it allows for collaborative training without the necessity for local clients to share raw data with other parties, thereby preserving privacy and security. Integrating DL into the 6G networks requires coexistence design with existing services such as high-bandwidth (HB) traffic like eMBB. Current designs in the literature mainly focus on communication round (CR)-wise designs that assume a fixed resource allocation during each CR. However, fixed resource allocation within a CR is a highly inefficient and inaccurate representation of the system's realistic behavior. This is due to the heterogeneous nature of the system, where clients inherently need to access the network at different times. This work zooms into one arbitrary communication round and demonstrates the importance of considering a time-dependent resource-sharing design with HB traffic. We propose a time-dependent optimization problem for minimizing the consumed time and energy by DL within the CR. Due to its intractability, a session-based optimization problem has been proposed assuming a large-scale coherence time. An iterative algorithm has been designed to solve such problems and simulation results confirm the importance of such efficient and accurate integration design.

Title: Frequency Diverse Array OFDM Transmit System with Partial Overlap in Frequency
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, Andr√© Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: Frequency-diverse array (FDA) is an alternative array architecture in which each antenna is preceded by a mixer instead of a phase shifter. The mixers introduce a frequency offset between signals transmitted by each antenna resulting in a time-varying beam pattern. However, time-dependent beamforming is not desirable for communication or sensing. In this paper, the FDA is combined with orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) modulation. The proposed beamforming method splits the OFDM symbol transmitted by all antennas into subcarrier blocks, which are precoded differently. The selected frequency offset between the antennas results in overlap and coherent summation of the differently precoded subcarrier blocks. This allows to achieve fully digital beamforming over a single block with the use of a single digital-to-analog converter. The system's joint communication and sensing performance is evaluated and sensitivity to errors is studied.

Title: The 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas: spatiotemporal atlas generation for rapid anatomical changes using first-trimester ultrasound from the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort
Authors: Wietske A.P. Bastiaansen, Melek Rousian, Anton H.J. Koning, Wiro J. Niessen, Bernadette S. de Bakker, R√©gine P.M. Steegers-Theunissen, Stefan Klein
Abstract: Early brain development is crucial for lifelong neurodevelopmental health. However, current clinical practice offers limited knowledge of normal embryonic brain anatomy on ultrasound, despite the brain undergoing rapid changes within the time-span of days. To provide detailed insights into normal brain development and identify deviations, we created the 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas using a deep learning-based approach for groupwise registration and spatiotemporal atlas generation. Our method introduced a time-dependent initial atlas and penalized deviations from it, ensuring age-specific anatomy was maintained throughout rapid development. The atlas was generated and validated using 831 3D ultrasound images from 402 subjects in the Rotterdam Periconceptional Cohort, acquired between gestational weeks 8 and 12. We evaluated the effectiveness of our approach with an ablation study, which demonstrated that incorporating a time-dependent initial atlas and penalization produced anatomically accurate results. In contrast, omitting these adaptations led to anatomically incorrect atlas. Visual comparisons with an existing ex-vivo embryo atlas further confirmed the anatomical accuracy of our atlas. In conclusion, the proposed method successfully captures the rapid anotomical development of the embryonic brain. The resulting 4D Human Embryonic Brain Atlas provides a unique insights into this crucial early life period and holds the potential for improving the detection, prevention, and treatment of prenatal neurodevelopmental disorders.

Title: Aliased Time-Modulated Array OFDM System
Authors: Marcin Wachowiak, Andr√© Bourdoux, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: The time-modulated array is a simple array architecture in which each antenna is connected to an RF switch that serves as a modulator. The phase shift is achieved by digitally controlling the relative delay between the periodic modulating sequences of the antennas. The practical use of this architecture is limited by two factors. First, the switching frequency is high, as it must be a multiple of the sampling frequency. Second, the discrete modulating sequence introduces undesired harmonic replicas of the signal with non-negligible power. In this paper, aliasing is exploited to simultaneously reduce sideband radiation and switching frequency. To facilitate coherent combining of aliased signal blocks, the transmit signal has a repeated block structure in the frequency domain. As a result, a factor $A$ reduction in switching frequency is achieved at the cost of a factor $A$ reduction in communication capacity. Doubling $A$ reduces sideband radiation by around 2.9 dB.

Title: Communication-aware Multi-agent Systems Control Based on $k$-hop Distributed Observers
Authors: Tommaso Zaccherini, Siyuan Liu, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: We propose a distributed control strategy to allow the control of a multi-agent system requiring k-hop interactions based on the design of distributed state and input observers. In particular, we design for each agent a finite time convergent state and input observer that exploits only the communication with the 1-hop neighbors to reconstruct the information regarding those agents at a 2-hop distance or more. We then demonstrate that if the k-hop based control strategy is set-Input to State Stable with respect to the set describing the goal, then the observer information can be adopted to achieve the team objective with stability guarantees.

Title: AI-Driven Automated Tool for Abdominal CT Body Composition Analysis in Gastrointestinal Cancer Management
Authors: Xinyu Nan, Meng He, Zifan Chen, Bin Dong, Lei Tang, Li Zhang
Abstract: The incidence of gastrointestinal cancers remains significantly high, particularly in China, emphasizing the importance of accurate prognostic assessments and effective treatment strategies. Research shows a strong correlation between abdominal muscle and fat tissue composition and patient outcomes. However, existing manual methods for analyzing abdominal tissue composition are time-consuming and costly, limiting clinical research scalability. To address these challenges, we developed an AI-driven tool for automated analysis of abdominal CT scans to effectively identify and segment muscle, subcutaneous fat, and visceral fat. Our tool integrates a multi-view localization model and a high-precision 2D nnUNet-based segmentation model, demonstrating a localization accuracy of 90% and a Dice Score Coefficient of 0.967 for segmentation. Furthermore, it features an interactive interface that allows clinicians to refine the segmentation results, ensuring high-quality outcomes effectively. Our tool offers a standardized method for effectively extracting critical abdominal tissues, potentially enhancing the management and treatment for gastrointestinal cancers.

Title: DeepNuParc: A Novel Deep Clustering Framework for Fine-scale Parcellation of Brain Nuclei Using Diffusion MRI Tractography
Authors: Haolin He, Ce Zhu, Le Zhang, Yipeng Liu, Xiao Xu, Yuqian Chen, Leo Zekelman, Jarrett Rushmore, Yogesh Rathi, Nikos Makris, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Fan Zhang
Abstract: Brain nuclei are clusters of anatomically distinct neurons that serve as important hubs for processing and relaying information in various neural circuits. Fine-scale parcellation of the brain nuclei is vital for a comprehensive understanding of its anatomico-functional correlations. Diffusion MRI tractography is an advanced imaging technique that can estimate the brain's white matter structural connectivity to potentially reveal the topography of the nuclei of interest for studying its subdivisions. In this work, we present a deep clustering pipeline, namely DeepNuParc, to perform automated, fine-scale parcellation of brain nuclei using diffusion MRI tractography. First, we incorporate a newly proposed deep learning approach to enable accurate segmentation of the nuclei of interest directly on the dMRI data. Next, we design a novel streamline clustering-based structural connectivity feature for a robust representation of voxels within the nuclei. Finally, we improve the popular joint dimensionality reduction and k-means clustering approach to enable nuclei parcellation at a finer scale. We demonstrate DeepNuParc on two important brain structures, i.e. the amygdala and the thalamus, that are known to have multiple anatomically and functionally distinct nuclei subdivisions. Experimental results show that DeepNuParc enables consistent parcellation of the nuclei into multiple parcels across multiple subjects and achieves good correspondence with the widely used coarse-scale atlases.

Title: Secure Wireless-Powered zeRIS Communications
Authors: Jingyu Chen, Kunrui Cao, Panagiotis D. Diamantoulakis, Lu Lv, Liang Yang, Haolian Chi, Haiyang Ding
Abstract: This paper introduces the concept of wireless-powered zero-energy reconfigurable intelligent surface (zeRIS), and investigates a wireless-powered zeRIS aided communication system in terms of security, reliability and energy efficiency. In particular, we propose three new wireless-powered zeRIS modes: 1) in mode-I, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of information user to maximize the reliability of the system; 2) in mode-II, N reconfigurable reflecting elements are adjusted to the optimal phase shift design of cooperative jamming user to maximize the security of the system; 3) in mode-III, N1 and N2 (N1+N2=N) reconfigurable reflecting elements are respectively adjusted to the optimal phase shift designs of information user and cooperative jamming user to balance the reliability and security of the system. Then, we propose three new metrics, i.e., joint outage probability (JOP), joint intercept probability (JIP), and secrecy energy efficiency (SEE), and analyze their closed-form expressions in three modes, respectively. The results show that under high transmission power, all the diversity gains of three modes are 1, and the JOPs of mode-I, mode-II and mode-III are improved by increasing the number of zeRIS elements, which are related to N2, N, and N^2_1, respectively. In addition, mode-I achieves the best JOP, while mode-II achieves the best JIP among three modes. We exploit two security-reliability trade-off (SRT) metrics, i.e., JOP versus JIP, and normalized joint intercept and outage probability (JIOP), to reveal the SRT performance of the proposed three modes. It is obtained that mode-II outperforms the other two modes in the JOP versus JIP, while mode-III and mode-II achieve the best performance of normalized JIOP at low and high transmission power, respectively.

Title: Data-Driven Calibration Technique for Quantitative Inversion
Authors: Zacharie Idriss, Raghu Raj
Abstract: Quantitative inversion algorithms allow for the reconstruction of electrical properties (such as permittivity, and conductivity) for every point in a scene. However, they are challenging to use on measured datasets due to the need to know the incident wave field in the scene. In general, this is unknown due to factors such as antenna characteristics, path loss, waveform factors, etc. In this paper, we introduce a scalar calibration factor to account for these factors. To solve for the calibration factor, we augment the inversion procedure by including the forward problem, which we solve by training a simple feed-forward fully connected neural network to learn a mapping between the underlying permittivity distribution and the scattered field at the radar. We then minimize the mismatch between the measured and simulated fields to optimize the scalar calibration factor for each transmitter. We use the Fresnel Institute dataset to test our algorithm.

Title: Optimal Control Selection over the Edge-Cloud Continuum
Authors: Xiyu Gu, Matthias Pezzutto, Luca Schenato, Subhrakanti Dey
Abstract: The emerging computing continuum paves the way for exploiting multiple computing devices, ranging from the edge to the cloud, to implement the control algorithm. Different computing units over the continuum are characterized by different computational capabilities and communication latencies, thus resulting in different control performances and advocating for an effective trade-off. To this end, in this work, we first introduce a multi-tiered controller and we propose a simple network delay compensator. Then we propose a control selection policy to optimize the control cost taking into account the delay and the disturbances. We theoretically investigate the stability of the switching system resulting from the proposed control selection policy. Accurate simulations show the improvements of the considered setup.

Title: Score-informed Music Source Separation: Improving Synthetic-to-real Generalization in Classical Music
Authors: Eetu Tunturi, David Diaz-Guerra, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: Music source separation is the task of separating a mixture of instruments into constituent tracks. Music source separation models are typically trained using only audio data, although additional information can be used to improve the model's separation capability. In this paper, we propose two ways of using musical scores to aid music source separation: a score-informed model where the score is concatenated with the magnitude spectrogram of the audio mixture as the input of the model, and a model where we use only the score to calculate the separation mask. We train our models on synthetic data in the SynthSOD dataset and evaluate our methods on the URMP and Aalto anechoic orchestra datasets, comprised of real recordings. The score-informed model improves separation results compared to a baseline approach, but struggles to generalize from synthetic to real data, whereas the score-only model shows a clear improvement in synthetic-to-real generalization.

Title: Impact of Microphone Array Mismatches to Learning-based Replay Speech Detection
Authors: Michael Neri, Tuomas Virtanen
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the generalization of a multi-channel learning-based replay speech detector, which employs adaptive beamforming and detection, across different microphone arrays. In general, deep neural network-based microphone array processing techniques generalize poorly to unseen array types, i.e., showing a significant training-test mismatch of performance. We employ the ReMASC dataset to analyze performance degradation due to inter- and intra-device mismatches, assessing both single- and multi-channel configurations. Furthermore, we explore fine-tuning to mitigate the performance loss when transitioning to unseen microphone arrays. Our findings reveal that array mismatches significantly decrease detection accuracy, with intra-device generalization being more robust than inter-device. However, fine-tuning with as little as ten minutes of target data can effectively recover performance, providing insights for practical deployment of replay detection systems in heterogeneous automatic speaker verification environments.

Title: $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Loop-shaping for Power Tracking Control of Wind Turbines
Authors: Aaron Grapentin, Christian A. Hans, J√∂rg Raisch
Abstract: In this paper, we present an advanced wind turbine control scheme for power maximization as well as for active power control, which is designed using $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ loop-shaping. Our approach involves the synthesis of two separate controllers for two different operating modes. To ensure smooth transitions between these modes, we implement a bumpless transfer strategy that reduces transient effects. A comprehensive case study demonstrates the efficacy of our control scheme, showing significant improvements in power tracking accuracy and a reduction in mechanical wear. Moreover, our control strategy comes with robust stability guarantees.

Title: Skelite: Compact Neural Networks for Efficient Iterative Skeletonization
Authors: Luis D. Reyes Vargas, Martin J. Menten, Johannes C. Paetzold, Nassir Navab, Mohammad Farid Azampour
Abstract: Skeletonization extracts thin representations from images that compactly encode their geometry and topology. These representations have become an important topological prior for preserving connectivity in curvilinear structures, aiding medical tasks like vessel segmentation. Existing compatible skeletonization algorithms face significant trade-offs: morphology-based approaches are computationally efficient but prone to frequent breakages, while topology-preserving methods require substantial computational resources. We propose a novel framework for training iterative skeletonization algorithms with a learnable component. The framework leverages synthetic data, task-specific augmentation, and a model distillation strategy to learn compact neural networks that produce thin, connected skeletons with a fully differentiable iterative algorithm. Our method demonstrates a 100 times speedup over topology-constrained algorithms while maintaining high accuracy and generalizing effectively to new domains without fine-tuning. Benchmarking and downstream validation in 2D and 3D tasks demonstrate its computational efficiency and real-world applicability

Title: AttentionSwarm: Reinforcement Learning with Attention Control Barier Function for Crazyflie Drones in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Grik Tadevosyan, Valerii Serpiva, Aleksey Fedoseev, Roohan Ahmed Khan, Demetros Aschu, Faryal Batool, Nickolay Efanov, Artem Mikhaylov, Dzmitry Tsetserukou
Abstract: We introduce AttentionSwarm, a novel benchmark designed to evaluate safe and efficient swarm control across three challenging environments: a landing environment with obstacles, a competitive drone game setting, and a dynamic drone racing scenario. Central to our approach is the Attention Model Based Control Barrier Function (CBF) framework, which integrates attention mechanisms with safety-critical control theory to enable real-time collision avoidance and trajectory optimization. This framework dynamically prioritizes critical obstacles and agents in the swarms vicinity using attention weights, while CBFs formally guarantee safety by enforcing collision-free constraints. The safe attention net algorithm was developed and evaluated using a swarm of Crazyflie 2.1 micro quadrotors, which were tested indoors with the Vicon motion capture system to ensure precise localization and control. Experimental results show that our system achieves landing accuracy of 3.02 cm with a mean time of 23 s and collision-free landings in a dynamic landing environment, 100% and collision-free navigation in a drone game environment, and 95% and collision-free navigation for a dynamic multiagent drone racing environment, underscoring its effectiveness and robustness in real-world scenarios. This work offers a promising foundation for applications in dynamic environments where safety and fastness are paramount.

Title: Diagnostic-free onboard battery health assessment
Authors: Yunhong Che, Vivek N. Lam, Jinwook Rhyu, Joachim Schaeffer, Minsu Kim, Martin Z. Bazant, William C. Chueh, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Diverse usage patterns induce complex and variable aging behaviors in lithium-ion batteries, complicating accurate health diagnosis and prognosis. Separate diagnostic cycles are often used to untangle the battery's current state of health from prior complex aging patterns. However, these same diagnostic cycles alter the battery's degradation trajectory, are time-intensive, and cannot be practically performed in onboard applications. In this work, we leverage portions of operational measurements in combination with an interpretable machine learning model to enable rapid, onboard battery health diagnostics and prognostics without offline diagnostic testing and the requirement of historical data. We integrate mechanistic constraints within an encoder-decoder architecture to extract electrode states in a physically interpretable latent space and enable improved reconstruction of the degradation path. The health diagnosis model framework can be flexibly applied across diverse application interests with slight fine-tuning. We demonstrate the versatility of this model framework by applying it to three battery-cycling datasets consisting of 422 cells under different operating conditions, highlighting the utility of an interpretable diagnostic-free, onboard battery diagnosis and prognosis model.

Title: Stochastic Tube-based Model Predictive Control for Cyber-Physical Systems under False Data Injection Attacks with Bounded Probability
Authors: Yuzhou Xiao, Senchun Chai, Li Dai, Yuanqing Xia, Runqi Chai
Abstract: This paper addresses the challenge of amplitude-unbounded false data injection (FDI) attacks targeting the sensor-to-controller (S-C) channel in cyber-physical systems (CPSs). We introduce a resilient tube-based model predictive control (MPC) scheme. This scheme incorporates a threshold-based attack detector and a control sequence buffer to enhance system security. We mathematically model the common FDI attacks and derive the maximum duration of such attacks based on the hypothesis testing principle. Following this, the minimum feasible sequence length of the control sequence buffer is obtained. The system is proven to remain input-to-state stable (ISS) under bounded external disturbances and amplitude-unbounded FDI attacks. Moreover, the feasible region under this scenario is provided in this paper. Finally, the proposed algorithm is validated by numerical simulations and shows superior control performance compared to the existing methods.

Title: ECNN: A Low-complex, Adjustable CNN for Industrial Pump Monitoring Using Vibration Data
Authors: Jonas Ney, Norbert Wehn
Abstract: Industrial pumps are essential components in various sectors, such as manufacturing, energy production, and water treatment, where their failures can cause significant financial and safety risks. Anomaly detection can be used to reduce those risks and increase reliability. In this work, we propose a novel enhanced convolutional neural network (ECNN) to predict the failure of an industrial pump based on the vibration data captured by an acceleration sensor. The convolutional neural network (CNN) is designed with a focus on low complexity to enable its implementation on edge devices with limited computational resources. Therefore, a detailed design space exploration is performed to find a topology satisfying the trade-off between complexity and accuracy. Moreover, to allow for adaptation to unknown pumps, our algorithm features a pump-specific parameter that can be determined by a small set of normal data samples. Finally, we combine the ECNN with a threshold approach to further increase the performance and satisfy the application requirements. As a result, our combined approach significantly outperforms a traditional statistical approach and a classical CNN in terms of accuracy. To summarize, this work provides a novel, low-complex, CNN-based algorithm that is enhanced by classical methods to offer high accuracy for anomaly detection of industrial pumps.

Title: Cost-Effective Design of Grid-tied Community Microgrid
Authors: Moslem Uddin, Huadong Mo, Daoyi Dong
Abstract: This study aims to develop a cost-effective microgrid design that optimally balances the economic feasibility, reliability, efficiency, and environmental impact in a grid-tied community microgrid. A multi-objective optimization framework is employed, integrating HOMER Pro for system sizing with deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Sensitivity analyses are conducted to evaluate the system performance under varying load demand and renewable energy fluctuations, while an economic sensitivity assessment examines the impact of electricity prices and capital costs on the Levelized Cost of Energy (LCOE). The proposed microgrid configuration achieves high reliability, satisfying 100% of the load, even under adverse weather conditions. The proposed framework attains an efficiency of 91.99% while maintaining a carbon footprint of 302,747 kg/year, which is approximately 95% lower than that of the grid system. The economic analysis indicates a net present cost (NPC) of $4.83M with a competitive LCOE of $0.208/kWh. In addition, the operation cost is $201,473 per year with a capital investment of $1.42M, rendering it a financially viable alternative to conventional grid-dependent this http URL work can be valuable in identifying effective solutions for supplying reliable and cost-effective power to regional and remote areas.

Title: Sum-of-Squares Data-driven Robustly Stabilizing and Contracting Controller Synthesis for Polynomial Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Hamza El-Kebir, Melkior Ornik
Abstract: This work presents a computationally efficient approach to data-driven robust contracting controller synthesis for polynomial control-affine systems based on a sum-of-squares program. In particular, we consider the case in which a system alternates between periods of high-quality sensor data and low-quality sensor data. In the high-quality sensor data regime, we focus on robust system identification based on the data informativity framework. In low-quality sensor data regimes we employ a robustly contracting controller that is synthesized online by solving a sum-of-squares program based on data acquired in the high-quality regime, so as to limit state deviation until high-quality data is available. This approach is motivated by real-life control applications in which systems experience periodic data blackouts or occlusion, such as autonomous vehicles undergoing loss of GPS signal or solar glare in machine vision systems. We apply our approach to a planar unmanned aerial vehicle model subject to an unknown wind field, demonstrating its uses for verifiably tight control on trajectory deviation.

Title: Utilizing High Sampling Rate ADCs for Cost Efficient MIMO Radios
Authors: Agrim Gupta, Shenggang Dong, Mehmet Mert Sahin, Younghan Nam, Frederik J. Harris, Dinesh Bharadia
Abstract: In the past decade, $>$1 Gsps ADCs have become commonplace and are used in many modern 5G base station chips. A major driving force behind this adoption is the benefits of digital up/down-conversion and improved digital filtering. Recent works have also advocated for utilizing this high sampling bandwidth to fit-in multiple MIMO streams, and reduce the number of ADCs required to build MIMO base-stations. This can potentially reduce the cost of Massive MIMO RUs, since ADCs are the most expensive electronics in the base-station radio chain. However, these recent works do not model the necessary decimation filters that exist in the signal path of these high sampling rate ADCs. We show in this short paper that because of the decimation filters, there can be introduction of cross-talks which can hinder the performance of these shared ADC interfaces. We simulate the shared ADC interface with Matlab 5G toolbox for uplink MIMO, and show that these cross-talks can be mitigated by performing MMSE equalization atop the PUSCH estimated channels.

Title: NeAS: 3D Reconstruction from X-ray Images using Neural Attenuation Surface
Authors: Chengrui Zhu, Ryoichi Ishikawa, Masataka Kagesawa, Tomohisa Yuzawa, Toru Watsuji, Takeshi Oishi
Abstract: Reconstructing three-dimensional (3D) structures from two-dimensional (2D) X-ray images is a valuable and efficient technique in medical applications that requires less radiation exposure than computed tomography scans. Recent approaches that use implicit neural representations have enabled the synthesis of novel views from sparse X-ray images. However, although image synthesis has improved the accuracy, the accuracy of surface shape estimation remains insufficient. Therefore, we propose a novel approach for reconstructing 3D scenes using a Neural Attenuation Surface (NeAS) that simultaneously captures the surface geometry and attenuation coefficient fields. NeAS incorporates a signed distance function (SDF), which defines the attenuation field and aids in extracting the 3D surface within the scene. We conducted experiments using simulated and authentic X-ray images, and the results demonstrated that NeAS could accurately extract 3D surfaces within a scene using only 2D X-ray images.

Title: Building English ASR model with regional language support
Authors: Purvi Agrawal, Vikas Joshi, Bharati Patidar, Ankur Gupta, Rupesh Kumar Mehta
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel approach to developing an English Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) system that can effectively handle Hindi queries, without compromising its performance on English. We propose a novel acoustic model (AM), referred to as SplitHead with Attention (SHA) model, features shared hidden layers across languages and language-specific projection layers combined via a self-attention mechanism. This mechanism estimates the weight for each language based on input data and weighs the corresponding language-specific projection layers accordingly. Additionally, we propose a language modeling approach that interpolates n-gram models from both English and transliterated Hindi text corpora. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, with a 69.3% and 5.7% relative reduction in word error rate on Hindi and English test sets respectively when compared to a monolingual English model.

Title: Real-Time Load Estimation for Load-lifting Exoskeletons Using Insole Pressure Sensors and Machine Learning
Authors: Kaida Wu, Peihao Xiang, Chaohao Lin, Lixuan Chen, Ou Bai
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for real-time lifting-load estimation to enhance the control strategies of upper-limb assistive exoskeletons. By leveraging cost-effective insole pressure sensors, the proposed system extracts differential pressure data that minimizes disturbances from variations in body weight and sensor placement. Two modeling approaches are explored: a channel-based method that employs traditional regression techniques-Elastic Net, Support Vector Regression (SVR), and Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP)-and a map-based method that utilizes transfer learning with a pre-trained MobileNetV2 model. The experiment is in the preliminary test stage, covering load ranges from 2 kg to 10 kg in increments of 0.5 kg, and collecting data from three subjects to test the approach. In the Channel-based method, the average Weighted Mean Absolute Percentage Error(WMAPE) for three subjects showed that the SVR achieved 13.46%, with the MLP performing similarly. In the Map-based method, using data from one subject, the Fully Fine-Tuned MobileNetV2 model reached a WMAPE of 9.74%. The results indicate that the integration of insole sensor technology with advanced machine learning models provides an effective solution for dynamic load estimation, potentially reducing the risks of over- and under-compensation in exoskeleton control.

Title: Real-Time Structural Deflection Estimation in Hydraulically Actuated Systems Using 3D Flexible Multibody Simulation and DNNs
Authors: Qasim Khadim, Peter Manzl, Emil Kurvinen, Aki Mikkola, Grzegorz Orzechowski, Johannes Gerstmayr
Abstract: The precision, stability, and performance of lightweight high-strength steel structures in heavy machinery is affected by their highly nonlinear dynamics. This, in turn, makes control more difficult, simulation more computationally intensive, and achieving real-time autonomy, using standard approaches, impossible. Machine learning through data-driven, physics-informed and physics-inspired networks, however, promises more computationally efficient and accurate solutions to nonlinear dynamic problems. This study proposes a novel framework that has been developed to estimate real-time structural deflection in hydraulically actuated three-dimensional systems. It is based on SLIDE, a machine-learning-based method to estimate dynamic responses of mechanical systems subjected to forced excitations.~Further, an algorithm is introduced for the data acquisition from a hydraulically actuated system using randomized initial configurations and hydraulic pressures.~The new framework was tested on a hydraulically actuated flexible boom with various sensor combinations and lifting various payloads. The neural network was successfully trained in less time using standard parameters from PyTorch, ADAM optimizer, the various sensor inputs, and minimal output data. The SLIDE-trained neural network accelerated deflection estimation solutions by a factor of $10^7$ in reference to flexible multibody simulation batches and provided reasonable accuracy. These results support the studies goal of providing robust, real-time solutions for control, robotic manipulators, structural health monitoring, and automation problems.

Title: Joint Sampling Frequency Offset Estimation and Compensation Based on the Farrow Structure
Authors: Deijany Rodriguez Linares, Oksana Moryakova, H√•kan Johansson
Abstract: This paper introduces a sampling frequency offset (SFO) estimation method based on the Farrow structure, which is typically utilized for the SFO compensation and thereby enables a reduction of the implementation complexity of the SFO estimation. The proposed method is implemented in the time domain and works for arbitrary bandlimited signals, thus with no additional constraints on the waveform structure. Moreover, it can operate on only the real or imaginary part of a complex signal, which further reduces the estimation complexity. Furthermore, the proposed method can simultaneously estimate the SFO and additional sampling time offset (STO) and it is insensitive to other synchronization errors, like carrier frequency offset. Both the derivations of the proposed method and its implementation are presented, and through simulation examples, it is demonstrated that it can accurately estimate both SFO and STO for different types of bandlimited signals.

Title: Research the influence of road surface conditions on vibration and safety of Semi Trailer vehicle dynamics
Authors: Phat Khau Tan, Danh Nguyen Thanh
Abstract: Purpose: Depending on the road surface profile, moving speed, transport weight, etc., the vehicle's body acceleration and dynamic load coefficient change as it moves. This study's goal is to ascertain the result of the road surface's influence on the vehicle, calculate the average vehicle body displacement acceleration and dynamic load coefficient, and validate your findings through testing. To confirm the simulation model's accuracy, experimental and theoretical simulation results are compared.. Methods: The Neuton-Euler approach and the multi-body system structure separation method are used in the paper to create dynamic equations using theoretical research methods [1]. Simulations are carried out using Matlab Simulink software to examine and assess the dynamics. Results: According to ISO 8608:2016 standard [2], theoretical research results have determined the average acceleration of the vehicle body, dynamic load coefficient, horizontal sway angle, and longitudinal sway angle when the vehicle moves on profiles C, D , E, F. Experiments show that there is an error of 7.4% and 8.1% when measuring the average acceleration and dynamic load coefficient kƒëmax when the vehicle moves at a speed of 50 km/h on the road surface C compared to theory.

Title: CBW: Towards Dataset Ownership Verification for Speaker Verification via Clustering-based Backdoor Watermarking
Authors: Yiming Li, Kaiying Yan, Shuo Shao, Tongqing Zhai, Shu-Tao Xia, Zhan Qin, Dacheng Tao
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of deep learning in speaker verification, large-scale speech datasets have become valuable intellectual property. To audit and prevent the unauthorized usage of these valuable released datasets, especially in commercial or open-source scenarios, we propose a novel dataset ownership verification method. Our approach introduces a clustering-based backdoor watermark (CBW), enabling dataset owners to determine whether a suspicious third-party model has been trained on a protected dataset under a black-box setting. The CBW method consists of two key stages: dataset watermarking and ownership verification. During watermarking, we implant multiple trigger patterns in the dataset to make similar samples (measured by their feature similarities) close to the same trigger while dissimilar samples are near different triggers. This ensures that any model trained on the watermarked dataset exhibits specific misclassification behaviors when exposed to trigger-embedded inputs. To verify dataset ownership, we design a hypothesis-test-based framework that statistically evaluates whether a suspicious model exhibits the expected backdoor behavior. We conduct extensive experiments on benchmark datasets, verifying the effectiveness and robustness of our method against potential adaptive attacks.

Title: A Human-In-The-Loop Simulation Framework for Evaluating Control Strategies in Gait Assistive Robots
Authors: Yifan Wang, Sherwin Stephen Chan, Mingyuan Lei, Lek Syn Lim, Henry Johan, Bingran Zuo, Wei Tech Ang
Abstract: As the global population ages, effective rehabilitation and mobility aids will become increasingly critical. Gait assistive robots are promising solutions, but designing adaptable controllers for various impairments poses a significant challenge. This paper presented a Human-In-The-Loop (HITL) simulation framework tailored specifically for gait assistive robots, addressing unique challenges posed by passive support systems. We incorporated a realistic physical human-robot interaction (pHRI) model to enable a quantitative evaluation of robot control strategies, highlighting the performance of a speed-adaptive controller compared to a conventional PID controller in maintaining compliance and reducing gait distortion. We assessed the accuracy of the simulated interactions against that of the real-world data and revealed discrepancies in the adaptation strategies taken by the human and their effect on the human's gait. This work underscored the potential of HITL simulation as a versatile tool for developing and fine-tuning personalized control policies for various users.

Title: Enhancing AUTOSAR-Based Firmware Over-the-Air Updates in the Automotive Industry with a Practical Implementation on a Steering System
Authors: Mostafa Ahmed Mostafa Ahmed, Mohamed Khaled Mohamed Elsayed, Radwa Waheed Ezzat Abdelmohsen
Abstract: The automotive industry is increasingly reliant on software to manage complex vehicle functionalities, making efficient and secure firmware updates essential. Traditional firmware update methods, requiring physical connections through On-Board Diagnostics (OBD) ports, are inconvenient, costly, and time-consuming. Firmware Over-the-Air (FOTA) technology offers a revolutionary solution by enabling wireless updates, reducing operational costs, and enhancing the user experience. This project aims to design and implement an advanced FOTA system tailored for modern vehicles, incorporating the AUTOSAR architecture for scalability and standardization, and utilizing delta updating to minimize firmware update sizes, thereby improving bandwidth efficiency and reducing flashing times. To ensure security, the system integrates the UDS 0x27 protocol for authentication and data integrity during the update process. Communication between Electronic Control Units (ECUs) is achieved using the CAN protocol, while the ESP8266 module and the master ECU communicate via SPI for data transfer. The system's architecture includes key components such as a bootloader, boot manager, and bootloader updater to facilitate seamless firmware updates. The functionality of the system is demonstrated through two applications: a blinking LED and a Lane Keeping Assist (LKA) system, showcasing its versatility in handling critical automotive features. This project represents a significant step forward in automotive technology, offering a user-centric, efficient, and secure solution for automotive firmware management.

Title: Decadal analysis of sea surface temperature patterns, climatology, and anomalies in temperate coastal waters with Landsat-8 TIRS observations
Authors: Yiqing Guo, Nagur Cherukuru, Eric Lehmann, Xiubin Qi, Mark Doubelld, S. L. Kesav Unnithan, Ming Feng
Abstract: Sea surface temperature (SST) is a fundamental physical parameter characterising the thermal state of sea surface. The Thermal Infrared Sensor (TIRS) onboard Landsat-8, with its 100-meter spatial resolution, offers a unique opportunity to uncover fine-scale coastal SST patterns that would otherwise be overlooked by coarser-resolution thermal sensors. In this study, we first develop an operational approach for SST retrieval from the TIRS sensor, and subsequently propose a novel algorithm for establishing daily SST climatology which serves as the baseline to detect anomalous SST events. We applied the proposed methods to temperate coastal waters in South Australia for the ten-year period from 2014 to 2023. For ground validation purposes, a buoy was deployed off the coast of Port Lincoln, South Australia, to record in-situ time-series SST. The spatiotemporal patterns of SST in the study area were analysed based on the ten years of satellite-derived SST imagery. The daily baseline climatology of SST with 100 m resolution was constructed, which allowed for the detection and analysis of anomalous SST events during the study period of 2014-2023. Our results suggest the following: (1) the satellite-derived SST data, generated with the proposed algorithm, aligned well with the in-situ measured SST values; (2) the semi-enclosed, shallow regions of Upper Spencer Gulf and Upper St Vincent Gulf showed higher temperatures during summer and cooler temperatures during winter than waters closer to the open ocean, resulting in a higher seasonal variation in SST; (3) the near-shore shallow areas in Spencer Gulf and St Vincent Gulf, and regions surrounding Kangaroo Island, were identified to have a higher probability of SST anomalies compared to the rest of the study area; and (4) anomalous SST events were more likely to happen during the warm months than the cool months.

Title: Merry-Go-Round: Safe Control of Decentralized Multi-Robot Systems with Deadlock Prevention
Authors: Wonjong Lee, Joonyeol Sim, Joonkyung Kim, Siwon Jo, Wenhao Luo, Changjoo Nam
Abstract: We propose a hybrid approach for decentralized multi-robot navigation that ensures both safety and deadlock prevention. Building on a standard control formulation, we add a lightweight deadlock prevention mechanism by forming temporary "roundabouts" (circular reference paths). Each robot relies only on local, peer-to-peer communication and a controller for base collision avoidance; a roundabout is generated or joined on demand to avert deadlocks. Robots in the roundabout travel in one direction until an escape condition is met, allowing them to return to goal-oriented motion. Unlike classical decentralized methods that lack explicit deadlock resolution, our roundabout maneuver ensures system-wide forward progress while preserving safety constraints. Extensive simulations and physical robot experiments show that our method consistently outperforms or matches the success and arrival rates of other decentralized control approaches, particularly in cluttered or high-density scenarios, all with minimal centralized coordination.

Title: Enhancing Thin-Film Wafer Inspection With A Multi-Sensor Array And Robot Constraint Maintenance
Authors: N√©stor Eduardo S√°nchez-Arriaga, Ethan Canzini, Nathan John Espley-Plumb, Michael Farnsworth, Simon Pope, Adrian Leyland, Ashutosh Tiwari
Abstract: Thin-film inspection on large-area substrates in coating manufacture remains a critical parameter to ensure product quality; however, extending the inspection process precisely over a large area presents major challenges, due to the limitations of the available inspection equipment. An additional manipulation problem arises when automating the inspection process, as the silicon wafer requires movement constraints to ensure accurate measurements and to prevent damage. Furthermore, there are other increasingly important large-area industrial applications, such as Roll-to-Roll (R2R) manufacturing where coating thickness inspection introduces additional challenges. This paper presents an autonomous inspection system using a robotic manipulator with a novel learned constraint manifold to control a wafer to its calibration point, and a novel multi-sensor array with high potential for scalability into large substrate areas. We demonstrate that the manipulator can perform required motions whilst adhering to movement constraints. We further demonstrate that the sensor array can perform thickness measurements statically with an error of $<2\%$ compared to a commercial reflectometer, and through the use of a manipulator can dynamically detect angle variations $>0.5^\circ$ from the calibration point whilst monitoring the RMSE and $R^2$ over 1406 data points. These features are potentially useful for detecting displacement variations in R2R manufacturing processes.

Title: Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion for Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua D. Reiss
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition is challenging due to the difficulty of extracting features that capture subtle emotional differences. Understanding multi-modal interactions and connections is key to building effective bimodal speech emotion recognition systems. In this work, we propose Bimodal Connection Attention Fusion (BCAF) method, which includes three main modules: the interactive connection network, the bimodal attention network, and the correlative attention network. The interactive connection network uses an encoder-decoder architecture to model modality connections between audio and text while leveraging modality-specific features. The bimodal attention network enhances semantic complementation and exploits intra- and inter-modal interactions. The correlative attention network reduces cross-modal noise and captures correlations between audio and text. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed BCAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Ergodic-Risk Constrained Policy Optimization: The Linear Quadratic Case
Authors: Shahriar Talebi, Na Li
Abstract: Risk-sensitive control balances performance with resilience to unlikely events in uncertain systems. This paper introduces ergodic-risk criteria, which capture long-term cumulative risks through probabilistic limit theorems. By ensuring the dynamics exhibit strong ergodicity, we demonstrate that the time-correlated terms in these limiting criteria converge even with potentially heavy-tailed process noises as long as the noise has a finite fourth moment. Building upon this, we proposed the ergodic-risk constrained policy optimization which incorporates an ergodic-risk constraint to the classical Linear Quadratic Regulation (LQR) framework. We then propose a primal-dual policy optimization method that optimizes the average performance while satisfying the ergodic-risk constraints. Numerical results demonstrate that the new risk-constrained LQR not only optimizes average performance but also limits the asymptotic variance associated with the ergodic-risk criterion, making the closed-loop system more robust against sporadic large fluctuations in process noise.

Title: Audio-to-Image Encoding for Improved Voice Characteristic Detection Using Deep Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Youness Atif
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel audio-to-image encoding framework that integrates multiple dimensions of voice characteristics into a single RGB image for speaker recognition. In this method, the green channel encodes raw audio data, the red channel embeds statistical descriptors of the voice signal (including key metrics such as median and mean values for fundamental frequency, spectral centroid, bandwidth, rolloff, zero-crossing rate, MFCCs, RMS energy, spectral flatness, spectral contrast, chroma, and harmonic-to-noise ratio), and the blue channel comprises subframes representing these features in a spatially organized format. A deep convolutional neural network trained on these composite images achieves 98% accuracy in speaker classification across two speakers, suggesting that this integrated multi-channel representation can provide a more discriminative input for voice recognition tasks.

Title: Training and Inference Efficiency of Encoder-Decoder Speech Models
Authors: Piotr ≈ªelasko, Kunal Dhawan, Daniel Galvez, Krishna C. Puvvada, Ankita Pasad, Nithin Rao Koluguri, Ke Hu, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Jagadeesh Balam, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Attention encoder-decoder model architecture is the backbone of several recent top performing foundation speech models: Whisper, Seamless, OWSM, and Canary-1B. However, the reported data and compute requirements for their training are prohibitive for many in the research community. In this work, we focus on the efficiency angle and ask the questions of whether we are training these speech models efficiently, and what can we do to improve? We argue that a major, if not the most severe, detrimental factor for training efficiency is related to the sampling strategy of sequential data. We show that negligence in mini-batch sampling leads to more than 50% computation being spent on padding. To that end, we study, profile, and optimize Canary-1B training to show gradual improvement in GPU utilization leading up to 5x increase in average batch sizes versus its original training settings. This in turn allows us to train an equivalent model using 4x less GPUs in the same wall time, or leverage the original resources and train it in 2x shorter wall time. Finally, we observe that the major inference bottleneck lies in the autoregressive decoder steps. We find that adjusting the model architecture to transfer model parameters from the decoder to the encoder results in a 3x inference speedup as measured by inverse real-time factor (RTFx) while preserving the accuracy and compute requirements for convergence. The training code and models will be available as open-source.

Title: Generative Multi-Agent Q-Learning for Policy Optimization: Decentralized Wireless Networks
Authors: Talha Bozkus, Urbashi Mitra
Abstract: Q-learning is a widely used reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm for optimizing wireless networks, but faces challenges with large state-spaces. Recently proposed multi-environment mixed Q-learning (MEMQ) algorithm addresses these challenges by employing multiple Q-learning algorithms across multiple synthetically generated, distinct but structurally related environments, so-called digital cousins. In this paper, we propose a novel multi-agent MEMQ (M-MEMQ) for cooperative decentralized wireless networks with multiple networked transmitters (TXs) and base stations (BSs). TXs do not have access to global information (joint state and actions). The new concept of coordinated and uncoordinated states is introduced. In uncoordinated states, TXs act independently to minimize their individual costs and update local Q-functions. In coordinated states, TXs use a Bayesian approach to estimate the joint state and update the joint Q-functions. The cost of information-sharing scales linearly with the number of TXs and is independent of the joint state-action space size. Several theoretical guarantees, including deterministic and probabilistic convergence, bounds on estimation error variance, and the probability of misdetecting the joint states, are given. Numerical simulations show that M-MEMQ outperforms several decentralized and centralized training with decentralized execution (CTDE) multi-agent RL algorithms by achieving 55% lower average policy error (APE), 35% faster convergence, 50% reduced runtime complexity, and 45% less sample complexity. Furthermore, M-MEMQ achieves comparable APE with significantly lower complexity than centralized methods. Simulations validate the theoretical analyses.

Title: Energy-Efficient Motion Planner for Legged Robots
Authors: Alexander Schperberg, Marcel Menner, Stefano Di Cairano
Abstract: We propose an online motion planner for legged robot locomotion with the primary objective of achieving energy efficiency. The conceptual idea is to leverage a placement set of footstep positions based on the robot's body position to determine when and how to execute steps. In particular, the proposed planner uses virtual placement sets beneath the hip joints of the legs and executes a step when the foot is outside of such placement set. Furthermore, we propose a parameter design framework that considers both energy-efficiency and robustness measures to optimize the gait by changing the shape of the placement set along with other parameters, such as step height and swing time, as a function of walking speed. We show that the planner produces trajectories that have a low Cost of Transport (CoT) and high robustness measure, and evaluate our approach against model-free Reinforcement Learning (RL) and motion imitation using biological dog motion priors as the reference. Overall, within low to medium velocity range, we show a 50.4% improvement in CoT and improved robustness over model-free RL, our best performing baseline. Finally, we show ability to handle slippery surfaces, gait transitions, and disturbances in simulation and hardware with the Unitree A1 robot.

Title: Biased Federated Learning under Wireless Heterogeneity
Authors: Muhammad Faraz Ul Abrar, Nicol√≤ Michelusi
Abstract: Federated learning (FL) has emerged as a promising framework for distributed learning, enabling collaborative model training without sharing private data. Existing wireless FL works primarily adopt two communication strategies: (1) over-the-air (OTA) computation, which exploits wireless signal superposition for simultaneous gradient aggregation, and (2) digital communication, which allocates orthogonal resources for gradient uploads. Prior works on both schemes typically assume \emph{homogeneous} wireless conditions (equal path loss across devices) to enforce zero-bias updates or permit uncontrolled bias, resulting in suboptimal performance and high-variance model updates in \emph{heterogeneous} environments, where devices with poor channel conditions slow down convergence. This paper addresses FL over heterogeneous wireless networks by proposing novel OTA and digital FL updates that allow a structured, time-invariant model bias, thereby reducing variance in FL updates. We analyze their convergence under a unified framework and derive an upper bound on the model ``optimality error", which explicitly quantifies the effect of bias and variance in terms of design parameters. Next, to optimize this trade-off, we study a non-convex optimization problem and develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based framework to jointly optimize the design parameters. We perform extensive numerical evaluations with several related design variants and state-of-the-art OTA and digital FL schemes. Our results confirm that minimizing the bias-variance trade-off while allowing a structured bias provides better FL convergence performance than existing schemes.

Title: Wireless Hallucination in Generative AI-enabled Communications: Concepts, Issues, and Solutions
Authors: Xudong Wang, Jiacheng Wang, Lei Feng, Dusit Niyato, Ruichen Zhang, Jiawen Kang, Zehui Xiong, Hongyang Du, Shiwen Mao
Abstract: Generative AI (GenAI) is driving the intelligence of wireless communications. Due to data limitations, random generation, and dynamic environments, GenAI may generate channel information or optimization strategies that violate physical laws or deviate from actual real-world requirements. We refer to this phenomenon as wireless hallucination, which results in invalid channel information, spectrum wastage, and low communication reliability but remains underexplored. To address this gap, this article provides a comprehensive concept of wireless hallucinations in GenAI-driven communications, focusing on hallucination mitigation. Specifically, we first introduce the fundamental, analyze its causes based on the GenAI workflow, and propose mitigation solutions at the data, model, and post-generation levels. Then, we systematically examines representative hallucination scenarios in GenAI-enabled communications and their corresponding solutions. Finally, we propose a novel integrated mitigation solution for GenAI-based channel estimation. At the data level, we establish a channel estimation hallucination dataset and employ generative adversarial networks (GANs)-based data augmentation. Additionally, we incorporate attention mechanisms and large language models (LLMs) to enhance both training and inference performance. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed hybrid solutions reduce the normalized mean square error (NMSE) by 0.19, effectively reducing wireless hallucinations.

Title: Asymmetric Modular Pulse Synthesizer: A High-Power High-Granularity Electronics Solution for Transcranial Magnetic Stimulation with Practically Any Pulse Shape for Neural Activation Selectivity
Authors: Jinshui Zhang, Angel Peterchev, Stefan Goetz
Abstract: Noninvasive brain stimulation can activate neurons in the brain but requires power electronics with exceptionally high power in the mega-volt-ampere and high frequencies in the kilohertz range. Whereas oscillator circuits offered only one or very few pulse shapes, modular power electronics solved a long-standing problem for the first time and enabled arbitrary software-based design of the temporal shape of stimuli. However, synthesizing arbitrary stimuli with a high output quality requires a large number of modules. Systems with few modules and pulse-width modulation may generate apparently smooth current shapes in the highly inductive coil, but the stimulation effect of the neurons depends on the electric field and the electric field becomes a burst of ultra-brief rectangular pulses. We propose an alternative solution that achieves high-resolution pulse shaping with fewer modules by implementing high-power wide-bandwidth voltage asymmetry. Rather than equal voltage steps, our system strategically assigns different voltages to each module to achieve a near-exponential improvement in resolution. Compared to prior designs, our experimental prototype achieved better output quality, although it uses only half the number of modules.

Title: Text-Speech Language Models with Improved Cross-Modal Transfer by Aligning Abstraction Levels
Authors: Santiago Cuervo, Adel Moumen, Yanis Labrak, Sameer Khurana, Antoine Laurent, Mickael Rouvier, Ricard Marxer
Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- aim to enable cross-modal knowledge transfer to overcome the scaling limitations of unimodal speech LMs. The predominant approach to TSLM training expands the vocabulary of a pre-trained text LM by appending new embeddings and linear projections for speech, followed by fine-tuning on speech data. We hypothesize that this method limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality, preventing text-learned functions from being fully leveraged at appropriate abstraction levels. To address this, we propose augmenting vocabulary expansion with modules that better align abstraction levels across layers. Our models, \textsc{SmolTolk}, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute. Representation analyses and improved multimodal performance suggest our method enhances cross-modal transfer.

Title: Zero-AVSR: Zero-Shot Audio-Visual Speech Recognition with LLMs by Learning Language-Agnostic Speech Representations
Authors: Jeong Hun Yeo, Minsu Kim, Chae Won Kim, Stavros Petridis, Yong Man Ro
Abstract: We explore a novel zero-shot Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) framework, dubbed Zero-AVSR, which enables speech recognition in target languages without requiring any audio-visual speech data in those languages. Specifically, we introduce the Audio-Visual Speech Romanizer (AV-Romanizer), which learns language-agnostic speech representations by predicting Roman text. Then, by leveraging the strong multilingual modeling capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs), we propose converting the predicted Roman text into language-specific graphemes, forming the proposed Cascaded Zero-AVSR. Taking it a step further, we explore a unified Zero-AVSR approach by directly integrating the audio-visual speech representations encoded by the AV-Romanizer into the LLM. This is achieved through finetuning the adapter and the LLM using our proposed multi-task learning scheme. To capture the wide spectrum of phonetic and linguistic diversity, we also introduce a Multilingual Audio-Visual Romanized Corpus (MARC) consisting of 2,916 hours of audio-visual speech data across 82 languages, along with transcriptions in both language-specific graphemes and Roman text. Extensive analysis and experiments confirm that the proposed Zero-AVSR framework has the potential to expand language support beyond the languages seen during the training of the AV-Romanizer.

Title: End-to-End Action Segmentation Transformer
Authors: Tieqiao Wang, Sinisa Todorovic
Abstract: Existing approaches to action segmentation use pre-computed frame features extracted by methods which have been trained on tasks that are different from action segmentation. Also, recent approaches typically use deep framewise representations that lack explicit modeling of action segments. To address these shortcomings, we introduce the first end-to-end solution to action segmentation -- End-to-End Action Segmentation Transformer (EAST). Our key contributions include: (1) a simple and efficient adapter design for effective backbone fine-tuning; (2) a segmentation-by-detection framework for leveraging action proposals initially predicted over a coarsely downsampled video toward labeling of all frames; and (3) a new action-proposal based data augmentation for robust training. EAST achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmarks, including GTEA, 50Salads, Breakfast, and Assembly-101. The model and corresponding code will be released.

Title: Accompaniment Prompt Adherence: A Measure for Evaluating Music Accompaniment Systems
Authors: Maarten Grachten, Javier Nistal
Abstract: Generative systems of musical accompaniments are rapidly growing, yet there are no standardized metrics to evaluate how well generations align with the conditional audio prompt. We introduce a distribution-based measure called "Accompaniment Prompt Adherence" (APA), and validate it through objective experiments on synthetic data perturbations, and human listening tests. Results show that APA aligns well with human judgments of adherence and is discriminative to transformations that degrade adherence. We release a Python implementation of the metric using the widely adopted pre-trained CLAP embedding model, offering a valuable tool for evaluating and comparing accompaniment generation systems.

Title: A Neural Score Follower for Computer Accompaniment of Polyphonic Musical Instruments
Authors: Ashwin Pillay
Abstract: Real-time computer-based accompaniment for human musical performances entails three critical tasks: identifying what the performer is playing, locating their position within the score, and synchronously playing the accompanying parts. Among these, the second task (score following) has been addressed through methods such as dynamic programming on string sequences, Hidden Markov Models (HMMs), and Online Time Warping (OLTW). Yet, the remarkably successful techniques of Deep Learning (DL) have not been directly applied to this problem. Therefore, we introduce HeurMiT, a novel DL-based score-following framework, utilizing a neural architecture designed to learn compressed latent representations that enables precise performer tracking despite deviations from the score. Parallelly, we implement a real-time MIDI data augmentation toolkit, aimed at enhancing the robustness of these learned representations. Additionally, we integrate the overall system with simple heuristic rules to create a comprehensive framework that can interface seamlessly with existing transcription and accompaniment technologies. However, thorough experimentation reveals that despite its impressive computational efficiency, HeurMiT's underlying limitations prevent it from being practical in real-world score following scenarios. Consequently, we present our work as an introductory exploration into the world of DL-based score followers, while highlighting some promising avenues to encourage future research towards robust, state-of-the-art neural score following systems.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control for Magnetic Micro-robot Navigation with Immersive Manipulation
Authors: Yudong Mao, Dandan Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic micro-robots have demonstrated immense potential in biomedical applications, such as in vivo drug delivery, non-invasive diagnostics, and cell-based therapies, owing to their precise maneuverability and small size. However, current micromanipulation techniques often rely solely on a two-dimensional (2D) microscopic view as sensory feedback, while traditional control interfaces do not provide an intuitive manner for operators to manipulate micro-robots. These limitations increase the cognitive load on operators, who must interpret limited feedback and translate it into effective control actions. To address these challenges, we propose a Deep Reinforcement Learning-Based Semi-Autonomous Control (DRL-SC) framework for magnetic micro-robot navigation in a simulated microvascular system. Our framework integrates Mixed Reality (MR) to facilitate immersive manipulation of micro-robots, thereby enhancing situational awareness and control precision. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves navigation efficiency, reduces control errors, and enhances the overall robustness of the system in simulated microvascular environments.

Title: Adaptive Audio-Visual Speech Recognition via Matryoshka-Based Multimodal LLMs
Authors: Umberto Cappellazzo, Minsu Kim, Stavros Petridis
Abstract: Audio-Visual Speech Recognition (AVSR) leverages both audio and visual modalities to enhance speech recognition robustness, particularly in noisy environments. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated their effectiveness in speech recognition, including AVSR. However, due to the significant length of speech representations, direct integration with LLMs imposes substantial computational costs. Prior approaches address this by compressing speech representations before feeding them into LLMs. However, higher compression ratios often lead to performance degradation, necessitating a trade-off between computational efficiency and recognition accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose Llama-MTSK, the first Matryoshka-based Multimodal LLM for AVSR, which enables flexible adaptation of the audio-visual token allocation based on specific computational constraints while preserving high performance. Our approach, inspired by Matryoshka Representation Learning, encodes audio-visual representations at multiple granularities within a single model, eliminating the need to train separate models for different compression levels. Moreover, to efficiently fine-tune the LLM, we introduce three LoRA-based Matryoshka strategies using global and scale-specific LoRA modules. Extensive evaluations on the two largest AVSR datasets demonstrate that Llama-MTSK achieves state-of-the-art results, matching or surpassing models trained independently at fixed compression levels.

Title: Heterogeneous bimodal attention fusion for speech emotion recognition
Authors: Jiachen Luo, Huy Phan, Lin Wang, Joshua Reiss
Abstract: Multi-modal emotion recognition in conversations is a challenging problem due to the complex and complementary interactions between different modalities. Audio and textual cues are particularly important for understanding emotions from a human perspective. Most existing studies focus on exploring interactions between audio and text modalities at the same representation level. However, a critical issue is often overlooked: the heterogeneous modality gap between low-level audio representations and high-level text representations. To address this problem, we propose a novel framework called Heterogeneous Bimodal Attention Fusion (HBAF) for multi-level multi-modal interaction in conversational emotion recognition. The proposed method comprises three key modules: the uni-modal representation module, the multi-modal fusion module, and the inter-modal contrastive learning module. The uni-modal representation module incorporates contextual content into low-level audio representations to bridge the heterogeneous multi-modal gap, enabling more effective fusion. The multi-modal fusion module uses dynamic bimodal attention and a dynamic gating mechanism to filter incorrect cross-modal relationships and fully exploit both intra-modal and inter-modal interactions. Finally, the inter-modal contrastive learning module captures complex absolute and relative interactions between audio and text modalities. Experiments on the MELD and IEMOCAP datasets demonstrate that the proposed HBAF method outperforms existing state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: Vision-Based Cooperative MAV-Capturing-MAV
Authors: Canlun Zheng, Yize Mi, Hanqing Guo, Huaben Chen, Shiyu Zhao
Abstract: MAV-capturing-MAV (MCM) is one of the few effective methods for physically countering misused or malicious this http URL paper presents a vision-based cooperative MCM system, where multiple pursuer MAVs equipped with onboard vision systems detect, localize, and pursue a target MAV. To enhance robustness, a distributed state estimation and control framework enables the pursuer MAVs to autonomously coordinate their actions. Pursuer trajectories are optimized using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and executed via a low-level SO(3) controller, ensuring smooth and stable pursuit. Once the capture conditions are satisfied, the pursuer MAVs automatically deploy a flying net to intercept the target. These capture conditions are determined based on the predicted motion of the net. To enable real-time decision-making, we propose a lightweight computational method to approximate the net motion, avoiding the prohibitive cost of solving the full net dynamics. The effectiveness of the proposed system is validated through simulations and real-world experiments. In real-world tests, our approach successfully captures a moving target traveling at 4 meters per second with an acceleration of 1 meter per square second, achieving a success rate of 64.7 percent.

Title: Explaining Control Policies through Predicate Decision Diagrams
Authors: Debraj Chakraborty, Clemens Dubslaff, Sudeep Kanav, Jan Kretinsky, Christoph Weinhuber
Abstract: Safety-critical controllers of complex systems are hard to construct manually. Automated approaches such as controller synthesis or learning provide a tempting alternative but usually lack explainability. To this end, learning decision trees (DTs) have been prevalently used towards an interpretable model of the generated controllers. However, DTs do not exploit shared decision-making, a key concept exploited in binary decision diagrams (BDDs) to reduce their size and thus improve explainability. In this work, we introduce predicate decision diagrams (PDDs) that extend BDDs with predicates and thus unite the advantages of DTs and BDDs for controller representation. We establish a synthesis pipeline for efficient construction of PDDs from DTs representing controllers, exploiting reduction techniques for BDDs also for PDDs.

Title: Generalizable Machine Learning Models for Predicting Data Center Server Power, Efficiency, and Throughput
Authors: Nuoa Lei, Arman Shehabi, Jun Lu, Zhi Cao, Jonathan Koomey, Sarah Smith, Eric Masanet
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving digital era, comprehending the intricate dynamics influencing server power consumption, efficiency, and performance is crucial for sustainable data center operations. However, existing models lack the ability to provide a detailed and reliable understanding of these intricate relationships. This study employs a machine learning-based approach, using the SPECPower_ssj2008 database, to facilitate user-friendly and generalizable server modeling. The resulting models demonstrate high accuracy, with errors falling within approximately 10% on the testing dataset, showcasing their practical utility and generalizability. Through meticulous analysis, predictive features related to hardware availability date, server workload level, and specifications are identified, providing insights into optimizing energy conservation, efficiency, and performance in server deployment and operation. By systematically measuring biases and uncertainties, the study underscores the need for caution when employing historical data for prospective server modeling, considering the dynamic nature of technology landscapes. Collectively, this work offers valuable insights into the sustainable deployment and operation of servers in data centers, paving the way for enhanced resource use efficiency and more environmentally conscious practices.

Title: Reconstructing Depth Images of Moving Objects from Wi-Fi CSI Data
Authors: Guanyu Cao, Takuya Maekawa, Kazuya Ohara, Yasue Kishino
Abstract: This study proposes a new deep learning method for reconstructing depth images of moving objects within a specific area using Wi-Fi channel state information (CSI). The Wi-Fi-based depth imaging technique has novel applications in domains such as security and elder care. However, reconstructing depth images from CSI is challenging because learning the mapping function between CSI and depth images, both of which are high-dimensional data, is particularly difficult. To address the challenge, we propose a new approach called Wi-Depth. The main idea behind the design of Wi-Depth is that a depth image of a moving object can be decomposed into three core components: the shape, depth, and position of the target. Therefore, in the depth-image reconstruction task, Wi-Depth simultaneously estimates the three core pieces of information as auxiliary tasks in our proposed VAE-based teacher-student architecture, enabling it to output images with the consistency of a correct shape, depth, and position. In addition, the design of Wi-Depth is based on our idea that this decomposition efficiently takes advantage of the fact that shape, depth, and position relate to primitive information inferred from CSI such as angle-of-arrival, time-of-flight, and Doppler frequency shift.

Title: Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic Butterfly
Authors: Xuyi Lian, Mingyu Luo, Te Lin, Chen Qian, Tiefeng Li
Abstract: Abdominal Undulation with Compliant Mechanism Improves Flight Performance of Biomimetic Robotic ButterflThis paper presents the design, modeling, and experimental validation of a biomimetic robotic butterfly (BRB) that integrates a compliant mechanism to achieve coupled wing-abdomen motion. Drawing inspiration from the natural f light dynamics of butterflies, a theoretical model is developed to investigate the impact of abdominal undulation on flight performance. To validate the model, motion capture experi ments are conducted on three configurations: a BRB without an abdomen, with a fixed abdomen, and with an undulating abdomen. The results demonstrate that abdominal undulation enhances lift generation, extends flight duration, and stabilizes pitch oscillations, thereby improving overall flight performance. These findings underscore the significance of wing-abdomen interaction in flapping-wing aerial vehicles (FWAVs) and lay the groundwork for future advancements in energy-efficient biomimetic flight designs.

Title: Efficient Robust Adaptive Beamforming Based on Spatial Sampling with Virtual Sensors
Authors: S. Mohammedzadeh, R. de Lamare
Abstract: Robust adaptive beamforming (RAB) based on interference-plus-noise covariance (IPNC) matrix reconstruction can experience serious performance degradation in the presence of look direction and array geometry mismatches, particularly when the input signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) is large. In this work, we present a RAB technique to address covariance matrix reconstruction problems. The proposed method involves IPNC matrix reconstruction using a low-complexity spatial sampling process (LCSSP) and employs a virtual received array vector. In particular, we devise a power spectrum sampling strategy based on a projection matrix computed in a higher dimension. A key feature of the proposed LCSSP technique is to avoid reconstruction of the IPNC matrix by integrating over the angular sector of the interference-plus-noise region. Simulation results are shown and discussed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed LCSSP method against existing approaches.

Title: Non-Equilibrium MAV-Capture-MAV via Time-Optimal Planning and Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Canlun Zheng, Zhanyu Guo, Zikang Yin, Chunyu Wang, Zhikun Wang, Shiyu Zhao
Abstract: The capture of flying MAVs (micro aerial vehicles) has garnered increasing research attention due to its intriguing challenges and promising applications. Despite recent advancements, a key limitation of existing work is that capture strategies are often relatively simple and constrained by platform performance. This paper addresses control strategies capable of capturing high-maneuverability targets. The unique challenge of achieving target capture under unstable conditions distinguishes this task from traditional pursuit-evasion and guidance problems. In this study, we transition from larger MAV platforms to a specially designed, compact capture MAV equipped with a custom launching device while maintaining high maneuverability. We explore both time-optimal planning (TOP) and reinforcement learning (RL) methods. Simulations demonstrate that TOP offers highly maneuverable and shorter trajectories, while RL excels in real-time adaptability and stability. Moreover, the RL method has been tested in real-world scenarios, successfully achieving target capture even in unstable states.

Title: Inverse Reinforcement Learning for Minimum-Exposure Paths in Spatiotemporally Varying Scalar Fields
Authors: Alexandra E. Ballentine, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi
Abstract: Performance and reliability analyses of autonomous vehicles (AVs) can benefit from tools that ``amplify'' small datasets to synthesize larger volumes of plausible samples of the AV's behavior. We consider a specific instance of this data synthesis problem that addresses minimizing the AV's exposure to adverse environmental conditions during travel to a fixed goal location. The environment is characterized by a threat field, which is a strictly positive scalar field with higher intensities corresponding to hazardous and unfavorable conditions for the AV. We address the problem of synthesizing datasets of minimum exposure paths that resemble a training dataset of such paths. The main contribution of this paper is an inverse reinforcement learning (IRL) model to solve this problem. We consider time-invariant (static) as well as time-varying (dynamic) threat fields. We find that the proposed IRL model provides excellent performance in synthesizing paths from initial conditions not seen in the training dataset, when the threat field is the same as that used for training. Furthermore, we evaluate model performance on unseen threat fields and find low error in that case as well. Finally, we demonstrate the model's ability to synthesize distinct datasets when trained on different datasets with distinct characteristics.

Title: Synthetic Data Generation for Minimum-Exposure Navigation in a Time-Varying Environment using Generative AI Models
Authors: Nachiket U. Bapat, Randy C. Paffenroth, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi
Abstract: We study the problem of synthetic generation of samples of environmental features for autonomous vehicle navigation. These features are described by a spatiotemporally varying scalar field that we refer to as a threat field. The threat field is known to have some underlying dynamics subject to process noise. Some "real-world" data of observations of various threat fields are also available. The assumption is that the volume of ``real-world'' data is relatively small. The objective is to synthesize samples that are statistically similar to the data. The proposed solution is a generative artificial intelligence model that we refer to as a split variational recurrent neural network (S-VRNN). The S-VRNN merges the capabilities of a variational autoencoder, which is a widely used generative model, and a recurrent neural network, which is used to learn temporal dependencies in data. The main innovation in this work is that we split the latent space of the S-VRNN into two subspaces. The latent variables in one subspace are learned using the ``real-world'' data, whereas those in the other subspace are learned using the data as well as the known underlying system dynamics. Through numerical experiments we demonstrate that the proposed S-VRNN can synthesize data that are statistically similar to the training data even in the case of very small volume of ``real-world'' training data.

Title: Hardware-Accelerated Event-Graph Neural Networks for Low-Latency Time-Series Classification on SoC FPGA
Authors: Hiroshi Nakano, Krzysztof Blachut, Kamil Jeziorek, Piotr Wzorek, Manon Dampfhoffer, Thomas Mesquida, Hiroaki Nishi, Tomasz Kryjak, Thomas Dalgaty
Abstract: As the quantities of data recorded by embedded edge sensors grow, so too does the need for intelligent local processing. Such data often comes in the form of time-series signals, based on which real-time predictions can be made locally using an AI model. However, a hardware-software approach capable of making low-latency predictions with low power consumption is required. In this paper, we present a hardware implementation of an event-graph neural network for time-series classification. We leverage an artificial cochlea model to convert the input time-series signals into a sparse event-data format that allows the event-graph to drastically reduce the number of calculations relative to other AI methods. We implemented the design on a SoC FPGA and applied it to the real-time processing of the Spiking Heidelberg Digits (SHD) dataset to benchmark our approach against competitive solutions. Our method achieves a floating-point accuracy of 92.7% on the SHD dataset for the base model, which is only 2.4% and 2% less than the state-of-the-art models with over 10% and 67% fewer model parameters, respectively. It also outperforms FPGA-based spiking neural network implementations by 19.3% and 4.5%, achieving 92.3% accuracy for the quantised model while using fewer computational resources and reducing latency.

Title: Electromagnetic Information Theory: Fundamentals, Paradigm Shifts, and Applications
Authors: Tengjiao Wang, Zhenyu Kang, Ting Li, Zhihui Chen, Shaobo Wang, Yingpei Lin, Yan Wang, Yichuan Yu
Abstract: This paper explores the emerging research direction of electromagnetic information theory (EIT), which aims to integrate traditional Shannon-based methodologies with physical consistency, particularly the electromagnetic properties of communication channels. We propose an EIT-based multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) paradigm that enhances conventional spatially-discrete MIMO models by incorporating the concepts of electromagnetic (EM) precoding and EM combining. This approach aims to improve the modeling of next-generation systems while remaining consistent with Shannon's theoretical foundations. We explore typical EIT applications, such as densely spaced MIMO, near-field communications, and tri-polarized antennas, and analyze their channel characteristics through theoretical simulations and measured datasets. The paper also discusses critical research challenges and opportunities for EIT applications from an industrial perspective, emphasizing the field's potential for practical applications.

Title: Low contrast detection and super-resolution in CT images: evaluation of a novel approach based on Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation
Authors: Lorenzo Lasagni
Abstract: In this work, image analysis techniques used in astrophysics to detect low-contrast signals have been adapted in the processing of Computed Tomography (CT) images, combining Centroidal Voronoi Tessellation (CVT) and machine learning techniques. Several CT acquisitions were performed using a phantom containing cylindrical inserts of different diameters producing objects with different contrasts respect to background. The images of the phantom, tilted by a known angle with respect to the tomograph axis (to mimic the casual orientation of a clinical lesion), were acquired at various radiation doses (CTDIvol) and at different slice's thicknesses. The success in detecting the signal in the single image (slice) was always greater than 60%. The axis of each insert has always been correctly identified. A super-resolution 2D image was then generated by projecting the individual slices of the scan along this axis, thus increasing the CNR of the object scanned as a whole. CVT holds great promise for future use in medical imaging, for the identification of low-contrast lesions in homogeneous organs, such as the liver.

Title: Seeing Delta Parameters as JPEG Images: Data-Free Delta Compression with Discrete Cosine Transform
Authors: Chenyu Huang, Peng Ye, Xiaohui Wang, Shenghe Zheng, Biqing Qi, Lei Bai, Wanli Ouyang, Tao Chen
Abstract: With transformer-based models and the pretrain-finetune paradigm becoming mainstream, the high storage and deployment costs of individual finetuned models on multiple tasks pose critical challenges. Delta compression attempts to lower the costs by reducing the redundancy of delta parameters (i.e., the difference between the finetuned and pre-trained model weights). However, existing methods usually face problems including data accessibility and training requirements. To tackle this issue, we introduce Delta-DCT, the first data-free delta compression method inspired by classic JPEG image compression, leveraging the Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT). We first (a) group delta parameters within a layer into patches. Then we (b) assess the importance of each patch and allocate them with different quantization bit-widths. Afterwards, we (c) convert these patches to the DCT domain and conduct quantization to each patch based on the allocated bit-width. The proposed Delta-DCT does not require any training or data calibration, while achieving performance comparable to or even surpassing original finetuned models under 1-bit equivalent delta compression ratios on different kinds of models including: (1) recently-released LLMs of different sizes from 7B to 13B, (2) relatively smaller language models including RoBERTa and T5 models, (3) variants of vision transformer models, and (4) multi-modal BEiT-3 models.

Title: Unsupervised Multi-Clustering and Decision-Making Strategies for 4D-STEM Orientation Mapping
Authors: Junhao Cao, Nicolas Folastre, Gozde Oney, Edgar Rauch, Stavros Nicolopoulos, Partha Pratim Das, Arnaud Demorti√®re
Abstract: This study presents a novel integration of unsupervised learning and decision-making strategies for the advanced analysis of 4D-STEM datasets, with a focus on non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) as the primary clustering method. Our approach introduces a systematic framework to determine the optimal number of components (k) required for robust and interpretable orientation mapping. By leveraging the K-Component Loss method and Image Quality Assessment (IQA) metrics, we effectively balance reconstruction fidelity and model complexity. Additionally, we highlight the critical role of dataset preprocessing in improving clustering stability and accuracy. Furthermore, our spatial weight matrix analysis provides insights into overlapping regions within the dataset by employing threshold-based visualization, facilitating a detailed understanding of cluster interactions. The results demonstrate the potential of combining NMF with advanced IQA metrics and preprocessing techniques for reliable orientation mapping and structural analysis in 4D-STEM datasets, paving the way for future applications in multi-dimensional material characterization.

Title: Scalable Integrated Sensing and Communications for Multi-Target Detection and Tracking in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: A Unified Framework
Authors: Sergi Liesegang, Stefano Buzzi, Carmen D'Andrea
Abstract: This paper investigates a cell-free massive MIMO (multiple-input multiple-output) system where distributed access points (APs) perform integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) tasks, enabling simultaneous user communication and target detection/tracking. A unified framework and signal model are developed for the detection of potential targets and tracking of previously detected ones, even in arbitrary positions. Leveraging the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test technique, novel detection/tracking algorithms are proposed to handle unknown target responses and interference. Scalable AP-user and AP-target association rules are evaluated, explicitly considering multi-zone sensing scenarios. Additionally, a scalable power control mechanism extends fractional power control principles to ISAC, balancing power allocation between communication and sensing tasks. For benchmarking, a non-scalable power control optimization problem is also formulated to maximize the minimum user data rate while ensuring a Quality of Service constraint for sensing, solved via successive convex approximation. Extensive numerical results validate the proposed framework, demonstrating its effectiveness in both communication and sensing, revealing the impact of interference from other targets, and highlighting fundamental trade-offs between sensing and communication performance.

Title: Chance-constrained Linear Quadratic Gaussian Games for Multi-robot Interaction under Uncertainty
Authors: Kai Ren, Giulio Salizzoni, Mustafa Emre G√ºrsoy, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We address safe multi-robot interaction under uncertainty. In particular, we formulate a chance-constrained linear quadratic Gaussian game with coupling constraints and system uncertainties. We find a tractable reformulation of the game and propose a dual ascent algorithm. We prove that the algorithm converges to a generalized Nash equilibrium of the reformulated game, ensuring the satisfaction of the chance constraints. We test our method in driving simulations and real-world robot experiments. Our method ensures safety under uncertainty and generates less conservative trajectories than single-agent model predictive control.

Title: Chance-Constrained Trajectory Planning with Multimodal Environmental Uncertainty
Authors: Kai Ren, Heejin Ahn, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We tackle safe trajectory planning under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we use a GMM to model the multimodal behaviors of obstacles' uncertain states. Then, we develop a mixed-integer conic approximation to the chance-constrained trajectory planning problem with deterministic linear systems and polyhedral obstacles. When the GMM moments are estimated via finite samples, we develop a tight concentration bound to ensure the chance constraint with a desired confidence. Moreover, to limit the amount of constraint violation, we develop a Conditional Value-at-Risk (CVaR) approach corresponding to the chance constraints and derive a tractable approximation for known and estimated GMM moments. We verify our methods with state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms and autonomous driving datasets.

Title: GenDR: Lightning Generative Detail Restorator
Authors: Yan Wang, Shijie Zhao, Kai Chen, Kexin Zhang, Junlin Li, Li Zhang
Abstract: Recent research applying text-to-image (T2I) diffusion models to real-world super-resolution (SR) has achieved remarkable success. However, fundamental misalignments between T2I and SR targets result in a dilemma between inference speed and detail fidelity. Specifically, T2I tasks prioritize multi-step inversion to synthesize coherent outputs aligned with textual prompts and shrink the latent space to reduce generating complexity. Contrariwise, SR tasks preserve most information from low-resolution input while solely restoring high-frequency details, thus necessitating sufficient latent space and fewer inference steps. To bridge the gap, we present a one-step diffusion model for generative detail restoration, GenDR, distilled from a tailored diffusion model with larger latent space. In detail, we train a new SD2.1-VAE16 (0.9B) via representation alignment to expand latent space without enlarging the model size. Regarding step-distillation, we propose consistent score identity distillation (CiD) that incorporates SR task-specific loss into score distillation to leverage more SR priors and align the training target. Furthermore, we extend CiD with adversarial learning and representation alignment (CiDA) to enhance perceptual quality and accelerate training. We also polish the pipeline to achieve a more efficient inference. Experimental results demonstrate that GenDR achieves state-of-the-art performance in both quantitative metrics and visual fidelity.

Title: Multimodal Emotion Recognition and Sentiment Analysis in Multi-Party Conversation Contexts
Authors: Aref Farhadipour, Hossein Ranjbar, Masoumeh Chapariniya, Teodora Vukovic, Sarah Ebling, Volker Dellwo
Abstract: Emotion recognition and sentiment analysis are pivotal tasks in speech and language processing, particularly in real-world scenarios involving multi-party, conversational data. This paper presents a multimodal approach to tackle these challenges on a well-known dataset. We propose a system that integrates four key modalities/channels using pre-trained models: RoBERTa for text, Wav2Vec2 for speech, a proposed FacialNet for facial expressions, and a CNN+Transformer architecture trained from scratch for video analysis. Feature embeddings from each modality are concatenated to form a multimodal vector, which is then used to predict emotion and sentiment labels. The multimodal system demonstrates superior performance compared to unimodal approaches, achieving an accuracy of 66.36% for emotion recognition and 72.15% for sentiment analysis.

Title: HierDAMap: Towards Universal Domain Adaptive BEV Mapping via Hierarchical Perspective Priors
Authors: Siyu Li, Yihong Cao, Hao Shi, Yongsheng Zang, Xuan He, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: The exploration of Bird's-Eye View (BEV) mapping technology has driven significant innovation in visual perception technology for autonomous driving. BEV mapping models need to be applied to the unlabeled real world, making the study of unsupervised domain adaptation models an essential path. However, research on unsupervised domain adaptation for BEV mapping remains limited and cannot perfectly accommodate all BEV mapping tasks. To address this gap, this paper proposes HierDAMap, a universal and holistic BEV domain adaptation framework with hierarchical perspective priors. Unlike existing research that solely focuses on image-level learning using prior knowledge, this paper explores the guiding role of perspective prior knowledge across three distinct levels: global, sparse, and instance levels. With these priors, HierDA consists of three essential components, including Semantic-Guided Pseudo Supervision (SGPS), Dynamic-Aware Coherence Learning (DACL), and Cross-Domain Frustum Mixing (CDFM). SGPS constrains the cross-domain consistency of perspective feature distribution through pseudo labels generated by vision foundation models in 2D space. To mitigate feature distribution discrepancies caused by spatial variations, DACL employs uncertainty-aware predicted depth as an intermediary to derive dynamic BEV labels from perspective pseudo-labels, thereby constraining the coarse BEV features derived from corresponding perspective features. CDFM, on the other hand, leverages perspective masks of view frustum to mix multi-view perspective images from both domains, which guides cross-domain view transformation and encoding learning through mixed BEV labels. The proposed method is verified on multiple BEV mapping tasks, such as BEV semantic segmentation, high-definition semantic, and vectorized mapping. The source code will be made publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Automatic Speech Recognition for Non-Native English: Accuracy and Disfluency Handling
Authors: Michael McGuire
Abstract: Automatic speech recognition (ASR) has been an essential component of computer assisted language learning (CALL) and computer assisted language testing (CALT) for many years. As this technology continues to develop rapidly, it is important to evaluate the accuracy of current ASR systems for language learning applications. This study assesses five cutting-edge ASR systems' recognition of non-native accented English speech using recordings from the L2-ARCTIC corpus, featuring speakers from six different L1 backgrounds (Arabic, Chinese, Hindi, Korean, Spanish, and Vietnamese), in the form of both read and spontaneous speech. The read speech consisted of 2,400 single sentence recordings from 24 speakers, while the spontaneous speech included narrative recordings from 22 speakers. Results showed that for read speech, Whisper and AssemblyAI achieved the best accuracy with mean Match Error Rates (MER) of 0.054 and 0.056 respectively, approaching human-level accuracy. For spontaneous speech, RevAI performed best with a mean MER of 0.063. The study also examined how each system handled disfluencies such as filler words, repetitions, and revisions, finding significant variation in performance across systems and disfluency types. While processing speed varied considerably between systems, longer processing times did not necessarily correlate with better accuracy. By detailing the performance of several of the most recent, widely-available ASR systems on non-native English speech, this study aims to help language instructors and researchers understand the strengths and weaknesses of each system and identify which may be suitable for specific use cases.

Title: Weighted Codebook Scheme for RIS-Assisted Point-to-Point MIMO Communications
Authors: Zhiheng Yu, Jiancheng An, Lu Gan, Hongbin Li, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) can reshape the characteristics of wireless channels by intelligently regulating the phase shifts of reflecting elements. Recently, various codebook schemes have been utilized to optimize the reflection coefficients (RCs); however, the selection of the optimal codeword is usually obtained by evaluating a metric of interest. In this letter, we propose a novel weighted design on the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebook to obtain the optimal RCs for RIS-assisted point-to-point multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Specifically, we first introduce a channel training protocol where we configure the RIS RCs using the DFT codebook to obtain a set of observations through the uplink training process. Secondly, based on these observed samples, the Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to optimize the weights in an iterative manner, which could result in a higher channel capacity for assisting in the downlink data transmission. Thirdly, we investigate the effect of different codeword configuration orders on system performance and design an efficient codeword configuration method based on statistical channel state information (CSI). Finally, numerical simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed scheme.

Title: Synchronized Video-to-Audio Generation via Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition
Authors: Juncheng Wang, Chao Xu, Cheng Yu, Lei Shang, Zhe Hu, Shujun Wang, Liefeng Bo
Abstract: Video-to-audio generation is essential for synthesizing realistic audio tracks that synchronize effectively with silent videos. Following the perspective of extracting essential signals from videos that can precisely control the mature text-to-audio generative diffusion models, this paper presents how to balance the representation of mel-spectrograms in terms of completeness and complexity through a new approach called Mel Quantization-Continuum Decomposition (Mel-QCD). We decompose the mel-spectrogram into three distinct types of signals, employing quantization or continuity to them, we can effectively predict them from video by a devised video-to-all (V2X) predictor. Then, the predicted signals are recomposed and fed into a ControlNet, along with a textual inversion design, to control the audio generation process. Our proposed Mel-QCD method demonstrates state-of-the-art performance across eight metrics, evaluating dimensions such as quality, synchronization, and semantic consistency. Our codes and demos will be released at \href{Website}{this https URL}.

Title: Sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to time-varying parameters
Authors: Marta Zagorowska, Lars Imsland
Abstract: Online Feedback Optimization uses optimization algorithms as dynamic systems to design optimal control inputs. The results obtained from Online Feedback Optimization depend on the setup of the chosen optimization algorithm. In this work we analyse the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the parameters of projected gradient descent as the algorithm of choice. We derive closed-form expressions for sensitivities of the objective function with respect to the parameters of the projected gradient and to time-varying model mismatch. The formulas are then used for analysis of model mismatch in a gas lift optimization problem. The results of the case study indicate that the sensitivity of Online Feedback Optimization to the model mismatch depends on how long the controller has been running, with decreasing sensitivity to mismatch in individual timesteps for long operation times.

Title: Linguistic Knowledge Transfer Learning for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Kuo-Hsuan Hung, Xugang Lu, Szu-Wei Fu, Huan-Hsin Tseng, Hsin-Yi Lin, Chii-Wann Lin, Yu Tsao
Abstract: Linguistic knowledge plays a crucial role in spoken language comprehension. It provides essential semantic and syntactic context for speech perception in noisy environments. However, most speech enhancement (SE) methods predominantly rely on acoustic features to learn the mapping relationship between noisy and clean speech, with limited exploration of linguistic integration. While text-informed SE approaches have been investigated, they often require explicit speech-text alignment or externally provided textual data, constraining their practicality in real-world scenarios. Additionally, using text as input poses challenges in aligning linguistic and acoustic representations due to their inherent differences. In this study, we propose the Cross-Modality Knowledge Transfer (CMKT) learning framework, which leverages pre-trained large language models (LLMs) to infuse linguistic knowledge into SE models without requiring text input or LLMs during inference. Furthermore, we introduce a misalignment strategy to improve knowledge transfer. This strategy applies controlled temporal shifts, encouraging the model to learn more robust representations. Experimental evaluations demonstrate that CMKT consistently outperforms baseline models across various SE architectures and LLM embeddings, highlighting its adaptability to different configurations. Additionally, results on Mandarin and English datasets confirm its effectiveness across diverse linguistic conditions, further validating its robustness. Moreover, CMKT remains effective even in scenarios without textual data, underscoring its practicality for real-world applications. By bridging the gap between linguistic and acoustic modalities, CMKT offers a scalable and innovative solution for integrating linguistic knowledge into SE models, leading to substantial improvements in both intelligibility and enhancement performance.

Title: Symplectic Optimization for Cross Subcarrier Precoder Design with Channel Smoothing in Massive MIMO-OFDM System
Authors: Yuxuan Zhang, An-An Lu, Xiqi Gao
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a cross subcarrier precoder design (CSPD) for massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) systems. The aim is to maximize the weighted sum-rate (WSR) performance while considering the smoothness of the frequency domain effective channel. To quantify the smoothness of the effective channel, we introduce a delay indicator function to measure the large delay components of the effective channel. An optimization problem is then formulated to balance the WSR performance and the delay indicator function. By appropriately selecting the weight factors in the objective function and the parameters in the delay indicator function, the delay spread of the effective channel can be reduced, thereby enhancing the smoothness of the effective channel. To solve the optimization problem, we apply the symplectic optimization, which achieves faster convergence compared to the gradient descent methods. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm achieves satisfying WSR performance while maintaining the smoothness of the effective channel.

Title: Power Allocation for Coordinated Multi-Point Aided ISAC Systems
Authors: Jianpeng Zou, Zhanfeng Zhong, Jintao Wang, Zheng Shi, Guanghua Yang, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate a coordinated multiple point (CoMP)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system that supports multiple users and targets. Multiple base stations (BSs) employ a coordinated power allocation strategy to serve their associated single-antenna communication users (CUs) while utilizing the echo signals for joint radar target (RT) detection. The probability of detection (PoD) of the CoMP-ISAC system is then proposed for assessing the sensing performance. To maximize the sum rate while ensuring the PoD for each RT and adhering to the total transmit power budget across all BSs, we introduce an efficient power allocation strategy. Finally, simulation results are provided to validate the analytical findings, demonstrating that the proposed power allocation scheme effectively enhances the sum rate while satisfying the sensing requirements.

Title: Hierarchical Neuro-Symbolic Decision Transformer
Authors: Ali Baheri, Cecilia O. Alm
Abstract: We present a hierarchical neuro-symbolic control framework that couples classical symbolic planning with transformer-based policies to address complex, long-horizon decision-making tasks. At the high level, a symbolic planner constructs an interpretable sequence of operators based on logical propositions, ensuring systematic adherence to global constraints and goals. At the low level, each symbolic operator is translated into a sub-goal token that conditions a decision transformer to generate a fine-grained sequence of actions in uncertain, high-dimensional environments. We provide theoretical analysis showing how approximation errors from both the symbolic planner and the neural execution layer accumulate. Empirical evaluations in grid-worlds with multiple keys, locked doors, and item-collection tasks show that our hierarchical approach outperforms purely end-to-end neural approach in success rates and policy efficiency.

Authors: Gianni Bianchini, Marco Casini, Milad Gholami
Abstract: Within the context of renewable energy communities, this paper focuses on optimal operation of producers equipped with energy storage systems in the presence of demand response. A novel strategy for optimal scheduling of the storage systems of the community members under price-volume demand response programs, is devised. The underlying optimization problem is designed as a low-complexity mixed-integer linear program that scales well with the community size. Once the optimal solution is found, an algorithm for distributing the demand response rewards is introduced in order to guarantee fairness among participants. The proposed approach ensures increased benefits for producers joining a community compared to standalone operation.

Title: Beamforming Design for Beyond Diagonal RIS-Aided Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Yizhuo Li, Jiakang Zheng, Bokai Xu, Yiyang Zhu, Jiayi Zhang, Bo Ai
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided cell-free (CF) massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) is a promising architecture for further improving spectral efficiency (SE) with low cost and power consumption. However, conventional RIS has inevitable limitations due to its capability of only reflecting signals. In contrast, beyond-diagonal RIS (BD-RIS), with its ability to both reflect and transmit signals, has gained great attention. This correspondence focuses on using BD-RIS to improve the sum SE of CF mMIMO systems. This requires completing the beamforming design under the transmit power constraints and unitary constraints of the BD-RIS, by optimizing active and passive beamformer simultaneously. To tackle this issue, we introduce an alternating optimization algorithm that decomposes it using fractional programming and solves the subproblems alternatively. Moreover, to address the challenge introduced by the unitary constraint on the beamforming matrix of the BD-RIS, a manifold optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the problem optimally. Simulation results show that BD-RISs outperform RISs comprehensively, especially in the case of the full connected architecture which achieves the best performance, enhancing the sum SE by around 40% compared to ideal RISs.

Title: A Deep Learning Architecture for Land Cover Mapping Using Spatio-Temporal Sentinel-1 Features
Authors: Luigi Russo, Antonietta Sorriso, Silvia Liberata Ullo, Paolo Gamba
Abstract: Land Cover (LC) mapping using satellite imagery is critical for environmental monitoring and management. Deep Learning (DL), particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Vision Transformers (ViTs), have revolutionized this field by enhancing the accuracy of classification tasks. In this work, a novel approach combining a transformer-based Swin-Unet architecture with seasonal synthesized spatio-temporal images has been employed to classify LC types using spatio-temporal features extracted from Sentinel-1 (S1) Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, organized into seasonal clusters. The study focuses on three distinct regions - Amazonia, Africa, and Siberia - and evaluates the model performance across diverse ecoregions within these areas. By utilizing seasonal feature sequences instead of dense temporal sequences, notable performance improvements have been achieved, especially in regions with temporal data gaps like Siberia, where S1 data distribution is uneven and non-uniform. The results demonstrate the effectiveness and the generalization capabilities of the proposed methodology in achieving high overall accuracy (O.A.) values, even in regions with limited training data.

Title: Virtual VNA 3.0: Unambiguous Scattering Matrix Estimation for Non-Reciprocal Systems by Leveraging Tunable and Coupled Loads
Authors: Philipp del Hougne
Abstract: We present the "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique for estimating the scattering matrix of a \textit{non-reciprocal}, linear, passive, time-invariant device under test (DUT) with $N$ monomodal ports using a single measurement setup involving a vector network analyzer (VNA) with only $N_\mathrm{A}<N$ ports -- thus eliminating the need for any reconnections. We partition the DUT ports into $N_\mathrm{A}$ "accessible" and $N_\mathrm{S}$ "not-directly-accessible" (NDA) ports. We connect the accessible ports to the VNA and the NDA ports to the "virtual VNA ports" of a VNA Extension Kit. This kit enables each NDA port to be terminated with three distinct individual loads or connected to neighboring DUT ports via coupled loads. We derive both a closed-form and a gradient-descent method to estimate the complete scattering matrix of the non-reciprocal DUT from measurements conducted with the $N_\mathrm{A}$-port VNA under various NDA-port terminations. We validate both methods experimentally for $N_\mathrm{A}=N_\mathrm{S}=4$, where our DUT is a complex eight-port transmission-line network comprising circulators. Altogether, the presented "Virtual VNA 3.0" technique constitutes a scalable approach to unambiguously characterize a many-port \textit{non-reciprocal} DUT with a few-port VNA (only $N_\mathrm{A}>1$ is required) -- without any tedious and error-prone manual reconnections susceptible to inaccuracies. The VNA Extension Kit requirements match those for the "Virtual VNA 2.0" technique that was limited to reciprocal DUTs.

Title: Semantic Communications with Computer Vision Sensing for Edge Video Transmission
Authors: Yubo Peng, Luping Xiang, Kun Yang, Kezhi Wang, Merouane Debbah
Abstract: Despite the widespread adoption of vision sensors in edge applications, such as surveillance, the transmission of video data consumes substantial spectrum resources. Semantic communication (SC) offers a solution by extracting and compressing information at the semantic level, preserving the accuracy and relevance of transmitted data while significantly reducing the volume of transmitted information. However, traditional SC methods face inefficiencies due to the repeated transmission of static frames in edge videos, exacerbated by the absence of sensing capabilities, which results in spectrum inefficiency. To address this challenge, we propose a SC with computer vision sensing (SCCVS) framework for edge video transmission. The framework first introduces a compression ratio (CR) adaptive SC (CRSC) model, capable of adjusting CR based on whether the frames are static or dynamic, effectively conserving spectrum resources. Additionally, we implement an object detection and semantic segmentation models-enabled sensing (OSMS) scheme, which intelligently senses the changes in the scene and assesses the significance of each frame through in-context analysis. Hence, The OSMS scheme provides CR prompts to the CRSC model based on real-time sensing results. Moreover, both CRSC and OSMS are designed as lightweight models, ensuring compatibility with resource-constrained sensors commonly used in practical edge applications. Experimental simulations validate the effectiveness of the proposed SCCVS framework, demonstrating its ability to enhance transmission efficiency without sacrificing critical semantic information.

Title: Federated Learning in NTNs: Design, Architecture and Challenges
Authors: Amin Farajzadeh, Animesh Yadav, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: Non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) are emerging as a core component of future 6G communication systems, providing global connectivity and supporting data-intensive applications. In this paper, we propose a distributed hierarchical federated learning (HFL) framework within the NTN architecture, leveraging a high altitude platform station (HAPS) constellation as intermediate distributed FL servers. Our framework integrates both low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and ground clients in the FL training process while utilizing geostationary orbit (GEO) and medium-Earth orbit (MEO) satellites as relays to exchange FL global models across other HAPS constellations worldwide, enabling seamless, global-scale learning. The proposed framework offers several key benefits: (i) enhanced privacy through the decentralization of the FL mechanism by leveraging the HAPS constellation, (ii) improved model accuracy and reduced training loss while balancing latency, (iii) increased scalability of FL systems through ubiquitous connectivity by utilizing MEO and GEO satellites, and (iv) the ability to use FL data, such as resource utilization metrics, to further optimize the NTN architecture from a network management perspective. A numerical study demonstrates the proposed framework's effectiveness, with improved model accuracy, reduced training loss, and efficient latency management. The article also includes a brief review of FL in NTNs and highlights key challenges and future research directions.

Authors: Fanwen Wang, Ke Wen, Yaqing Luo, Yinzhe Wu, Jiahao Huang, Dudley J. Pennell, Pedro F. Ferreira, Andrew D. Scott, Sonia Nielles-Vallespin, Guang Yang
Abstract: Quantitative MR (qMR) can provide numerical values representing the physical and chemical properties of the tissues. To collect a series of frames under varying settings, retrospective motion correction is essential to align the corresponding anatomical points or features. Under the assumption that the misalignment makes the discrepancy between the corresponding features larger, fitting error is a commonly used evaluation metric for motion correction in qMR. This study evaluates the reliability of the fitting error metric in cardiac diffusion tensor imaging (cDTI) after deformable registration. We found that while fitting error correlates with the negative eigenvalues, the negative Jacobian Determinant increases with broken cardiomyocytes, indicated by helix angle gradient line profiles. Since fitting error measures the distance between moved points and their re-rendered counterparts, the fitting parameter itself may be adjusted due to poor registration. Therefore, fitting error in deformable registration itself is a necessary but not sufficient metric and should be combined with other metrics.

Title: Decision-Dependent Stochastic Optimization: The Role of Distribution Dynamics
Authors: Zhiyu He, Saverio Bolognani, Florian D√∂rfler, Michael Muehlebach
Abstract: Distribution shifts have long been regarded as troublesome external forces that a decision-maker should either counteract or conform to. An intriguing feedback phenomenon termed decision dependence arises when the deployed decision affects the environment and alters the data-generating distribution. In the realm of performative prediction, this is encoded by distribution maps parameterized by decisions due to strategic behaviors. In contrast, we formalize an endogenous distribution shift as a feedback process featuring nonlinear dynamics that couple the evolving distribution with the decision. Stochastic optimization in this dynamic regime provides a fertile ground to examine the various roles played by dynamics in the composite problem structure. To this end, we develop an online algorithm that achieves optimal decision-making by both adapting to and shaping the dynamic distribution. Throughout the paper, we adopt a distributional perspective and demonstrate how this view facilitates characterizations of distribution dynamics and the optimality and generalization performance of the proposed algorithm. We showcase the theoretical results in an opinion dynamics context, where an opportunistic party maximizes the affinity of a dynamic polarized population, and in a recommender system scenario, featuring performance optimization with discrete distributions in the probability simplex.

Title: Advances in Hybrid Modular Climbing Robots: Design Principles and Refinement Strategies
Authors: Ryan Poon, Ian Hunter
Abstract: This paper explores the design strategies for hybrid pole- or trunk-climbing robots, focusing on methods to inform design decisions and assess metrics such as adaptability and performance. A wheeled-grasping hybrid robot with modular, tendon-driven grasping arms and a wheeled drive system mounted on a turret was developed to climb columns of varying diameters. Here, the key innovation is the underactuated arms that can be adjusted to different column sizes by adding or removing modular linkages, though the robot also features capabilities like self-locking (the ability of the robot to stay on the column by friction without power), autonomous grasping, and rotation around the column axis. Mathematical models describe conditions for self-locking and vertical climbing. Experimental results demonstrate the robot's efficacy in climbing and self-locking, validating the proposed models and highlighting the potential for fully automated solutions in industrial applications. This work provides a comprehensive framework for evaluating and designing hybrid climbing robots, contributing to advancements in autonomous robotics for environments where climbing tall structures is critical.

Title: Open-Set Gait Recognition from Sparse mmWave Radar Point Clouds
Authors: Riccardo Mazzieri, Jacopo Pegoraro, Michele Rossi
Abstract: The adoption of Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) radar devices for human sensing, particularly gait recognition, has recently gathered significant attention due to their efficiency, resilience to environmental conditions, and privacy-preserving nature. In this work, we tackle the challenging problem of Open-set Gait Recognition (OSGR) from sparse mmWave radar point clouds. Unlike most existing research, which assumes a closed-set scenario, our work considers the more realistic open-set case, where unknown subjects might be present at inference time, and should be correctly recognized by the system. Point clouds are well-suited for edge computing applications with resource constraints, but are more significantly affected by noise and random fluctuations than other representations, like the more common micro-Doppler signature. This is the first work addressing open-set gait recognition with sparse point cloud data. To do so, we propose a novel neural network architecture that combines supervised classification with unsupervised reconstruction of the point clouds, creating a robust, rich, and highly regularized latent space of gait features. To detect unknown subjects at inference time, we introduce a probabilistic novelty detection algorithm that leverages the structured latent space and offers a tunable trade-off between inference speed and prediction accuracy. Along with this paper, we release mmGait10, an original human gait dataset featuring over five hours of measurements from ten subjects, under varied walking modalities. Extensive experimental results show that our solution attains F1-Score improvements by 24% over state-of-the-art methods, on average, and across multiple openness levels.

Title: A Review on Geometry and Surface Inspection in 3D Concrete Printing
Authors: K. Mawas, M. Maboudi, M. Gerke
Abstract: Given the substantial growth in the use of additive manufacturing in construction (AMC), it is necessary to ensure the quality of printed specimens which can be much more complex than conventionally manufactured parts. This study explores the various aspects of geometry and surface quality control for 3D concrete printing (3DCP), with a particular emphasis on deposition-based methods, namely extrusion and shotcrete 3D printing (SC3DP). A comprehensive overview of existing quality control (QC) methods and strategies is provided and preceded by an in-depth discussion. Four categories of data capture technologies are investigated and their advantages and limitations in the context of AMC are discussed. Additionally, the effects of environmental conditions and objects' properties on data capture are also analyzed. The study extends to automated data capture planning methods for different sensors. Furthermore, various quality control strategies are explored across different stages of the fabrication cycle of the printed object including: (i) During printing, (ii) Layer-wise, (iii) Preassembly, and (iv) Assembly. In addition to reviewing the methods already applied in AMC, we also address various research gaps and future trends and highlight potential methodologies from adjacent domains that could be transferred to AMC.

Title: Interference-Aware Super-Constellation Design for NOMA
Authors: Mojtaba Vaezi, Xinliang Zhang
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) has gained significant attention as a potential next-generation multiple access technique. However, its implementation with finite-alphabet inputs faces challenges. Particularly, due to inter-user interference, superimposed constellations may have overlapping symbols leading to high bit error rates when successive interference cancellation (SIC) is applied. To tackle the issue, this paper employs autoencoders to design interference-aware super-constellations. Unlike conventional methods where superimposed constellation may have overlapping symbols, the proposed autoencoder-based NOMA (AE-NOMA) is trained to design super-constellations with distinguishable symbols at receivers, regardless of channel gains. The proposed architecture removes the need for SIC, allowing maximum likelihood-based approaches to be used instead. The paper presents the conceptual architecture, loss functions, and training strategies for AE-NOMA. Various test results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of interference-aware constellations in improving the bit error rate, indicating the adaptability of AE-NOMA to different channel scenarios and its promising potential for implementing NOMA systems

Title: On w-Optimization of the Split Covariance Intersection Filter
Authors: Hao Li
Abstract: The split covariance intersection filter (split CIF) is a useful tool for general data fusion and has the potential to be applied in a variety of engineering tasks. An indispensable optimization step (referred to as w-optimization) involved in the split CIF concerns the performance and implementation efficiency of the Split CIF, but explanation on w-optimization is neglected in the paper [1] that provides a theoretical foundation for the Split CIF. This note complements [1] by providing a theoretical proof for the convexity of the w-optimization problem involved in the split CIF (convexity is always a desired property for optimization problems as it facilitates optimization considerably).

Visser, Wiro J. Niessen, Stefan Klein (for the Alzheimers Disease Neuroimaging Initiative)
Abstract: Predicting clinical outcomes from medical images using quantitative features (``radiomics'') requires many method design choices, Currently, in new clinical applications, finding the optimal radiomics method out of the wide range of methods relies on a manual, heuristic trial-and-error process. We introduce a novel automated framework that optimizes radiomics workflow construction per application by standardizing the radiomics workflow in modular components, including a large collection of algorithms for each component, and formulating a combined algorithm selection and hyperparameter optimization problem. To solve it, we employ automated machine learning through two strategies (random search and Bayesian optimization) and three ensembling approaches. Results show that a medium-sized random search and straight-forward ensembling perform similar to more advanced methods while being more efficient. Validated across twelve clinical applications, our approach outperforms both a radiomics baseline and human experts. Concluding, our framework improves and streamlines radiomics research by fully automatically optimizing radiomics workflow construction. To facilitate reproducibility, we publicly release six datasets, software of the method, and code to reproduce this study.

Abstract: The sixth generation (6G) mobile communications have attracted substantial attention in the global research community of information and communication technologies (ICT). 6G systems are expected to support not only extended 5G usage scenarios, but also new usage scenarios, such as integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), integrated artificial intelligence (AI) and communication, and communication and ubiquitous connectivity. To realize this goal, channel characteristics must be comprehensively studied and properly exploited, so as to promote the design, standardization, and optimization of 6G systems. In this paper, we first summarize the requirements and challenges in 6G channel research. Our focus is on channels for five promising technologies enabling 6G, including terahertz (THz), extreme MIMO (E-MIMO), ISAC, reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), and space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN). Then, a survey of the progress of the 6G channel research regarding the above five promising technologies is presented in terms of the latest measurement campaigns, new characteristics, modeling methods, and research prospects. Moreover, a tutorial on the 6G channel simulations is presented. We introduce the BUPTCMCCCMG-IMT2030, a 6G link-level channel simulator, developed based on the ITU/3GPP 3D geometry-based stochastic model (GBSM) methodology. The simulator supports the channel simulation of the aforementioned 6G potential technologies. To facilitate the use of the simulator, the tutorial encompasses the design framework, user guidelines, and application examples. This paper offers in-depth, hands-on insights into the best practices of channel measurements, modeling, and simulations for the evaluation of 6G technologies, the development of 6G standards, and the implementation and optimization of 6G systems.

Title: A Model Fusion Distributed Kalman Filter For Non-Gaussian Observation Noise
Authors: Xuemei Mao, Gang Wang, Bei Peng, Jiacheng He, Kun Zhang, Song Gao, Jian Chen
Abstract: Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) represent a critical research domain within the Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The distributed Kalman filter (DKF) has garnered significant attention as an information fusion method for WSNs. However, effectively handling non-Gaussian environments remains a crucial challenge for DKF. This paper proposes a solution by partitioning the noise distribution into multiple Gaussian components, thereby approximating the measurement model with sub-models. We introduce a model fusion distributed Kalman filter (MFDKF) that combines sub-models by assuming independent random processes for the model's transition probabilities. The expectation maximization (EM) algorithm is employed to estimate the relevant parameters. To address specific requirements in WSNs that demand high consensus or have limited communication, two derivative algorithms, namely consensus MFDKF (C-MFDKF) and simplified MFDKF (S-MFDKF), are proposed based on consensus theory. The convergence of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms is analyzed. A series of simulations demonstrate the effectiveness of MFDKF and its derivative algorithms.

Title: Learning to Localize with Attention: from sparse mmWave channel estimates from a single BS to high accuracy 3D location
Authors: Yun Chen, Nuria Gonz√°lez-Prelcic, Takayuki Shimizu, Hongsheng Lu
Abstract: One strategy to obtain user location information in a wireless network operating at millimeter wave (mmWave) is based on the exploitation of the geometric relationships between the channel parameters and the user position. These relationships can be built from the line-of-sight (LOS) path and first-order reflections, or purely first-order reflections, requiring high resolution channel estimates to ensure centimeter level accuracy. In this paper, we consider a mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system employing a hybrid architecture, and develop a low complexity two-stage multidimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (MOMP) algorithm suitable for accurate estimation of high dimensional channels. Then, a deep neural network (DNN) called PathNet is designed to classify the order of the estimated channel paths, so that only the LOS path and first-order reflections are selected for localization. Next, a 3D localization strategy exploiting the geometry of the environment is developed to operate in both LOS and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) conditions, while considering the unknown clock offset between the transmitter (TX) and the receiver (RX). Finally, a Transformer based network exploiting attention mechanisms called ChanFormer is proposed to refine the initial position estimate obtained from geometric localization. Simulation results obtained with realistic vehicular channels indicate that localization errors below 28 cm can be achieved for 80% of the users when the LOS path is present, while sub-meter accuracy can be achieved for 55% of the users in NLOS conditions.

Title: Coordinate-based neural representations for computational adaptive optics in widefield microscopy
Authors: Iksung Kang, Qinrong Zhang, Stella X. Yu, Na Ji
Abstract: Widefield microscopy is widely used for non-invasive imaging of biological structures at subcellular resolution. When applied to complex specimen, its image quality is degraded by sample-induced optical aberration. Adaptive optics can correct wavefront distortion and restore diffraction-limited resolution but require wavefront sensing and corrective devices, increasing system complexity and cost. Here, we describe a self-supervised machine learning algorithm, CoCoA, that performs joint wavefront estimation and three-dimensional structural information extraction from a single input 3D image stack without the need for external training dataset. We implemented CoCoA for widefield imaging of mouse brain tissues and validated its performance with direct-wavefront-sensing-based adaptive optics. Importantly, we systematically explored and quantitatively characterized the limiting factors of CoCoA's performance. Using CoCoA, we demonstrated the first in vivo widefield mouse brain imaging using machine-learning-based adaptive optics. Incorporating coordinate-based neural representations and a forward physics model, the self-supervised scheme of CoCoA should be applicable to microscopy modalities in general.

Title: Finite Sample Performance Analysis of MIMO Systems Identification
Authors: Shuai Sun, Jiayun Li, Yilin Mo
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the finite sample identification performance of an n dimensional discrete-time Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) Linear Time-Invariant system, with p inputs and m outputs. We prove that the widely-used Ho-Kalman algorithm and Multivariable Output Error State Space (MOESP) algorithm are ill-conditioned for MIMO systems when n/m or n/p is large. Moreover, by analyzing the Cramer-Rao bound, we derive a fundamental limit for identifying the real and stable (or marginally stable) poles of MIMO system and prove that the sample complexity for any unbiased pole estimation algorithm to reach a certain level of accuracy explodes superpolynomially with respect to n/(pm). Numerical results are provided to illustrate the ill-conditionedness of Ho-Kalman algorithm and MOESP algorithm as well as the fundamental limit on identification.

Title: Convex Hull Prediction Methods for Bitrate Ladder Construction: Design, Evaluation, and Comparison
Authors: Ahmed Telili, Wassim Hamidouche, Hadi Amirpour, Sid Ahmed Fezza, Luce Morin, Christian Timmerer
Abstract: HTTP adaptive streaming (HAS) has emerged as a prevalent approach for over-the-top (OTT)video streaming services due to its ability to deliver a seamless user experience. A fundamental component of HAS is the bitrate ladder, which comprises a set of encoding parameters (e.g., bitrate-resolution pairs) used to encode the source video into multiple representations. This adaptive bitrate ladder enables the client's video player to dynamically adjust the quality of the video stream in real-time based on fluctuations in network conditions, ensuring uninterrupted playback by selecting the most suitable representation for the available bandwidth. The most straightforward approach involves using a fixed bitrate ladder for all videos, consisting of pre-determined bitrate-resolution pairs known as one-size-fits-all. Conversely, the most reliable technique relies on intensively encoding all resolutions over a wide range of bitrates to build the convex hull, thereby optimizing the bitrate ladder by selecting the representations from the convex hull for each specific video. Several techniques have been proposed to predict content-based ladders without performing a costly, exhaustive search encoding. This paper provides a comprehensive review of various convex hull prediction methods, including both conventional and learning-based approaches. Furthermore, we conduct a benchmark study of several handcrafted- and deep learning (DL)-based approaches for predicting content-optimized convex hulls across multiple codec settings. The considered methods are evaluated on our proposed large-scale dataset, which includes 300 UHD video shots encoded with software and hardware encoders using three state-of-the-art video standards, including ACV/H.264, HEVC/H.265, and VVC/H.266, at various bitrate points. Our analysis provides valuable insights and establishes baseline performance for future research in this field.

Title: Recursively Feasible Chance-constrained Model Predictive Control under Gaussian Mixture Model Uncertainty
Authors: Kai Ren, Colin Chen, Hyeontae Sung, Heejin Ahn, Ian Mitchell, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: We present a chance-constrained model predictive control (MPC) framework under Gaussian mixture model (GMM) uncertainty. Specifically, we consider the uncertainty that arises from predicting future behaviors of moving obstacles, which may exhibit multiple modes (for example, turning left or right). To address the multi-modal uncertainty distribution, we propose three MPC formulations: nominal chance-constrained planning, robust chance-constrained planning, and contingency planning. We prove that closed-loop trajectories generated by the three planners are safe. The approaches differ in conservativeness and performance guarantee. In particular, the robust chance-constrained planner is recursively feasible under certain assumptions on the propagation of prediction uncertainty. On the other hand, the contingency planner generates a less conservative closed-loop trajectory than the nominal planner. We validate our planners using state-of-the-art trajectory prediction algorithms in autonomous driving simulators.

Title: Decentralized Learning Strategies for Estimation Error Minimization with Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Xingran Chen, Navid NaderiAlizadeh, Alejandro Ribeiro, Shirin Saeedi Bidokhti
Abstract: We address the challenge of sampling and remote estimation for autoregressive Markovian processes in a multi-hop wireless network with statistically-identical agents. Agents cache the most recent samples from others and communicate over wireless collision channels governed by an underlying graph topology. Our goal is to minimize time-average estimation error and/or age of information with decentralized scalable sampling and transmission policies, considering both oblivious (where decision-making is independent of the physical processes) and non-oblivious policies (where decision-making depends on physical processes). We prove that in oblivious policies, minimizing estimation error is equivalent to minimizing the age of information. The complexity of the problem, especially the multi-dimensional action spaces and arbitrary network topologies, makes theoretical methods for finding optimal transmission policies intractable. We optimize the policies using a graphical multi-agent reinforcement learning framework, where each agent employs a permutation-equivariant graph neural network architecture. Theoretically, we prove that our proposed framework exhibits desirable transferability properties, allowing transmission policies trained on small- or moderate-size networks to be executed effectively on large-scale topologies. Numerical experiments demonstrate that (i) Our proposed framework outperforms state-of-the-art baselines; (ii) The trained policies are transferable to larger networks, and their performance gains increase with the number of agents; (iii) The training procedure withstands non-stationarity even if we utilize independent learning techniques; and, (iv) Recurrence is pivotal in both independent learning and centralized training and decentralized execution, and improves the resilience to non-stationarity in independent learning.

Title: Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation for Hyperspectral Image Denoising and Destriping
Authors: Shingo Takemoto, Kazuki Naganuma, Shunsuke Ono
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel regularization method, named Spatio-Spectral Structure Tensor Total Variation (S3TTV), for denoising and destriping of hyperspectral (HS) images. HS images are inevitably contaminated by various types of noise, during acquisition process, due to the measurement equipment and the environment. For HS image denoising and destriping tasks, Spatio-Spectral Total Variation (SSTV), defined by the l1-norm of second-order spatio-spectral differences, is widely known as a powerful regularization approach that models the underlying spatio-spectral properties. However, since SSTV refers only to adjacent pixels/bands, semi-local spatial structures are not preserved during denoising process. To address this problem, we newly introduce S3TTV, defined using the nuclear norms of matrices formed by arranging second-order spatio-spectral difference vectors for each band in semi-local area (we call these matrices as spatio-spectral structure tensors). The design of this regularization function preserves the semi-local spatial structures and the spectral correlation across all bands while ensuring robust mixed noise removal. Furthermore, we formulate the HS image denoising and destriping problem as a convex optimization problem involving S3TTV and develop an algorithm based on a preconditioned primal-dual splitting method to solve this problem efficiently. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of S3TTV by comparing it with existing methods, including state-of-the-art ones through denoising and destriping experiments.

Title: Deep Phase Coded Image Prior
Authors: Nimrod Shabtay, Eli Schwartz, Raja Giryes
Abstract: Phase-coded imaging is a computational imaging method designed to tackle tasks such as passive depth estimation and extended depth of field (EDOF) using depth cues inserted during image capture. Most of the current deep learning-based methods for depth estimation or all-in-focus imaging require a training dataset with high-quality depth maps and an optimal focus point at infinity for all-in-focus images. Such datasets are difficult to create, usually synthetic, and require external graphic programs. We propose a new method named "Deep Phase Coded Image Prior" (DPCIP) for jointly recovering the depth map and all-in-focus image from a coded-phase image using solely the captured image and the optical information of the imaging system. Our approach does not depend on any specific dataset and surpasses prior supervised techniques utilizing the same imaging system. This improvement is achieved through the utilization of a problem formulation based on implicit neural representation (INR) and deep image prior (DIP). Due to our zero-shot method, we overcome the barrier of acquiring accurate ground-truth data of depth maps and all-in-focus images for each new phase-coded system introduced. This allows focusing mainly on developing the imaging system, and not on ground-truth data collection.

Title: LiteNeXt: A Novel Lightweight ConvMixer-based Model with Self-embedding Representation Parallel for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Ngoc-Du Tran, Thi-Thao Tran, Quang-Huy Nguyen, Manh-Hung Vu, Van-Truong Pham
Abstract: The emergence of deep learning techniques has advanced the image segmentation task, especially for medical images. Many neural network models have been introduced in the last decade bringing the automated segmentation accuracy close to manual segmentation. However, cutting-edge models like Transformer-based architectures rely on large scale annotated training data, and are generally designed with densely consecutive layers in the encoder, decoder, and skip connections resulting in large number of parameters. Additionally, for better performance, they often be pretrained on a larger data, thus requiring large memory size and increasing resource expenses. In this study, we propose a new lightweight but efficient model, namely LiteNeXt, based on convolutions and mixing modules with simplified decoder, for medical image segmentation. The model is trained from scratch with small amount of parameters (0.71M) and Giga Floating Point Operations Per Second (0.42). To handle boundary fuzzy as well as occlusion or clutter in objects especially in medical image regions, we propose the Marginal Weight Loss that can help effectively determine the marginal boundary between object and background. Additionally, the Self-embedding Representation Parallel technique is proposed as an innovative data augmentation strategy that utilizes the network architecture itself for self-learning augmentation, enhancing feature extraction robustness without external data. Experiments on public datasets including Data Science Bowls, GlaS, ISIC2018, PH2, Sunnybrook, and Lung X-ray data show promising results compared to other state-of-the-art CNN-based and Transformer-based architectures.

Title: ReLaX-VQA: Residual Fragment and Layer Stack Extraction for Enhancing Video Quality Assessment
Authors: Xinyi Wang, Angeliki Katsenou, David Bull
Abstract: With the rapid growth of User-Generated Content (UGC) exchanged between users and sharing platforms, the need for video quality assessment in the wild is increasingly evident. UGC is typically acquired using consumer devices and undergoes multiple rounds of compression (transcoding) before reaching the end user. Therefore, traditional quality metrics that employ the original content as a reference are not suitable. In this paper, we propose ReLaX-VQA, a novel No-Reference Video Quality Assessment (NR-VQA) model that aims to address the challenges of evaluating the quality of diverse video content without reference to the original uncompressed videos. ReLaX-VQA uses frame differences to select spatio-temporal fragments intelligently together with different expressions of spatial features associated with the sampled frames. These are then used to better capture spatial and temporal variabilities in the quality of neighbouring frames. Furthermore, the model enhances abstraction by employing layer-stacking techniques in deep neural network features from Residual Networks and Vision Transformers. Extensive testing across four UGC datasets demonstrates that ReLaX-VQA consistently outperforms existing NR-VQA methods, achieving an average SRCC of 0.8658 and PLCC of 0.8873. Open-source code and trained models that will facilitate further research and applications of NR-VQA can be found at this https URL.

Title: High Frequency Matters: Uncertainty Guided Image Compression with Wavelet Diffusion
Authors: Juan Song, Jiaxiang He, Lijie Yang, Mingtao Feng, Keyan Wang
Abstract: Diffusion probabilistic models have recently achieved remarkable success in generating high-quality images. However, balancing high perceptual quality and low distortion remains challenging in image compression applications. To address this issue, we propose an efficient Uncertainty-Guided image compression approach with wavelet Diffusion (UGDiff). Our approach focuses on high frequency compression via the wavelet transform, since high frequency components are crucial for reconstructing image details. We introduce a wavelet conditional diffusion model for high frequency prediction, followed by a residual codec that compresses and transmits prediction residuals to the decoder. This diffusion prediction-then-residual compression paradigm effectively addresses the low fidelity issue common in direct reconstructions by existing diffusion models. Considering the uncertainty from the random sampling of the diffusion model, we further design an uncertainty-weighted rate-distortion (R-D) loss tailored for residual compression, providing a more rational trade-off between rate and distortion. Comprehensive experiments on two benchmark datasets validate the effectiveness of UGDiff, surpassing state-of-the-art image compression methods in R-D performance, perceptual quality, subjective quality, and inference time.

Title: MIMO Channel Shaping and Rate Maximization Using Beyond Diagonal RIS
Authors: Yang Zhao, Hongyu Li, Bruno Clerckx, Massimo Franceschetti
Abstract: This paper investigates the limits to which a passive Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) can reshape a point-to-point Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) in terms of singular values for improved wireless (e.g., rate and power) performance. We depart from the Diagonal (D) scattering matrix and adopt a Beyond Diagonal (BD) model that exploits element-wise connections for signal amplitude and phase manipulation. Specifically, analytical bounds are derived under popular RIS deployment scenarios to showcase the shaping potentials of BD-RIS on the channel Degrees of Freedom (DoF), singular value spread, power gain, and capacity. A numerical optimization method is then proposed for a broader range of shaping problems and invoked to characterize the achievable singular value region. As a side product, we tackle BD-RIS-aided MIMO rate maximization problem by a local-optimal Alternating Optimization (AO) and a low-complexity shaping-inspired approach. Results show that BD-RIS significantly improves the dynamic range of all channel singular values and the trade-off in manipulating them, resulting in enhanced power gain and achievable rate. Those benefits become more pronounced when the number of RIS elements or MIMO dimensions increase. Of particular interest, BD-RIS is shown to activate multi-stream transmission (hence achieving the asymptotic DoF) at much lower transmit power than D-RIS thanks to its singular value shaping proficiency.

Title: Discrete Spectrum Analysis of Vector OFDM Signals
Authors: Xiang-Gen Xia, Wei Wang
Abstract: Vector OFDM (VOFDM) is equivalent to OTFS and is good for time-varying channels. However, due to its vector form, its signal spectrum is not as clear as that of the conventional OFDM. In this paper, we study the discrete spectrum of discrete VOFDM signals. We obtain a linear relationship between a vector of information symbols and a vector of the same size of components evenly distributed in the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum, and show that if a vector of information symbols is set to 0, then a corresponding vector of the same size of the discrete VOFDM signal spectrum is 0 as well, where the components of the 0 vector are not together but evenly distributed in the spectrum. With the linear relationship, the information symbol vectors can be locally precoded so that any of the discrete spectrum of VOFDM signals can be set to 0, similar to that of the conventional OFDM signals. These results are verified by simulations.

Title: Sufficient and Necessary Barrier-like Conditions for Safety and Reach-avoid Verification of Stochastic Discrete-time Systems
Authors: Bai Xue
Abstract: In this paper, we examine necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions for infinite-horizon safety verification and reach-avoid verification of stochastic discrete-time systems, derived through a relaxation of Bellman equations. Unlike previous methods focused on barrier-like conditions that primarily address sufficiency, our work rigorously integrates both necessity and sufficiency for properties pertaining to infinite time. Safety verification aims to certify the satisfaction of the safety property, which stipulates that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, remaining within a safe set always is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. A necessary and sufficient barrier-like condition is formulated for safety verification. In contrast, reach-avoid verification extends beyond safety to include reachability, seeking to certify the satisfaction of the reach-avoid property. It requires that the probability of the system, starting from a specified initial state, reaching a target set eventually while remaining within a safe set until the first hit of the target, is greater than or equal to a specified lower bound. Two necessary and sufficient barrier-like conditions are formulated under certain assumptions.

Title: Subspace Representation Learning for Sparse Linear Arrays to Localize More Sources than Sensors: A Deep Learning Methodology
Authors: Kuan-Lin Chen, Bhaskar D. Rao
Abstract: Localizing more sources than sensors with a sparse linear array (SLA) has long relied on minimizing a distance between two covariance matrices and recent algorithms often utilize semidefinite programming (SDP). Although deep neural network (DNN)-based methods offer new alternatives, they still depend on covariance matrix fitting. In this paper, we develop a novel methodology that estimates the co-array subspaces from a sample covariance for SLAs. Our methodology trains a DNN to learn signal and noise subspace representations that are invariant to the selection of bases. To learn such representations, we propose loss functions that gauge the separation between the desired and the estimated subspace. In particular, we propose losses that measure the length of the shortest path between subspaces viewed on a union of Grassmannians, and prove that it is possible for a DNN to approximate signal subspaces. The computation of learning subspaces of different dimensions is accelerated by a new batch sampling strategy called consistent rank sampling. The methodology is robust to array imperfections due to its geometry-agnostic and data-driven nature. In addition, we propose a fully end-to-end gridless approach that directly learns angles to study the possibility of bypassing subspace methods. Numerical results show that learning such subspace representations is more beneficial than learning covariances or angles. It outperforms conventional SDP-based methods such as the sparse and parametric approach (SPA) and existing DNN-based covariance reconstruction methods for a wide range of signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), snapshots, and source numbers for both perfect and imperfect arrays.

Title: FCDM: A Physics-Guided Bidirectional Frequency Aware Convolution and Diffusion-Based Model for Sinogram Inpainting
Authors: Jiaze E, Srutarshi Banerjee, Tekin Bicer, Guannan Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Bin Ren
Abstract: Computed tomography (CT) is widely used in industrial and medical imaging, but sparse-view scanning reduces radiation exposure at the cost of incomplete sinograms and challenging reconstruction. Existing RGB-based inpainting models struggle with severe feature entanglement, while sinogram-specific methods often lack explicit physics constraints. We propose FCDM, a physics-guided, frequency-aware sinogram inpainting framework. It integrates bidirectional frequency-domain convolutions to disentangle overlapping features while enforcing total absorption and frequency-domain consistency via a physics-informed loss. To enhance diffusion-based restoration, we introduce a Fourier-enhanced mask embedding to encode angular dependencies and a frequency-adaptive noise scheduling strategy that incorporates a soft row-wise absorption constraint to maintain physical realism. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets show that FCDM outperforms existing methods, achieving SSIM over 0.95 and PSNR above 30 dB, with up to 33% and 29% improvements over baselines.

Title: Self-Supervised Speed of Sound Recovery for Aberration-Corrected Photoacoustic Computed Tomography
Authors: Tianao Li, Manxiu Cui, Cheng Ma, Emma Alexander
Abstract: Photoacoustic computed tomography (PACT) is a non-invasive imaging modality, similar to ultrasound, with wide-ranging medical applications. Conventional PACT images are degraded by wavefront distortion caused by the heterogeneous speed of sound (SOS) in tissue. Accounting for these effects can improve image quality and provide medically useful information, but measuring the SOS directly is burdensome and the existing joint reconstruction method is computationally expensive. Traditional supervised learning techniques are currently inaccessible in this data-starved domain. In this work, we introduce an efficient, self-supervised joint reconstruction method that recovers SOS and high-quality images using a differentiable physics model to solve the semi-blind inverse problem. The SOS, parametrized by either a pixel grid or a neural field (NF), is updated directly by backpropagation. Our method removes SOS aberrations more accurately and 35x faster than the current SOTA. We demonstrate the success of our method quantitatively in simulation and qualitatively on experimentally-collected and in-vivo data.

Title: Online 4D Ultrasound-Guided Robotic Tracking Enables 3D Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy with Large Tissue Displacements
Authors: Jipeng Yan, Qingyuan Tan, Shusei Kawara, Jingwen Zhu, Bingxue Wang, Matthieu Toulemonde, Honghai Liu, Ying Tan, Meng-Xing Tang
Abstract: Super-Resolution Ultrasound (SRUS) imaging through localising and tracking microbubbles, also known as Ultrasound Localisation Microscopy (ULM), has demonstrated significant potential for reconstructing microvasculature and flows with sub-diffraction resolution in clinical diagnostics. However, imaging organs with large tissue movements, such as those caused by respiration, presents substantial challenges. Existing methods often require breath holding to maintain accumulation accuracy, which limits data acquisition time and ULM image saturation. To improve image quality in the presence of large tissue movements, this study introduces an approach integrating high-frame-rate ultrasound with online precise robotic probe control. Tested on a microvasculature phantom with translation motions up to 20 mm, twice the aperture size of the matrix array used, our method achieved real-time tracking of the moving phantom and imaging volume rate at 85 Hz, keeping majority of the target volume in the imaging field of view. ULM images of the moving cross channels in the phantom were successfully reconstructed in post-processing, demonstrating the feasibility of super-resolution imaging under large tissue motions. This represents a significant step towards ULM imaging of organs with large motion.

Title: Brain Tumor Classification on MRI in Light of Molecular Markers
Authors: Jun Liu, Geng Yuan, Weihao Zeng, Hao Tang, Wenbin Zhang, Xue Lin, XiaoLin Xu, Dong Huang, Yanzhi Wang
Abstract: In research findings, co-deletion of the 1p/19q gene is associated with clinical outcomes in low-grade gliomas. The ability to predict 1p19q status is critical for treatment planning and patient follow-up. This study aims to utilize a specially MRI-based convolutional neural network for brain cancer detection. Although public networks such as RestNet and AlexNet can effectively diagnose brain cancers using transfer learning, the model includes quite a few weights that have nothing to do with medical images. As a result, the diagnostic results are unreliable by the transfer learning model. To deal with the problem of trustworthiness, we create the model from the ground up, rather than depending on a pre-trained model. To enable flexibility, we combined convolution stacking with a dropout and full connect operation, it improved performance by reducing overfitting. During model training, we also supplement the given dataset and inject Gaussian noise. We use three--fold cross-validation to train the best selection model. Comparing InceptionV3, VGG16, and MobileNetV2 fine-tuned with pre-trained models, our model produces better results. On an validation set of 125 codeletion vs. 31 not codeletion images, the proposed network achieves 96.37\% percent F1-score, 97.46\% percent precision, and 96.34\% percent recall when classifying 1p/19q codeletion and not codeletion images.

Title: U-net based prediction of cerebrospinal fluid distribution and ventricular reflux grading
Authors: Melanie Rieff, Fabian Holzberger, Oksana Lapina, Geir Ringstad, Lars Magnus Valnes, Bogna Warsza, Kent-Andre Mardal, Per Kristian Eide, Barbara Wohlmuth
Abstract: Previous work indicates evidence that cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) plays a crucial role in brain waste clearance processes, and that altered flow patterns are associated with various diseases of the central nervous system. In this study, we investigate the potential of deep learning to predict the distribution in human brain of a gadolinium-based CSF contrast agent (tracer) administered intrathecal. For this, T1-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans taken at multiple time points before and after injection were utilized. We propose a U-net-based supervised learning model to predict pixel-wise signal increase at its peak after 24 hours. Performance is evaluated based on different tracer distribution stages provided during training, including predictions from baseline scans taken before injection. Our findings show that training with imaging data from only the first two hours post-injection yields tracer flow predictions comparable to models trained with additional later-stage scans. Validation against ventricular reflux gradings from neuroradiologists confirmed alignment with expert evaluations. These results demonstrate that deep learning-based methods for CSF flow prediction deserve more attention, as minimizing MR imaging without compromising clinical analysis could enhance efficiency, improve patient well-being, and lower healthcare costs.

Title: Efficient Feature Extraction and Classification Architecture for MRI-Based Brain Tumor Detection and Localization
Authors: Plabon Paul, Md. Nazmul Islam, Fazle Rafsani, Pegah Khorasani, Shovito Barua Soumma
Abstract: Uncontrolled cell division in the brain is what gives rise to brain tumors. If the tumor size increases by more than half, there is little hope for the patient's recovery. This emphasizes the need of rapid and precise brain tumor diagnosis. When it comes to analyzing, diagnosing, and planning therapy for brain tumors, MRI imaging plays a crucial role. A brain tumor's development history is crucial information for doctors to have. When it comes to distinguishing between human soft tissues, MRI scans are superior. In order to get reliable classification results from MRI scans quickly, deep learning is one of the most practical methods. Early human illness diagnosis has been demonstrated to be more accurate when deep learning methods are used. In the case of diagnosing a brain tumor, when even a little misdiagnosis might have serious consequences, accuracy is especially important. Disclosure of brain tumors in medical images is still a difficult task. Brain MRIs are notoriously imprecise in revealing the presence or absence of tumors. Using MRI scans of the brain, a CNN was trained to identify the presence of a tumor in this research. Results from the CNN model showed an accuracy of 99.17%. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved. The CNN model's characteristics were also retrieved and we also localized the tumor regions from the unannotated images using GradCAM, a deep learning explainability tool. In order to evaluate the CNN model's capability for processing images, we applied the features into different ML models. CNN and machine learning models were also evaluated using the standard metrics of Precision, Recall, Specificity, and F1 score. The significance of the doctor's diagnosis enhanced the accuracy of the CNN model's assistance in identifying the existence of tumor and treating the patient.

Title: Koopman-based control using sum-of-squares optimization: Improved stability guarantees and data efficiency
Authors: Robin Str√§sser, Julian Berberich, Frank Allg√∂wer
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel controller design approach for unknown nonlinear systems using the Koopman operator. In particular, we use the recently proposed stability- and certificate-oriented extended dynamic mode decomposition (SafEDMD) architecture to generate a data-driven bilinear surrogate model with certified error bounds. Then, by accounting for the obtained error bounds in a controller design based on the bilinear system, one can guarantee closed-loop stability for the true nonlinear system. While existing approaches over-approximate the bilinearity of the surrogate model, thus introducing conservatism and providing only local guarantees, we explicitly account for the bilinearity by using sum-of-squares (SOS) optimization in the controller design. More precisely, we parametrize a rational controller stabilizing the error-affected bilinear surrogate model and, consequently, the underlying nonlinear system. The resulting SOS optimization problem provides explicit data-driven controller design conditions for unknown nonlinear systems based on semidefinite programming. Our approach significantly reduces conservatism by establishing a larger region of attraction and improved data efficiency. The proposed method is evaluated using numerical examples, demonstrating its advantages over existing approaches.

Title: Probabilistic Dynamic Line Rating Forecasting with Line Graph Convolutional LSTM
Authors: Minsoo Kim, Vladimir Dvorkin, Jip Kim
Abstract: Dynamic line rating (DLR) is a promising solution to increase the utilization of transmission lines by adjusting ratings based on real-time weather conditions. Accurate DLR forecast at the scheduling stage is thus necessary for system operators to proactively optimize power flows, manage congestion, and reduce the cost of grid operations. However, the DLR forecast remains challenging due to weather uncertainty. To reliably predict DLRs, we propose a new probabilistic forecasting model based on line graph convolutional LSTM. Like standard LSTM networks, our model accounts for temporal correlations between DLRs across the planning horizon. The line graph-structured network additionally allows us to leverage the spatial correlations of DLR features across the grid to improve the quality of predictions. Simulation results on the synthetic Texas 123-bus system demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the baseline probabilistic DLR forecasting models regarding reliability and sharpness while using the fewest parameters.

Title: Adversarial Diffusion Compression for Real-World Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Bin Chen, Gehui Li, Rongyuan Wu, Xindong Zhang, Jie Chen, Jian Zhang, Lei Zhang
Abstract: Real-world image super-resolution (Real-ISR) aims to reconstruct high-resolution images from low-resolution inputs degraded by complex, unknown processes. While many Stable Diffusion (SD)-based Real-ISR methods have achieved remarkable success, their slow, multi-step inference hinders practical deployment. Recent SD-based one-step networks like OSEDiff and S3Diff alleviate this issue but still incur high computational costs due to their reliance on large pretrained SD models. This paper proposes a novel Real-ISR method, AdcSR, by distilling the one-step diffusion network OSEDiff into a streamlined diffusion-GAN model under our Adversarial Diffusion Compression (ADC) framework. We meticulously examine the modules of OSEDiff, categorizing them into two types: (1) Removable (VAE encoder, prompt extractor, text encoder, etc.) and (2) Prunable (denoising UNet and VAE decoder). Since direct removal and pruning can degrade the model's generation capability, we pretrain our pruned VAE decoder to restore its ability to decode images and employ adversarial distillation to compensate for performance loss. This ADC-based diffusion-GAN hybrid design effectively reduces complexity by 73% in inference time, 78% in computation, and 74% in parameters, while preserving the model's generation capability. Experiments manifest that our proposed AdcSR achieves competitive recovery quality on both synthetic and real-world datasets, offering up to 9.3$\times$ speedup over previous one-step diffusion-based methods.

Title: Self-Supervised Diffusion MRI Denoising via Iterative and Stable Refinement
Authors: Chenxu Wu, Qingpeng Kong, Zihang Jiang, S. Kevin Zhou
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), including diffusion MRI (dMRI), serves as a ``microscope'' for anatomical structures and routinely mitigates the influence of low signal-to-noise ratio scans by compromising temporal or spatial resolution. However, these compromises fail to meet clinical demands for both efficiency and precision. Consequently, denoising is a vital preprocessing step, particularly for dMRI, where clean data is unavailable. In this paper, we introduce Di-Fusion, a fully self-supervised denoising method that leverages the latter diffusion steps and an adaptive sampling process. Unlike previous approaches, our single-stage framework achieves efficient and stable training without extra noise model training and offers adaptive and controllable results in the sampling process. Our thorough experiments on real and simulated data demonstrate that Di-Fusion achieves state-of-the-art performance in microstructure modeling, tractography tracking, and other downstream tasks.

Title: Comparative clinical evaluation of "memory-efficient" synthetic 3d generative adversarial networks (gan) head-to-head to state of art: results on computed tomography of the chest
Authors: Mahshid Shiri, Chandra Bortolotto, Alessandro Bruno, Alessio Consonni, Daniela Maria Grasso, Leonardo Brizzi, Daniele Loiacono, Lorenzo Preda
Abstract: Introduction: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) are increasingly used to generate synthetic medical images, addressing the critical shortage of annotated data for training Artificial Intelligence (AI) systems. This study introduces a novel memory-efficient GAN architecture, incorporating Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) to generate high-resolution 3D medical images and evaluates its performance against the state-of-the-art hierarchical (HA)-GAN model. Materials and Methods: The CRF-GAN was trained using the open-source lung CT LUNA16 dataset. The architecture was compared to HA-GAN through a quantitative evaluation, using Frechet Inception Distance (FID) and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) metrics, and a qualitative evaluation, through a two-alternative forced choice (2AFC) test completed by a pool of 12 resident radiologists, in order to assess the realism of the generated images. Results: CRF-GAN outperformed HA-GAN with lower FID (0.047 vs. 0.061) and MMD (0.084 vs. 0.086) scores, indicating better image fidelity. The 2AFC test showed a significant preference for images generated by CRF-Gan over those generated by HA-GAN with a p-value of 1.93e-05. Additionally, CRF-GAN demonstrated 9.34% lower memory usage at 256 resolution and achieved up to 14.6% faster training speeds, offering substantial computational savings. Discussion: CRF-GAN model successfully generates high-resolution 3D medical images with non-inferior quality to conventional models, while being more memory-efficient and faster. Computational power and time saved can be used to improve the spatial resolution and anatomical accuracy of generated images, which is still a critical factor limiting their direct clinical applicability.

Title: Universal Vessel Segmentation for Multi-Modality Retinal Images
Authors: Bo Wen, Anna Heinke, Akshay Agnihotri, Dirk-Uwe Bartsch, William Freeman, Truong Nguyen, Cheolhong An
Abstract: We identify two major limitations in the existing studies on retinal vessel segmentation: (1) Most existing works are restricted to one modality, i.e, the Color Fundus (CF). However, multi-modality retinal images are used every day in the study of retina and retinal diseases, and the study of vessel segmentation on the other modalities is scarce; (2) Even though a small amount of works extended their experiments to limited new modalities such as the Multi-Color Scanning Laser Ophthalmoscopy (MC), these works still require finetuning a separate model for the new modality. The finetuning will require extra training data, which is difficult to acquire. In this work, we present a foundational universal vessel segmentation model (UVSM) for multi-modality retinal images. Not only do we perform the study on a much wider range of modalities, but we also propose a universal model to segment the vessels in all these commonly-used modalities. Despite being much more versatile comparing with existing methods, our universal model still demonstrates comparable performance with the state-of-the-art finetuned methods. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that achieves cross-modality retinal vessel segmentation and also the first work to study retinal vessel segmentation in some novel modalities.

Title: A Concise Tutorial for Analyzing Electromagnetic Degrees of Freedom for Continuous-Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Boqun Zhao, Xingqi Zhang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A concise tutorial is provided for analysis of the spatial degrees of freedom (DoFs) in continuous-aperture array (CAPA)-based continuous electromagnetic (EM) channels. First, a simplified spatial model is introduced using the Fresnel approximation. By leveraging this model and Landau's theorem, a closed-form expression for the spatial DoFs is derived. The results show that the number of DoFs is proportional to the transmit and receive aperture sizes and inversely proportional to the propagation distance. Numerical results are presented to illustrate the properties of EM DoFs in CAPA-based channels.

Title: VesselSAM: Leveraging SAM for Aortic Vessel Segmentation with LoRA and Atrous Attention
Authors: Adnan Iltaf, Rayan Merghani Ahmed, Zhenxi Zhang, Bin Li, Shoujun Zhou
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is crucial for clinical diagnosis and treatment planning, especially when dealing with complex anatomical structures such as vessels. However, accurately segmenting vessels remains challenging due to their small size, intricate edge structures, and susceptibility to artifacts and imaging noise. In this work, we propose VesselSAM, an enhanced version of the Segment Anything Model (SAM), specifically tailored for aortic vessel segmentation. VesselSAM incorporates AtrousLoRA, a novel module integrating Atrous Attention and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), to enhance segmentation performance. Atrous Attention enables the model to capture multi-scale contextual information, preserving both fine-grained local details and broader global context. Additionally, LoRA facilitates efficient fine-tuning of the frozen SAM image encoder, reducing the number of trainable parameters and thereby enhancing computational efficiency. We evaluate VesselSAM using two challenging datasets: the Aortic Vessel Tree (AVT) dataset and the Type-B Aortic Dissection (TBAD) dataset. VesselSAM achieves state-of-the-art performance, attaining DSC scores of 93.50\%, 93.25\%, 93.02\%, and 93.26\% across multi-center datasets. Our results demonstrate that VesselSAM delivers high segmentation accuracy while significantly reducing computational overhead compared to existing large-scale models. This development paves the way for enhanced AI-based aortic vessel segmentation in clinical environments. The code and models will be released at this https URL.

Title: Conformal Lyapunov Optimization: Optimal Resource Allocation under Deterministic Reliability Constraints
Authors: Francesco Binucci, Osvaldo Simeone, Paolo Banelli
Abstract: This paper introduces conformal Lyapunov optimization (CLO), a novel resource allocation framework for networked systems that optimizes average long-term objectives, while satisfying deterministic long-term reliability constraints. Unlike traditional Lyapunov optimization (LO), which addresses resource allocation tasks under average long-term constraints, CLO provides formal worst-case deterministic reliability guarantees. This is achieved by integrating the standard LO optimization framework with online conformal risk control (O-CRC), an adaptive update mechanism controlling long-term risks. The effectiveness of CLO is verified via experiments for hierarchal edge inference targeting image segmentation tasks in a networked computing architecture. Specifically, simulation results confirm that CLO can control reliability constraints, measured via the false negative rate of all the segmentation decisions made in the network, while at the same time minimizing the weighted sum of energy consumption and imprecision, with the latter accounting for the rate of false positives.

Title: A Game-Theoretic Approach for High-Resolution Automotive FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance
Authors: Yunian Pan, Jun Li, Lifan Xu, Shunqiao Sun, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: Nonlinear frequency hopping has emerged as a promising approach for mitigating interference and enhancing range resolution in automotive FMCW radar systems. Achieving an optimal balance between high range-resolution and effective interference mitigation remains challenging, especially without centralized frequency scheduling. This paper presents a game-theoretic framework for interference avoidance, in which each radar operates as an independent player, optimizing its performance through decentralized decision-making. We examine two equilibrium concepts--Nash Equilibrium (NE) and Coarse Correlated Equilibrium (CCE)--as strategies for frequency band allocation, with CCE demonstrating particular effectiveness through regret minimization algorithms. We propose two interference avoidance algorithms: Nash Hopping, a model-based approach, and No-Regret Hopping, a model-free adaptive method. Simulation results indicate that both methods effectively reduce interference and enhance the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR). Notably, No-regret Hopping further optimizes frequency spectrum utilization, achieving improved range resolution compared to Nash Hopping.

Title: Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation for Unsupervised Chorioallantoic Membrane Vessel Segmentation
Authors: Pengwu Song, Liang Xu, Peng Yao, Shuwei Shen, Pengfei Shao, Mingzhai Sun, Ronald X. Xu
Abstract: The chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) model is widely employed in angiogenesis research, and distribution of growing blood vessels is the key evaluation indicator. As a result, vessel segmentation is crucial for quantitative assessment based on topology and morphology. However, manual segmentation is extremely time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to inconsistency due to its subjective nature. Moreover, research on CAM vessel segmentation algorithms remains limited, and the lack of public datasets contributes to poor prediction performance. To address these challenges, we propose an innovative Intermediate Domain-guided Adaptation (IDA) method, which utilizes the similarity between CAM images and retinal images, along with existing public retinal datasets, to perform unsupervised training on CAM images. Specifically, we introduce a Multi-Resolution Asymmetric Translation (MRAT) strategy to generate intermediate images to promote image-level interaction. Then, an Intermediate Domain-guided Contrastive Learning (IDCL) module is developed to disentangle cross-domain feature representations. This method overcomes the limitations of existing unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) approaches, which primarily concentrate on directly source-target alignment while neglecting intermediate domain information. Notably, we create the first CAM dataset to validate the proposed algorithm. Extensive experiments on this dataset show that our method outperforms compared approaches. Moreover, it achieves superior performance in UDA tasks across retinal datasets, highlighting its strong generalization capability. The CAM dataset and source codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Adaptive Subarray Segmentation: A New Paradigm of Spatial Non-Stationary Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Shuhang Yang, Puguang An, Peng Yang, Xianbin Cao, Dapeng Oliver Wu, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: To tackle the complexities of spatial non-stationary (SnS) effects and spherical wave propagation in near-field channel estimation (CE) for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems, this paper introduces an innovative SnS near-field CE framework grounded in adaptive subarray partitioning. Conventional methods relying on equal subarray partitioning often lead to suboptimal divisions, undermining CE precision. To overcome this, we propose an adaptive subarray segmentation approach. First, we develop a spherical-wave channel model customized for line-of-sight (LoS) XL-MIMO systems to capture SnS traits. Next, we define and evaluate the adverse effects of over-segmentation and under-segmentation on CE efficacy. To counter these issues, we introduce a novel dynamic hybrid beamforming-assisted power-based subarray segmentation paradigm (DHBF-PSSP), which merges cost-effective power measurements with a DHBF structure, enabling joint subarray partitioning and decoupling. A robust partitioning algorithm, termed power-adaptive subarray segmentation (PASS), exploits statistical features of power profiles, while the DHBF utilizes subarray segmentation-based group time block code (SS-GTBC) to enable efficient subarray decoupling with limited radio frequency (RF) chain resources. Additionally, by utilizing angular-domain block sparsity and inter-subcarrier structured sparsity, we propose a subarray segmentation-based assorted block sparse Bayesian learning algorithm under the multiple measurement vectors framework (SS-ABSBL-MMV), employing discrete Fourier transform (DFT) codebooks to lower complexity. Extensive simulation results validate the exceptional performance of the proposed framework over its counterparts.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access: Finite Constellations, Receiver Design, and SIC-free Implementation
Authors: Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx, David Vargas, Oliver Haffenden, Andrew Murphy
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) has emerged as a novel multiple access technique that enlarges the achievable rate region of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) broadcast channels with linear precoding. In this work, we jointly address three practical but fundamental questions: (1) How to exploit the benefit of RSMA under finite constellations? (2) What are the potential and promising ways to implement RSMA receivers? (3) Can RSMA still retain its superiority in the absence of successive interference cancellers (SIC)? To address these concerns, we first propose low-complexity precoder designs taking finite constellations into account and show that the potential of RSMA is better achieved with such designs than those assuming Gaussian signalling. We then consider some practical receiver designs that can be applied to RSMA. We notice that these receiver designs follow one of two principles: (1) SIC: cancelling upper layer signals before decoding the lower layer and (2) non-SIC: treating upper layer signals as noise when decoding the lower layer. In light of this, we propose to alter the precoder design according to the receiver category. Through link-level simulations, the effectiveness of the proposed precoder and receiver designs are verified. More importantly, we show that it is possible to preserve the superiority of RSMA over Spatial Domain Multiple Access (SDMA), including SDMA with advanced receivers, even without SIC at the receivers. Those results therefore open the door to competitive implementable RSMA strategies for 6G and beyond communications.

Title: Underwater Motions Analysis and Control of a Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicle
Authors: Dongyue Huang, Minghao Dou, Xuchen Liu, Tao Sun, Jianguo Zhang, Ning Ding, Xinlei Chen, Ben M. Chen
Abstract: Coupling-Tiltable Unmanned Aerial-Aquatic Vehicles (UAAVs) have gained increasing importance, yet lack comprehensive analysis and suitable controllers. This paper analyzes the underwater motion characteristics of a self-designed UAAV, Mirs-Alioth, and designs a controller for it. The effectiveness of the controller is validated through experiments. The singularities of Mirs-Alioth are derived as Singular Thrust Tilt Angle (STTA), which serve as an essential tool for an analysis of its underwater motion characteristics. The analysis reveals several key factors for designing the controller. These include the need for logic switching, using a Nussbaum function to compensate control direction uncertainty in the auxiliary channel, and employing an auxiliary controller to mitigate coupling effects. Based on these key points, a control scheme is designed. It consists of a controller that regulates the thrust tilt angle to the singular value, an auxiliary controller incorporating a Saturated Nussbaum function, and a logic switch. Eventually, two sets of experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the controller and demonstrate the necessity of the Nussbaum function.

Title: Adaptive Kalman-Informed Transformer
Authors: Nadav Cohen, Itzik Klein
Abstract: The extended Kalman filter (EKF) is a widely adopted method for sensor fusion in navigation applications. A crucial aspect of the EKF is the online determination of the process noise covariance matrix reflecting the model uncertainty. While common EKF implementation assumes a constant process noise, in real-world scenarios, the process noise varies, leading to inaccuracies in the estimated state and potentially causing the filter to diverge. Model-based adaptive EKF methods were proposed and demonstrated performance improvements to cope with such situations, highlighting the need for a robust adaptive approach. In this paper, we derive an adaptive Kalman-informed transformer (A-KIT) designed to learn the varying process noise covariance online. Built upon the foundations of the EKF, A-KIT utilizes the well-known capabilities of set transformers, including inherent noise reduction and the ability to capture nonlinear behavior in the data. This approach is suitable for any application involving the EKF. In a case study, we demonstrate the effectiveness of A-KIT in nonlinear fusion between a Doppler velocity log and inertial sensors. This is accomplished using real data recorded from sensors mounted on an autonomous underwater vehicle operating in the Mediterranean Sea. We show that A-KIT outperforms the conventional EKF by more than 49.5% and model-based adaptive EKF by an average of 35.4% in terms of position accuracy.

Title: Fully Reversing the Shoebox Image Source Method: From Impulse Responses to Room Parameters
Authors: Tom Sprunck (IRMA, MACARON), Antoine Deleforge (IRMA, MACARON), Yannick Privat (IECL, SPHINX, IUF), C√©dric Foy (UMRAE, Cerema Direction Est)
Abstract: We present an algorithm that fully reverses the shoebox image source method (ISM), a popular and widely used room impulse response (RIR) simulator for cuboid rooms introduced by Allen and Berkley in 1979. More precisely, given a discrete multichannel RIR generated by the shoebox ISM for a microphone array of known geometry, the algorithm reliably recovers the 18 input parameters. These are the 3D source position, the 3 dimensions of the room, the 6-degrees-of-freedom room translation and orientation, and an absorption coefficient for each of the 6 room boundaries. The approach builds on a recently proposed gridless image source localization technique combined with new procedures for room axes recovery and first-order-reflection identification. Extensive simulated experiments reveal that near-exact recovery of all parameters is achieved for a 32-element, 8.4-cm-wide spherical microphone array and a sampling rate of 16~kHz using fully randomized input parameters within rooms of size 2X2X2 to 10X10X5 meters. Estimation errors decay towards zero when increasing the array size and sampling rate. The method is also shown to strongly outperform a known baseline, and its ability to extrapolate RIRs at new positions is demonstrated. Crucially, the approach is strictly limited to low-passed discrete RIRs simulated using the vanilla shoebox ISM. Nonetheless, it represents to our knowledge the first algorithmic demonstration that this difficult inverse problem is in-principle fully solvable over a wide range of configurations.

Title: SoundCTM: Unifying Score-based and Consistency Models for Full-band Text-to-Sound Generation
Authors: Koichi Saito, Dongjun Kim, Takashi Shibuya, Chieh-Hsin Lai, Zhi Zhong, Yuhta Takida, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Sound content creation, essential for multimedia works such as video games and films, often involves extensive trial-and-error, enabling creators to semantically reflect their artistic ideas and inspirations, which evolve throughout the creation process, into the sound. Recent high-quality diffusion-based Text-to-Sound (T2S) generative models provide valuable tools for creators. However, these models often suffer from slow inference speeds, imposing an undesirable burden that hinders the trial-and-error process. While existing T2S distillation models address this limitation through 1-step generation, the sample quality of $1$-step generation remains insufficient for production use. Additionally, while multi-step sampling in those distillation models improves sample quality itself, the semantic content changes due to their lack of deterministic sampling capabilities. To address these issues, we introduce Sound Consistency Trajectory Models (SoundCTM), which allow flexible transitions between high-quality $1$-step sound generation and superior sound quality through multi-step deterministic sampling. This allows creators to efficiently conduct trial-and-error with 1-step generation to semantically align samples with their intention, and subsequently refine sample quality with preserving semantic content through deterministic multi-step sampling. To develop SoundCTM, we reframe the CTM training framework, originally proposed in computer vision, and introduce a novel feature distance using the teacher network for a distillation loss. For production-level generation, we scale up our model to 1B trainable parameters, making SoundCTM-DiT-1B the first large-scale distillation model in the sound community to achieve both promising high-quality 1-step and multi-step full-band (44.1kHz) generation.

Title: Surpassing Cosine Similarity for Multidimensional Comparisons: Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric
Authors: Federico Tessari, Kunpeng Yao, Neville Hogan
Abstract: Advances in computational power and hardware efficiency have enabled tackling increasingly complex, high-dimensional problems. While artificial intelligence (AI) achieves remarkable results, the interpretability of high-dimensional solutions remains challenging. A critical issue is the comparison of multidimensional quantities, essential in techniques like Principal Component Analysis. Metrics such as cosine similarity are often used, for example in the development of natural language processing algorithms or recommender systems. However, the interpretability of such metrics diminishes as dimensions increase. This paper analyzes the effects of dimensionality, revealing significant limitations of cosine similarity, particularly its dependency on the dimension of vectors, leading to biased and poorly interpretable outcomes. To address this, we introduce a Dimension Insensitive Euclidean Metric (DIEM) which demonstrates superior robustness and generalizability across dimensions. DIEM maintains consistent variability and eliminates the biases observed in traditional metrics, making it a reliable tool for high-dimensional comparisons. An example of the advantages of DIEM over cosine similarity is reported for a large language model application. This novel metric has the potential to replace cosine similarity, providing a more accurate and insightful method to analyze multidimensional data in fields ranging from neuromotor control to machine learning.

Title: Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model for Extreme Image Rescaling
Authors: Ce Wang, Zhenyu Hu, Wanjie Sun, Zhenzhong Chen
Abstract: Image rescaling aims to learn the optimal low-resolution (LR) image that can be accurately reconstructed to its original high-resolution (HR) counterpart, providing an efficient image processing and storage method for ultra-high definition media. However, extreme downscaling factors pose significant challenges to the upscaling process due to its highly ill-posed nature, causing existing image rescaling methods to struggle in generating semantically correct structures and perceptual friendly textures. In this work, we propose a novel framework called Timestep-Aware Diffusion Model (TADM) for extreme image rescaling, which performs rescaling operations in the latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder and effectively leverages powerful natural image priors learned by a pre-trained text-to-image diffusion model. Specifically, TADM adopts a pseudo-invertible module to establish the bidirectional mapping between the latent features of the HR image and the target-sized LR image. Then, the rescaled latent features are enhanced by a pre-trained diffusion model to generate more faithful details. Considering the spatially non-uniform degradation caused by the rescaling operation, we propose a novel time-step alignment strategy, which can adaptively allocate the generative capacity of the diffusion model based on the quality of the reconstructed latent features. Extensive experiments demonstrate the superiority of TADM over previous methods in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

Title: AI, Entrepreneurs, and Privacy: Deep Learning Outperforms Humans in Detecting Entrepreneurs from Image Data
Authors: Martin Obschonka, Christian Fisch, Tharindu Fernando, Clinton Fookes
Abstract: Occupational outcomes like entrepreneurship are generally considered personal information that individuals should have the autonomy to disclose. With the advancing capability of artificial intelligence (AI) to infer private details from widely available human-centric data (e.g., social media), it is crucial to investigate whether AI can accurately extract private occupational information from such data. In this study, we demonstrate that deep neural networks can classify individuals as entrepreneurs with high accuracy based on facial images sourced from Crunchbase, a premier source for entrepreneurship data. Utilizing a dataset comprising facial images of 40,728 individuals, including both entrepreneurs and non-entrepreneurs, we train a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) using a contrastive learning approach based on pairs of facial images (one entrepreneur and one non-entrepreneur per pair). While human experts (n=650) and trained participants (n=133) were unable to classify entrepreneurs with accuracy above chance levels (>50%), our AI model achieved a classification accuracy of 79.51%. Several robustness tests indicate that this high level of accuracy is maintained under various conditions. These results indicate privacy risks for entrepreneurs.

Title: Fitted Q-Iteration via Max-Plus-Linear Approximation
Authors: Y. Liu, M. A. S. Kolarijani
Abstract: In this study, we consider the application of max-plus-linear approximators for Q-function in offline reinforcement learning of discounted Markov decision processes. In particular, we incorporate these approximators to propose novel fitted Q-iteration (FQI) algorithms with provable convergence. Exploiting the compatibility of the Bellman operator with max-plus operations, we show that the max-plus-linear regression within each iteration of the proposed FQI algorithm reduces to simple max-plus matrix-vector multiplications. We also consider the variational implementation of the proposed algorithm which leads to a per-iteration complexity that is independent of the number of samples.

Title: Towards Sub-millisecond Latency Real-Time Speech Enhancement Models on Hearables
Authors: Artem Dementyev, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Scott Wisdom, Navin Chatlani, John R. Hershey, Richard F.Lyon
Abstract: Low latency models are critical for real-time speech enhancement applications, such as hearing aids and hearables. However, the sub-millisecond latency space for resource-constrained hearables remains underexplored. We demonstrate speech enhancement using a computationally efficient minimum-phase FIR filter, enabling sample-by-sample processing to achieve mean algorithmic latency of 0.32 ms to 1.25 ms. With a single microphone, we observe a mean SI-SDRi of 4.1 dB. The approach shows generalization with a DNSMOS increase of 0.2 on unseen audio recordings. We use a lightweight LSTM-based model of 626k parameters to generate FIR taps. Using a real hardware implementation on a low-power DSP, our system can run with 376 MIPS and a mean end-to-end latency of 3.35 ms. In addition, we provide a comparison with existing low-latency spectral masking techniques. We hope this work will enable a better understanding of latency and can be used to improve the comfort and usability of hearables.

Title: Biodenoising: Animal Vocalization Denoising without Access to Clean Data
Authors: Marius Miron, Sara Keen, Jen-Yu Liu, Benjamin Hoffman, Masato Hagiwara, Olivier Pietquin, Felix Effenberger, Maddie Cusimano
Abstract: Animal vocalization denoising is a task similar to human speech enhancement, which is relatively well-studied. In contrast to the latter, it comprises a higher diversity of sound production mechanisms and recording environments, and this higher diversity is a challenge for existing models. Adding to the challenge and in contrast to speech, we lack large and diverse datasets comprising clean vocalizations. As a solution we use as training data pseudo-clean targets, i.e. pre-denoised vocalizations, and segments of background noise without a vocalization. We propose a train set derived from bioacoustics datasets and repositories representing diverse species, acoustic environments, geographic regions. Additionally, we introduce a non-overlapping benchmark set comprising clean vocalizations from different taxa and noise samples. We show that that denoising models (demucs, CleanUNet) trained on pseudo-clean targets obtained with speech enhancement models achieve competitive results on the benchmarking set. We publish data, code, libraries, and demos at this https URL.

Title: Hierarchical Uncertainty Estimation for Learning-based Registration in Neuroimaging
Authors: Xiaoling Hu, Karthik Gopinath, Peirong Liu, Malte Hoffmann, Koen Van Leemput, Oula Puonti, Juan Eugenio Iglesias
Abstract: Over recent years, deep learning based image registration has achieved impressive accuracy in many domains, including medical imaging and, specifically, human neuroimaging with magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). However, the uncertainty estimation associated with these methods has been largely limited to the application of generic techniques (e.g., Monte Carlo dropout) that do not exploit the peculiarities of the problem domain, particularly spatial modeling. Here, we propose a principled way to propagate uncertainties (epistemic or aleatoric) estimated at the level of spatial location by these methods, to the level of global transformation models, and further to downstream tasks. Specifically, we justify the choice of a Gaussian distribution for the local uncertainty modeling, and then propose a framework where uncertainties spread across hierarchical levels, depending on the choice of transformation model. Experiments on publicly available data sets show that Monte Carlo dropout correlates very poorly with the reference registration error, whereas our uncertainty estimates correlate much better. Crucially, the results also show that uncertainty-aware fitting of transformations improves the registration accuracy of brain MRI scans. Finally, we illustrate how sampling from the posterior distribution of the transformations can be used to propagate uncertainties to downstream neuroimaging tasks.

Abstract: Synthetic Data Generation (SDG) based on Artificial Intelligence (AI) can transform the way clinical medicine is delivered by overcoming privacy barriers that currently render clinical data sharing difficult. This is the key to accelerating the development of digital tools contributing to enhanced patient safety. Such tools include robust data-driven clinical decision support systems, and example-based digital training tools that will enable healthcare professionals to improve their diagnostic performance for enhanced patient safety. This study focuses on the clinical evaluation of medical SDG, with a proof-of-concept investigation on diagnosing Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) using Wireless Capsule Endoscopy (WCE) images. Its scientific contributions include a) a novel protocol for the systematic Clinical Evaluation of Medical Image Synthesis (CEMIS); b) a novel variational autoencoder-based model for the generation of high-resolution synthetic WCE images; and c) a comprehensive evaluation of the synthetic images using the CEMIS protocol by 10 international WCE specialists, in terms of image quality, diversity, and realism, as well as their utility for clinical decision-making. The results show that TIDE-II generates clinically plausible, very realistic WCE images, of improved quality compared to relevant state-of-the-art generative models. Concludingly, CEMIS can serve as a reference for future research on medical image-generation techniques, while the adaptation/extension of the architecture of TIDE-II to other imaging domains can be promising.

Title: Hybrid Attention Model Using Feature Decomposition and Knowledge Distillation for Glucose Forecasting
Authors: Ebrahim Farahmand, Shovito Barua Soumma, Nooshin Taheri Chatrudi, Hassan Ghasemzadeh
Abstract: The availability of continuous glucose monitors as over-the-counter commodities have created a unique opportunity to monitor a person's blood glucose levels, forecast blood glucose trajectories and provide automated interventions to prevent devastating chronic complications that arise from poor glucose control. However, forecasting blood glucose levels is challenging because blood glucose changes consistently in response to food intake, medication intake, physical activity, sleep, and stress. It is particularly difficult to accurately predict BGL from multimodal and irregularly sampled data and over long prediction horizons. Furthermore, these forecasting models must operate in real-time on edge devices to provide in-the-moment interventions. To address these challenges, we propose GlucoNet, an AI-powered sensor system for continuously monitoring behavioral and physiological health and robust forecasting of blood glucose patterns. GlucoNet devises a feature decomposition-based transformer model that incorporates patients' behavioral and physiological data and transforms sparse and irregular patient data (e.g., diet and medication intake data) into continuous features using a mathematical model, facilitating better integration with the BGL data. Given the non-linear and non-stationary nature of BG signals, we propose a decomposition method to extract both low and high-frequency components from the BGL signals, thus providing accurate forecasting. To reduce the computational complexity, we also propose to employ knowledge distillation to compress the transformer model. GlucoNet achieves a 60% improvement in RMSE and a 21% reduction in the number of parameters, improving RMSE and MAE by 51% and 57%, using data obtained involving 12 participants with T1-Diabetes. These results underscore GlucoNet's potential as a compact and reliable tool for real-world diabetes prevention and management.

Title: C-DiffSET: Leveraging Latent Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Image Translation with Confidence-Guided Reliable Object Generation
Authors: Jeonghyeok Do, Jaehyup Lee, Munchurl Kim
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imagery provides robust environmental and temporal coverage (e.g., during clouds, seasons, day-night cycles), yet its noise and unique structural patterns pose interpretation challenges, especially for non-experts. SAR-to-EO (Electro-Optical) image translation (SET) has emerged to make SAR images more perceptually interpretable. However, traditional approaches trained from scratch on limited SAR-EO datasets are prone to overfitting. To address these challenges, we introduce Confidence Diffusion for SAR-to-EO Translation, called C-DiffSET, a framework leveraging pretrained Latent Diffusion Model (LDM) extensively trained on natural images, thus enabling effective adaptation to the EO domain. Remarkably, we find that the pretrained VAE encoder aligns SAR and EO images in the same latent space, even with varying noise levels in SAR inputs. To further improve pixel-wise fidelity for SET, we propose a confidence-guided diffusion (C-Diff) loss that mitigates artifacts from temporal discrepancies, such as appearing or disappearing objects, thereby enhancing structural accuracy. C-DiffSET achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) results on multiple datasets, significantly outperforming the very recent image-to-image translation methods and SET methods with large margins.

Title: U-Motion: Learned Point Cloud Video Compression with U-Structured Motion Estimation
Authors: Tingyu Fan, Yueyu Hu, Yao Wang
Abstract: Point cloud video (PCV) is a versatile 3D representation of dynamic scenes with emerging applications. This paper introduces U-Motion, a learning-based compression scheme for both PCV geometry and attributes. We propose a U-Structured inter-frame prediction framework, U-Inter, which performs explicit motion estimation and compensation (ME/MC) at different scales with varying levels of detail. It integrates Top-Down (Fine-to-Coarse) Motion Propagation, Bottom-Up Motion Predictive Coding and Multi-scale Group Motion Compensation to enable accurate motion estimation and efficient motion compression at each scale. In addition, we design a multi-scale spatial-temporal predictive coding module to capture the cross-scale spatial redundancy remaining after U-Inter prediction. We conduct experiments following the MPEG Common Test Condition for dense dynamic point clouds and demonstrate that U-Motion can achieve significant gains over MPEG G-PCC-GesTM v3.0 and recently published learning-based methods for both geometry and attribute compression.

Title: Gotta Hear Them All: Sound Source Aware Vision to Audio Generation
Authors: Wei Guo, Heng Wang, Jianbo Ma, Weidong Cai
Abstract: Vision-to-audio (V2A) synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements of V2A methods have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs of videos or still images. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware V2A (SSV2A) generator. SSV2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to measure localized audio relevance. By addressing V2A generation at the sound-source level, SSV2A surpasses state-of-the-art methods in both generation fidelity and relevance as evidenced by extensive experiments. We further demonstrate SSV2A's ability to achieve intuitive V2A control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Our generation can be tried and heard at this https URL .

Title: Quantifying the Limits of Segmentation Foundation Models: Modeling Challenges in Segmenting Tree-Like and Low-Contrast Objects
Authors: Yixin Zhang, Nicholas Konz, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Image segmentation foundation models (SFMs) like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive zero-shot and interactive segmentation across diverse domains. However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (e.g., SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We link these failures to "textural confusion", where models misinterpret local structure as global texture, causing over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.

Title: Learning-based Control for Tendon-Driven Continuum Robotic Arms
Authors: Nima Maghooli, Omid Mahdizadeh, Mohammad Bajelani, S. Ali A. Moosavian
Abstract: This paper presents a learning-based approach for centralized position control of Tendon Driven Continuum Robots (TDCRs) using Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL), with a particular focus on the Sim-to-Real transfer of control policies. The proposed control method employs the Modified Transpose Jacobian (MTJ) control strategy, with its parameters optimally tuned using the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm. Classical model-based controllers encounter significant challenges due to the inherent uncertainties and nonlinear dynamics of continuum robots. In contrast, model-free control strategies require efficient gain-tuning to handle diverse operational scenarios. This research aims to develop a model-free controller with performance comparable to model-based strategies by integrating an optimal adaptive gain-tuning system. Both simulations and real-world implementations demonstrate that the proposed method significantly enhances the trajectory-tracking performance of continuum robots independent of initial conditions and paths within the operational task-space, effectively establishing a task-free controller.

Title: Look Inside for More: Internal Spatial Modality Perception for 3D Anomaly Detection
Authors: Hanzhe Liang, Guoyang Xie, Chengbin Hou, Bingshu Wang, Can Gao, Jinbao Wang
Abstract: 3D anomaly detection has recently become a significant focus in computer vision. Several advanced methods have achieved satisfying anomaly detection performance. However, they typically concentrate on the external structure of 3D samples and struggle to leverage the internal information embedded within samples. Inspired by the basic intuition of why not look inside for more, we introduce a straightforward method named Internal Spatial Modality Perception~(ISMP) to explore the feature representation from internal views fully. Specifically, our proposed ISMP consists of a critical perception module, Spatial Insight Engine~(SIE), which abstracts complex internal information of point clouds into essential global features. Besides, to better align structural information with point data, we propose an enhanced key point feature extraction module for amplifying spatial structure feature representation. Simultaneously, a novel feature filtering module is incorporated to reduce noise and redundant features for further aligning precise spatial structure. Extensive experiments validate the effectiveness of our proposed method, achieving object-level and pixel-level AUROC improvements of 3.2\% and 13.1\%, respectively, on the Real3D-AD benchmarks. Note that the strong generalization ability of SIE has been theoretically proven and is verified in both classification and segmentation tasks.

Title: TinySense: A Lighter Weight and More Power-efficient Avionics System for Flying Insect-scale Robots
Authors: Zhitao Yu, Joshua Tran, Claire Li, Aaron Weber, Yash P.Talwekar, Sawyer Fuller
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce advances in the sensor suite of an autonomous flying insect robot (FIR) weighing less than a gram. FIRs, because of their small weight and size, offer unparalleled advantages in terms of material cost and scalability. However, their size introduces considerable control challenges, notably high-speed dynamics, restricted power, and limited payload capacity. While there have been notable advancements in developing lightweight sensors, often drawing inspiration from biological systems, no sub-gram aircraft has been able to attain sustained hover without relying on feedback from external sensing such as a motion capture system. The lightest vehicle capable of sustained hovering -- the first level of ``sensor autonomy'' -- is the much larger 28 g Crazyflie. Previous work reported a reduction in size of that vehicle's avionics suite to 187 mg and 21 mW. Here, we report a further reduction in mass and power to only 78.4 mg and 15 mW. We replaced the laser rangefinder with a lighter and more efficient pressure sensor, and built a smaller optic flow sensor around a global-shutter imaging chip. A Kalman Filter (KF) fuses these measurements to estimate the state variables that are needed to control hover: pitch angle, translational velocity, and altitude. Our system achieved performance comparable to that of the Crazyflie's estimator while in flight, with root mean squared errors of 1.573 deg, 0.186 m/s, and 0.136 m, respectively, relative to motion capture.

Title: DLEN: Dual Branch of Transformer for Low-Light Image Enhancement in Dual Domains
Authors: Junyu Xia, Jiesong Bai, Yihang Dong
Abstract: Low-light image enhancement (LLE) aims to improve the visual quality of images captured in poorly lit conditions, which often suffer from low brightness, low contrast, noise, and color distortions. These issues hinder the performance of computer vision tasks such as object detection, facial recognition, and autonomous this http URL enhancement techniques, such as multi-scale fusion and histogram equalization, fail to preserve fine details and often struggle with maintaining the natural appearance of enhanced images under complex lighting conditions. Although the Retinex theory provides a foundation for image decomposition, it often amplifies noise, leading to suboptimal image quality. In this paper, we propose the Dual Light Enhance Network (DLEN), a novel architecture that incorporates two distinct attention mechanisms, considering both spatial and frequency domains. Our model introduces a learnable wavelet transform module in the illumination estimation phase, preserving high- and low-frequency components to enhance edge and texture details. Additionally, we design a dual-branch structure that leverages the power of the Transformer architecture to enhance both the illumination and structural components of the this http URL extensive experiments, our model outperforms state-of-the-art methods on standard this http URL is available here: this https URL

Title: KAD: No More FAD! An Effective and Efficient Evaluation Metric for Audio Generation
Authors: Yoonjin Chung, Pilsun Eu, Junwon Lee, Keunwoo Choi, Juhan Nam, Ben Sangbae Chon
Abstract: Although being widely adopted for evaluating generated audio signals, the Fr√©chet Audio Distance (FAD) suffers from significant limitations, including reliance on Gaussian assumptions, sensitivity to sample size, and high computational complexity. As an alternative, we introduce the Kernel Audio Distance (KAD), a novel, distribution-free, unbiased, and computationally efficient metric based on Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD). Through analysis and empirical validation, we demonstrate KAD's advantages: (1) faster convergence with smaller sample sizes, enabling reliable evaluation with limited data; (2) lower computational cost, with scalable GPU acceleration; and (3) stronger alignment with human perceptual judgments. By leveraging advanced embeddings and characteristic kernels, KAD captures nuanced differences between real and generated audio. Open-sourced in the kadtk toolkit, KAD provides an efficient, reliable, and perceptually aligned benchmark for evaluating generative audio models.

Title: Clip-TTS: Contrastive Text-content and Mel-spectrogram, A High-Quality Text-to-Speech Method based on Contextual Semantic Understanding
Authors: Tianyun Liu
Abstract: Traditional text-to-speech (TTS) methods primarily focus on establishing a mapping between phonemes and mel-spectrograms. However, during the phoneme encoding stage, there is often a lack of real mel-spectrogram auxiliary information, which results in the encoding process lacking true semantic understanding. At the same time, traditional TTS systems often struggle to balance the inference speed of the model with the quality of the synthesized speech. Methods that generate high-quality synthesized speech tend to have slower inference speeds, while faster inference methods often sacrifice speech quality. In this paper, I propose Clip-TTS, a TTS method based on the Clip architecture. This method uses the Clip framework to establish a connection between text content and real mel-spectrograms during the text encoding stage, enabling the text encoder to directly learn the true semantics of the global context, thereby ensuring the quality of the synthesized speech. In terms of model architecture, I adopt the basic structure of Transformer, which allows Clip-TTS to achieve fast inference speeds. Experimental results show that on the LJSpeech and Baker datasets, the speech generated by Clip-TTS achieves state-of-the-art MOS scores, and it also performs excellently on multi-emotion this http URL samples are available at: this https URL.

Title: Robust time series generation via Schr√∂dinger Bridge: a comprehensive evaluation
Authors: Alexandre Alouadi, Baptiste Barreau, Laurent Carlier, Huy√™n Pham
Abstract: We investigate the generative capabilities of the Schr√∂dinger Bridge (SB) approach for time series. The SB framework formulates time series synthesis as an entropic optimal interpolation transport problem between a reference probability measure on path space and a target joint distribution. This results in a stochastic differential equation over a finite horizon that accurately captures the temporal dynamics of the target time series. While the SB approach has been largely explored in fields like image generation, there is a scarcity of studies for its application to time series. In this work, we bridge this gap by conducting a comprehensive evaluation of the SB method's robustness and generative performance. We benchmark it against state-of-the-art (SOTA) time series generation methods across diverse datasets, assessing its strengths, limitations, and capacity to model complex temporal dependencies. Our results offer valuable insights into the SB framework's potential as a versatile and robust tool for time series generation.

Title: Digital Twin-Enabled Blockage-Aware Dynamic mmWave Multi-Hop V2X Communication
Authors: Supat Roongpraiwan, Zongdian Li, Tao Yu, Kei Sakaguchi
Abstract: Millimeter wave (mmWave) technology in vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication offers unprecedented data rates and low latency, but faces significant reliability challenges due to signal blockages and limited range. This paper introduces a novel system for managing dynamic multi-hop mmWave V2X communications in complex blocking environments. We present a system architecture that integrates a mobility digital twin (DT) with the multi-hop routing control plane, providing a comprehensive, real-time view of the network and its surrounding traffic environment. This integration enables the control plane to make informed routing decisions based on rich contextual data about vehicles, infrastructure, and potential signal blockages. Leveraging this DT-enhanced architecture, we propose an advanced routing algorithm that combines high-precision environmental data with trajectory prediction to achieve blockage-aware mmWave multi-hop V2X routing. Our algorithm anticipates network topology changes and adapts topology dynamically to maintain reliable connections. We evaluate our approach through proof-of-concept simulations using a mobility DT of the Nishishinjuku area. Results demonstrate that our DT-enabled routing strategy significantly outperforms conventional methods in maintaining reliable mmWave V2X connections across various traffic scenarios, including fully connected and mixed traffic environments.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at this https URL.
