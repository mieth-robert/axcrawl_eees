Title: Structured Analytic Mappings for Point Set Registration
Authors: Wei Feng, Tengda Wei, Haiyong Zheng
Abstract: We present an analytic approximation model for non-rigid point set registration, grounded in the multivariate Taylor expansion of vector-valued functions. By exploiting the algebraic structure of Taylor expansions, we construct a structured function space spanned by truncated basis terms, allowing smooth deformations to be represented with low complexity and explicit form. To estimate mappings within this space, we develop a quasi-Newton optimization algorithm that progressively lifts the identity map into higher-order analytic forms. This structured framework unifies rigid, affine, and nonlinear deformations under a single closed-form formulation, without relying on kernel functions or high-dimensional parameterizations. The proposed model is embedded into a standard ICP loop -- using (by default) nearest-neighbor correspondences -- resulting in Analytic-ICP, an efficient registration algorithm with quasi-linear time complexity. Experiments on 2D and 3D datasets demonstrate that Analytic-ICP achieves higher accuracy and faster convergence than classical methods such as CPD and TPS-RPM, particularly for small and smooth deformations.

Title: Low-Thrust Trajectory Optimization for Cubesat Lunar Mission: HORYU-VI
Authors: Omer Burak Iskender, Keck Voon Ling, Mengu Cho, Sangkyun Kim, Necmi Cihan Orger
Abstract: This paper presents a low-thrust trajectory optimization strategy to achieve a near-circular lunar orbit for a CubeSat injected into a lunar flyby trajectory. The 12U CubeSat HORYU-VI is equipped with four Hall-effect thrusters and designed as a secondary payload on NASA's Space Launch System under the Artemis program. Upon release, the spacecraft gains sufficient energy to escape the Earth-Moon system after a lunar flyby. The proposed trajectory is decomposed into three phases: (1) pre-flyby deceleration to avoid heliocentric escape, (2) lunar gravitational capture, and (3) orbit circularization to the science orbit. For each phase, an impulsive-burn solution is first computed as an initial guess, which is then refined through finite-burn optimization using Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP). The dynamical model incorporates Earth-Moon-Sun-Jupiter gravitational interactions and a high-fidelity lunar gravity field. All trajectories are independently verified with NASA's General Mission Analysis Tool (GMAT). Results demonstrate that HORYU-VI achieves lunar capture within 200 days, establishes a stable science orbit at 280 days, and can spiral down to a near-circular 100 km orbit by 450 days, using a total Delta-V of 710 m/s, well within the capability of the electric propulsion system.

Title: A New Perspective on Scale: A Novel Transform for NMR Envelope Extraction
Authors: Ehsun Assadi
Abstract: Envelope extraction in nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) is a fundamental step for processing the data space generated by this technique. Envelope detection accuracy improves with increasing the number of sampling points; however, we propose a novel transform that enables acceptable envelope extraction with significantly fewer sampling points, even without meeting the Nyquist rate. In this paper, we challenge the traditional scale definition and demonstrate that classic scaling lacks a physical referent in all situations. To achieve this aim, we introduce a scale based on the variations of space-invariant states, rather than the observable characteristics of matter and energy. According to this definition of the scale, we distinguished two kinds of observers: scale-variant and scale-invariant. We demonstrated that converting a scale-variant observer to a scale-invariant observer is equivalent to envelop extraction. To analyse and study the theories presented in the paper, we have designed and implemented an Earth-field NMR setup and used real data generated by it to evaluate the performance of the proposed envelope-detection transform. We compared the output of the proposed transform with that of classic and state-of-the-art methods for parameter recovery of NMR signals.

Title: Odor Communication with Green Leaf Volatiles for Stress Signalling in the Internet of Plants
Authors: Fatih Merdan, Ozgur B. Akan
Abstract: This paper develops an end-to-end odor communication model for stress signaling between plants using Green Leaf Volatiles (GLV). A damaged transmitter plant emits (Z)-3-hexenal, (Z)-3-hexenol, and (Z)-3-hexenyl acetate, which propagate through a time-varying diffusion-advection channel and undergo multiplicative loss at the receiver. The sink plant is modeled with a biochemical receiver network that converts the received GLVs into the defensive metabolite (Z)-3-hexenyl $\beta$-vicianoside, and an alarm decision is defined based on its concentration level. Numerical results show that (Z)-3-hexenol is the primary driver of the system and that plant perception generally operates in a non-linear region. These findings provide a framework for understanding the evolution of plant-plant communication and for developing next-generation precision farming technologies.

Title: BrainRVQ: A High-Fidelity EEG Foundation Model via Dual-Domain Residual Quantization and Hierarchical Autoregression
Authors: Mingzhe Cui, Tao Chen, Yang Jiao, Yiqin Wang, Lei Xie, Yi Pan, Luca Mainardi
Abstract: Developing foundation models for electroencephalography (EEG) remains challenging due to the signal's low signal-to-noise ratio and complex spectro-temporal non-stationarity. Existing approaches often overlook the hierarchical latent structure inherent in neural dynamics, leading to suboptimal reconstruction of fine-grained information. In this work, we propose BrainRVQ, a general-purpose EEG foundation model pre-trained on a large-scale corpus of clinical EEG data. Unlike standard masked modeling, BrainRVQ features a Dual-Domain Residual Vector Quantization (DD-RVQ) tokenizer that disentangles temporal waveforms and spectral patterns into hierarchical discrete codes. We further introduce a hierarchical autoregressive pre-training objective that learns to reconstruct these codes in a coarse-to-fine manner, utilizing an importance-guided curriculum masking strategy to prioritize information-rich neural events over background noise. Extensive experiments across 8 diverse downstream datasets demonstrate that BrainRVQ consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines, validating its effectiveness in learning robust and generalizable neural representations.

Title: Covert Routing with DSSS Signaling Against Cycle Detectors
Authors: Swapnil Saha, Rahul Aggarwal, Fikadu Dagefu, Justin Kong, Jihun Choi, Brian Kim, Predrag Spasojevic
Abstract: This paper investigates covert multi-hop communication in wireless networks where an adversary employs a cyclostationary (cycle) detector to reveal hidden transmissions. The covert route employs direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) signaling to ensure either maximum end-to-end covertness maximization or minimum latency minimization-under quality-of-service (QoS) and link budget constraints. Optimal bandwidth, transmit power, and spreading gain for each hop jointly satisfy reliability and either rate or covertness requirements. We show the equivalence between the covertness and the detection SNR gain-based widest-path formulations, and, hence, enabling efficient route computation. Numerical simulations in a realistic 3D environment illustrate that (i) end-to-end latency increases exponentially with the covertness requirement, (ii) the end-to-end latency increase is super-linear with the packet size M, and (iii) cycle and energy detectors impose different latency behavior as a function of the message length and the covertness requirement. The proposed framework provides important insights into resource allocation and routing design for covert networks against advanced detection adversaries.

Title: Is there a relationship between Mean Opinion Score (MOS) and Just Noticeable Difference (JND)?
Authors: Jingwen Zhu, Hadi Amirpour, Wei Zhou, Patrick Le Callet
Abstract: Evaluating perceived video quality is essential for ensuring high Quality of Experience (QoE) in modern streaming applications. While existing subjective datasets and Video Quality Metrics (VQMs) cover a broad quality range, many practical use cases especially for premium users focus on high quality scenarios requiring finer granularity. Just Noticeable Difference (JND) has emerged as a key concept for modeling perceptual thresholds in these high end regions and plays an important role in perceptual bitrate ladder construction. However, the relationship between JND and the more widely used Mean Opinion Score (MOS) remains unclear. In this paper, we conduct a Degradation Category Rating (DCR) subjective study based on an existing JND dataset to examine how MOS corresponds to the 75% Satisfied User Ratio (SUR) points of the 1st and 2nd JNDs. We find that while MOS values at JND points generally align with theoretical expectations (e.g., 4.75 for the 75% SUR of the 1st JND), the reverse mapping from MOS to JND is ambiguous due to overlapping confidence intervals across PVS indices. Statistical significance analysis further shows that DCR studies with limited participants may not detect meaningful differences between reference and JND videos.

Title: Beyond Average-Channel-Based Rate Approximations: UAV Trajectory and Scheduling Optimization With Expected Rate Consideration
Authors: Gitae Park, Kisong Lee
Abstract: This paper investigates the joint optimization of trajectory, user scheduling, and time-slot duration in unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted wireless communication systems under minimum expected spectral efficiency (SE) constraints. Unlike most existing studies that approximate the expected SE by substituting the random channel gain with its mean value, thereby evaluating the SE at the average channel realization and overestimating the true expected SE due to Jensen's inequality, we approximate the expected SE by numerically integrating the SE over the channel distributions. Specifically, instead of relying on average-channel-based approximations, we develop a conservative yet tractable quadrature-based approximation by discretizing the associated cumulative distribution functions. The resulting finite-sum representation explicitly accounts for the probabilistic LoS structure and channel fading effects, while remaining tractable for optimization. Leveraging this lower bound, we formulate a mission completion time minimization problem subject to minimum expected-SE requirements for all ground nodes. The resulting problem is a mixed-integer nonconvex optimization, which is tackled via a penalty-based block coordinate descent framework. The proposed algorithm alternately optimizes the scheduling decisions and the UAV trajectory along with adaptive time-slot durations, and maintains feasibility with respect to the original expected-SE constraints by leveraging successive convex approximation and quadratic transform techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method strictly satisfies the minimum expected-SE constraints and achieves a significantly shorter mission completion time than conventional average-channel-based approaches, which are shown to yield infeasible or overly conservative solutions.

Title: Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part I: Traffic-Aware Case
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Zhiguo Ding, Xiu Yin Zhang, Trung Q. Duong, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: Existing studies on generalized pinching-antenna systems are predominantly link-level, which optimize system parameters for a given user set with objectives defined by per-user performance metrics. Such designs do not capture network-level requirements, e.g., region-wide coverage and location fairness, and may require frequent re-optimization as users move or enter/leave, incurring control overhead and sensitivity to localization errors. Motivated by this gap, this two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems. Part I focuses on the traffic-aware case, where user presence is modeled statistically by a spatial traffic map and performance is optimized and evaluated in a traffic-aware sense; Part II addresses the geometry-aware case in obstacle-rich environments. In Part~I, we introduce traffic-weighted average SNR metrics and formulate two traffic-aware deployment problems: (i) maximizing the traffic-weighted network average SNR, and (ii) a fairness-oriented traffic-restricted max--min average-SNR design over traffic-dominant grids. To solve these nonconvex problems with low complexity, we reveal and exploit their separable structures. For the network-average objective, we establish unimodality properties of the hotspot-induced components and develop a candidate-based global maximization method that only needs to evaluate the objective at a small set of candidate antenna positions. For the traffic-restricted max--min objective, we develop a block coordinate decent framework where each coordinate update reduces to a globally solvable one-dimensional subproblem via an epigraph reformulation and bisection. Simulations show that traffic-aware pinching-antenna positioning consistently outperforms representative fixed and heuristic traffic-aware deployments in the considered setups.

Title: Environment-Aware Network-Level Design of Generalized Pinching-Antenna Systems--Part II: Geometry-Aware Case
Authors: Yanqing Xu, Zhiguo Ding, Xiu Yin Zhang, Trung Q. Duong, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: This two-part paper aims to develop an environment-aware network-level design framework for generalized pinching-antenna systems to overcome the limitations of conventional link-level optimization, which is tightly coupled to instantaneous user geometry and thus sensitive to user mobility and localization errors. Part I investigates the traffic-aware case, where user presence is characterized statistically by a spatial traffic map and deployments are optimized using traffic-aware network-level metrics. Part II complements Part I by developing geometry-aware, blockage-aware network optimization for pinching-antenna systems in obstacle-rich environments. We introduce a grid-level average signal-to-noise (SNR) model with a deterministic LoS visibility indicator and a discrete activation architecture, where the geometry-dependent terms are computed offline in advance. Building on this model, we formulate two network-level activation problems: (i) average-SNR-threshold coverage maximization and (ii) fairness-oriented worst-grid average-SNR maximization. On the algorithmic side, we prove the coverage problem is NP-hard and derive an equivalent mix-integer linear programming reformulation through binary coverage variables and linear SNR linking constraints. To achieve scalability, we further develop a structure-exploiting coordinate-ascent method that updates one waveguide at a time using precomputed per-candidate SNR contributions. For the worst-grid objective, we adopt an epigraph reformulation and leverage the resulting monotone feasibility in the target SNR, enabling an efficient bisection-based solver with low-complexity feasibility checks over the discrete candidate set. Simulations results validate the proposed designs and quantify their gains under different environments and system parameters.

Title: Decoupled Internal Energy Regulation and Inertial Response Provision for Grid-Forming Multilevel-Converter-Based E-STATCOMs
Authors: Ki-Hyun Kim, Yeongung Kim, Shenghui Cui, Jae-Jung Jung
Abstract: As power systems accommodate higher shares of renewable generation, short-term power imbalances become more frequent and can manifest as pronounced voltage and frequency excursions under low-inertia conditions. E-STATCOMs (STATCOMs equipped with energy storage) offer a practical means to provide both voltage support and fast frequency assistance under grid-forming control. Among candidate implementations, double-star multilevel-converter (DS-MC)-based E-STATCOMs enable centralized energy-storage integration at the dc link, which improves thermal management and maintainability. Nevertheless, conventional dc-side power-based internal-energy regulation in DS-MCs can undesirably couple loss compensation to the energy-storage path, accelerating storage cycling and constraining operation when the storage is unavailable. This paper introduces a control strategy that assigns DS-MC total internal-energy regulation to the ac-side active-power path, while reserving dc-side storage power solely for frequency support. By decoupling internal-energy management from inertial-response provision, the proposed scheme enables flexible operation as either a STATCOM or an E-STATCOM according to storage availability and mitigates unnecessary storage cycling. The proposed strategy is verified through offline simulations and laboratory-scale experiments.

Title: Validation of KESTREL EMT for Industrial Capacitor Switching Transient Studies
Authors: Shankar Ramharack, Rajiv Sahadeo
Abstract: Electromagnetic transient (EMT) simulation is essential for analyzing sub-cycle switching phenomena in industrial power systems; however, commercial EMT platforms present significant cost barriers for smaller utilities, consultancies, and academic institutions, particularly in developing regions. This paper validates KESTREL EMT, a free and open-source electromagnetic transient solver with Python integration, through three progressive case studies involving industrial capacitor switching transients. This work investigates energization, switching resonance and VFD interactions with capacitor banks. The results demonstrate that KESTREL, when supported by appropriate circuit modeling techniques, produces EMT responses consistent with analytical predictions and established IEEE benchmarks. This work establishes a validated and reproducible methodology for conducting industrial EMT studies using freely available, open-source tools.

Title: HybridPrompt: Bridging Generative Priors and Traditional Codecs for Mobile Streaming
Authors: Liming Liu, Jiangkai Wu, Haoyang Wang, Peiheng Wang, Zongming Guo, Xinggong Zhang
Abstract: In Video on Demand (VoD) scenarios, traditional codecs are the industry standard due to their high decoding efficiency. However, they suffer from severe quality degradation under low bandwidth conditions. While emerging generative neural codecs offer significantly higher perceptual quality, their reliance on heavy frame-by-frame generation makes real-time playback on mobile devices impractical. We ask: is it possible to combine the blazing-fast speed of traditional standards with the superior visual fidelity of neural approaches? We present HybridPrompt, the first generative-based video system capable of achieving real-time 1080p decoding at over 150 FPS on a commercial smartphone. Specifically, we employ a hybrid architecture that encodes Keyframes using a generative model while relying on traditional codecs for the remaining frames. A major challenge is that the two paradigms have conflicting objectives: the "hallucinated" details from generative models often misalign with the rigid prediction mechanisms of traditional codecs, causing bitrate inefficiency. To address this, we demonstrate that the traditional decoding process is differentiable, enabling an end-to-end optimization loop. This allows us to use subsequent frames as additional supervision, forcing the generative model to synthesize keyframes that are not only perceptually high-fidelity but also mathematically optimal references for the traditional codec. By integrating a two-stage generation strategy, our system outperforms pure neural baselines by orders of magnitude in speed while achieving an average LPIPS gain of 8% over traditional codecs at 200kbps.

Title: Assessing Ionospheric Scintillation Risk for Direct-to-Cellular Communications using Frequency-Scaled GNSS Observations
Authors: Abdollah Masoud Darya, Muhammad Mubasshir Shaikh
Abstract: One of the key issues facing Direct-to-Cellular (D2C) satellite communication systems is ionospheric scintillation on the uplink and downlink, which can significantly degrade link quality. This work investigates the spatial and temporal characteristics of amplitude scintillation at D2C frequencies by scaling L-band scintillation observations from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) receivers to bands relevant to D2C operation, including the low-band, and 3GPP's N255 and N256. These observations are then compared to scaled radio-occultation scintillation observations from the FORMOSAT-7/COSMIC-2 (F7/C2) mission, which can be used in regions that do not possess ground-based scintillation monitoring stations. As a proof of concept, five years of ground-based GNSS scintillation data from Sharjah, United Arab Emirates, together with two years of F7/C2 observations over the same region, corresponding to the ascending phase of Solar Cycle 25, are analyzed. Both space-based and ground-based observations indicate a pronounced diurnal scintillation peak between 20--22 local time, particularly during the equinoxes, with occurrence rates increasing with solar activity. Ground-based observations also reveal a strong azimuth dependence, with most scintillation events occurring on southward satellite links. The scintillation occurrence rate at the low-band is more than twice that observed at N255 and N256, highlighting the increased robustness of higher D2C bands to ionospheric scintillation. These results demonstrate how GNSS scintillation observations can be leveraged to characterize and anticipate scintillation-induced D2C link impairments, which help in D2C system design and the implementation of scintillation mitigation strategies.

Title: CC-G2PnP: Streaming Grapheme-to-Phoneme and prosody with Conformer-CTC for unsegmented languages
Authors: Yuma Shirahata, Ryuichi Yamamoto
Abstract: We propose CC-G2PnP, a streaming grapheme-to-phoneme and prosody (G2PnP) model to connect large language model and text-to-speech in a streaming manner. CC-G2PnP is based on Conformer-CTC architecture. Specifically, the input grapheme tokens are processed chunk by chunk, which enables streaming inference of phonemic and prosodic (PnP) labels. By guaranteeing minimal look-ahead size to each input token, the proposed model can consider future context in each token, which leads to stable PnP label prediction. Unlike previous streaming methods that depend on explicit word boundaries, the CTC decoder in CC-G2PnP effectively learns the alignment between graphemes and phonemes during training, making it applicable to unsegmented languages. Experiments on a Japanese dataset, which has no explicit word boundaries, show that CC-G2PnP significantly outperforms the baseline streaming G2PnP model in the accuracy of PnP label prediction.

Title: Secure Task Offloading and Resource Allocation Design for Multi-Layer Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Alejandro Flores, Isabella W. G. da Silva, Vu Nguyen Ha, Konstantinos Ntontin, Hien Quoc Ngo, Michail Matthaiou, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Remote and resource-constrained Internet-of-Things (IoT) deployments often lack terrestrial connectivity for task offloading, motivating non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) with onboard multiaccess edge computing (MEC) capabilities. Nevertheless, in the presence of malicious actors, authentication needs to be performed to avoid non-authorized nodes from draining the computing resources of the NTN nodes. As a solution, we propose a four-layer MEC-enabled NTN with unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) acting as access nodes, a high altitude platform station (HAPS) acting as coordinator and authenticator, and a constellation of low-Earth orbit satellites (LEOSats) acting as remote MEC servers. We consider a tag-based physical-layer authentication (PLA) scheme to authenticate legitimate users, and formulate a joint task offloading decision and resource allocation for the admitted tasks, which is solved via block coordinate descent. Numerical results show that the PLA scheme is efficient and performs better than the benchmark schemes. We also demonstrate that the proposed scheme is robust against malicious attacks even under relaxed false-alarm constraints.

Title: A Novel Near-Field Dictionary Design for Hybrid MIMO with Uniform Planar Arrays
Authors: Luca Antonelli, Antonio Alberto D Amico, Luca Sanguinetti
Abstract: Near-field ultra-massive MIMO (U-MIMO) systems provide enhanced spatial resolution but present challenges for channel estimation, particularly when hybrid architectures are employed. Within this framework, dictionary-based channel estimation schemes are needed to achieve accurate reconstruction from a reduced set of measurements. However, existing near-field dictionaries generally provide full three-dimensional coverage, which is unnecessary when user equipments are primarily located on the ground. In this paper, we propose a novel near-field grid design tailored to this common scenario. Specifically, grid points lie on a reference plane located at an arbitrary height with respect to the U-MIMO system, equipped with a uniform planar array. Furthermore, a channel accuracy metric is used to improve codebook performance, and to remark the limitations of the traditional far-field angular sampling in the near field. Results show that, as long as user equipments are not far from the reference plane, the proposed grid outperforms state-of-the-art designs in both channel estimation accuracy and spectral efficiency.

Title: Distributionally Robust Scheduling of Electrified Heating Under Heat Demand Forecast Uncertainty
Authors: Alessandro Quattrociocchi, Manisha Talukdar, Pere Izquierdo Gómez, Tomislav Dragicevic
Abstract: Electrified heating systems with thermal storage, such as electric boilers and heat pumps, represent a major source of demand-side flexibility. Under current electricity market designs, balance responsible parties (BRPs) operating such assets are required to submit binding day-ahead electricity consumption schedules, and they typically do it based on forecasts of heat demand and electricity prices. Common scheduling approaches implicitly assume that forecast uncertainty can be well characterized using historical forecast errors. In practice, however, the cumulative effect of uncertainty creates significant exposure to imbalance-price risk when the committed schedule cannot be followed. To address this, we propose a distributionally robust chance-constrained optimization framework for the day-ahead scheduling of a multi-MW electric boiler using only limited residual forecast samples. We derive a tractable convex reformulation of the problem and calibrate the ambiguity set directly from historical forecast-error data through an a priori tunable risk parameter. Numerical results show that enforcing performance guarantees on the heat-demand balance constraint reduces demand violations by 40% compared to a deterministic forecast-based scheduler and up to 10% relative to a nominal chance-constrained model with a fixed error distribution. Further, we show that modeling the real-time rebound cost of demand violations as a second-stage term can reduce the overall daily operating cost by up to 34% by hedging against highly volatile day-ahead electricity prices.

Title: On the Value of Base Station Motion Knowledge for Goal-Oriented Remote Monitoring with Energy-Harvesting Sensors
Authors: Sehani Siriwardana, Jean Michel de Souza Sant'Ana, Richard Demo Souza, Abolfazl Zakeri, Onel Luis Alcaraz López
Abstract: This paper investigates goal-oriented remote monitoring of an unobservable Markov source using energy-harvesting sensors that communicate with a mobile receiver, such as a Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite or Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV). Unlike conventional systems that assume stationary base stations, the proposed framework explicitly accounts for receiver mobility, which induces time-varying channel characteristics modeled as a finite-state Markov process. The remote monitoring problem is formulated as a partially observable Markov decision process (POMDP), which is transformed into a tractable belief-state MDP and solved using relative value iteration to obtain optimal sampling and transmission policies. Two estimation strategies are considered: Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Minimum Mean Distortion (MMD). Numerical results demonstrate that incorporating receiver mobility and channel state information into the optimization reduces the average distortion by 10% to 42% compared to baseline policies and constant-channel assumptions, highlighting the importance of base station motion knowledge for effective goal-oriented communication.

Title: Failure Detection for Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Chongjun Ouyang, Hao Jiang, Zhaolin Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: A signal processing-based framework is proposed for detecting random segment failures in segmented waveguide-enabled pinching-antenna systems. To decouple the passively combined uplink signal and to provide per-segment observability, tagged pilots are employed. A simple tag is attached to each segment and is used to apply a known low-rate modulation at the segment feed, which assigns a unique signature to each segment. Based on the tagged-pilot model, a low-complexity per-segment maximum-likelihood (ML) detector is developed for the case in which the pilot length is no smaller than the number of segments. For the case in which the pilot length is smaller than the number of segments, sparsity in the failure-indicator vector is exploited and a compressive sensing-based detector is adopted. Numerical results show that the per-segment detector approaches joint ML performance, while the compressive sensing-based detector achieves reliable detection with a short pilot and can outperform baselines that require much longer pilots.

Title: Gaussian surrogates do well on Poisson inverse problems
Authors: Alexandra Spitzer, Lorenzo Baldassari, Valentin Derbanot, Ivan Dokmanić
Abstract: In imaging inverse problems with Poisson-distributed measurements, it is common to use objectives derived from the Poisson likelihood. But performance is often evaluated by mean squared error (MSE), which raises a practical question: how much does a Poisson objective matter for MSE, even at low dose? We analyze the MSE of Poisson and Gaussian surrogate reconstruction objectives under Poisson noise. In a stylized diagonal model, we show that the unregularized Poisson maximum-likelihood estimator can incur large MSE at low dose, while Poisson MAP mitigates this instability through regularization. We then study two Gaussian surrogate objectives: a heteroscedastic quadratic objective motivated by the normal approximation of Poisson data, and a homoscedastic quadratic objective that yields a simple linear estimator. We show that both surrogates can achieve MSE comparable to Poisson MAP in the low-dose regime, despite departing from the Poisson likelihood. Numerical computed tomography experiments indicate that these conclusions extend beyond the stylized setting of our theoretical analysis.

Title: Learning-based augmentation of first-principle models: A linear fractional representation-based approach
Authors: Jan H. Hoekstra, Bendegúz M. Györök, Roland Tóth, Maarten Schoukens
Abstract: Nonlinear system identificationhas proven to be effective in obtaining accurate models from data for complex real-world systems. In particular, recent encoder-based methods with artificial neural network state-space (ANN-SS) models have achieved state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks, using computationally efficient methods and offering consistent model estimation in the presence of noisy data. However, inclusion of prior knowledge of the system can be further exploited to increase (i) estimation speed, (ii) accuracy, and (iii) interpretability of the resulting models. This paper proposes a model augmentation method that incorporates prior knowledge from first-principles (FP) models in a flexible manner. We introduce a novel linear-fractional-representation (LFR) model structure that allows for the general representation of various augmentation structures including the ones that are commonly used in the literature, and an encoder-based identification algorithm for estimating the proposed structures together with appropriate initialisation methods. The performance and generalisation capabilities of the proposed method are demonstrated on the identification of a hardening mass-spring-damper system in a simulation study and on the data-driven modelling of the dynamics of an F1Tenth electric car using measured data.

Title: Herd Behavior in Decentralized Balancing Models: A Case Study in Belgium
Authors: Max Bruninx, Seyed Soroush Karimi Madahi, Timothy Verstraeten, Jan Decuyper, Chris Develder, Jan Helsen
Abstract: In a decentralized balancing model, Balance Responsible Parties (BRPs) are encouraged by the Transmission System Operator (TSO) to deviate from their schedule to help the system restore balance, also referred to as implicit balancing. This could reduce balancing costs for the grid operator and lower the entry barrier for flexible assets compared to explicit balancing services. However, these implicit reactions may overshoot when their total capacity is high, potentially requiring more explicit activations. This study analyses the effect of increased participation in the decentralized balancing model in Belgium. To this end, we develop a market simulator that produces price signals on minute-level and simulate the implicit reactions for battery assets with different risk profiles. Besides the current price formula, we also study two potential candidates for the near-term presented by the TSO. A simulation study is conducted using Belgian market data for the year 2023. The findings indicate that, while having a significant positive effect on the balancing costs at first, the risk of overshoots can outweigh the potential benefits when the total capacity of the implicit reactions becomes too large. Furthermore, even when the balancing costs start to increase for the TSO, BRPs were still found to benefit from implicit balancing.

Title: Robust Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Interval Matrix Model Uncertainty
Authors: Renato Quartullo, Andrea Garulli, Mirko Leomanni
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel robust Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems affected by model uncertainty described by interval matrices. The key feature of the proposed method is a bound on the uncertainty propagation along the prediction horizon which exploits a set-theoretic over-approximation of each term of the uncertain system impulse response. Such an approximation is based on matrix zonotopes and leverages the interval matrix structure of the uncertainty model. Its main advantage is that all the relevant bounds are computed offline, thus making the online computational load independent of the number of uncertain parameters. A variable-horizon MPC formulation is adopted to guarantee recursive feasibility and to ensure robust asymptotic stability of the closed-loop system. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach is able to match the feasibility regions of the most effective state-of-the-art methods, while significantly reducing the computational burden, thereby enabling the treatment of nontrivial dimensional systems with multiple uncertain parameters.

Title: Secrecy Rate Maximization in RIS-Assisted MIMO Systems Using a Practical Hardware Model
Authors: Rakesh Ranjan, Ahmad Sirojuddin, Manjesh K. Hanawal, Himanshu B. Mishra, Wan-Jen Huang ID
Abstract: This study investigates a robust reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system for secure wireless communication, in which a multi-antenna transmitter (Alice) sends confidential messages to a multi-antenna receiver (Bob) in the presence of an eavesdropper (Eve). Unlike idealized models, the reflecting elements (REs) of the RIS are assumed to possess inherent electrical resistance, introducing a practical non-ideal effect often neglected in prior research. The aim of the study is to maximize the secrecy rate of the MIMO system under perfect knowledge of the channel state information (CSI). To achieve this, the secrecy rate maximization problem is formulated and solved using a low-complexity joint optimization framework based on an adaptive projected gradient method (PGM), which simultaneously updates both the transmit precoding matrix and the RIS phase shifts. Solving the exact problem is computationally complex. Thus, a simplified variant is further introduced that maximizes the channel power difference rather than the exact secrecy rate. The simulation results show that this approximation yields a secrecy rate close to the true optimum while significantly reducing the computational cost. In addition, the proposed PGM with an adaptive step size initialization and control mechanism substantially improves the secrecy rate and reduces the computational time compared to the conventional fixed step size PGM. Overall, the simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed PGM and demonstrate that adopting a practical RIS model is essential for establishing secure RIS-assisted MIMO communication links, especially under varying RE resistance values.

Title: Bluetooth Phased-array Aided Inertial Navigation Using Factor Graphs: Experimental Verification
Authors: Glen Hjelmerud Mørkbak Sørensen, Torleiv H. Bryne, Kristoffer Gryte, Tor Arne Johansen
Abstract: Phased-array Bluetooth systems have emerged as a low-cost alternative for performing aided inertial navigation in GNSS-denied use cases such as warehouse logistics, drone landings, and autonomous docking. Basing a navigation system off of commercial-off-the-shelf components may reduce the barrier of entry for phased-array radio navigation systems, albeit at the cost of significantly noisier measurements and relatively short feasible range. In this paper, we compare robust estimation strategies for a factor graph optimisation-based estimator using experimental data collected from multirotor drone flight. We evaluate performance in loss-of-GNSS scenarios when aided by Bluetooth angular measurements, as well as range or barometric pressure.

Title: Multi-Agent Temporal Logic Planning via Penalty Functions and Block-Coordinate Optimization
Authors: Eleftherios E. Vlahakis, Arash Bahari Kordabad, Lars Lindemann, Pantelis Sopasakis, Sadegh Soudjani, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: Multi-agent planning under Signal Temporal Logic (STL) is often hindered by collaborative tasks that lead to computational challenges due to the inherent high-dimensionality of the problem, preventing scalable synthesis with satisfaction guarantees. To address this, we formulate STL planning as an optimization program under arbitrary multi-agent constraints and introduce a penalty-based unconstrained relaxation that can be efficiently solved via a Block-Coordinate Gradient Descent (BCGD) method, where each block corresponds to a single agent's decision variables, thereby mitigating complexity. By utilizing a quadratic penalty function defined via smooth STL semantics, we show that BCGD iterations converge to a stationary point of the penalized problem under standard regularity assumptions. To enforce feasibility, the BCGD solver is embedded within a two-layer optimization scheme: inner BCGD updates are performed for a fixed penalty parameter, which is then increased in an outer loop to progressively improve multi-agent STL robustness. The proposed framework enables scalable computations and is validated through various complex multi-robot planning scenarios.

Title: Analytical Derivation of Quantization Error in Threshold Level Quantizers Using Bipolar PFM
Authors: Ricardo Carrero, Ruben Garvi, Luis Hernandez
Abstract: Uniform quantization is a topic that has been extensively studied. However and although an analytical description of quantization noise has been proposed, most descriptions of the spectral properties of quantization error resort to statistical descriptions. In this paper, we show how the spectrum of a quantized signal can be expressed using pulse frequency modulation. We first establish the equivalence of a uniform quantizer with a system based on the bipolar pulse frequency modulation and we define afterwards the Fourier transform of the quantized signal using pulse frequency modulation properties. This model brings a more intuitive understanding of the spectral structure of quantization noise and complements prior research in the topic. The results of the paper can be directly applied to level crossing ADCs with zero-order-hold interpolators, giving an accurate estimation of their performance.

Title: Robust Adaptive Sliding-Mode Control for Damaged Fixed-Wing UAVs
Authors: Mark Spiller, Lennart Kracke, Johannes Autenrieb
Abstract: Many unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can remain aerodynamically flyable after sustaining structural or control surface damage, yet insufficient robustness in conventional autopilots often leads to mission failure. This paper proposes a robust adaptive sliding mode controller (RASMC) for fixed-wing UAVs subject to aerodynamic coefficient perturbations and partial loss of control surface effectiveness. A damage-aware flight dynamics model is developed to systematically analyze the impact of such impairments on the closed-loop behavior. The RASMC is designed to ensure reliable tracking and stabilization, while a gain adaptation law maintains low control effort under nominal conditions and increases the gains as needed in the presence of aerodynamic damage. Lyapunov-based stability guarantees are derived, and assumptions on admissible uncertainty bounds are formulated to characterize the limits within which closed-loop stability and performance can be ensured. The proposed controller is implemented within an existing UAV autopilot framework, where outer-loop guidance and speed control modules provide reference commands to the RASMC for attitude stabilization. Simulations demonstrate that, despite significant aerodynamic damage and control surface degradation, all closed-loop states remain stable with bounded tracking errors.

Title: Dodging the Moose: Experimental Insights in Real-Life Automated Collision Avoidance
Authors: Leila Gharavi, Simone Baldi, Yuki Hosomi, Tona Sato, Bart De Schutter, Binh-Minh Nguyen, Hiroshi Fujimoto
Abstract: The sudden appearance of a static obstacle on the road, i.e. the moose test, is a well-known emergency scenario in collision avoidance for automated driving. Model Predictive Control (MPC) has long been employed for planning and control of automated vehicles in the state of the art. However, real-time implementation of automated collision avoidance in emergency scenarios such as the moose test remains unaddressed due to the high computational demand of MPC for evasive action in such hazardous scenarios. This paper offers new insights into real-time collision avoidance via the experimental imple- mentation of MPC for motion planning after a sudden and unexpected appearance of a static obstacle. As the state-of-the-art nonlinear MPC shows limited capability to provide an acceptable solution in real-time, we propose a human-like feed-forward planner to assist when the MPC optimization problem is either infeasible or unable to find a suitable solution due to the poor quality of its initial guess. We introduce the concept of maximum steering maneuver to design the feed-forward planner and mimic a human-like reaction after detecting the static obstacle on the road. Real-life experiments are conducted across various speeds and level of emergency using FPEV2-Kanon electric vehicle. Moreover, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our planning strategy via comparison with the state-of- the-art MPC motion planner.

Title: Neural Implicit Representations for 3D Synthetic Aperture Radar Imaging
Authors: Nithin Sugavanam, Emre Ertin
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) is a tomographic sensor that measures 2D slices of the 3D spatial Fourier transform of the scene. In many operational scenarios, the measured set of 2D slices does not fill the 3D space in the Fourier domain, resulting in significant artifacts in the reconstructed imagery. Traditionally, simple priors, such as sparsity in the image domain, are used to regularize the inverse problem. In this paper, we review our recent work that achieves state-of-the-art results in 3D SAR imaging employing neural structures to model the surface scattering that dominates SAR returns. These neural structures encode the surface of the objects in the form of a signed distance function learned from the sparse scattering data. Since estimating a smooth surface from a sparse and noisy point cloud is an ill-posed problem, we regularize the surface estimation by sampling points from the implicit surface representation during the training step. We demonstrate the model's ability to represent target scattering using measured and simulated data from single vehicles and a larger scene with a large number of vehicles. We conclude with future research directions calling for methods to learn complex-valued neural representations to enable synthesizing new collections from the volumetric neural implicit representation.

Title: Device-Centric ISAC for Exposure Control via Opportunistic Virtual Aperture Sensing
Authors: Marouan Mizmizi, Zhibin Yu, Guanglong Du, Umberto Spagnolini
Abstract: Regulatory limits on Maximum Permissible Exposure (MPE) require handheld devices to reduce transmit power when operated near the user's body. Current proximity sensors provide only binary detection, triggering conservative power back-off that degrades link quality. If the device could measure its distance from the body, transmit power could be adjusted proportionally, improving throughput while maintaining compliance. This paper develops a device-centric integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) method for the device to measure this distance. The uplink communication waveform is exploited for sensing, and the natural motion of the user's hand creates a virtual aperture that provides the angular resolution necessary for localization. Virtual aperture processing requires precise knowledge of the device trajectory, which in this scenario is opportunistic and unknown. One can exploit onboard inertial sensors to estimate the device trajectory; however, the inertial sensors accuracy is not sufficient. To address this, we develop an autofocus algorithm based on extended Kalman filtering that jointly tracks the trajectory and compensates residual errors using phase observations from strong scatterers. The Bayesian Cramér-Rao bound for localization is derived under correlated inertial errors. Numerical results at 28GHz demonstrate centimeter-level accuracy with realistic sensor parameters.

Title: Method to Compute Pointing Displacement, Smear, and Jitter Covariances for Optical Payloads
Authors: Peter Seiler, Mark E. Pittelkau, Felix Biertümpfel
Abstract: This paper presents a method to assess the pointing and image motion performance of optical payloads in the presence of image displacement (shift), smear, and jitter. The method assumes the motion is a stationary random process over an image exposure interval. Displacement, smear, and jitter covariances are computed from the solution to a Lyapunov differential equation. These covariances parameterize statistical image motion modulation transfer functions (MTFs), and they can be used to verify pointing and image motion MTF requirements. The method in the present paper extends a previous method to include smear, as well as displacement, and hence jitter. The approach in the present paper also leads, as a special case, to a more efficient method to compute the displacement covariance than the previous method. Numerical examples illustrate the proposed method.

Authors: Blaž Bertalanič, Matej Vnučec, Carolina Fortuna
Abstract: In today's world, modern infrastructures are being equipped with information and communication technologies to create large IoT networks. It is essential to monitor these networks to ensure smooth operations by detecting and correcting link failures or abnormal network behaviour proactively, which can otherwise cause interruptions in business operations. This paper presents a novel method for detecting anomalies in wireless links using graph neural networks. The proposed approach involves converting time series data into graphs and training a new graph neural network architecture based on graph attention networks that successfully detects anomalies at the level of individual measurements of the time series data. The model provides competitive results compared to the state of the art while being computationally more efficient with ~171 times fewer trainable parameters.

Title: A Network Science Approach to Granular Time Series Segmentation
Authors: Ivana Kesić, Carolina Fortuna, Mihael Mohorčič, Blaž Bertalanič
Abstract: Time series segmentation (TSS) is one of the time series (TS) analysis techniques, that has received considerably less attention compared to other TS related tasks. In recent years, deep learning architectures have been introduced for TSS, however their reliance on sliding windows limits segmentation granularity due to fixed window sizes and strides. To overcome these challenges, we propose a new more granular TSS approach that utilizes the Weighted Dual Perspective Visbility Graph (WDPVG) TS into a graph and combines it with a Graph Attention Network (GAT). By transforming TS into graphs, we are able to capture different structural aspects of the data that would otherwise remain hidden. By utilizing the representation learning capabilities of Graph Neural Networks, our method is able to effectively identify meaningful segments within the TS. To better understand the potential of our approach, we also experimented with different TS-to-graph transformations and compared their performance. Our contributions include: a) formulating the TSS as a node classification problem on graphs; b) conducting an extensive analysis of various TS-to-graph transformations applied to TSS using benchmark datasets from the TSSB repository; c) providing the first detailed study on utilizing GNNs for analyzing graph representations of TS in the context of TSS; d) demonstrating the effectiveness of our method, which achieves an average F1 score of 0.97 across 59 diverse TSS benchmark datasets; e) outperforming the seq2point baseline method by 0.05 in terms of F1 score; and f) reducing the required training data compared to the baseline methods.

Title: Retrieval Augmented (Knowledge Graph), and Large Language Model-Driven Design Structure Matrix (DSM) Generation of Cyber-Physical Systems
Authors: H. Sinan Bank, Daniel R. Herber
Abstract: We explore the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), and Graph-based RAG (GraphRAG) for generating Design Structure Matrices (DSMs). We test these methods on two distinct use cases -- a power screwdriver and a CubeSat with known architectural references -- evaluating their performance on two key tasks: determining relationships between predefined components, and the more complex challenge of identifying components and their subsequent relationships. We measure the performance by assessing each element of the DSM and overall architecture. Despite design and computational challenges, we identify opportunities for automated DSM generation, with all code publicly available for reproducibility and further feedback from the domain experts.

Title: Speech to Speech Synthesis for Voice Impersonation
Authors: Bjorn Johnson, Jared Levy
Abstract: Numerous models have shown great success in the fields of speech recognition as well as speech synthesis, but models for speech to speech processing have not been heavily explored. We propose Speech to Speech Synthesis Network (STSSN), a model based on current state of the art systems that fuses the two disciplines in order to perform effective speech to speech style transfer for the purpose of voice impersonation. We show that our proposed model is quite powerful, and succeeds in generating realistic audio samples despite a number of drawbacks in its capacity. We benchmark our proposed model by comparing it with a generative adversarial model which accomplishes a similar task, and show that ours produces more convincing results.

Title: A Few-Shot LLM Framework for Extreme Day Classification in Electricity Markets
Authors: Saud Alghumayjan, Ming Yi, Bolun Xu
Abstract: This paper proposes a few-shot classification framework based on Large Language Models (LLMs) to predict whether the next day will have spikes in real-time electricity prices. The approach aggregates system state information, including electricity demand, renewable generation, weather forecasts, and recent electricity prices, into a set of statistical features that are formatted as natural-language prompts and fed to an LLM along with general instructions. The model then determines the likelihood that the next day would be a spike day and reports a confidence score. Using historical data from the Texas electricity market, we demonstrate that this few-shot approach achieves performance comparable to supervised machine learning models, such as Support Vector Machines and XGBoost, and outperforms the latter two when limited historical data are available. These findings highlight the potential of LLMs as a data-efficient tool for classifying electricity price spikes in settings with scarce data.

Title: Smooth trajectory generation and hybrid B-splines-Quaternions based tool path interpolation for a 3T1R parallel kinematic milling robot
Authors: Sina Akhbari, Mehran Mahboubkhah
Abstract: This paper presents a smooth trajectory generation method for a four-degree-of-freedom parallel kinematic milling robot. The proposed approach integrates B-spline and Quaternion interpolation techniques to manage decoupled position and orientation data points. The synchronization of orientation and arc-length-parameterized position data is achieved through the fitting of smooth piece-wise Bezier curves, which describe the non-linear relationship between path length and tool orientation, solved via sequential quadratic programming. By leveraging the convex hull properties of Bezier curves, the method ensures spatial and temporal separation constraints for multi-agent trajectory generation. Unit quaternions are employed for orientation interpolation, providing a robust and efficient representation that avoids gimbal lock and facilitates smooth, continuous rotation. Modifier polynomials are used for position interpolation. Temporal trajectories are optimized using minimum jerk, time-optimal piece-wise Bezier curves in two stages: task space followed by joint space, implemented on a low-cost microcontroller. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method offers enhanced accuracy, reduced velocity fluctuations, and computational efficiency compared to conventional interpolation methods.

Title: Machine Learning Argument of Latitude Error Model for LEO Satellite Orbit and Covariance Correction
Authors: Alex Moody, Penina Axelrad, Rebecca Russell
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites are leveraged to support new position, navigation, and timing (PNT) service alternatives to GNSS. These alternatives require accurate propagation of satellite position and velocity with a realistic quantification of uncertainty. It is commonly assumed that the propagated uncertainty distribution is Gaussian; however, the validity of this assumption can be quickly compromised by the mismodeling of atmospheric drag. We develop a machine learning approach that corrects error growth in the argument of latitude for a diverse set of LEO satellites. The improved orbit propagation accuracy extends the applicability of the Gaussian assumption and modeling of the errors with a corrected mean and covariance. We compare the performance of a time-conditioned neural network and a Gaussian Process on datasets computed with an open source orbit propagator and publicly available Vector Covariance Message (VCM) ephemerides. The learned models predict the argument of latitude error as a Gaussian distribution given parameters from a single VCM epoch and reverse propagation errors. We show that this one-dimensional model captures the effect of mismodeled drag, which can be mapped to the Cartesian state space. The correction method only updates information along the dimensions of dominant error growth, while maintaining the physics-based propagation of VCM covariance in the remaining dimensions. We therefore extend the utility of VCM ephemerides to longer time horizons without modifying the functionality of the existing propagator.

Title: Spatio-temporal dual-stage hypergraph MARL for human-centric multimodal corridor traffic signal control
Authors: Xiaocai Zhang, Neema Nassir, Milad Haghani
Abstract: Human-centric traffic signal control in corridor networks must increasingly account for multimodal travelers, particularly high-occupancy public transportation, rather than focusing solely on vehicle-centric performance. This paper proposes STDSH-MARL (Spatio-Temporal Dual-Stage Hypergraph based Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning), a scalable multi-agent deep reinforcement learning framework that follows a centralized training and decentralized execution paradigm. The proposed method captures spatio-temporal dependencies through a novel dual-stage hypergraph attention mechanism that models interactions across both spatial and temporal hyperedges. In addition, a hybrid discrete action space is introduced to jointly determine the next signal phase configuration and its corresponding green duration, enabling more adaptive signal timing decisions. Experiments conducted on a corridor network under five traffic scenarios demonstrate that STDSH-MARL consistently improves multimodal performance and provides clear benefits for public transportation priority. Compared with state-of-the-art baseline methods, the proposed approach achieves superior overall performance. Further ablation studies confirm the contribution of each component of STDSH-MARL, with temporal hyperedges identified as the most influential factor driving the observed performance gains.

Title: Geometric Inverse Flight Dynamics on SO(3) and Application to Tethered Fixed-Wing Aircraft
Authors: Antonio Franchi, Chiara Gabellieri
Abstract: We present a robotics-oriented, coordinate-free formulation of inverse flight dynamics for fixed-wing aircraft on SO(3). Translational force balance is written in the world frame and rotational dynamics in the body frame; aerodynamic directions (drag, lift, side) are defined geometrically, avoiding local attitude coordinates. Enforcing coordinated flight (no sideslip), we derive a closed-form trajectory-to-input map yielding the attitude, angular velocity, and thrust-angle-of-attack pair, and we recover the aerodynamic moment coefficients component-wise. Applying such a map to tethered flight on spherical parallels, we obtain analytic expressions for the required bank angle and identify a specific zero-bank locus where the tether tension exactly balances centrifugal effects, highlighting the decoupling between aerodynamic coordination and the apparent gravity vector. Under a simple lift/drag law, the minimal-thrust angle of attack admits a closed form. These pointwise quasi-steady inversion solutions become steady-flight trim when the trajectory and rotational dynamics are time-invariant. The framework bridges inverse simulation in aeronautics with geometric modeling in robotics, providing a rigorous building block for trajectory design and feasibility checks.

Title: Continual uncertainty learning
Authors: Heisei Yonezawa, Ansei Yonezawa, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: Robust control of mechanical systems with multiple uncertainties remains a fundamental challenge, particularly when nonlinear dynamics and operating-condition variations are intricately intertwined. While deep reinforcement learning (DRL) combined with domain randomization has shown promise in mitigating the sim-to-real gap, simultaneously handling all sources of uncertainty often leads to sub-optimal policies and poor learning efficiency. This study formulates a new curriculum-based continual learning framework for robust control problems involving nonlinear dynamical systems in which multiple sources of uncertainty are simultaneously superimposed. The key idea is to decompose a complex control problem with multiple uncertainties into a sequence of continual learning tasks, in which strategies for handling each uncertainty are acquired sequentially. The original system is extended into a finite set of plants whose dynamic uncertainties are gradually expanded and diversified as learning progresses. The policy is stably updated across the entire plant sets associated with tasks defined by different uncertainty configurations without catastrophic forgetting. To ensure learning efficiency, we jointly incorporate a model-based controller (MBC), which guarantees a shared baseline performance across the plant sets, into the learning process to accelerate the convergence. This residual learning scheme facilitates task-specific optimization of the DRL agent for each uncertainty, thereby enhancing sample efficiency. As a practical industrial application, this study applies the proposed method to designing an active vibration controller for automotive powertrains. We verified that the resulting controller is robust against structural nonlinearities and dynamic variations, realizing successful sim-to-real transfer.

Title: Nonlinear Predictive Control of the Continuum and Hybrid Dynamics of a Suspended Deformable Cable for Aerial Pick and Place
Authors: Antonio Rapuano, Yaolei Shen, Federico Califano, Chiara Gabellieri, Antonio Franchi
Abstract: This paper presents a framework for aerial manipulation of an extensible cable that combines a high-fidelity model based on partial differential equations (PDEs) with a reduced-order representation suitable for real-time control. The PDEs are discretised using a finite-difference method, and proper orthogonal decomposition is employed to extract a reduced-order model (ROM) that retains the dominant deformation modes while significantly reducing computational complexity. Based on this ROM, a nonlinear model predictive control scheme is formulated, capable of stabilizing cable oscillations and handling hybrid transitions such as payload attachment and detachment. Simulation results confirm the stability, efficiency, and robustness of the ROM, as well as the effectiveness of the controller in regulating cable dynamics under a range of operating conditions. Additional simulations illustrate the application of the ROM for trajectory planning in constrained environments, demonstrating the versatility of the proposed approach. Overall, the framework enables real-time, dynamics-aware control of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) carrying suspended flexible cables.

Title: A Multi-modal Detection System for Infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority
Authors: Ziyan Zhang, Chuheng Wei, Xuanpeng Zhao, Siyan Li, Will Snyder, Mike Stas, Peng Hao, Kanok Boriboonsomsin, Guoyuan Wu
Abstract: Freight vehicles approaching signalized intersections require reliable detection and motion estimation to support infrastructure-based Freight Signal Priority (FSP). Accurate and timely perception of vehicle type, position, and speed is essential for enabling effective priority control strategies. This paper presents the design, deployment, and evaluation of an infrastructure-based multi-modal freight vehicle detection system integrating LiDAR and camera sensors. A hybrid sensing architecture is adopted, consisting of an intersection-mounted subsystem and a midblock subsystem, connected via wireless communication for synchronized data transmission. The perception pipeline incorporates both clustering-based and deep learning-based detection methods with Kalman filter tracking to achieve stable real-time performance. LiDAR measurements are registered into geodetic reference frames to support lane-level localization and consistent vehicle tracking. Field evaluations demonstrate that the system can reliably monitor freight vehicle movements at high spatio-temporal resolution. The design and deployment provide practical insights for developing infrastructure-based sensing systems to support FSP applications.

Title: Visual Insights into Agentic Optimization of Pervasive Stream Processing Services
Authors: Boris Sedlak, Víctor Casamayor Pujol, Schahram Dustdar
Abstract: Processing sensory data close to the data source, often involving Edge devices, promises low latency for pervasive applications, like smart cities. This commonly involves a multitude of processing services, executed with limited resources; this setup faces three problems: first, the application demand and the resource availability fluctuate, so the service execution must scale dynamically to sustain processing requirements (e.g., latency); second, each service permits different actions to adjust its operation, so they require individual scaling policies; third, without a higher-level mediator, services would cannibalize any resources of services co-located on the same device. This demo first presents a platform for context-aware autoscaling of stream processing services that allows developers to monitor and adjust the service execution across multiple service-specific parameters. We then connect a scaling agent to these interfaces that gradually builds an understanding of the processing environment by exploring each service's action space; the agent then optimizes the service execution according to this knowledge. Participants can revisit the demo contents as video summary and introductory poster, or build a custom agent by extending the artifact repository.

Title: LexiSafe: Offline Safe Reinforcement Learning with Lexicographic Safety-Reward Hierarchy
Authors: Hsin-Jung Yang, Zhanhong Jiang, Prajwal Koirala, Qisai Liu, Cody Fleming, Soumik Sarkar
Abstract: Offline safe reinforcement learning (RL) is increasingly important for cyber-physical systems (CPS), where safety violations during training are unacceptable and only pre-collected data are available. Existing offline safe RL methods typically balance reward-safety tradeoffs through constraint relaxation or joint optimization, but they often lack structural mechanisms to prevent safety drift. We propose LexiSafe, a lexicographic offline RL framework designed to preserve safety-aligned behavior. We first develop LexiSafe-SC, a single-cost formulation for standard offline safe RL, and derive safety-violation and performance-suboptimality bounds that together yield sample-complexity guarantees. We then extend the framework to hierarchical safety requirements with LexiSafe-MC, which supports multiple safety costs and admits its own sample-complexity analysis. Empirically, LexiSafe demonstrates reduced safety violations and improved task performance compared to constrained offline baselines. By unifying lexicographic prioritization with structural bias, LexiSafe offers a practical and theoretically grounded approach for safety-critical CPS decision-making.

Title: Contact-Anchored Proprioceptive Odometry for Quadruped Robots
Authors: Minxing Sun, Yao Mao
Abstract: Reliable odometry for legged robots without cameras or LiDAR remains challenging due to IMU drift and noisy joint velocity sensing. This paper presents a purely proprioceptive state estimator that uses only IMU and motor measurements to jointly estimate body pose and velocity, with a unified formulation applicable to biped, quadruped, and wheel-legged robots. The key idea is to treat each contacting leg as a kinematic anchor: joint-torque--based foot wrench estimation selects reliable contacts, and the corresponding footfall positions provide intermittent world-frame constraints that suppress long-term drift. To prevent elevation drift during extended traversal, we introduce a lightweight height clustering and time-decay correction that snaps newly recorded footfall heights to previously observed support planes. To improve foot velocity observations under encoder quantization, we apply an inverse-kinematics cubature Kalman filter that directly filters foot-end velocities from joint angles and velocities. The implementation further mitigates yaw drift through multi-contact geometric consistency and degrades gracefully to a kinematics-derived heading reference when IMU yaw constraints are unavailable or unreliable. We evaluate the method on four quadruped platforms (three Astrall robots and a Unitree Go2 EDU) using closed-loop trajectories. On Astrall point-foot robot~A, a $\sim$200\,m horizontal loop and a $\sim$15\,m vertical loop return with 0.1638\,m and 0.219\,m error, respectively; on wheel-legged robot~B, the corresponding errors are 0.2264\,m and 0.199\,m. On wheel-legged robot~C, a $\sim$700\,m horizontal loop yields 7.68\,m error and a $\sim$20\,m vertical loop yields 0.540\,m error. Unitree Go2 EDU closes a $\sim$120\,m horizontal loop with 2.2138\,m error and a $\sim$8\,m vertical loop with less than 0.1\,m vertical error. this http URL

Title: Distributed Virtual Model Control for Scalable Human-Robot Collaboration in Shared Workspace
Authors: Yi Zhang, Omar Faris, Chapa Sirithunge, Kai-Fung Chu, Fumiya Iida, Fulvio Forni
Abstract: We present a decentralized, agent agnostic, and safety-aware control framework for human-robot collaboration based on Virtual Model Control (VMC). In our approach, both humans and robots are embedded in the same virtual-component-shaped workspace, where motion is the result of the interaction with virtual springs and dampers rather than explicit trajectory planning. A decentralized, force-based stall detector identifies deadlocks, which are resolved through negotiation. This reduces the probability of robots getting stuck in the block placement task from up to 61.2% to zero in our experiments. The framework scales without structural changes thanks to the distributed implementation: in experiments we demonstrate safe collaboration with up to two robots and two humans, and in simulation up to four robots, maintaining inter-agent separation at around 20 cm. Results show that the method shapes robot behavior intuitively by adjusting control parameters and achieves deadlock-free operation across team sizes in all tested scenarios.

Title: Hybrid System Planning using a Mixed-Integer ADMM Heuristic and Hybrid Zonotopes
Authors: Joshua A. Robbins, Andrew F. Thompson, Jonah J. Glunt, Herschel C. Pangborn
Abstract: Embedded optimization-based planning for hybrid systems is challenging due to the use of mixed-integer programming, which is computationally intensive and often sensitive to the specific numerical formulation. To address that challenge, this article proposes a framework for motion planning of hybrid systems that pairs hybrid zonotopes - an advanced set representation - with a new alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) mixed-integer programming heuristic. A general treatment of piecewise affine (PWA) system reachability analysis using hybrid zonotopes is presented and extended to formulate optimal planning problems. Sets produced using the proposed identities have lower memory complexity and tighter convex relaxations than equivalent sets produced from preexisting techniques. The proposed ADMM heuristic makes efficient use of the hybrid zonotope structure. For planning problems formulated as hybrid zonotopes, the proposed heuristic achieves improved convergence rates as compared to state-of-the-art mixed-integer programming heuristics. The proposed methods for hybrid system planning on embedded hardware are experimentally applied in a combined behavior and motion planning scenario for autonomous driving.

Title: The Cascade Equivalence Hypothesis: When Do Speech LLMs Behave Like ASR$\rightarrow$LLM Pipelines?
Authors: Jayadev Billa
Abstract: Current speech LLMs largely perform implicit ASR: on tasks solvable from a transcript, they are behaviorally and mechanistically equivalent to simple Whisper$\to$LLM cascades. We show this through matched-backbone testing across four speech LLMs and six tasks, controlling for the LLM backbone for the first time. Ultravox is statistically indistinguishable from its matched cascade ($\kappa{=}0.93$); logit lens reveals literal text emerging in hidden states; LEACE concept erasure confirms text representations are causally necessary in both architectures tested, collapsing accuracy to near-zero. Qwen2-Audio genuinely diverges, revealing cascade equivalence is architecture-dependent, not universal. For most deployed use cases, current speech LLMs are expensive cascades, and under noise, they are worse ones, with clean-condition advantages reversing by up to 7.6% at 0 dB.

Title: Graph Neural Network-based End-to-End Learning for Multi-User MIMO Systems
Authors: Hao Chang, Hoang Triet Vo, Alva Kosasih, Branka Vucetic, Wibowo Hardjawana
Abstract: End-to-end (E2E) learning has recently been proposed to jointly design the modulator and symbol detector by using deep neural networks (DNNs). However, existing schemes lack sufficient capability to cancel multi-user interference (MUI) in uplink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. In this paper, we propose a graph neural network (GNN)-based E2E learning scheme that employs a GNN-based modulator to generate learned constellation points, and a GNN-based detector to cancel MUI. They are jointly optimized to minimize the symbol error rate (SER) performance loss. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed E2E outperforms existing schemes with a predefined modulator. Specifically, it achieves an approximate 2 dB gain in a high MUI environment and surpasses even the maximum-likelihood (ML) detector in a low MUI condition.

Title: Compression and Distillation of Data Quadruplets in Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar
Abstract: This paper introduces a quadrature-free, non-intrusive approach to balanced truncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method non-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer function samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that the proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based balanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their respective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets can be utilized to develop three non-intrusive formulations of the IRKA for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. These formulations non-intrusively generate reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\omega$-axis or the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these IRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function samples as IRKA iteratively updates the interpolation points. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show that the proposed non-intrusive approaches perform comparably to their intrusive counterparts.

Title: Reach-avoid games for players with damped double integrator dynamics
Authors: Mengxin Lyu, Ruiliang Deng, Zongying Shi, Yisheng Zhong
Abstract: This paper investigates a reach-avoid game between two players with damped double integrator dynamics. An optimal state-feedback strategy is derived using a differential game framework combined with geometric analysis. To facilitate the analysis, we introduce the concept of multiple reachable region by characterizing the motion of players with damped double integrator dynamics. Based on this, a new type of the attackers dominance region is introduced. We show that distinct strategies are required depending on the location of the terminal position within different areas of the attacker's dominance region. Furthermore, we prove that the proposed strategies satisfy the necessary condition for optimality. Numerical simulations are provided to illustrate the conclusions.

Title: Nonlinear Sparse Bayesian Learning Methods with Application to Massive MIMO Channel Estimation with Hardware Impairments
Authors: Arttu Arjas, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Accurate channel estimation is critical for realizing the performance gains of massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Traditional approaches to channel estimation typically assume ideal receiver hardware and linear signal models. However, practical receivers suffer from impairments such as nonlinearities in the low-noise amplifiers and quantization errors, which invalidate standard model assumptions and degrade the estimation accuracy. In this work, we propose a nonlinear channel estimation framework that models the distortion function arising from hardware impairments using Gaussian process (GP) regression while leveraging the inherent sparsity of massive MIMO channels. First, we form a GP-based surrogate of the distortion function, employing pseudo-inputs to reduce the computational complexity. Then, we integrate the GP-based surrogate of the distortion function into newly developed enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL) methods, enabling distortion-aware sparse channel estimation. Specifically, we propose two nonlinear SBL methods based on distinct optimization objectives, each offering a different trade-off between estimation accuracy and computational complexity. Numerical results demonstrate significant gains over the Bussgang linear minimum mean squared error estimator and linear SBL, particularly under strong distortion and at high signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: Adversarial Deep Learning for Simultaneous Segmentation of Ventricular and White Matter Hyperintensities in Clinical MRI
Authors: Mahdi Bashiri Bawil, Mousa Shamsi, Abolhassan Shakeri Bavil
Abstract: Purpose: Multiple sclerosis (MS) diagnosis requires accurate assessment of white matter hyperintensities (WMH) and ventricular changes on brain MRI. Current methods treat these structures independently, struggle to differentiate normal from pathological hyperintensities, and perform poorly on anisotropic clinical data. We present a deep learning framework that simultaneously segments ventricles and WMH while distinguishing normal periventricular hyperintensities from pathological MS lesions. Methods: We developed a 2D pix2pix architecture trained on FLAIR scans from 300 MS patients combined with the MSSEG2016 benchmark (15 patients). Five architectural variants were compared through systematic ablation using 5-fold cross-validation with patient-level stratification, progressively integrating adversarial training, attention-weighted discrimination, and adaptive hybrid loss. Performance was assessed against six established methods using Dice coefficient, Hausdorff distance, precision, and recall. Results: The final architecture (V5) achieved mean Dice 0.852+/-0.004 and HD95 4.87+/-0.13mm across all classes. Per-class performance: ventricles (Dice 0.907+/-0.002, HD95 3.00+/-0.51mm), abnormal WMH (Dice 0.825+/-0.009, HD95 4.51+/-0.32mm), normal WMH (Dice 0.677+/-0.007). V5 outperformed all baselines on local data for both ventricle and WMH segmentation. Ablation analysis confirmed adversarial training provided the largest single gain (+0.109 Dice). End-to-end processing required ~4 seconds per case-up to 36x faster than baseline methods. Conclusions: This systematically validated framework combines adversarial training, attention-weighted discrimination, and adaptive loss scheduling to achieve improved accuracy, clinically relevant lesion differentiation, and computational efficiency suitable for routine clinical workflows.

Title: Deception Against Data-Driven Linear-Quadratic Control
Authors: Filippos Fotiadis, Aris Kanellopoulos, Kyriakos G. Vamvoudakis, Ufuk Topcu
Abstract: Deception is a common defense mechanism against adversaries with an information disadvantage. It can force such adversaries to select suboptimal policies for a defender's benefit. We consider a setting where an adversary tries to learn the optimal linear-quadratic attack against a system, the dynamics of which it does not know. On the other end, a defender who knows its dynamics exploits its information advantage and injects a deceptive input into the system to mislead the adversary. The defender's aim is to then strategically design this deceptive input: it should force the adversary to learn, as closely as possible, a pre-selected attack that is different from the optimal one. We show that this deception design problem boils down to the solution of a coupled algebraic Riccati and a Lyapunov equation which, however, are challenging to tackle analytically. Nevertheless, we use a block successive over-relaxation algorithm to extract their solution numerically and prove the algorithm's convergence under certain conditions. We perform simulations on a benchmark aircraft, where we showcase how the proposed algorithm can mislead adversaries into learning attacks that are less performance-degrading.

Title: Nonlinear Model Order Reduction of Dynamical Systems in Process Engineering: Review and Comparison
Authors: Jan C. Schulze, Alexander Mitsos
Abstract: Computationally cheap yet accurate dynamical models are a key requirement for real-time capable nonlinear optimization and model-based control. When given a computationally expensive high-order prediction model, a reduction to a lower-order simplified model can enable such real-time applications. Herein, we review nonlinear model order reduction methods and provide a comparison of method characteristics. Additionally, we discuss both general-purpose methods and tailored approaches for chemical process systems and we identify similarities and differences between these methods. As machine learning manifold-Galerkin approaches currently do not account for inputs in the construction of the reduced state subspace, we extend these methods to dynamical systems with inputs. In a comparative case study, we apply eight established model order reduction methods to an air separation process model: POD-Galerkin, nonlinear-POD-Galerkin, manifold-Galerkin, dynamic mode decomposition, Koopman theory, manifold learning with latent predictor, compartment modeling, and model aggregation. Herein, we do not investigate hyperreduction, i.e., reduction of floating point operations. Based on our findings, we discuss strengths and weaknesses of the model order reduction methods.

Title: Array-Aware Ambisonics and HRTF Encoding for Binaural Reproduction With Wearable Arrays
Authors: Yhonatan Gayer, Vladimir Tourbabin, Zamir Ben Hur, David Lou Alon, Boaz Rafaely
Abstract: This work introduces a novel method for binaural reproduction from arbitrary microphone arrays, based on array-aware optimization of Ambisonics encoding through Head-Related Transfer Function (HRTF) pre-processing. The proposed approach integrates array-specific information into the HRTF processing pipeline, leading to improved spatial accuracy in binaural rendering. Objective evaluations demonstrate superior performance under simulated wearable-array and head rotations compared to conventional Ambisonics encoding method. A listening experiment further confirms that the method achieves significantly higher perceptual ratings in both timbre and spatial quality. Fully compatible with standard Ambisonics, the proposed method offers a practical solution for spatial audio rendering in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, and wearable audio capture.

Title: Federated Learning Enhanced by Feature Reconstruction for Semantic Communication Module Updates of Agents
Authors: Yoon Huh, Bumjun Kim, Wan Choi
Abstract: Recent advancements in semantic communication have primarily focused on image transmission, where neural network-based joint source-channel coding modules play a central role. However, such systems often experience semantic communication errors due to mismatched knowledge bases between agents and performance degradation from outdated models, necessitating regular model updates. To address these challenges in vector quantization (VQ)-based image semantic communication systems, we propose FedSFR, a novel federated learning framework that incorporates semantic feature reconstruction (FR). FedSFR introduces an FR step at the parameter server and allows a subset of clients to transmit compact feature vectors in lieu of sending full local model updates, thereby improving training stability and communication efficiency. To enable effective FR learning, we design a loss function tailored for VQ-based image semantic communication and demonstrate its validity as a surrogate for image reconstruction error. We further establish a rigorous convergence analysis of FedSFR. Experimental results on two benchmark datasets validate the superiority of FedSFR over existing baselines, especially in capacity-constrained settings, confirming both its effectiveness and robustness.

Title: Exploiting Convexity of Neural Networks in Dynamic Operating Envelope Optimization for Distributed Energy Resources
Authors: Hongyi Li, Liming Liu, Yunyi Li, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: The increasing penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) brings opportunities and challenges to the operation of distribution systems. To ensure network integrity, dynamic operating envelopes (DOEs) are issued by utilities to DERs as their time-varying export/import power limits. Due to the non-convex nature of power flow equations, the optimization of DOEs faces a dilemma of solution accuracy and computation efficiency. To bridge this gap, in this paper, we facilitate DOE optimization by exploiting the convexity of input convex neural networks (ICNNs). A DOE optimization model is first presented, comprehensively considering multiple operational constraints. We propose a constraint embedding method that allows us to replace the non-convex power flow constraints with trained ICNN models and convexify the problem. To further speed up DOE optimization, we propose a linear relaxation of the ICNN-based DOE optimization problem, for which the tightness is theoretically proven. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated with numerical case studies. Results show that the proposed ICNN-based method outperforms other benchmark methods in optimizing DOEs in terms of both solution quality and solution time.

Title: Discrete optimal transport is a strong audio adversarial attack
Authors: Anton Selitskiy, Akib Shahriyar, Jishnuraj Prakasan
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce the discrete optimal transport voice conversion ($k$DOT-VC) method. Comparison with $k$NN-VC, SinkVC, and Gaussian optimal transport (MKL) demonstrates stronger domain adaptation abilities of our method. We use the probabilistic nature of optimal transport (OT) and show that $k$DOT-VC is an effective black-box adversarial attack against modern audio anti-spoofing countermeasures (CMs). Our attack operates as a post-processing, distribution-alignment step: frame-level {WavLM} embeddings of generated speech are aligned to an unpaired bona fide pool via entropic OT and a top-$k$ barycentric projection, then decoded with a neural vocoder. Ablation analysis indicates that distribution-level alignment is a powerful and stable attack for deployed CMs.

Title: Multimodal Wireless Foundation Models
Authors: Ahmed Aboulfotouh, Hatem Abou-Zeid
Abstract: Wireless foundation models (WFMs) have recently demonstrated promising capabilities, jointly performing multiple wireless functions and adapting effectively to new environments. However, while current WFMs process only one modality, depending on the task and operating conditions, the most informative modality changes and no single modality is best for all tasks. WFMs should therefore be designed to accept multiple modalities to enable a broader and more diverse range of tasks and scenarios. In this work, we propose and build the first multimodal wireless foundation model capable of processing both raw IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities (e.g., spectrograms and CSI) and performing multiple tasks across both. We introduce masked wireless modeling for the multimodal setting, a self-supervised objective and pretraining recipe that learns a joint representation from IQ streams and image-like wireless modalities. We evaluate the model on five tasks across both modality families: image-based (human activity sensing, RF signal classification, 5G NR positioning) and IQ-based (RF device fingerprinting, interference detection/classification). The multimodal WFM is competitive with single-modality WFMs, and in several cases surpasses their performance. Our results demonstrates the strong potential of developing multimodal WFMs that support diverse wireless tasks across different modalities. We believe this provides a concrete step toward both AI-native 6G and the vision of joint sensing, communication, and localization.

Title: AI/ML based Joint Source and Channel Coding for HARQ-ACK Payload
Authors: Akash Doshi, Pinar Sen, Kirill Ivanov, Wei Yang, June Namgoong, Runxin Wang, Rachel Wang, Taesang Yoo, Jing Jiang, Tingfang Ji
Abstract: Channel coding from 2G to 5G has assumed the inputs bits at the physical layer to be uniformly distributed. However, hybrid automatic repeat request acknowledgement (HARQ-ACK) bits transmitted in the uplink are inherently non-uniformly distributed. For such sources, significant performance gains could be obtained by employing joint source channel coding, aided by deep learning-based techniques. In this paper, we learn a transformer-based encoder using a novel "free-lunch" training algorithm and propose per-codeword power shaping to exploit the source prior at the encoder whilst being robust to small changes in the HARQ-ACK distribution. Furthermore, any HARQ-ACK decoder has to achieve a low negative acknowledgement (NACK) error rate to avoid radio link failures resulting from multiple NACK errors. We develop an extension of the Neyman-Pearson test to a coded bit system with multiple information bits to achieve Unequal Error Protection of NACK over ACK bits at the decoder. Finally, we apply the proposed encoder and decoder designs to a 5G New Radio (NR) compliant uplink setup under a fading channel, describing the optimal receiver design and a low complexity coherent approximation to it. Our results demonstrate 3-6 dB reduction in the average transmit power required to achieve the target error rates compared to the NR baseline, while also achieving a 2-3 dB reduction in the maximum transmit power, thus providing for significant coverage gains and power savings.

Title: Scalable Physics-Informed Neural Networks for Accelerating Electromagnetic Transient Stability Assessment
Authors: Ignasi Ventura Nadal, Mohammad Kazem Bakhshizadeh, Petros Aristidou, Nicolae Darii, Rahul Nellikkath, Spyros Chatzivasileiadis
Abstract: This paper puts forward a framework to accelerate Electromagnetic Transient (EMT) simulations by replacing individual components with trained Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs). EMT simulations are considered the cornerstone of transient stability assessment of power systems with high shares of Inverter-Based Resources (IBRs), and, although accurate, they are notorious for their slow simulation speed. Taking a deeper dive into the EMT simulation algorithms, this paper identifies the most computationally expensive components of the simulation and replaces them with fast and accurate PINNs. The proposed novel PINN formulation enables a modular and scalable integration into the simulation algorithm. Using a type-4 wind turbine EMT model, we demonstrate a 4--6x simulation speedup by capturing the Phase-Locked Loop (PLL) with a PINN. We validate all our results with PSCAD software.

Abstract: Whole-slide image (WSI) preprocessing, comprising tissue detection followed by patch extraction, is foundational to AI-driven computational pathology but remains a major bottleneck for scaling to large and heterogeneous cohorts. We present AtlasPatch, a scalable framework that couples foundation-model tissue detection with high-throughput patch extraction at minimal computational overhead. Our tissue detector achieves high precision (0.986) and remains robust across varying tissue conditions (e.g., brightness, fragmentation, boundary definition, tissue heterogeneity) and common artifacts (e.g., pen/ink markings, scanner streaks). This robustness is enabled by our annotated, heterogeneous multi-cohort training set of ~30,000 WSI thumbnails combined with efficient adaptation of the Segment-Anything (SAM) model. AtlasPatch also reduces end-to-end WSI preprocessing time by up to 16$\times$ versus widely used deep-learning pipelines, without degrading downstream task performance. The AtlasPatch tool is open-source, efficiently parallelized for practical deployment, and supports options to save extracted patches or stream them into common feature-extraction models for on-the-fly embedding, making it adaptable to both pathology departments (tissue detection and quality control) and AI researchers (dataset creation and model training). AtlasPatch software package is available at this https URL.

Title: Learning Perceptual Representations for Gaming NR-VQA with Multi-Task FR Signals
Authors: Yu-Chih Chen, Michael Wang, Chieh-Dun Wen, Kai-Siang Ma, Avinab Saha, Li-Heng Chen, Alan Bovik
Abstract: No-reference video quality assessment (NR-VQA) for gaming videos is challenging due to limited human-rated datasets and unique content characteristics including fast motion, stylized graphics, and compression artifacts. We present MTL-VQA, a multi-task learning framework that uses full-reference metrics as supervisory signals to learn perceptually meaningful features without human labels for pretraining. By jointly optimizing multiple full-reference (FR) objectives with adaptive task weighting, our approach learns shared representations that transfer effectively to NR-VQA. Experiments on gaming video datasets show MTL-VQA achieves performance competitive with state-of-the-art NR-VQA methods across both MOS-supervised and label-efficient/self-supervised settings.

Title: Sub Specie Aeternitatis: Fourier Transforms from the Theory of Heat to Musical Signals
Authors: Victor Lazzarini
Abstract: J. B. Fourier in his \emph{Théorie Analytique de la Chaleur} of 1822 introduced, amongst other things, two ideas that have made a fundamental impact in fields as diverse as Mathematical Physics, Electrical Engineering, Computer Science, and Music. The first one of these, a method to find the coefficients for a trigonometric series describing an arbitrary function, was very early on picked up by G. Ohm and H. Helmholtz as the foundation for a theory of \emph{musical tones}. The second one, which is described by Fourier's double integral, became the basis for treating certain kinds of infinity in discontinuous functions, as shown by A. De Morgan in his 1842 \emph{The Differential and Integral Calculus}. Both make up the fundamental basis for what is now commonly known as the \emph{Fourier theorem}. With the help of P. A. M. Dirac's insights into the nature of these infinities, we can have a compact description of the frequency spectrum of a function of time, or conversely of a waveform corresponding to a given function of frequency. This paper, using solely primary sources, takes us from the physics of heat propagation to the modern theory of musical signals. It concludes with some considerations on the inherent duality of time and frequency emerging from Fourier's theorem.

Title: Resp-Agent: An Agent-Based System for Multimodal Respiratory Sound Generation and Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Pengfei Zhang, Tianxin Xie, Minghao Yang, Li Liu
Abstract: Deep learning-based respiratory auscultation is currently hindered by two fundamental challenges: (i) inherent information loss, as converting signals into spectrograms discards transient acoustic events and clinical context; (ii) limited data availability, exacerbated by severe class imbalance. To bridge these gaps, we present Resp-Agent, an autonomous multimodal system orchestrated by a novel Active Adversarial Curriculum Agent (Thinker-A$^2$CA). Unlike static pipelines, Thinker-A$^2$CA serves as a central controller that actively identifies diagnostic weaknesses and schedules targeted synthesis in a closed loop. To address the representation gap, we introduce a Modality-Weaving Diagnoser that weaves EHR data with audio tokens via Strategic Global Attention and sparse audio anchors, capturing both long-range clinical context and millisecond-level transients. To address the data gap, we design a Flow Matching Generator that adapts a text-only Large Language Model (LLM) via modality injection, decoupling pathological content from acoustic style to synthesize hard-to-diagnose samples. As a foundation for these efforts, we introduce Resp-229k, a benchmark corpus of 229k recordings paired with LLM-distilled clinical narratives. Extensive experiments demonstrate that Resp-Agent consistently outperforms prior approaches across diverse evaluation settings, improving diagnostic robustness under data scarcity and long-tailed class imbalance. Our code and data are available at this https URL.

Title: Adaptive Step Duration for Accurate Foot Placement: Achieving Robust Bipedal Locomotion on Terrains with Restricted Footholds
Authors: Zhaoyang Xiang, Victor Paredes, Guillermo A. Castillo, Ayonga Hereid
Abstract: Traditional one-step preview planning algorithms for bipedal locomotion struggle to generate viable gaits when walking across terrains with restricted footholds, such as stepping stones. To overcome such limitations, this paper introduces a novel multi-step preview foot placement planning algorithm based on the step-to-step discrete evolution of the Divergent Component of Motion (DCM) of walking robots. Our proposed approach adaptively changes the step duration and the swing foot trajectory for optimal foot placement under constraints, thereby enhancing the long-term stability of the robot and significantly improving its ability to navigate environments with tight constraints on viable footholds. We demonstrate its effectiveness through various simulation scenarios with complex stepping-stone configurations and external perturbations. These tests underscore its improved performance for navigating foothold-restricted terrains, even with external disturbances.

Title: Risk-Aware Decision Making in Restless Bandits: Theory and Algorithms for Planning and Learning
Authors: Nima Akbarzadeh, Yossiri Adulyasak, Erick Delage
Abstract: In restless bandits, a central agent is tasked with optimally distributing limited resources across several bandits (arms), with each arm being a Markov decision process. In this work, we generalize the traditional restless bandits problem with a risk-neutral objective by incorporating risk-awareness, which is particularly important in various real-world applications especially when the decision maker seeks to mitigate downside risks. We establish indexability conditions for the case of a risk-aware objective and provide a solution based on Whittle index for the first time for the planning problem with finite-horizon non-stationary and for infinite-horizon stationary Markov decision processes. In addition, we address the learning problem when the true transition probabilities are unknown by proposing a Thompson sampling approach and show that it achieves bounded regret that scales sublinearly with the number of episodes and quadratically with the number of arms. The efficacy of our method in reducing risk exposure in restless bandits is illustrated through a set of numerical experiments in the contexts of machine replacement and patient scheduling applications under both planning and learning setups.

Title: Harpocrates: A Statically Typed Privacy Conscious Programming Framework
Authors: Sinan Pehlivanoglu, Malte Schwarzkopf
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce Harpocrates, a compiler plugin and a framework pair for Scala that binds the privacy policies to the data during data creation in form of oblivious membranes. Harpocrates eliminates raw data for a policy protected type from the application, ensuring it can only exist in protected form and centralizes the policy checking to the policy declaration site, making the privacy logic easy to maintain and verify. Instead of approaching privacy from an information flow verification perspective, Harpocrates allow the data to flow freely throughout the application, inside the policy membranes but enforces the policies when the data is tried to be accessed, mutated, declassified or passed through the application boundary. The centralization of the policies allow the maintainers to change the enforced logic simply by updating a single function while keeping the rest of the application oblivious to the change. Especially in a setting where the data definition is shared by multiple applications, the publisher can update the policies without requiring the dependent applications to make any changes beyond updating the dependency version.

Title: AutoProsody: A Prosodic Feature Extraction Tool for Indian Languages
Authors: Preethi Thinakaran, Malarvizhi Muthuramalingam, Sooriya S, Anushiya Rachel Gladston, P. Vijayalakshmi, Hema A Murthy, T. Nagarajan
Abstract: The availability of prosodic information from speech signals is useful in a wide range of applications. However, deriving this information from speech signals can be a laborious task involving manual intervention. Therefore, the current work focuses on developing a tool that can provide prosodic annotations corresponding to a given speech signal, particularly for Indian languages. The proposed Segmentation with Intensity, Tones and Break Indices (SIToBI) tool provides time-aligned phoneme, syllable, and word transcriptions, syllable-level pitch contour annotations, break indices, and syllable-level relative intensity indices. The tool focuses more on syllable-level annotations since Indian languages are syllable-timed. Indians, regardless of the language they speak, may exhibit influences from other languages. As a result, other languages spoken in India may also exhibit syllable-timed characteristics. The accuracy of the annotations derived from the tool is analyzed by comparing them against manual annotations and the tool is observed to perform well. While the current work focuses on three languages, namely, Tamil, Hindi, and Indian English, the tool can easily be extended to other Indian languages and possibly other syllable-timed languages as well.

Title: Offline changepoint localization using a matrix of conformal p-values
Authors: Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable MCP algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We prove a novel conformal Neyman-Pearson lemma, motivating practical classifier-based choices for our conformal score function. Finally, we exemplify the MCP algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images, text, and accelerometer data.

Title: Robust Reinforcement Learning-Based Locomotion for Resource-Constrained Quadrupeds with Exteroceptive Sensing
Authors: Davide Plozza, Patricia Apostol, Paul Joseph, Simon Schläpfer, Michele Magno
Abstract: Compact quadrupedal robots are proving increasingly suitable for deployment in real-world scenarios. Their smaller size fosters easy integration into human environments. Nevertheless, real-time locomotion on uneven terrains remains challenging, particularly due to the high computational demands of terrain perception. This paper presents a robust reinforcement learning-based exteroceptive locomotion controller for resource-constrained small-scale quadrupeds in challenging terrains, which exploits real-time elevation mapping, supported by a careful depth sensor selection. We concurrently train both a policy and a state estimator, which together provide an odometry source for elevation mapping, optionally fused with visual-inertial odometry (VIO). We demonstrate the importance of positioning an additional time-of-flight sensor for maintaining robustness even without VIO, thus having the potential to free up computational resources. We experimentally demonstrate that the proposed controller can flawlessly traverse steps up to 17.5 cm in height and achieve an 80% success rate on 22.5 cm steps, both with and without VIO. The proposed controller also achieves accurate forward and yaw velocity tracking of up to 1.0 m/s and 1.5 rad/s respectively. We open-source our training code at this http URL.

Title: Human-Like Trajectories Generation via Receding Horizon Tracking Applied to the TickTacking Interface
Authors: Daniele Masti, Stefano Menchetti, Çağrı Erdem, Giorgio Gnecco, Davide Rocchesso
Abstract: TickTacking is a rhythm-based interface that allows users to control a pointer in a two-dimensional space through dual-button tapping. This paper investigates the generation of human-like trajectories using a receding horizon approach applied to the TickTacking interface in a target-tracking task. By analyzing user-generated trajectories, we identify key human behavioral features and incorporate them in a controller that mimics these behaviors. The performance of this human-inspired controller is evaluated against a baseline optimal-control-based agent, demonstrating the importance of specific control features for achieving human-like interaction. These findings contribute to the broader goal of developing rhythm-based human-machine interfaces by offering design insights that enhance user performance, improve intuitiveness, and reduce interaction frustration

Title: SceneVGGT: VGGT-based online 3D semantic SLAM for indoor scene understanding and navigation
Authors: Anna Gelencsér-Horváth, Gergely Dinya, Dorka Boglárka Erős, Péter Halász, Islam Muhammad Muqsit, Kristóf Karacs
Abstract: We present SceneVGGT, a spatio-temporal 3D scene understanding framework that combines SLAM with semantic mapping for autonomous and assistive navigation. Built on VGGT, our method scales to long video streams via a sliding-window pipeline. We align local submaps using camera-pose transformations, enabling memory- and speed-efficient mapping while preserving geometric consistency. Semantics are lifted from 2D instance masks to 3D objects using the VGGT tracking head, maintaining temporally coherent identities for change detection. As a proof of concept, object locations are projected onto an estimated floor plane for assistive navigation. The pipeline's GPU memory usage remains under 17 GB, irrespectively of the length of the input sequence and achieves competitive point-cloud performance on the ScanNet++ benchmark. Overall, SceneVGGT ensures robust semantic identification and is fast enough to support interactive assistive navigation with audio feedback.
