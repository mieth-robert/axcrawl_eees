Title: Systole-Conditioned Generative Cardiac Motion
Authors: Shahar Zuler, Gal Lifshitz, Hadar Averbuch-Elor, Dan Raviv
Abstract: Accurate motion estimation in cardiac computed tomography (CT) imaging is critical for assessing cardiac function and surgical planning. Data-driven methods have become the standard approach for dense motion estimation, but they rely on vast amounts of labeled data with dense ground-truth (GT) motion annotations, which are often unfeasible to obtain. To address this limitation, we present a novel approach that synthesizes realistically looking pairs of cardiac CT frames enriched with dense 3D flow field annotations. Our method leverages a conditional Variational Autoencoder (CVAE), which incorporates a novel multi-scale feature conditioning mechanism and is trained to generate 3D flow fields conditioned on a single CT frame. By applying the generated flow field to warp the given frame, we create pairs of frames that simulate realistic myocardium deformations across the cardiac cycle. These pairs serve as fully annotated data samples, providing optical flow GT annotations. Our data generation pipeline could enable the training and validation of more complex and accurate myocardium motion models, allowing for substantially reducing reliance on manual annotations. Our code, along with animated generated samples and additional material, is available on our project page: this https URL.

Title: MSGM: A Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba for EEG Emotion Recognition
Authors: Hanwen Liu, Yifeng Gong, Zuwei Yan, Zeheng Zhuang, Jiaxuan Lu
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition struggles with capturing multi-scale spatiotemporal dynamics and ensuring computational efficiency for real-time applications. Existing methods often oversimplify temporal granularity and spatial hierarchies, limiting accuracy. To overcome these challenges, we propose the Multi-Scale Spatiotemporal Graph Mamba (MSGM), a novel framework integrating multi-window temporal segmentation, bimodal spatial graph modeling, and efficient fusion via the Mamba architecture. By segmenting EEG signals across diverse temporal scales and constructing global-local graphs with neuroanatomical priors, MSGM effectively captures fine-grained emotional fluctuations and hierarchical brain connectivity. A multi-depth Graph Convolutional Network (GCN) and token embedding fusion module, paired with Mamba's state-space modeling, enable dynamic spatiotemporal interaction at linear complexity. Notably, with just one MSST-Mamba layer, MSGM surpasses leading methods in the field on the SEED, THU-EP, and FACED datasets, outperforming baselines in subject-independent emotion classification while achieving robust accuracy and millisecond-level inference on the NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX.

Title: Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Efficient Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices
Authors: Haitian Wang, Xinyu Wang, Yiren Wang, Karen Lee, Zichen Geng, Xian Zhang, Kehkashan Kiran, Yu Zhang, Bo Miao
Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference. Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6\% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4\% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8\% / 81.7\% on the clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5\,ms inference latency and 1.7\,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6\%/98.6\% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments.

Title: Modeling and Analysis of Land-to-Ship Maritime Wireless Channels at 5.8 GHz
Authors: Shu Sun, Yulu Guo, Meixia Tao, Wei Feng, Jun Chen, Ruifeng Gao, Ye Li, Jue Wang, Theodore S. Rappaport
Abstract: Maritime channel modeling is crucial for designing robust communication systems in marine environments, where factors like waves and wind impact signal propagation. This article investigates land-to-ship maritime wireless channel characteristics at 5.8 GHz based upon an extensive measurement campaign, with concurrent hydrological and meteorological information collection. First, a novel large-scale path loss model with physical foundation and high accuracy is proposed for dynamic marine environments. Then, we introduce the concept of sea-wave-induced fixed-point (SWIFT) fading, a peculiar phenomenon in maritime scenarios that captures the impact of sea surface fluctuations on received power. An enhanced two-ray model incorporating vessel rotational motion is propounded to simulate the SWIFT fading, showing good alignment with measured data, particularly for modest antenna movements. Next, the small-scale fading is studied by leveraging a variety of models including the two-wave with diffuse power (TWDP) and asymmetric Laplace distributions, with the latter performing well in most cases, while TWDP better captures bimodal fading in rough seas. Furthermore, maritime channel sparsity is examined via the Gini index and Rician $K$ factor, and temporal dispersion is characterized. The resulting channel models and parameter characteristics offer valuable insights for maritime wireless system design and deployment.

Title: Fast Feeder Reconfiguration via Mesh Adaptive Direct Search in Black-Box Distribution System Environments
Authors: Junyuan Zheng, Wenlong Shi, Zhaoyu Wang
Abstract: Feeder reconfiguration is a critical operational strategy in power distribution systems. However, existing optimization approaches typically rely on explicit mathematical formulations and analytical models, which are often infeasible in practical utility environments characterized by heterogeneous, proprietary, and black-box simulation modules. To address this challenge, this paper proposes a fast feeder reconfiguration framework based on Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS). The proposed approach requires only performance metric evaluations through simulation modules used for power flow, protection, and voltage regulation analysis. A bi-objective formulation is adopted to jointly minimize active power loss and operational constraint violations. A Pareto-based frontier filter is integrated into the MADS algorithm to efficiently guide the search toward high-quality configurations while systematically pruning dominated solutions. The approach adaptively refines the search space around promising candidates using local polling strategies and convergence aware updates. Case studies on the IEEE-123 node test feeder demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal configurations with significantly fewer evaluations compared to heuristic methods.

Title: Analytical Framework for Power System Strength
Authors: Ignacio Ponce, Federico Milano
Abstract: This paper proposes a general framework to evaluate power system strength. The formulation features twelve indicators, grouped in three dynamical orders, that quantify the resistance of bus voltage phasors and their first and second order rates of change to sudden current injection changes. To quantify such changes the paper introduces a novel finite differentiation technique, that we named Delta operator, able to properly capture "jumps" of algebraic variables and utilizes the recently developed concept of complex frequency. The paper also shows how the proposed framework can be systematically applied to any system device, and provides a variety of examples based on synchronous machines, converters and loads models are given. Numerical results in a benchmark system validate the exactness of the formulation.

Title: The Sustainability of the Leo Orbit Capacity via Risk-Driven Active Debris Removal
Authors: Yacob Medhin, Simone Servadio
Abstract: The growing number of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) jeopardizes long-term orbital sustainability, requiring efficient risk assessment for active debris removal (ADR) missions. This study presents the development and validation of Filtered Modified MITRI (FMM), an enhanced risk index designed to improve the prioritization of high-criticality debris. Leveraging the MOCAT-MC simulation framework, we conducted a comprehensive performance evaluation and sensitivity analysis to probe the robustness of the FMM formulation. The results demonstrate that while the FMM provides superior identification of high-risk targets for annual removal campaigns, a nuanced performance trade-off exists between risk models depending on the operational removal cadence. The analysis also confirms that physically grounded mass terms are indispensable for practical risk assessment. By providing a validated open source tool and critical insights into the dynamics of risk, this research enhances our ability to select optimal ADR targets and ensure the long-term viability of LEO operations.

Title: Distributed Asynchronous Device Speech Enhancement via Windowed Cross-Attention
Authors: Gene-Ping Yang, Sebastian Braun
Abstract: The increasing number of microphone-equipped personal devices offers great flexibility and potential using them as ad-hoc microphone arrays in dynamic meeting environments. However, most existing approaches are designed for time-synchronized microphone setups, a condition that may not hold in real-world meeting scenarios, where time latency and clock drift vary across devices. Under such conditions, we found transform-average-concatenate (TAC), a popular module for neural multi-microphone processing, insufficient in handling time-asynchronous microphones. In response, we propose a windowed cross-attention module capable of dynamically aligning features between all microphones. This module is invariant to both the permutation and the number of microphones and can be easily integrated into existing models. Furthermore, we propose an optimal training target for multi-talker environments. We evaluated our approach in a multi-microphone noisy reverberant setup with unknown time latency and clock drift of each microphone. Experimental results show that our method outperforms TAC on both iFaSNet and CRUSE models, offering faster convergence and improved learning, demonstrating the efficacy of the windowed cross-attention module for asynchronous microphone setups.

Title: MLRU++: Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ with Attention for Efficient 3D Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Nand Kumar Yadav, Rodrigue Rizk, Willium WC Chen, KC (Santosh AI Research Lab, Department of Computer Science and Biomedical and Translational Sciences, Sanford School of Medicine University Of South Dakota, Vermillion, SD, USA.)
Abstract: Accurate and efficient medical image segmentation is crucial but challenging due to anatomical variability and high computational demands on volumetric data. Recent hybrid CNN-Transformer architectures achieve state-of-the-art results but add significant complexity. In this paper, we propose MLRU++, a Multiscale Lightweight Residual UNETR++ architecture designed to balance segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. It introduces two key innovations: a Lightweight Channel and Bottleneck Attention Module (LCBAM) that enhances contextual feature encoding with minimal overhead, and a Multiscale Bottleneck Block (M2B) in the decoder that captures fine-grained details via multi-resolution feature aggregation. Experiments on four publicly available benchmark datasets (Synapse, BTCV, ACDC, and Decathlon Lung) demonstrate that MLRU++ achieves state-of-the-art performance, with average Dice scores of 87.57% (Synapse), 93.00% (ACDC), and 81.12% (Lung). Compared to existing leading models, MLRU++ improves Dice scores by 5.38% and 2.12% on Synapse and ACDC, respectively, while significantly reducing parameter count and computational cost. Ablation studies evaluating LCBAM and M2B further confirm the effectiveness of the proposed architectural components. Results suggest that MLRU++ offers a practical and high-performing solution for 3D medical image segmentation tasks. Source code is available at: this https URL

Title: Meta-Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Movable Antenna-aided Full-Duplex CF-DFRC Systems with Carrier Frequency Offset
Authors: Yue Xiu, Wanting Lyu, You Li, Ran Yang, Phee Lep Yeoh, Wei Zhang, Guangyi Liu, Ning Wei
Abstract: By enabling spectrum sharing between radar and communication operations, the cell-free dual-functional radar-communication (CF-DFRC) system is a promising candidate to significantly improve spectrum efficiency in future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, in wideband scenarios, synchronization errors caused by carrier frequency offset (CFO) can severely reduce both communication capacity and sensing accuracy. To address this challenge, this paper integrates movable antennas (MAs) into the CF-DFRC framework, leveraging their spatial flexibility and adaptive beamforming to dynamically mitigate CFO-induced impairments. To fully exploit the advantages of MAs in wideband scenarios with CFO, we aim to maximize the worst-case sum-rate of communication and sensing by jointly optimizing MA positions, {beamforming}, and CFO parameters, subject to transmit power and MA positioning constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the problem, we propose a robust meta reinforcement learning (MRL)-based two-stage alternating optimization strategy. In the first stage, we employ manifold optimization (MO) with penalty dual decomposition (PDD) to solve the CFO-robust worst-case subproblem. In the second stage, we adopt to jointly optimize {the MA positions and beamforming vectors} in a data-driven manner {for dynamic wireless environments}. Simulation results show that the proposed MRL approach significantly outperforms conventional deep reinforcement learning (DRL) schemes in both communication and sensing performance under CFO impairments. Furthermore, compared to fixed-position antennas (FPAs), the MA-aided CF-DFRC system exhibits

Authors: Jiyue Jiang, Mingtong Chen, Zhengbao Yang
Abstract: This project aims to develop a system to run the object detection model under low power consumption conditions. The detection scene is set as an outdoor traveling scene, and the detection categories include people and vehicles. In this system, users data does not need to be uploaded to the cloud, which is suitable for use in environments with portable needs and strict requirements for data privacy. The MCU device used in this system is STM32H7, which has better performance among low power devices. The YOLOv5 system is selected to train the object detection model. To overcome the resource limitation of the embedded devices, this project uses several model compression techniques such as pruned, quantization, and distillation, which could improve the performance and efficiency of the detection model. Through these processes, the model s computation and the quantity of model parameters could be reduced, in order to run computer vision models on micro-controller devices for the development of embedded vision applications.

Authors: Weijia Peng, Mingtong Chen, Zhengbao Yang
Abstract: As wearable electronics become increasingly prevalent, there is a rise in interest and demand for sustainably designed systems that are also energy self-sufficient. The research described in this paper investigated a shoe-worn energy harvesting system designed use the mechanical energy from walking to output electrical energy. A spring is attached to electromagnetic generator embedded in the heel of the shoe to recover the vertical pressure caused by the foot strike. The simulated prototype consisted of a standard EM generator designed in MATLAB demonstrating a maximum voltage of 12V. The initial low fidelity prototype demonstrated testing the relationship between the EM generator and a simple electrical circuit, with energy output observed. Future research will explore enhancing the overall generator design, integrate a power management IC for battery protect and regulation, and combine the system into a final product, wearable footwear. This research lays a foundation for self-powered footwear and energy independent wearable electronic devices.

Title: Joint Active and Passive Beamforming for Energy-Efficient STARS with Quantization and Element Selection in ISAC Systems
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen, Yi-Hsuan Chiu
Abstract: This paper investigates a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STARS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems in support of full-space energy-efficient data transmissions and target sensing. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem jointly optimizing dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC)-empowered base station (BS) ISAC beamforming and STARS configurations of amplitudes, phase-shifts, quantization levels as well as element selection. Furthermore, relaxed/independent/coupled STARS are considered to examine architectural flexibility. To tackle the non-convex and mixed-integer problem, we propose a joint active-passive beamforming, quantization and element selection (AQUES) scheme based on alternating optimization: Lagrangian dual and Dinkelbach's transformation deals with fractions, whereas successive convex approximation (SCA) convexifies the problem; Penalty dual decomposition (PDD) framework and penalty-based convex-concave programming (PCCP) procedure solves amplitude and phase-shifts; Heuristic search decides the quantization level; Integer relaxation deals with the element selection. Simulation results demonstrate that STARS-ISAC with the proposed AQUES scheme significantly enhances EE while meeting communication rates and sensing quality requirements. The coupled STARS further highlights its superior EE performance over independent and relaxed STARS thanks to its reduced hardware complexity. Moreover, AQUES outperforms existing configurations and benchmark methods in the open literature across various network parameters and deployment scenarios.

Title: Liquid Intelligent Metasurface for Fluid Antennas-Assisted Networks
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel liquid intelligent metasurface (LIM)-assisted downlink multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) system, wherein both the base station (BS) and the metasurface are respectively equipped with fluid antennas (FA) and liquid elements. Unlike conventional reconfigurable metasurface-assisted systems with static geometries, the proposed architecture enables joint electromagnetic and spatial reconfigurability by allowing both the FA-empowered BS (FAS) and LIM to dynamically adjust their small-scale positions in addition to beamforming and phase-shift controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS beamforming, LIM phase-shifts, and the positions of fluid antennas and liquid elements. The problem is highly non-convex due to coupling between variables, fractional expressions, unit-modulus constraints as well as spatial correlation functions. To address these challenges, we adopt alternating optimization and introduce auxiliary variables and employ successive convex approximation (SCA) as well as the penalty convex-concave procedure (PCCP) to solve the respective subproblems. Simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed FAS-LIM architecture significantly outperforms benchmark methods employing conventional fixed metasurface and fixed antenna arrays in terms of various parameter settings.

Title: SFNet: A Spatio-Frequency Domain Deep Learning Network for Efficient Alzheimer's Disease Diagnosis
Authors: Xinyue Yang, Meiliang Liu, Yunfang Xu, Xiaoxiao Yang, Zhengye Si, Zijin Li, Zhiwen Zhao
Abstract: Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder that predominantly affects the elderly population and currently has no cure. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), as a non-invasive imaging technique, is essential for the early diagnosis of AD. MRI inherently contains both spatial and frequency information, as raw signals are acquired in the frequency domain and reconstructed into spatial images via the Fourier transform. However, most existing AD diagnostic models extract features from a single domain, limiting their capacity to fully capture the complex neuroimaging characteristics of the disease. While some studies have combined spatial and frequency information, they are mostly confined to 2D MRI, leaving the potential of dual-domain analysis in 3D MRI unexplored. To overcome this limitation, we propose Spatio-Frequency Network (SFNet), the first end-to-end deep learning framework that simultaneously leverages spatial and frequency domain information to enhance 3D MRI-based AD diagnosis. SFNet integrates an enhanced dense convolutional network to extract local spatial features and a global frequency module to capture global frequency-domain representations. Additionally, a novel multi-scale attention module is proposed to further refine spatial feature extraction. Experiments on the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ANDI) dataset demonstrate that SFNet outperforms existing baselines and reduces computational overhead in classifying cognitively normal (CN) and AD, achieving an accuracy of 95.1%.

Title: The Bode Plots for Sliding-Mode Control Design
Authors: Ulises Pérez-Ventura
Abstract: This paper develops a unified frequency-domain framework for the analysis of sliding-mode control systems, encompassing both discontinuous and Lipschitz-continuous implementations. Using describing function (DF) theory, closed-form expressions are derived for the amplitude and frequency of chattering oscillations, as well as equivalent gain (EG) models that enable closed-loop sensitivity analysis. The proposed methodology captures the influence of actuator dynamics, control parameters, and disturbance profiles on steady-state performance. Theoretical predictions for bias and oscillatory components are validated through simulations under both constant and sinusoidal perturbations. In the low-frequency regime, the EG-based sensitivity functions accurately predict the amplitude and phase of the system response, with tracking errors remaining within a 15\% margin, provided that the DF assumptions hold. The framework also incorporates orbital stability considerations via Loebs criterion, ensuring that chattering remains bounded. Overall, the results offer practical insight into the robust design of sliding-mode controllers, enabling systematic gain tuning that balances disturbance rejection and chattering attenuation, while accounting for actuator and sensor constraints.

Title: Polarforming Design for Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Zijian Zhou, Jingze Ding, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Polarforming has emerged as a promising technique to enable the antenna to shape its polarization into a desired state for aligning with that of the received electromagnetic (EM) wave or reconfiguring that of the transmitted EM wave. In this letter, we investigate polarforming design for the movable antenna (MA)-enabled communication system. Specifically, we consider a single-input single-output (SISO) system with reconfigurable antenna positions and polarizations to leverage both spatial and polarization degrees of freedom (DoFs). First, we present a polarized channel model and characterize the channel response as a function of antenna positions and polarforming phase shifts. To maximize the achievable rate of the proposed system, we then develop a successive convex approximation (SCA)-based optimization algorithm by iteratively optimizing the antenna positions and phase shifts at both the transmitter and receiver. Furthermore, simulation results demonstrate the performance gains of the proposed system over conventional systems in mitigating channel depolarization and adapting to channel fading.

Title: Physics-Driven Neural Network for Solving Electromagnetic Inverse Scattering Problems
Authors: Yutong Du, Zicheng Liu, Bazargul Matkerim, Changyou Li, Yali Zong, Bo Qi, Jingwei Kou
Abstract: In recent years, deep learning-based methods have been proposed for solving inverse scattering problems (ISPs), but most of them heavily rely on data and suffer from limited generalization capabilities. In this paper, a new solving scheme is proposed where the solution is iteratively updated following the updating of the physics-driven neural network (PDNN), the hyperparameters of which are optimized by minimizing the loss function which incorporates the constraints from the collected scattered fields and the prior information about scatterers. Unlike data-driven neural network solvers, PDNN is trained only requiring the input of collected scattered fields and the computation of scattered fields corresponding to predicted solutions, thus avoids the generalization problem. Moreover, to accelerate the imaging efficiency, the subregion enclosing the scatterers is identified. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme has high reconstruction accuracy and strong stability, even when dealing with composite lossy scatterers.

Authors: Jinquan Guan, Junhong Guo, Qi Chen, Jian Chen, Yongkang Cai, Yilin He, Zhiquan Huang, Yan Wang, Yutong Xie
Abstract: Oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) is a prevalent and aggressive malignancy where deep learning-based computer-aided diagnosis and prognosis can enhance clinical this http URL, existing publicly available OSCC datasets often suffer from limited patient cohorts and a restricted focus on either diagnostic or prognostic tasks, limiting the development of comprehensive and generalizable models. To bridge this gap, we introduce Multi-OSCC, a new histopathology image dataset comprising 1,325 OSCC patients, integrating both diagnostic and prognostic information to expand existing public resources. Each patient is represented by six high resolution histopathology images captured at x200, x400, and x1000 magnifications-two per magnification-covering both the core and edge tumor this http URL Multi-OSCC dataset is richly annotated for six critical clinical tasks: recurrence prediction (REC), lymph node metastasis (LNM), tumor differentiation (TD), tumor invasion (TI), cancer embolus (CE), and perineural invasion (PI). To benchmark this dataset, we systematically evaluate the impact of different visual encoders, multi-image fusion techniques, stain normalization, and multi-task learning frameworks. Our analysis yields several key insights: (1) The top-performing models achieve excellent results, with an Area Under the Curve (AUC) of 94.72% for REC and 81.23% for TD, while all tasks surpass 70% AUC; (2) Stain normalization benefits diagnostic tasks but negatively affects recurrence prediction; (3) Multi-task learning incurs a 3.34% average AUC degradation compared to single-task models in our multi-task benchmark, underscoring the challenge of balancing multiple tasks in our dataset. To accelerate future research, we publicly release the Multi-OSCC dataset and baseline models at this https URL.

Title: Latency Minimization Oriented Radio and Computation Resource Allocations for 6G V2X Networks with ISCC
Authors: Peng Liu, Xinyi Wang, Zesong Fei, Yuan Wu, Jie Xu, Arumugam Nallanathan
Abstract: Incorporating mobile edge computing (MEC) and integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a promising technology to enable integrated sensing, communication, and computing (ISCC) in the sixth generation (6G) networks. ISCC is particularly attractive for vehicle-to-everything (V2X) applications, where vehicles perform ISAC to sense the environment and simultaneously offload the sensing data to roadside base stations (BSs) for remote processing. In this paper, we investigate a particular ISCC-enabled V2X system consisting of multiple multi-antenna BSs serving a set of single-antenna vehicles, in which the vehicles perform their respective ISAC operations (for simultaneous sensing and offloading to the associated BS) over orthogonal sub-bands. With the focus on fairly minimizing the sensing completion latency for vehicles while ensuring the detection probability constraints, we jointly optimize the allocations of radio resources (i.e., the sub-band allocation, transmit power control at vehicles, and receive beamforming at BSs) as well as computation resources at BS MEC servers. To solve the formulated complex mixed-integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) problem, we propose an alternating optimization algorithm. In this algorithm, we determine the sub-band allocation via the branch-and-bound method, optimize the transmit power control via successive convex approximation (SCA), and derive the receive beamforming and computation resource allocation at BSs in closed form based on generalized Rayleigh entropy and fairness criteria, respectively. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed joint resource allocation design significantly reduces the maximum task completion latency among all vehicles. Furthermore, we also demonstrate several interesting trade-offs between the system performance and resource utilizations.

Title: Derivative-Agnostic Inference of Nonlinear Hybrid Systems
Authors: Hengzhi Yu, Bohan Ma, Mingshuai Chen, Jie An, Bin Gu, Naijun Zhan, Jianwei Yin
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of inferring a hybrid automaton from a set of input-output traces of a hybrid system exhibiting discrete mode switching between continuously evolving dynamics. Existing approaches mainly adopt a derivative-based method where (i) the occurrence of mode switching is determined by a drastic variation in derivatives and (ii) the clustering of trace segments relies on signal similarity -- both subject to user-supplied thresholds. We present a derivative-agnostic approach, named Dainarx, to infer nonlinear hybrid systems where the dynamics are captured by nonlinear autoregressive exogenous (NARX) models. Dainarx employs NARX models as a unified, threshold-free representation through the detection of mode switching and trace-segment clustering. We show that Dainarx suffices to learn models that closely approximate a general class of hybrid systems featuring high-order nonlinear dynamics with exogenous inputs, nonlinear guard conditions, and linear resets. Experimental results on a collection of benchmarks indicate that our approach can effectively and efficiently infer nontrivial hybrid automata with high-order dynamics yielding significantly more accurate approximations than state-of-the-art techniques.

Title: An approach to measuring the performance of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) models in the context of Large Language Model (LLM) powered applications
Authors: Sujith Pulikodan, Sahapthan K, Prasanta Kumar Ghosh, Visruth Sanka, Nihar Desai
Abstract: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) plays a crucial role in human-machine interaction and serves as an interface for a wide range of applications. Traditionally, ASR performance has been evaluated using Word Error Rate (WER), a metric that quantifies the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions in the generated transcriptions. However, with the increasing adoption of large and powerful Large Language Models (LLMs) as the core processing component in various applications, the significance of different types of ASR errors in downstream tasks warrants further exploration. In this work, we analyze the capabilities of LLMs to correct errors introduced by ASRs and propose a new measure to evaluate ASR performance for LLM-powered applications.

Title: Arbitrage Tactics in the Local Markets via Hierarchical Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Haoyang Zhang, Mina Montazeri, Philipp Heer, Koen Kok, Nikolaos G. Paterakis
Abstract: Strategic bidding tactics employed by prosumers in local markets, including the Local Electricity Market (LEM) and Local Flexibility Market (LFM), have attracted significant attention due to their potential to enhance economic benefits for market participants through optimized energy management and bidding. While existing research has explored strategic bidding in a single market with multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) algorithms, arbitrage opportunities across local markets remain unexplored. This paper introduces a hierarchical MARL (HMARL) algorithm designed to enable aggregator arbitrage across multiple local markets. The strategic behavior of these aggregators in local markets is modeled as a two-stage Markov game: the first stage involves the LEM, while the second stage encompasses both the LFM and the balancing market. To solve this two-stage Markov game, the HMARL framework assigns two sub-agents to each aggregator, a primary sub-agent and a secondary sub-agent. Without the arbitrage strategy, these sub-agents operate in silos, with the primary sub-agent focusing on first-stage profits and the secondary sub-agent on second-stage profits, each employing independent MARLs. On the contrary, when implementing the arbitrage strategy with the proposed HMARL, the sub-agents communicate and coordinate to perform arbitrage across multiple local markets, enhancing overall efficiency. The case study, conducted under a scenario where all aggregators employ the arbitrage strategy, shows that despite higher initial costs in the LEM, this strategy generates substantial savings in the LFM and the balancing market, resulting in a total profit increase of $40.6\%$ on average. This highlights the capability of the proposed HMARL to address the two-stage Markov game and facilitate arbitrage across local markets, thereby enhancing profitability for participants.

Title: Graphical Analysis of Nonlinear Multivariable Feedback Systems
Authors: Julius P. J. Krebbekx, Roland Tóth, Amritam Das
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency-domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. There have been recent efforts to generalize SRG analysis to Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems. However, these attempts yielded only results for square systems, and in some cases, only methods applicable for Linear Time-Invariant (LTI) systems. In this paper, we develop a complete SRG framework for the analysis of MIMO systems, which may be nonlinear and non-square. The key element is the embedding of operators to a space of operators acting on a common Hilbert space, while restricting the input space to the original input dimension. We develop interconnection rules that use restricted input spaces and stability theorems to guarantee causality, well-posedness and (incremental) $L_2$-gain bounds for the overall interconnection. We show utilization of the proposed theoretical concepts on the analysis of nonlinear systems in a linear fractional representation form, which is a rather general class of systems with a representation form directly utilizable for control. Moreover, we provide formulas for the computation of MIMO SRGs of stable LTI operators and diagonal static nonlinear operators. Finally, we demonstrate the capabilities of our proposed approach on several examples.

Title: A Distributed Actor-Critic Algorithm for Fixed-Time Consensus in Nonlinear Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Aria Delshad, Maryam Babazadeh
Abstract: This paper proposes a reinforcement learning (RL)-based backstepping control strategy to achieve fixed time consensus in nonlinear multi-agent systems with strict feedback dynamics. Agents exchange only output information with their neighbors over a directed communication graph, without requiring full state measurements or symmetric communication. Achieving fixed time consensus, where convergence occurs within a pre-specified time bound that is independent of initial conditions is faced with significant challenges due to the presence of unknown nonlinearities, inter-agent couplings, and external disturbances. This work addresses these challenges by integrating actor critic reinforcement learning with a novel fixed time adaptation mechanism. Each agent employs an actor critic architecture supported by two estimator networks designed to handle system uncertainties and unknown perturbations. The adaptation laws are developed to ensure that all agents track the leader within a fixed time regardless of their initial conditions. The consensus and tracking errors are guaranteed to converge to a small neighborhood of the origin, with the convergence radius adjustable through control parameters. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach and highlight its advantages over state-of-the-art methods in terms of convergence speed and robustness.

Title: Hybrid RISs for Simultaneous Tunable Reflections and Sensing
Authors: George C. Alexandropoulos, Nir Shlezinger, Ioannis Gavras, Haiyang Zhang
Abstract: The concept of smart wireless environments envisions dynamic programmable propagation of information-bearing signals through the deployment of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs). Typical RIS implementations include metasurfaces with passive unit elements capable to reflect their incident waves in controllable ways. However, this solely reflective operation induces significant challenges in the RIS orchestration from the wireless network. For example, channel estimation, which is essential for coherent RIS-empowered wireless communications, is quite challenging with the available solely reflecting RIS designs. This chapter reviews the emerging concept of Hybrid Reflecting and Sensing RISs (HRISs), which enables metasurfaces to reflect the impinging signal in a controllable manner, while simultaneously sensing a portion of it. The sensing capability of HRISs facilitates various network management functionalities, including channel parameter estimation and localization, while, most importantly, giving rise to computationally autonomous and self-configuring RISs. The implementation details of HRISs are first presented, which are then followed by a convenient mathematical model for characterizing their dual functionality. Then, two indicative applications of HRISs are discussed, one for simultaneous communications and sensing and another that showcases their usefulness for estimating the individual channels in the uplink of a multi-user HRIS-empowered communication system. For both of these applications, performance evaluation results are included validating the role of HRISs for sensing as well as integrated sensing and communications.

Title: Integral action for bilinear systems with application to counter current heat exchanger
Authors: Francesco Ripa, Daniele Astolfi, Boussad Hamroun, Diego Regruto
Abstract: In this study, we propose a robust control strategy for a counter-current heat exchanger. The primary objective is to regulate the outlet temperature of one fluid stream by manipulating the flow rate of the second counter-current fluid stream. By leveraging the energy balance equations, we develop a structured bilinear system model derived by using a uniform spatial discretization of each stream into a cascade of homogeneous volumes and by considering the heat transfer and convective phenomena within the exchanger. We introduce three control strategies: (i) an enhanced forwarding-based controller, (ii) an output feedback controller incorporating a state observer, and (iii) a purely integral control law. The effectiveness of the proposed control strategy is validated through real experiments on a real heat exchanger.

Title: Semantic Segmentation for Preoperative Planning in Transcatheter Aortic Valve Replacement
Authors: Cedric Zöllner, Simon Reiß, Alexander Jaus, Amroalalaa Sholi, Ralf Sodian, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: When preoperative planning for surgeries is conducted on the basis of medical images, artificial intelligence methods can support medical doctors during assessment. In this work, we consider medical guidelines for preoperative planning of the transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) and identify tasks, that may be supported via semantic segmentation models by making relevant anatomical structures measurable in computed tomography scans. We first derive fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels from coarse-grained anatomical information, in order to train segmentation models and quantify how well they are able to find these structures in the scans. Furthermore, we propose an adaptation to the loss function in training these segmentation models and through this achieve a +1.27% Dice increase in performance. Our fine-grained TAVR-relevant pseudo-labels and the computed tomography scans we build upon are available at this https URL.

Title: Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model for Imaging Synthesis
Authors: Xiaojiao Xiao, Qinmin Vivian Hu, Guanghui Wang
Abstract: Medical image synthesis plays a crucial role in clinical workflows, addressing the common issue of missing imaging modalities due to factors such as extended scan times, scan corruption, artifacts, patient motion, and intolerance to contrast agents. The paper presents a novel image synthesis network, the Pyramid Hierarchical Masked Diffusion Model (PHMDiff), which employs a multi-scale hierarchical approach for more detailed control over synthesizing high-quality images across different resolutions and layers. Specifically, this model utilizes randomly multi-scale high-proportion masks to speed up diffusion model training, and balances detail fidelity and overall structure. The integration of a Transformer-based Diffusion model process incorporates cross-granularity regularization, modeling the mutual information consistency across each granularity's latent spaces, thereby enhancing pixel-level perceptual accuracy. Comprehensive experiments on two challenging datasets demonstrate that PHMDiff achieves superior performance in both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) and Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), highlighting its capability to produce high-quality synthesized images with excellent structural integrity. Ablation studies further confirm the contributions of each component. Furthermore, the PHMDiff model, a multi-scale image synthesis framework across and within medical imaging modalities, shows significant advantages over other methods.

Title: A Tutorial on MRI Reconstruction: From Modern Methods to Clinical Implications
Authors: Tolga Çukur, Salman U. H. Dar, Valiyeh Ansarian Nezhad, Yohan Jun, Tae Hyung Kim, Shohei Fujita, Berkin Bilgic
Abstract: MRI is an indispensable clinical tool, offering a rich variety of tissue contrasts to support broad diagnostic and research applications. Clinical exams routinely acquire multiple structural sequences that provide complementary information for differential diagnosis, while research protocols often incorporate advanced functional, diffusion, spectroscopic, and relaxometry sequences to capture multidimensional insights into tissue structure and composition. However, these capabilities come at the cost of prolonged scan times, which reduce patient throughput, increase susceptibility to motion artifacts, and may require trade-offs in image quality or diagnostic scope. Over the last two decades, advances in image reconstruction algorithms--alongside improvements in hardware and pulse sequence design--have made it possible to accelerate acquisitions while preserving diagnostic quality. Central to this progress is the ability to incorporate prior information to regularize the solutions to the reconstruction problem. In this tutorial, we overview the basics of MRI reconstruction and highlight state-of-the-art approaches, beginning with classical methods that rely on explicit hand-crafted priors, and then turning to deep learning methods that leverage a combination of learned and crafted priors to further push the performance envelope. We also explore the translational aspects and eventual clinical implications of these methods. We conclude by discussing future directions to address remaining challenges in MRI reconstruction. The tutorial is accompanied by a Python toolbox (this https URL) to demonstrate select methods discussed in the article.

Authors: Dayu Fan, Rui Meng, Xiaodong Xu, Yiming Liu, Guoshun Nan, Chenyuan Feng, Shujun Han, Song Gao, Bingxuan Xu, Dusit Niyato, Tony Q. S. Quek, Ping Zhang
Abstract: With the rapid development of Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) technology, Generative Diffusion Models (GDMs) have shown significant empowerment potential in the field of wireless networks due to advantages, such as noise resistance, training stability, controllability, and multimodal generation. Although there have been multiple studies focusing on GDMs for wireless networks, there is still a lack of comprehensive reviews on their technological evolution. Motivated by this, we systematically explore the application of GDMs in wireless networks. Firstly, starting from mathematical principles, we analyze technical advantages of GDMs and present six representative models. Furthermore, we propose the multi-layer wireless network architecture including sensing layer, transmission layer, application layer, and security plane. We also introduce the core mechanisms of GDM at each of the layers. Subsequently, we conduct a rigorous review on existing GDM-based schemes, with a focus on analyzing their innovative points, the role of GDMs, strengths, and weaknesses. Ultimately, we extract key challenges and provide potential solutions, with the aim of providing directional guidance for future research in this field.

Title: Dynamic Activation and Assignment of SDN Controllers in LEO Satellite Constellations
Authors: Wafa Hasanain, Pablo G. Madoery, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Gunes Karabulut Kurt, Sameera Siddiqui, Stephane Martel, Khaled Ahmed, Colin Bellinger
Abstract: Software-defined networking (SDN) has emerged as a promising approach for managing traditional satellite communication. This enhances opportunities for future services, including integrating satellite and terrestrial networks. In this paper, we have developed an SDN-enabled framework for Low Earth Orbit (LEO) satellite networks, incorporating the OpenFlow protocol, all within an OMNeT++ simulation environment. Dynamic controller assignment is one of the most significant challenges for large LEO constellations. Due to the movement of LEO satellites, satellite-controller assignments must be updated frequently to maintain low propagation delays. To address this issue, we present a dynamic satellite-to-controller assignment (DSCA) optimization problem that continuously adjusts these assignments. Our optimal DSCA (Opt-DSCA) approach minimizes propagation delay and optimizes the number of active controllers. Our preliminary results demonstrate that the DSCA approach significantly outperforms the static satellite-to-controller assignment (SSCA) approach. While SSCA may perform better with more controllers, this scheme fails to adapt to satellite movements. Our DSCA approach consistently improves network efficiency by dynamically reassigning satellites based on propagation delays. Further, we found diminishing returns when the number of controllers is increased beyond a certain point, suggesting optimal performance with a limited number of controllers. Opt-DSCA lowers propagation delays and improves network performance by optimizing satellite assignments and reducing active controllers.

Title: Improving U-Net Confidence on TEM Image Data with L2-Regularization, Transfer Learning, and Deep Fine-Tuning
Authors: Aiden Ochoa, Xinyuan Xu, Xing Wang
Abstract: With ever-increasing data volumes, it is essential to develop automated approaches for identifying nanoscale defects in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images. However, compared to features in conventional photographs, nanoscale defects in TEM images exhibit far greater variation due to the complex contrast mechanisms and intricate defect structures. These challenges often result in much less labeled data and higher rates of annotation errors, posing significant obstacles to improving machine learning model performance for TEM image analysis. To address these limitations, we examined transfer learning by leveraging large, pre-trained models used for natural images. We demonstrated that by using the pre-trained encoder and L2-regularization, semantically complex features are ignored in favor of simpler, more reliable cues, substantially improving the model performance. However, this improvement cannot be captured by conventional evaluation metrics such as F1-score, which can be skewed by human annotation errors treated as ground truth. Instead, we introduced novel evaluation metrics that are independent of the annotation accuracy. Using grain boundary detection in UO2 TEM images as a case study, we found that our approach led to a 57% improvement in defect detection rate, which is a robust and holistic measure of model performance on the TEM dataset used in this work. Finally, we showed that model self-confidence is only achieved through transfer learning and fine-tuning of very deep layers.

Title: MultiTaskDeltaNet: Change Detection-based Image Segmentation for Operando ETEM with Application to Carbon Gasification Kinetics
Authors: Yushuo Niu, Tianyu Li, Yuanyuan Zhu, Qian Yang
Abstract: Transforming in-situ transmission electron microscopy (TEM) imaging into a tool for spatially-resolved operando characterization of solid-state reactions requires automated, high-precision semantic segmentation of dynamically evolving features. However, traditional deep learning methods for semantic segmentation often encounter limitations due to the scarcity of labeled data, visually ambiguous features of interest, and small-object scenarios. To tackle these challenges, we introduce MultiTaskDeltaNet (MTDN), a novel deep learning architecture that creatively reconceptualizes the segmentation task as a change detection problem. By implementing a unique Siamese network with a U-Net backbone and using paired images to capture feature changes, MTDN effectively utilizes minimal data to produce high-quality segmentations. Furthermore, MTDN utilizes a multi-task learning strategy to leverage correlations between physical features of interest. In an evaluation using data from in-situ environmental TEM (ETEM) videos of filamentous carbon gasification, MTDN demonstrated a significant advantage over conventional segmentation models, particularly in accurately delineating fine structural features. Notably, MTDN achieved a 10.22% performance improvement over conventional segmentation models in predicting small and visually ambiguous physical features. This work bridges several key gaps between deep learning and practical TEM image analysis, advancing automated characterization of nanomaterials in complex experimental settings.

Title: Nonlinear Framework for Speech Bandwidth Extension
Authors: Tarikul Islam Tamiti, Nursad Mamun, Anomadarshi Barua
Abstract: Recovering high-frequency components lost to bandwidth constraints is crucial for applications ranging from telecommunications to high-fidelity audio on limited resources. We introduce NDSI-BWE, a new adversarial Band Width Extension (BWE) framework that leverage four new discriminators inspired by nonlinear dynamical system to capture diverse temporal behaviors: a Multi-Resolution Lyapunov Discriminator (MRLD) for determining sensitivity to initial conditions by capturing deterministic chaos, a Multi-Scale Recurrence Discriminator (MS-RD) for self-similar recurrence dynamics, a Multi-Scale Detrended Fractal Analysis Discriminator (MSDFA) for long range slow variant scale invariant relationship, a Multi-Resolution Poincaré Plot Discriminator (MR-PPD) for capturing hidden latent space relationship, a Multi-Period Discriminator (MPD) for cyclical patterns, a Multi-Resolution Amplitude Discriminator (MRAD) and Multi-Resolution Phase Discriminator (MRPD) for capturing intricate amplitude-phase transition statistics. By using depth-wise convolution at the core of the convolutional block with in each discriminators, NDSI-BWE attains an eight-times parameter reduction. These seven discriminators guide a complex-valued ConformerNeXt based genetor with a dual stream Lattice-Net based architecture for simultaneous refinement of magnitude and phase. The genertor leverage the transformer based conformer's global dependency modeling and ConvNeXt block's local temporal modeling capability. Across six objective evaluation metrics and subjective based texts comprises of five human judges, NDSI-BWE establishes a new SoTA in BWE.

Abstract: This work introduces a stop-band energy constraint for filters in orthogonal tunable wavelet units with a lattice structure, aimed at improving image classification and anomaly detection in CNNs, especially on texture-rich datasets. Integrated into ResNet-18, the method enhances convolution, pooling, and downsampling operations, yielding accuracy gains of 2.48% on CIFAR-10 and 13.56% on the Describable Textures dataset.

Title: Universal Wavelet Units in 3D Retinal Layer Segmentation
Authors: An D. Le, Hung Nguyen, Melanie Tran, Jesse Most, Dirk-Uwe G. Bartsch, William R Freeman, Shyamanga Borooah, Truong Q. Nguyen, Cheolhong An
Abstract: This paper presents the first study to apply tunable wavelet units (UwUs) for 3D retinal layer segmentation from Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT) volumes. To overcome the limitations of conventional max-pooling, we integrate three wavelet-based downsampling modules, OrthLattUwU, BiorthLattUwU, and LS-BiorthLattUwU, into a motion-corrected MGU-Net architecture. These modules use learnable lattice filter banks to preserve both low- and high-frequency features, enhancing spatial detail and structural consistency. Evaluated on the Jacobs Retina Center (JRC) OCT dataset, our framework shows significant improvement in accuracy and Dice score, particularly with LS-BiorthLattUwU, highlighting the benefits of tunable wavelet filters in volumetric medical image segmentation.

Title: SDBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark Suite for Speaker Diarization
Authors: Eduardo Pacheco, Atila Orhon, Berkin Durmus, Blaise Munyampirwa, Andrey Leonov
Abstract: Even state-of-the-art speaker diarization systems exhibit high variance in error rates across different datasets, representing numerous use cases and domains. Furthermore, comparing across systems requires careful application of best practices such as dataset splits and metric definitions to allow for apples-to-apples comparison. We propose SDBench (Speaker Diarization Benchmark), an open-source benchmark suite that integrates 13 diverse datasets with built-in tooling for consistent and fine-grained analysis of speaker diarization performance for various on-device and server-side systems. SDBench enables reproducible evaluation and easy integration of new systems over time. To demonstrate the efficacy of SDBench, we built SpeakerKit, an inference efficiency-focused system built on top of Pyannote v3. SDBench enabled rapid execution of ablation studies that led to SpeakerKit being 9.6x faster than Pyannote v3 while achieving comparable error rates. We benchmark 6 state-of-the-art systems including Deepgram, AWS Transcribe, and Pyannote AI API, revealing important trade-offs between accuracy and speed.

Title: Nd3+ Doping-induced Leakage Currents Suppression in High-temperature 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 Lead-free Piezoceramics
Authors: Jinming Liu, Mingtong Chen, Zhengbao Yang
Abstract: BiFeO3 has attracted much attention as a potential candidate for replacing conventional, lead based piezoelectric materials due to its remarkable spontaneous polarization and high Curie temperature. However, its inherent high leakage currents, which lead to low piezoelectric response and poor temperature stability, have severely limited its practical applications. In this study, lead free piezoelectric ceramics of the 0.7BiFeO3-0.3BaTiO3 (BF-BT) system were prepared, and their microstructures along with high-temperature electrical performance were modulated by introducing Nd3+. The results indicate that moderate Nd doping improves lattice symmetry and reduces oxygen vacancy-related defect dipoles, thereby effectively suppressing leakage currents at temperatures above 75°C. The Nddoped samples exhibit significantly lower leakage current densities, reduced by over 99% compared to the undoped ceramics, reaching values as low as 10-5Acm-2. They also show higher resistivity under elevated temperatures and electric fields, offering notable improvements in thermal stability over the undoped counterparts. In addition, the Nd-doped samples achieved piezoelectric coefficients as high as 172 pC N -1 at room temperature while still maintaining high dielectric and piezoelectric responses at elevated temperatures. This work not only provides an effective way to solve the leakage current problem of BF-BT ceramics in high temperature applications but also indicates a new design strategy for optimizing the high temperature stability of lead free piezoelectric materials, which shows a broad application prospect in the field of high-temperature sensors and actuators.

Title: LABNet: A Lightweight Attentive Beamforming Network for Ad-hoc Multichannel Microphone Invariant Real-Time Speech Enhancement
Authors: Haoyin Yan, Jie Zhang, Chengqian Jiang, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: Multichannel speech enhancement (SE) aims to restore clean speech from noisy measurements by leveraging spatiotemporal signal features. In ad-hoc array conditions, microphone invariance (MI) requires systems to handle different microphone numbers and array geometries. From a practical perspective, multichannel recordings inevitably increase the computational burden for edge-device applications, highlighting the necessity of lightweight and efficient deployments. In this work, we propose a lightweight attentive beamforming network (LABNet) to integrate MI in a low-complexity real-time SE system. We design a three-stage framework for efficient intra-channel modeling and inter-channel interaction. A cross-channel attention module is developed to aggregate features from each channel selectively. Experimental results demonstrate our LABNet achieves impressive performance with ultra-light resource overhead while maintaining the MI, indicating great potential for ad-hoc array processing.

Title: CHIMERA: Compressed Hybrid Intelligence for Twin-Model Enhanced Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning for Multi-Functional RIS-Assisted Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen, Jyun-Jhe Huang
Abstract: A space-air-ground integrated network (SAGIN) architecture is proposed, empowered by multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (MF-RIS) capable of simultaneously reflecting, amplifying, and harvesting wireless energy. The MF-RIS plays a pivotal role in addressing the energy shortages of low-Earth orbit (LEO) satellites operating in shadowed regions, while explicitly accounting for both communication and computing energy consumption across the SAGIN nodes. To maximize the long-term energy efficiency (EE), we formulate a joint optimization problem over the MF-RIS parameters, including signal amplification, phase-shifts, energy harvesting ratio, and active element selection as well as the SAGIN parameters of beamforming vectors, high-altitude platform station (HAPS) deployment, user association, and computing capability. The formulated problem is highly non-convex and non-linear and contains mixed discrete-continuous parameters. To tackle this, we conceive a compressed hybrid intelligence for twin-model enhanced multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (CHIMERA) framework, which integrates semantic state-action compression and parametrized sharing under hybrid reinforcement learning to efficiently explore suitable complex actions. The simulation results have demonstrated that the proposed CHIMERA scheme substantially outperforms the conventional benchmarks, including fixed-configuration or non-harvesting MF-RIS, traditional RIS, and no-RIS cases, as well as centralized and multi-agent deep reinforcement learning baselines in terms of the highest EE. Moreover, the proposed SAGIN-MF-RIS architecture achieves superior EE performance due to its complementary coverage, offering notable advantages over either standalone satellite, aerial, or ground-only deployments.

Title: Unbeatable imitation of a friend
Authors: Masahiko Ueda
Abstract: Imitation sometimes achieves success in multi-agent situations even though it is very simple. In game theory, success of imitation has been characterized by unbeatability against other agents. Previous studies specified conditions under which imitation is unbeatable in repeated games, and clarified that the existence of unbeatable imitation is strongly related to the existence of payoff-controlling strategies, called zero-determinant strategies. However, the previous studies mainly focused on ``imitation of opponents''. It was pointed out that imitation of other players in the same group and imitation of other players in the same role in other groups generally result in different outcomes. Here, we investigate the existence condition of unbeatable imitation in the latter ``imitation of friends'' situations. We find that it is stronger than the existence condition of unbeatable zero-determinant strategies, whereas both are very limited. Our findings suggest a strong relation between them even in the `imitation of friends'' situations.

Title: DASPack: Controlled Data Compression for Distributed Acoustic Sensing
Authors: Aleix Segui, Arantza Ugalde, Andreas Fichtner, Sergi Ventosa, Josep Ramon Morros
Abstract: We present DASPack, a high-performance, open-source compression tool specifically designed for distributed acoustic sensing (DAS) data. As DAS becomes a key technology for real-time, high-density, and long-range monitoring in fields such as geophysics, infrastructure surveillance, and environmental sensing, the volume of collected data is rapidly increasing. Large-scale DAS deployments already generate hundreds of terabytes and are expected to increase in the coming years, making long-term storage a major challenge. Despite this urgent need, few compression methods have proven to be both practical and scalable in real-world scenarios. DASPack is a fully operational solution that consistently outperforms existing techniques for DAS data. It enables both controlled lossy and lossless compression by allowing users to choose the maximum absolute difference per datum between the original and compressed data. The compression pipeline combines wavelet transforms, linear predictive coding, and entropy coding to optimise efficiency. Our method achieves up to 3x file size reductions for strain and strain rate data in lossless mode across diverse datasets. In lossy mode, compression improves to 6x with near-perfect signal fidelity, and up to 10x is reached with acceptable signal degradation. It delivers fast throughput (100-200 MB/s using a single-thread and up to 750 MB/s using 8-threads), enabling real-time deployment even under high data rates. We validated its performance on 15 datasets from a variety of acquisition environments, demonstrating its speed, robustness, and broad applicability. DASPack provides a practical foundation for long-term, sustainable DAS data management in large-scale monitoring networks.

Title: RIS-aided Latent Space Alignment for Semantic Channel Equalization
Authors: Tomás Hüttebräucker, Mario Edoardo Pandolfo, Simone Fiorellino, Emilio Calvanese Strinati, Paolo Di Lorenzo
Abstract: Semantic communication systems introduce a new paradigm in wireless communications, focusing on transmitting the intended meaning rather than ensuring strict bit-level accuracy. These systems often rely on Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to learn and encode meaning directly from data, enabling more efficient communication. However, in multi-user settings where interacting agents are trained independently-without shared context or joint optimization-divergent latent representations across AI-native devices can lead to semantic mismatches, impeding mutual understanding even in the absence of traditional transmission errors. In this work, we address semantic mismatch in Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) channels by proposing a joint physical and semantic channel equalization framework that leverages the presence of Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS). The semantic equalization is implemented as a sequence of transformations: (i) a pre-equalization stage at the transmitter; (ii) propagation through the RIS-aided channel; and (iii) a post-equalization stage at the receiver. We formulate the problem as a constrained Minimum Mean Squared Error (MMSE) optimization and propose two solutions: (i) a linear semantic equalization chain, and (ii) a non-linear DNN-based semantic equalizer. Both methods are designed to operate under semantic compression in the latent space and adhere to transmit power constraints. Through extensive evaluations, we show that the proposed joint equalization strategies consistently outperform conventional, disjoint approaches to physical and semantic channel equalization across a broad range of scenarios and wireless channel conditions.

Title: Distributed Oscillatory Guidance for Formation Flight of Fixed-Wing Drones
Authors: Yang Xu, Jesús Bautista, José Hinojosa, Héctor García de Marina
Abstract: The autonomous formation flight of fixed-wing drones is hard when the coordination requires the actuation over their speeds since they are critically bounded and aircraft are mostly designed to fly at a nominal airspeed. This paper proposes an algorithm to achieve formation flights of fixed-wing drones without requiring any actuation over their speed. In particular, we guide all the drones to travel over specific paths, e.g., parallel straight lines, and we superpose an oscillatory behavior onto the guiding vector field that drives the drones to the paths. This oscillation enables control over the average velocity along the path, thereby facilitating inter-drone coordination. Each drone adjusts its oscillation amplitude distributively in a closed-loop manner by communicating with neighboring agents in an undirected and connected graph. A novel consensus algorithm is introduced, leveraging a non-negative, asymmetric saturation function. This unconventional saturation is justified since negative amplitudes do not make drones travel backward or have a negative velocity along the path. Rigorous theoretical analysis of the algorithm is complemented by validation through numerical simulations and a real-world formation flight.

Title: Adaptive Bayesian Single-Shot Quantum Sensing
Authors: Ivana Nikoloska, Ruud Van Sloun, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Quantum sensing harnesses the unique properties of quantum systems to enable precision measurements of physical quantities such as time, magnetic and electric fields, acceleration, and gravitational gradients well beyond the limits of classical sensors. However, identifying suitable sensing probes and measurement schemes can be a classically intractable task, as it requires optimizing over Hilbert spaces of high dimension. In variational quantum sensing, a probe quantum system is generated via a parameterized quantum circuit (PQC), exposed to an unknown physical parameter through a quantum channel, and measured to collect classical data. PQCs and measurements are typically optimized using offline strategies based on frequentist learning criteria. This paper introduces an adaptive protocol that uses Bayesian inference to optimize the sensing policy via the maximization of the active information gain. The proposed variational methodology is tailored for non-asymptotic regimes where a single probe can be deployed in each time step, and is extended to support the fusion of estimates from multiple quantum sensing agents.

Title: Designing for Difference: How Human Characteristics Shape Perceptions of Collaborative Robots
Authors: Sabrina Livanec, Laura Londoño, Michael Gorki, Adrian Röfer, Abhinav Valada, Andrea Kiesel
Abstract: The development of assistive robots for social collaboration raises critical questions about responsible and inclusive design, especially when interacting with individuals from protected groups such as those with disabilities or advanced age. Currently, research is scarce on how participants assess varying robot behaviors in combination with diverse human needs, likely since participants have limited real-world experience with advanced domestic robots. In the current study, we aim to address this gap while using methods that enable participants to assess robot behavior, as well as methods that support meaningful reflection despite limited experience. In an online study, 112 participants (from both experimental and control groups) evaluated 7 videos from a total of 28 variations of human-robot collaboration types. The experimental group first completed a cognitive-affective mapping (CAM) exercise on human-robot collaboration before providing their ratings. Although CAM reflection did not significantly affect overall ratings, it led to more pronounced assessments for certain combinations of robot behavior and human condition. Most importantly, the type of human-robot collaboration influences the assessment. Antisocial robot behavior was consistently rated as the lowest, while collaboration with aged individuals elicited more sensitive evaluations. Scenarios involving object handovers were viewed more positively than those without them. These findings suggest that both human characteristics and interaction paradigms influence the perceived acceptability of collaborative robots, underscoring the importance of prosocial design. They also highlight the potential of reflective methods, such as CAM, to elicit nuanced feedback, supporting the development of user-centered and socially responsible robotic systems tailored to diverse populations.

Title: Guided Reinforcement Learning for Omnidirectional 3D Jumping in Quadruped Robots
Authors: Riccardo Bussola, Michele Focchi, Giulio Turrisi, Claudio Semini, Luigi Palopoli
Abstract: Jumping poses a significant challenge for quadruped robots, despite being crucial for many operational scenarios. While optimisation methods exist for controlling such motions, they are often time-consuming and demand extensive knowledge of robot and terrain parameters, making them less robust in real-world scenarios. Reinforcement learning (RL) is emerging as a viable alternative, yet conventional end-to-end approaches lack efficiency in terms of sample complexity, requiring extensive training in simulations, and predictability of the final motion, which makes it difficult to certify the safety of the final motion. To overcome these limitations, this paper introduces a novel guided reinforcement learning approach that leverages physical intuition for efficient and explainable jumping, by combining Bézier curves with a Uniformly Accelerated Rectilinear Motion (UARM) model. Extensive simulation and experimental results clearly demonstrate the advantages of our approach over existing alternatives.

Title: Spiking neurons as predictive controllers of linear systems
Authors: Paolo Agliati, André Urbano, Pablo Lanillos, Nasir Ahmad, Marcel van Gerven, Sander Keemink
Abstract: Neurons communicate with downstream systems via sparse and incredibly brief electrical pulses, or spikes. Using these events, they control various targets such as neuromuscular units, neurosecretory systems, and other neurons in connected circuits. This gave rise to the idea of spiking neurons as controllers, in which spikes are the control signal. Using instantaneous events directly as the control inputs, also called `impulse control', is challenging as it does not scale well to larger networks and has low analytical tractability. Therefore, current spiking control usually relies on filtering the spike signal to approximate analog control. This ultimately means spiking neural networks (SNNs) have to output a continuous control signal, necessitating continuous energy input into downstream systems. Here, we circumvent the need for rate-based representations, providing a scalable method for task-specific spiking control with sparse neural activity. In doing so, we take inspiration from both optimal control and neuroscience theory, and define a spiking rule where spikes are only emitted if they bring a dynamical system closer to a target. From this principle, we derive the required connectivity for an SNN, and show that it can successfully control linear systems. We show that for physically constrained systems, predictive control is required, and the control signal ends up exploiting the passive dynamics of the downstream system to reach a target. Finally, we show that the control method scales to both high-dimensional networks and systems. Importantly, in all cases, we maintain a closed-form mathematical derivation of the network connectivity, the network dynamics and the control objective. This work advances the understanding of SNNs as biologically-inspired controllers, providing insight into how real neurons could exert control, and enabling applications in neuromorphic hardware design.

Title: Active RISs: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Recep Akif Tasci, Panagiotis Gavriilidis, Ertugrul Basar, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS)-empowered communication has emerged as a transformative technology for next generation wireless networks, enabling the programmable shaping of the propagation environment. However, conventional RISs are fundamentally limited by the double path loss effect, which severely attenuates the reflected signals. To overcome this, active RIS architectures, capable of amplifying impinging signals, have been proposed. This chapter investigates the modeling, performance analysis, and optimization of active RISs, focusing on two hardware designs: a dual-RIS structure with a single Power Amplifier (PA), and a reflection amplification structure at the unit cell level using tunnel diodes. For the PA-based design, a comprehensive mathematical model is developed, and closed-form expressions for the received signal-to-noise ratio, bit error probability, and Energy Efficiency (EE) are derived. An optimization framework for configuring the phase shifts and amplifier gain is proposed to maximize system capacity under power constraints. Regarding the second design, the integration of a tunnel diode into the unit cell is carefully studied by analyzing its I-V characteristic, enabling the derivation of the negative resistance range and the power consumption model. Furthermore, the intrinsic phase-amplitude coupling of the reflection coefficient is characterized through compact linear algebra formulations, enabling practical optimization of active RISs. Extensive numerical simulations validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that active RISs can effectively overcome the double path loss limitation and achieve favorable EE trade-offs compared to passive RISs. Finally, the trade-off between the available power budget and the number of active elements is examined, revealing that a higher number of active elements does not always lead to optimal performance.

Title: Optimization of DNN-based HSI Segmentation FPGA-based SoC for ADS: A Practical Approach
Authors: Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa, Koldo Basterretxea, Javier Echanobe
Abstract: The use of HSI for autonomous navigation is a promising research field aimed at improving the accuracy and robustness of detection, tracking, and scene understanding systems based on vision sensors. Combining advanced computer algorithms, such as DNNs, with small-size snapshot HSI cameras enhances the reliability of these systems. HSI overcomes intrinsic limitations of greyscale and RGB imaging in depicting physical properties of targets, particularly regarding spectral reflectance and metamerism. Despite promising results in HSI-based vision developments, safety-critical systems like ADS demand strict constraints on latency, resource consumption, and security, motivating the shift of ML workloads to edge platforms. This involves a thorough software/hardware co-design scheme to distribute and optimize the tasks efficiently among the limited resources of computing platforms. With respect to inference, the over-parameterized nature of DNNs poses significant computational challenges for real-time on-the-edge deployment. In addition, the intensive data preprocessing required by HSI, which is frequently overlooked, must be carefully managed in terms of memory arrangement and inter-task communication to enable an efficient integrated pipeline design on a SoC. This work presents a set of optimization techniques for the practical co-design of a DNN-based HSI segmentation processor deployed on a FPGA-based SoC targeted at ADS, including key optimizations such as functional software/hardware task distribution, hardware-aware preprocessing, ML model compression, and a complete pipelined deployment. Applied compression techniques significantly reduce the complexity of the designed DNN to 24.34% of the original operations and to 1.02% of the original number of parameters, achieving a 2.86x speed-up in the inference task without noticeable degradation of the segmentation accuracy.

Title: TTMBA: Towards Text To Multiple Sources Binaural Audio Generation
Authors: Yuxuan He, Xiaoran Yang, Ningning Pan, Gongping Huang
Abstract: Most existing text-to-audio (TTA) generation methods produce mono outputs, neglecting essential spatial information for immersive auditory experiences. To address this issue, we propose a cascaded method for text-to-multisource binaural audio generation (TTMBA) with both temporal and spatial control. First, a pretrained large language model (LLM) segments the text into a structured format with time and spatial details for each sound event. Next, a pretrained mono audio generation network creates multiple mono audios with varying durations for each event. These mono audios are transformed into binaural audios using a binaural rendering neural network based on spatial data from the LLM. Finally, the binaural audios are arranged by their start times, resulting in multisource binaural audio. Experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method in terms of both audio generation quality and spatial perceptual accuracy.

Abstract: This paper presents Step-Audio~2, an end-to-end multi-modal large language model designed for industry-strength audio understanding and speech conversation. By integrating a latent audio encoder and reasoning-centric reinforcement learning (RL), Step-Audio 2 achieves promising performance in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and audio understanding. To facilitate genuine end-to-end speech conversation, Step-Audio 2 incorporates the generation of discrete audio tokens into language modeling, significantly enhancing its responsiveness to paralinguistic information such as speaking styles and emotions. To effectively leverage the rich textual and acoustic knowledge in real-world data, Step-Audio 2 integrates retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) and is able to call external tools such as web search to mitigate hallucination and audio search to switch timbres. Trained on millions of hours of speech and audio data, Step-Audio 2 delivers intelligence and expressiveness across diverse conversational scenarios. Evaluation results demonstrate that Step-Audio 2 achieves state-of-the-art performance on various audio understanding and conversational benchmarks compared to other open-source and commercial solutions.

Title: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface-Enabled Green and Secure Offloading for Mobile Edge Computing Networks
Authors: Tong-Xing Zheng, Xinji Wang, Xin Chen, Di Mao, Jia Shi, Cunhua Pan, Chongwen Huang, Haiyang Ding, Zan Li
Abstract: This paper investigates a multi-user uplink mobile edge computing (MEC) network, where the users offload partial tasks securely to an access point under the non-orthogonal multiple access policy with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) against a multi-antenna eavesdropper. We formulate a non-convex optimization problem of minimizing the total energy consumption subject to secure offloading requirement, and we build an efficient block coordinate descent framework to iteratively optimize the number of local computation bits and transmit power at the users, the RIS phase shifts, and the multi-user detection matrix at the access point. Specifically, we successively adopt successive convex approximation, semi-definite programming, and semidefinite relaxation to solve the problem with perfect eavesdropper's channel state information (CSI), and we then employ S-procedure and penalty convex-concave to achieve robust design for the imperfect CSI case. We provide extensive numerical results to validate the convergence and effectiveness of the proposed algorithms. We demonstrate that RIS plays a significant role in realizing a secure and energy-efficient MEC network, and deploying a well-designed RIS can save energy consumption by up to 60\% compared to that without RIS. We further reveal impacts of various key factors on the secrecy energy efficiency, including RIS element number and deployment position, user number, task scale and duration, and CSI imperfection.

Title: SALM: Spatial Audio Language Model with Structured Embeddings for Understanding and Editing
Authors: Jinbo Hu, Yin Cao, Ming Wu, Feiran Yang, Jun Yang
Abstract: Spatial audio understanding is essential for accurately perceiving and interpreting acoustic environments. However, existing audio-language models struggle with processing spatial audio and perceiving spatial acoustic scenes. We introduce the Spatial Audio Language Model (SALM), a novel framework that bridges spatial audio and language via multi-modal contrastive learning. SALM consists of a text encoder and a dual-branch audio encoder, decomposing spatial sound into semantic and spatial components through structured audio embeddings. Key features of SALM include seamless alignment of spatial and text representations, separate and joint extraction of spatial and semantic information, zero-shot direction classification and robust support for spatial audio editing. Experimental results demonstrate that SALM effectively captures and aligns cross-modal representations. Furthermore, it supports advanced editing capabilities, such as altering directional audio using text-based embeddings.

Title: Multi-RIS-Empowered Communication Systems: Capacity Analysis and Optimization
Authors: Aris L. Moustakas, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: In this chapter, using statistical physics methods, asymptotic closed-form expressions for the mean and variance of the mutual information for a multi-antenna transmitter-receiver pair in the presence of multiple Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) are presented. While nominally valid in the large-system limit, it is shown that the derived Gaussian approximation for the mutual information can be quite accurate, even for modest-sized antenna arrays and metasurfaces. The above results are particularly useful when fast-fading conditions are present, which renders channel estimation challenging. The derived analysis indicates that, when the channel close to an RIS is correlated, for instance due to small angle spread which is reasonable for wireless systems with increasing carrier frequencies, the communication link benefits significantly from statistical RIS optimization, resulting in gains that are surprisingly higher than the nearly uncorrelated case. More importantly, the presented novel asymptotic properties of the correlation matrices of the impinging and outgoing signals at the RISs can be deployed to optimize the metasurfaces without brute-force numerical optimization. The numerical investigation demonstrates that, when the desired reflection from any of the RISs departs significantly from geometrical optics, the metasurfaces can be optimized to provide robust communication links, without significant need for their optimal placement.

Title: Now and Future of Artificial Intelligence-based Signet Ring Cell Diagnosis: A Survey
Authors: Zhu Meng, Junhao Dong, Limei Guo, Fei Su, Jiaxuan Liu, Guangxi Wang, Zhicheng Zhao
Abstract: Signet ring cells (SRCs), associated with a high propensity for peripheral metastasis and poor prognosis, critically influence surgical decision-making and outcome prediction. However, their detection remains challenging even for experienced pathologists. While artificial intelligence (AI)-based automated SRC diagnosis has gained increasing attention for its potential to enhance diagnostic efficiency and accuracy, existing methodologies lack systematic review. This gap impedes the assessment of disparities between algorithmic capabilities and clinical applicability. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of AI-driven SRC analysis from 2008 through June 2025. We systematically summarize the biological characteristics of SRCs and challenges in their automated identification. Representative algorithms are analyzed and categorized as unimodal or multi-modal approaches. Unimodal algorithms, encompassing image, omics, and text data, are reviewed; image-based ones are further subdivided into classification, detection, segmentation, and foundation model tasks. Multi-modal algorithms integrate two or more data modalities (images, omics, and text). Finally, by evaluating current methodological performance against clinical assistance requirements, we discuss unresolved challenges and future research directions in SRC analysis. This survey aims to assist researchers, particularly those without medical backgrounds, in understanding the landscape of SRC analysis and the prospects for intelligent diagnosis, thereby accelerating the translation of computational algorithms into clinical practice.

Title: FLLIC: Functionally Lossless Image Compression
Authors: Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu
Abstract: Recently, DNN models for lossless image coding have surpassed their traditional counterparts in compression performance, reducing the previous lossless bit rate by about ten percent for natural color images. But even with these advances, mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To overcome the performance barrier of MLLIC, we question the very necessity of MLLIC. Considering that all digital imaging sensors suffer from acquisition noises, why should we insist on mathematically lossless coding, i.e., wasting bits to preserve noises? Instead, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint denoising and compression of noisy images and does so at a lower computational cost.

Title: Recurrent Inference Machine for Medical Image Registration
Authors: Yi Zhang, Yidong Zhao, Hui Xue, Peter Kellman, Stefan Klein, Qian Tao
Abstract: Image registration is essential for medical image applications where alignment of voxels across multiple images is needed for qualitative or quantitative analysis. With recent advancements in deep neural networks and parallel computing, deep learning-based medical image registration methods become competitive with their flexible modelling and fast inference capabilities. However, compared to traditional optimization-based registration methods, the speed advantage may come at the cost of registration performance at inference time. Besides, deep neural networks ideally demand large training datasets while optimization-based methods are training-free. To improve registration accuracy and data efficiency, we propose a novel image registration method, termed Recurrent Inference Image Registration (RIIR) network. RIIR is formulated as a meta-learning solver to the registration problem in an iterative manner. RIIR addresses the accuracy and data efficiency issues, by learning the update rule of optimization, with implicit regularization combined with explicit gradient input. We evaluated RIIR extensively on brain MRI and quantitative cardiac MRI datasets, in terms of both registration accuracy and training data efficiency. Our experiments showed that RIIR outperformed a range of deep learning-based methods, even with only $5\%$ of the training data, demonstrating high data efficiency. Key findings from our ablation studies highlighted the important added value of the hidden states introduced in the recurrent inference framework for meta-learning. Our proposed RIIR offers a highly data-efficient framework for deep learning-based medical image registration.

Title: Investigation of unsupervised and supervised hyperspectral anomaly detection
Authors: Mazharul Hossain, Aaron Robinson, Lan Wang, Chrysanthe Preza
Abstract: Hyperspectral sensing is a valuable tool for detecting anomalies and distinguishing between materials in a scene. Hyperspectral anomaly detection (HS-AD) helps characterize the captured scenes and separates them into anomaly and background classes. It is vital in agriculture, environment, and military applications such as RSTA (reconnaissance, surveillance, and target acquisition) missions. We previously designed an equal voting ensemble of hyperspectral unmixing and three unsupervised HS-AD algorithms. We later utilized a supervised classifier to determine the weights of a voting ensemble, creating a hybrid of heterogeneous unsupervised HS-AD algorithms with a supervised classifier in a model stacking, which improved detection accuracy. However, supervised classification methods usually fail to detect novel or unknown patterns that substantially deviate from those seen previously. In this work, we evaluate our technique and other supervised and unsupervised methods using general hyperspectral data to provide new insights.

Title: Node Reliability: Approximation, Upper Bounds, and Applications to Network Robustness
Authors: Xinhan Liu, Robert Kooij, Piet Van Mieghem
Abstract: This paper discusses the reliability of a graph in which the links are perfectly reliable but the nodes may fail with certain probability p. Calculating graph node reliability is an NP-Hard problem. We introduce an efficient and accurate Monte Carlo method and a stochastic approximation for the node reliability polynomial based solely on the degree distribution. We provide the formulas for the node reliability polynomial of both Erdos-Renyi graphs and Random Geometric graphs. The phase transition in the node reliability of Erdos-Renyi graphs is also discussed. Additionally, we propose two increasingly accurate upper bounds for the node reliability polynomial solely based on the graph's degree distributions. The advantages and disadvantages of these two upper bounds are thoroughly compared. Beyond the computation of node reliability polynomials, we also estimate the number of cut sets and present a solution to the reliability-based network enhancement problem.

Title: Integrating and Comparing Radiality Constraints for Optimized Distribution System Reconfiguration
Authors: Pablo Cortes, Alejandra Tabares, Fredy Franco
Abstract: The reconfiguration of electrical power distribution systems is a crucial optimization problem aimed at minimizing power losses by altering the system topology through the operation of interconnection switches. This problem, typically modelled as a mixed integer nonlinear program demands high computational resources for large scale networks and requires specialized radiality constraints for maintaining the tree like structure of distribution networks. This paper presents a comprehensive analysis that integrates and compares the computational burden associated with different radiality constraint formulations proposed in the specialized literature for the reconfiguration of distribution systems. By using consistent hardware and software setups, we evaluate the performance of these constraints across several well known test cases. Our findings reveal significant differences in computational efficiency depending on the chosen set of radiality constraints, providing valuable insights for optimizing reconfiguration strategies in practical distribution networks.

Title: AsyMov: Integrated Sensing and Communications with Asynchronous Moving Devices
Authors: Gianmaria Ventura, Michele Rossi, Jacopo Pegoraro
Abstract: Estimating the Doppler frequency shift caused by moving targets is one of the key objectives of Integrated Sensing And Communication (ISAC) systems, as it enables applications such as target classification, human activity recognition, and gait analysis. In practical scenarios, Doppler estimation is hindered by the movement of transmitter and receiver devices, and by the phase offsets caused by their clock asynchrony. Existing approaches have separately addressed these two aspects, either assuming clock-synchronous moving devices or asynchronous static ones. In fact, jointly tackling device motion and clock asynchrony is extremely challenging, as the Doppler shift from device movement differs for each propagation path and the phase offsets are time-varying. In this work, we present AsyMov, a method to estimate the bistatic Doppler frequency of a target and its velocity in ISAC setups featuring mobile and asynchronous devices. It leverages the channel impulse response at the receiver, by originally exploiting the invariance of phase offsets across propagation paths and the bistatic geometry, where the target Doppler and the device velocity are jointly estimated by a newly proposed alternating minimization algorithm. Moreover, it can be seamlessly integrated with device velocity measurements obtained from onboard sensors (if available), for enhanced reliability. Here, AsyMov is thoroughly characterized by way of theory (Cramér-Rao bound), simulation and experiments, implementing it on an IEEE 802.11ay testbed and testing it on multiple setups, also including a moving human target. Numerical and experimental results show superior performance against state-of-the-art methods and are on par with scenarios featuring static ISAC devices.

Title: Hybrid Near-field and Far-field Localization with Holographic MIMO
Authors: Mengyuan Cao, Haobo Zhang, Yonina C. Eldar, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: Due to its ability to precisely control wireless beams, holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) is expected to be a promising solution to achieve high-accuracy localization. However, as the scale of HMIMO increases to improve beam control capability, the corresponding near-field (NF) region expands, indicating that users may exist in both NF and far-field (FF) regions with different electromagnetic transmission characteristics. As a result, existing methods for pure NF or FF localization are no longer applicable. We consider a hybrid NF and FF localization scenario in this paper, where a base station (BS) locates multiple users in both NF and FF regions with the aid of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS), which is a low-cost implementation of HMIMO. In such a scenario, it is difficult to locate the users and optimize the RIS phase shifts because whether the location of the user is in the NF or FF region is unknown, and the channels of different users are coupled. To tackle this challenge, we propose a RIS-enabled localization method that searches the users in both NF and FF regions and tackles the coupling issue by jointly estimating all user locations. We derive the localization error bound by considering the channel coupling and propose an RIS phase shift optimization algorithm that minimizes the derived bound. Simulations show the effectiveness of the proposed method and demonstrate the performance gain compared to pure NF and FF techniques.

Title: Hybrid Near-Field and Far-Field Localization with Multiple Holographic MIMO Surfaces
Authors: Weiqiao Zhu, Mengyuan Cao, Yang Yang, Haobo Zhang, Weijun Hao, Xiaofei Jia, Hongliang Zhang
Abstract: Localization using multiple base stations (BSs) has gained much attention for its advantage in localization accuracy. However, the performance of the multi-BS system suffers from its limited number of antennas. To solve the above issue, we propose to use reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) serving as antennas. Existing localization methods enabled by multiple RISs mainly focus on the far-field (FF) region of each RIS. As the scale of RIS increases, the near-field (NF) region of each RIS expands, where FF methods struggle to achieve high localization accuracy. In this letter, a hybrid NF and FF localization method aided by multiple RISs is proposed. In such scenarios, achieving user localization and RIS optimization becomes challenging due to the high complexity caused by the exhaustive search through all candidate locations to match the signals. Moreover, the interference from multiple RISs degrades the localization accuracy. To address this challenge, we propose a two-phase localization method that first estimates the relative locations of the user to each RIS and fuses the results to obtain the estimation. This approach reduces the complexity by decreasing the number of candidate locations considered in each step. Also, we introduce a constraint in the RIS optimization problem that limits the sidelobe levels directed towards other RISs, effectively minimizing inter-RIS interference. The effectiveness of the proposed method is verified through simulations.

Title: Retrieving Filter Spectra in CNN for Explainable Sleep Stage Classification
Authors: Stephan Goerttler, Yucheng Wang, Fei He, Min Wu
Abstract: Despite significant advances in deep learning-based sleep stage classification, the clinical adoption of automatic classification models remains slow. One key challenge is the lack of explainability, as many models function as black boxes with millions of parameters. In response, recent work has increasingly focussed on enhancing model explainability. This study contributes to these efforts by globally explaining spectral processing of individual EEG channels. Specifically, we introduce a method to retrieve the filter spectrum of low-level convolutional feature extraction and compare it with the classification-relevant spectral information in the data. We evaluate our approach on the EEGNet and MSA-CNN models using the ISRUC-S3 and Sleep-EDF-20 datasets. Our findings show that spectral processing plays a significant role in the lower frequency bands. In addition, comparing the correlation between filter spectrum and data-derived spectral information with univariate performance indicates that the model naturally prioritises the most informative channels in a multimodal setting. We specify how these insights can be leveraged to enhance model performance. The code for the filter spectrum retrieval and its analysis is available at this https URL.

Title: Online Learning of Nonlinear Parametric Models under Non-smooth Regularization using EKF and ADMM
Authors: Lapo Frascati, Alberto Bemporad
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel combination of extended Kalman filtering (EKF) with the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) for learning parametric nonlinear models online under non-smooth regularization terms, including l1 and l0 penalties and bound constraints on model parameters. For the case of linear time-varying models and non-smoothconvex regularization terms, we provide a sublinear regret bound that ensures the proper behavior of the online learning strategy. The approach is computationally efficient for a wide range of regularization terms, which makes it appealing for its use in embedded control applications for online model adaptation. We show the performance of the proposed method in three simulation examples, highlighting its effectiveness compared to other batch and online algorithms.

Title: Graph Neural Network-Based Distributed Optimal Control for Linear Networked Systems: An Online Distributed Training Approach
Authors: Zihao Song, Shirantha Welikala, Panos J. Antsaklis, Hai Lin
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the distributed optimal control problem for discrete-time linear networked systems. In particular, we are interested in learning distributed optimal controllers using graph recurrent neural networks (GRNNs). Most of the existing approaches result in centralized optimal controllers with offline training processes. However, as the increasing demand of network resilience, the optimal controllers are further expected to be distributed, and are desirable to be trained in an online distributed fashion, which are also the main contributions of our work. To solve this problem, we first propose a GRNN-based distributed optimal control method, and we cast the problem as a self-supervised learning problem. Then, the distributed online training is achieved via distributed gradient computation, and inspired by the (consensus-based) distributed optimization idea, a distributed online training optimizer is designed. Furthermore, the local closed-loop stability of the linear networked system under our proposed GRNN-based controller is provided by assuming that the nonlinear activation function of the GRNN-based controller is both local sector-bounded and slope-restricted. The effectiveness of our proposed method is illustrated by numerical simulations using a specifically developed simulator.

Title: ISDrama: Immersive Spatial Drama Generation through Multimodal Prompting
Authors: Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Zhiyuan Zhu, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Multimodal immersive spatial drama generation focuses on creating continuous multi-speaker binaural speech with dramatic prosody based on multimodal prompts, with potential applications in AR, VR, and others. This task requires simultaneous modeling of spatial information and dramatic prosody based on multimodal inputs, with high data collection costs. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first attempt to address these challenges. We construct MRSDrama, the first multimodal recorded spatial drama dataset, containing binaural drama audios, scripts, videos, geometric poses, and textual prompts. Then, we propose ISDrama, the first immersive spatial drama generation model through multimodal prompting. ISDrama comprises these primary components: 1) Multimodal Pose Encoder, based on contrastive learning, considering the Doppler effect caused by moving speakers to extract unified pose information from multimodal prompts. 2) Immersive Drama Transformer, a flow-based mamba-transformer model that generates high-quality drama, incorporating Drama-MOE to select proper experts for enhanced prosody and pose control. We also design a context-consistent classifier-free guidance strategy to coherently generate complete drama. Experimental results show that ISDrama outperforms baseline models on objective and subjective metrics. The demos are available at this https URL. We provide the dataset and the evaluation code at this https URL and this https URL.

Title: MDDM: A Multi-view Discriminative Enhanced Diffusion-based Model for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Nan Xu, Zhaolong Huang, Xiaonan Zhi
Abstract: With the development of deep learning, speech enhancement has been greatly optimized in terms of speech quality. Previous methods typically focus on the discriminative supervised learning or generative modeling, which tends to introduce speech distortions or high computational cost. In this paper, we propose MDDM, a Multi-view Discriminative enhanced Diffusion-based Model. Specifically, we take the features of three domains (time, frequency and noise) as inputs of a discriminative prediction network, generating the preliminary spectrogram. Then, the discriminative output can be converted to clean speech by several inference sampling steps. Due to the intersection of the distributions between discriminative output and clean target, the smaller sampling steps can achieve the competitive performance compared to other diffusion-based methods. Experiments conducted on a public dataset and a realworld dataset validate the effectiveness of MDDM, either on subjective or objective metric.

Title: Towards provable probabilistic safety for scalable embodied AI systems
Authors: Linxuan He, Qing-Shan Jia, Ang Li, Hongyan Sang, Ling Wang, Jiwen Lu, Tao Zhang, Jie Zhou, Yi Zhang, Yisen Wang, Peng Wei, Zhongyuan Wang, Henry X. Liu, Shuo Feng
Abstract: Embodied AI systems, comprising AI models and physical plants, are increasingly prevalent across various applications. Due to the rarity of system failures, ensuring their safety in complex operating environments remains a major challenge, which severely hinders their large-scale deployment in safety-critical domains, such as autonomous vehicles, medical devices, and robotics. While achieving provable deterministic safety--verifying system safety across all possible scenarios--remains theoretically ideal, the rarity and complexity of corner cases make this approach impractical for scalable embodied AI systems. Instead, empirical safety evaluation is employed as an alternative, but the absence of provable guarantees imposes significant limitations. To address these issues, we argue for a paradigm shift to provable probabilistic safety that integrates provable guarantees with progressive achievement toward a probabilistic safety boundary on overall system performance. The new paradigm better leverages statistical methods to enhance feasibility and scalability, and a well-defined probabilistic safety boundary enables embodied AI systems to be deployed at scale. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for provable probabilistic safety, along with corresponding challenges and potential solutions. By bridging the gap between theoretical safety assurance and practical deployment, this Perspective offers a pathway toward safer, large-scale adoption of embodied AI systems in safety-critical applications.

Title: Diffusion-Based Electrocardiography Noise Quantification via Anomaly Detection
Authors: Tae-Seong Han, Jae-Wook Heo, Hakseung Kim, Cheol-Hui Lee, Hyub Huh, Eue-Keun Choi, Hye Jin Kim, Dong-Joo Kim
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) signals are frequently degraded by noise, limiting their clinical reliability in both conventional and wearable settings. Existing methods for addressing ECG noise, relying on artifact classification or denoising, are constrained by annotation inconsistencies and poor generalizability. Here, we address these limitations by reframing ECG noise quantification as an anomaly detection task. We propose a diffusion-based framework trained to model the normative distribution of clean ECG signals, identifying deviations as noise without requiring explicit artifact labels. To robustly evaluate performance and mitigate label inconsistencies, we introduce a distribution-based metric using the Wasserstein-1 distance ($W_1$). Our model achieved a macro-average $W_1$ score of 1.308, outperforming the next-best method by over 48\%. External validation confirmed strong generalizability, facilitating the exclusion of noisy segments to improve diagnostic accuracy and support timely clinical intervention. This approach enhances real-time ECG monitoring and broadens ECG applicability in digital health technologies.

Title: GenControl: Generative AI-Driven Autonomous Design of Control Algorithms
Authors: Chenggang Cui, Jiaming Liu, Peifeng Hui, Pengfeng Lin, Chuanlin Zhang
Abstract: Designing controllers for complex industrial electronic systems is challenging due to nonlinearities and parameter uncertainties, and traditional methods are often slow and costly. To address this, we propose a novel autonomous design framework driven by Large Language Models (LLMs). Our approach employs a bi-level optimization strategy: an LLM intelligently explores and iteratively improves the control algorithm's structure, while a Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm efficiently refines the parameters for any given structure. This method achieves end-to-end automated design. Validated through a simulation of a DC-DC Boost converter, our framework successfully evolved a basic controller into a high-performance adaptive version that met all stringent design specifications for fast response, low error, and robustness. This work presents a new paradigm for control design that significantly enhances automation and efficiency.

Title: Attention-Based Fusion of IQ and FFT Spectrograms with AoA Features for GNSS Jammer Localization
Authors: Lucas Heublein, Christian Wielenberg, Thorsten Nowak, Tobias Feigl, Christopher Mutschler, Felix Ott
Abstract: Jamming devices disrupt signals from the global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and pose a significant threat by compromising the reliability of accurate positioning. Consequently, the detection and localization of these interference signals are essential to achieve situational awareness, mitigating their impact, and implementing effective counter-measures. Classical Angle of Arrival (AoA) methods exhibit reduced accuracy in multipath environments due to signal reflections and scattering, leading to localization errors. Additionally, AoA-based techniques demand substantial computational resources for array signal processing. In this paper, we propose a novel approach for detecting and classifying interference while estimating the distance, azimuth, and elevation of jamming sources. Our benchmark study evaluates 128 vision encoder and time-series models to identify the highest-performing methods for each task. We introduce an attention-based fusion framework that integrates in-phase and quadrature (IQ) samples with Fast Fourier Transform (FFT)-computed spectrograms while incorporating 22 AoA features to enhance localization accuracy. Furthermore, we present a novel dataset of moving jamming devices recorded in an indoor environment with dynamic multipath conditions and demonstrate superior performance compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: NeuroHD-RA: Neural-distilled Hyperdimensional Model with Rhythm Alignment
Authors: ZhengXiao He, Jinghao Wen, Huayu Li, Ao Li
Abstract: We present a novel and interpretable framework for electrocardiogram (ECG)-based disease detection that combines hyperdimensional computing (HDC) with learnable neural encoding. Unlike conventional HDC approaches that rely on static, random projections, our method introduces a rhythm-aware and trainable encoding pipeline based on RR intervals, a physiological signal segmentation strategy that aligns with cardiac cycles. The core of our design is a neural-distilled HDC architecture, featuring a learnable RR-block encoder and a BinaryLinear hyperdimensional projection layer, optimized jointly with cross-entropy and proxy-based metric loss. This hybrid framework preserves the symbolic interpretability of HDC while enabling task-adaptive representation learning. Experiments on Apnea-ECG and PTB-XL demonstrate that our model significantly outperforms traditional HDC and classical ML baselines, achieving 73.09\% precision and an F1 score of 0.626 on Apnea-ECG, with comparable robustness on PTB-XL. Our framework offers an efficient and scalable solution for edge-compatible ECG classification, with strong potential for interpretable and personalized health monitoring.

Title: How Many Simultaneous Beamformers are Needed for Integrated Sensing and Communications?
Authors: Kareem M. Attiah, Wei Yu
Abstract: Consider a downlink integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) system in which a base station employs linear beamforming to communicate to $K$ users, while simultaneously uses sensing beams to perform a sensing task of estimating $L$ real parameters. How many beamformers are needed to achieve the best performance for both sensing and communications? This paper establishes bounds on the minimum number of downlink beamformers, in which sensing performance is measured in terms of the Cramér-Rao bound for parameter estimation and communications performance is measured in terms of the signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios. We show that an ISAC system requires at most $K + \sqrt{\frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$ beamformers if the remote users have the ability to cancel the interference caused by the sensing beams. If cancelling interference due to the sensing beams is not possible, the bound becomes $\sqrt{K^2 + \frac{L(L+1)}{2}}$. Interestingly, in the latter case, the bound on the number of beamformers is less than the sum of the bounds for each task individually. These results can be extended to sensing tasks for which the performance is measured as a function of $d$ quadratic terms in the beamformers. In this case, the bound becomes $K + \sqrt{d}$ and $\sqrt{K^2 + d}$, respectively. Specifically, for estimating complex path losses and angles-of-arrival of $N_\text{tr}$ targets while communicating to $K$ users, the bound on the minimum number of beamformers scales linearly in $K$ and in $N_\text{tr}$, assuming interference from sensing can be cancelled. When interference cancellation is not possible, the following exact characterization for the case of $N_\text{tr} = 1$ can be obtained: when $K=0$ or $1$, two beamformers should be used; when $K \ge 2$, exactly $K$ beamformers should be used, i.e., communication beamformers alone are already sufficient.

Title: EndoControlMag: Robust Endoscopic Vascular Motion Magnification with Periodic Reference Resetting and Hierarchical Tissue-aware Dual-Mask Contro
Authors: An Wanga, Rulin Zhou, Mengya Xu, Yiru Ye, Longfei Gou, Yiting Chang, Hao Chen, Chwee Ming Lim, Jiankun Wang, Hongliang Ren
Abstract: Visualizing subtle vascular motions in endoscopic surgery is crucial for surgical precision and decision-making, yet remains challenging due to the complex and dynamic nature of surgical scenes. To address this, we introduce EndoControlMag, a training-free, Lagrangian-based framework with mask-conditioned vascular motion magnification tailored to endoscopic environments. Our approach features two key modules: a Periodic Reference Resetting (PRR) scheme that divides videos into short overlapping clips with dynamically updated reference frames to prevent error accumulation while maintaining temporal coherence, and a Hierarchical Tissue-aware Magnification (HTM) framework with dual-mode mask dilation. HTM first tracks vessel cores using a pretrained visual tracking model to maintain accurate localization despite occlusions and view changes. It then applies one of two adaptive softening strategies to surrounding tissues: motion-based softening that modulates magnification strength proportional to observed tissue displacement, or distance-based exponential decay that simulates biomechanical force attenuation. This dual-mode approach accommodates diverse surgical scenarios-motion-based softening excels with complex tissue deformations while distance-based softening provides stability during unreliable optical flow conditions. We evaluate EndoControlMag on our EndoVMM24 dataset spanning four different surgery types and various challenging scenarios, including occlusions, instrument disturbance, view changes, and vessel deformations. Quantitative metrics, visual assessments, and expert surgeon evaluations demonstrate that EndoControlMag significantly outperforms existing methods in both magnification accuracy and visual quality while maintaining robustness across challenging surgical conditions.

Title: DeSamba: Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Framework for 3D Multi-Sequence MRI Lesion Classification
Authors: Dezhen Wang, Sheng Miao, Rongxin Chai, Jiufa Cui
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) sequences provide rich spatial and frequency domain information, which is crucial for accurate lesion classification in medical imaging. However, effectively integrating multi-sequence MRI data for robust 3D lesion classification remains a challenge. In this paper, we propose DeSamba (Decoupled Spectral Adaptive Network and Mamba-Based Model), a novel framework designed to extract decoupled representations and adaptively fuse spatial and spectral features for lesion classification. DeSamba introduces a Decoupled Representation Learning Module (DRLM) that decouples features from different MRI sequences through self-reconstruction and cross-reconstruction, and a Spectral Adaptive Modulation Block (SAMB) within the proposed SAMNet, enabling dynamic fusion of spectral and spatial information based on lesion characteristics. We evaluate DeSamba on two clinically relevant 3D datasets. On a six-class spinal metastasis dataset (n=1,448), DeSamba achieves 62.10% Top-1 accuracy, 63.62% F1-score, 87.71% AUC, and 93.55% Top-3 accuracy on an external validation set (n=372), outperforming all state-of-the-art (SOTA) baselines. On a spondylitis dataset (n=251) involving a challenging binary classification task, DeSamba achieves 70.00%/64.52% accuracy and 74.75/73.88 AUC on internal and external validation sets, respectively. Ablation studies demonstrate that both DRLM and SAMB significantly contribute to overall performance, with over 10% relative improvement compared to the baseline. Our results highlight the potential of DeSamba as a generalizable and effective solution for 3D lesion classification in multi-sequence medical imaging.

Title: miMamba: EEG-based Emotion Recognition with Multi-scale Inverted Mamba Models
Authors: Xin Zhou, Dawei Huang, Xiaojing Peng, Lijun Yin
Abstract: EEG-based emotion recognition holds significant potential in the field of brain-computer interfaces. A key challenge lies in extracting discriminative spatiotemporal features from electroencephalogram (EEG) signals. Existing studies often rely on domain-specific time-frequency features and analyze temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics separately, neglecting the interaction between local-global relationships and spatiotemporal dynamics. To address this, we propose a novel network called Multi-Scale Inverted Mamba (MS-iMamba), which consists of Multi-Scale Temporal Blocks (MSTB) and Temporal-Spatial Fusion Blocks (TSFB). Specifically, MSTBs are designed to capture both local details and global temporal dependencies across different scale subsequences. The TSFBs, implemented with an inverted Mamba structure, focus on the interaction between dynamic temporal dependencies and spatial characteristics. The primary advantage of MS-iMamba lies in its ability to leverage reconstructed multi-scale EEG sequences, exploiting the interaction between temporal and spatial features without the need for domain-specific time-frequency feature extraction. Experimental results on the DEAP, DREAMER, and SEED datasets demonstrate that MS-iMamba achieves classification accuracies of 94.86%, 94.94%, and 91.36%, respectively, using only four-channel EEG signals, outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Title: DisCoPatch: Taming Adversarially-driven Batch Statistics for Improved Out-of-Distribution Detection
Authors: Francisco Caetano, Christiaan Viviers, Luis A. Zavala-Mondragón, Peter H. N. de With, Fons van der Sommen
Abstract: Out-of-distribution (OOD) detection holds significant importance across many applications. While semantic and domain-shift OOD problems are well-studied, this work focuses on covariate shifts - subtle variations in the data distribution that can degrade machine learning performance. We hypothesize that detecting these subtle shifts can improve our understanding of in-distribution boundaries, ultimately improving OOD detection. In adversarial discriminators trained with Batch Normalization (BN), real and adversarial samples form distinct domains with unique batch statistics - a property we exploit for OOD detection. We introduce DisCoPatch, an unsupervised Adversarial Variational Autoencoder (VAE) framework that harnesses this mechanism. During inference, batches consist of patches from the same image, ensuring a consistent data distribution that allows the model to rely on batch statistics. DisCoPatch uses the VAE's suboptimal outputs (generated and reconstructed) as negative samples to train the discriminator, thereby improving its ability to delineate the boundary between in-distribution samples and covariate shifts. By tightening this boundary, DisCoPatch achieves state-of-the-art results in public OOD detection benchmarks. The proposed model not only excels in detecting covariate shifts, achieving 95.5% AUROC on ImageNet-1K(-C) but also outperforms all prior methods on public Near-OOD (95.0%) benchmarks. With a compact model size of 25MB, it achieves high OOD detection performance at notably lower latency than existing methods, making it an efficient and practical solution for real-world OOD detection applications. The code is publicly available.

Title: One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects in Egocentric Organizing Scenes
Authors: Wanjun Jia, Fan Yang, Mengfei Duan, Xianchi Chen, Yinxi Wang, Yiming Jiang, Wenrui Chen, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li
Abstract: Deformable object manipulation in robotics presents significant challenges due to uncertainties in component properties, diverse configurations, visual interference, and ambiguous prompts. These factors complicate both perception and control tasks. To address these challenges, we propose a novel method for One-Shot Affordance Grounding of Deformable Objects (OS-AGDO) in egocentric organizing scenes, enabling robots to recognize previously unseen deformable objects with varying colors and shapes using minimal samples. Specifically, we first introduce the Deformable Object Semantic Enhancement Module (DefoSEM), which enhances hierarchical understanding of the internal structure and improves the ability to accurately identify local features, even under conditions of weak component information. Next, we propose the ORB-Enhanced Keypoint Fusion Module (OEKFM), which optimizes feature extraction of key components by leveraging geometric constraints and improves adaptability to diversity and visual interference. Additionally, we propose an instance-conditional prompt based on image data and task context, which effectively mitigates the issue of region ambiguity caused by prompt words. To validate these methods, we construct a diverse real-world dataset, AGDDO15, which includes 15 common types of deformable objects and their associated organizational actions. Experimental results demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving improvements of 6.2%, 3.2%, and 2.9% in KLD, SIM, and NSS metrics, respectively, while exhibiting high generalization performance.

Title: Unveiling the Potential of Segment Anything Model 2 for RGB-Thermal Semantic Segmentation with Language Guidance
Authors: Jiayi Zhao, Fei Teng, Kai Luo, Guoqiang Zhao, Zhiyong Li, Xu Zheng, Kailun Yang
Abstract: The perception capability of robotic systems relies on the richness of the dataset. Although Segment Anything Model 2 (SAM2), trained on large datasets, demonstrates strong perception potential in perception tasks, its inherent training paradigm prevents it from being suitable for RGB-T tasks. To address these challenges, we propose SHIFNet, a novel SAM2-driven Hybrid Interaction Paradigm that unlocks the potential of SAM2 with linguistic guidance for efficient RGB-Thermal perception. Our framework consists of two key components: (1) Semantic-Aware Cross-modal Fusion (SACF) module that dynamically balances modality contributions through text-guided affinity learning, overcoming SAM2's inherent RGB bias; (2) Heterogeneous Prompting Decoder (HPD) that enhances global semantic information through a semantic enhancement module and then combined with category embeddings to amplify cross-modal semantic consistency. With 32.27M trainable parameters, SHIFNet achieves state-of-the-art segmentation performance on public benchmarks, reaching 89.8% on PST900 and 67.8% on FMB, respectively. The framework facilitates the adaptation of pre-trained large models to RGB-T segmentation tasks, effectively mitigating the high costs associated with data collection while endowing robotic systems with comprehensive perception capabilities.

Title: Wide-Angle, Multiplexed Backscatter Communications Using a Dynamic Metasurface-Backed Luneburg Lens
Authors: Samuel Kim, Tim Sleasman, Avrami Rakovsky, Ra'id Awadallah, David B. Shrekenhamer
Abstract: Backscatter communications is attractive for its low power requirements due to the lack of actively radiating components; however, commonly used devices are typically limited in range and functionality. Here, we design and demonstrate a backscatter device consisting of a flattened Luneburg lens combined with a spatially-tunable dynamic metasurface. Using quasi-conformal transformation optics (QCTO), we design a flattened, additively manufactured Luneburg lens that focuses incoming waves over a wide field-of-view onto its flattened focal plane. When a reflective surface is placed at the focal plane, the flattened Luneburg lens retroreflects, enabling long-range backscatter communications over an extremely large field-of-view ($\pm30\degree$) and bandwidth. The dynamic metasurface is designed to modulated the reflected phase across the S-band (2-4 GHz) with fine spatial control. Thus, when combined with the flattened Luneburg lens, the device is able to modulate the retroreflected signal to achieve backscatter communications. We experimentally demonstrate full phase control of the backscattered signal across a range of incidence angles, spatial multiplexing, and secure communications against eavesdroppers by actively suppressing or randomizing signals in unwanted directions. The metasurface-backed Luneburg lens device offers a low-power solution for long-range wireless networks with advanced capabilities.

Title: Unsupervised Joint Learning of Optical Flow and Intensity with Event Cameras
Authors: Shuang Guo, Friedhelm Hamann, Guillermo Gallego
Abstract: Event cameras rely on motion to obtain information about scene appearance. This means that appearance and motion are inherently linked: either both are present and recorded in the event data, or neither is captured. Previous works treat the recovery of these two visual quantities as separate tasks, which does not fit with the above-mentioned nature of event cameras and overlooks the inherent relations between them. We propose an unsupervised learning framework that jointly estimates optical flow (motion) and image intensity (appearance) using a single network. From the data generation model, we newly derive the event-based photometric error as a function of optical flow and image intensity. This error is further combined with the contrast maximization framework to form a comprehensive loss function that provides proper constraints for both flow and intensity estimation. Exhaustive experiments show our method's state-of-the-art performance: in optical flow estimation, it reduces EPE by 20% and AE by 25% compared to unsupervised approaches, while delivering competitive intensity estimation results, particularly in high dynamic range scenarios. Our method also achieves shorter inference time than all other optical flow methods and many of the image reconstruction methods, while they output only one quantity. Project page: this https URL

Title: Balancing Robustness and Efficiency in Embedded DNNs Through Activation Function Selection
Authors: Jon Gutiérrez-Zaballa, Koldo Basterretxea, Javier Echanobe
Abstract: Machine learning-based embedded systems for safety-critical applications, such as aerospace and autonomous driving, must be robust to perturbations caused by soft errors. As transistor geometries shrink and voltages decrease, modern electronic devices become more susceptible to background radiation, increasing the concern about failures produced by soft errors. The resilience of deep neural networks (DNNs) to these errors depends not only on target device technology but also on model structure and the numerical representation and arithmetic precision of their parameters. Compression techniques like pruning and quantization, used to reduce memory footprint and computational complexity, alter both model structure and representation, affecting soft error robustness. In this regard, although often overlooked, the choice of activation functions (AFs) impacts not only accuracy and trainability but also compressibility and error resilience. This paper explores the use of bounded AFs to enhance robustness against parameter perturbations, while evaluating their effects on model accuracy, compressibility, and computational load with a technology-agnostic approach. We focus on encoder-decoder convolutional models developed for semantic segmentation of hyperspectral images with application to autonomous driving systems. Experiments are conducted on an AMD-Xilinx's KV260 SoM.

Authors: Hugo Chateau-Laurent, Tara Vanhatalo, Wei-Tung Pan, Xavier Hinaut
Abstract: Generative artificial intelligence raises concerns related to energy consumption, copyright infringement and creative atrophy. We show that randomly initialized recurrent neural networks can produce arpeggios and low-frequency oscillations that are rich and configurable. In contrast to end-to-end music generation that aims to replace musicians, our approach expands their creativity while requiring no data and much less computational power.

Title: Audio Geolocation: A Natural Sounds Benchmark
Authors: Mustafa Chasmai, Wuao Liu, Subhransu Maji, Grant Van Horn
Abstract: Can we determine someone's geographic location purely from the sounds they hear? Are acoustic signals enough to localize within a country, state, or even city? We tackle the challenge of global-scale audio geolocation, formalize the problem, and conduct an in-depth analysis with wildlife audio from the iNatSounds dataset. Adopting a vision-inspired approach, we convert audio recordings to spectrograms and benchmark existing image geolocation techniques. We hypothesize that species vocalizations offer strong geolocation cues due to their defined geographic ranges and propose an approach that integrates species range prediction with retrieval-based geolocation. We further evaluate whether geolocation improves when analyzing species-rich recordings or when aggregating across spatiotemporal neighborhoods. Finally, we introduce case studies from movies to explore multimodal geolocation using both audio and visual content. Our work highlights the advantages of integrating audio and visual cues, and sets the stage for future research in audio geolocation.

Title: Omni-Router: Sharing Routing Decisions in Sparse Mixture-of-Experts for Speech Recognition
Authors: Zijin Gu, Tatiana Likhomanenko, Navdeep Jaitly
Abstract: Mixture-of-experts (MoE) architectures have expanded from language modeling to automatic speech recognition (ASR). Traditional MoE methods, such as the Switch Transformer, route experts independently within each layer. Our analysis reveals that routers in most layers make expert choices that are not strongly correlated with the choices of the routers in other layers. To increase the cooperation between experts in different layers and encourage greater specialization, we use a shared router across different MoE layers. We call this model Omni-router Transformer. Extensive experiments on a large-scale pseudo-labeled dataset and evaluations across 10 diverse, out-of-domain ASR benchmarks demonstrate that the Omni-router Transformer is able to achieve lower training loss and consistently outperform dense and Switch Transformer models, reducing average word error rates by 11.2% and 8.2%, respectively, while providing structured expert usage and improved robustness to diverse data.

Title: Interpretable Gradient Descent for Kalman Gain
Authors: M.A. Belabbas, A. Olshevsky
Abstract: We derive a decomposition for the gradient of the innovation loss with respect to the filter gain in a linear time-invariant system, decomposing as a product of an observability Gramian and a term quantifying the ``non-orthogonality" between the estimation error and the innovation. We leverage this decomposition to give a convergence proof of gradient descent to the optimal Kalman gain, specifically identifying how recovery of the Kalman gain depends on a non-standard observability condition, and obtaining an interpretable geometric convergence rate.

Title: Music-Aligned Holistic 3D Dance Generation via Hierarchical Motion Modeling
Authors: Xiaojie Li, Ronghui Li, Shukai Fang, Shuzhao Xie, Xiaoyang Guo, Jiaqing Zhou, Junkun Peng, Zhi Wang
Abstract: Well-coordinated, music-aligned holistic dance enhances emotional expressiveness and audience engagement. However, generating such dances remains challenging due to the scarcity of holistic 3D dance datasets, the difficulty of achieving cross-modal alignment between music and dance, and the complexity of modeling interdependent motion across the body, hands, and face. To address these challenges, we introduce SoulDance, a high-precision music-dance paired dataset captured via professional motion capture systems, featuring meticulously annotated holistic dance movements. Building on this dataset, we propose SoulNet, a framework designed to generate music-aligned, kinematically coordinated holistic dance sequences. SoulNet consists of three principal components: (1) Hierarchical Residual Vector Quantization, which models complex, fine-grained motion dependencies across the body, hands, and face; (2) Music-Aligned Generative Model, which composes these hierarchical motion units into expressive and coordinated holistic dance; (3) Music-Motion Retrieval Module, a pre-trained cross-modal model that functions as a music-dance alignment prior, ensuring temporal synchronization and semantic coherence between generated dance and input music throughout the generation process. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SoulNet significantly surpasses existing approaches in generating high-quality, music-coordinated, and well-aligned holistic 3D dance sequences.
