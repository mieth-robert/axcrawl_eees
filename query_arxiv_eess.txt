Title: Multi-Task Corrupted Prediction for Learning Robust Audio-Visual Speech Representation
Authors: Sungnyun Kim, Sungwoo Cho, Sangmin Bae, Kangwook Jang, Se-Young Yun
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) incorporates auditory and visual modalities to improve recognition accuracy, particularly in noisy environments where audio-only speech systems are insufficient. While previous research has largely addressed audio disruptions, few studies have dealt with visual corruptions, e.g., lip occlusions or blurred videos, which are also detrimental. To address this real-world challenge, we propose CAV2vec, a novel self-supervised speech representation learning framework particularly designed to handle audio-visual joint corruption. CAV2vec employs a self-distillation approach with a corrupted prediction task, where the student model learns to predict clean targets, generated by the teacher model, with corrupted input frames. Specifically, we suggest a unimodal multi-task learning, which distills cross-modal knowledge and aligns the corrupted modalities, by predicting clean audio targets with corrupted videos, and clean video targets with corrupted audios. This strategy mitigates the dispersion in the representation space caused by corrupted modalities, leading to more reliable and robust audio-visual fusion. Our experiments on robust AVSR benchmarks demonstrate that the corrupted representation learning method significantly enhances recognition accuracy across generalized environments involving various types of corruption.

Title: Dual-Modality Computational Ophthalmic Imaging with Deep Learning and Coaxial Optical Design
Authors: Boyuan Peng, Jiaju Chen, Yiwei Zhang, Cuiyi Peng, Junyang Li, Jiaming Deng, Peiwu Qin
Abstract: The growing burden of myopia and retinal diseases necessitates more accessible and efficient eye screening solutions. This study presents a compact, dual-function optical device that integrates fundus photography and refractive error detection into a unified platform. The system features a coaxial optical design using dichroic mirrors to separate wavelength-dependent imaging paths, enabling simultaneous alignment of fundus and refraction modules. A Dense-U-Net-based algorithm with customized loss functions is employed for accurate pupil segmentation, facilitating automated alignment and focusing. Experimental evaluations demonstrate the system's capability to achieve high-precision pupil localization (EDE = 2.8 px, mIoU = 0.931) and reliable refractive estimation with a mean absolute error below 5%. Despite limitations due to commercial lens components, the proposed framework offers a promising solution for rapid, intelligent, and scalable ophthalmic screening, particularly suitable for community health settings.

Title: A Hybrid Framework for Efficient Koopman Operator Learning
Authors: Alexander Estornell, Leonard Jung, Alenna Spiro, Mario Sznaier, Michael Everett
Abstract: Koopman analysis of a general dynamics system provides a linear Koopman operator and an embedded eigenfunction space, enabling the application of standard techniques from linear analysis. However, in practice, deriving exact operators and mappings for the observable space is intractable, and deriving an approximation or expressive subset of these functions is challenging. Programmatic methods often rely on system-specific parameters and may scale poorly in both time and space, while learning-based approaches depend heavily on difficult-to-know hyperparameters, such as the dimension of the observable space. To address the limitations of both methods, we propose a hybrid framework that uses semidefinite programming to find a representation of the linear operator, then learns an approximate mapping into and out of the space that the operator propagates. This approach enables efficient learning of the operator and explicit mappings while reducing the need for specifying the unknown structure ahead of time.

Title: A Unified Alternating Optimization Framework for Joint Sensor and Actuator Configuration in LQG Systems
Authors: Nachuan Yang, Yuzhe Li, Ling Shi, Tongwen Chen
Abstract: This paper fills a gap in the literature by considering a joint sensor and actuator configuration problem under the linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) performance without assuming a predefined set of candidate components. Different from the existing research, which primarily focuses on selecting or placing sensors and actuators from a fixed group, we consider a more flexible formulation where these components must be designed from scratch, subject to general-form configuration costs and constraints. To address this challenge, we first analytically characterize the gradients of the LQG performance with respect to the sensor and actuator matrices using algebraic Riccati equations. Subsequently, we derive first-order optimality conditions based on the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) analysis and develop a unified alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM)-based alternating optimization framework to address the general-form sensor and actuator configuration problem. Furthermore, we investigate three representative scenarios: sparsity promoting configuration, low-rank promoting configuration, and structure-constrained configuration. For each scenario, we provide in-depth analysis and develop tailored computational schemes. The proposed framework ensures numerical efficiency and adaptability to various design constraints and configuration costs, making it well-suited for integration into numerical solvers.

Title: Nonconvex Linear System Identification with Minimal State Representation
Authors: Uday Kiran Reddy Tadipatri, Benjamin D. Haeffele, Joshua Agterberg, Ingvar Ziemann, René Vidal
Abstract: Low-order linear System IDentification (SysID) addresses the challenge of estimating the parameters of a linear dynamical system from finite samples of observations and control inputs with minimal state representation. Traditional approaches often utilize Hankel-rank minimization, which relies on convex relaxations that can require numerous, costly singular value decompositions (SVDs) to optimize. In this work, we propose two nonconvex reformulations to tackle low-order SysID (i) Burer-Monterio (BM) factorization of the Hankel matrix for efficient nuclear norm minimization, and (ii) optimizing directly over system parameters for real, diagonalizable systems with an atomic norm style decomposition. These reformulations circumvent the need for repeated heavy SVD computations, significantly improving computational efficiency. Moreover, we prove that optimizing directly over the system parameters yields lower statistical error rates, and lower sample complexities that do not scale linearly with trajectory length like in Hankel-nuclear norm minimization. Additionally, while our proposed formulations are nonconvex, we provide theoretical guarantees of achieving global optimality in polynomial time. Finally, we demonstrate algorithms that solve these nonconvex programs and validate our theoretical claims on synthetic data.

Title: Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model for Subsurface Diagnosis
Authors: Xiren Zhou, Shikang Liu, Xinyu Yan, Yizhan Fan, Xiangyu Wang, Yu Kang, Jian Cheng, Huanhuan Chen
Abstract: Urban roads and infrastructure, vital to city operations, face growing threats from subsurface anomalies like cracks and cavities. Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) effectively visualizes underground conditions employing electromagnetic (EM) waves; however, accurate anomaly detection via GPR remains challenging due to limited labeled data, varying subsurface conditions, and indistinct target boundaries. Although visually image-like, GPR data fundamentally represent EM waves, with variations within and between waves critical for identifying anomalies. Addressing these, we propose the Reservoir-enhanced Segment Anything Model (Res-SAM), an innovative framework exploiting both visual discernibility and wave-changing properties of GPR data. Res-SAM initially identifies apparent candidate anomaly regions given minimal prompts, and further refines them by analyzing anomaly-induced changing information within and between EM waves in local GPR data, enabling precise and complete anomaly region extraction and category determination. Real-world experiments demonstrate that Res-SAM achieves high detection accuracy (>85%) and outperforms state-of-the-art. Notably, Res-SAM requires only minimal accessible non-target data, avoids intensive training, and incorporates simple human interaction to enhance reliability. Our research provides a scalable, resource-efficient solution for rapid subsurface anomaly detection across diverse environments, improving urban safety monitoring while reducing manual effort and computational cost.

Title: DMA Reception for Simultaneous Area-Wide Sensing and Multi-User Uplink Communications
Authors: Ioannis Gavras, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: The recent surge in deploying extremely large antenna arrays is expected to play a vital role in future sixth generation wireless networks, enabling advanced radar target localization with enhanced angular and range resolution. This paper focuses on the promising technology of Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMAs), integrating numerous sub-wavelength-spaced metamaterials within a single aperture, and presents a novel framework for designing its analog reception beamforming weights with the goal to optimize sensing performance within a spatial Area of Interest (AoI), while simultaneously guaranteeing desired multi-user uplink communication performance. We derive the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) with DMA-based reception for both passive and active radar targets lying inside the AoI, which is then used as the optimization objective for configuring the discrete tunable phases of the metamaterials. Capitalizing on the DMA partially-connected architecture, we formulate the design problem as convex optimization and present both direct CRB minimization approaches and low complexity alternatives using a lower-bound approximation. Simulation results across various scenarios validate the effectiveness of the proposed framework, showing it consistently outperforms existing state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Tracking-Aided Multi-User MIMO Communications with Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Ioannis Gavras, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: Hybrid Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (HRISs) constitute a new paradigm that redefines smart metasurfaces, not only offering tunable reflections of incoming signals, but also incorporating signal reception and processing capabilities. In this paper, leveraging the simultaneous dual-functionality of HRISs, we propose a novel framework for tracking-aided multi-user Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) communications. In particular, a joint design of the transmit multi-user precoding matrix together with the HRIS reflection and analog combining configurations is presented, with the objective to maximize the accuracy of position estimation of multiple mobile users while meeting their individual quality-of-service constraints for sensing-aided communications. The Cramer-Rao bound for the users' positioning parameters is derived together with a prediction approach based on the extended Kalman filter. Our simulation results showcase the efficacy of the proposed Integrated Sensing And Communications (ISAC) framework over various system configuration parameters.

Title: BEM-Assisted Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for AFDM Systems over Doubly Selective Channels
Authors: Haowei Wu, Limin Liu, Jinglan Ou, Qihao Peng, Qu Luo, Pei Xiao, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation scheme of affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) based on generalized complex exponential basis expansion model (GCE-BEM) over doubly selective channels. The GCE-BEM is used to solve fractional Doppler dispersion while significantly reducing the computational complexity of exhaustive search. Then, the closed-form expression of channel estimation error is derived for the minimum mean square error (MMSE) estimation algorithm. Based on the estimated channel, the MMSE detection is adopt to characterize the impacts of estimated channel on bit error rate (BER) by deriving the theoretical lower bound. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme effectively mitigates severe inter-Doppler interference (IDoI). Our theoretical performance an alysis can perfectly match the Monte-Carlo results, validating the effectiveness of our proposed channel estimation based on GCE-BEM.

Title: Fairness-aware Dynamic Hosting Capacity and the Impacts of Strategic Solar PV Curtailment
Authors: Beyzanur Aydin, Rebecca Holt, Mads Almassalkhi
Abstract: Rapid deployment of distributed energy resources (DERs), such as solar photovoltaics (PV), poses a risk to the distribution grid under high penetration. Therefore, studying hosting capacity (HC) limits considering grid physics and demand variability is crucial. This paper introduces an improved framework for determining the HC of radial distribution networks by enhancing an existing convex inner approximation (CIA) approach. The proposed method achieves a more accurate and larger inner approximation, resulting in better HC limits. We also consider time-varying demand and the design of objective functions to ensure equitable access to grid resources. A case study with solar PV integration is conducted using a modified IEEE-37 radial network to examine the impact of increased PV capacity, demonstrating that with no more than 5% annual solar PV energy curtailed, it is possible to increase solar PV hosting capacity by at least 50% with no negative grid impacts and a net positive economic impact when accounted for the cost of carbon. Results show that fair allocation methods can lead to higher net profits and reduced PV curtailment and CO2.

Title: State Reconstruction Under Malicious Sensor Attacks
Authors: Wei Liu
Abstract: This paper considers the state reconstruction problem for discrete-time cyber-physical systems when some of the sensors can be arbitrarily corrupted by malicious attacks where the attacked sensors belong to an unknown set. We first prove that the state is $s$-error correctable if the system under consideration is $s$-sparse observable where $s$ denotes the maximum number of attacked sensors. Then, two state reconstruction methods are presented where the first method is based on searching elements with the same value in a set and the second method is developed in terms of searching element satisfying a given condition. In addition, after establishing and analyzing the conditions that the proposed state reconstruction methods are not effective, we address that it is very hard to prevent the state reconstruction when either state reconstruction method proposed in this paper is used. The correctness and effectiveness of the proposed methods are examined via an example of four-dimensional dynamic systems and a real-world example of three-inertia systems.

Title: Two-Agent DRL for Power Allocation and IRS Orientation in Dynamic NOMA-based OWC Networks
Authors: Ahrar N. Hamad, Ahmad Adnan Qidan, Taisir E.H. El-Gorashi, Jaafar M. H. Elmirghani
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) technology has been considered a promising solution in visible light communication (VLC) systems due to its potential to overcome the line-of-sight (LoS) blockage issue and enhance coverage. Moreover, integrating IRS with a downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) transmission technique for multi-users is a smart solution to achieve a high sum rate and improve system performance. In this paper, a dynamic IRS-assisted NOMA-VLC system is modeled, and an optimization problem is formulated to maximize sum energy efficiency (SEE) and fairness among multiple mobile users under power allocation and IRS mirror orientation constraints. Due to the non-convex nature of the optimization problem and the non-linearity of the constraints, conventional optimization methods are impractical for real-time solutions. Therefore, a two-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm is designed for optimizing power allocation and IRS orientation based on centralized training with decentralized execution to obtain fast and real-time solutions in dynamic environments. The results show the superior performance of the proposed DRL algorithm compared to standard DRL algorithms typically used for resource allocation in wireless communication. The results also show that the proposed DRL algorithm achieves higher performance compared to deployments without IRS and with randomly oriented IRS elements.

Title: Federated Learning-based Semantic Segmentation for Lane and Object Detection in Autonomous Driving
Authors: Gharbi Khamis Alshammari, Ahmad Abubakar, Nada M.O. Sid Ahmed, Naif Khalaf Alshammari
Abstract: Autonomous Vehicles (AVs) require precise lane and object detection to ensure safe navigation. However, centralized deep learning (DL) approaches for semantic segmentation raise privacy and scalability challenges, particularly when handling sensitive data. This research presents a new federated learning (FL) framework that integrates secure deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Differential Privacy (DP) to address these issues. The core contribution of this work involves: (1) developing a new hybrid UNet-ResNet34 architecture for centralized semantic segmentation to achieve high accuracy and tackle privacy concerns due to centralized training, and (2) implementing the privacy-preserving FL model, distributed across AVs to enhance performance through secure CNNs and DP mechanisms. In the proposed FL framework, the methodology distinguishes itself from the existing approach through the following: (a) ensuring data decentralization through FL to uphold user privacy by eliminating the need for centralized data aggregation, (b) integrating DP mechanisms to secure sensitive model updates against potential adversarial inference attacks, and (c) evaluating the frameworks performance and generalizability using RGB and semantic segmentation datasets derived from the CARLA simulator. Experimental results show significant improvements in accuracy, from 81.5% to 88.7% for the RGB dataset and from 79.3% to 86.9% for the SEG dataset over 20 to 70 Communication Rounds (CRs). Global loss was reduced by over 60%, and minor accuracy trade-offs from DP were observed. This study contributes by offering a scalable, privacy-preserving FL framework tailored for AVs, optimizing communication efficiency while balancing performance and data security.

Title: A Quadratic Programming Approach to Flight Envelope Protection Using Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Johannes Autenrieb
Abstract: Ensuring the safe operation of aerospace systems within their prescribed flight envelope is a fundamental requirement for modern flight control systems. Flight envelope protection prevents violations of aerodynamic, structural, and performance constraints, mitigating risks such as stall, excessive loads, and loss of control. Conventional FEP approaches, such as reference clipping via saturation functions and model-based command filtering, impose constraints at the reference input level but often fail to account for closed-loop system dynamics, potentially leading to constraint violations during transients. This paper introduces a new approach to the flight envelope protection problem by employing a quadratic programming-based safety filter using control barrier functions to dynamically enforce flight envelope constraints while preserving control performance. Unlike traditional reference filtering methods, the control barrier function-based safety filter actively ensures strict forward invariance of the safe flight envelope set, integrating seamlessly with existing control architectures. The proposed framework is implemented in a nonlinear missile flight control system and evaluated in a simulated environment. The results demonstrate its ability to prevent constraint violations while minimizing conservatism, offering a robust alternative to existing flight envelope protection methodologies.

Title: Surgeons vs. Computer Vision: A comparative analysis on surgical phase recognition capabilities
Authors: Marco Mezzina, Pieter De Backer, Tom Vercauteren, Matthew Blaschko, Alexandre Mottrie, Tinne Tuytelaars
Abstract: Purpose: Automated Surgical Phase Recognition (SPR) uses Artificial Intelligence (AI) to segment the surgical workflow into its key events, functioning as a building block for efficient video review, surgical education as well as skill assessment. Previous research has focused on short and linear surgical procedures and has not explored if temporal context influences experts' ability to better classify surgical phases. This research addresses these gaps, focusing on Robot-Assisted Partial Nephrectomy (RAPN) as a highly non-linear procedure. Methods: Urologists of varying expertise were grouped and tasked to indicate the surgical phase for RAPN on both single frames and video snippets using a custom-made web platform. Participants reported their confidence levels and the visual landmarks used in their decision-making. AI architectures without and with temporal context as trained and benchmarked on the Cholec80 dataset were subsequently trained on this RAPN dataset. Results: Video snippets and presence of specific visual landmarks improved phase classification accuracy across all groups. Surgeons displayed high confidence in their classifications and outperformed novices, who struggled discriminating phases. The performance of the AI models is comparable to the surgeons in the survey, with improvements when temporal context was incorporated in both cases. Conclusion: SPR is an inherently complex task for expert surgeons and computer vision, where both perform equally well when given the same context. Performance increases when temporal information is provided. Surgical tools and organs form the key landmarks for human interpretation and are expected to shape the future of automated SPR.

Title: Enhancing Cochlear Implant Signal Coding with Scaled Dot-Product Attention
Authors: Billel Essaid, Hamza Kheddar, Noureddine Batel
Abstract: Cochlear implants (CIs) play a vital role in restoring hearing for individuals with severe to profound sensorineural hearing loss by directly stimulating the auditory nerve with electrical signals. While traditional coding strategies, such as the advanced combination encoder (ACE), have proven effective, they are constrained by their adaptability and precision. This paper investigates the use of deep learning (DL) techniques to generate electrodograms for CIs, presenting our model as an advanced alternative. We compared the performance of our model with the ACE strategy by evaluating the intelligibility of reconstructed audio signals using the short-time objective intelligibility (STOI) metric. The results indicate that our model achieves a STOI score of 0.6031, closely approximating the 0.6126 score of the ACE strategy, and offers potential advantages in flexibility and adaptability. This study underscores the benefits of incorporating artificial intelligent (AI) into CI technology, such as enhanced personalization and efficiency.

Title: Versatile Framework for Song Generation with Prompt-based Control
Authors: Yu Zhang, Wenxiang Guo, Changhao Pan, Zhiyuan Zhu, Ruiqi Li, Jingyu Lu, Rongjie Huang, Ruiyuan Zhang, Zhiqing Hong, Ziyue Jiang, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Song generation focuses on producing controllable high-quality songs based on various prompts. However, existing methods struggle to generate vocals and accompaniments with prompt-based control and proper alignment. Additionally, they fall short in supporting various tasks. To address these challenges, we introduce VersBand, a multi-task song generation framework for synthesizing high-quality, aligned songs with prompt-based control. VersBand comprises these primary models: 1) VocalBand, a decoupled model, leverages the flow-matching method for generating singing styles, pitches, and mel-spectrograms, allowing fast, high-quality vocal generation with style control. 2) AccompBand, a flow-based transformer model, incorporates the Band-MOE, selecting suitable experts for enhanced quality, alignment, and control. This model allows for generating controllable, high-quality accompaniments aligned with vocals. 3) Two generation models, LyricBand for lyrics and MelodyBand for melodies, contribute to the comprehensive multi-task song generation system, allowing for extensive control based on multiple prompts. Experimental results demonstrate that VersBand performs better over baseline models across multiple song generation tasks using objective and subjective metrics.

Title: A Tutorial on MIMO-OFDM ISAC: From Far-Field to Near-Field
Authors: Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Huizhi Wang, Changsheng You, Chao Zhou, Hongqiang Cheng, Xiaoli Xu, Shi Jin, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Yonina C. Eldar, Robert Schober, Rui Zhang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where communication and sensing (C&S) services are simultaneously provided through shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in 6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths, higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the dominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very competitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate the potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing algorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by their extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW) characteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM ISAC.

Title: Modeling and Optimization of Transistor Voltage Amplifiers Based on Stochastic Thermodynamics
Authors: Xiaoxuan Peng, Xiaohu Ge
Abstract: As transistor sizes reach the mesoscopic scale, the limitations of traditional methods in ensuring thermodynamic consistency have made power dissipation optimization in transistor amplifiers a critical challenge. Based on stochastic thermodynamics, a transistor voltage amplifier model is first proposed as a new insight to investigate nonlinear relationships between the power dissipation and voltage gain for complementary symmetric voltage amplifier circuits (CSVACs). Utilizing the proposed model, the phenomenon, i.e., the power dissipation exponentially increases with the increase of voltage gain in CSVACs, is first clarified by an analytical expression to quantify the impact of voltage gain and input signal amplitude on the power dissipation. Considering the characteristic of power dissipation, a new multistage architecture is proposed to reduce the power dissipation in CSVACs. To optimize the power dissipation by adjusting the number of stages and the voltage gain at each stage, an optimal multistage scheme is proposed for multistage CSVACs. Simulation and experimental results show up to 99.36% and 94.59% power dissipation reduction compared with traditional CSVACs by the proposed optimal multistage scheme, respectively.

Title: MLICv2: Enhanced Multi-Reference Entropy Modeling for Learned Image Compression
Authors: Wei Jiang, Yongqi Zhai, Jiayu Yang, Feng Gao, Ronggang Wang
Abstract: Recent advancements in learned image compression (LIC) have yielded impressive performance gains. Notably, the learned image compression models with multi-reference entropy models (MLIC series) have significantly outperformed existing traditional image codecs such as the Versatile Video Coding (VVC) Intra. In this paper, we present MLICv2 and MLICv2$^+$, enhanced versions of the MLIC series, featuring improved transform techniques, entropy modeling, and instance adaptability. For better transform, we introduce a simple token mixing transform block inspired by the meta transformer architecture, addressing the performance degradation at high bit-rates observed in previous MLIC series while maintaining computational efficiency. To enhance entropy modeling, we propose a hyperprior-guided global correlation prediction, enabling the capture of global contexts in the initial slice of the latent representation. We also develop a channel reweighting module to dynamically prioritize important channels within each context. Additionally, advanced positional embedding for context modeling and selective compression with guided optimization are investigated. To boost instance adaptability, we employ stochastic Gumbel annealing to iteratively refine the latent representation according to the rate-distortion optimization of a specific input image. This approach further enhances performance without impacting decoding speed. Experimental results demonstrate that our MLICv2 and MLICv2$^+$ achieve state-of-the-art performance, reducing Bjontegaard-Delta rate (BD-rate) by 16.54%, 21.61%, 16.05% and 20.46%, 24.35%, 19.14% respectively, compared to VTM-17.0 Intra on the Kodak, Tecnick, CLIC Pro Val dataset, respectively.

Title: ODE-Former for Mobile Channel Prediction: A Novel Learning Structure Leveraging The Physics Continuity
Authors: Zhuoran Xiao
Abstract: Obtaining accurate channel state information (CSI) is crucial and challenging for multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) wireless communication systems. With the increasing antenna scale and user mobility, traditional channel estimation approaches suffer greatly from high signaling overhead and channel aging problems. By exploring the intrinsic correlation among a set of historical CSI instances, channel prediction is proven to increase the CSI accuracy while lowering the signaling overhead significantly. Existing works view this problem as a regular discrete sequence prediction task while ignoring the unique physics property of wireless channels. This letter proposes a novel former-like learning structure based on neural ordinary differential equations (NODEs) inclusively designed for accurate and flexible channel prediction. The proposed network aims to represent wireless channels' implicit physics spatial-temporal continuity by integrating the Neural ODE into a former-like learning structure. Our proposed method impeccably fits channel matrices' mathematics features and enjoys solid network interpretability. Experimental results show that the proposed learning approach outperforms existing methods from the perspective of accuracy, flexibility, and robustness.

Title: Coherent Source Enumeration with Compact ULAs
Authors: Dibakar Sil, Sunder Ram Krishnan, Kumar Vijay Mishra
Abstract: Source enumeration typically relies on subspace-based techniques that require accurate separation of signal and noise subspaces. However, prior works do not address coherent sources in small uniform linear arrays, where ambiguities arise in the spatial spectrum. We address this by decomposing the forward-backward smoothed covariance matrix into a sum of a rank-constrained Toeplitz matrix and a diagonal matrix with non-negative entries representing the signal and noise subspace, respectively. We solve the resulting non-convex optimization problem by proposing Toeplitz approach for rank-based target estimation (TARgEt) that employs the alternating direction method of multipliers. Numerical results on both synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of TARgEt over a recent subspace matching method and a related covariance matrix reconstruction approach.

Title: UAV-Aided Progressive Interference Source Localization Based on Improved Trust Region Optimization
Authors: Guochen Gu, Zhipeng Lin, Qiuming Zhu, Junchang Chen, Qihui Wu, Hongtao Duan, Yang Huang, Weizhi Zhong
Abstract: Trust region optimization-based received signal strength indicator (RSSI) interference source localization methods have been widely used in low-altitude research. However, these methods often converge to local optima in complex environments, degrading the positioning performance. This paper presents a novel unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-aided progressive interference source localization method based on improved trust region optimization. By combining the Levenberg-Marquardt (LM) algorithm with particle swarm optimization (PSO), our proposed method can effectively enhance the success rate of localization. We also propose a confidence quantification approach based on the UAV-to-ground channel model. This approach considers the surrounding environmental information of the sampling points and dynamically adjusts the weight of the sampling data during the data fusion. As a result, the overall positioning accuracy can be significantly improved. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method can achieve high-precision interference source localization in noisy and interference-prone environments.

Title: Comparison Research of Millimeter-Wave/Infrared Co-aperture Reflector Antenna Systems Based on a Specialized Film
Authors: Zongze Li, Xinlong Yang, Yiming Zhao, Chen Yao, Hongda Lu, Yong Liu
Abstract: This paper presents a novel co-aperture reflector antenna operating in millimeter-wave (MMW) and infrared (IR) for cloud detection radar. The proposed design combines a back-fed dual-reflector antenna, an IR optical reflection system, and a specialize thin film with IR-reflective/MMW-transmissive properties. Simulations demonstrate a gain exceeding 50 dBi within 94 GHz plush or minus 500 MHz bandwidth, with 0.46° beamwidth in both azimuth (E-plane) and elevation (H-plane) and sidelobe levels below -25 dB. This co-aperture architecture addresses the limitations of standalone MMW and IR radars, enabling high-resolution cloud microphysical parameter retrieval while minimizing system footprint. The design lays a foundation for airborne/spaceborne multi-mode detection systems.

Title: Meta-learning based Selective Fixed-filter Active Noise Control System with ResNet Classifier
Authors: Y. Xiao, M. Liu, D. Wei, L. Jian
Abstract: The selective fixed-filter strategy is popular in industrial applications involving active noise control (ANC) technology, which circumvents the time-consuming online learning process by selecting the best-matched pre-trained control filter. However, the existing selective fixed-filter ANC (SFANC) based algorithms classify noises in frequency band, which is not a reasonable approach. Moreover, they pre-train the control filter utilizing only a single noise segment, leading to inaccurate estimation and undesirable noise cancellation performance when dealing with dynamically time-varying noise. Inspired by the applicability of meta-learning to various models utilizing gradient descent technique, this paper proposes a novel meta-learning based SFANC system, wherein the fixed-filters that may not be optimal for specific types of noises but can rapidly adapt to previously unseen noise conditions are pre-trained. To address the mismatch issue between meta-learning update methods and ANC requirements while enhancing the receptive field and convergence speed of control filters, a multiple-input batch processing strategy is utilized in pre-training. Simulations based on the common ESC-50 noise dataset are performed and demonstrate the superiorities of the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy, convergence speed, and steady-state noise cancellation.

Title: Trajectory Planning with Model Predictive Control for Obstacle Avoidance Considering Prediction Uncertainty
Authors: Eric Schöneberg, Michael Schröder, Daniel Görges, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel trajectory planner for autonomous robots, specifically designed to enhance navigation by incorporating dynamic obstacle avoidance within the Robot Operating System 2 (ROS2) and Navigation 2 (Nav2) framework. The proposed method utilizes Model Predictive Control (MPC) with a focus on handling the uncertainties associated with the movement prediction of dynamic obstacles. Unlike existing Nav2 trajectory planners which primarily deal with static obstacles or react to the current position of dynamic obstacles, this planner predicts future obstacle positions using a stochastic Vector Auto-Regressive Model (VAR). The obstacles' future positions are represented by probability distributions, and collision avoidance is achieved through constraints based on the Mahalanobis distance, ensuring the robot avoids regions where obstacles are likely to be. This approach considers the robot's kinodynamic constraints, enabling it to track a reference path while adapting to real-time changes in the environment. The paper details the implementation, including obstacle prediction, tracking, and the construction of feasible sets for MPC. Simulation results in a Gazebo environment demonstrate the effectiveness of this method in scenarios where robots must navigate around each other, showing improved collision avoidance capabilities.

Title: Improving Generalization in MRI-Based Deep Learning Models for Total Knee Replacement Prediction
Authors: Ehsan Karami, Hamid Soltanian-Zadeh
Abstract: Knee osteoarthritis (KOA) is a common joint disease that causes pain and mobility issues. While MRI-based deep learning models have demonstrated superior performance in predicting total knee replacement (TKR) and disease progression, their generalizability remains challenging, particularly when applied to imaging data from different sources. In this study, we have shown that replacing batch normalization with instance normalization, using data augmentation, and applying contrastive loss improves model generalization in a baseline deep learning model for knee osteoarthritis (KOA) prediction. We trained and evaluated our model using MRI data from the Osteoarthritis Initiative (OAI) database, considering sagittal fat-suppressed intermediate-weighted turbo spin-echo (FS-IW-TSE) images as the source domain and sagittal fat-suppressed three-dimensional (3D) dual-echo in steady state (DESS) images as the target domain. The results demonstrate a statistically significant improvement in classification accuracy across both domains, with our approach outperforming the baseline model.

Title: Near-Field Collinear Dipole Array Design with Dual-Polarization Operation for Wireless Power Transfer
Authors: Jiawang Li
Abstract: A large intelligent surface (LIS) is a promising approach to enhancing 6G performance in sub-10 GHz frequency bands. An analysis of the horizontal dipole linear array reveals that when the array size is sufficiently large, employing the conjugate phase method to excite the antenna elements results in a focal point along the central line of the array that gradually stabilizes at a constant value. The study evaluates the 3dB focal resolution generated by the dipole array for two polarizations. Additionally, the feasibility of generating circularly polarized focal points and the focal displacement under a limited array size are explored. Previous near-field focal synthesis methods primarily considered only the line-of-sight (LOS) channel. To enhance practicality, this study adopts a two-ray channel model to analyze near-field focal synthesis results in the presence of a reflected path. Both two polarizations are discussed separately, with design guidelines provided for array placement and focal point positioning. Finally, electromagnetic simulations are conducted within the linear array to validate the proposed design. These simulations highlight the capability of the horizontal dipole array configuration to be directly applied without significant coupling effects between elements. The proposed design guidelines lay a solid foundation for the application of LIS in 6G technology.

Title: Optimal Azimuth Sampling and Interpolation for Bistatic ISAC Setups
Authors: Alexander Felix, Silvio Mandelli, Marcus Henninger, Stephan ten Brink
Abstract: A key challenge in future 6G Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC) networks is to define the angular operations of transmitter and receiver, i.e., the sampling task of the angular domains, to acquire information about the environment. In this work we extend previous analysis for optimal angular sampling of monostatic setups to two-dimensional bistatic deployments, that are as important as the former in future ISAC cellular scenarios. Our approach overcomes the limitations of suboptimal prior art sampling and interpolation techniques, such as spline interpolation. We demonstrate that separating azimuth operations of the two transmit and receive arrays is optimal to sample the angular domain in an array-specific normalized angular frequency (NAF). This allows us to derive a loss-less reconstruction of the angular domain, enabling a more efficient and accurate sampling strategy for bistatic sensing applications compared to legacy approaches. As demonstrated by different Monte Carlo experiments, our approach enables future bistatic ISAC deployments with better performance compared to the other suboptimal solutions.

Title: Target Detection for ISAC with TDD Transmission
Authors: Marcus Henninger, Lucas Giroto de Oliveira, Stephan Saur, Artjom Grudnitsky, Thorsten Wild, Silvio Mandelli
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) poses various challenges that arise from the communication-centric design of cellular networks. One of them is target detection with time division duplex (TDD) transmission used in current 5G and future 6G deployments, where the periodic on-off behavior of the transmitter creates impulsive sidelobes in the radar point spread function (PSF). These can be mistaken for actual targets by conventional peak detection techniques, leading to false alarms. In this work, we first analytically describe the range-Doppler PSF due to TDD windowing. We then propose a computationally efficient method that leverages the PSF to distinguish impulsive sidelobes from valid target peaks. Simulation results and outdoor drone measurements with an ISAC proof of concept demonstrate the capability of our algorithm, showing that it can achieve reliable target detection while limiting false alarms.

Title: Super-resolution Wideband Beam Training for Near-field Communications with Ultra-low Overhead
Authors: Cong Zhou, Changsheng You, Shuo Shi, Jiasi Zhou, Chenyu Wu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a super-resolution wideband beam training method for near-field communications, which is able to achieve ultra-low overhead. To this end, we first study the multi-beam characteristic of a sparse uniform linear array (S-ULA) in the wideband. Interestingly, we show that this leads to a new beam pattern property, called rainbow blocks, where the S-ULA generates multiple grating lobes and each grating lobe is further splitted into multiple versions in the wideband due to the well-known beam-split effect. As such, one directional beamformer based on S-ULA is capable of generating multiple rainbow blocks in the wideband, hence significantly extending the beam coverage. Then, by exploiting the beam-split effect in both the frequency and spatial domains, we propose a new three-stage wideband beam training method for extremely large-scale array (XL-array) systems. Specifically, we first sparsely activate a set of antennas at the central of the XL-array and judiciously design the time-delay (TD) parameters to estimate candidate user angles by comparing the received signal powers at the user over subcarriers. Next, to resolve the angular ambiguity introduced by the S-ULA, we activate all antennas in the central subarray and design an efficient subcarrier selection scheme to estimate the true user angle. In the third stage, we resolve the user range at the estimated user angle with high resolution by controlling the splitted beams over subcarriers to simultaneously cover the range domain. Finally, numerical results are provided to demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed wideband beam training scheme, which only needs three pilots in near-field beam training, while achieving near-optimal rate performance.

Title: Low-Rank Adaptive Structural Priors for Generalizable Diabetic Retinopathy Grading
Authors: Yunxuan Wang, Ray Yin, Yumei Tan, Hao Chen, Haiying Xia
Abstract: Diabetic retinopathy (DR), a serious ocular complication of diabetes, is one of the primary causes of vision loss among retinal vascular diseases. Deep learning methods have been extensively applied in the grading of diabetic retinopathy (DR). However, their performance declines significantly when applied to data outside the training distribution due to domain shifts. Domain generalization (DG) has emerged as a solution to this challenge. However, most existing DG methods overlook lesion-specific features, resulting in insufficient accuracy. In this paper, we propose a novel approach that enhances existing DG methods by incorporating structural priors, inspired by the observation that DR grading is heavily dependent on vessel and lesion structures. We introduce Low-rank Adaptive Structural Priors (LoASP), a plug-and-play framework designed for seamless integration with existing DG models. LoASP improves generalization by learning adaptive structural representations that are finely tuned to the complexities of DR diagnosis. Extensive experiments on eight diverse datasets validate its effectiveness in both single-source and multi-source domain scenarios. Furthermore, visualizations reveal that the learned structural priors intuitively align with the intricate architecture of the vessels and lesions, providing compelling insights into their interpretability and diagnostic relevance.

Title: Dual Attention Driven Lumbar Magnetic Resonance Image Feature Enhancement and Automatic Diagnosis of Herniation
Authors: Lingrui Zhang, Liang Guo, Xiao An, Feng Lin, Binlong Zheng, Jiankun Wang, Zhirui Li
Abstract: Lumbar disc herniation (LDH) is a common musculoskeletal disease that requires magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) for effective clinical management. However, the interpretation of MRI images heavily relies on the expertise of radiologists, leading to delayed diagnosis and high costs for training physicians. Therefore, this paper proposes an innovative automated LDH classification framework. To address these key issues, the framework utilizes T1-weighted and T2-weighted MRI images from 205 people. The framework extracts clinically actionable LDH features and generates standardized diagnostic outputs by leveraging data augmentation and channel and spatial attention mechanisms. These outputs can help physicians make confident and time-effective care decisions when needed. The proposed framework achieves an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC-ROC) of 0.969 and an accuracy of 0.9486 for LDH detection. The experimental results demonstrate the performance of the proposed framework. Our framework only requires a small number of datasets for training to demonstrate high diagnostic accuracy. This is expected to be a solution to enhance the LDH detection capabilities of primary hospitals.

Title: Negative Imaginary Neural ODEs: Learning to Control Mechanical Systems with Stability Guarantees
Authors: Kanghong Shi, Ruigang Wang, Ian R. Manchester
Abstract: We propose a neural control method to provide guaranteed stabilization for mechanical systems using a novel negative imaginary neural ordinary differential equation (NINODE) controller. Specifically, we employ neural networks with desired properties as state-space function matrices within a Hamiltonian framework to ensure the system possesses the NI property. This NINODE system can serve as a controller that asymptotically stabilizes an NI plant under certain conditions. For mechanical plants with colocated force actuators and position sensors, we demonstrate that all the conditions required for stability can be translated into regularity constraints on the neural networks used in the controller. We illustrate the utility, effectiveness, and stability guarantees of the NINODE controller through an example involving a nonlinear mass-spring system.

Title: Novel Selection Schemes for Multi-RIS-Assisted Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Mahmoud Aldababsa, Taissir Y. Elganimi, Mahmoud A. Albreem, Saeed Abdallah
Abstract: This paper investigates the performance of a multi-reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted fluid antenna system (FAS). In this system, a single-antenna transmitter communicates with a receiver equipped with a planar FAS through multiple RISs in the absence of a direct link. To enhance the system performance, we propose two novel selection schemes: \textit{Max-Max} and \textit{Max-Sum}. In particular, the \textit{Max-Max} scheme selects the best combination of a single RIS and a single fluid antenna (FA) port that offers the maximum signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver. On the other hand, the \textit{Max-Sum} scheme selects one RIS while activating all FA ports providing the highest overall SNR. We conduct a detailed performance analysis of the proposed system under Nakagami-$m$ fading channels. First, we derive the cumulative distribution function (CDF) of the SNR for both selection schemes. The derived CDF is then used to obtain approximate theoretical expressions for the outage probability (OP) and the delay outage rate (DOR). Next, a high-SNR asymptotic analysis is carried out to provide further insights into the system performance in terms of diversity and coding gains. Finally, the analytical results are validated through extensive Monte Carlo simulations, demonstrating their accuracy and providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance.

Title: Discrete-time Two-Layered Forgetting RLS Identification under Finite Excitation
Authors: Satoshi Tsuruhara, Kazuhisa Ito
Abstract: In recent years, adaptive identification methods that can achieve the true value convergence of parameters without requiring persistent excitation (PE) have been widely studied, and concurrent learning has been intensively studied. However, the parameter convergence rate is limited for the gradient-based method owing to small parameter update gain, and even the introduction of forgetting factors does not work sufficiently. To address this problem, this study proposes a novel discrete-time recursive least squares method under finite excitation (FE) conditions using two forgetting factors (inner and outer) and an augmented regressor matrix comprising a sum of regressor vectors. The proposed method ensures the PE condition of the augmented regressor matrix under FE conditions of the regressor vector and allows the properly design of the forgetting factor without estimator windup and/or destabilization of the system. Numerical simulations demonstrate its effectiveness by comparing it with several conventional methods.

Title: A Model-based DNN for Learning HMIMO Beamforming
Authors: Shiyong Chen, Shengqian Han
Abstract: Holographic MIMO (HMIMO) is a promising technique for large-scale MIMO systems to enhance spectral efficiency while maintaining low hardware cost and power consumption. Existing alternating optimization algorithms can effectively optimize the hybrid beamforming of HMIMO to improve the system performance, while their high computational complexity hinders real-time application. In this paper, we propose a model-based deep neural network (MB-DNN), which leverages permutation equivalent properties and the optimal beamforming structure to jointly optimize the holographic and digital beamforming. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed MB-DNN outperforms benchmark schemes and requires much less inference time than existing alternating optimization algorithms.

Title: Systematic Hardware Integration Testing for Smart Video-based Medical Device Prototypes
Authors: Oliver Bause, Julia Werner, Oliver Bringmann
Abstract: This paper presents a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) verification system for intelligent, camera-based in-body medical devices. A case study of a Video Capsule Endoscopy (VCE) prototype is used to illustrate the system's functionality. The field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based approach simulates the capsule's traversal through the strointestinal (GI) tract by injecting on-demand pre-recorded images from VCE studies. It is demonstrated that the HIL configuration is capable of meeting the real-time requirements of the prototypes and automatically identifying errors. The integration of machine learning (ML) hardware accelerators within medical devices can be facilitated by utilising this configuration, as it enables the verification of its functionality prior to the initiation of clinical testing.

Title: Event-triggered Robust Model Predictive Control under Hard Computation Resource Constraints
Authors: Alexander Gräfe, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: Model predictive control (MPC) is capable of controlling nonlinear systems with guaranteed constraint satisfaction and stability. However, MPC requires solving optimization problems online periodically, which often exceeds the local system's computational capabilities. A potential solution is to leverage external processing, such as a central industrial server. Yet, this central computer typically serves multiple systems simultaneously, leading to significant hardware demands due to the need to solve numerous optimization problems concurrently. In this work, we tackle this challenge by developing an event-triggered model predictive control (ET-MPC) that provably stabilizes multiple nonlinear systems under disturbances while solving only optimization problems for a fixed-size subset at any given time. Unlike existing ET-MPC methods, which primarily reduce average computational load yet still require hardware capable of handling all systems simultaneously, our approach reduces the worst-case computational load. This significantly lowers central server hardware requirements by diminishing peak computational demands. We achieve our improvements by leveraging recent advancements in distributed event-triggered linear control and integrating them with a robust MPC that employs constraint tightening.

Title: Deployment Optimization for XL-IRS Assisted Multi-User Communications
Authors: Chao Zhou, Changsheng You, Tianyu Liu, Bin Lyu
Abstract: In this paper, we study the deployment optimization for an extremely large-scale intelligent reflecting surface (XL-IRS) assisted multi-user communication system, within which the channels between the XL-IRS and the BS (or user) are modeled by the near-field spherical wavefronts. To draw some valuable insights, we first consider the single-user case, where an alternating optimization (AO) based algorithm is devised to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user. To address the high computational complexity issue incurred by the AO based algorithm, three approximate received SNR expressions are obtained to yield useful insights, corresponding to the upper bound, approximate expression, and closed-form. It is demonstrated that the XL-IRS ought to be positioned near the user (rather than the BS) to obtain a higher beamforming gain. Then, for the multi-user scenario, an efficient algorithm is proposed to obtain a high-quality XL-IRS placement solution by using the AO and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Furthermore, the effective degree of freedom (DoF) of the BS-IRS channel is provided, which indicates that the additional effective DoF can be leveraged to improve multi-user spatial multiplexing. Last, numerical results confirm the existence of a trade-off between near-field beam-focusing gain and multiplexing gain.

Title: Physical-Layer Security in Mixed Near-Field and Far-Field Communication Systems
Authors: Tianyu Liu, Changsheng You, Cong Zhou, Yunpu Zhang, Shiqi Gong, Heng Liu, Guangchi Zhang
Abstract: Extremely large-scale arrays (XL-arrays) have emerged as a promising technology to improve the spectrum efficiency and spatial resolution of future wireless systems. Different from existing works that mostly considered physical layer security (PLS) in either the far-field or near-field, we consider in this paper a new and practical scenario, where legitimate users (Bobs) are located in the far-field of a base station (BS) while eavesdroppers (Eves) are located in the near-field for intercepting confidential information at short distance, referred to as the mixed near-field and far-field PLS. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the sum-secrecy-rate of all Bobs by optimizing the power allocation of the BS, subject to the constraint on the total BS transmit power. To shed useful insights, we first consider a one-Bob-one-Eve system and characterize the insecure-transmission region of the Bob in closed form. Interestingly, we show that the insecure-transmission region is significantly \emph{expanded} as compared to that in conventional far-field PLS systems, due to the energy-spread effect in the mixed-field scenario. Then, we further extend the analysis to a two-Bob-one-Eve system. It is revealed that as compared to the one-Bob system, the interferences from the other Bob can be effectively used to weaken the capability of Eve for intercepting signals of target Bobs, thus leading to enhanced secrecy rates. Furthermore, we propose an efficient algorithm to obtain a high-quality solution to the formulated non-convex problem by leveraging the successive convex approximation (SCA) technique. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that our proposed algorithm achieves a higher sum-secrecy-rate than the benchmark scheme where the power allocation is designed based on the (simplified) far-field channel model.

Title: Semantic Packet Aggregation for Token Communication via Genetic Beam Search
Authors: Seunghun Lee, Jihong Park, Jinho Choi, Hyuncheol Park
Abstract: Token communication (TC) is poised to play a pivotal role in emerging language-driven applications such as AI-generated content (AIGC) and wireless language models (LLMs). However, token loss caused by channel noise can severely degrade task performance. To address this, in this article, we focus on the problem of semantics-aware packetization and develop a novel algorithm, termed semantic packet aggregation with genetic beam search (SemPA-GBeam), which aims to maximize the average token similarity (ATS) over erasure channels. Inspired from the genetic algorithm (GA) and the beam search algorithm, SemPA-GBeam iteratively optimizes token grouping for packetization within a fixed number of groups (i.e., fixed beam width in beam search) while randomly swapping a fraction of tokens (i.e., mutation in GA). Experiments on the MS-COCO dataset demonstrate that SemPA-GBeam achieves ATS and LPIPS scores comparable to exhaustive search while reducing complexity by more than 20x.

Title: Towards Robust Multimodal Physiological Foundation Models: Handling Arbitrary Missing Modalities
Authors: Xi Fu, Wei-Bang Jiang, Yi Ding, Cuntai Guan
Abstract: Multimodal physiological signals, such as EEG, ECG, EOG, and EMG, are crucial for healthcare and brain-computer interfaces. While existing methods rely on specialized architectures and dataset-specific fusion strategies, they struggle to learn universal representations that generalize across datasets and handle missing modalities at inference time. To address these issues, we propose PhysioOmni, a foundation model for multimodal physiological signal analysis that models both homogeneous and heterogeneous features to decouple multimodal signals and extract generic representations while maintaining compatibility with arbitrary missing modalities. PhysioOmni trains a decoupled multimodal tokenizer, enabling masked signal pre-training via modality-invariant and modality-specific objectives. To ensure adaptability to diverse and incomplete modality combinations, the pre-trained encoders undergo resilient fine-tuning with prototype alignment on downstream datasets. Extensive experiments on four downstream tasks, emotion recognition, sleep stage classification, motor prediction, and mental workload detection, demonstrate that PhysioOmni achieves state-of-the-art performance while maintaining strong robustness to missing modalities. Our code and model weights will be released.

Title: A Comparative Study on Positional Encoding for Time-frequency Domain Dual-path Transformer-based Source Separation Models
Authors: Kohei Saijo, Tetsuji Ogawa
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the impact of positional encoding (PE) on source separation performance and the generalization ability to long sequences (length extrapolation) in Transformer-based time-frequency (TF) domain dual-path models. The length extrapolation capability in TF-domain dual-path models is a crucial factor, as it affects not only their performance on long-duration inputs but also their generalizability to signals with unseen sampling rates. While PE is known to significantly impact length extrapolation, there has been limited research that explores the choice of PEs for TF-domain dual-path models from this perspective. To address this gap, we compare various PE methods using a recent state-of-the-art model, TF-Locoformer, as the base architecture. Our analysis yields the following key findings: (i) When handling sequences that are the same length as or shorter than those seen during training, models with PEs achieve better performance. (ii) However, models without PE exhibit superior length extrapolation. This trend is particularly pronounced when the model contains convolutional layers.

Title: Data-Driven Sensor Fault Diagnosis with Proven Guarantees using Incrementally Stable Recurrent Neural Networks
Authors: Farhad Ghanipoor, Carlos Murguia, Giancarlo Ferrari Trecate, Nathan van de Wouw
Abstract: Robust Recurrent Neural Networks (R-RENs) are a class of neural networks that have built-in system-theoretic robustness and incremental stability properties. In this manuscript, we leverage these properties to construct a data-driven Fault Detection and Isolation (FDI) method for sensor faults with proven performance guarantees. The underlying idea behind the scheme is to construct a bank of multiple R-RENs (acting as fault isolation filters), each with different levels of sensitivity (increased or decreased) to faults at different sensors. That is, each R-REN is designed to be specifically sensitive to faults occurring in a particular sensor and robust against faults in all the others. The latter is guaranteed using the built-in incremental stability properties of R-RENs. The proposed method is unsupervised (as it does not require labeled data from faulty sensors) and data-driven (because it exploits available fault-free input-output system trajectories and does not rely on dynamic models of the system under study). Numerical simulations on a roll-plane model of a vehicle demonstrate the effectiveness and practical applicability of the proposed methodology.

Title: Model-based controller assisted domain randomization in deep reinforcement learning: application to nonlinear powertrain control
Authors: Heisei Yonezawa, Ansei Yonezawa, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: Complex mechanical systems such as vehicle powertrains are inherently subject to multiple nonlinearities and uncertainties arising from parametric variations. Modeling and calibration errors are therefore unavoidable, making the transfer of control systems from simulation to real-world systems a critical challenge. Traditional robust controls have limitations in handling certain types of nonlinearities and uncertainties, requiring a more practical approach capable of comprehensively compensating for these various constraints. This study proposes a new robust control approach using the framework of deep reinforcement learning (DRL). The key strategy lies in the synergy among domain randomization-based DRL, long short-term memory (LSTM)-based actor and critic networks, and model-based control (MBC). The problem setup is modeled via the latent Markov decision process (LMDP), a set of vanilla MDPs, for a controlled system subject to uncertainties and nonlinearities. In LMDP, the dynamics of an environment simulator is randomized during training to improve the robustness of the control system to real testing environments. The randomization increases training difficulties as well as conservativeness of the resultant control system; therefore, progress is assisted by concurrent use of a model-based controller based on a nominal system model. Compared to traditional DRL-based controls, the proposed controller design is smarter in that we can achieve a high level of generalization ability with a more compact neural network architecture and a smaller amount of training data. The proposed approach is verified via practical application to active damping for a complex powertrain system with nonlinearities and parametric variations. Comparative tests demonstrate the high robustness of the proposed approach.

Title: Sum-Rate Optimisation of a Multi-User STAR-RIS-Aided System with Low Complexity
Authors: Sadaf Syed, Wolfgang Utschick, Michael Joham
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a promising technology for future wireless communication systems. However, the conventional RIS can only reflect the incident signal. Hence, it provides a limited coverage, as compared to a simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS). Prior works on the STAR-RIS address the power minimisation or the sum-rate maximisation problem by reformulating the objective problem as a convex optimisation problem and then employing numerical tools like CVX to obtain the solution, which introduces significant computational complexity leading to a huge runtime, making the algorithms impractical for real-world implementation. In this paper, we propose a low complexity solution for the optimisation of a multi-user STAR-RIS system, where the non-convex optimisation problem is decomposed into multiple convex sub-problems with closed-form optimal solutions. The simulation results illustrate that our proposed algorithm achieves similar performance to CVX-based solutions in the literature while being computationally efficient.

Title: Lossy Beyond Diagonal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Yiyang Peng, Hongyu Li, Zheyu Wu, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Beyond diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS) has emerged as an advancement and generalization of the conventional diagonal RIS (D-RIS) by introducing tunable interconnections between RIS elements, enabling smarter wave manipulation and enlarged coverage. While BD-RIS has demonstrated advantages over D-RIS in various aspects, most existing works rely on the assumption of a lossless model, leaving practical considerations unaddressed. This paper thus proposes a lossy BD-RIS model and develops corresponding optimization algorithms for various BD-RIS-aided communication systems. First, by leveraging admittance parameter analysis, we model each tunable admittance based on a lumped circuit with losses and derive an expression of a circle characterizing the real and imaginary parts of each tunable admittance. We then consider the received signal power maximization in single-user single-input single-output (SISO) systems with the proposed lossy BD-RIS model. To solve the optimization problem, we design an effective algorithm by carefully exploiting the problem structure. Specifically, an alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) framework is custom-designed to deal with the complicated constraints associated with lossy BD-RIS. Furthermore, we extend the proposed algorithmic framework to more general multiuser multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) systems, where the transmit precoder and BD-RIS scattering matrix are jointly designed to maximize the sum-rate of the system. Finally, simulation results demonstrate that all BD-RIS architectures still outperform D-RIS in the presence of losses, but the optimal BD-RIS architectures in the lossless case are not necessarily optimal in the lossy case, e.g. group-connected BD-RIS can outperform fully- and tree-connected BD-RISs in SISO systems with relatively high losses, whereas the opposite always holds true in the lossless case.

Title: Spectral Analysis of Approximated Capacity Fade Curvature for Lithium-Ion Batteries
Authors: Huang Zhang, Torsten Wik
Abstract: The techno-economic benefits of incorporating battery degradation into advanced control strategies necessitate the development of degradation diagnosis as an advanced function in battery management systems (BMSs). To address this, a curvature-based knee identification method was proposed in our previous work [1]. Here, we further validate its effectiveness on a new battery aging dataset under a realistic driving profile and conduct spectral analysis of the approximated capacity fade curvature. The curvature-based method shows consistent knee identification performance on this dataset and the approximated curvature is found to correlate with underlying degradation modes and a shift of electrode material phase transition points. The method uses capacity data as the only input, which is easy to acquire in the lab and it is applicable in battery energy storage systems for grid applications.

Title: Logic-based Resilience Computation of Power Systems Against Frequency Requirements
Authors: Negar Monir, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: Incorporating renewable energy sources into modern power grids has significantly decreased system inertia, which has raised concerns about power system vulnerability to disturbances and frequency instability. The conventional methods for evaluating transient stability by bounding frequency deviations are often conservative and may not accurately reflect real-world conditions and operational constraints. To address this, we propose a framework for assessing the resilience of power systems against disturbances while adhering to realistic operational frequency constraints. Our approach leverages the Lure system representation of power system dynamics and Signal Temporal Logic (STL) to capture the essential frequency response requirements set by grid operators. This enables us to translate frequency constraints into formal robustness semantics. We then formulate an optimization problem to identify the maximum disturbance that the system can withstand without violating these constraints. The resulting optimization is translated into a scenario optimization while addressing the uncertainty in the obtained solution. The proposed methodology has been simulated on the Single Machine Infinite Bus case study and 9-Bus IEEE benchmark system, demonstrating its effectiveness in assessing resilience across various operating conditions and delivering promising results.

Title: Polarized pulse pair observations during a long duration interstellar communication experiment
Authors: William J. Crilly jr
Abstract: In prior work, conducted since 2017, two celestial pointing directions have been observed to be associated with the measurement of anomalous high counts of narrow bandwidth, short duration, polarized radio frequency pulse pairs. The prior experimental work utilized up to three geographically-spaced synchronized radio telescopes, a single-dish radio telescope, and a radio interferometer. The experimental work reported here examines full right ascension coverage at one declination, utilizing the interferometer, during 124.1 days. Results suggest the possible presence of an additional anomalous celestial pointing direction. Seven standard deviations of noise-modeled shifts of mean polarized pulse pair count were observed in three celestial directions. Indications of interferometer space delay aliasing were observed. A phase noise test, celestial source identification methods and associated measurements were used to seek potential explanations of the unusual observed phenomena.

Title: Low-Complexity Channel Estimation Protocol for Non-Diagonal RIS-Assisted Communications
Authors: Mostafa Samy, Hayder Al-Hraishawi, Abuzar B. M. Adam, Madyan Alsenwi, Symeon Chatzinotas, Björn Otteresten
Abstract: Non-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) offer enhanced wireless signal manipulation over conventional RIS by enabling the incident signal on any of its $M$ elements to be reflected from another element via an $M \times M$ switch array. To fully exploit this flexible configuration, the acquisition of individual channel state information (CSI) is essential. However, due to the passive nature of the RIS, cascaded channel estimation is performed, as the RIS itself lacks signal processing capabilities. This entails estimating the CSI for all $M \times M$ switch array permutations, resulting in a total of $M!$ possible configurations, to identify the optimal one that maximizes the channel gain. This process leads to long uplink training intervals, which degrade spectral efficiency and increase uplink energy consumption. In this paper, we propose a low-complexity channel estimation protocol that substantially reduces the need for exhaustive $M!$ permutations by utilizing only three configurations to optimize the non-diagonal RIS switch array and beamforming for single-input single-output (SISO) and multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. Specifically, our three-stage pilot-based protocol estimates scaled versions of the user-RIS and RIS-base-station (BS) channels in the first two stages using the least square (LS) estimator and the commonly used ON/OFF protocol from conventional RIS. In the third stage, the cascaded user-RIS-BS channels are estimated to enable efficient beamforming optimization. Complexity analysis shows that our proposed protocol significantly reduces the BS computational load from $\mathcal{O}(NM\times M!)$ to $\mathcal{O}(NM)$, where $N$ is the number of BS antennas. This complexity is similar to the conventional ON/OFF-based LS estimation for conventional diagonal RIS.

Title: Reinforcement Learning-Based Heterogeneous Multi-Task Optimization in Semantic Broadcast Communications
Authors: Zhilin Lu, Rongpeng Li, Zhifeng Zhao, Honggang Zhang
Abstract: Semantic broadcast communications (Semantic BC) for image transmission have achieved significant performance gains for single-task scenarios. Nevertheless, extending these methods to multi-task scenarios remains challenging, as different tasks typically require distinct objective functions, leading to potential conflicts within the shared encoder. In this paper, we propose a tri-level reinforcement learning (RL)-based multi-task Semantic BC framework, termed SemanticBC-TriRL, which effectively resolves such conflicts and enables the simultaneous support of multiple downstream tasks at the receiver side, including image classification and content reconstruction tasks. Specifically, the proposed framework employs a bottom-up tri-level alternating learning strategy, formulated as a constrained multi-objective optimization problem. At the first level, task-specific decoders are locally optimized using supervised learning. At the second level, the shared encoder is updated via proximal policy optimization (PPO), guided by task-oriented rewards. At the third level, a multi-gradient aggregation-based task weighting module adaptively adjusts task priorities and steers the encoder optimization. Through this hierarchical learning process, the encoder and decoders are alternately trained, and the three levels are cohesively integrated via constrained learning objective. Besides, the convergence of SemanticBC-TriRL is also theoretically established. Extensive simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed framework across diverse channel conditions, particularly in low SNR regimes, and confirm its scalability with increasing numbers of receivers.

Title: Digital Twin-based Out-of-Distribution Detection in Autonomous Vessels
Authors: Erblin Isaku, Hassan Sartaj, Shaukat Ali
Abstract: An autonomous vessel (AV) is a complex cyber-physical system (CPS) with software enabling many key functionalities, e.g., navigation software enables an AV to autonomously or semi-autonomously follow a path to its destination. Digital twins of such AVs enable advanced functionalities such as running what-if scenarios, performing predictive maintenance, and enabling fault diagnosis. Due to technological improvements, real-time analyses using continuous data from vessels' real-time operations have become increasingly possible. However, the literature has little explored developing advanced analyses in real-time data in AVs with digital twins built with machine learning techniques. To this end, we present a novel digital twin-based approach (ODDIT) to detect future out-of-distribution (OOD) states of an AV before reaching them, enabling proactive intervention. Such states may indicate anomalies requiring attention (e.g., manual correction by the ship master) and assist testers in scenario-centered testing. The digital twin consists of two machine-learning models predicting future vessel states and whether the predicted state will be OOD. We evaluated ODDIT with five vessels across waypoint and zigzag maneuvering under simulated conditions, including sensor and actuator noise and environmental disturbances i.e., ocean current. ODDIT achieved high accuracy in detecting OOD states, with AUROC and TNR@TPR95 scores reaching 99\% across multiple vessels.

Title: Clustering-based Recurrent Neural Network Controller synthesis under Signal Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Kazunobu Serizawa, Kazumune Hashimoto, Wataru Hashimoto, Masako Kishida, Shigemasa Takai
Abstract: Autonomous robotic systems require advanced control frameworks to achieve complex temporal objectives that extend beyond conventional stability and trajectory tracking. Signal Temporal Logic (STL) provides a formal framework for specifying such objectives, with robustness metrics widely employed for control synthesis. Existing optimization-based approaches using neural network (NN)-based controllers often rely on a single NN for both learning and control. However, variations in initial states and obstacle configurations can lead to discontinuous changes in the optimization solution, thereby degrading generalization and control performance. To address this issue, this study proposes a method to enhance recurrent neural network (RNN)-based control by clustering solution trajectories that satisfy STL specifications under diverse initial conditions. The proposed approach utilizes trajectory similarity metrics to generate clustering labels, which are subsequently used to train a classification network. This network assigns new initial states and obstacle configurations to the appropriate cluster, enabling the selection of a specialized controller. By explicitly accounting for variations in solution trajectories, the proposed method improves both estimation accuracy and control performance. Numerical experiments on a dynamic vehicle path planning problem demonstrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Abstract: The perfect alignment of 3D echocardiographic images captured from various angles has improved image quality and broadened the field of view. This study proposes an accelerated sequential Monte Carlo (SMC) algorithm for 3D-3D rigid registration of transthoracic echocardiographic images with significant and limited overlap taken from apical window that is robust to the noise and intensity variation in ultrasound images. The algorithm estimates the translational and rotational components of the rigid transform through an iterative process and requires an initial approximation of the rotation and translation limits. We perform registration in two ways: the image-based registration computes the transform to align the end-diastolic frame of the apical nonstandard image to the apical standard image and applies the same transform to all frames of the cardiac cycle, whereas the mask-based registration approach uses the binary masks of the left ventricle in the same way. The SMC and exhaustive search (EX) algorithms were evaluated for 4D temporal sequences recorded from 7 volunteers who participated in a study conducted at the Mazankowski Alberta Heart Institute. The evaluations demonstrate that the mask-based approach of the accelerated SMC yielded a Dice score value of 0.819 +/- 0.045 for the left ventricle and gained 16.7x speedup compared to the CPU version of the SMC algorithm.

Authors: Tzu-Hsuan Hsu, Kapil Saha, Jack Kramer, Omar Barrera, Pietro Simoni, Matteo Rinaldi, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: In this work, an Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) on Diamond Sezawa-mode surface acoustic wave (SAW) platform for RF filtering at Ku-band (12-18 GHz) is demonstrated. Thanks to the high acoustic velocity and low-loss diamond substrate, the prototype resonator at 12.9 GHz achieves a high phase velocity ($v_p$) of 8671 m/s, a maximum Bode-$Q$ of 408, and coupling coefficient ($k_{\mathrm{eff}}^2$) of 2.1%, outperforming high-velocity substrates such as SiC and sapphire by more than 20% in velocity. Resonators spanning 8-18 GHz are presented. The platform's high power handling above 12.5 dBm is also experimentally validated.

Title: SST-DUNet: Automated preclinical functional MRI skull stripping using Smart Swin Transformer and Dense UNet
Authors: Sima Soltanpour, Rachel Utama, Arnold Chang, Md Taufiq Nasseef, Dan Madularu, Praveen Kulkarni, Craig Ferris, Chris Joslin
Abstract: Skull stripping is a common preprocessing step that is often performed manually in Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) pipelines, including functional MRI (fMRI). This manual process is time-consuming and operator dependent. Automating this process is challenging for preclinical data due to variations in brain geometry, resolution, and tissue contrast. While existing methods for MRI skull stripping exist, they often struggle with the low resolution and varying slice sizes in preclinical fMRI data. This study proposes a novel method called SST-DUNet, that integrates a dense UNet-based architecture with a feature extractor based on Smart Swin Transformer (SST) for fMRI skull stripping. The Smart Shifted Window Multi-Head Self-Attention (SSW-MSA) module in SST is adapted to replace the mask-based module in the Swin Transformer (ST), enabling the learning of distinct channel-wise features while focusing on relevant dependencies within brain structures. This modification allows the model to better handle the complexities of fMRI skull stripping, such as low resolution and variable slice sizes. To address the issue of class imbalance in preclinical data, a combined loss function using Focal and Dice loss is utilized. The model was trained on rat fMRI images and evaluated across three in-house datasets with a Dice similarity score of 98.65%, 97.86%, and 98.04%. The fMRI results obtained through automatic skull stripping using the SST-DUNet model closely align with those from manual skull stripping for both seed-based and independent component analyses. These results indicate that the SST-DUNet can effectively substitute manual brain extraction in rat fMRI analysis.

Title: Capturing Aerodynamic Characteristics of ATTAS Aircraft with Evolving Intelligent System
Authors: Aydoğan Soylu, Tufan Kumbasar
Abstract: Accurate modeling of aerodynamic coefficients is crucial for understanding and optimizing the performance of modern aircraft systems. This paper presents the novel deployment of an Evolving Type-2 Quantum Fuzzy Neural Network (eT2QFNN) for modeling the aerodynamic coefficients of the ATTAS aircraft to express the aerodynamic characteristics. eT2QFNN can represent the nonlinear aircraft model by creating multiple linear submodels with its rule-based structure through an incremental learning strategy rather than a traditional batch learning approach. Moreover, it enhances robustness to uncertainties and data noise through its quantum membership functions, as well as its automatic rule-learning and parameter-tuning capabilities. During the estimation of the aerodynamic coefficients via the flight data of the ATTAS, two different studies are conducted in the training phase: one with a large amount of data and the other with a limited amount of data. The results show that the modeling performance of the eT2QFNN is superior in comparison to baseline counterparts. Furthermore, eT2QFNN estimated the aerodynamic model with fewer rules compared to Type-1 fuzzy counterparts. In addition, by applying the Delta method to the proposed approach, the stability and control derivatives of the aircraft are analyzed. The results prove the superiority of the proposed eT2QFNN in representing aerodynamic coefficients.

Title: Data-Driven Stabilization of Unknown Linear-Threshold Network Dynamics
Authors: Xuan Wang, Duy Duong-Tran, Jorge Cortés
Abstract: This paper studies the data-driven control of unknown linear-threshold network dynamics to stabilize the state to a reference value. We consider two types of controllers: (i) a state feedback controller with feed-forward reference input and (ii) an augmented feedback controller with error integration. The first controller features a simpler structure and is easier to design, while the second offers improved performance in the presence of system parameter changes and disturbances. Our design strategy employs state-input datasets to construct data-based representations of the closed-loop dynamics. Since these representations involve linear threshold functions, we rewrite them as switched linear systems, and formulate the design problem as that of finding a common controller for all the resulting modes. This gives rise to a set of linear matrix inequalities (LMIs) whose solutions corresponds to the controller gain matrices. We analyze the computational complexity of solving the LMIs and propose a simplified, sufficient set of conditions that scales linearly with the system state. Simulations on two case studies involving regulation of firing rate dynamics in rodent brains and of arousal level dynamics in humans demonstrate the effectiveness of the controller designs.

Title: Low-Bit Integerization of Vision Transformers using Operand Reodering for Efficient Hardware
Authors: Ching-Yi Lin, Sahil Shah
Abstract: Pre-trained vision transformers have achieved remarkable performance across various visual tasks but suffer from expensive computational and memory costs. While model quantization reduces memory usage by lowering precision, these models still incur significant computational overhead due to the dequantization before matrix operations. In this work, we analyze the computation graph and propose an integerization process based on operation reordering. Specifically, the process delays dequantization until after matrix operations. This enables integerized matrix multiplication and linear module by directly processing the quantized input. To validate our approach, we synthesize the self-attention module of ViT on a systolic array-based hardware. Experimental results show that our low-bit inference reduces per-PE power consumption for linear layer and matrix multiplication, bridging the gap between quantized models and efficient inference.

Title: Enhancing Privacy in Semantic Communication over Wiretap Channels leveraging Differential Privacy
Authors: Weixuan Chen, Shunpu Tang, Qianqian Yang, Zhiguo Shi, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) improves transmission efficiency by focusing on task-relevant information. However, transmitting semantic-rich data over insecure channels introduces privacy risks. This paper proposes a novel SemCom framework that integrates differential privacy (DP) mechanisms to protect sensitive semantic features. This method employs the generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion technique to extract disentangled semantic features and uses neural networks (NNs) to approximate the DP application and removal processes, effectively mitigating the non-invertibility issue of DP. Additionally, an NN-based encryption scheme is introduced to strengthen the security of channel inputs. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively prevents eavesdroppers from reconstructing sensitive information by generating chaotic or fake images, while ensuring high-quality image reconstruction for legitimate users. The system exhibits robust performance across various privacy budgets and channel conditions, achieving an optimal balance between privacy protection and reconstruction fidelity.

Title: Speaker Diarization for Low-Resource Languages Through Wav2vec Fine-Tuning
Authors: Abdulhady Abas Abdullah, Sarkhel H. Taher Karim, Sara Azad Ahmed, Kanar R. Tariq, Tarik A. Rashid
Abstract: Speaker diarization is a fundamental task in speech processing that involves dividing an audio stream by speaker. Although state-of-the-art models have advanced performance in high-resource languages, low-resource languages such as Kurdish pose unique challenges due to limited annotated data, multiple dialects and frequent code-switching. In this study, we address these issues by training the Wav2Vec 2.0 self-supervised learning model on a dedicated Kurdish corpus. By leveraging transfer learning, we adapted multilingual representations learned from other languages to capture the phonetic and acoustic characteristics of Kurdish speech. Relative to a baseline method, our approach reduced the diarization error rate by seven point two percent and improved cluster purity by thirteen percent. These findings demonstrate that enhancements to existing models can significantly improve diarization performance for under-resourced languages. Our work has practical implications for developing transcription services for Kurdish-language media and for speaker segmentation in multilingual call centers, teleconferencing and video-conferencing systems. The results establish a foundation for building effective diarization systems in other understudied languages, contributing to greater equity in speech technology.

Title: Unsupervised outlier detection to improve bird audio dataset labels
Authors: Bruce Collins
Abstract: The Xeno-Canto bird audio repository is an invaluable resource for those interested in vocalizations and other sounds made by birds around the world. This is particularly the case for machine learning researchers attempting to improve on the bird species recognition accuracy of classification models. However, the task of extracting labeled datasets from the recordings found in this crowd-sourced repository faces several challenges. One challenge of particular significance to machine learning practitioners is that one bird species label is applied to each audio recording, but frequently other sounds are also captured including other bird species, other animal sounds, anthropogenic and other ambient sounds. These non-target bird species sounds can result in dataset labeling discrepancies referred to as label noise. In this work we present a cleaning process consisting of audio preprocessing followed by dimensionality reduction and unsupervised outlier detection (UOD) to reduce the label noise in a dataset derived from Xeno-Canto recordings. We investigate three neural network dimensionality reduction techniques: two flavors of convolutional autoencoders and variational deep embedding (VaDE (Jiang, 2017)). While both methods show some degree of effectiveness at detecting outliers for most bird species datasets, we found significant variation in the performance of the methods from one species to the next. We believe that the results of this investigation demonstrate that the application of our cleaning process can meaningfully reduce the label noise of bird species datasets derived from Xeno-Canto audio repository but results vary across species.

Title: Foundations of Safe Online Reinforcement Learning in the Linear Quadratic Regulator: $\sqrt{T}$-Regret
Authors: Benjamin Schiffer, Lucas Janson
Abstract: Understanding how to efficiently learn while adhering to safety constraints is essential for using online reinforcement learning in practical applications. However, proving rigorous regret bounds for safety-constrained reinforcement learning is difficult due to the complex interaction between safety, exploration, and exploitation. In this work, we seek to establish foundations for safety-constrained reinforcement learning by studying the canonical problem of controlling a one-dimensional linear dynamical system with unknown dynamics. We study the safety-constrained version of this problem, where the state must with high probability stay within a safe region, and we provide the first safe algorithm that achieves regret of $\tilde{O}_T(\sqrt{T})$. Furthermore, the regret is with respect to the baseline of truncated linear controllers, a natural baseline of non-linear controllers that are well-suited for safety-constrained linear systems. In addition to introducing this new baseline, we also prove several desirable continuity properties of the optimal controller in this baseline. In showing our main result, we prove that whenever the constraints impact the optimal controller, the non-linearity of our controller class leads to a faster rate of learning than in the unconstrained setting.

Title: Learning-Based Modeling of Soft Actuators Using Euler Spiral-Inspired Curvature
Authors: Yu Mei, Shangyuan Yuan, Xinda Qi, Preston Fairchild, Xiaobo Tan
Abstract: Soft robots, distinguished by their inherent compliance and continuum structures, present unique modeling challenges, especially when subjected to significant external loads such as gravity and payloads. In this study, we introduce an innovative data-driven modeling framework leveraging an Euler spiral-inspired shape representations to accurately describe the complex shapes of soft continuum actuators. Based on this representation, we develop neural network-based forward and inverse models to effectively capture the nonlinear behavior of a fiber-reinforced pneumatic bending actuator. Our forward model accurately predicts the actuator's deformation given inputs of pressure and payload, while the inverse model reliably estimates payloads from observed actuator shapes and known pressure inputs. Comprehensive experimental validation demonstrates the effectiveness and accuracy of our proposed approach. Notably, the augmented Euler spiral-based forward model achieves low average positional prediction errors of 3.38%, 2.19%, and 1.93% of the actuator length at the one-third, two-thirds, and tip positions, respectively. Furthermore, the inverse model demonstrates precision of estimating payloads with an average error as low as 0.72% across the tested range. These results underscore the potential of our method to significantly enhance the accuracy and predictive capabilities of modeling frameworks for soft robotic systems.

Title: Certifiably-Correct Mapping for Safe Navigation Despite Odometry Drift
Authors: Devansh R. Agrawal, Taekyung Kim, Rajiv Govindjee, Trushant Adeshara, Jiangbo Yu, Anurekha Ravikumar, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: Accurate perception, state estimation and mapping are essential for safe robotic navigation as planners and controllers rely on these components for safety-critical decisions. However, existing mapping approaches often assume perfect pose estimates, an unrealistic assumption that can lead to incorrect obstacle maps and therefore collisions. This paper introduces a framework for certifiably-correct mapping that ensures that the obstacle map correctly classifies obstacle-free regions despite the odometry drift in vision-based localization systems (VIO}/SLAM). By deflating the safe region based on the incremental odometry error at each timestep, we ensure that the map remains accurate and reliable locally around the robot, even as the overall odometry error with respect to the inertial frame grows unbounded. Our contributions include two approaches to modify popular obstacle mapping paradigms, (I) Safe Flight Corridors, and (II) Signed Distance Fields. We formally prove the correctness of both methods, and describe how they integrate with existing planning and control modules. Simulations using the Replica dataset highlight the efficacy of our methods compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Real-world experiments with a robotic rover show that, while baseline methods result in collisions with previously mapped obstacles, the proposed framework enables the rover to safely stop before potential collisions.

Title: Spatial Speech Translation: Translating Across Space With Binaural Hearables
Authors: Tuochao Chen, Qirui Wang, Runlin He, Shyam Gollakota
Abstract: Imagine being in a crowded space where people speak a different language and having hearables that transform the auditory space into your native language, while preserving the spatial cues for all speakers. We introduce spatial speech translation, a novel concept for hearables that translate speakers in the wearer's environment, while maintaining the direction and unique voice characteristics of each speaker in the binaural output. To achieve this, we tackle several technical challenges spanning blind source separation, localization, real-time expressive translation, and binaural rendering to preserve the speaker directions in the translated audio, while achieving real-time inference on the Apple M2 silicon. Our proof-of-concept evaluation with a prototype binaural headset shows that, unlike existing models, which fail in the presence of interference, we achieve a BLEU score of up to 22.01 when translating between languages, despite strong interference from other speakers in the environment. User studies further confirm the system's effectiveness in spatially rendering the translated speech in previously unseen real-world reverberant environments. Taking a step back, this work marks the first step towards integrating spatial perception into speech translation.

Title: Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Virtual Histopathology: Diagnostic Equivalence to Gold-Standard H&E Staining in Skin Cancer Excisional Biopsies
Authors: Benjamin R. Ecclestone, James E. D. Tweel, Marie Abi Daoud, Hager Gaouda, Deepak Dinakaran, Michael P. Wallace, Ally Khan Somani, Gilbert Bigras, John R. Mackey, Parsin Haji Reza
Abstract: Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) enables label-free imaging of subcellular morphology by observing biomolecule specific absorption interactions. Coupled with deep-learning, PARS produces label-free virtual Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images in unprocessed tissues. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of these PARS-derived virtual H&E images in benign and malignant excisional skin biopsies, including Squamous (SCC), Basal (BCC) Cell Carcinoma, and normal skin. Sixteen unstained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin excisions were PARS imaged, virtually H&E stained, then chemically stained and imaged at 40x. Seven fellowship trained dermatopathologists assessed all 32 images in a masked randomized fashion. Concordance analysis indicates 95.5% agreement between primary diagnoses rendered on PARS versus H&E images (Cohen's k=0.93). Inter-rater reliability was near-perfect for both image types (Fleiss' k=0.89 for PARS, k=0.80 for H&E). For subtype classification, agreement was near-perfect 91% (k=0.73) for SCC and was perfect for BCC. When assessing malignancy confinement (e.g., cancer margins), agreement was 92% between PARS and H&E (k=0.718). During assessment dermatopathologists could not reliably distinguish image origin (PARS vs. H&E), and diagnostic confidence was equivalent between the modalities. Inter-rater reliability for PARS virtual H&E was consistent with reported benchmarks for histologic evaluation. These results indicate that PARS virtual histology may be diagnostically equivalent to traditional H&E staining in dermatopathology diagnostics, while enabling assessment directly from unlabeled, or unprocessed slides. In turn, the label-free PARS virtual H&E imaging workflow may preserve tissue for downstream analysis while producing data well-suited for AI integration potentially accelerating and enhancing the accuracy of skin cancer diagnostics.

Title: A Survey on Multimodal Music Emotion Recognition
Authors: Rashini Liyanarachchi, Aditya Joshi, Erik Meijering
Abstract: Multimodal music emotion recognition (MMER) is an emerging discipline in music information retrieval that has experienced a surge in interest in recent years. This survey provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in MMER. Discussing the different approaches and techniques used in this field, the paper introduces a four-stage MMER framework, including multimodal data selection, feature extraction, feature processing, and final emotion prediction. The survey further reveals significant advancements in deep learning methods and the increasing importance of feature fusion techniques. Despite these advancements, challenges such as the need for large annotated datasets, datasets with more modalities, and real-time processing capabilities remain. This paper also contributes to the field by identifying critical gaps in current research and suggesting potential directions for future research. The gaps underscore the importance of developing robust, scalable, a interpretable models for MMER, with implications for applications in music recommendation systems, therapeutic tools, and entertainment.

Title: Theoretical Framework for Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent: Application to Breast Cancer Classification
Authors: Omar Naifar
Abstract: This paper introduces Tempered Fractional Gradient Descent (TFGD), a novel optimization framework that synergizes fractional calculus with exponential tempering to enhance gradient-based learning. Traditional gradient descent methods often suffer from oscillatory updates and slow convergence in high-dimensional, noisy landscapes. TFGD addresses these limitations by incorporating a tempered memory mechanism, where historical gradients are weighted by fractional coefficients $|w_j| = \binom{\alpha}{j}$ and exponentially decayed via a tempering parameter $\lambda$. Theoretical analysis establishes TFGD's convergence guarantees: in convex settings, it achieves an $\mathcal{O}(1/K)$ rate with alignment coefficient $d_{\alpha,\lambda} = (1 - e^{-\lambda})^{-\alpha}$, while stochastic variants attain $\mathcal{O}(1/k^\alpha)$ error decay. The algorithm maintains $\mathcal{O}(n)$ time complexity equivalent to SGD, with memory overhead scaling as $\mathcal{O}(d/\lambda)$ for parameter dimension $d$. Empirical validation on the Breast Cancer Wisconsin dataset demonstrates TFGD's superiority, achieving 98.25\% test accuracy (vs. 92.11\% for SGD) and 2$\times$ faster convergence. The tempered memory mechanism proves particularly effective in medical classification tasks, where feature correlations benefit from stable gradient averaging. These results position TFGD as a robust alternative to conventional optimizers in both theoretical and applied machine learning.

Title: Cross Far- and Near-Field Beam Management Technologies in Millimeter-Wave and Terahertz MIMO Systems
Authors: Yuhang Chen, Heyin Shen, Chong Han
Abstract: The evolution of wireless communication toward next-generation networks introduces unprecedented demands on data rates, latency, and connectivity. To meet these requirements, two key trends have emerged: the use of higher communication frequencies to provide broader bandwidth, and the deployment of massive multiple-input multiple-output systems with large antenna arrays to compensate for propagation losses and enhance spatial multiplexing. These advancements significantly extend the Rayleigh distance, enabling near-field (NF) propagation alongside the traditional far-field (FF) regime. As user communication distances dynamically span both FF and NF regions, cross-field (CF) communication has also emerged as a practical consideration. Beam management (BM)-including beam scanning, channel state information estimation, beamforming, and beam tracking-plays a central role in maintaining reliable directional communications. While most existing BM techniques are developed for FF channels, recent works begin to address the unique characteristics of NF and CF regimes. This survey presents a comprehensive review of BM techniques from the perspective of propagation fields. We begin by building the basic through analyzing the modeling of FF, NF, and CF channels, along with the associated beam patterns for alignment. Then, we categorize BM techniques by methodologies, and discuss their operational differences across propagation regimes, highlighting how field-dependent channel characteristics influence design tradeoffs and implementation complexity. In addition, for each BM method, we identify open challenges and future research directions, including extending FF methods to NF or CF scenarios, developing unified BM strategies for field-agnostic deployment, and designing low-overhead BM solutions for dynamic environments.

Title: Diffeomorphic Obstacle Avoidance for Contractive Dynamical Systems via Implicit Representations
Authors: Ken-Joel Simmoteit, Philipp Schillinger, Leonel Rozo
Abstract: Ensuring safety and robustness of robot skills is becoming crucial as robots are required to perform increasingly complex and dynamic tasks. The former is essential when performing tasks in cluttered environments, while the latter is relevant to overcome unseen task situations. This paper addresses the challenge of ensuring both safety and robustness in dynamic robot skills learned from demonstrations. Specifically, we build on neural contractive dynamical systems to provide robust extrapolation of the learned skills, while designing a full-body obstacle avoidance strategy that preserves contraction stability via diffeomorphic transforms. This is particularly crucial in complex environments where implicit scene representations, such as Signed Distance Fields (SDFs), are necessary. To this end, our framework called Signed Distance Field Diffeomorphic Transform, leverages SDFs and flow-based diffeomorphisms to achieve contraction-preserving obstacle avoidance. We thoroughly evaluate our framework on synthetic datasets and several real-world robotic tasks in a kitchen environment. Our results show that our approach locally adapts the learned contractive vector field while staying close to the learned dynamics and without introducing highly-curved motion paths, thus outperforming several state-of-the-art methods.

Title: WLTCL: Wide Field-of-View 3-D LiDAR Truck Compartment Automatic Localization System
Authors: Guodong Sun, Mingjing Li, Dingjie Liu, Mingxuan Liu, Bo Wu, Yang Zhang
Abstract: As an essential component of logistics automation, the automated loading system is becoming a critical technology for enhancing operational efficiency and safety. Precise automatic positioning of the truck compartment, which serves as the loading area, is the primary step in automated loading. However, existing methods have difficulty adapting to truck compartments of various sizes, do not establish a unified coordinate system for LiDAR and mobile manipulators, and often exhibit reliability issues in cluttered environments. To address these limitations, our study focuses on achieving precise automatic positioning of key points in large, medium, and small fence-style truck compartments in cluttered scenarios. We propose an innovative wide field-of-view 3-D LiDAR vehicle compartment automatic localization system. For vehicles of various sizes, this system leverages the LiDAR to generate high-density point clouds within an extensive field-of-view range. By incorporating parking area constraints, our vehicle point cloud segmentation method more effectively segments vehicle point clouds within the scene. Our compartment key point positioning algorithm utilizes the geometric features of the compartments to accurately locate the corner points, providing stackable spatial regions. Extensive experiments on our collected data and public datasets demonstrate that this system offers reliable positioning accuracy and reduced computational resource consumption, leading to its application and promotion in relevant fields.

Title: Closed-Form Expressions for I/O Relation in Zak-OTFS with Different Delay-Doppler Filters
Authors: Arpan Das, Fathima Jesbin, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam
Abstract: The transceiver operations in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain in Zak-OTFS modulation, including DD domain filtering at the transmitter and receiver, involve twisted convolution operation. The twisted convolution operations give rise to multiple integrals in the end-to-end DD domain input-output (I/O) relation. The I/O relation plays a crucial role in performance evaluation and algorithm development for transceiver implementation. In this paper, we derive discrete DD domain closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. We derive these expressions for sinc and Gaussian pulse shaping DD filters at the transmitter (Tx). On the receiver (Rx) side, three types of DD filters are considered, viz., $(i)$ Rx filter identical to Tx filter (referred to as `identical filtering'), $(ii)$ Rx filter matched to the Tx filter (referred to as `matched filtering'), and $(iii)$ Rx filter matched to both Tx filter and channel response (referred to as `channel matched filtering'). For all the above cases, except for the case of sinc identical filtering, we derive exact I/O relation and noise covariance expressions in closed-form. For the sinc identical filtering case, we derive approximate closed-form expressions which are shown to be accurate. Using the derived closed-form expressions, we evaluate the bit error performance of Zak-OTFS for different Tx/Rx filter configurations. Our results using Vehicular-A (Veh-A) channel model with fractional DDs show that, while matched filtering achieves slightly better or almost same performance as identical filtering, channel matched filtering achieves the best performance among the three.

Title: Glider Path Design and Control for Reconstructing Three-Dimensional Structures of Oceanic Mesoscale Eddies
Authors: Wu Su, Xiaoyuan E, Zhao Jing, Song Xi Chen
Abstract: Underwater gliders offer effective means in oceanic surveys with a major task in reconstructing the three-dimensional hydrographic field of a mesoscale eddy. This paper considers three key issues in the hydrographic reconstruction of mesoscale eddies with the sampled data from the underwater gliders. It first proposes using the Thin Plate Spline (TPS) as the interpolation method for the reconstruction with a blocking scheme to speed up the computation. It then formulates a procedure for selecting glider path design that minimizes the reconstruction errors among a set of pathway formations. Finally we provide a glider path control procedure to guide the glider to follow to designed pathways as much as possible in the presence of ocean current. A set of optimization algorithms are experimented and several with robust glider control performance on a simulated eddy are identified.

Title: Asynchronous Push-sum Dual Gradient Algorithm in Distributed Model Predictive Control
Authors: Pengbiao Wang, Xuemei Ren, Dongdong Zheng
Abstract: This paper studies the distributed model predictive control (DMPC) problem for distributed discrete-time linear systems with both local and global constraints over directed communication networks. We establish an optimization problem to formulate the DMPC policy, including the design of terminal ingredients. To cope with the global constraint, we transform the primal optimization problem into its dual problem. Then, we propose a novel asynchronous push-sum dual gradient (APDG) algorithm with an adaptive step-size scheme to solve this dual problem in a fully asynchronous distributed manner. The proposed algorithm does not require synchronous waiting and any form of coordination, which greatly improves solving efficiency. We theoretically prove that the APDG algorithm converges at an R-linear rate as long as the step-size does not exceed the designed upper bound. Furthermore, we develop a distributed termination criterion to terminate the APDG algorithm when its output solution satisfies the specified suboptimality and the global constraint, thereby avoiding an infinite number of iterations. The recursive feasibility and the stability of the closed-loop system are also established. Finally, a numerical example clarifies and validates theoretical findings.

Title: Speaker Retrieval in the Wild: Challenges, Effectiveness and Robustness
Authors: Erfan Loweimi, Mengjie Qian, Kate Knill, Mark Gales
Abstract: There is a growing abundance of publicly available or company-owned audio/video archives, highlighting the increasing importance of efficient access to desired content and information retrieval from these archives. This paper investigates the challenges, solutions, effectiveness, and robustness of speaker retrieval systems developed "in the wild" which involves addressing two primary challenges: extraction of task-relevant labels from limited metadata for system development and evaluation, as well as the unconstrained acoustic conditions encountered in the archive, ranging from quiet studios to adverse noisy environments. While we focus on the publicly-available BBC Rewind archive (spanning 1948 to 1979), our framework addresses the broader issue of speaker retrieval on extensive and possibly aged archives with no control over the content and acoustic conditions. Typically, these archives offer a brief and general file description, mostly inadequate for specific applications like speaker retrieval, and manual annotation of such large-scale archives is unfeasible. We explore various aspects of system development (e.g., speaker diarisation, embedding extraction, query selection) and analyse the challenges, possible solutions, and their functionality. To evaluate the performance, we conduct systematic experiments in both clean setup and against various distortions simulating real-world applications. Our findings demonstrate the effectiveness and robustness of the developed speaker retrieval systems, establishing the versatility and scalability of the proposed framework for a wide range of applications beyond the BBC Rewind corpus.

Title: Unveiling and Mitigating Adversarial Vulnerabilities in Iterative Optimizers
Authors: Elad Sofer, Tomer Shaked, Caroline Chaux, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) models are often sensitive to carefully crafted yet seemingly unnoticeable perturbations. Such adversarial examples are considered to be a property of ML models, often associated with their black-box operation and sensitivity to features learned from data. This work examines the adversarial sensitivity of non-learned decision rules, and particularly of iterative optimizers. Our analysis is inspired by the recent developments in deep unfolding, which cast such optimizers as ML models. We show that non-learned iterative optimizers share the sensitivity to adversarial examples of ML models, and that attacking iterative optimizers effectively alters the optimization objective surface in a manner that modifies the minima sought. We then leverage the ability to cast iteration-limited optimizers as ML models to enhance robustness via adversarial training. For a class of proximal gradient optimizers, we rigorously prove how their learning affects adversarial sensitivity. We numerically back our findings, showing the vulnerability of various optimizers, as well as the robustness induced by unfolding and adversarial training.

Title: Improving Pretrained YAMNet for Enhanced Speech Command Detection via Transfer Learning
Authors: Sidahmed Lachenani, Hamza Kheddar, Mohamed Ouldzmirli
Abstract: This work addresses the need for enhanced accuracy and efficiency in speech command recognition systems, a critical component for improving user interaction in various smart applications. Leveraging the robust pretrained YAMNet model and transfer learning, this study develops a method that significantly improves speech command recognition. We adapt and train a YAMNet deep learning model to effectively detect and interpret speech commands from audio signals. Using the extensively annotated Speech Commands dataset (speech_commands_v0.01), our approach demonstrates the practical application of transfer learning to accurately recognize a predefined set of speech commands. The dataset is meticulously augmented, and features are strategically extracted to boost model performance. As a result, the final model achieved a recognition accuracy of 95.28%, underscoring the impact of advanced machine learning techniques on speech command recognition. This achievement marks substantial progress in audio processing technologies and establishes a new benchmark for future research in the field.

Title: PAD: Phase-Amplitude Decoupling Fusion for Multi-Modal Land Cover Classification
Authors: Huiling Zheng, Xian Zhong, Bin Liu, Yi Xiao, Bihan Wen, Xiaofeng Li
Abstract: The fusion of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) and RGB imagery for land cover classification remains challenging due to modality heterogeneity and the underutilization of spectral complementarity. Existing methods often fail to decouple shared structural features from modality-specific radiometric attributes, leading to feature conflicts and information loss. To address this issue, we propose Phase-Amplitude Decoupling (PAD), a frequency-aware framework that separates phase (modality-shared) and amplitude (modality-specific) components in the Fourier domain. Specifically, PAD consists of two key components: 1) Phase Spectrum Correction (PSC), which aligns cross-modal phase features through convolution-guided scaling to enhance geometric consistency, and 2) Amplitude Spectrum Fusion (ASF), which dynamically integrates high-frequency details and low-frequency structures using frequency-adaptive multilayer perceptrons. This approach leverages SAR's sensitivity to morphological features and RGB's spectral richness. Extensive experiments on WHU-OPT-SAR and DDHR-SK datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art performance. Our work establishes a new paradigm for physics-aware multi-modal fusion in remote sensing. The code will be available at this https URL.

Abstract: Recent advancements in text-to-speech (TTS) models have been driven by the integration of large language models (LLMs), enhancing semantic comprehension and improving speech naturalness. However, existing LLM-based TTS models often lack open-source training code and efficient inference acceleration frameworks, limiting their accessibility and adaptability. Additionally, there is no publicly available TTS model specifically optimized for podcast scenarios, which are in high demand for voice interaction applications. To address these limitations, we introduce Muyan-TTS, an open-source trainable TTS model designed for podcast applications within a $50,000 budget. Our model is pre-trained on over 100,000 hours of podcast audio data, enabling zero-shot TTS synthesis with high-quality voice generation. Furthermore, Muyan-TTS supports speaker adaptation with dozens of minutes of target speech, making it highly customizable for individual voices. In addition to open-sourcing the model, we provide a comprehensive data collection and processing pipeline, a full training procedure, and an optimized inference framework that accelerates LLM-based TTS synthesis. Our code and models are available at this https URL.

Title: A Kinematic and Kinetic Dataset of Lower Limb Joints During Obstacle Crossing in Healthy Adults
Authors: Jingwen Huang, Shucong Yin, Hanyang Xu, Zhaokai Chen, Chenglong Fu
Abstract: Crossing obstacles is a critical component of daily walking, especially for individuals with lower limb amputations, where the challenge and fall risk are heightened. While previous studies have examined obstacle crossing, they lack a systematic analysis of kinematic and kinetic changes in lower limb joints across the entire gait cycle when crossing obstacles of varying heights. This study develops a dataset of healthy individuals crossing obstacles and systematically analyzes the kinematics and kinetics of lower limb joints at different obstacle heights. Ten healthy adults participated in the experiment, crossing obstacles of varying heights (7.5 cm, 15 cm, 22.5 cm, and 30 cm), with biomechanical data including joint angles and torques of the hip, knee, and ankle recorded. As obstacle height increased, the proportion of the swing phase in the gait cycle significantly increased; the hip joint angle increased by approximately 1.5 times, and the knee joint angle increased by about 1.0 times. Both joints also exhibited significant increases in torque. In contrast, minimal changes were observed at the ankle joint, with torque remaining stable. Additionally, noticeable differences in the kinematics and kinetics between the dominant and non-dominant foot were observed, highlighting functional asymmetry. The dominant foot exhibited greater joint angles in the hip and knee joints, and less variation in the ankle joint compared to the non-dominant foot, demonstrating more coordinated movement. This detailed analysis of gait adjustments during obstacle crossing provides valuable insights into biomechanical changes in lower limb joints.

Title: SA-MIMO: Scalable Quantum-Based Wireless Communications
Authors: Jiuyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Rydberg atomic receivers offer a quantum-native alternative to conventional RF front-ends by directly detecting electromagnetic fields via highly excited atomic states. While their quantum-limited sensitivity and hardware simplicity make them promising for future wireless systems, extending their use to scalable multi-antenna and multi-carrier configurations, termed Scalable Atomic-MIMO (SA-MIMO), remains largely unexplored. This paper introduces a novel RF transmitter-atomic receiver architecture that addresses this gap. The core idea lies in a novel modulation technique called Phase-Rotated Symbol Spreading (PRSS), which transforms the nonlinear phase retrieval problem inherent to atomic detection into a tractable linear demultiplexing task. PRSS enables efficient signal processing and supports scalable MUX/DeMUX operations in both atomic MIMO and atomic OFDM systems. Simulation results show that the proposed system achieves up to 2.5 dB gain under optimal maximum-likelihood detection and over 10 dB under suboptimal detection in MIMO settings. These results establish PRSS assisted SA-MIMO as a promising architecture for realizing high-sensitivity, interference-resilient atomic wireless communication.

Authors: Sandipan Dhar, Nanda Dulal Jana, Swagatam Das
Abstract: Voice conversion (VC) stands as a crucial research area in speech synthesis, enabling the transformation of a speaker's vocal characteristics to resemble another while preserving the linguistic content. This technology has broad applications, including automated movie dubbing, speech-to-singing conversion, and assistive devices for pathological speech rehabilitation. With the increasing demand for high-quality and natural-sounding synthetic voices, researchers have developed a wide range of VC techniques. Among these, generative adversarial network (GAN)-based approaches have drawn considerable attention for their powerful feature-mapping capabilities and potential to produce highly realistic speech. Despite notable advancements, challenges such as ensuring training stability, maintaining linguistic consistency, and achieving perceptual naturalness continue to hinder progress in GAN-based VC systems. This systematic review presents a comprehensive analysis of the voice conversion landscape, highlighting key techniques, key challenges, and the transformative impact of GANs in the field. The survey categorizes existing methods, examines technical obstacles, and critically evaluates recent developments in GAN-based VC. By consolidating and synthesizing research findings scattered across the literature, this review provides a structured understanding of the strengths and limitations of different approaches. The significance of this survey lies in its ability to guide future research by identifying existing gaps, proposing potential directions, and offering insights for building more robust and efficient VC systems. Overall, this work serves as an essential resource for researchers, developers, and practitioners aiming to advance the state-of-the-art (SOTA) in voice conversion technology.

Title: Adaptive Dual-domain Learning for Underwater Image Enhancement
Authors: Lingtao Peng, Liheng Bian
Abstract: Recently, learning-based Underwater Image Enhancement (UIE) methods have demonstrated promising performance. However, existing learning-based methods still face two challenges. 1) They rarely consider the inconsistent degradation levels in different spatial regions and spectral bands simultaneously. 2) They treat all regions equally, ignoring that the regions with high-frequency details are more difficult to reconstruct. To address these challenges, we propose a novel UIE method based on spatial-spectral dual-domain adaptive learning, termed SS-UIE. Specifically, we first introduce a spatial-wise Multi-scale Cycle Selective Scan (MCSS) module and a Spectral-Wise Self-Attention (SWSA) module, both with linear complexity, and combine them in parallel to form a basic Spatial-Spectral block (SS-block). Benefiting from the global receptive field of MCSS and SWSA, SS-block can effectively model the degradation levels of different spatial regions and spectral bands, thereby enabling degradation level-based dual-domain adaptive UIE. By stacking multiple SS-blocks, we build our SS-UIE network. Additionally, a Frequency-Wise Loss (FWL) is introduced to narrow the frequency-wise discrepancy and reinforce the model's attention on the regions with high-frequency details. Extensive experiments validate that the SS-UIE technique outperforms state-of-the-art UIE methods while requiring cheaper computational and memory costs.

Title: Robust Nash equilibrium seeking based on semi-Markov switching topologies
Authors: Jianing Chen, Sitian Qin, Chuangyin Dang
Abstract: This paper investigates a distributed robust Nash Equilibrium (NE) seeking problem in fluctuating environments. Specifically, the players, subject to the second-order dynamics, are considered to be influenced by external disturbances and uncertain dynamics while communicating via semi-Markov switching topologies. In such constantly changing network circumstances, the existence of disturbances and uncertain dynamics may directly affect the performance of most existing NE seeking algorithms. Moreover, the semi-Markov switching topologies may cause communication uncertainty, which are considered in NE seeking for the first time. To accommodate the above concerns, the following targets require to be reached simultaneously: (1) Disturbances and uncertain dynamics rejection in finite time; (2) Distributed estimation on unknown information required for players' cost functions; (3) A reasonable estimation consensus protocol under semi-Markov switching; (4) NE seeking for the second-order players. By combining supertwisting-based Integral Sliding-Mode Control (ISMC) with average consensus tracking, a novel robust NE seeking algorithm is constructed, incorporating an effective leader-follower consensus protocol. Furthermore, to lessen dispensable information transmission, a sampled-data-based event-triggered mechanism is introduced. Incorporating the advantages of both semi-Markov switching and event-triggered mechanism, another NE seeking algorithm is proposed. Through designing an appropriate Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, it is shown that the leader-follower consensus can be achieved in the mean-square sense under event-triggered mechanism. Finally, a connectivity control game is formulated to illustrate the validity of the designed algorithms.

Title: Robotic Trail Maker Platform for Rehabilitation in Neurological Conditions: Clinical Use Cases
Authors: Srikar Annamraju, Harris Nisar, Dayu Xia, Shankar A. Deka, Anne Horowitz, Nadica Miljković, Dušan M. Stipanović
Abstract: Patients with neurological conditions require rehabilitation to restore their motor, visual, and cognitive abilities. To meet the shortage of therapists and reduce their workload, a robotic rehabilitation platform involving the clinical trail making test is proposed. Therapists can create custom trails for each patient and the patient can trace the trails using a robotic device. The platform can track the performance of the patient and use these data to provide dynamic assistance through the robot to the patient interface. Therefore, the proposed platform not only functions as an evaluation platform, but also trains the patient in recovery. The developed platform has been validated at a rehabilitation center, with therapists and patients operating the device. It was found that patients performed poorly while using the platform compared to healthy subjects and that the assistance provided also improved performance amongst patients. Statistical analysis demonstrated that the speed of the patients was significantly enhanced with the robotic assistance. Further, neural networks are trained to classify between patients and healthy subjects and to forecast their movements using the data collected.

Title: Efficient COLREGs-Compliant Collision Avoidance using Turning Circle-based Control Barrier Function
Authors: Changyu Lee, Jinwook Park, Jinwhan Kim
Abstract: This paper proposes a computationally efficient collision avoidance algorithm using turning circle-based control barrier functions (CBFs) that comply with international regulations for preventing collisions at sea (COLREGs). Conventional CBFs often lack explicit consideration of turning capabilities and avoidance direction, which are key elements in developing a COLREGs-compliant collision avoidance algorithm. To overcome these limitations, we introduce two CBFs derived from left and right turning circles. These functions establish safety conditions based on the proximity between the traffic ships and the centers of the turning circles, effectively determining both avoidance directions and turning capabilities. The proposed method formulates a quadratic programming problem with the CBFs as constraints, ensuring safe navigation without relying on computationally intensive trajectory optimization. This approach significantly reduces computational effort while maintaining performance comparable to model predictive control-based methods. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm in enabling COLREGs-compliant, safe navigation, demonstrating its potential for reliable and efficient operation in complex maritime environments.

Title: Unscented Particle Filter for Visual-inertial Navigation using IMU and Landmark Measurements
Authors: Khashayar Ghanizadegan, Hashim A. Hashim
Abstract: This paper introduces a geometric Quaternion-based Unscented Particle Filter for Visual-Inertial Navigation (QUPF-VIN) specifically designed for a vehicle operating with six degrees of freedom (6 DoF). The proposed QUPF-VIN technique is quaternion-based capturing the inherently nonlinear nature of true navigation kinematics. The filter fuses data from a low-cost inertial measurement unit (IMU) and landmark observations obtained via a vision sensor. The QUPF-VIN is implemented in discrete form to ensure seamless integration with onboard inertial sensing systems. Designed for robustness in GPS-denied environments, the proposed method has been validated through experiments with real-world dataset involving an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) equipped with a 6-axis IMU and a stereo camera, operating with 6 DoF. The numerical results demonstrate that the QUPF-VIN provides superior tracking accuracy compared to ground truth data. Additionally, a comparative analysis with a standard Kalman filter-based navigation technique further highlights the enhanced performance of the QUPF-VIN.

Title: Synthesis of Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions for Polynomial Systems Based on Sum-of-Squares Programming
Authors: Erfan Shakhesi, W.P.M.H. (Maurice)Heemels, Alexander Katriniok
Abstract: Discrete-time Control Barrier Functions (DTCBFs) are commonly utilized in the literature as a powerful tool for synthesizing control policies that guarantee safety of discrete-time dynamical systems. However, the systematic synthesis of DTCBFs in a computationally efficient way is at present an important open problem. This article first proposes a novel alternating-descent approach based on Sum-of-Squares programming to synthesize quadratic DTCBFs and corresponding polynomial control policies for discrete-time control-affine polynomial systems with input constraints and semi-algebraic safe sets. Subsequently, two distinct approaches are introduced to extend the proposed method to the synthesis of higher-degree polynomial DTCBFs. To demonstrate its efficacy, we apply the proposed method to numerical case studies.

Title: $O(1/k)$ Finite-Time Bound for Non-Linear Two-Time-Scale Stochastic Approximation
Authors: Siddharth Chandak
Abstract: Two-time-scale stochastic approximation is an algorithm with coupled iterations which has found broad applications in reinforcement learning, optimization and game control. While several prior works have obtained a mean square error bound of $O(1/k)$ for linear two-time-scale iterations, the best known bound in the non-linear contractive setting has been $O(1/k^{2/3})$. In this work, we obtain an improved bound of $O(1/k)$ for non-linear two-time-scale stochastic approximation. Our result applies to algorithms such as gradient descent-ascent and two-time-scale Lagrangian optimization. The key step in our analysis involves rewriting the original iteration in terms of an averaged noise sequence which decays sufficiently fast. Additionally, we use an induction-based approach to show that the iterates are bounded in expectation.

Title: HyperController: A Hyperparameter Controller for Fast and Stable Training of Reinforcement Learning Neural Networks
Authors: Jonathan Gornet, Yiannis Kantaros, Bruno Sinopoli
Abstract: We introduce Hyperparameter Controller (HyperController), a computationally efficient algorithm for hyperparameter optimization during training of reinforcement learning neural networks. HyperController optimizes hyperparameters quickly while also maintaining improvement of the reinforcement learning neural network, resulting in faster training and deployment. It achieves this by modeling the hyperparameter optimization problem as an unknown Linear Gaussian Dynamical System, which is a system with a state that linearly changes. It then learns an efficient representation of the hyperparameter objective function using the Kalman filter, which is the optimal one-step predictor for a Linear Gaussian Dynamical System. To demonstrate the performance of HyperController, it is applied as a hyperparameter optimizer during training of reinforcement learning neural networks on a variety of OpenAI Gymnasium environments. In four out of the five Gymnasium environments, HyperController achieves highest median reward during evaluation compared to other algorithms. The results exhibit the potential of HyperController for efficient and stable training of reinforcement learning neural networks.

Title: Innovative Integration of 4D Cardiovascular Reconstruction and Hologram: A New Visualization Tool for Coronary Artery Bypass Grafting Planning
Authors: Shuo Wang, Tong Ren, Nan Cheng, Li Zhang, Rong Wang
Abstract: Background: Coronary artery bypass grafting (CABG) planning requires advanced spatial visualization and consideration of coronary artery depth, calcification, and pericardial adhesions. Objective: To develop and evaluate a dynamic cardiovascular holographic visualization tool for preoperative CABG planning. Methods: Using 4D cardiac computed tomography angiography data from 14 CABG candidates, we developed a semi-automated workflow for time-resolved segmentation of cardiac structures, epicardial adipose tissue (EAT), and coronary arteries with calcium scoring. The workflow incorporated methods for cardiac segmentation, coronary calcification quantification, visualization of coronary depth within EAT, and pericardial adhesion assessment through motion analysis. Dynamic cardiovascular holograms were displayed using the Looking Glass platform. Thirteen cardiac surgeons evaluated the tool using a Likert scale. Additionally, pericardial adhesion scores from holograms of 21 patients (including seven undergoing secondary cardiac surgeries) were compared with intraoperative findings. Results: Surgeons rated the visualization tool highly for preoperative planning utility (mean Likert score: 4.57/5.0). Hologram-based pericardial adhesion scoring strongly correlated with intraoperative findings (r=0.786, P<0.001). Conclusion: This study establishes a visualization framework for CABG planning that produces clinically relevant dynamic holograms from patient-specific data, with clinical feedback confirming its effectiveness for preoperative planning.

Title: UNet with Axial Transformer : A Neural Weather Model for Precipitation Nowcasting
Authors: Maitreya Sonawane, Sumit Mamtani
Abstract: Making accurate weather predictions can be particularly challenging for localized storms or events that evolve on hourly timescales, such as thunderstorms. Hence, our goal for the project was to model Weather Nowcasting for making highly localized and accurate predictions that apply to the immediate future replacing the current numerical weather models and data assimilation systems with Deep Learning approaches. A significant advantage of machine learning is that inference is computationally cheap given an already-trained model, allowing forecasts that are nearly instantaneous and in the native high resolution of the input data. In this work we developed a novel method that employs Transformer-based machine learning models to forecast precipitation. This approach works by leveraging axial attention mechanisms to learn complex patterns and dynamics from time series frames. Moreover, it is a generic framework and can be applied to univariate and multivariate time series data, as well as time series embeddings data. This paper represents an initial research on the dataset used in the domain of next frame prediciton, and hence, we demonstrate state-of-the-art results in terms of metrices (PSNR = 47.67, SSIM = 0.9943) used for the given dataset using UNet with Axial Transformer.

Authors: Ashwin P. Dani
Abstract: In this paper, a constrained parameter update law is derived in the context of adaptive control. The parameter update law is based on constrained optimization technique where a Lagrangian is formulated to incorporate the constraints on the parameters using inverse Barrier function. The constrained parameter update law is used to develop a adaptive tracking controller and the overall stability of the adaptive controller along with the constrained parameter update law is shown using Lyapunov analysis and development in stability of constrained primal-dual dynamics. The performance of the constrained parameter update law is tested in simulation for keeping the parameters within constraints and convergence to true parameters.

Title: Age of Information Analysis for NOMA-Assisted Grant-Free Transmissions with Randomly Arrived Packets
Authors: Yanshi Sun, Yanglin Ye, Caihong Kai, Zhiguo Ding, Bin Chen
Abstract: This paper investigates the application of non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) to grant-free transmissions to reduce the age of information (AoI) in uplink status update systems, where multiple sources upload their {status updates} to {a common} receiver. Unlike existing studies which {adopted} the idealized generate-at-will (GAW) model, {i.e., a status} update data can be generated and transmitted at any time, this paper utilizes a more practical model {to characterize} the inherent randomness of the generation of the status updating data packets. A rigorous analytical framework is established to precisely evaluate the average AoI achieved by the NOMA-assisted grant-free schemes for both {the} cases with and without retransmission. The impact of the choice of the probability {of transmission} on the average AoI is investigated. Extensive simulation results are provided to validate the accuracy of the developed analysis. It is shown that NOMA-assisted schemes are more superior in reducing AoI{, compared} to orthogonal multiple access (OMA) based schemes. In addition, compared to schemes without retransmission, the AoI performance {of} the schemes with retransmission can {be improved} significantly when the status update generation rate is low or the user density is relatively high.

Title: Graph Reinforcement Learning for QoS-Aware Load Balancing in Open Radio Access Networks
Authors: Omid Semiari, Hosein Nikopour, Shilpa Talwar
Abstract: Next-generation wireless cellular networks are expected to provide unparalleled Quality-of-Service (QoS) for emerging wireless applications, necessitating strict performance guarantees, e.g., in terms of link-level data rates. A critical challenge in meeting these QoS requirements is the prevention of cell congestion, which involves balancing the load to ensure sufficient radio resources are available for each cell to serve its designated User Equipments (UEs). In this work, a novel QoS-aware Load Balancing (LB) approach is developed to optimize the performance of Guaranteed Bit Rate (GBR) and Best Effort (BE) traffic in a multi-band Open Radio Access Network (O-RAN) under QoS and resource constraints. The proposed solution builds on Graph Reinforcement Learning (GRL), a powerful framework at the intersection of Graph Neural Network (GNN) and RL. The QoS-aware LB is modeled as a Markov Decision Process, with states represented as graphs. QoS consideration are integrated into both state representations and reward signal design. The LB agent is then trained using an off-policy dueling Deep Q Network (DQN) that leverages a GNN-based architecture. This design ensures the LB policy is invariant to the ordering of nodes (UE or cell), flexible in handling various network sizes, and capable of accounting for spatial node dependencies in LB decisions. Performance of the GRL-based solution is compared with two baseline methods. Results show substantial performance gains, including a $53\%$ reduction in QoS violations and a fourfold increase in the 5th percentile rate for BE traffic.

Title: Sliding motions on systems with non-Euclidean state spaces: A differential-geometric perspective
Authors: Fernando Castaños
Abstract: This paper extends sliding-mode control theory to nonlinear systems evolving on smooth manifolds. Building on differential geometric methods, we reformulate Filippov's notion of solutions, characterize well-defined vector fields on quotient spaces, and provide a consistent geometric definition of higher-order sliding modes. We generalize the regular form to non-Euclidean settings and design explicit first- and second-order sliding-mode controllers that respect the manifold structure. Particular attention is given to the role of topological obstructions, which are illustrated through examples on the cylinder, Möbius bundle, and 2-sphere. Our results highlight how geometric and topological properties fundamentally influence sliding dynamics and suggest new directions for robust control in nonlinear spaces.

Title: Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion via Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent
Authors: Yicheng Li, Xinghua Sun
Abstract: This paper proposes and analyzes a gradient-type algorithm based on Burer-Monteiro factorization, called the Asymmetric Projected Gradient Descent (APGD), for reconstructing the point set configuration from partial Euclidean distance measurements, known as the Euclidean Distance Matrix Completion (EDMC) problem. By paralleling the incoherence matrix completion framework, we show for the first time that global convergence guarantee with exact recovery of this routine can be established given $\mathcal{O}(\mu^2 r^3 \kappa^2 n \log n)$ Bernoulli random observations without any sample splitting. Unlike leveraging the tangent space Restricted Isometry Property (RIP) and local curvature of the low-rank embedding manifold in some very recent works, our proof provides new upper bounds to replace the random graph lemma under EDMC setting. The APGD works surprisingly well and numerical experiments demonstrate exact linear convergence behavior in rich-sample regions yet deteriorates fast when compared with the performance obtained by optimizing the s-stress function, i.e., the standard but unexplained non-convex approach for EDMC, if the sample size is limited. While virtually matching our theoretical prediction, this unusual phenomenon might indicate that: (i) the power of implicit regularization is weakened when specified in the APGD case; (ii) the stabilization of such new gradient direction requires substantially more samples than the information-theoretic limit would suggest.

Title: Magnifier: A Multi-grained Neural Network-based Architecture for Burned Area Delineation
Authors: Daniele Rege Cambrin, Luca Colomba, Paolo Garza
Abstract: In crisis management and remote sensing, image segmentation plays a crucial role, enabling tasks like disaster response and emergency planning by analyzing visual data. Neural networks are able to analyze satellite acquisitions and determine which areas were affected by a catastrophic event. The problem in their development in this context is the data scarcity and the lack of extensive benchmark datasets, limiting the capabilities of training large neural network models. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology, namely Magnifier, to improve segmentation performance with limited data availability. The Magnifier methodology is applicable to any existing encoder-decoder architecture, as it extends a model by merging information at different contextual levels through a dual-encoder approach: a local and global encoder. Magnifier analyzes the input data twice using the dual-encoder approach. In particular, the local and global encoders extract information from the same input at different granularities. This allows Magnifier to extract more information than the other approaches given the same set of input images. Magnifier improves the quality of the results of +2.65% on average IoU while leading to a restrained increase in terms of the number of trainable parameters compared to the original model. We evaluated our proposed approach with state-of-the-art burned area segmentation models, demonstrating, on average, comparable or better performances in less than half of the GFLOPs.

Title: AI Alignment in Medical Imaging: Unveiling Hidden Biases Through Counterfactual Analysis
Authors: Haroui Ma, Francesco Quinzan, Theresa Willem, Stefan Bauer
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) systems for medical imaging have demonstrated remarkable diagnostic capabilities, but their susceptibility to biases poses significant risks, since biases may negatively impact generalization performance. In this paper, we introduce a novel statistical framework to evaluate the dependency of medical imaging ML models on sensitive attributes, such as demographics. Our method leverages the concept of counterfactual invariance, measuring the extent to which a model's predictions remain unchanged under hypothetical changes to sensitive attributes. We present a practical algorithm that combines conditional latent diffusion models with statistical hypothesis testing to identify and quantify such biases without requiring direct access to counterfactual data. Through experiments on synthetic datasets and large-scale real-world medical imaging datasets, including \textsc{cheXpert} and MIMIC-CXR, we demonstrate that our approach aligns closely with counterfactual fairness principles and outperforms standard baselines. This work provides a robust tool to ensure that ML diagnostic systems generalize well, e.g., across demographic groups, offering a critical step towards AI safety in healthcare.

Title: A Unified Benchmark of Federated Learning with Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks for Medical Imaging
Authors: Youngjoon Lee, Jinu Gong, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: Federated Learning (FL) enables model training across decentralized devices without sharing raw data, thereby preserving privacy in sensitive domains like healthcare. In this paper, we evaluate Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KAN) architectures against traditional MLP across six state-of-the-art FL algorithms on a blood cell classification dataset. Notably, our experiments demonstrate that KAN can effectively replace MLP in federated environments, achieving superior performance with simpler architectures. Furthermore, we analyze the impact of key hyperparameters-grid size and network architecture-on KAN performance under varying degrees of Non-IID data distribution. Additionally, our ablation studies reveal that optimizing KAN width while maintaining minimal depth yields the best performance in federated settings. As a result, these findings establish KAN as a promising alternative for privacy-preserving medical imaging applications in distributed healthcare. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first comprehensive benchmark of KAN in FL settings for medical imaging task.

Abstract: Mixture of Experts (MoE) has emerged as a promising paradigm for scaling model capacity while preserving computational efficiency, particularly in large-scale machine learning architectures such as large language models (LLMs). Recent advances in MoE have facilitated its adoption in wireless networks to address the increasing complexity and heterogeneity of modern communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive survey of the MoE framework in wireless networks, highlighting its potential in optimizing resource efficiency, improving scalability, and enhancing adaptability across diverse network tasks. We first introduce the fundamental concepts of MoE, including various gating mechanisms and the integration with generative AI (GenAI) and reinforcement learning (RL). Subsequently, we discuss the extensive applications of MoE across critical wireless communication scenarios, such as vehicular networks, unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellite communications, heterogeneous networks, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), and mobile edge networks. Furthermore, key applications in channel prediction, physical layer signal processing, radio resource management, network optimization, and security are thoroughly examined. Additionally, we present a detailed overview of open-source datasets that are widely used in MoE-based models to support diverse machine learning tasks. Finally, this survey identifies crucial future research directions for MoE, emphasizing the importance of advanced training techniques, resource-aware gating strategies, and deeper integration with emerging 6G technologies.

Title: Modified Control Barrier Function for Quadratic Program Based Control Design via Sum-of-Squares Programming
Authors: Yankai Lin, Michelle S. Chong, Carlos Murguia
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control affine system controlled by inputs generated by a quadratic program (QP) induced by a control barrier functions (CBF). Specifically, we slightly modify the condition satisfied by CBFs and study how the modification can positively impact the closed loop behavior of the system. We show that, QP-based controllers designed using the modified CBF condition preserves the desired properties of QP-based controllers using standard CBF conditions. Furthermore, using the generalized S-procedure for polynomial functions, we formulate the design of the modified CBFs as a Sum-Of-Squares (SOS) program, which can be solved efficiently. Via a numerical example, the proposed CBF design is shown to have superior performance over the standard CBF widely used in existing literature.

Title: Automated Generation of Precedence Graphs in Digital Value Chains for Automotive Production
Authors: Cornelius Hake, Christian Friedrich
Abstract: This study examines the digital value chain in automotive manufacturing, focusing on the identification, software flashing, customization, and commissioning of electronic control units in vehicle networks. A novel precedence graph design is proposed to optimize this process chain using an automated scheduling algorithm that employs mixed integer linear programming techniques. The results show significant improvements in key metrics. The algorithm reduces the number of production stations equipped with expensive hardware and software to execute digital value chain processes, while increasing capacity utilization through efficient scheduling and reduced idle time. Task parallelization is optimized, resulting in streamlined workflows and increased throughput. Compared to the traditional method, the automated approach has reduced preparation time by 50% and reduced scheduling activities, as it now takes two minutes to create the precedence graph. The flexibility of the algorithm's constraints allows for vehicle-specific configurations while maintaining high responsiveness, eliminating backup stations and facilitating the integration of new topologies. Automated scheduling significantly outperforms manual methods in efficiency, functionality, and adaptability.

Title: Feelbert: A Feedback Linearization-based Embedded Real-Time Quadrupedal Locomotion Framework
Authors: Aristide Emanuele Casucci, Federico Nesti, Mauro Marinoni, Giorgio Buttazzo
Abstract: Quadruped robots have become quite popular for their ability to adapt their locomotion to generic uneven terrains. For this reason, over time, several frameworks for quadrupedal locomotion have been proposed, but with little attention to ensuring a predictable timing behavior of the controller. To address this issue, this work presents \NAME, a modular control framework for quadrupedal locomotion suitable for execution on an embedded system under hard real-time execution constraints. It leverages the feedback linearization control technique to obtain a closed-form control law for the body, valid for all configurations of the robot. The control law was derived after defining an appropriate rigid body model that uses the accelerations of the feet as control variables, instead of the estimated contact forces. This work also provides a novel algorithm to compute footholds and gait temporal parameters using the concept of imaginary wheels, and a heuristic algorithm to select the best gait schedule for the current velocity commands. The proposed framework is developed entirely in C++, with no dependencies on third-party libraries and no dynamic memory allocation, to ensure predictability and real-time performance. Its implementation allows \NAME\ to be both compiled and executed on an embedded system for critical applications, as well as integrated into larger systems such as Robot Operating System 2 (ROS 2). For this reason, \NAME\ has been tested in both scenarios, demonstrating satisfactory results both in terms of reference tracking and temporal predictability, whether integrated into ROS 2 or compiled as a standalone application on a Raspberry Pi 5.

Title: Optimal Acceptance of Incompatible Kidneys
Authors: Xingyu Ren, Michael C. Fu, Steven I. Marcus
Abstract: Incompatibility between patient and donor is a major barrier in kidney transplantation (KT). The increasing shortage of kidney donors has driven the development of desensitization techniques to overcome this immunological challenge. Compared with compatible KT, patients undergoing incompatible KTs are more likely to experience rejection, infection, malignancy, and graft loss. We study the optimal acceptance of possibly incompatible kidneys for individual end-stage kidney disease patients. To capture the effect of incompatibility, we propose a Markov Decision Process (MDP) model that explicitly includes compatibility as a state variable. The resulting higher-dimensional model makes it more challenging to analyze, but under suitable conditions, we derive structural properties including control limit-type optimal policies that are easy to compute and implement. Numerical examples illustrate the behavior of the optimal policy under different mismatch levels and highlight the importance of explicitly incorporating the incompatibility level into the acceptance decision when desensitization therapy is an option.

Title: Mitigating Evasion Attacks in Federated Learning-Based Signal Classifiers
Authors: Su Wang, Rajeev Sahay, Adam Piaseczny, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: Recent interest in leveraging federated learning (FL) for radio signal classification (SC) tasks has shown promise but FL-based SC remains susceptible to model poisoning adversarial attacks. These adversarial attacks mislead the ML model training process, damaging ML models across the network and leading to lower SC performance. In this work, we seek to mitigate model poisoning adversarial attacks on FL-based SC by proposing the Underlying Server Defense of Federated Learning (USD-FL). Unlike existing server-driven defenses, USD-FL does not rely on perfect network information, i.e., knowing the quantity of adversaries, the adversarial attack architecture, or the start time of the adversarial attacks. Our proposed USD-FL methodology consists of deriving logits for devices' ML models on a reserve dataset, comparing pair-wise logits via 1-Wasserstein distance and then determining a time-varying threshold for adversarial detection. As a result, USD-FL effectively mitigates model poisoning attacks introduced in the FL network. Specifically, when baseline server-driven defenses do have perfect network information, USD-FL outperforms them by (i) improving final ML classification accuracies by at least 6%, (ii) reducing false positive adversary detection rates by at least 10%, and (iii) decreasing the total number of misclassified signals by over 8%. Moreover, when baseline defenses do not have perfect network information, we show that USD-FL achieves accuracies of approximately 74.1% and 62.5% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, outperforming existing server-driven baselines, which achieve 52.1% and 39.2% in i.i.d. and non-i.i.d. settings, respectively.

Title: An $\ell^1$-Plug-and-Play Approach for MPI Using a Zero Shot Denoiser with Evaluation on the 3D Open MPI Dataset
Authors: Vladyslav Gapyak, Corinna Rentschler, Thomas März, Andreas Weinmann
Abstract: Objective: Magnetic particle imaging (MPI) is an emerging medical imaging modality which has gained increasing interest in recent years. Among the benefits of MPI are its high temporal resolution, and that the technique does not expose the specimen to any kind of ionizing radiation. It is based on the non-linear response of magnetic nanoparticles to an applied magnetic field. From the electric signal measured in receive coils, the particle concentration has to be reconstructed. Due to the ill-posedness of the reconstruction problem, various regularization methods have been proposed for reconstruction ranging from early stopping methods, via classical Tikhonov regularization and iterative methods to modern machine learning approaches. In this work, we contribute to the latter class: we propose a plug-and-play approach based on a generic zero-shot denoiser with an $\ell^1$-prior. Approach: We validate the reconstruction parameters of the method on a hybrid dataset and compare it with the baseline Tikhonov, DIP and the previous PP-MPI, which is a plug-and-play method with denoiser trained on MPI-friendly data. Main results: We offer a quantitative and qualitative evaluation of the zero-shot plug-and-play approach on the 3D Open MPI dataset. Moreover, we show the quality of the approach with different levels of preprocessing of the data. Significance: The proposed method employs a zero-shot denoiser which has not been trained for the MPI task and therefore saves the cost for training. Moreover, it offers a method that can be potentially applied in future MPI contexts.

Title: A Weight-aware-based Multi-source Unsupervised Domain Adaptation Method for Human Motion Intention Recognition
Authors: Xiao-Yin Liu, Guotao Li, Xiao-Hu Zhou, Xu Liang, Zeng-Guang Hou
Abstract: Accurate recognition of human motion intention (HMI) is beneficial for exoskeleton robots to improve the wearing comfort level and achieve natural human-robot interaction. A classifier trained on labeled source subjects (domains) performs poorly on unlabeled target subject since the difference in individual motor characteristics. The unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) method has become an effective way to this problem. However, the labeled data are collected from multiple source subjects that might be different not only from the target subject but also from each other. The current UDA methods for HMI recognition ignore the difference between each source subject, which reduces the classification accuracy. Therefore, this paper considers the differences between source subjects and develops a novel theory and algorithm for UDA to recognize HMI, where the margin disparity discrepancy (MDD) is extended to multi-source UDA theory and a novel weight-aware-based multi-source UDA algorithm (WMDD) is proposed. The source domain weight, which can be adjusted adaptively by the MDD between each source subject and target subject, is incorporated into UDA to measure the differences between source subjects. The developed multi-source UDA theory is theoretical and the generalization error on target subject is guaranteed. The theory can be transformed into an optimization problem for UDA, successfully bridging the gap between theory and algorithm. Moreover, a lightweight network is employed to guarantee the real-time of classification and the adversarial learning between feature generator and ensemble classifiers is utilized to further improve the generalization ability. The extensive experiments verify theoretical analysis and show that WMDD outperforms previous UDA methods on HMI recognition tasks.

Title: Instantaneous Bandwidth Estimation from Level-Crossing Samples via LSTM-based Encoder-Decoder Architecture
Authors: Johannes Königs, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: This paper presents an approach for instantaneous bandwidth estimation from level-crossing (LC) samples using a long short-term memory (LSTM) encoder-decoder architecture. LC sampling is a nonuniform sampling technique that is particularly useful for energy-efficient acquisition of signals with sparse spectra. Especially in combination with fully analog wireless sensor nodes, LC sampling offers a viable alternative to traditional sampling methods. However, due to the nonuniform distribution of samples, reconstructing the original signal is a challenging task. One promising reconstruction approach is time-warping, where the local signal spectrum is taken into account. However, this requires an accurate estimate of the instantaneous bandwidth of the signal. In this paper, we show that applying a neural network to the problem of estimating instantaneous bandwidth from LC samples can improve the overall reconstruction accuracy. We conduct a comprehensive numerical analysis of the proposed approach and compare it to an intensity-based bandwidth estimation method from literature.

Title: Leader-Follower Density Control of Spatial Dynamics in Large-Scale Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Gian Carlo Maffettone, Alain Boldini, Maurizio Porfiri, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: We address the problem of controlling the density of a large ensemble of follower agents by acting on a group of leader agents that interact with them. Using coupled partial integro-differential equations to describe leader and follower density dynamics, we establish feasibility conditions and develop two control architectures ensuring global stability. The first employs feed-forward control on the followers' and a feedback on the leaders' density. The second implements a dual feedback loop through a reference-governor that adapts the leaders' density based on both populations' measurements. Our methods, initially developed in a one-dimensional setting, are extended to multi-dimensional cases, and validated through numerical simulations for representative control applications, both for groups of infinite and finite size.

The presented results will provide novel tools to design CBFs inducing desired energetic behaviors of the closed-loop system, including nontrivial damping injection effects and non-passive control actions, effectively injecting energy in the system in a controlled manner. Simulations validate the stated results.

Title: A Novel Massive Random Access in Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems for High-Speed Mobility with OTFS Modulation
Authors: Yanfeng Hu, Dongming Wang, Xinjiang Xia, Jiamin Li, Pengcheng Zhu, Xiaohu You
Abstract: In the research of next-generation wireless communication technologies, orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation is emerging as a promising technique for high-speed mobile environments due to its superior efficiency and robustness in doubly selective channels. Additionally, the cell-free architecture, which eliminates the issues associated with cell boundaries, offers broader coverage for radio access networks. By combining cell-free network architecture with OTFS modulation, the system may meet the demands of massive random access required by machine-type communication devices in high-speed scenarios. This paper explores a massive random access scheme based on OTFS modulation within a cell-free architecture. A transceiver model for uplink OTFS signals involving multiple access points (APs) is developed, where channel estimation with fractional channel parameters is approximated as a block sparse matrix recovery problem. Building on existing superimposed and embedded preamble schemes, a hybrid preamble scheme is proposed. This scheme leverages superimposed and embedded preambles to respectively achieve rough and accurate active user equipment (UEs) detection (AUD), as well as precise channel estimation, under the condition of supporting a large number of access UEs. Moreover, this study introduces a generalized approximate message passing and pattern coupling sparse Bayesian learning with Laplacian prior (GAMP-PCSBL-La) algorithm, which effectively captures block sparse features after discrete cosine transform (DCT), delivering precise estimation results with reduced computational complexity. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed scheme is effective and provides superior performance compared to other existing schemes.

Title: Informative Input Design for Dynamic Mode Decomposition
Authors: Joshua Ott, Mykel J. Kochenderfer, Stephen Boyd
Abstract: Efficiently estimating system dynamics from data is essential for minimizing data collection costs and improving model performance. This work addresses the challenge of designing future control inputs to maximize information gain, thereby improving the efficiency of the system identification process. We propose an approach that integrates informative input design into the Dynamic Mode Decomposition with control (DMDc) framework, which is well-suited for high-dimensional systems. By formulating an approximate convex optimization problem that minimizes the trace of the estimation error covariance matrix, we are able to efficiently reduce uncertainty in the model parameters while respecting constraints on the system states and control inputs. This method outperforms traditional techniques like Pseudo-Random Binary Sequences (PRBS) and orthogonal multisines, which do not adapt to the current system model and often gather redundant information. We validate our approach using aircraft and fluid dynamics simulations to demonstrate the practical applicability and effectiveness of our method. Our results show that strategically planning control inputs based on the current model enhances the accuracy of system identification while requiring less data. Furthermore, we provide our implementation and simulation interfaces as an open-source software package, facilitating further research development and use by industry practitioners.

Title: Devil is in Details: Locality-Aware 3D Abdominal CT Volume Generation for Self-Supervised Organ Segmentation
Authors: Yuran Wang, Zhijing Wan, Yansheng Qiu, Zheng Wang
Abstract: In the realm of medical image analysis, self-supervised learning (SSL) techniques have emerged to alleviate labeling demands, while still facing the challenge of training data scarcity owing to escalating resource requirements and privacy constraints. Numerous efforts employ generative models to generate high-fidelity, unlabeled 3D volumes across diverse modalities and anatomical regions. However, the intricate and indistinguishable anatomical structures within the abdomen pose a unique challenge to abdominal CT volume generation compared to other anatomical regions. To address the overlooked challenge, we introduce the Locality-Aware Diffusion (Lad), a novel method tailored for exquisite 3D abdominal CT volume generation. We design a locality loss to refine crucial anatomical regions and devise a condition extractor to integrate abdominal priori into generation, thereby enabling the generation of large quantities of high-quality abdominal CT volumes essential for SSL tasks without the need for additional data such as labels or radiology reports. Volumes generated through our method demonstrate remarkable fidelity in reproducing abdominal structures, achieving a decrease in FID score from 0.0034 to 0.0002 on AbdomenCT-1K dataset, closely mirroring authentic data and surpassing current methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method in self-supervised organ segmentation tasks, resulting in an improvement in mean Dice scores on two abdominal datasets effectively. These results underscore the potential of synthetic data to advance self-supervised learning in medical image analysis.

Title: Ultra-Wideband Communications: A New Spectrum Survey and Challenges Ahead
Authors: Brian Nelson, Hussein Moradi, Behrouz Farhang-Boroujeny
Abstract: The idea of ultra-wideband (UWB) communications for short ranges (up to a few tens of meters) has been around for nearly three decades. However, despite significant efforts by the industry, UWB deployment has not yet reached its predicted potential. This article, thus, seeks to rectify this situation by providing a practical examination of UWB interference conditions. Through a spectrum survey of today's wireless environments, we quantify the level of interference that UWB devices may face and explore the signal processing steps that must be taken to materialize the full potential of UWB communications.

Title: Learning Modality-Aware Representations: Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network for Multimodal MRI Synthesis
Authors: Tao Song, Yicheng Wu, Minhao Hu, Xiangde Luo, Linda Wei, Guotai Wang, Yi Guo, Feng Xu, Shaoting Zhang
Abstract: Multimodal MR image synthesis aims to generate missing modality images by effectively fusing and mapping from a subset of available MRI modalities. Most existing methods adopt an image-to-image translation paradigm, treating multiple modalities as input channels. However, these approaches often yield sub-optimal results due to the inherent difficulty in achieving precise feature- or semantic-level alignment across modalities. To address these challenges, we propose an Adaptive Group-wise Interaction Network (AGI-Net) that explicitly models both inter-modality and intra-modality relationships for multimodal MR image synthesis. Specifically, feature channels are first partitioned into predefined groups, after which an adaptive rolling mechanism is applied to conventional convolutional kernels to better capture feature and semantic correspondences between different modalities. In parallel, a cross-group attention module is introduced to enable effective feature fusion across groups, thereby enhancing the network's representational capacity. We validate the proposed AGI-Net on the publicly available IXI and BraTS2023 datasets. Experimental results demonstrate that AGI-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance in multimodal MR image synthesis tasks, confirming the effectiveness of its modality-aware interaction design. We release the relevant code at: this https URL.

Title: TS3-Codec: Transformer-Based Simple Streaming Single Codec
Authors: Haibin Wu, Naoyuki Kanda, Sefik Emre Eskimez, Jinyu Li
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs) have garnered significant attention as key technologies for audio compression as well as audio representation for speech language models. While mainstream NAC models are predominantly convolution-based, the performance of NACs with a purely transformer-based, and convolution-free architecture remains unexplored. This paper introduces TS3-Codec, a Transformer-Based Simple Streaming Single Codec. TS3-Codec consists of only a stack of transformer layers with a few linear layers, offering greater simplicity and expressiveness by fully eliminating convolution layers that require careful hyperparameter tuning and large computations. Under the streaming setup, the proposed TS3-Codec achieves comparable or superior performance compared to the codec with state-of-the-art convolution-based architecture while requiring only 12% of the computation and 77% of bitrate. Furthermore, it significantly outperforms the convolution-based codec when using similar computational resources.

Title: Uncovering Process Noise in LTV Systems via Kernel Deconvolution
Authors: Jindrich Dunik, Oliver Kost, J. Krejci, Ondrej Straka
Abstract: This paper focuses on the identification of the process noise density of a linear time-varying system described by the state-space model with the known measurement noise density. A novel method is proposed that enhances the measurement difference method (MDM). The proposed method relies on a refined calculation of the MDM residue, which accounts for both process and measurement noises, as well as constructing the kernel density of the residue sample. The process noise density is then estimated by the density deconvolution algorithm utilising the Fourier transform. The method is supplemented with automatic selection of the deconvolution parameters based on the method of moments. The performance of process noise density estimation is evaluated in numerical examples and the paper is supplemented with a MATLAB implementation.

Title: Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge for Accelerated MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Tao Song, Yicheng Wu, Minhao Hu, Xiangde Luo, Guoting Luo, Guotai Wang, Yi Guo, Feng Xu, Shaoting Zhang
Abstract: Accelerated MRI reconstruction plays a vital role in reducing scan time while preserving image quality. While most existing methods rely on complex-valued image-space or k-space data, these formats are often inaccessible in clinical practice due to proprietary reconstruction pipelines, leaving only magnitude images stored in DICOM files. To address this gap, we focus on the underexplored task of magnitude-image-based MRI reconstruction. Recent advancements in diffusion models, particularly denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPMs), have demonstrated strong capabilities in modeling image priors. However, their task-agnostic denoising nature limits performance in source-to-target image translation tasks, such as MRI reconstruction. In this work, we propose a novel Self-Consistent Nested Diffusion Bridge (SC-NDB) framework that models accelerated MRI reconstruction as a bi-directional image translation process between under-sampled and fully-sampled magnitude MRI images. SC-NDB introduces a nested diffusion architecture with a self-consistency constraint and reverse bridge diffusion pathways to improve intermediate prediction fidelity and better capture the explicit priors of source images. Furthermore, we incorporate a Contour Decomposition Embedding Module (CDEM) to inject structural and textural knowledge by leveraging Laplacian pyramids and directional filter banks. Extensive experiments on the fastMRI and IXI datasets demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance compared to both magnitude-based and non-magnitude-based diffusion models, confirming the effectiveness and clinical relevance of SC-NDB.

Title: Temporal Logic Control for Nonlinear Stochastic Systems Under Unknown Disturbances
Authors: Ibon Gracia, Luca Laurenti, Manuel Mazo Jr., Alessandro Abate, Morteza Lahijanian
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel framework to synthesize robust strategies for discrete-time nonlinear systems with random disturbances that are unknown, against temporal logic specifications. The proposed framework is data-driven and abstraction-based: leveraging observations of the system, our approach learns a high-confidence abstraction of the system in the form of an uncertain Markov decision process (UMDP). The uncertainty in the resulting UMDP is used to formally account for both the error in abstracting the system and for the uncertainty coming from the data. Critically, we show that for any given state-action pair in the resulting UMDP, the uncertainty in the transition probabilities can be represented as a convex polytope obtained by a two-layer state discretization and concentration inequalities. This allows us to obtain tighter uncertainty estimates compared to existing approaches, and guarantees efficiency, as we tailor a synthesis algorithm exploiting the structure of this UMDP. We empirically validate our approach on several case studies, showing substantially improved performance compared to the state-of-the-art.

Title: Improving Acoustic Scene Classification in Low-Resource Conditions
Authors: Zhi Chen, Yun-Fei Shao, Yong Ma, Mingsheng Wei, Le Zhang, Wei-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Acoustic Scene Classification (ASC) identifies an environment based on an audio signal. This paper explores ASC in low-resource conditions and proposes a novel model, DS-FlexiNet, which combines depthwise separable convolutions from MobileNetV2 with ResNet-inspired residual connections for a balance of efficiency and accuracy. To address hardware limitations and device heterogeneity, DS-FlexiNet employs Quantization Aware Training (QAT) for model compression and data augmentation methods like Auto Device Impulse Response (ADIR) and Freq-MixStyle (FMS) to improve cross-device generalization. Knowledge Distillation (KD) from twelve teacher models further enhances performance on unseen devices. The architecture includes a custom Residual Normalization layer to handle domain differences across devices, and depthwise separable convolutions reduce computational overhead without sacrificing feature representation. Experimental results show that DS-FlexiNet excels in both adaptability and performance under resource-constrained conditions.

Title: Piecewise Beam Training and Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Near-Field Communications
Authors: Jeongjae Lee, Songnam Hong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation challenge in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communication systems. Current channel estimation techniques require substantial pilot overhead and computational complexity, especially when the number of RIS elements is extremely large. To address this issue, we introduce a two-timescale channel estimation strategy that leverages the asymmetric coherence times of both the RIS-base station (BS) channel and the User-RIS channel. We derive a time-scaling property indicating that, for any two effective channels within the longer coherence time, one effective channel can be represented as the product of a vector, termed the small-timescale effective channel, and the other effective channel. By integrating the estimated effective channel from the initial time block with observations from our piecewise beam training, we present an efficient method for estimating subsequent small-timescale effective channels. We theoretically verify the efficacy of the proposed RIS design and demonstrate, through simulations, that our channel estimation method outperforms existing methods in pilot overhead and computational complexity across various realistic channel models.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Digital Twins: Robust Model Predictive Control using Time-Series Deep Quantile Learning
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Vispi Karkaria, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twins, virtual replicas of physical systems that enable real-time monitoring, model updates, predictions, and decision-making, present novel avenues for proactive control strategies for autonomous systems. However, achieving real-time decision-making in Digital Twins considering uncertainty necessitates an efficient uncertainty quantification (UQ) approach and optimization driven by accurate predictions of system behaviors, which remains a challenge for learning-based methods. This paper presents a simultaneous multi-step robust model predictive control (MPC) framework that incorporates real-time decision-making with uncertainty awareness for Digital Twin systems. Leveraging a multistep ahead predictor named Time-Series Dense Encoder (TiDE) as the surrogate model, this framework differs from conventional MPC models that provide only one-step ahead predictions. In contrast, TiDE can predict future states within the prediction horizon in a one-shot, significantly accelerating MPC. Furthermore, quantile regression is employed with the training of TiDE to perform flexible while computationally efficient UQ on data uncertainty. Consequently, with the deep learning quantiles, the robust MPC problem is formulated into a deterministic optimization problem and provides a safety buffer that accommodates disturbances to enhance constraint satisfaction rate. As a result, the proposed method outperforms existing robust MPC methods by providing less-conservative UQ and has demonstrated efficacy in an engineering case study involving Directed Energy Deposition (DED) additive manufacturing. This proactive while uncertainty-aware control capability positions the proposed method as a potent tool for future Digital Twin applications and real-time process control in engineering systems.

Title: Perception-Guided EEG Analysis: A Deep Learning Approach Inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) Theory
Authors: BG Tong
Abstract: Objective: This study explores a novel deep learning approach for EEG analysis and perceptual state guidance, inspired by Level of Detail (LOD) theory. The goal is to improve perceptual state identification accuracy and advance personalized psychological therapy. Methods: Portable EEG devices and music rhythm signals were used for data collection. LOD theory was applied to dynamically adjust EEG signal processing, extracting core perceptual features. A Unity-based software system integrated EEG data with audio materials. The deep learning model combined a CNN for feature extraction and classification, and a DQN for reinforcement learning to optimize rhythm adjustments. Results: The CNN achieved 94.05% accuracy in perceptual state classification. The DQN guided subjects to target states with a 92.45% success rate, averaging 13.2 rhythm cycles. However, only 50% of users reported psychological alignment with the target state, indicating room for improvement. Discussion: The results validate the potential of LOD-based EEG biofeedback. Limitations include dataset source, label subjectivity, and reward function optimization. Future work will expand to diverse subjects, incorporate varied musical elements, and refine reward functions for better generalization and personalization.

Title: Sampled-Data Control using Hermite-Obreschkoff Methods with an IDA-PBC Example
Authors: Le Zhang, Paul Kotyczka
Abstract: The motivation for this paper is the implementation of nonlinear state feedback control, designed based on the continuous-time plant model, in a sampled control loop under relatively slow sampling. In previous work we have shown that using one-step predictions of the target dynamics with higher order integration schemes, together with possibly higher order input shaping, is a simple and effective way to increase the feasible sampling times until performance degradation and instability occur. In this contribution we present a unifying derivation for arbitrary orders of the previously used Lobatto IIIA collocation and Hermite interpolation schemes through the Hermite-Obreschkoff formula. We derive, moreover, an IDA-PBC controller for a magnetic levitation system, which requires a non-constant target interconnection matrix, and show experimental results.

Title: SE(3)-Based Trajectory Optimization and Target Tracking in UAV-Enabled ISAC Systems
Authors: Dongxiao Xu, Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Moritz Wiese, Ullrich J. Moenich, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach to enhance sensing capabilities in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems by leveraging UAV mobility as a mono-static radar. By integrating uniform planar arrays (UPAs) and modeling the UAV dynamics in $SE(3)$, we address key challenges such as 3D space sensing and trajectory design. We propose a target tracking scheme using extended Kalman filtering (EKF) in $SE(3)$, along with trajectory optimization based on the conditional Posterior Cramer-Rao bound (CPCRB). Numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed trajectory design in enhancing performance of target tracking and physical parameter estimation in UAV-enabled MIMO-OFDM ISAC systems.

Title: Investigating the Feasibility of Patch-based Inference for Generalized Diffusion Priors in Inverse Problems for Medical Images
Authors: Saikat Roy, Mahmoud Mostapha, Radu Miron, Matt Holbrook, Mariappan Nadar
Abstract: Plug-and-play approaches to solving inverse problems such as restoration and super-resolution have recently benefited from Diffusion-based generative priors for natural as well as medical images. However, solutions often use the standard albeit computationally intensive route of training and inferring with the whole image on the diffusion prior. While patch-based approaches to evaluating diffusion priors in plug-and-play methods have received some interest, they remain an open area of study. In this work, we explore the feasibility of the usage of patches for training and inference of a diffusion prior on MRI images. We explore the minor adaptation necessary for artifact avoidance, the performance and the efficiency of memory usage of patch-based methods as well as the adaptability of whole image training to patch-based evaluation - evaluating across multiple plug-and-play methods, tasks and datasets.

Title: Compression and Distillation of Data Quadruplets in Non-intrusive Reduced-order Modeling
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar
Abstract: This paper introduces a quadrature-free, data-driven approach to balanced truncation for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. The method non-intrusively constructs reduced-order models using available transfer function samples from the right half of the $s$-plane. It is highlighted that the proposed data-driven balanced truncation and existing quadrature-based balanced truncation algorithms share a common feature: both compress their respective data quadruplets to derive reduced-order models. Additionally, it is demonstrated that by using different compression strategies, these quadruplets can be utilized to develop three data-driven formulations of the IRKA for both continuous-time and discrete-time systems. These formulations non-intrusively generate reduced models using transfer function samples from the $j\omega$-axis or the right half of the $s$-plane, or impulse response samples. Notably, these IRKA formulations eliminate the necessity of computing new transfer function samples as IRKA iteratively updates the interpolation points. The efficacy of the proposed algorithms is validated through numerical examples, which show that the proposed data-driven approaches perform comparably to their intrusive counterparts.

Title: Flat-Top Beamforming with Efficient Array-Fed RIS
Authors: Krishan Kumar Tiwari, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: Flat-top beam designs are essential for uniform power distribution over a wide angular sector for applications such as 5G/6G networks, beaconing, satellite communications, radar systems, etc. Low sidelobe levels with steep transitions allow negligible cross sector illumination. Active array designs requiring amplitude taper suffer from poor power amplifier utilization. Phase only designs, e.g., Zadoff-Chu or generalized step chirp polyphase sequence methods, often require large active antenna arrays which in turns increases the hardware complexity and reduces the energy efficiency. In our recently proposed novel array-fed reflective intelligent surface (RIS) architecture, the small ($2 \times 2$) active array has uniform (principal eigenmode) amplitude weighting. We now present a pragmatic flat-top pattern design method for practical array (RIS) sizes, which outperforms current state-of-the-art in terms of design superiority, energy efficiency, and deployment feasibility. This novel design holds promise for advancing sustainable wireless technologies in next-generation communication systems, including applications such as beaconing, broadcast signaling, and hierarchical beamforming, while mitigating the environmental impact of high-energy antenna arrays.

Title: MVCNet: Multi-View Contrastive Network for Motor Imagery Classification
Authors: Ziwei Wang, Siyang Li, Xiaoqing Chen, Wei Li, Dongrui Wu
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) enable neural interaction by decoding brain activity for external communication. Motor imagery (MI) decoding has received significant attention due to its intuitive mechanism. However, most existing models rely on single-stream architectures and overlook the multi-view nature of EEG signals, leading to limited performance and generalization. We propose a multi-view contrastive network (MVCNet), a dual-branch architecture that parallelly integrates CNN and Transformer models to capture both local spatial-temporal features and global temporal dependencies. To enhance the informativeness of training data, MVCNet incorporates a unified augmentation pipeline across time, frequency, and spatial domains. Two contrastive modules are further introduced: a cross-view contrastive module that enforces consistency of original and augmented views, and a cross-model contrastive module that aligns features extracted from both branches. Final representations are fused and jointly optimized by contrastive and classification losses. Experiments on five public MI datasets across three scenarios demonstrate that MVCNet consistently outperforms seven state-of-the-art MI decoding networks, highlighting its effectiveness and generalization ability. MVCNet provides a robust solution for MI decoding by integrating multi-view information and dual-branch modeling, contributing to the development of more reliable BCI systems.

Title: Detecting Long QT Syndrome and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block using Single-Lead AI-ECG: A Multi-Center Real-World Study
Authors: Sumei Fan, Deyun Zhang, Yue Wang, Shijia Geng, Kun Lu, Meng Sang, Weilun Xu, Haixue Wang, Qinghao Zhao, Chuandong Cheng, Peng Wang, Shenda Hong
Abstract: Home-based single-lead AI-ECG devices have enabled continuous, real-world cardiac monitoring. However, the accuracy of parameter calculations from single-lead AI-ECG algorithm remains to be fully validated, which is critical for conditions such as Long QT Syndrome (LQTS) and First-Degree Atrioventricular Block (AVBI). In this multicenter study, we assessed FeatureDB, an ECG measurements computation algorithm, in the context of single-lead monitoring using three annotated datasets: PTB-XL+ (n=21,354), CSE (n=105), and HeartVoice-ECG-lite (n=369). FeatureDB showed strong correlation with standard ECG machines (12SL and Uni-G) in key measurements (PR, QRS, QT, QTc), and high agreement confirmed by Bland-Altman analysis. In detecting LQTS (AUC=0.786) and AVBI (AUC=0.684), FeatureDB demonstrated diagnostic performance comparable to commercial ECG systems (12SL: 0.859/0.716; Uni-G: 0.817/0.605), significantly outperforming ECGDeli (0.501/0.569). Notably, FeatureDB can operate locally on resource-limited devices, facilitating use in low-connectivity settings. These findings confirm the clinical reliability of FeatureDB for single-lead ECG diagnostics and highlight its potential to bridge traditional ECG diagnostics with wearable technology for scalable cardiovascular monitoring and early intervention.

Title: Inversion-free feed-forward and feedback control of MSM based actuator with large non-smooth input hysteresis
Authors: Michael Ruderman, Gianluca Giostra, Matteo Sette
Abstract: Dynamic systems with a large and non-smooth hysteresis in the feedforward channel challenge the design of feedback control since the instantaneous input gain is varying during the operation, in the worst case between zero and infinity. Magnetic shape memory (MSM) actuators with multi-stable transitions represent such untypical system plant with only the output displacement being measured. This paper provides a case study of designing the feedforward and feedback control system for an MSM-based actuator setup with a fairly high level of the output sensing noise. First, the recently introduced inversion-free feedforward hysteresis compensator is adapted for the Krasnoselskii-Pokrovskii operator model. Then, a robust feedback proportional-integral (PI) loop shaping is performed, while taking into account the lagging behavior of the low-pass filtering and system uncertainties. Experimental results show that the parallel action of feedforward and feedback parts improves the overall performance of position control.

Title: Conditional Electrocardiogram Generation Using Hierarchical Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Ivan Sviridov, Konstantin Egorov
Abstract: Cardiovascular diseases (CVDs) are disorders impacting the heart and circulatory system. These disorders are the foremost and continuously escalating cause of mortality worldwide. One of the main tasks when working with CVDs is analyzing and identifying pathologies on a 12-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) with a standard 10-second duration. Using machine learning (ML) in automatic ECG analysis increases CVD diagnostics' availability, speed, and accuracy. However, the most significant difficulty in developing ML models is obtaining a sufficient training dataset. Due to the limitations of medical data usage, such as expensiveness, errors, the ambiguity of labels, imbalance of classes, and privacy issues, utilizing synthetic samples depending on specific pathologies bypasses these restrictions and improves algorithm quality. Existing solutions for the conditional generation of ECG signals are mainly built on Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), and only a few papers consider the architectures based on Variational Autoencoders (VAEs), showing comparable results in recent works. This paper proposes the publicly available conditional Nouveau VAE model for ECG signal generation (cNVAE-ECG), which produces high-resolution ECGs with multiple pathologies. We provide an extensive comparison of the proposed model on various practical downstream tasks, including transfer learning scenarios showing an area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) increase up to 2% surpassing GAN-like competitors.

Title: Survival Analysis with Machine Learning for Predicting Li-ion Battery Remaining Useful Life
Authors: Jingyuan Xue, Longfei Wei, Fang Sheng, Jianfei Zhang
Abstract: Battery degradation significantly impacts the reliability and efficiency of energy storage systems, particularly in electric vehicles and industrial applications. Predicting the remaining useful life (RUL) of lithium-ion batteries is crucial for optimizing maintenance schedules, reducing costs, and improving safety. Traditional RUL prediction methods often struggle with nonlinear degradation patterns and uncertainty quantification. To address these challenges, we propose a hybrid survival analysis framework integrating survival data reconstruction, survival model learning, and survival probability estimation. Our approach transforms battery voltage time series into time-to-failure data using path signatures. The multiple Cox-based survival models and machine-learning-based methods, such as DeepHit and MTLR, are learned to predict battery failure-free probabilities over time. Experiments conducted on the Toyota battery and NASA battery datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, achieving high time-dependent AUC and concordance index (C-Index) while maintaining a low integrated Brier score. The data and source codes for this work are available to the public at this https URL.

Title: Learning from Disengagements: An Analysis of Safety Driver Interventions during Remote Driving
Authors: Ole Hans, Jürgen Adamy
Abstract: This study investigates disengagements of Remote Driving Systems (RDS) based on interventions by an in-vehicle Safety Drivers (SD) in real-world Operational Design Domains (ODD) with a focus on Remote Driver (RD) performance during their driving training. Based on an analysis of over 14,000 km on remote driving data, the relationship between the driving experience of 25 RD and the frequency of disengagements is systematically investigated. The results show that the number of SD interventions decreases significantly within the first 400 km of driving experience, which illustrates a clear learning curve of the RD. In addition, the most common causes for 183 disengagements analyzed are identified and categorized, whereby four main scenarios for SD interventions were identified and illustrated. The results emphasize the need for experience-based and targeted training programs aimed at developing basic driving skills early on, thereby increasing the safety, controllability and efficiency of RDS, especially in complex urban environment ODDs.

Title: Neyman-Pearson Detector for Ambient Backscatter Zero-Energy-Devices Beacons
Authors: Shanglin Yang, Jean-Marie Gorce, Muhammad Jehangir Khan, Dinh-Thuy Phan-Huy, Guillaume Villemaud
Abstract: Recently, a novel ultra-low power indoor wireless positioning system has been proposed. In this system, Zero-Energy-Devices (ZED) beacons are deployed in Indoor environments, and located on a map with unique broadcast identifiers. They harvest ambient energy to power themselves and backscatter ambient waves from cellular networks to send their identifiers. This paper presents a novel detection method for ZEDs in ambient backscatter systems, with an emphasis on performance evaluation through experimental setups and simulations. We introduce a Neyman-Pearson detection framework, which leverages a predefined false alarm probability to determine the optimal detection threshold. This method, applied to the analysis of backscatter signals in a controlled testbed environment, incorporates the use of BC sequences to enhance signal detection accuracy. The experimental setup, conducted on the FIT/CorteXlab testbed, employs a two-node configuration for signal transmission and reception. Key performance metrics, which is the peak-to-lobe ratio, is evaluated, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed detection model. The results demonstrate a detection system that effectively handles varying noise levels and identifies ZEDs with high reliability. The simulation results show the robustness of the model, highlighting its capacity to achieve desired detection performance even with stringent false alarm thresholds. This work paves the way for robust ZED detection in real-world scenarios, contributing to the advancement of wireless communication technologies.

Title: A mixed-integer framework for analyzing neural network-based controllers for piecewise affine systems with bounded disturbances
Authors: Dieter Teichrib, Moritz Schulze Darup
Abstract: We present a method for representing the closed-loop dynamics of piecewise affine (PWA) systems with bounded additive disturbances and neural network-based controllers as mixed-integer (MI) linear constraints. We show that such representations enable the computation of robustly positively invariant (RPI) sets for the specified system class by solving MI linear programs. These RPI sets can subsequently be used to certify stability and constraint satisfaction. Furthermore, the approach allows to handle non-linear systems based on suitable PWA approximations and corresponding error bounds, which can be interpreted as the bounded disturbances from above.

Title: UNILoc: Unified Localization Combining Model-Based Geometry and Unsupervised Learning
Authors: Yuhao Zhang, Guangjin Pan, Musa Furkan Keskin, Ossi Kaltiokallio, Mikko Valkama, Henk Wymeersch
Abstract: Accurate mobile device localization is critical for emerging 5G/6G applications such as autonomous vehicles and augmented reality. In this paper, we propose a unified localization method that integrates model-based and machine learning (ML)-based methods to reap their respective advantages by exploiting available map information. In order to avoid supervised learning, we generate training labels automatically via optimal transport (OT) by fusing geometric estimates with building layouts. Ray-tracing based simulations are carried out to demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves positioning accuracy for both line-of-sight (LoS) users (compared to ML-based methods) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) users (compared to model-based methods). Remarkably, the unified method is able to achieve competitive overall performance with the fully-supervised fingerprinting, while eliminating the need for cumbersome labeled data measurement and collection.

Title: Quaternion Domain Super MDS for 3D Localization
Authors: Keigo Masuoka, Takumi Takahashi, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Hideki Ochiai
Abstract: We propose a novel low-complexity three-dimensional (3D) localization algorithm for wireless sensor networks, termed quaternion-domain super multidimensional scaling (QD-SMDS). This algorithm reformulates the conventional SMDS, which was originally developed in the real domain, into the quaternion domain. By representing 3D coordinates as quaternions, the method enables the construction of a rank-1 Gram edge kernel (GEK) matrix that integrates both relative distance and angular (phase) information between nodes, maximizing the noise reduction effect achieved through low-rank truncation via singular value decomposition (SVD). The simulation results indicate that the proposed method demonstrates a notable enhancement in localization accuracy relative to the conventional SMDS algorithm, particularly in scenarios characterized by substantial measurement errors.

Title: Physics-Driven Neural Compensation For Electrical Impedance Tomography
Authors: Chuyu Wang, Huiting Deng, Dong Liu
Abstract: Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) provides a non-invasive, portable imaging modality with significant potential in medical and industrial applications. Despite its advantages, EIT encounters two primary challenges: the ill-posed nature of its inverse problem and the spatially variable, location-dependent sensitivity distribution. Traditional model-based methods mitigate ill-posedness through regularization but overlook sensitivity variability, while supervised deep learning approaches require extensive training data and lack generalization. Recent developments in neural fields have introduced implicit regularization techniques for image reconstruction, but these methods typically neglect the physical principles underlying EIT, thus limiting their effectiveness. In this study, we propose PhyNC (Physics-driven Neural Compensation), an unsupervised deep learning framework that incorporates the physical principles of EIT. PhyNC addresses both the ill-posed inverse problem and the sensitivity distribution by dynamically allocating neural representational capacity to regions with lower sensitivity, ensuring accurate and balanced conductivity reconstructions. Extensive evaluations on both simulated and experimental data demonstrate that PhyNC outperforms existing methods in terms of detail preservation and artifact resistance, particularly in low-sensitivity regions. Our approach enhances the robustness of EIT reconstructions and provides a flexible framework that can be adapted to other imaging modalities with similar challenges.

Title: Characterizing Trust and Resilience in Distributed Consensus for Cyberphysical Systems
Authors: Michal Yemini, Angelia Nedić, Andrea Goldsmith, Stephanie Gil
Abstract: This work considers the problem of resilient consensus where stochastic values of trust between agents are available. Specifically, we derive a unified mathematical framework to characterize convergence, deviation of the consensus from the true consensus value, and expected convergence rate, when there exists additional information of trust between agents. We show that under certain conditions on the stochastic trust values and consensus protocol: 1) almost sure convergence to a common limit value is possible even when malicious agents constitute more than half of the network connectivity, 2) the deviation of the converged limit, from the case where there is no attack, i.e., the true consensus value, can be bounded with probability that approaches 1 exponentially, and 3) correct classification of malicious and legitimate agents can be attained in finite time almost surely. Further, the expected convergence rate decays exponentially as a function of the quality of the trust observations between agents.

Authors: Nouman Khan, Vijay Subramanian
Abstract: The work studies the problem of decentralized constrained POMDPs in a team-setting where multiple nonstrategic agents have asymmetric information. Using an extension of Sion's Minimax theorem for functions with positive infinity and results on weak-convergence of measures, strong duality is established for the setting of infinite-horizon expected total discounted costs when the observations lie in a countable space, the actions are chosen from a finite space, the constraint costs are bounded, and the objective cost is bounded from below.

Title: ComFace: Facial Representation Learning with Synthetic Data for Comparing Faces
Authors: Yusuke Akamatsu, Terumi Umematsu, Hitoshi Imaoka, Shizuko Gomi, Hideo Tsurushima
Abstract: Daily monitoring of intra-personal facial changes associated with health and emotional conditions has great potential to be useful for medical, healthcare, and emotion recognition fields. However, the approach for capturing intra-personal facial changes is relatively unexplored due to the difficulty of collecting temporally changing face images. In this paper, we propose a facial representation learning method using synthetic images for comparing faces, called ComFace, which is designed to capture intra-personal facial changes. For effective representation learning, ComFace aims to acquire two feature representations, i.e., inter-personal facial differences and intra-personal facial changes. The key point of our method is the use of synthetic face images to overcome the limitations of collecting real intra-personal face images. Facial representations learned by ComFace are transferred to three extensive downstream tasks for comparing faces: estimating facial expression changes, weight changes, and age changes from two face images of the same individual. Our ComFace, trained using only synthetic data, achieves comparable to or better transfer performance than general pre-training and state-of-the-art representation learning methods trained using real images.

Title: EM-GANSim: Real-time and Accurate EM Simulation Using Conditional GANs for 3D Indoor Scenes
Authors: Ruichen Wang, Dinesh Manocha
Abstract: We present a novel machine-learning (ML) approach (EM-GANSim) for real-time electromagnetic (EM) propagation that is used for wireless communication simulation in 3D indoor environments. Our approach uses a modified conditional Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) that incorporates encoded geometry and transmitter location while adhering to the electromagnetic propagation theory. The overall physically-inspired learning is able to predict the power distribution in 3D scenes, which is represented using heatmaps. We evaluated our method on 15 complex 3D indoor environments, with 4 additional scenarios later included in the results, showcasing the generalizability of the model across diverse conditions. Our overall accuracy is comparable to ray tracing-based EM simulation, as evidenced by lower mean squared error values. Furthermore, our GAN-based method drastically reduces the computation time, achieving a 5X speedup on complex benchmarks. In practice, it can compute the signal strength in a few milliseconds on any location in 3D indoor environments. We also present a large dataset of 3D models and EM ray tracing-simulated heatmaps. To the best of our knowledge, EM-GANSim is the first real-time algorithm for EM simulation in complex 3D indoor environments. We plan to release the code and the dataset.

Authors: Jun Bai, Di Wu, Tristan Shelley, Peter Schubel, David Twine, John Russell, Xuesen Zeng, Ji Zhang
Abstract: Material defects (MD) represent a primary challenge affecting product performance and giving rise to safety issues in related products. The rapid and accurate identification and localization of MD constitute crucial research endeavors in addressing contemporary challenges associated with MD. In recent years, propelled by the swift advancement of machine learning (ML) technologies, particularly exemplified by deep learning, ML has swiftly emerged as the core technology and a prominent research direction for material defect detection (MDD). Through a comprehensive review of the latest literature, we systematically survey the ML techniques applied in MDD into five categories: unsupervised learning, supervised learning, semi-supervised learning, reinforcement learning, and generative learning. We provide a detailed analysis of the main principles and techniques used, together with the advantages and potential challenges associated with these techniques. Furthermore, the survey focuses on the techniques for defect detection in composite materials, which are important types of materials enjoying increasingly wide application in various industries such as aerospace, automotive, construction, and renewable energy. Finally, the survey explores potential future directions in MDD utilizing ML technologies. This survey consolidates ML-based MDD literature and provides a foundation for future research and practice.

Title: Think Deep and Fast: Learning Neural Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics from Inverse Dynamic Games for Split-Second Interactions
Authors: Haimin Hu, Jaime Fernández Fisac, Naomi Ehrich Leonard, Deepak Gopinath, Jonathan DeCastro, Guy Rosman
Abstract: Non-cooperative interactions commonly occur in multi-agent scenarios such as car racing, where an ego vehicle can choose to overtake the rival, or stay behind it until a safe overtaking "corridor" opens. While an expert human can do well at making such time-sensitive decisions, autonomous agents are incapable of rapidly reasoning about complex, potentially conflicting options, leading to suboptimal behaviors such as deadlocks. Recently, the nonlinear opinion dynamics (NOD) model has proven to exhibit fast opinion formation and avoidance of decision deadlocks. However, NOD modeling parameters are oftentimes assumed fixed, limiting their applicability in complex and dynamic environments. It remains an open challenge to determine such parameters automatically and adaptively, accounting for the ever-changing environment. In this work, we propose for the first time a learning-based and game-theoretic approach to synthesize a Neural NOD model from expert demonstrations, given as a dataset containing (possibly incomplete) state and action trajectories of interacting agents. We demonstrate Neural NOD's ability to make fast and deadlock-free decisions in a simulated autonomous racing example. We find that Neural NOD consistently outperforms the state-of-the-art data-driven inverse game baseline in terms of safety and overtaking performance.

Title: Hierarchical Attention Diffusion Networks with Object Priors for Video Change Detection
Authors: Andrew Kiruluta, Eric Lundy, Andreas Lemos
Abstract: We present a unified change detection pipeline that combines instance level masking, multi\-scale attention within a denoising diffusion model, and per pixel semantic classification, all refined via SSIM to match human perception. By first isolating only temporally novel objects with Mask R\-CNN, then guiding diffusion updates through hierarchical cross attention to object and global contexts, and finally categorizing each pixel into one of C change types, our method delivers detailed, interpretable multi\-class maps. It outperforms traditional differencing, Siamese CNNs, and GAN\-based detectors by 10\-25 points in F1 and IoU on both synthetic and real world benchmarks, marking a new state of the art in remote sensing change detection.

Title: MAGICS: Adversarial RL with Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg for Convergent Neural Synthesis of Robot Safety
Authors: Justin Wang, Haimin Hu, Duy Phuong Nguyen, Jaime Fernández Fisac
Abstract: While robust optimal control theory provides a rigorous framework to compute robot control policies that are provably safe, it struggles to scale to high-dimensional problems, leading to increased use of deep learning for tractable synthesis of robot safety. Unfortunately, existing neural safety synthesis methods often lack convergence guarantees and solution interpretability. In this paper, we present Minimax Actors Guided by Implicit Critic Stackelberg (MAGICS), a novel adversarial reinforcement learning (RL) algorithm that guarantees local convergence to a minimax equilibrium solution. We then build on this approach to provide local convergence guarantees for a general deep RL-based robot safety synthesis algorithm. Through both simulation studies on OpenAI Gym environments and hardware experiments with a 36-dimensional quadruped robot, we show that MAGICS can yield robust control policies outperforming the state-of-the-art neural safety synthesis methods.

Title: Sample-Efficient Quantum State Tomography for Structured Quantum States in One Dimension
Authors: Zhen Qin, Casey Jameson, Alireza Goldar, Michael B. Wakin, Zhexuan Gong, Zhihui Zhu
Abstract: While quantum state tomography (QST) remains the gold standard for benchmarking and verifying quantum devices, it requires an exponentially large number of measurements and classical computational resources for generic quantum many-body systems, making it impractical even for intermediate-size quantum devices. Fortunately, many physical quantum states often exhibit certain low-dimensional structures that enable the development of efficient QST. A notable example is the class of states represented by matrix product operators (MPOs) with a finite matrix/bond dimension, which include most physical states in one dimension and where the number of independent parameters describing the states only grows linearly with the number of qubits. Whether a sample efficient quantum state tomography protocol, where the number of required state copies scales only linearly as the number of parameters describing the state, exists for a generic MPO state still remains an important open question. In this paper, we answer this fundamental question affirmatively by using a class of informationally complete positive operator-valued measures (IC-POVMs) -- including symmetric IC-POVMs (SIC-POVMs) and spherical $t$-designs -- focusing on sample complexity while not accounting for the implementation complexity of the measurement settings. For SIC-POVMs and (approximate) spherical 2-designs, we show that the number of state copies to guarantee bounded recovery error of an MPO state with a constrained least-squares estimator depends on the probability distribution of the MPO under the POVM but scales only linearly with $n$ when the distribution is approximately uniform. For spherical $t$-designs with $t\ge3$, we prove that only a number of state copies proportional to the number of independent parameters in the MPO is needed for a guaranteed recovery of \emph{any} state represented by an MPO.

Title: Variable Bitrate Residual Vector Quantization for Audio Coding
Authors: Yunkee Chae, Woosung Choi, Yuhta Takida, Junghyun Koo, Yukara Ikemiya, Zhi Zhong, Kin Wai Cheuk, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Kyogu Lee, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Recent state-of-the-art neural audio compression models have progressively adopted residual vector quantization (RVQ). Despite this success, these models employ a fixed number of codebooks per frame, which can be suboptimal in terms of rate-distortion tradeoff, particularly in scenarios with simple input audio, such as silence. To address this limitation, we propose variable bitrate RVQ (VRVQ) for audio codecs, which allows for more efficient coding by adapting the number of codebooks used per frame. Furthermore, we propose a gradient estimation method for the non-differentiable masking operation that transforms from the importance map to the binary importance mask, improving model training via a straight-through estimator. We demonstrate that the proposed training framework achieves superior results compared to the baseline method and shows further improvement when applied to the current state-of-the-art codec.

Title: Linear Supervision for Nonlinear, High-Dimensional Neural Control and Differential Games
Authors: William Sharpless, Zeyuan Feng, Somil Bansal, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: As the dimension of a system increases, traditional methods for control and differential games rapidly become intractable, making the design of safe autonomous agents challenging in complex or team settings. Deep-learning approaches avoid discretization and yield numerous successes in robotics and autonomy, but at a higher dimensional limit, accuracy falls as sampling becomes less efficient. We propose using rapidly generated linear solutions to the partial differential equation (PDE) arising in the problem to accelerate and improve learned value functions for guidance in high-dimensional, nonlinear problems. We define two programs that combine supervision of the linear solution with a standard PDE loss. We demonstrate that these programs offer improvements in speed and accuracy in both a 50-D differential game problem and a 10-D quadrotor control problem.

Title: Stochastic LQR Design With Disturbance Preview
Authors: Jietian Liu, Laurent Lessard, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper considers the discrete-time, stochastic LQR problem with $p$ steps of disturbance preview information where $p$ is finite. We first derive the solution for this problem on a finite horizon with linear, time-varying dynamics and time-varying costs. Next, we derive the solution on the infinite horizon with linear, time-invariant dynamics and time-invariant costs. Our proofs rely on the well-known principle of optimality. We provide an independent proof for the principle of optimality that relies only on nested information structure. Finally, we show that the finite preview controller converges to the optimal noncausal controller as the preview horizon $p$ tends to infinity. We also provide a simple example to illustrate both the finite and infinite horizon results.

Title: A Multi-modal Approach to Dysarthria Detection and Severity Assessment Using Speech and Text Information
Authors: Anuprabha M, Krishna Gurugubelli, V Kesavaraj, Anil Kumar Vuppala
Abstract: Automatic detection and severity assessment of dysarthria are crucial for delivering targeted therapeutic interventions to patients. While most existing research focuses primarily on speech modality, this study introduces a novel approach that leverages both speech and text modalities. By employing cross-attention mechanism, our method learns the acoustic and linguistic similarities between speech and text representations. This approach assesses specifically the pronunciation deviations across different severity levels, thereby enhancing the accuracy of dysarthric detection and severity assessment. All the experiments have been performed using UA-Speech dysarthric database. Improved accuracies of 99.53% and 93.20% in detection, and 98.12% and 51.97% for severity assessment have been achieved when speaker-dependent and speaker-independent, unseen and seen words settings are used. These findings suggest that by integrating text information, which provides a reference linguistic knowledge, a more robust framework has been developed for dysarthric detection and assessment, thereby potentially leading to more effective diagnoses.

Title: FineVQ: Fine-Grained User Generated Content Video Quality Assessment
Authors: Huiyu Duan, Qiang Hu, Jiarui Wang, Liu Yang, Zitong Xu, Lu Liu, Xiongkuo Min, Chunlei Cai, Tianxiao Ye, Xiaoyun Zhang, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: The rapid growth of user-generated content (UGC) videos has produced an urgent need for effective video quality assessment (VQA) algorithms to monitor video quality and guide optimization and recommendation procedures. However, current VQA models generally only give an overall rating for a UGC video, which lacks fine-grained labels for serving video processing and recommendation applications. To address the challenges and promote the development of UGC videos, we establish the first large-scale Fine-grained Video quality assessment Database, termed FineVD, which comprises 6104 UGC videos with fine-grained quality scores and descriptions across multiple dimensions. Based on this database, we propose a Fine-grained Video Quality assessment (FineVQ) model to learn the fine-grained quality of UGC videos, with the capabilities of quality rating, quality scoring, and quality attribution. Extensive experimental results demonstrate that our proposed FineVQ can produce fine-grained video-quality results and achieve state-of-the-art performance on FineVD and other commonly used UGC-VQA datasets.

Title: Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement
Authors: Anzheng Tang, Jun-Bo Wang, Yijin Pan, Cheng Zeng, Yijian Chen, Hongkang Yu, Ming Xiao, Rodrigo C. de Lamare, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.

Title: Neuro-LIFT: A Neuromorphic, LLM-based Interactive Framework for Autonomous Drone FlighT at the Edge
Authors: Amogh Joshi, Sourav Sanyal, Kaushik Roy
Abstract: The integration of human-intuitive interactions into autonomous systems has been limited. Traditional Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems struggle with context and intent understanding, severely restricting human-robot interaction. Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have transformed this dynamic, allowing for intuitive and high-level communication through speech and text, and bridging the gap between human commands and robotic actions. Additionally, autonomous navigation has emerged as a central focus in robotics research, with artificial intelligence (AI) increasingly being leveraged to enhance these systems. However, existing AI-based navigation algorithms face significant challenges in latency-critical tasks where rapid decision-making is critical. Traditional frame-based vision systems, while effective for high-level decision-making, suffer from high energy consumption and latency, limiting their applicability in real-time scenarios. Neuromorphic vision systems, combining event-based cameras and spiking neural networks (SNNs), offer a promising alternative by enabling energy-efficient, low-latency navigation. Despite their potential, real-world implementations of these systems, particularly on physical platforms such as drones, remain scarce. In this work, we present Neuro-LIFT, a real-time neuromorphic navigation framework implemented on a Parrot Bebop2 quadrotor. Leveraging an LLM for natural language processing, Neuro-LIFT translates human speech into high-level planning commands which are then autonomously executed using event-based neuromorphic vision and physics-driven planning. Our framework demonstrates its capabilities in navigating in a dynamic environment, avoiding obstacles, and adapting to human instructions in real-time.

Title: ASAP: Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics for Learning Agile Humanoid Whole-Body Skills

Abstract: Humanoid robots hold the potential for unparalleled versatility in performing human-like, whole-body skills. However, achieving agile and coordinated whole-body motions remains a significant challenge due to the dynamics mismatch between simulation and the real world. Existing approaches, such as system identification (SysID) and domain randomization (DR) methods, often rely on labor-intensive parameter tuning or result in overly conservative policies that sacrifice agility. In this paper, we present ASAP (Aligning Simulation and Real-World Physics), a two-stage framework designed to tackle the dynamics mismatch and enable agile humanoid whole-body skills. In the first stage, we pre-train motion tracking policies in simulation using retargeted human motion data. In the second stage, we deploy the policies in the real world and collect real-world data to train a delta (residual) action model that compensates for the dynamics mismatch. Then, ASAP fine-tunes pre-trained policies with the delta action model integrated into the simulator to align effectively with real-world dynamics. We evaluate ASAP across three transfer scenarios: IsaacGym to IsaacSim, IsaacGym to Genesis, and IsaacGym to the real-world Unitree G1 humanoid robot. Our approach significantly improves agility and whole-body coordination across various dynamic motions, reducing tracking error compared to SysID, DR, and delta dynamics learning baselines. ASAP enables highly agile motions that were previously difficult to achieve, demonstrating the potential of delta action learning in bridging simulation and real-world dynamics. These results suggest a promising sim-to-real direction for developing more expressive and agile humanoids.

Title: Gait-Net-augmented Implicit Kino-dynamic MPC for Dynamic Variable-frequency Humanoid Locomotion over Discrete Terrains
Authors: Junheng Li, Ziwei Duan, Junchao Ma, Quan Nguyen
Abstract: Reduced-order-based optimal control techniques for humanoid locomotion struggle to adapt step duration and placement simultaneously in dynamic walking gaits due to their reliance on fixed-time discretization, which limits responsiveness to various disturbances and results in suboptimal performance in challenging conditions. In this work, we propose a Gait-Net-augmented implicit kino-dynamic model-predictive control (MPC) to simultaneously optimize step location, step duration, and contact forces for natural variable-frequency locomotion. The proposed method incorporates a Gait-Net-augmented Sequential Convex MPC algorithm to solve multi-linearly constrained variables by iterative quadratic programs. At its core, a lightweight Gait-frequency Network (Gait-Net) determines the preferred step duration in terms of variable MPC sampling times, simplifying step duration optimization to the parameter level. Additionally, it enhances and updates the spatial reference trajectory within each sequential iteration by incorporating local solutions, allowing the projection of kinematic constraints to the design of reference trajectories. We validate the proposed algorithm in high-fidelity simulations and on small-size humanoid hardware, demonstrating its capability for variable-frequency and 3-D discrete terrain locomotion with only a one-step preview of terrain data.

Title: DDAT: Diffusion Policies Enforcing Dynamically Admissible Robot Trajectories
Authors: Jean-Baptiste Bouvier, Kanghyun Ryu, Kartik Nagpal, Qiayuan Liao, Koushil Sreenath, Negar Mehr
Abstract: Diffusion models excel at creating images and videos thanks to their multimodal generative capabilities. These same capabilities have made diffusion models increasingly popular in robotics research, where they are used for generating robot motion. However, the stochastic nature of diffusion models is fundamentally at odds with the precise dynamical equations describing the feasible motion of robots. Hence, generating dynamically admissible robot trajectories is a challenge for diffusion models. To alleviate this issue, we introduce DDAT: Diffusion policies for Dynamically Admissible Trajectories to generate provably admissible trajectories of black-box robotic systems using diffusion models. A sequence of states is a dynamically admissible trajectory if each state of the sequence belongs to the reachable set of its predecessor by the robot's equations of motion. To generate such trajectories, our diffusion policies project their predictions onto a dynamically admissible manifold during both training and inference to align the objective of the denoiser neural network with the dynamical admissibility constraint. The auto-regressive nature of these projections along with the black-box nature of robot dynamics render these projections immensely challenging. We thus enforce admissibility by iteratively sampling a polytopic under-approximation of the reachable set of a state onto which we project its predicted successor, before iterating this process with the projected successor. By producing accurate trajectories, this projection eliminates the need for diffusion models to continually replan, enabling one-shot long-horizon trajectory planning. We demonstrate that our framework generates higher quality dynamically admissible robot trajectories through extensive simulations on a quadcopter and various MuJoCo environments, along with real-world experiments on a Unitree GO1 and GO2.

Title: Distributed and Localized Covariance Control of Coupled Systems: A System Level Approach
Authors: Ahmed Khalil, Yoonjae Lee, Efstathios Bakolas
Abstract: This work is concerned with the finite-horizon optimal covariance steering of networked systems governed by discrete-time stochastic linear dynamics. In contrast with existing work that has only considered systems with dynamically decoupled agents, we consider a dynamically coupled system composed of interconnected subsystems subject to local communication constraints. In particular, we propose a distributed algorithm to compute the localized optimal feedback control policy for each individual subsystem, which depends only on the local state histories of its neighboring subsystems. Utilizing the system-level synthesis (SLS) framework, we first recast the localized covariance steering problem as a convex SLS problem with locality constraints. Subsequently, exploiting its partially separable structure, we decompose the latter problem into smaller subproblems, introducing a transformation to deal with nonseparable instances. Finally, we employ a variation of the consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to distribute computation across subsystems on account of their local information and communication constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm on a power system with 36 interconnected subsystems.

Title: Conformal Calibration: Ensuring the Reliability of Black-Box AI in Wireless Systems
Authors: Osvaldo Simeone, Sangwoo Park, Matteo Zecchin
Abstract: AI is poised to revolutionize telecommunication networks by boosting efficiency, automation, and decision-making. However, the black-box nature of most AI models introduces substantial risk, possibly deterring adoption by network operators. These risks are not addressed by the current prevailing deployment strategy, which typically follows a best-effort train-and-deploy paradigm. This paper reviews conformal calibration, a general framework that moves beyond the state of the art by adopting computationally lightweight, advanced statistical tools that offer formal reliability guarantees without requiring further training or fine-tuning. Conformal calibration encompasses pre-deployment calibration via uncertainty quantification or hyperparameter selection; online monitoring to detect and mitigate failures in real time; and counterfactual post-deployment performance analysis to address "what if" diagnostic questions after deployment. By weaving conformal calibration into the AI model lifecycle, network operators can establish confidence in black-box AI models as a dependable enabling technology for wireless systems.

Abstract: The emergence of sixth-generation and beyond communication systems is expected to fundamentally transform digital experiences through introducing unparalleled levels of intelligence, efficiency, and connectivity. A promising technology poised to enable this revolutionary vision is the wireless large AI model (WLAM), characterized by its exceptional capabilities in data processing, inference, and decision-making. In light of these remarkable capabilities, this paper provides a comprehensive survey of WLAM, elucidating its fundamental principles, diverse applications, critical challenges, and future research opportunities. We begin by introducing the background of WLAM and analyzing the key synergies with wireless networks, emphasizing the mutual benefits. Subsequently, we explore the foundational characteristics of WLAM, delving into their unique relevance in wireless environments. Then, the role of WLAM in optimizing wireless communication systems across various use cases and the reciprocal benefits are systematically investigated. Furthermore, we discuss the integration of WLAM with emerging technologies, highlighting their potential to enable transformative capabilities and breakthroughs in wireless communication. Finally, we thoroughly examine the high-level challenges hindering the practical implementation of WLAM and discuss pivotal future research directions.

Title: Fast Online Adaptive Neural MPC via Meta-Learning
Authors: Yu Mei, Xinyu Zhou, Shuyang Yu, Vaibhav Srivastava, Xiaobo Tan
Abstract: Data-driven model predictive control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential for improving robot control performance in the presence of model uncertainties. However, existing approaches often require extensive offline data collection and computationally intensive training, limiting their ability to adapt online. To address these challenges, this paper presents a fast online adaptive MPC framework that leverages neural networks integrated with Model-Agnostic Meta-Learning (MAML). Our approach focuses on few-shot adaptation of residual dynamics - capturing the discrepancy between nominal and true system behavior - using minimal online data and gradient steps. By embedding these meta-learned residual models into a computationally efficient L4CasADi-based MPC pipeline, the proposed method enables rapid model correction, enhances predictive accuracy, and improves real-time control performance. We validate the framework through simulation studies on a Van der Pol oscillator, a Cart-Pole system, and a 2D quadrotor. Results show significant gains in adaptation speed and prediction accuracy over both nominal MPC and nominal MPC augmented with a freshly initialized neural network, underscoring the effectiveness of our approach for real-time adaptive robot control.
