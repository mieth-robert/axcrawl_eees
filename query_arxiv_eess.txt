Title: Where is the Boundary: Multimodal Sensor Fusion Test Bench for Tissue Boundary Delineation
Authors: Zacharias Chen, Alexa Cristelle Cahilig, Sarah Dias, Prithu Kolar, Ravi Prakash, Patrick J. Codd
Abstract: Robot-assisted neurological surgery is receiving growing interest due to the improved dexterity, precision, and control of surgical tools, which results in better patient outcomes. However, such systems often limit surgeons' natural sensory feedback, which is crucial in identifying tissues -- particularly in oncological procedures where distinguishing between healthy and tumorous tissue is vital. While imaging and force sensing have addressed the lack of sensory feedback, limited research has explored multimodal sensing options for accurate tissue boundary delineation. We present a user-friendly, modular test bench designed to evaluate and integrate complementary multimodal sensors for tissue identification. Our proposed system first uses vision-based guidance to estimate boundary locations with visual cues, which are then refined using data acquired by contact microphones and a force sensor. Real-time data acquisition and visualization are supported via an interactive graphical interface. Experimental results demonstrate that multimodal fusion significantly improves material classification accuracy. The platform provides a scalable hardware-software solution for exploring sensor fusion in surgical applications and demonstrates the potential of multimodal approaches in real-time tissue boundary delineation.

Title: Variational volume reconstruction with the Deep Ritz Method
Authors: Conor Rowan, Sumedh Soman, John A. Evans
Abstract: We present a novel approach to variational volume reconstruction from sparse, noisy slice data using the Deep Ritz method. Motivated by biomedical imaging applications such as MRI-based slice-to-volume reconstruction (SVR), our approach addresses three key challenges: (i) the reliance on image segmentation to extract boundaries from noisy grayscale slice images, (ii) the need to reconstruct volumes from a limited number of slice planes, and (iii) the computational expense of traditional mesh-based methods. We formulate a variational objective that combines a regression loss designed to avoid image segmentation by operating on noisy slice data directly with a modified Cahn-Hilliard energy incorporating anisotropic diffusion to regularize the reconstructed geometry. We discretize the phase field with a neural network, approximate the objective at each optimization step with Monte Carlo integration, and use ADAM to find the minimum of the approximated variational objective. While the stochastic integration may not yield the true solution to the variational problem, we demonstrate that our method reliably produces high-quality reconstructed volumes in a matter of seconds, even when the slice data is sparse and noisy.

Title: Exploring Disentangled Neural Speech Codecs from Self-Supervised Representations
Authors: Ryo Aihara, Yoshiki Masuyama, Gordon Wichern, François G. Germain, Jonathan Le Roux
Abstract: Neural audio codecs (NACs), which use neural networks to generate compact audio representations, have garnered interest for their applicability to many downstream tasks -- especially quantized codecs due to their compatibility with large language models. However, unlike text, speech conveys not only linguistic content but also rich paralinguistic features. Encoding these elements in an entangled fashion may be suboptimal, as it limits flexibility. For instance, voice conversion (VC) aims to convert speaker characteristics while preserving the original linguistic content, which requires a disentangled representation. Inspired by VC methods utilizing $k$-means quantization with self-supervised features to disentangle phonetic information, we develop a discrete NAC capable of structured disentanglement. Experimental evaluations show that our approach achieves reconstruction performance on par with conventional NACs that do not explicitly perform disentanglement, while also matching the effectiveness of conventional VC techniques.

Title: Hardware-friendly IR-HARQ for Polar SCL Decoders
Authors: Marwan Jalaleddine, Jiajie Li, Warren J. Gross
Abstract: To extend the applications of polar codes within next-generation wireless communication systems, it is essential to incorporate support for Incremental Redundancy (IR) Hybrid Automatic Repeat Request (HARQ) schemes. The baseline IR-HARQ scheme's reliance on set-based operations leads to irregular memory access patterns, posing significant challenges for efficient hardware implementation. Furthermore, the introduction of new bit types increases the number of fast nodes that are decoded without traversing the sub-tree, resulting in a substantial area overhead when implemented in hardware. To address these issues and improve hardware compatibility, we propose transforming the set-based operations within the polar IR-HARQ scheme into binary vector operations. Additionally, we introduce a new fast node integration approach that avoids increasing the number of fast nodes, thereby minimizing the associated area overhead. Our proposed scheme results in a memory overhead of 25-27% compared to successive cancellation list (SCL) decoding without IR-HARQ support.

Title: Preprocessing Algorithm Leveraging Geometric Modeling for Scale Correction in Hyperspectral Images for Improved Unmixing Performance
Authors: Praveen Sumanasekara, Athulya Ratnayake, Buddhi Wijenayake, Keshawa Ratnayake, Roshan Godaliyadda, Parakrama Ekanayake, Vijitha Herath
Abstract: Spectral variability significantly impacts the accuracy and convergence of hyperspectral unmixing algorithms. While many methods address complex spectral variability, large-scale variations in spectral signature scale caused by factors such as topography, illumination, and shadowing remain a major challenge. These variations often degrade unmixing performance and complicate model fitting. In this paper, we propose a novel preprocessing algorithm that corrects scale-induced spectral variability prior to unmixing. By isolating and compensating for these large-scale multiplicative effects, the algorithm provides a cleaner input, enabling unmixing methods to focus more effectively on modeling nonlinear spectral variability and abundance estimation. We present a rigorous mathematical framework to describe scale variability and extensive experimental validation of the proposed algorithm. Furthermore, the algorithm's impact is evaluated across a broad spectrum of state-of-the-art unmixing algorithms on two synthetic and two real hyperspectral datasets. The proposed preprocessing step consistently improves the performance of these algorithms, including those specifically designed to handle spectral variability, with error reductions close to 50% in many cases. This demonstrates that scale correction acts as a complementary step, facilitating more accurate unmixing by existing methods. The algorithm's generality and significant impact highlight its potential as a key component in practical hyperspectral unmixing pipelines. The implementation code will be made publicly available upon publication.

Title: Tensor-Structured Bayesian Channel Prediction for Upper Mid-Band XL-MIMO Systems
Authors: Hongwei Hou, Yafei Wang, Xinping Yi, Wenjin Wang, Dirk T. M. Slock, Shi Jin
Abstract: The upper mid-band balances coverage and capacity for the future cellular systems and also embraces XL-MIMO systems, offering enhanced spectral and energy efficiency. However, these benefits are significantly degraded under mobility due to channel aging, and further exacerbated by the unique near-field (NF) and spatial non-stationarity (SnS) propagation in such systems. To address this challenge, we propose a novel channel prediction approach that incorporates dedicated channel modeling, probabilistic representations, and Bayesian inference algorithms for this emerging scenario. Specifically, we develop tensor-structured channel models in both the spatial-frequency-temporal (SFT) and beam-delay-Doppler (BDD) domains, which leverage temporal correlations among multiple pilot symbols for channel prediction. The factor matrices of multi-linear transformations are parameterized by BDD domain grids and SnS factors, where beam domain grids are jointly determined by angles and slopes under spatial-chirp based NF representations. To enable tractable inference, we replace environment-dependent BDD domain grids with uniformly sampled ones, and introduce perturbation parameters in each domain to mitigate grid mismatch. We further propose a hybrid beam domain strategy that integrates angle-only sampling with slope hyperparameterization to avoid the computational burden of explicit slope sampling. Based on the probabilistic models, we develop tensor-structured bi-layer inference (TS-BLI) algorithm under the expectation-maximization (EM) framework, which reduces computational complexity via tensor operations by leveraging the bi-layer factor graph for approximate E-step inference and an alternating strategy with closed-form updates in the M-step. Numerical simulations based on the near-practical channel simulator demonstrate the superior channel prediction performance of the proposed algorithm.

Title: An Analytical and Experimental Study of Distributed Uplink Beamforming in the Presence of Carrier Frequency Offsets
Authors: Mehdi Zafari, Divyanshu Pandey, Rahman Doost-Mohammady
Abstract: Realizing distributed multi-user beamforming (D-MUBF) in time division duplex (TDD)-based multi-user MIMO (MU-MIMO) systems faces significant challenges. One of the most fundamental challenges is achieving accurate over-the-air (OTA) timing and frequency synchronization among distributed access points (APs), particularly due to residual frequency offsets caused by local oscillator (LO) drifts. Despite decades of research on synchronization for MU-MIMO, there are only a few experimental studies that evaluate D-MUBF techniques under imperfect frequency synchronization among distributed antennas. This paper presents an analytical and experimental assessment of D-MUBF methods in the presence of frequency synchronization errors. We provide closed-form expressions for signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) as a function of channel characteristics and statistical properties of carrier frequency offset (CFO) among AP antennas. In addition, through experimental evaluations conducted with the RENEW massive MIMO testbed, we collected comprehensive datasets across various experimental scenarios. These datasets comprise uplink pilot samples for channel and CFO estimation, in addition to uplink multi-user data intended for analyzing D-MUBF techniques. By examining these datasets, we assess the performance of D-MUBF in the presence of CFO and compare the analytical predictions with empirical measurements. Furthermore, we make the datasets publicly available and provide insights on utilizing them for future research endeavors.

Title: Learning Zero Constellations for Binary MOCZ in Fading Channels
Authors: Anthony Joseph Perre, Parker Huggins, Alphan Sahin
Abstract: In this work, we propose two methods to design zero constellations for binary modulation on conjugate-reciprocal zeros (BMOCZ). In the first approach, we treat constellation design as a multi-label binary classification problem and learn the zero locations for a direct zero-testing (DiZeT) decoder. In the second approach, we introduce a neural network (NN)-based decoder and jointly learn the decoder and zero constellation parameters. We show that the NN-based decoder can directly generalize to flat-fading channels, despite being trained under additive white Gaussian noise. Furthermore, the results of numerical simulations demonstrate that learned zero constellations outperform the canonical, Huffman BMOCZ constellation, with the proposed NN-based decoder achieving large performance gain at the expense of increased computational complexity.

Title: DeePConverter: A Data-Driven Optimal Control Architecture for Grid-Connected Power Converters
Authors: Ruohan Leng, Linbin Huang, Huanhai Xin, Ping Ju, Xiongfei Wang, Eduardo Prieto-Araujo, Florian Dörfler
Abstract: Grid-connected power converters are ubiquitous in modern power systems, acting as grid interfaces of renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, high-voltage DC systems, etc. Conventionally, power converters use multiple PID regulators to achieve different control objectives such as grid synchronization and voltage/power regulations, where the PID parameters are usually tuned based on a presumed (and often overly-simplified) power grid model. However, this may lead to inferior performance or even instabilities in practice, as the real power grid is highly complex, variable, and generally unknown. To tackle this problem, we employ a data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) to perform data-driven, optimal, and robust control for power converters. We call the converters that are operated in this way \textit{DeePConverters}. A DeePConverter can implicitly perceive the characteristics of the power grid from data and adjust its control strategy to achieve optimal and robust performance. We present the modular configurations, generalized structure, control behavior specification, detailed implementation, and computation of DeePConverters. High-fidelity simulations and hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) tests are provided to validate the effectiveness of DeePConverters.

Authors: Yangui Fang, Jing Peng, Yu Xi, Xu Li, Haoyu Li, Chengwei Zhang, Guohui Zhong, Kai Yu
Abstract: Contextual speech recognition refers to the ability to identify preferences for specific content based on contextual information. Recently, leveraging the contextual understanding capabilities of Speech LLM to achieve contextual biasing by injecting contextual information through prompts have emerged as a research this http URL, the direct information injection method via prompts relies on the internal attention mechanism of the model, making it impossible to explicitly control the extent of information injection. To address this limitation, we propose a joint decoding method to control the contextual information. This approach enables explicit control over the injected contextual information and achieving superior recognition performance. Additionally, Our method can also be used for sensitive word suppression this http URL, experimental results show that even Speech LLM not pre-trained on long contextual data can acquire long contextual capabilities through our method.

Title: Biomedical Signal Processing: EEG and ECG Classification with Discrete Wavelet Transforms, Energy Distribution, and Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Justin London
Abstract: Biomedical signal processing extract meaningful information from physiological signals like electrocardiograms (ECGs), electroencephalograms (EEGs), and electromyograms (EMGs) to diagnose, monitor, and treat medical conditions and diseases such as seizures, cardiomyopathy, and neuromuscular disorders, respectively. Traditional manual physician analysis of electrical recordings is prone to human error as subtle anomolies may not be detected. Recently, advanced deep learning has significantly improved the accuracy of biomedical signal analysis. A multi-modal deep learning model is proposed that utilizes discrete wavelet transforms for signal pre-processing to reduce noise. A multi-modal image fusion and multimodal feature fusion framework is utilized that converts numeric biomedical signals into 2D and 3D images for image processing using Gramian angular fields, recurrency plots, and Markov transition fields. In this paper, deep learning models are applied to ECG, EEG, and human activity signals using actual medical datasets, brain, and heart recordings. The results demonstrate that using a multi-modal approach using wavelet transforms improves the accuracy of disease and disorder classification.

Title: Agentic Graph Neural Networks for Wireless Communications and Networking Towards Edge General Intelligence: A Survey
Authors: Yang Lu, Shengli Zhang, Chang Liu, Ruichen Zhang, Bo Ai, Dusit Niyato, Wei Ni, Xianbin Wang, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: The rapid advancement of communication technologies has driven the evolution of communication networks towards both high-dimensional resource utilization and multifunctional integration. This evolving complexity poses significant challenges in designing communication networks to satisfy the growing quality-of-service and time sensitivity of mobile applications in dynamic environments. Graph neural networks (GNNs) have emerged as fundamental deep learning (DL) models for complex communication networks. GNNs not only augment the extraction of features over network topologies but also enhance scalability and facilitate distributed computation. However, most existing GNNs follow a traditional passive learning framework, which may fail to meet the needs of increasingly diverse wireless systems. This survey proposes the employment of agentic artificial intelligence (AI) to organize and integrate GNNs, enabling scenario- and task-aware implementation towards edge general intelligence. To comprehend the full capability of GNNs, we holistically review recent applications of GNNs in wireless communications and networking. Specifically, we focus on the alignment between graph representations and network topologies, and between neural architectures and wireless tasks. We first provide an overview of GNNs based on prominent neural architectures, followed by the concept of agentic GNNs. Then, we summarize and compare GNN applications for conventional systems and emerging technologies, including physical, MAC, and network layer designs, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) and cell-free network architecture. We further propose a large language model (LLM) framework as an intelligent question-answering agent, leveraging this survey as a local knowledge base to enable GNN-related responses tailored to wireless communication research.

Title: XR Reality Check: What Commercial Devices Deliver for Spatial Tracking
Authors: Tianyi Hu, Tianyuan Du, Zhehan Qu, Maria Gorlatova
Abstract: Inaccurate spatial tracking in extended reality (XR) devices leads to virtual object jitter, misalignment, and user discomfort, fundamentally limiting immersive experiences and natural interactions. In this work, we introduce a novel testbed that enables simultaneous, synchronized evaluation of multiple XR devices under identical environmental and kinematic conditions. Leveraging this platform, we present the first comprehensive empirical benchmarking of five state-of-the-art XR devices across 16 diverse scenarios. Our results reveal substantial intra-device performance variation, with individual devices exhibiting up to 101\% increases in error when operating in featureless environments. We also demonstrate that tracking accuracy strongly correlates with visual conditions and motion dynamics. We also observe significant inter-device disparities, with performance differences of up to 2.8$\times$, which are closely linked to hardware specifications such as sensor configurations and dedicated processing units. Finally, we explore the feasibility of substituting a motion capture system with the Apple Vision Pro as a practical ground truth reference. While the Apple Vision Pro delivers highly accurate relative pose error estimates ($R^2 = 0.830$), its absolute pose error estimation remains limited ($R^2 = 0.387$), highlighting both its potential and its constraints for rigorous XR evaluation. This work establishes the first standardized framework for comparative XR tracking evaluation, providing the research community with reproducible methodologies, comprehensive benchmark datasets, and open-source tools that enable systematic analysis of tracking performance across devices and conditions, thereby accelerating the development of more robust spatial sensing technologies for XR systems.

Title: Sparse Near-Field Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO via Adaptive Filtering
Authors: Vidya Bhasker Shukla, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems operating at sub-THz carrier frequencies represent a promising solution to meet the demands of next-generation wireless applications. This work focuses on sparse channel estimation for XL-MIMO systems operating in the near-field (NF) regime. Assuming a practical subarray-based architecture, we develop a NF channel estimation framework based on adaptive filtering, referred to as \textit{polar-domain zero-attracting least mean squares (PD-ZALMS)}. The proposed method achieves significantly superior channel estimation accuracy and lower computational complexity compared with the well-established polar-domain orthogonal matching pursuit. In addition, the proposed PD-ZALMS is shown to outperform the oracle least-squares channel estimator at low-to-moderate signal-to-noise ratio.

Title: VQ-VAE Based Digital Semantic Communication with Importance-Aware OFDM Transmission
Authors: Ming Lyu, Hao Chen, Dan Wang, Chen Qiu, Guangyin Feng, Nan Ma, Xiaodong Xu
Abstract: Semantic communication (SemCom) significantly reduces redundant data and improves transmission efficiency by extracting the latent features of information. However, most of the conventional deep learning-based SemCom systems focus on analog transmission and lack in compatibility with practical digital communications. This paper proposes a vector quantized-variational autoencoder (VQ-VAE) based digital SemCom system that directly transmits the semantic features and incorporates the importance-aware orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) transmission to enhance the SemCom performance, where the VQ-VAE generates a discrete codebook shared between the transmitter and receiver. At transmitter, the latent semantic features are firstly extracted by VQ-VAE, and then the shared codebook is adopted to match these features, which are subsequently transformed into a discrete version to adapt the digital transmission. To protect the semantic information, an importance-aware OFDM transmission strategy is proposed to allocate the key features near the OFDM reference signals, where the feature importance is derived from the gradient-based method. At the receiver, the features are rematched with the shared codebook to further correct errors. Finally, experimental results demonstrate that our proposed scheme outperforms the conventional DeepSC and achieves better reconstruction performance under low SNR region.

Title: MultiAiTutor: Child-Friendly Educational Multilingual Speech Generation Tutor with LLMs
Authors: Xiaoxue Gao, Huayun Zhang, Nancy F. Chen
Abstract: Generative speech models have demonstrated significant potential in personalizing teacher-student interactions, offering valuable real-world applications for language learning in children's education. However, achieving high-quality, child-friendly speech generation remains challenging, particularly for low-resource languages across diverse languages and cultural contexts. In this paper, we propose MultiAiTutor, an educational multilingual generative AI tutor with child-friendly designs, leveraging LLM architecture for speech generation tailored for educational purposes. We propose to integrate age-appropriate multilingual speech generation using LLM architectures, facilitating young children's language learning through culturally relevant image-description tasks in three low-resource languages: Singaporean-accent Mandarin, Malay, and Tamil. Experimental results from both objective metrics and subjective evaluations demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed MultiAiTutor compared to baseline methods.

Title: Architecture and FPGA Implementation of Digital Time-to-Digital Converter for Sensing Applications
Authors: Zeinab Hijazi, Fatima Bzeih, Ali Ibrahim
Abstract: Many application domains face the challenges of high-power consumption and high computational demands, especially with the advancement in embedded machine learning and edge computing. Designing application-specific circuits is crucial to reducing hardware complexity and power consumption. In these perspectives, this paper presents the design of a Digital Time-to-Digital converter (DTDC) based on multiple delay line topologies. The DTDC is implemented in VHDL for the Xilinx Artix-7 AC701 FPGA device. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the circuit in converting the input period along a wide range up to 1ps.

Title: Evaluating Task Execution Performance Under Energy Measurement Overhead
Authors: Mateen Ashraf, Shahab Jahanbazi, Onel L. A. López
Abstract: Energy-awareness for adapting task execution behavior can bring several benefits in terms of performance improvement in energy harvesting (EH) Internet of Things (IoT) devices. However, the energy measurement cost of acquiring energy information, which is traditionally ignored, can potentially neutralize or even reverse the potential benefits. This paper highlights operational parameters, such as energy measurement frequency and task execution frequency, which can be tuned to improve the task execution performance of an EH-IoT device. To this end, we consider energy-blind (EB) and energy-aware (EA) task decision approaches and compare their task completion rate performance. We show that, for specific hardware design parameters of an EH-IoT device, there exists an optimal energy measurement/task execution frequency that can maximize the task completion rate in both approaches. Moreover, if these parameters are not chosen appropriately, then energy measurement costs can cause EA scheduling to underperform compared to EB scheduling.

Title: Wideband Coplanar Waveguide MIMO Antenna for 6G Millimeter-Wave Applications with Defected Ground Structure
Authors: Atta Ullah, Daniyal Munir, Daniel Lindenschmitt, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This research study introduces a novel small antenna with wideband capacity for the higher frequency range. As a possible contender for 6G wireless networks, the proposed antenna is designed to target the 6G Millimeter-Wave (mmWave) operating bands spanning 25 GHz to 33.5 GHz. With a microstrip patch structure fed by a coplanar waveguide (CPW) with the defected ground structure (DGS), a single antenna is introduced and then a design of 2 x 2 MIMO antenna is presented. The single antenna has 2 elements, while the 2 x 2 MIMO antenna has 8 elements. It achieves remarkably well in terms of return loss of 8.5 GHz wideband, which is anticipated to be used for several applications in 6G mmWave technology.

Title: Patient-Adaptive Focused Transmit Beamforming using Cognitive Ultrasound
Authors: Wessel L. van Nierop, Oisín Nolan, Tristan S.W. Stevens, Ruud J.G. van Sloun
Abstract: Focused transmit beamforming is the most commonly used acquisition scheme for echocardiograms, but suffers from relatively low frame rates, and in 3D, even lower volume rates. Fast imaging based on unfocused transmits has disadvantages such as motion decorrelation and limited harmonic imaging capabilities. This work introduces a patient-adaptive focused transmit scheme that has the ability to drastically reduce the number of transmits needed to produce a high-quality ultrasound image. The method relies on posterior sampling with a temporal diffusion model to perceive and reconstruct the anatomy based on partial observations, while subsequently taking an action to acquire the most informative transmits. This active perception modality outperforms random and equispaced subsampling on the 2D EchoNet-Dynamic dataset and a 3D Philips dataset, where we actively select focused elevation planes. Furthermore, we show it achieves better performance in terms of generalized contrast-to-noise ratio when compared to the same number of diverging waves transmits on three in-house echocardiograms. Additionally, we can estimate ejection fraction using only 2% of the total transmits and show that the method is robust to outlier patients. Finally, our method can be run in real-time on GPU accelerators from 2023. The code is publicly available at this https URL

Title: ReQuestNet: A Foundational Learning model for Channel Estimation
Authors: Kumar Pratik, Pouriya Sadeghi, Gabriele Cesa, Sanaz Barghi, Joseph B. Soriaga, Yuanning Yu, Supratik Bhattacharjee, Arash Behboodi
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel neural architecture for channel estimation (CE) in 5G and beyond, the Recurrent Equivariant UERS Estimation Network (ReQuestNet). It incorporates several practical considerations in wireless communication systems, such as ability to handle variable number of resource block (RB), dynamic number of transmit layers, physical resource block groups (PRGs) bundling size (BS), demodulation reference signal (DMRS) patterns with a single unified model, thereby, drastically simplifying the CE pipeline. Besides it addresses several limitations of the legacy linear MMSE solutions, for example, by being independent of other reference signals and particularly by jointly processing MIMO layers and differently precoded channels with unknown precoding at the receiver. ReQuestNet comprises of two sub-units, CoarseNet followed by RefinementNet. CoarseNet performs per PRG, per transmit-receive (Tx-Rx) stream channel estimation, while RefinementNet refines the CoarseNet channel estimate by incorporating correlations across differently precoded PRGs, and correlation across multiple input multiple output (MIMO) channel spatial dimensions (cross-MIMO). Simulation results demonstrate that ReQuestNet significantly outperforms genie minimum mean squared error (MMSE) CE across a wide range of channel conditions, delay-Doppler profiles, achieving up to 10dB gain at high SNRs. Notably, ReQuestNet generalizes effectively to unseen channel profiles, efficiently exploiting inter-PRG and cross-MIMO correlations under dynamic PRG BS and varying transmit layer allocations.

Title: Iterative Distortion Cancellation Algorithms for Single-Sideband Systems
Authors: Jun Dong, Tianwai Bo, Zhuo Wang, Haolei Gao, Zhongwei Tan, Yi Dong
Abstract: We propose an iterative distortion cancellation algorithm to digitally mitigate the impact of double-sideband dither signal amplitude from the automatic bias control module on Kramers-Kronig receivers without modifying physical layer structures. The algorithm utilizes the KK relation for initial signal decisions and reconstructs the distortion caused by dither signals. Experimental tests in back-to-back showed it improved tolerance to dither amplitudes up to 10% V{\pi}. For 80-km fiber transmission, the algorithm increased the receiver sensitivity by more than 1 dB, confirming the effectiveness of the proposed distortion cancellation method.

Title: Frequency-Assisted Adaptive Sharpening Scheme Considering Bitrate and Quality Tradeoff
Authors: Yingxue Pang, Shijie Zhao, Haiqiang Wang, Gen Zhan, Junlin Li, Li Zhang
Abstract: Sharpening is a widely adopted technique to improve video quality, which can effectively emphasize textures and alleviate blurring. However, increasing the sharpening level comes with a higher video bitrate, resulting in degraded Quality of Service (QoS). Furthermore, the video quality does not necessarily improve with increasing sharpening levels, leading to issues such as over-sharpening. Clearly, it is essential to figure out how to boost video quality with a proper sharpening level while also controlling bandwidth costs effectively. This paper thus proposes a novel Frequency-assisted Sharpening level Prediction model (FreqSP). We first label each video with the sharpening level correlating to the optimal bitrate and quality tradeoff as ground truth. Then taking uncompressed source videos as inputs, the proposed FreqSP leverages intricate CNN features and high-frequency components to estimate the optimal sharpening level. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Transient Noise Removal via Diffusion-based Speech Inpainting
Authors: Mordehay Moradi, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: In this paper, we present PGDI, a diffusion-based speech inpainting framework for restoring missing or severely corrupted speech segments. Unlike previous methods that struggle with speaker variability or long gap lengths, PGDI can accurately reconstruct gaps of up to one second in length while preserving speaker identity, prosody, and environmental factors such as reverberation. Central to this approach is classifier guidance, specifically phoneme-level guidance, which substantially improves reconstruction fidelity. PGDI operates in a speaker-independent manner and maintains robustness even when long segments are completely masked by strong transient noise, making it well-suited for real-world applications, such as fireworks, door slams, hammer strikes, and construction noise. Through extensive experiments across diverse speakers and gap lengths, we demonstrate PGDI's superior inpainting performance and its ability to handle challenging acoustic conditions. We consider both scenarios, with and without access to the transcript during inference, showing that while the availability of text further enhances performance, the model remains effective even in its absence.

Title: Trajectory-adaptive Beam Shaping: Towards Beam-Management-Free Near-field Communications
Authors: Sicong Ye, Yulan Gao, Ming Xiao, Peng Wang, Marios Poulakis, Ulrik Imberg
Abstract: The quest for higher wireless carrier frequencies spanning the millimeter-wave (mmWave) and Terahertz (THz) bands heralds substantial enhancements in data throughput and spectral efficiency for next-generation wireless networks. However, these gains come at the cost of severe path loss and a heightened risk of beam misalignment due to user mobility, especially pronounced in near-field communication. Traditional solutions rely on extremely directional beamforming and frequent beam updates via beam management, but such techniques impose formidable computational and signaling overhead. In response, we propose a novel approach termed trajectory-adaptive beam shaping (TABS) that eliminates the need for real-time beam management by shaping the electromagnetic wavefront to follow the user's predefined trajectory. Drawing inspiration from self-accelerating beams in optics, TABS concentrates energy along pre-defined curved paths corresponding to the user's motion without requiring real-time beam reconfiguration. We further introduce a dedicated quantitative metric to characterize performance under the TABS framework. Comprehensive simulations substantiate the superiority of TABS in terms of link performance, overhead reduction, and implementation complexity.

Title: EGGCodec: A Robust Neural Encodec Framework for EGG Reconstruction and F0 Extraction
Authors: Rui Feng, Yuang Chen, Yu Hu, Jun Du, Jiahong Yuan
Abstract: This letter introduces EGGCodec, a robust neural Encodec framework engineered for electroglottography (EGG) signal reconstruction and F0 extraction. We propose a multi-scale frequency-domain loss function to capture the nuanced relationship between original and reconstructed EGG signals, complemented by a time-domain correlation loss to improve generalization and accuracy. Unlike conventional Encodec models that extract F0 directly from features, EGGCodec leverages reconstructed EGG signals, which more closely correspond to F0. By removing the conventional GAN discriminator, we streamline EGGCodec's training process without compromising efficiency, incurring only negligible performance degradation. Trained on a widely used EGG-inclusive dataset, extensive evaluations demonstrate that EGGCodec outperforms state-of-the-art F0 extraction schemes, reducing mean absolute error (MAE) from 14.14 Hz to 13.69 Hz, and improving voicing decision error (VDE) by 38.2\%. Moreover, extensive ablation experiments validate the contribution of each component of EGGCodec.

Title: LPGNet: A Lightweight Network with Parallel Attention and Gated Fusion for Multimodal Emotion Recognition
Authors: Zhining He, Yang Xiao
Abstract: Emotion recognition in conversations (ERC) aims to predict the emotional state of each utterance by using multiple input types, such as text and audio. While Transformer-based models have shown strong performance in this task, they often face two major issues: high computational cost and heavy dependence on speaker information. These problems reduce their ability to generalize in real-world conversations. To solve these challenges, we propose LPGNet, a Lightweight network with Parallel attention and Gated fusion for multimodal ERC. The main part of LPGNet is the Lightweight Parallel Interaction Attention (LPIA) module. This module replaces traditional stacked Transformer layers with parallel dot-product attention, which can model both within-modality and between-modality relationships more efficiently. To improve emotional feature learning, LPGNet also uses a dual-gated fusion method. This method filters and combines features from different input types in a flexible and dynamic way. In addition, LPGNet removes speaker embeddings completely, which allows the model to work independently of speaker identity. Experiments on the IEMOCAP dataset show that LPGNet reaches over 87% accuracy and F1-score in 4-class emotion classification. It outperforms strong baseline models while using fewer parameters and showing better generalization across speakers.

Title: DeCRED: Decoder-Centric Regularization for Encoder-Decoder Based Speech Recognition
Authors: Alexander Polok, Santosh Kesiraju, Karel Beneš, Bolaji Yusuf, Lukáš Burget, Jan Černocký
Abstract: This paper presents a simple yet effective regularization for the internal language model induced by the decoder in encoder-decoder ASR models, thereby improving robustness and generalization in both in- and out-of-domain settings. The proposed method, Decoder-Centric Regularization in Encoder-Decoder (DeCRED), adds auxiliary classifiers to the decoder, enabling next token prediction via intermediate logits. Empirically, DeCRED reduces the mean internal LM BPE perplexity by 36.6% relative to 11 test sets. Furthermore, this translates into actual WER improvements over the baseline in 5 of 7 in-domain and 3 of 4 out-of-domain test sets, reducing macro WER from 6.4% to 6.3% and 18.2% to 16.2%, respectively. On TEDLIUM3, DeCRED achieves 7.0% WER, surpassing the baseline and encoder-centric InterCTC regularization by 0.6% and 0.5%, respectively. Finally, we compare DeCRED with OWSM v3.1 and Whisper-medium, showing competitive WERs despite training on much less data with fewer parameters.

Title: Listen through the Sound: Generative Speech Restoration Leveraging Acoustic Context Representation
Authors: Soo-Whan Chung, Min-Seok Choi
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to speech restoration by integrating a context-related conditioning strategy. Specifically, we employ the diffusion-based generative restoration model, UNIVERSE++, as a backbone to evaluate the effectiveness of contextual representations. We incorporate acoustic context embeddings extracted from the CLAP model, which capture the environmental attributes of input audio. Additionally, we propose an Acoustic Context (ACX) representation that refines CLAP embeddings to better handle various distortion factors and their intensity in speech signals. Unlike content-based approaches that rely on linguistic and speaker attributes, ACX provides contextual information that enables the restoration model to distinguish and mitigate distortions better. Experimental results indicate that context-aware conditioning improves both restoration performance and its stability across diverse distortion conditions, reducing variability compared to content-based methods.

Title: Selection of Layers from Self-supervised Learning Models for Predicting Mean-Opinion-Score of Speech
Authors: Xinyu Liang, Fredrik Cumlin, Victor Ungureanu, Chandan K. A. Reddy, Christian Schuldt, Saikat Chatterjee
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) models like Wav2Vec2, HuBERT, and WavLM have been widely used in speech processing. These transformer-based models consist of multiple layers, each capturing different levels of representation. While prior studies explored their layer-wise representations for efficiency and performance, speech quality assessment (SQA) models predominantly rely on last-layer features, leaving intermediate layers underexamined. In this work, we systematically evaluate different layers of multiple SSL models for predicting mean-opinion-score (MOS). Features from each layer are fed into a lightweight regression network to assess effectiveness. Our experiments consistently show early-layers features outperform or match those from the last layer, leading to significant improvements over conventional approaches and state-of-the-art MOS prediction models. These findings highlight the advantages of early-layer selection, offering enhanced performance and reduced system complexity.

Title: Scalable RIS-Aided Beamforming Strategies for Near-Field MU-MISO via Multi-Antenna Feeder
Authors: Giulia Torcolacci, Malte Schellmann, Davide Dardari
Abstract: This paper investigates a modular beamforming framework for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) communications in the near-field regime, built upon a novel antenna architecture integrating an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) array with a transmissive RIS (T-RIS), referred to as AT-RIS. This decoupling enables coordinated yet independently configurable designs in the AMAF and T-RIS domains, supporting flexible strategies with diverse complexity-performance trade-offs. Several implementations are analyzed, including diagonal and non-diagonal T-RIS architectures, paired with precoding schemes based on focusing, minimum mean square error, and eigenmode decomposition. Simulation results demonstrate that while non-diagonal schemes maximize sum rate in scenarios with a limited number of User Equipments (UEs) and high angular separability, they exhibit fairness and scalability limitations as UE density increases. Conversely, diagonal T-RIS configurations, particularly the proposed focusing-based scheme with uniform feeder-side power allocation, offer robust, fair, and scalable performance with minimal channel state information. The findings emphasize the critical impact of UEs' angular separability and reveal inherent trade-offs among spectral efficiency, complexity, and fairness, positioning diagonal AT-RIS architectures as practical solutions for scalable near-field MU multiple-input single-output systems.

Title: Improved SINR Approximation for Downlink SDMA-based Networks with Outdated Channel State Information
Authors: Maria Cecilia Fernández Montefiore, Gustavo González, F. Javier López-Martínez, Fernando Gregorio
Abstract: Understanding the performance of multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems under imperfect channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) remains a critical challenge in next-generation wireless networks. In this context, accurate statistical modeling of the signal-tointerference- plus-noise ratio (SINR) is essential for enabling tractable performance analysis of multi-user systems. This paper presents an improved statistical approximation of the SINR for downlink (DL) MU-MIMO systems with imperfect CSIT. The proposed model retains the analytical simplicity of existing approaches (e.g., Gamma-based approximations) while overcoming their limitations, particularly the underestimation of SINR variance. We evaluate the proposed approximation in the context of Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA)-enabled MIMO DL systems with outdated CSIT. The results demonstrate excellent accuracy across a wide range of system configurations, including varying

Title: Chartwin: a Case Study on Channel Charting-aided Localization in Dynamic Digital Network Twins
Authors: Lorenzo Cazzella, Francesco Linsalata, Mahdi Maleki, Damiano Badini, Matteo Matteucci, Umberto Spagnolini
Abstract: Wireless communication systems can significantly benefit from the availability of spatially consistent representations of the wireless channel to efficiently perform a wide range of communication tasks. Towards this purpose, channel charting has been introduced as an effective unsupervised learning technique to achieve both locally and globally consistent radio maps. In this letter, we propose Chartwin, a case study on the integration of localization-oriented channel charting with dynamic Digital Network Twins (DNTs). Numerical results showcase the significant performance of semi-supervised channel charting in constructing a spatially consistent chart of the considered extended urban environment. The considered method results in $\approx$ 4.5 m localization error for the static DNT and $\approx$ 6 m in the dynamic DNT, fostering DNT-aided channel charting and localization.

Title: A new dataset and comparison for multi-camera frame synthesis
Authors: Conall Daly, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: Many methods exist for frame synthesis in image sequences but can be broadly categorised into frame interpolation and view synthesis techniques. Fundamentally, both frame interpolation and view synthesis tackle the same task, interpolating a frame given surrounding frames in time or space. However, most frame interpolation datasets focus on temporal aspects with single cameras moving through time and space, while view synthesis datasets are typically biased toward stereoscopic depth estimation use cases. This makes direct comparison between view synthesis and frame interpolation methods challenging. In this paper, we develop a novel multi-camera dataset using a custom-built dense linear camera array to enable fair comparison between these approaches. We evaluate classical and deep learning frame interpolators against a view synthesis method (3D Gaussian Splatting) for the task of view in-betweening. Our results reveal that deep learning methods do not significantly outperform classical methods on real image data, with 3D Gaussian Splatting actually underperforming frame interpolators by as much as 3.5 dB PSNR. However, in synthetic scenes, the situation reverses -- 3D Gaussian Splatting outperforms frame interpolation algorithms by almost 5 dB PSNR at a 95% confidence level.

Title: Efficient motion-based metrics for video frame interpolation
Authors: Conall Daly, Darren Ramsook, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: Video frame interpolation (VFI) offers a way to generate intermediate frames between consecutive frames of a video sequence. Although the development of advanced frame interpolation algorithms has received increased attention in recent years, assessing the perceptual quality of interpolated content remains an ongoing area of research. In this paper, we investigate simple ways to process motion fields, with the purposes of using them as video quality metric for evaluating frame interpolation algorithms. We evaluate these quality metrics using the BVI-VFI dataset which contains perceptual scores measured for interpolated sequences. From our investigation we propose a motion metric based on measuring the divergence of motion fields. This metric correlates reasonably with these perceptual scores (PLCC=0.51) and is more computationally efficient (x2.7 speedup) compared to FloLPIPS (a well known motion-based metric). We then use our new proposed metrics to evaluate a range of state of the art frame interpolation metrics and find our metrics tend to favour more perceptual pleasing interpolated frames that may not score highly in terms of PSNR or SSIM.

Title: Smart Residential Community Simulator for Developing and Benchmarking Energy Management Systems
Authors: Ninad Gaikwad, Anamika Dubey
Abstract: Home Energy Management Systems (HEMS) are being actively developed for both individual houses and communities to support demand response in on-grid operation, and ensure resilience during off-grid scenarios. However, most simulators used for closed-loop HEMS testing are tailored to a specific distributed energy resource (DER) configuration with a fixed number of houses, limiting flexibility and scalability. This leads to additional development efforts to support diverse DER configurations across any number of houses and to integrate appropriate weather and load data pipelines. To address these limitations, we present a scalable simulator capable of modeling any number of houses in both on-grid and off-grid modes as a Gymnasium environment. Each house can have a unique DER configuration - Rooftop Solar Photovoltaics (PV), Battery-only, PV-only, or no DER - and includes models for air-conditioning and eight grouped circuit-level loads. The simulator integrates National Solar Radiation Database (NSRDB) weather and Pecan Street load datasets, supports three default controllers (two for off-grid, and one for on-grid scenarios), and includes performance metrics and visualization tools. We demonstrate its flexibility through simulations on individual houses and a four-house community with heterogeneous DERs, benchmarking the controllers across built-in metrics and computation time. The results highlight the simulator's capability to systematically evaluate control policy performance under varying system configurations.

Title: Spectral Efficiency Considerations for 6G
Authors: Joseph Boccuzzi
Abstract: As wireless connectivity continues to evolve towards 6G, there is an ever-increasing demand to not only deliver higher throughput, lower latency, and improved reliability, but also do so as efficiently as possible. To this point, the term efficiency has been quantified through applications to Spectral Efficiency (SE) and Energy Efficiency (EE). In this paper we introduce a new system metric called Radio Resource Utilization Efficiency (RUE). This metric quantifies the efficiency of the available radio resources (Spectrum, Access Method, Time Slots, Data Symbols, etc.) used to deliver future 6G demands. We compare the system performance of Typical Cellular and Cell-Free Massive MIMO deployments as a vehicle to demonstrate the need for this new metric. We begin by providing a concise treatment of items impacting SE by introducing three categories: 5G Radio Resources, Practical Limitations (such as channel matrix rank deficiency) and Implementation Losses (SINR degradation). For the example Radio Access Technology configuration analyzed, we show 5G yields an RUE of 47% (revealing significant room for improvement when defining 6G). Practical limitation assumptions are compared to 5G Multi-User MIMO (MU-MIMO) measurements conducted in a commercialized deployment. SE losses are characterized to offer guidance to advanced algorithms employing Machine Learning (ML) based techniques. We present the benefits of increasing the transmission Bandwidth (BW) from 100MHz to 1.6GHz. We describe a Next Generation RAN architecture that can support 6G and AI-RAN.

Authors: Ninad Gaikwad, Kunal Shankar, Anamika Dubey, Alan Love, Olvar Bergland
Abstract: We need computationally efficient and accurate building thermal dynamics models for use in grid-edge applications. This work evaluates two grey-box approaches for modeling building thermal dynamics: RC-network models and structured regression models. For RC-network models, we compare parameter estimation methods including Nonlinear Least Squares, Batch Estimation, and Maximum Likelihood Estimation. We use the Almon Lag Structure with Linear Least Squares for estimating the structured regression models. The performance of these models and methods is evaluated on simulated house and commercial building data across three different simulation types.

Title: A Review On Safe Reinforcement Learning Using Lyapunov and Barrier Functions
Authors: Dhruv S. Kushwaha, Zoleikha A. Biron
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL) has proven to be particularly effective in solving complex decision-making problems for a wide range of applications. From a control theory perspective, RL can be considered as an adaptive optimal control scheme. Lyapunov and barrier functions are the most commonly used certificates to guarantee system stability for a proposed/derived controller and constraint satisfaction guarantees, respectively, in control theoretic approaches. However, compared to theoretical guarantees available in control theoretic methods, RL lacks closed-loop stability of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction guarantees. Safe reinforcement learning refers to a class of constrained problems where the constraint violations lead to partial or complete system failure. The goal of this review is to provide an overview of safe RL techniques using Lyapunov and barrier functions to guarantee this notion of safety discussed (stability of the system in terms of a computed policy and constraint satisfaction during training and deployment). The different approaches employed are discussed in detail along with their shortcomings and benefits to provide critique and possible future research directions. Key motivation for this review is to discuss current theoretical approaches for safety and stability guarantees in RL similar to control theoretic approaches using Lyapunov and barrier functions. The review provides proven potential and promising scope of providing safety guarantees for complex dynamical systems with operational constraints using model-based and model-free RL.

Title: An Open-Source Simulation and Data Management Tool for EnergyPlus Building Models
Authors: Ninad Gaikwad, Kasey Dettlaff, Athul Jose P, Anamika Dubey
Abstract: We present a new open-source, GUI-based application created using Plotly-Dash, along with an integrated PostgreSQL-based relational database, developed to streamline EnergyPlus building model simulation workflows. The application facilitates data generation, aggregation (across thermal zones), and visualization based on customizable user preferences, while the database efficiently stores and retrieves complex simulation data generated by EnergyPlus. We demonstrate the need for this application and database, emphasizing how existing approaches for generating, managing, and analyzing EnergyPlus simulation data can be cumbersome, particularly when handling a large number of building models with varying simulation setups. This integrated framework enables building energy engineers and researchers to simplify their EnergyPlus simulations, manage generated simulation data, perform data analyses, and support data-driven modeling tasks.

Title: Binary Decision Process in Pre-Evacuation Behavior
Authors: Peng Wang, Peter Luh, Xuesong Lu
Abstract: In crowd evacuation the time interval before decisive movement towards a safe place is defined as the pre-evacuation phase, and it has crucial impact on the total time required to safe egress. This process mainly refers to situation awareness and response to an external stressors, e.g., fire alarm. Due to the complexity of human cognitive process, stimulation is widely used to study this important time interval. In this paper a binary decision process is formulated to simulate pre-evacuation time of many evacuees in a given social context. The model combines classic opinion dynamics with binary phase transition to describe how pre-evacuation time emerges from individual interaction. The model parameters are conceptually meaningful to human factors research within socio-psychological background, e.g., whether an individual is stubborn or open-minded, or what kind of the social topology exists among the individuals and how it matters in aggregating individuals into social groups. The modeling framework also describes collective motion of many evacuees in a planar space, and the resulting multi-agent system is partly similar to Vicsek model, and it is meaningful to explore complex crowd behavior in social context.

Title: Quantum Inspired Legal Tech Environmental Integration for Emergency Pharmaceutical Logistics with Entropy Modulated Collapse and Multilevel Governance
Authors: Ruicheng Li, Jingxu Wu
Abstract: Emergency pharmaceutical logistics during rapid-onset disasters must balance timeliness, legal compliance, and environmental uncertainty. We present a hybrid framework that co-designs quantum-inspired decision dynamics, embedded legal constraints, and blockchain-verified environmental feedback. Candidate routes are modeled as a superposed state whose collapse is governed by entropy modulation-delaying commitment under ambiguity and accelerating resolution when coherent signals emerge. Legal statutes act as real-time projection operators shaping feasible choices, while environmental decoherence cues adjust confidence and path viability. The core engine is situated within a multilevel governance and mechanism design architecture, establishing clear roles, accountability channels, and audit trails. Large-scale simulations in wildfire scenarios demonstrate substantial gains over conventional baselines in latency, compliance, and robustness, while preserving interpretability and fairness adaptation. The resulting system offers a deployable, governance-aware infrastructure where law and physical risk jointly inform emergency routing decisions.

Title: On Irreversibility and Stochastic Systems: Part One
Authors: Giorgio Picci
Abstract: We attempt to characterize irreversibility of a dynamical system from the existence of different forward and backward mathematical representations depending on the direction of the time arrow. Such different representations have been studied intensively and are shown to exist for stochastic diffusion models. In this setting one has however to face the preliminary justification of stochastic description for physical systems which are described by classical mechanics as inherently deterministic and conservative. In part one of this paper we first address this modeling problem for linear systems in a deterministic context. We show that forward-backward representations can also describe conservative finite dimensional deterministic systems when they are coupled to an infinite-dimensional conservative heat bath. A novel key observation is that the heat bath acts on the finite-dimensional conservative system by {\em state-feedback} and can shift its eigenvalues to make the system dissipative but may also generate another totally unstable model which naturally evolves backward in time. In the second part, we address the stochastic description of these two representations. Under a natural family of invariant measures the heat bath can be shown to induce a white noise input acting on the system making it look like a true dissipative diffusion.

Title: Stochastic Reconstruction of the Speed of Sound in Breast Ultrasound Computed Tomography with Phase Encoding in the Frequency Domain
Authors: Luca A. Forte
Abstract: The framework of ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) has recently re-emerged as a powerful, safe and operator-independent way to image the breast. State of the art image reconstruction methods are performed with iterative techniques based on deterministic optimization algorithms in the frequency domain in the 300 kHz - 1 MHz bandwidth. Alternative algorithms with deterministic and stochastic optimization have been considered in the time-domain. In this paper, we present the equivalent stochastic inversion in the frequency domain (phase encoding), with a focus on reconstructing the speed of sound. We test the inversion algorithm on synthetic data in 2D and 3D, by explicitly differentiating between inverse crime and non-inverse crime scenarios, and compare against the deterministic inversion. We then show the results of the stochastic inversion in the frequency domain on experimental data. By leveraging on the concepts of multiple super-shots and stochastic ensembles, we provide robust evidence that image quality of a stochastic reconstruction of the speed of sound with phase encoding in the frequency domain is comparable, and essentially equivalent, to the one of a deterministic reconstruction, with the further benefit of drastically reducing reconstruction times by more than half.

Title: Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement: Architectural Design and Deployment Strategies
Authors: Anis Hamadouche, Haifeng Luo, Mathini Sellathurai, Tharm Ratnarajah
Abstract: This paper introduces a new AI-based Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement (AVSE) system and presents a comparative performance analysis of different deployment architectures. The proposed AVSE system employs convolutional neural networks (CNNs) for spectral feature extraction and long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal modeling, enabling robust speech enhancement through multimodal fusion of audio and visual cues. Multiple deployment scenarios are investigated, including cloud-based, edge-assisted, and standalone device implementations. Their performance is evaluated in terms of speech quality improvement, latency, and computational overhead. Real-world experiments are conducted across various network conditions, including Ethernet, Wi-Fi, 4G, and 5G, to analyze the trade-offs between processing delay, communication latency, and perceptual speech quality. The results show that while cloud deployment achieves the highest enhancement quality, edge-assisted architectures offer the best balance between latency and intelligibility, meeting real-time requirements under 5G and Wi-Fi 6 conditions. These findings provide practical guidelines for selecting and optimizing AVSE deployment architectures in diverse applications, including assistive hearing devices, telepresence, and industrial communications.

Title: Gradient- and Newton-Based Unit Vector Extremum Seeking Control
Authors: Roberto Luo, Victor Hugo Pereira Rodrigues, Tiago Roux Oliveira, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: This paper presents novel methods for achieving stable and efficient convergence in multivariable extremum seeking control (ESC) using sliding mode techniques. Drawing inspiration from both classical sliding mode control and more recent developments in finite-time and fixed-time control, we propose a new framework that integrates these concepts into Gradient- and Newton-based ESC schemes based on sinusoidal perturbation signals. The key innovation lies in the use of discontinuous "relay-type" control components, replacing traditional proportional feedback to estimate the gradient of unknown quadratic nonlinear performance maps with Unit Vector Control (UVC). This represents the first attempt to address real-time, model-free optimization using sliding modes within the classical extremum seeking paradigm. In the Gradient-based approach, the convergence rate is influenced by the unknown Hessian of the objective function. In contrast, the Newton-based method overcomes this limitation by employing a dynamic estimator for the inverse of the Hessian, implemented via a Riccati equation filter. We establish finite-time convergence of the closed-loop average system to the extremum point for both methods by leveraging Lyapunov-based analysis and averaging theory tailored to systems with discontinuous right-hand sides. Numerical simulations validate the proposed method, illustrating significantly faster convergence and improved robustness compared to conventional ESC strategies, which typically guarantee only exponential stability. The results also demonstrate that the Gradient-based method exhibits slower convergence and higher transients since the gradient trajectory follows the curved and steepest-descent path, whereas the Newton-based method achieves faster convergence and improved overall performance going straightly to the extremum.

Title: Control-affine Schrödinger Bridge and Generalized Bohm Potential
Authors: Alexis M.H. Teter, Abhishek Halder, Michael D. Schneider, Alexx S. Perloff, Jane Pratt, Conor M. Artman, Maria Demireva
Abstract: The control-affine Schrödinger bridge concerns with a stochastic optimal control problem. Its solution is a controlled evolution of joint state probability density subject to a control-affine Itô diffusion with a given deadline connecting a given pair of initial and terminal densities. In this work, we recast the necessary conditions of optimality for the control-affine Schrödinger bridge problem as a two point boundary value problem for a quantum mechanical Schrödinger PDE with complex potential. This complex-valued potential is a generalization of the real-valued Bohm potential in quantum mechanics. Our derived potential is akin to the optical potential in nuclear physics where the real part of the potential encodes elastic scattering (transmission of wave function), and the imaginary part encodes inelastic scattering (absorption of wave function). The key takeaway is that the process noise that drives the evolution of probability densities induces an absorbing medium in the evolution of wave function. These results make new connections between control theory and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics through the lens of quantum mechanics.

Title: RealisMotion: Decomposed Human Motion Control and Video Generation in the World Space
Authors: Jingyun Liang, Jingkai Zhou, Shikai Li, Chenjie Cao, Lei Sun, Yichen Qian, Weihua Chen, Fan Wang
Abstract: Generating human videos with realistic and controllable motions is a challenging task. While existing methods can generate visually compelling videos, they lack separate control over four key video elements: foreground subject, background video, human trajectory and action patterns. In this paper, we propose a decomposed human motion control and video generation framework that explicitly decouples motion from appearance, subject from background, and action from trajectory, enabling flexible mix-and-match composition of these elements. Concretely, we first build a ground-aware 3D world coordinate system and perform motion editing directly in the 3D space. Trajectory control is implemented by unprojecting edited 2D trajectories into 3D with focal-length calibration and coordinate transformation, followed by speed alignment and orientation adjustment; actions are supplied by a motion bank or generated via text-to-motion methods. Then, based on modern text-to-video diffusion transformer models, we inject the subject as tokens for full attention, concatenate the background along the channel dimension, and add motion (trajectory and action) control signals by addition. Such a design opens up the possibility for us to generate realistic videos of anyone doing anything anywhere. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets and real-world cases demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on both element-wise controllability and overall video quality.

Title: Performance Benchmarking of Machine Learning Models for Terahertz Metamaterial Absorber Prediction
Authors: Nafisa Anjum, Robiul Hasan
Abstract: This study presents a polarization-insensitive ultra-broadband terahertz metamaterial absorber based on vanadium dioxide (VO2) and evaluates machine learning methods for predicting its absorption performance. The structure consists of a VO2 metasurface, a MF2 dielectric spacer, and a gold ground plane. It achieves more than 90% absorption between 5.72 and 11.11 THz, covering a 5.38 THz bandwidth with an average absorptance of 98.15%. A dataset of 9,018 samples was generated from full-wave simulations by varying patch width, dielectric thickness, and frequency. Six regression models were trained: Linear Regression, Support Vector Regression, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Bagging. Performance was measured using adjusted R2, MAE, MSE, and RMSE. Ensemble models achieved the best results, with Bagging reaching an adjusted R2 of 0.9985 and RMSE of 0.0146. The workflow offers a faster alternative to exhaustive simulations and can be applied to other metamaterial designs, enabling efficient evaluation and optimization.

Abstract: We consider the monotonic tracking control problem for continuous-time single-input single-output linear systems using output-feedback linear controllers in this paper. We provide the necessary and sufficient conditions for this problem to be solvable and expose its fundamental limitations: the exact feasible locations of the plant zeros, the minimum controller order possible, and the maximum decay rate achievable for the closed-loop system. The relationship between these bounds is explained by a simple geometric shape for plants with a pair of complex-conjugate zeros.

Title: DualSpeechLM: Towards Unified Speech Understanding and Generation via Dual Speech Token Modeling with Large Language Models
Authors: Yuanyuan Wang, Dongchao Yang, Yiwen Shao, Hangting Chen, Jiankun Zhao, Zhiyong Wu, Helen Meng, Xixin Wu
Abstract: Extending pre-trained Large Language Models (LLMs)'s speech understanding or generation abilities by introducing various effective speech tokens has attracted great attention in the speech community. However, building a unified speech understanding and generation model still faces the following challenges: (1) Due to the huge modality gap between speech tokens and text tokens, extending text LLMs to unified speech LLMs relies on large-scale paired data for fine-tuning, and (2) Generation and understanding tasks prefer information at different levels, e.g., generation benefits from detailed acoustic features, while understanding favors high-level semantics. This divergence leads to difficult performance optimization in one unified model. To solve these challenges, in this paper, we present two key insights in speech tokenization and speech language modeling. Specifically, we first propose an Understanding-driven Speech Tokenizer (USTokenizer), which extracts high-level semantic information essential for accomplishing understanding tasks using text LLMs. In this way, USToken enjoys better modality commonality with text, which reduces the difficulty of modality alignment in adapting text LLMs to speech LLMs. Secondly, we present DualSpeechLM, a dual-token modeling framework that concurrently models USToken as input and acoustic token as output within a unified, end-to-end framework, seamlessly integrating speech understanding and generation capabilities. Furthermore, we propose a novel semantic supervision loss and a Chain-of-Condition (CoC) strategy to stabilize model training and enhance speech generation performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed approach effectively fosters a complementary relationship between understanding and generation tasks, highlighting the promising strategy of mutually enhancing both tasks in one unified model.

Title: Large Scale Robotic Material Handling: Learning, Planning, and Control
Authors: Filippo A. Spinelli, Yifan Zhai, Fang Nan, Pascal Egli, Julian Nubert, Thilo Bleumer, Lukas Miller, Ferdinand Hofmann, Marco Hutter
Abstract: Bulk material handling involves the efficient and precise moving of large quantities of materials, a core operation in many industries, including cargo ship unloading, waste sorting, construction, and demolition. These repetitive, labor-intensive, and safety-critical operations are typically performed using large hydraulic material handlers equipped with underactuated grippers. In this work, we present a comprehensive framework for the autonomous execution of large-scale material handling tasks. The system integrates specialized modules for environment perception, pile attack point selection, path planning, and motion control. The main contributions of this work are two reinforcement learning-based modules: an attack point planner that selects optimal grasping locations on the material pile to maximize removal efficiency and minimize the number of scoops, and a robust trajectory following controller that addresses the precision and safety challenges associated with underactuated grippers in movement, while utilizing their free-swinging nature to release material through dynamic throwing. We validate our framework through real-world experiments on a 40 t material handler in a representative worksite, focusing on two key tasks: high-throughput bulk pile management and high-precision truck loading. Comparative evaluations against human operators demonstrate the system's effectiveness in terms of precision, repeatability, and operational safety. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first complete automation of material handling tasks on a full scale.

Title: Optimization-Free Fast Optimal Control: Bang-Ride Property, Monotonicity, and Applications to Fast Battery Charging
Authors: Shengling Shi, Jacob Sass, Jiaen Wu, Minsu Kim, Yingjie Ma, Sungho Shin, Richard D. Braatz
Abstract: Single-input fast optimal control problems, which aim to achieve the optimal objective as fast as possible, occur in various real-world applications. In the case of fast battery charging, the associated optimal control problem becomes computationally challenging when detailed battery models are used. A recent heuristic optimization-free algorithm can significantly reduce the computational cost and provide an approximate solution, consistent with many heuristic input profiles in practice. These heuristic solutions have several special properties: They follow a bang-ride pattern that always activates a constraint and applies the maximum feasible input. This work investigates when the above properties arise in the optimal input, and ultimately, when the heuristic input profiles satisfy necessary optimality conditions. By exploiting Pontryagin's maximum principle (PMP), we show that the optimal control is bang-ride under regularity conditions on constraint switching and local controllability of the system. Moreover, the special type of bang-ride behavior, i.e., applying the maximum feasible input, arises under the monotonicity of the system, objective function, and restricted sensitivity of the constraints. These results provide a theoretical justification for a class of charging heuristics and the fast optimization-free algorithm.

Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) have an increasingly important role in preventing exploitation of network vulnerabilities by malicious actors. Recent deep learning based developments have resulted in significant improvements in the performance of IDS systems. In this paper, we present FetFIDS, where we explore the employment of feature embedding instead of positional embedding to improve intrusion detection performance of a transformer based deep learning system. Our model is developed with the aim of deployments in edge learning scenarios, where federated learning over multiple communication rounds can ensure both privacy and localized performance improvements. FetFIDS outperforms multiple state-of-the-art intrusion detection systems in a federated environment and demonstrates a high degree of suitability to federated learning.

Title: Developing a Transferable Federated Network Intrusion Detection System
Authors: Abu Shafin Mohammad Mahdee Jameel, Shreya Ghosh, Aly El Gamal
Abstract: Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) are a vital part of a network-connected device. In this paper, we develop a deep learning based intrusion detection system that is deployed in a distributed setup across devices connected to a network. Our aim is to better equip deep learning models against unknown attacks using knowledge from known attacks. To this end, we develop algorithms to maximize the number of transferability relationships. We propose a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model, along with two algorithms that maximize the number of relationships observed. One is a two step data pre-processing stage, and the other is a Block-Based Smart Aggregation (BBSA) algorithm. The proposed system succeeds in achieving superior transferability performance while maintaining impressive local detection rates. We also show that our method is generalizable, exhibiting transferability potential across datasets and even with different backbones. The code for this work can be found at this https URL.

Title: Neutone SDK: An Open Source Framework for Neural Audio Processing
Authors: Christopher Mitcheltree, Bogdan Teleaga, Andrew Fyfe, Naotake Masuda, Matthias Schäfer, Alfie Bradic, Nao Tokui
Abstract: Neural audio processing has unlocked novel methods of sound transformation and synthesis, yet integrating deep learning models into digital audio workstations (DAWs) remains challenging due to real-time / neural network inference constraints and the complexities of plugin development. In this paper, we introduce the Neutone SDK: an open source framework that streamlines the deployment of PyTorch-based neural audio models for both real-time and offline applications. By encapsulating common challenges such as variable buffer sizes, sample rate conversion, delay compensation, and control parameter handling within a unified, model-agnostic interface, our framework enables seamless interoperability between neural models and host plugins while allowing users to work entirely in Python. We provide a technical overview of the interfaces needed to accomplish this, as well as the corresponding SDK implementations. We also demonstrate the SDK's versatility across applications such as audio effect emulation, timbre transfer, and sample generation, as well as its adoption by researchers, educators, companies, and artists alike. The Neutone SDK is available at this https URL

Title: A Data-driven Loss Weighting Scheme across Heterogeneous Tasks for Image Denoising
Authors: Xiangyu Rui, Xiangyong Cao, Xile Zhao, Deyu Meng, Michael K. NG
Abstract: In a variational denoising model, weight in the data fidelity term plays the role of enhancing the noise-removal capability. It is profoundly correlated with noise information, while also balancing the data fidelity and regularization terms. However, the difficulty of assigning weight is expected to be substantial when the noise pattern is beyond independent identical Gaussian distribution, e.g., impulse noise, stripe noise, or a mixture of several patterns, etc. Furthermore, how to leverage weight to balance the data fidelity and regularization terms is even less evident. In this work, we propose a data-driven loss weighting (DLW) scheme to address these issues. Specifically, DLW trains a parameterized weight function (i.e., a neural network) that maps the noisy image to the weight. The training is achieved by a bilevel optimization framework, where the lower level problem is solving several denoising models with the same weight predicted by the weight function and the upper level problem minimizes the distance between the restored image and the clean image. In this way, information from both the noise and the regularization can be efficiently extracted to determine the weight function. DLW also facilitates the easy implementation of a trained weight function on denoising models. Numerical results verify the remarkable performance of DLW on improving the ability of various variational denoising models to handle different complex noise. This implies that DLW has the ability to transfer the noise knowledge at the model level to heterogeneous tasks beyond the training ones and the generalization theory underlying DLW is studied, validating its intrinsic transferability.

Abstract: Accurate trajectory prediction (TP) for climbing aircraft is hampered by the presence of epistemic uncertainties concerning aircraft operation, which can lead to significant misspecification between predicted and observed trajectories. This paper proposes a generative model for climbing aircraft in which the standard Base of Aircraft Data (BADA) model is enriched by a functional correction to the thrust that is learned from data. The method offers three features: predictions of the arrival time with 26.7% less error when compared to BADA; generated trajectories that are realistic when compared to test data; and a means of computing confidence bounds for minimal computational cost.

Title: Style transfer between Microscopy and Magnetic Resonance Imaging via Generative Adversarial Network in small sample size settings
Authors: Monika Pytlarz, Adrian Onicas, Alessandro Crimi
Abstract: Cross-modal augmentation of Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) and microscopic imaging based on the same tissue samples is promising because it can allow histopathological analysis in the absence of an underlying invasive biopsy procedure. Here, we tested a method for generating microscopic histological images from MRI scans of the human corpus callosum using conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) architecture. To our knowledge, this is the first multimodal translation of the brain MRI to histological volumetric representation of the same sample. The technique was assessed by training paired image translation models taking sets of images from MRI scans and microscopy. The use of cGAN for this purpose is challenging because microscopy images are large in size and typically have low sample availability. The current work demonstrates that the framework reliably synthesizes histology images from MRI scans of corpus callosum, emphasizing the network's ability to train on high resolution histologies paired with relatively lower-resolution MRI scans. With the ultimate goal of avoiding biopsies, the proposed tool can be used for educational purposes.

Title: VisionUnite: A Vision-Language Foundation Model for Ophthalmology Enhanced with Clinical Knowledge
Authors: Zihan Li, Diping Song, Zefeng Yang, Deming Wang, Fei Li, Xiulan Zhang, Paul E. Kinahan, Yu Qiao
Abstract: The need for improved diagnostic methods in ophthalmology is acute, especially in the underdeveloped regions with limited access to specialists and advanced equipment. Therefore, we introduce VisionUnite, a novel vision-language foundation model for ophthalmology enhanced with clinical knowledge. VisionUnite has been pretrained on an extensive dataset comprising 1.24 million image-text pairs, and further refined using our proposed MMFundus dataset, which includes 296,379 high-quality fundus image-text pairs and 889,137 simulated doctor-patient dialogue instances. Our experiments indicate that VisionUnite outperforms existing generative foundation models such as GPT-4V and Gemini Pro. It also demonstrates diagnostic capabilities comparable to junior ophthalmologists. VisionUnite performs well in various clinical scenarios including open-ended multi-disease diagnosis, clinical explanation, and patient interaction, making it a highly versatile tool for initial ophthalmic disease screening. VisionUnite can also serve as an educational aid for junior ophthalmologists, accelerating their acquisition of knowledge regarding both common and underrepresented ophthalmic conditions. VisionUnite represents a significant advancement in ophthalmology, with broad implications for diagnostics, medical education, and understanding of disease mechanisms.

Title: A Radio Map Approach for Reduced Pilot CSI Tracking in Massive MIMO Networks
Authors: Yuanshuai Zheng, Junting Chen
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems offer significant potential to enhance wireless communication performance, yet accurate and timely channel state information (CSI) acquisition remains a key challenge. Existing works on CSI estimation and radio map applications typically rely on stationary CSI statistics and accurate location labels. However, the CSI process can be discontinuous due to user mobility and environmental variations, and inaccurate location data can degrade the performance. By contrast, this paper studies radio-map-embedded CSI tracking and radio map construction without the assumptions of stationary CSI statistics and precise location labels. Using radio maps as the prior information, this paper develops a radio-map-embedded switching Kalman filter (SKF) framework that jointly tracks the location and the CSI with adaptive beamforming for sparse CSI observations under reduced pilots. For radio map construction without precise location labels, the location sequence and the channel covariance matrices are jointly estimated based on a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). An unbiased estimator on the channel covariance matrix is found. Numerical results on ray-traced MIMO channel datasets demonstrate that using 1 pilot in every 10 milliseconds, an average of over 97% of capacity over that of perfect CSI can be achieved, while a conventional Kalman filter (KF) can only achieve 76%. Furthermore, the proposed radio-map-embedded CSI model can reduce the localization error from 30 meters from the prior to 6 meters for radio map construction.

Title: Adaptive Informed Deep Neural Networks for Power Flow Analysis
Authors: Zeynab Kaseb, Stavros Orfanoudakis, Pedro P. Vergara, Peter Palensky
Abstract: This study introduces PINN4PF, an end-to-end deep learning architecture for power flow (PF) analysis that effectively captures the nonlinear dynamics of large-scale modern power systems. The proposed neural network (NN) architecture consists of two important advancements in the training pipeline: (A) a double-head feed-forward NN that aligns with PF analysis, including an activation function that adjusts to the net active and reactive power injections patterns, and (B) a physics-based loss function that partially incorporates power system topology information through a novel hidden function. The effectiveness of the proposed architecture is illustrated through 4-bus, 15-bus, 290-bus, and 2224-bus test systems and is evaluated against two baselines: a linear regression model (LR) and a black-box NN (MLP). The comparison is based on (i) generalization ability, (ii) robustness, (iii) impact of training dataset size on generalization ability, (iv) accuracy in approximating derived PF quantities (specifically line current, line active power, and line reactive power), and (v) scalability. Results demonstrate that PINN4PF outperforms both baselines across all test systems by up to two orders of magnitude not only in terms of direct criteria, e.g., generalization ability, but also in terms of approximating derived physical quantities.

Title: Optimal Coupled Sensor Placement and Path-Planning in Unknown Time-Varying Environments
Authors: Prakash Poudel, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi
Abstract: We address path-planning for a mobile agent to navigate in an unknown environment with minimum exposure to a spatially and temporally varying threat field. The threat field is estimated using pointwise noisy measurements from a mobile sensor network. For this problem, we present a new information gain measure for optimal sensor placement that quantifies reduction in uncertainty in the path cost rather than the environment state. This measure, which we call the context-relevant mutual information (CRMI), couples the sensor placement and path-planning problem. We propose an iterative coupled sensor configuration and path-planning (CSCP) algorithm. At each iteration, this algorithm places sensors to maximize CRMI, updates the threat estimate using new measurements, and recalculates the path with minimum expected exposure to the threat. The iterations converge when the path cost variance, which is an indicator of risk, reduces below a desired threshold. We show that CRMI is submodular, and therefore, greedy optimization provides near-optimal sensor placements while maintaining computational efficiency of the CSCP algorithm. Distance-based sensor reconfiguration costs are introduced in a modified CRMI measure, which we also show to be submodular. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the principal advantage of this algorithm is that near-optimal low-variance paths are achieved using far fewer sensor measurements as compared to a standard sensor placement method.

Title: Data-Driven Certificate Synthesis
Authors: Luke Rickard, Alessandro Abate, Kostas Margellos
Abstract: We investigate the problem of verifying different properties of discrete time dynamical systems, namely, reachability, safety and reach-while-avoid. To achieve this, we adopt a data driven perspective and, using past system trajectories as data, we aim at learning a specific function termed certificate for each property we wish to verify. We seek to minimize a loss function, designed to encompass conditions on the certificate to be learned that encode the satisfaction of the associated property. Besides learning a certificate, we quantify probabilistically its generalization properties, namely, how likely it is for a certificate to be valid (and hence for the associated property to be satisfied) when it comes to a new system trajectory not included in the training data set. We view this problem under the realm of probably approximately correct (PAC) learning under the notion of compression, and use recent advancements of the so-called scenario approach to obtain scalable generalization bounds on the learned certificates. To achieve this, we design a novel algorithm that minimizes the loss function and hence constructs a certificate, and at the same time determines a quantity termed compression, which is instrumental in obtaining meaningful probabilistic guarantees. This process is novel per se and provides a constructive mechanism for compression set calculation, thus opening the road for its use to more general non-convex optimization problems. We verify the efficacy of our methodology on several numerical case studies, and compare it (both theoretically and numerically) with closely related results on data-driven property verification.

Title: Automated Muscle and Fat Segmentation in Computed Tomography for Comprehensive Body Composition Analysis
Authors: Yaqian Chen, Hanxue Gu, Yuwen Chen, Jichen Yang, Haoyu Dong, Joseph Y. Cao, Adrian Camarena, Christopher Mantyh, Roy Colglazier, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Body composition assessment using CT images can potentially be used for a number of clinical applications, including the prognostication of cardiovascular outcomes, evaluation of metabolic health, monitoring of disease progression, assessment of nutritional status, prediction of treatment response in oncology, and risk stratification for surgical and critical care outcomes. While multiple groups have developed in-house segmentation tools for this analysis, there are very limited publicly available tools that could be consistently used across different applications. To mitigate this gap, we present a publicly accessible, end-to-end segmentation and feature calculation model specifically for CT body composition analysis. Our model performs segmentation of skeletal muscle, subcutaneous adipose tissue (SAT), and visceral adipose tissue (VAT) across the chest, abdomen, and pelvis area in axial CT images. It also provides various body composition metrics, including muscle density, visceral-to-subcutaneous fat (VAT/SAT) ratio, muscle area/volume, and skeletal muscle index (SMI), supporting both 2D and 3D assessments. To evaluate the model, the segmentation was applied to both internal and external datasets, with body composition metrics analyzed across different age, sex, and race groups. The model achieved high dice coefficients on both internal and external datasets, exceeding 89% for skeletal muscle, SAT, and VAT segmentation. The model outperforms the benchmark by 2.40% on skeletal muscle and 10.26% on SAT compared to the manual annotations given by the publicly available dataset. Body composition metrics show mean relative absolute errors (MRAEs) under 10% for all measures. Furthermore, the model provided muscular fat segmentation with a Dice coefficient of 56.27%, which can be utilized for additional analyses as needed.

Title: Task-Oriented Feature Compression for Multimodal Understanding via Device-Edge Co-Inference
Authors: Cheng Yuan, Zhening Liu, Jiashu Lv, Jiawei Shao, Yufei Jiang, Jun Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: With the rapid development of large multimodal models (LMMs), multimodal understanding applications are emerging. As most LMM inference requests originate from edge devices with limited computational capabilities, the predominant inference pipeline involves directly forwarding the input data to an edge server which handles all computations. However, this approach introduces high transmission latency due to limited uplink bandwidth of edge devices and significant computation latency caused by the prohibitive number of visual tokens, thus hindering delay-sensitive tasks and degrading user experience. To address this challenge, we propose a task-oriented feature compression (TOFC) method for multimodal understanding in a device-edge co-inference framework, where visual features are merged by clustering and encoded by a learnable and selective entropy model before feature projection. Specifically, we employ density peaks clustering based on K nearest neighbors to reduce the number of visual features, thereby minimizing both data transmission and computational complexity. Subsequently, a learnable entropy model with hyperprior is utilized to encode and decode merged features, further reducing transmission overhead. To enhance compression efficiency, multiple entropy models are adaptively selected based on the characteristics of the visual features, enabling a more accurate estimation of the probability distribution. Comprehensive experiments on seven visual question answering benchmarks validate the effectiveness of the proposed TOFC method. Results show that TOFC achieves up to 52% reduction in data transmission overhead and 63% reduction in system latency while maintaining identical task performance, compared with neural compression ELIC.

Title: Impedance Space Method: Time-Independent Parametric Ellipses for Robot Compliant Control
Authors: Leonardo F. Dos Santos (1), Cícero Zanette (1), Elisa G. Vergamini (1), Lucca Maitan (1), Thiago Boaventura (1) ((1) São Carlos School of Engineering - University of São Paulo)
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel 3D graphical representation for impedance control, called the impedance space, to foster the analysis of the dynamic behavior of robotic compliant controllers. The method overcomes limitations of existing 2D graphical approaches by incorporating mass, stiffness, and damping dynamics, and associates the impedance control parameters with linear transformations to plot a parametric 3D ellipse and its projections in 2D for a mass-spring-damper impedance under sinusoidal reference. Experimental evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed representation for analysis of impedance control. The method applies to various compliant control topologies and can be extended to other model-based control approaches.

Title: On Composable and Parametric Uncertainty in Systems Co-Design
Authors: Yujun Huang, Marius Furter, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Optimizing the design of complex systems requires navigating interdependent decisions, heterogeneous components, and multiple objectives. Our monotone theory of co-design offers a compositional framework for addressing this challenge, modeling systems as Design Problems (DPs), representing trade-offs between functionalities and resources within partially ordered sets. While current approaches model uncertainty using intervals, capturing worst- and best-case bounds, they fail to express probabilistic notions such as risk and confidence. These limitations hinder the applicability of co-design in domains where uncertainty plays a critical role. In this paper, we introduce a unified framework for composable uncertainty in co-design, capturing intervals, distributions, and parametrized models. This extension enables reasoning about risk-performance trade-offs and supports advanced queries such as experiment design, learning, and multi-stage decision making. We demonstrate the expressiveness and utility of the framework via a numerical case study on the uncertainty-aware co-design of task-driven Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs).

Title: Aligning Beam with Imbalanced Multi-modality: A Generative Federated Learning Approach
Authors: Jiahui Liang, Miaowen Wen, Shuoyao Wang, Yuxuan Liang, Shijian Gao
Abstract: As vehicle intelligence advances, multi-modal sensing-aided communication emerges as a key enabler for reliable Vehicle-to-Everything (V2X) connectivity through precise environmental characterization. As centralized learning may suffer from data privacy, model heterogeneity and communication overhead issues, federated learning (FL) has been introduced to support V2X. However, the practical deployment of FL faces critical challenges: model performance degradation from label imbalance across vehicles and training instability induced by modality disparities in sensor-equipped agents. To overcome these limitations, we propose a generative FL approach for beam selection (GFL4BS). Our solution features two core innovations: 1) An adaptive zero-shot multi-modal generator coupled with spectral-regularized loss functions to enhance the expressiveness of synthetic data compensating for both label scarcity and missing modalities; 2) A hybrid training paradigm integrating feature fusion with decentralized optimization to ensure training resilience while minimizing communication costs. Experimental evaluations demonstrate significant improvements over baselines achieving 16.2% higher accuracy than the current state-of-the-art under severe label imbalance conditions while maintaining over 70% successful rate even when two agents lack both LiDAR and RGB camera inputs.

Title: PC-SRGAN: Physically Consistent Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network for General Transient Simulations
Authors: Md Rakibul Hasan, Pouria Behnoudfar, Dan MacKinlay, Thomas Poulet
Abstract: Machine Learning, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), has revolutionised Super-Resolution (SR). However, generated images often lack physical meaningfulness, which is essential for scientific applications. Our approach, PC-SRGAN, enhances image resolution while ensuring physical consistency for interpretable simulations. PC-SRGAN significantly improves both the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio and the Structural Similarity Index Measure compared to conventional SR methods, even with limited training data (e.g., only 13% of training data is required to achieve performance similar to SRGAN). Beyond SR, PC-SRGAN augments physically meaningful machine learning, incorporating numerically justified time integrators and advanced quality metrics. These advancements promise reliable and causal machine-learning models in scientific domains. A significant advantage of PC-SRGAN over conventional SR techniques is its physical consistency, which makes it a viable surrogate model for time-dependent problems. PC-SRGAN advances scientific machine learning by improving accuracy and efficiency, enhancing process understanding, and broadening applications to scientific research. We publicly release the complete source code of PC-SRGAN and all experiments at this https URL.

Title: SIL Allocation for Mitigation Safety Functions
Authors: Hamid Jahanian
Abstract: SIL (Safety Integrity Level) allocation plays a pivotal role in evaluating the significance of Safety Functions (SFs) within high-risk industries. The outcomes of a SIL allocation study determine the design specifications necessary to uphold the Probability of Failure on Demand (PFD) below permissible limits, thus managing risk effectively. While extensive research has focused on SIL allocation for preventive SFs, there is a noticeable gap in attention towards mitigation SFs. To address this gap, this paper discusses the shortcomings of current methods and proposes a new approach to overcome them. The principles of the proposed method are substantiated by detailed mathematical formulation and the practical application of the method is demonstrated through a case study in a road tunnel project.

Title: Passive Multi-Target Visible Light Positioning Based on Multi-Camera Joint Optimization
Authors: Wenxuan Pan, Yang Yang, Dong Wei, Meng Zhang, Zhiyu Zhu
Abstract: Camera-based visible light positioning (VLP) has emerged as a promising indoor positioning technique. However, the need for dedicated luminaire infrastructure and on-target cameras in existing algorithms may limit their scalability and increase deployment costs. To address these limitations, this letter proposes a passive VLP algorithm based on Multi-Camera Joint Optimization (MCJO). In the considered system, multiple ceiling-mounted pre-calibrated cameras continuously capture images of targets with unmodulated point light sources, and can simultaneously localize these targets at the server. In particular, MCJO comprises two stages: It first estimates target positions via linear least squares (LLS) from multi-view projection rays; then refines these positions through nonlinear joint optimization to minimize the reprojection error. Simulation results show that MCJO can achieve millimeter-level accuracy, with an improvement of 19% over an LLS-based state-of-the-art algorithm. Experimental results further show that MCJO achieves an average position error as low as 5.63 mm.

Title: FUTransUNet-GradCAM: A Hybrid Transformer-U-Net with Self-Attention and Explainable Visualizations for Foot Ulcer Segmentation
Authors: Akwasi Asare, Mary Sagoe, Justice Williams Asare
Abstract: Automated segmentation of diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) plays a critical role in clinical diagnosis, therapeutic planning, and longitudinal wound monitoring. However, this task remains challenging due to the heterogeneous appearance, irregular morphology, and complex backgrounds associated with ulcer regions in clinical photographs. Traditional convolutional neural networks (CNNs), such as U-Net, provide strong localization capabilities but struggle to model long-range spatial dependencies due to their inherently limited receptive fields. To address this, we propose FUTransUNet, a hybrid architecture that integrates the global attention mechanism of Vision Transformers (ViTs) into the U-Net framework. This combination allows the model to extract global contextual features while maintaining fine-grained spatial resolution through skip connections and an effective decoding pathway. We trained and validated FUTransUNet on the public Foot Ulcer Segmentation Challenge (FUSeg) dataset. FUTransUNet achieved a training Dice Coefficient of 0.8679, an IoU of 0.7672, and a training loss of 0.0053. On the validation set, the model achieved a Dice Coefficient of 0.8751, an IoU of 0.7780, and a validation loss of 0.009045. To ensure clinical transparency, we employed Grad-CAM visualizations, which highlighted model focus areas during prediction. These quantitative outcomes clearly demonstrate that our hybrid approach successfully integrates global and local feature extraction paradigms, thereby offering a highly robust, accurate, explainable, and interpretable solution and clinically translatable solution for automated foot ulcer analysis. The approach offers a reliable, high-fidelity solution for DFU segmentation, with implications for improving real-world wound assessment and patient care.

Title: Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM
Authors: Saif Khan Mohammed, Saurabh Prakash, Muhammad Ubadah, Imran Ali Khan, Ronny Hadani, Shlomo Rakib, Shachar Kons, Yoav Hebron, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Zak-Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (Zak-OTFS) modulation has been shown to achieve significantly better performance compared to the standardized Cyclic-Prefix Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (CP-OFDM), in high delay/Doppler spread scenarios envisaged in next generation communication systems. Zak-OTFS carriers are quasi-periodic pulses in the delay-Doppler (DD) domain, characterized by two parameters, (i) the pulse period along the delay axis (``delay period") (Doppler period is related to the delay period), and (ii) the pulse shaping filter. An important practical challenge is enabling support for Zak-OTFS modulation in existing CP-OFDM based modems. In this paper we show that Zak-OTFS modulation with pulse shaping constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth equal to the communication bandwidth $B$) followed by time-windowing with a rectangular window of duration $(T + T_{cp})$ ($T$ is the symbol duration and $T_{cp}$ is the CP duration), can be implemented as a low-complexity precoder over standard CP-OFDM. We also show that the Zak-OTFS de-modulator with matched filtering constrained to sinc filtering (filter bandwidth $B$) followed by rectangular time windowing over duration $T$ can be implemented as a low-complexity post-processing of the CP-OFDM de-modulator output. This proposed ``Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM" architecture enables us to harness the benefits of Zak-OTFS in existing network infrastructure. We also show that the proposed Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM is a family of modulations, with CP-OFDM being a special case when the delay period takes its minimum possible value equal to the inverse bandwidth, i.e., Zak-OTFS over CP-OFDM with minimum delay period.

Title: TurboBias: Universal ASR Context-Biasing powered by GPU-accelerated Phrase-Boosting Tree
Authors: Andrei Andrusenko, Vladimir Bataev, Lilit Grigoryan, Vitaly Lavrukhin, Boris Ginsburg
Abstract: Recognizing specific key phrases is an essential task for contextualized Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, most existing context-biasing approaches have limitations associated with the necessity of additional model training, significantly slow down the decoding process, or constrain the choice of the ASR system type. This paper proposes a universal ASR context-biasing framework that supports all major types: CTC, Transducers, and Attention Encoder-Decoder models. The framework is based on a GPU-accelerated word boosting tree, which enables it to be used in shallow fusion mode for greedy and beam search decoding without noticeable speed degradation, even with a vast number of key phrases (up to 20K items). The obtained results showed high efficiency of the proposed method, surpassing the considered open-source context-biasing approaches in accuracy and decoding speed. Our context-biasing framework is open-sourced as a part of the NeMo toolkit.

Title: XEmoRAG: Cross-Lingual Emotion Transfer with Controllable Intensity Using Retrieval-Augmented Generation
Authors: Tianlun Zuo, Jingbin Hu, Yuke Li, Xinfa Zhu, Hai Li, Ying Yan, Junhui Liu, Danming Xie, Lei Xie
Abstract: Zero-shot emotion transfer in cross-lingual speech synthesis refers to generating speech in a target language, where the emotion is expressed based on reference speech from a different source language. However, this task remains challenging due to the scarcity of parallel multilingual emotional corpora, the presence of foreign accent artifacts, and the difficulty of separating emotion from language-specific prosodic features. In this paper, we propose XEmoRAG, a novel framework to enable zero-shot emotion transfer from Chinese to Thai using a large language model (LLM)-based model, without relying on parallel emotional data. XEmoRAG extracts language-agnostic emotional embeddings from Chinese speech and retrieves emotionally matched Thai utterances from a curated emotional database, enabling controllable emotion transfer without explicit emotion labels. Additionally, a flow-matching alignment module minimizes pitch and duration mismatches, ensuring natural prosody. It also blends Chinese timbre into the Thai synthesis, enhancing rhythmic accuracy and emotional expression, while preserving speaker characteristics and emotional consistency. Experimental results show that XEmoRAG synthesizes expressive and natural Thai speech using only Chinese reference audio, without requiring explicit emotion labels. These results highlight XEmoRAG's capability to achieve flexible and low-resource emotional transfer across languages. Our demo is available at this https URL .

Title: RIS-Assisted NOMA with Partial CSI and Mutual Coupling: A Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Bile Peng, Karl-Ludwig Besser, Shanpu Shen, Finn Siegismund-Poschmann, Ramprasad Raghunath, Daniel M. Mittleman, Vahid Jamali, Eduard A. Jorswieck
Abstract: Non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is a promising multiple access technique. Its performance depends strongly on the wireless channel property, which can be enhanced by reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs). In this paper, we jointly optimize base station (BS) precoding and RIS configuration with unsupervised machine learning (ML), which looks for the optimal solution autonomously. In particular, we propose a dedicated neural network (NN) architecture RISnet inspired by domain knowledge in communication. Compared to state-of-the-art, the proposed approach combines analytical optimal BS precoding and ML-enabled RIS, has a high scalability to control more than 1000 RIS elements, has a low requirement for channel state information (CSI) in input, and addresses the mutual coupling between RIS elements. Beyond the considered problem, this work is an early contribution to domain knowledge enabled ML, which exploit the domain expertise of communication systems to design better approaches than general ML methods.

Title: Dynamic Transfer Policies for Parallel Queues
Authors: Timothy C. Y. Chan, Jangwon Park, Vahid Sarhangian
Abstract: We consider the problem of load balancing in parallel queues by transferring customers between them at discrete points in time. Holding costs accrue as customers wait in the queue, while transfer decisions incur both fixed (setup) costs and variable costs that increase with the number of transfers and travel distance, and vary by transfer direction. Our work is primarily motivated by inter-facility patient transfers to address imbalanced congestion and inequity in access to care during surges in hospital demand. Analyzing an associated fluid control problem, we show that under general assumptions, including time-varying arrivals and convex holding costs, the optimal policy partitions the state-space into a well-defined $\textit{no-transfer region}$ and its complement, implying that transferring is optimal if and only if the system is sufficiently imbalanced. In the absence of fixed transfer costs, an optimal policy moves the state to the no-transfer region's boundary; in contrast, with fixed costs, the state is moved to its relative interior. Leveraging our structural results, we propose a simulation-based approximate dynamic programming (ADP) algorithm to find effective transfer policies for the stochastic system. We investigate the performance and robustness of the fluid and ADP policies in a case study calibrated using data during the COVID-19 pandemic in the Greater Toronto Area, which demonstrates that transferring patients between hospitals could result in up to 27.7% reduction in total cost with relatively few transfers.

Title: Beamforming Design for Joint Target Sensing and Proactive Eavesdropping
Authors: Qian Dan, Hongjiang Lei, Ki-Hong Park, Gaofeng Pan, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: This work studies the beamforming design in the joint target sensing and proactive eavesdropping (JTSAPE) system. The JTSAPE base station (BS) receives the information transmitted by the illegal transmitter and transmits the waveform for target sensing. The shared waveform also serves as artificial noise to interfere with the illegal receiver, thereby achieving proactive eavesdropping. We firstly optimize the transmitting beam of the BS to maximize the eavesdropping signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio or minimize the target estimation parameter Cram{é}r-Rao bound, respectively. Then, the joint optimization of proactive eavesdropping and target sensing is investigated, and the normalized weighted optimization problem is formulated. To address the complexity of the original problem, the formulated problem is decomposed into two subproblems: proactive eavesdropping and target sensing, which are solved by the semi-definite relaxation technique. Furthermore, the scenario in which the quality of the eavesdropping channel is stronger than that of the illegal channel is considered. We utilize the sequential rank-one constraint relaxation method and iteration technique to obtain the high-quality suboptimal solution of the beam transmit covariance matrix. Numerical simulation shows the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: Vision-Based Adaptive Robotics for Autonomous Surface Crack Repair
Authors: Joshua Genova, Eric Cabrera, Vedhus Hoskere
Abstract: Surface cracks in infrastructure can lead to severe deterioration and expensive maintenance if not efficiently repaired. Manual repair methods are labor-intensive, time-consuming, and imprecise. While advancements in robotic perception and manipulation have progressed autonomous crack repair, three key challenges remain: accurate localization in the robot's coordinate frame, adaptability to varying crack sizes, and realistic validation of repairs. We present an adaptive, autonomous robotic system for surface crack detection and repair using advanced sensing technologies to enhance precision and safety for humans. A laser scanner is used to refine crack coordinates for accurate localization. Furthermore, our adaptive crack filling approach outperforms fixed speed techniques in efficiency and consistency. We validate our method using 3D printed cracks under realistic conditions, demonstrating repeatable testing. This research contributes to the field of human-robot interaction by reducing manual labor, improving safety, and streamlining maintenance operations, ultimately paving the way for more sophisticated and integrated construction robotics.

Title: 3DFacePolicy: Audio-Driven 3D Facial Animation Based on Action Control
Authors: Xuanmeng Sha, Liyun Zhang, Tomohiro Mashita, Naoya Chiba, Yuki Uranishi
Abstract: Audio-driven 3D facial animation has achieved significant progress in both research and applications. While recent baselines struggle to generate natural and continuous facial movements due to their frame-by-frame vertex generation approach, we propose 3DFacePolicy, a pioneer work that introduces a novel definition of vertex trajectory changes across consecutive frames through the concept of "action". By predicting action sequences for each vertex that encode frame-to-frame movements, we reformulate vertex generation approach into an action-based control paradigm. Specifically, we leverage a robotic control mechanism, diffusion policy, to predict action sequences conditioned on both audio and vertex states. Extensive experiments on VOCASET and BIWI datasets demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods and is particularly expert in dynamic, expressive and naturally smooth facial animations.

Title: Risk Estimate under a Time-Varying Autoregressive Model for Data-Driven Reproduction Number Estimation
Authors: Barbara Pascal, Samuel Vaiter
Abstract: COVID-19 pandemic has brought to the fore epidemiological models which, though describing a wealth of behaviors, have previously received little attention in signal processing literature. In this work, a generalized time-varying autoregressive model is considered, encompassing, but not reducing to, a state-of-the-art model of viral epidemics propagation. The time-varying parameter of this model is estimated via the minimization of a penalized likelihood estimator. A major challenge is that the estimation accuracy strongly depends on hyperparameters fine-tuning. Without available ground truth, hyperparameters are selected by minimizing specifically designed data-driven oracles, used as proxy for the estimation error. Focusing on the time-varying autoregressive Poisson model, Stein's Unbiased Risk Estimate formalism is generalized to construct asymptotically unbiased risk estimators based on the derivation of an original autoregressive counterpart of Stein's lemma. The accuracy of these oracles and of the resulting estimates are assessed through intensive Monte Carlo simulations on synthetic data. Then, elaborating on recent epidemiological models, a novel weekly scaled Poisson model is proposed, better accounting for intrinsic variability of the contaminations while being robust to reporting errors. Finally, the data-driven procedure is particularized to the estimation of COVID-19 reproduction number from weekly infection counts demonstrating its ability to tackle real-world applications.

Title: A Survey on All-in-One Image Restoration: Taxonomy, Evaluation and Future Trends
Authors: Junjun Jiang, Zengyuan Zuo, Gang Wu, Kui Jiang, Xianming Liu
Abstract: Image restoration (IR) seeks to recover high-quality images from degraded observations caused by a wide range of factors, including noise, blur, compression, and adverse weather. While traditional IR methods have made notable progress by targeting individual degradation types, their specialization often comes at the cost of generalization, leaving them ill-equipped to handle the multifaceted distortions encountered in real-world applications. In response to this challenge, the all-in-one image restoration (AiOIR) paradigm has recently emerged, offering a unified framework that adeptly addresses multiple degradation types. These innovative models enhance the convenience and versatility by adaptively learning degradation-specific features while simultaneously leveraging shared knowledge across diverse corruptions. In this survey, we provide the first in-depth and systematic overview of AiOIR, delivering a structured taxonomy that categorizes existing methods by architectural designs, learning paradigms, and their core innovations. We systematically categorize current approaches and assess the challenges these models encounter, outlining research directions to propel this rapidly evolving field. To facilitate the evaluation of existing methods, we also consolidate widely-used datasets, evaluation protocols, and implementation practices, and compare and summarize the most advanced open-source models. As the first comprehensive review dedicated to AiOIR, this paper aims to map the conceptual landscape, synthesize prevailing techniques, and ignite further exploration toward more intelligent, unified, and adaptable visual restoration systems.

Abstract: The marmoset, a highly vocal primate, is a key model for studying social-communicative behavior. Unlike human speech, marmoset vocalizations are less structured, highly variable, and recorded in noisy, low-resource conditions. Learning marmoset communication requires joint call segmentation, classification, and caller identification -- challenging domain tasks. Previous CNNs handle local patterns but struggle with long-range temporal structure. We applied Transformers using self-attention for global dependencies. However, Transformers show overfitting and instability on small, noisy annotated datasets. To address this, we pretrain Transformers with MAE -- a self-supervised method reconstructing masked segments from hundreds of hours of unannotated marmoset recordings. The pretraining improved stability and generalization. Results show MAE-pretrained Transformers outperform CNNs, demonstrating modern self-supervised architectures effectively model low-resource non-human vocal communication.

Title: Gotta Hear Them All: Towards Sound Source Aware Audio Generation
Authors: Wei Guo, Heng Wang, Jianbo Ma, Weidong Cai
Abstract: Audio synthesis has broad applications in multimedia. Recent advancements have made it possible to generate relevant audios from inputs describing an audio scene, such as images or texts. However, the immersiveness and expressiveness of the generation are limited. One possible problem is that existing methods solely rely on the global scene and overlook details of local sounding objects (i.e., sound sources). To address this issue, we propose a Sound Source-Aware Audio (SS2A) generator. SS2A is able to locally perceive multimodal sound sources from a scene with visual detection and cross-modality translation. It then contrastively learns a Cross-Modal Sound Source (CMSS) Manifold to semantically disambiguate each source. Finally, we attentively mix their CMSS semantics into a rich audio representation, from which a pretrained audio generator outputs the sound. To model the CMSS manifold, we curate a novel single-sound-source visual-audio dataset VGGS3 from VGGSound. We also design a Sound Source Matching Score to clearly measure localized audio relevance. With the effectiveness of explicit sound source modeling, SS2A achieves state-of-the-art performance in extensive image-to-audio tasks. We also qualitatively demonstrate SS2A's ability to achieve intuitive synthesis control by compositing vision, text, and audio conditions. Furthermore, we show that our sound source modeling can achieve competitive video-to-audio performance with a straightforward temporal aggregation mechanism.

Title: Multi-Keypoint Affordance Representation for Functional Dexterous Grasping
Authors: Fan Yang, Dongsheng Luo, Wenrui Chen, Jiacheng Lin, Junjie Cai, Kailun Yang, Zhiyong Li, Yaonan Wang
Abstract: Functional dexterous grasping requires precise hand-object interaction, going beyond simple gripping. Existing affordance-based methods primarily predict coarse interaction regions and cannot directly constrain the grasping posture, leading to a disconnection between visual perception and manipulation. To address this issue, we propose a multi-keypoint affordance representation for functional dexterous grasping, which directly encodes task-driven grasp configurations by localizing functional contact points. Our method introduces Contact-guided Multi-Keypoint Affordance (CMKA), leveraging human grasping experience images for weak supervision combined with Large Vision Models for fine affordance feature extraction, achieving generalization while avoiding manual keypoint annotations. Additionally, we present a Keypoint-based Grasp matrix Transformation (KGT) method, ensuring spatial consistency between hand keypoints and object contact points, thus providing a direct link between visual perception and dexterous grasping actions. Experiments on public real-world FAH datasets, IsaacGym simulation, and challenging robotic tasks demonstrate that our method significantly improves affordance localization accuracy, grasp consistency, and generalization to unseen tools and tasks, bridging the gap between visual affordance learning and dexterous robotic manipulation.

Title: The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Roy El-Helou, Matthew K.X.J Pan
Abstract: This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.

Title: Enhancing Wide-Angle Image Using Narrow-Angle View of the Same Scene
Authors: Hussain Md. Safwan, Mahbub Islam Mahim
Abstract: A common dilemma while photographing a scene is whether to capture it at a wider angle, allowing more of the scene to be covered but in less detail or to click in a narrow angle that captures better details but leaves out portions of the scene. We propose a novel method in this paper that infuses wider shots with finer quality details that is usually associated with an image captured by the primary lens by capturing the same scene using both narrow and wide field of view (FoV) lenses. We do so by training a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based model to learn to extract the visual quality parameters from a narrow-angle shot and to transfer these to the corresponding wide-angle image of the scene using residual connections and an attention-based fusion module. We have mentioned in details the proposed technique to isolate the visual essence of an image and to transfer it into another image. We have also elaborately discussed our implementation details and have presented the results of evaluation over several benchmark datasets and comparisons with contemporary advancements in the field.

Title: Learning to Harmonize Cross-vendor X-ray Images by Non-linear Image Dynamics Correction
Authors: Yucheng Lu, Shunxin Wang, Dovile Juodelyte, Veronika Cheplygina
Abstract: In this paper, we explore how conventional image enhancement can improve model robustness in medical image analysis. By applying commonly used normalization methods to images from various vendors and studying their influence on model generalization in transfer learning, we show that the nonlinear characteristics of domain-specific image dynamics cannot be addressed by simple linear transforms. To tackle this issue, we reformulate the image harmonization task as an exposure correction problem and propose a method termed Global Deep Curve Estimation (GDCE) to reduce domain-specific exposure mismatch. GDCE performs enhancement via a pre-defined polynomial function and is trained with a "domain discriminator", aiming to improve model transparency in downstream tasks compared to existing black-box methods.

Title: Dopamine Audiobook: A Training-free MLLM Agent for Emotional and Immersive Audiobook Generation
Authors: Yan Rong, Shan Yang, Chenxing Li, Dong Yu, Li Liu
Abstract: Audiobook generation aims to create rich, immersive listening experiences from multimodal inputs, but current approaches face three critical challenges: (1) the lack of synergistic generation of diverse audio types (e.g., speech, sound effects, and music) with precise temporal and semantic alignment; (2) the difficulty in conveying expressive, fine-grained emotions, which often results in machine-like vocal outputs; and (3) the absence of automated evaluation frameworks that align with human preferences for complex and diverse audio. To address these issues, we propose Dopamine Audiobook, a novel unified training-free multi-agent system, where a multimodal large language model (MLLM) serves two specialized roles (i.e., speech designer and audio designer) for emotional, human-like, and immersive audiobook generation and evaluation. Specifically, we firstly propose a flow-based, context-aware framework for diverse audio generation with word-level semantic and temporal alignment. To enhance expressiveness, we then design word-level paralinguistic augmentation, utterance-level prosody retrieval, and adaptive TTS model selection. Finally, for evaluation, we introduce a novel MLLM-based evaluation framework incorporating self-critique, perspective-taking, and psychological MagicEmo prompts to ensure human-aligned and self-aligned assessments. Experimental results demonstrate that our method achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on multiple metrics. Importantly, our evaluation framework shows better alignment with human preferences and transferability across audio tasks.

Authors: Fengping Tian, Chenyang Lyu, Xuanfan Ni, Haoqin Sun, Qingjuan Li, Zhiqiang Qian, Haijun Li, Longyue Wang, Zhao Xu, Weihua Luo, Kaifu Zhang
Abstract: This paper presents a multifunctional speech synthesis system that integrates voice cloning and emotion control speech synthesis within a unified framework. The goal of this work is to address longstanding challenges in achieving highly expressive, controllable, and natural speech generation that faithfully preserves speaker identity across diverse linguistic and emotional contexts. Our approach introduces an effective speaker-emotion disentanglement mechanism with in-batch contrastive learning, enabling independent manipulation of speaker identity and eemotional style, as well as rotational emotional embedding integration method for smooth emotion control. To support comprehensive training and evaluation, we construct CSEMOTIONS, a high-quality emotional speech dataset containing 10 hours of Mandarin speech from six professional speakers across seven emotional categories. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our system, Marco-Voice, achieves substantial improvements in both objective and subjective metrics. Comprehensive evaluations and analysis were conducted, results show that MarcoVoice delivers competitive performance in terms of speech clarity and emotional richness, representing a substantial advance in the field of expressive neural speech synthesis. Our code and dataset are publicly available at this https URL and this https URL respectively.

Title: REINA: Regularized Entropy Information-Based Loss for Efficient Simultaneous Speech Translation
Authors: Nameer Hirschkind, Joseph Liu, Xiao Yu, Mahesh Kumar Nandwana
Abstract: Simultaneous Speech Translation (SimulST) systems stream in audio while simultaneously emitting translated text or speech. Such systems face the significant challenge of balancing translation quality and latency. We introduce a strategy to optimize this tradeoff: wait for more input only if you gain information by doing so. Based on this strategy, we present Regularized Entropy INformation Adaptation (REINA), a novel loss to train an adaptive policy using an existing non-streaming translation model. We derive REINA from information theory principles and show that REINA helps push the reported Pareto frontier of the latency/quality tradeoff over prior works. Utilizing REINA, we train a SimulST model on French, Spanish and German, both from and into English. Training on only open source or synthetically generated data, we achieve state-of-the-art (SOTA) streaming results for models of comparable size. We also introduce a metric for streaming efficiency, quantitatively showing REINA improves the latency/quality trade-off by as much as 21% compared to prior approaches, normalized against non-streaming baseline BLEU scores.

Title: Audio-Thinker: Guiding Audio Language Model When and How to Think via Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Shu Wu, Chenxing Li, Wenfu Wang, Hao Zhang, Hualei Wang, Meng Yu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models, multimodal large language models, and large audio language models (LALMs) have significantly improved their reasoning capabilities through reinforcement learning with rule-based rewards. However, the explicit reasoning process has yet to show significant benefits for audio question answering, and effectively leveraging deep reasoning remains an open challenge, with LALMs still falling short of human-level auditory-language reasoning. To address these limitations, we propose Audio-Thinker, a reinforcement learning framework designed to enhance the reasoning capabilities of LALMs, with a focus on improving adaptability, consistency, and effectiveness. Our approach introduces an adaptive think accuracy reward, enabling the model to adjust its reasoning strategies based on task complexity dynamically. Furthermore, we incorporate an external reward model to evaluate the overall consistency and quality of the reasoning process, complemented by think-based rewards that help the model distinguish between valid and flawed reasoning paths during training. Experimental results demonstrate that our Audio-Thinker model outperforms existing reasoning-oriented LALMs across various benchmark tasks, exhibiting superior reasoning and generalization capabilities.
