Title: DualVision ArthroNav: Investigating Opportunities to Enhance Localization and Reconstruction in Image-based Arthroscopy Navigation via External Cameras
Authors: Hongchao Shu, Lalithkumar Seenivasan, Mingxu Liu, Yunseo Hwang, Yu-Chun Ku, Jonathan Knopf, Alejandro Martin-Gomez, Mehran Armand, Mathias Unberath
Abstract: Arthroscopic procedures can greatly benefit from navigation systems that enhance spatial awareness, depth perception, and field of view. However, existing optical tracking solutions impose strict workspace constraints and disrupt surgical workflow. Vision-based alternatives, though less invasive, often rely solely on the monocular arthroscope camera, making them prone to drift, scale ambiguity, and sensitivity to rapid motion or occlusion. We propose DualVision ArthroNav, a multi-camera arthroscopy navigation system that integrates an external camera rigidly mounted on the arthroscope. The external camera provides stable visual odometry and absolute localization, while the monocular arthroscope video enables dense scene reconstruction. By combining these complementary views, our system resolves the scale ambiguity and long-term drift inherent in monocular SLAM and ensures robust relocalization. Experiments demonstrate that our system effectively compensates for calibration errors, achieving an average absolute trajectory error of 1.09 mm. The reconstructed scenes reach an average target registration error of 2.16 mm, with high visual fidelity (SSIM = 0.69, PSNR = 22.19). These results indicate that our system provides a practical and cost-efficient solution for arthroscopic navigation, bridging the gap between optical tracking and purely vision-based systems, and paving the way toward clinically deployable, fully vision-based arthroscopic guidance.

Title: Privacy protection under the exposure of systems' prior information
Authors: Le Liu, Yu Kawano, Ming Cao
Abstract: For systems whose states implicate sensitive information, their privacy is of great concern. While notions like differential privacy have been successfully introduced to dynamical systems, it is still unclear how a system's privacy can be properly protected when facing the challenging yet frequently-encountered scenario where an adversary possesses prior knowledge, e.g., the steady state, of the system. This paper presents a new systematic approach to protect the privacy of a discrete-time linear time-invariant system against adversaries knowledgeable of the system's prior information. We employ a tailored \emph{pointwise maximal leakage (PML) privacy} criterion. PML characterizes the worst-case privacy performance, which is sharply different from that of the better-known mutual-information privacy. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions for PML privacy and construct tractable design procedures. Furthermore, our analysis leads to insight into how PML privacy, differential privacy, and mutual-information privacy are related. We then revisit Kalman filters from the perspective of PML privacy and derive a lower bound on the steady-state estimation-error covariance in terms of the PML parameters. Finally, the derived results are illustrated in a case study of privacy protection for distributed sensing in smart buildings.

Title: Retail electricity costs and emissions incentives are misaligned for commercial and industrial power consumers
Authors: Fletcher T. Chapin, Akshay K. Rao, Adhithyan Sakthivelu, Carson I. Tucker, Eres David, Casey S. Chen, Erin Musabandesu, Meagan S. Mauter
Abstract: Electrification is contributing to substantial growth in U.S. commercial and industrial loads, but the cost and Scope 2 carbon emission implications of this load growth are opaque for both power consumers and utilities. This work describes a unique spatiotemporally resolved data set of U.S. electricity costs and emissions and applies time series approximation methods to quantify the alignment of electricity cost and emission incentives for large commercial and industrial consumers. We present a comprehensive spatiotemporal dataset of U.S. price-based demand response (i.e., tariff) and incentive-based demand response (IBDR) programs, enabling direct comparison to previously published marginal emission factor (MEF), average emission factor (AEF), and day-ahead market (DAM) prices. We resolved the structural incompatibility and fragmentation of these datasets by developing time series approximations of discrete data and unifying geospatially heterogeneous datasets. Analysis of these datasets reveals significant spatial and temporal heterogeneity in cost and carbon emissions incentives for demand-side energy flexibility, underscoring the importance of site selection as a key factor influencing power costs and scope 2 emissions. Analysis also reveals broad misalignment of economic and emissions incentives under existing electricity tariff structures, meaning tariffs are incentivizing consumption of more carbon-intensive electricity, and highlighting potential barriers to electrification delivering carbon savings.

Title: Towards Attribution of Generators and Emotional Manipulation in Cross-Lingual Synthetic Speech using Geometric Learning
Authors: Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Farhan Sheth, Muskaan Singh
Abstract: In this work, we address the problem of finegrained traceback of emotional and manipulation characteristics from synthetically manipulated speech. We hypothesize that combining semantic-prosodic cues captured by Speech Foundation Models (SFMs) with fine-grained spectral dynamics from auditory representations can enable more precise tracing of both emotion and manipulation source. To validate this hypothesis, we introduce MiCuNet, a novel multitask framework for fine-grained tracing of emotional and manipulation attributes in synthetically generated speech. Our approach integrates SFM embeddings with spectrogram-based auditory features through a mixed-curvature projection mechanism that spans Hyperbolic, Euclidean, and Spherical spaces guided by a learnable temporal gating mechanism. Our proposed method adopts a multitask learning setup to simultaneously predict original emotions, manipulated emotions, and manipulation sources on the EmoFake dataset (EFD) across both English and Chinese subsets. MiCuNet yields consistent improvements, consistently surpassing conventional fusion strategies. To the best of our knowledge, this work presents the first study to explore a curvature-adaptive framework specifically tailored for multitask tracking in synthetic speech.

Title: Curved Worlds, Clear Boundaries: Generalizing Speech Deepfake Detection using Hyperbolic and Spherical Geometry Spaces
Authors: Farhan Sheth, Girish, Mohd Mujtaba Akhtar, Muskaan Singh
Abstract: In this work, we address the challenge of generalizable audio deepfake detection (ADD) across diverse speech synthesis paradigms-including conventional text-to-speech (TTS) systems and modern diffusion or flow-matching (FM) based generators. Prior work has mostly targeted individual synthesis families and often fails to generalize across paradigms due to overfitting to generation-specific artifacts. We hypothesize that synthetic speech, irrespective of its generative origin, leaves behind shared structural distortions in the embedding space that can be aligned through geometry-aware modeling. To this end, we propose RHYME, a unified detection framework that fuses utterance-level embeddings from diverse pretrained speech encoders using non-Euclidean projections. RHYME maps representations into hyperbolic and spherical manifolds-where hyperbolic geometry excels at modeling hierarchical generator families, and spherical projections capture angular, energy-invariant cues such as periodic vocoder artifacts. The fused representation is obtained via Riemannian barycentric averaging, enabling synthesis-invariant alignment. RHYME outperforms individual PTMs and homogeneous fusion baselines, achieving top performance and setting new state-of-the-art in cross-paradigm ADD.

Title: Semantic Property Maps for Driving Applications
Authors: Marcus Greiff, Ray Zhang, Takeru Shirasawa, John Subosits
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating the parameters of a vehicle dynamics model for predictive control in driving applications. Instead of solely using the instantaneous parameters estimated from the vehicle signals, we combine this with cameras and update a probabilistic map with parameter estimates and semantic information using Bayesian moment matching. Key to this approach is the map representation, which is constructed with conjugate priors to the measurement likelihoods and defined in the same path coordinates as the vehicle controller, such that the map can be externalized to provide a local representation of the parameter likelihoods that vary in space. The result is a spatial map of vehicle parameters adapted online to enhance the driving control system. We provide theoretical guarantees on the smoothness of relevant parameter likelihood statistics as a function of space, which is critical for their use in predictive control.

Title: From Attention to Frequency: Integration of Vision Transformer and FFT-ReLU for Enhanced Image Deblurring
Authors: Syed Mumtahin Mahmud, Mahdi Mohd Hossain Noki, Prothito Shovon Majumder, Abdul Mohaimen Al Radi, Md. Haider Ali, Md. Mosaddek Khan
Abstract: Image deblurring is vital in computer vision, aiming to recover sharp images from blurry ones caused by motion or camera shake. While deep learning approaches such as CNNs and Vision Transformers (ViTs) have advanced this field, they often struggle with complex or high-resolution blur and computational demands. We propose a new dual-domain architecture that unifies Vision Transformers with a frequency-domain FFT-ReLU module, explicitly bridging spatial attention modeling and frequency sparsity. In this structure, the ViT backbone captures local and global dependencies, while the FFT-ReLU component enforces frequency-domain sparsity to suppress blur-related artifacts and preserve fine details. Extensive experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that this architecture achieves superior PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality compared to state-of-the-art models. Both quantitative metrics, qualitative comparisons, and human preference evaluations confirm its effectiveness, establishing a practical and generalizable paradigm for real-world image restoration.

Title: Tissue Activation Calculation in Dual-lead Deep Brain Stimulation
Authors: Anna Franziska Frigge, Alexander Medvedev
Abstract: Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS) is a well-established neurosurgical treatment aiming at symptom alleviation in a range of neurological and psychiatric diseases. Computational models of DBS are widely used to investigate the effects of stimulation on neural tissue, to explore stimulation targets and sweetspots, and ultimately, to aid clinicians in the DBS programming by calculating the stimulation parameters. Commonly, DBS is performed bilaterally, i.e. with one lead in each brain hemisphere, where computational models are solved independently for one lead at a time. This paper treats scenarios where multiple DBS leads are implanted in close proximity to one another, resulting in interacting electrical fields and, therefore, potentially overlapping stimulation spreads. In particular, a global dual-lead model is compared to approximations derived from single-lead approaches in a cohort of twelve multiple sclerosis (MS) tremor patients. It is concluded that simple superposition of volumes of tissue activated (VTAs) underestimates activation, while superposition of electric fields or activating functions leads to overestimation. It is concluded that given close proximity of DBS leads, the VTA cannot be computed individually as stimulation fields exhibit significant and complex interaction. The approach is extended to modeling two obsessive compulsive disorder patients with medially placed leads, where similar VTA discrepancies as in the MS patient cohort are observed.

Title: Adaptive Digital Twin of Sheet Metal Forming via Proper Orthogonal Decomposition-Based Koopman Operator with Model Predictive Control
Authors: Yi-Ping Chen, Derick Suarez, Ying-Kuan Tsai, Vispi Karkaria, Guanzhong Hu, Zihan Chen, Ping Guo, Jian Cao, Wei Chen
Abstract: Digital Twin (DT) technologies are transforming manufacturing by enabling real-time prediction, monitoring, and control of complex processes. Yet, applying DT to deformation-based metal forming remains challenging because of the strongly coupled spatial-temporal behavior and the nonlinear relationship between toolpath and material response. For instance, sheet-metal forming by the English wheel, a highly flexible but artisan-dependent process, still lacks digital counterparts that can autonomously plan and adapt forming strategies. This study presents an adaptive DT framework that integrates Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) for physics-aware dimensionality reduction with a Koopman operator for representing nonlinear system in a linear lifted space for the real-time decision-making via model predictive control (MPC). To accommodate evolving process conditions or material states, an online Recursive Least Squares (RLS) algorithm is introduced to update the operator coefficients in real time, enabling continuous adaptation of the DT model as new deformation data become available. The proposed framework is experimentally demonstrated on a robotic English Wheel sheet metal forming system, where deformation fields are measured and modeled under varying toolpaths. Results show that the adaptive DT is capable of controlling the forming process to achieve the given target shape by effectively capturing non-stationary process behaviors. Beyond this case study, the proposed framework establishes a generalizable approach for interpretable, adaptive, and computationally-efficient DT of nonlinear manufacturing systems, bridging reduced-order physics representations with data-driven adaptability to support autonomous process control and optimization.

Title: CLIPPan: Adapting CLIP as A Supervisor for Unsupervised Pansharpening
Authors: Lihua Jian, Jiabo Liu, Shaowu Wu, Lihui Chen
Abstract: Despite remarkable advancements in supervised pansharpening neural networks, these methods face domain adaptation challenges of resolution due to the intrinsic disparity between simulated reduced-resolution training data and real-world full-resolution this http URL bridge this gap, we propose an unsupervised pansharpening framework, CLIPPan, that enables model training at full resolution directly by taking CLIP, a visual-language model, as a supervisor. However, directly applying CLIP to supervise pansharpening remains challenging due to its inherent bias toward natural images and limited understanding of pansharpening tasks. Therefore, we first introduce a lightweight fine-tuning pipeline that adapts CLIP to recognize low-resolution multispectral, panchromatic, and high-resolution multispectral images, as well as to understand the pansharpening process. Then, building on the adapted CLIP, we formulate a novel \textit{loss integrating semantic language constraints}, which aligns image-level fusion transitions with protocol-aligned textual prompts (e.g., Wald's or Khan's descriptions), thus enabling CLIPPan to use language as a powerful supervisory signal and guide fusion learning without ground truth. Extensive experiments demonstrate that CLIPPan consistently improves spectral and spatial fidelity across various pansharpening backbones on real-world datasets, setting a new state of the art for unsupervised full-resolution pansharpening.

Title: Detection in Bistatic ISAC with Deterministic Sensing and Gaussian Information Signals
Authors: Xianxin Song, Xianghao Yu, Jie Xu, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) is a disruptive technology enabling future sixth-generation (6G) networks. This paper investigates target detection in a bistatic ISAC system, in which the base station (BS) transmits superimposed ISAC signals comprising both Gaussian information-bearing and deterministic sensing components to simultaneously provide communication and sensing functionalities. First, we develop a Neyman-Pearson (NP)-based detector that effectively utilizes both the deterministic sensing and random communication signals. Closed-form analysis reveals that both signal components contribute to improving the overall detection performance. Subsequently, we optimize the BS transmit beamforming to maximize the detection probability, subject to a minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint for the communication user (CU) and a total transmit power budget at the BS. The resulting non-convex beamforming optimization problem is addressed via semi-definite relaxation (SDR) and successive convex approximation (SCA) techniques. Simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed NP-based detector, which leverages both types of signals, over benchmark schemes that treat information signals as interference. They also reveal that a higher communication-rate threshold directs more transmit power to Gaussian information-bearing signals, thereby diminishing deterministic-signal power and weakening detection performance.

Title: Sensitivity of Finite Element Models to Relationship Between T2 Relaxation and Modulus in Articular Cartilage
Authors: Alexander A. Donabedian, Deva D. Chan
Abstract: Correlating articular cartilage material properties to quantitative magnetic resonance imaging biomarkers is a powerful approach to biofidelic finite element models. However, subject-specific relationships between imaging biomarkers such as T2 and material properties like dynamic modulus are uncertain. To evaluate the sensitivity of finite element models to this uncertainty, we shifted the slope and intercept of a linear T2-dynamic modulus relationship used to define cartilage properties. Modulus shifts led to notable percent changes in the top 1% of calculated stress and strain while modulating slope had a negligible impact, together supporting the use of physiologically relevant moduli ranges in subject-specific models.

Title: Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing and Communications: A Survey
Authors: Qingqing Wu, Qiaoyan Peng, Ziheng Zhang, Xiaodan Shao, Yang Liu, Yifan Jiang, Yapeng Zhao, Yanze Zhu, Yilong Chen, Zixiang Ren, Jie Xu, Wen Chen, Rui Zhang
Abstract: The rapid development of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks requires seamless integration of communication and sensing to support ubiquitous intelligence and real-time, high-reliability applications. Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has emerged as a key solution for achieving this convergence, offering joint utilization of spectral, hardware, and computing resources. However, realizing high-performance ISAC remains challenging due to environmental line-of-sight (LoS) blockage, limited spatial resolution, and the inherent coverage asymmetry and resource coupling between sensing and communication. Intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs), featuring low-cost, energy-efficient, and programmable electromagnetic reconfiguration, provide a promising solution to overcome these limitations. This article presents a comprehensive overview of IRS-aided wireless sensing and ISAC technologies, including IRS architectures, target detection and estimation techniques, beamforming designs, and performance metrics. It further explores IRS-enabled new opportunities for more efficient performance balancing, coexistence, and networking in ISAC systems, focuses on current design bottlenecks, and outlines future research directions. This article aims to offer a unified design framework that guides the development of practical and scalable IRS-aided ISAC systems for the next-generation wireless network.

Title: Region of Attraction Estimate Learning and Verification for Nonlinear Systems using Neural-Network-based Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Adel Bechihi, Aristotelis Kapnopoulos
Abstract: Estimating the Region of Attraction (RoA) for nonlinear dynamical systems is a fundamental problem in control theory, with direct implications for stability analysis and safe controller design. Traditional approaches rely on analytically derived Lyapunov functions, which are often conservative and challenging to construct for high-dimensional or highly nonlinear systems. In this work, we propose a data-driven framework for learning and verifying RoA estimates for nonlinear systems using neural-network-based Lyapunov functions. Our method employs a composite Lyapunov function that combines a quadratic term with a neural-network-based component, providing both structure and flexibility. We introduce a novel homogeneous loss function for training, which removes the imbalance typically caused by the two non-homogeneous Lyapunov conditions. Together, these two aspects enable efficient training of the Lyapunov candidate. To guarantee the correctness of the learned Lyapunov function, we employ a Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) solver to formally verify the stability results. Lastly, we perform a deeper analysis near the origin to overcome numerical artifacts, ensuring strict asymptotic stability. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on benchmark nonlinear systems, showing that it significantly reduces conservatism compared to traditional Lyapunov methods while maintaining verifiability. This framework bridges the gap between function approximation and stability certification, paving the way for scalable safety analysis in learning-based control and safety-critical applications.

Title: Boosting Neural Video Representation via Online Structural Reparameterization
Authors: Ziyi Li, Qingyu Mao, Shuai Liu, Qilei Li, Fanyang Meng, Yongsheng Liang
Abstract: Neural Video Representation~(NVR) is a promising paradigm for video compression, showing great potential in improving video storage and transmission efficiency. While recent advances have made efforts in architectural refinements to improve representational capability, these methods typically involve complex designs, which may incur increased computational overhead and lack the flexibility to integrate into other frameworks. Moreover, the inherent limitation in model capacity restricts the expressiveness of NVR networks, resulting in a performance bottleneck. To overcome these limitations, we propose Online-RepNeRV, a NVR framework based on online structural reparameterization. Specifically, we propose a universal reparameterization block named ERB, which incorporates multiple parallel convolutional paths to enhance the model capacity. To mitigate the overhead, an online reparameterization strategy is adopted to dynamically fuse the parameters during training, and the multi-branch structure is equivalently converted into a single-branch structure after training. As a result, the additional computational and parameter complexity is confined to the encoding stage, without affecting the decoding efficiency. Extensive experiments on mainstream video datasets demonstrate that our method achieves an average PSNR gain of 0.37-2.7 dB over baseline methods, while maintaining comparable training time and decoding speed.

Title: Convergence of Flow-Policy Gradient Learning for Linear Quadratic Regulator Problems
Authors: Farnaz Adib Yaghmaie, Arunava Naha
Abstract: Flow $Q$-learning has recently been introduced to integrate learning from expert demonstrations into an actor-critic structure. Central to this innovation is the ``the one-step policy'' network, which is optimized through a $Q$-function that is regularized with the behavioral cloning from expert trajectories, allowing learning more expressive policies using flow-based generative models. In this paper, we studied the convergence property and stabilizablity of the one-step policy during learning for linear quadratic problems under the offline settings. Our theoretical results are based on a new formulation of the one-step policy loss based on the average expected cost, and regularized with the behavioral cloning loss. Such a formulation allows us to tap into existing strong theoretical results from the policy gradient theorem to study the convergence properties of the one-step policy. We verify our theoretical finding with simulation results on a linearized inverted pendulum.

Title: Prognostics and Health Management in Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells: Current Trends, Challenges, and Future Directions
Authors: Farideh Abdollahi, Kourosh Malek, Thomas Kadyk, Nadiia Kulyk, Christophe Gerling, Michael H. Eikerling
Abstract: Prognostics and Health Management is crucial for the reliability and lifetime assessment of Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs). Here, we review the current advances on this topic, focusing mainly on key degradation mechanisms and methodologies such as physics-aware, data-driven, and hybrid modeling approaches. Key open challenges are analyzed, including the need for more accurate degradation modeling, effective management of multi-stack systems, and advancements in the currently underdeveloped action phase, in which diagnostic and prognostic insights are translated into real-time system responses, such as dynamic load derating, thermal-management adjustments, or automated maintenance triggers, to prevent failures and extend PEFC life. While notable strides have been made in recent years in diagnostics and remaining useful life estimation, it remains challenging to seamlessly integrate these insights into actionable strategies. Future directions highlight the need to address data scarcity and advance interdisciplinary research. Key focus areas include sensor integration, artificial intelligence, and digital twins. Additionally material innovations play a crucial role in bridging existing gaps. This work, therefore, intends to map the further development of Prognostics and Health Management systems toward ensuring the viability of PEFCs in practical applications.

Title: Numerical Discretization Schemes that Preserve Flatness
Authors: Ashutosh Jindal, Florentina Nicolau, David Martin Diego, Ravi Banavar
Abstract: Differential flatness serves as a powerful tool for controlling continuous time nonlinear systems in problems such as motion planning and trajectory tracking. A similar notion, called difference flatness, exists for discrete-time systems. Although many control systems evolve in continuous time, control implementation is performed digitally, requiring discretization. It is well known in the literature that discretization does not necessarily preserve structural properties, and it has been established that, in general, flatness is not preserved under discretization (whether exact or approximate). In this paper, inspired by our previous work [1] and based on the notion of discretization maps, we construct numerical schemes that preserve flatness.

Title: Blockage-aware Hierarchical Codebook Design for RIS-Assisted Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Yan Zhang, Indrakshi Dey, Nicola Marchetti
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel blockage-aware hierarchical beamforming framework for movable antenna (MA) systems operating at millimeter-wave (mm-Wave) frequencies. While existing works on MA systems have demonstrated performance gains over conventional systems, they often neglect the design of specialized codebooks to leverage MA's unique capabilities and address the challenges of increased energy consumption and latency inherent to MA systems. To address these aspects, we first integrate blockage detection into the codebook design process based on the Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm, significantly reducing inefficiencies due to beam evaluations done in blocked directions. Then, we use a two-stage approach to reduce the complexity of the joint beamforming and Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) optimization problem. The simulations demonstrate that the proposed adaptive codebook successfully improves the Energy Efficiency (EE) and reduces the beam training overhead, substantially boosting the practical deployment potential of RIS-assisted MA systems in future wireless networks.

Title: LOKI: a 0.266 pJ/SOP Digital SNN Accelerator with Multi-Cycle Clock-Gated SRAM in 22nm
Authors: Rick Luiken, Lorenzo Pes, Manil Dev Gomony, Sander Stuijk
Abstract: Bio-inspired sensors like Dynamic Vision Sensors (DVS) and silicon cochleas are often combined with Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs), enabling efficient, event-driven processing similar to biological sensory systems. To realize the low-power constraints of the edge, the SNN should run on a hardware architecture that can exploit the sparse nature of the spikes. In this paper, we introduce LOKI, a digital architecture for Fully-Connected (FC) SNNs. By using Multi-Cycle Clock-Gated (MCCG) SRAMs, LOKI can operate at 0.59 V, while running at a clock frequency of 667 MHz. At full throughput, LOKI only consumes 0.266 pJ/SOP. We evaluate LOKI on both the Neuromorphic MNIST (N-MNIST) and the Keyword Spotting k(KWS) tasks, achieving 98.0 % accuracy at 119.8 nJ/inference and 93.0 % accuracy at 546.5 nJ/inference respectively.

Title: 3D-HQAM Constellation Design and Performance Evaluation under AWGN
Authors: Sukhsagar, Nagendra Kumar, Ambuj Kumar Mishra, Vimal Bhatia, Ondrej Krejcar
Abstract: This paper proposes a simple and effective method for constructing higher-order three-dimensional (3D) signal constellations, aiming to enhance the reliability of digital communication systems. The approach systematically extends the conventional two-dimensional hexagonal quadrature amplitude modulation (2D-HQAM) constellation into a 3D-HQAM signal space, forming structured lattice configurations. To address the increased decision complexity resulting from a larger number of constellation points, a dimension reduction (DR) technique is introduced, allowing the derivation of closed-form symbol error probability (SEP) expressions under additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) conditions. Theoretical SEPs closely match simulation results, validating the accuracy of the proposed method. The minimum Euclidean distance (MED) of the 3D constellations shows a minimum increase of 12.14% over 2D constellation for 8-HQAM, reaching up to 160.81% for 1024-HQAM constellations. This significant improvement in MED leads to enhanced error performance. Therefore, the proposed 3D constellations are promising candidates for high-quality and reliable next-generation digital communication systems.

Title: Testbed Evaluation of AI-based Precoding in Distributed MIMO Systems
Authors: Tianzheng Miao, Thomas Feys, Gilles Callebaut, Jarne Van Mulders, Md Arifur Rahman, François Rottenberg
Abstract: Distributed MIMO (D-MIMO) has emerged as a key architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling cooperative transmission across spatially distributed access points (APs). However, most existing studies rely on idealized channel models and lack hardware validation, leaving a gap between algorithmic design and practical deployment. Meanwhile, recent advances in artificial intelligence (AI)-driven precoding have shown strong potential for learning nonlinear channel-to-precoder mappings, but their real-world deployment remains limited due to challenges in data collection and model generalization. This work presents a framework for implementing and validating an AI-based precoder on a D-MIMO testbed with hardware reciprocity calibration. A pre-trained graph neural network (GNN)-based model is fine-tuned using real-world channel state information (CSI) collected from the Techtile platform and evaluated under both interpolation and extrapolation scenarios before end-to-end validation. Experimental results demonstrate a 15.7% performance gain over the pre-trained model in the multi-user case after fine-tuning, while in the single-user scenario the model achieves near-maximum ratio transmission (MRT) performance with less than 0.7 bits/channel use degradation out of a total throughput of 5.19 bits/channel use on unseen positions. Further analysis confirms the data efficiency of real-world measurements, showing consistent gains with increasing training samples, and end-to-end validation verifies coherent power focusing comparable to MRT.

Abstract: Natural language data, such as text and speech, have become readily available through social networking services and chat platforms. By leveraging human observations expressed in natural language, this paper addresses the problem of state estimation for physical systems, in which humans act as sensing agents. To this end, we propose a Language-Aided Particle Filter (LAPF), a particle filter framework that structures human observations via natural language processing and incorporates them into the update step of the state estimation. Finally, the LAPF is applied to the water level estimation problem in an irrigation canal and its effectiveness is demonstrated.

Title: Modeling and Physics-Enhanced Fault Detection in Wastewater Pump Stations
Authors: Katayoun Eshkofti, Henrik Sandberg, Mikael Nilsson, Matthieu Barreau
Abstract: Monitoring wastewater pump stations is essential because they are critical infrastructure. However, monitoring is still often performed manually due to the lack of suitable algorithmic methods and data. This paper introduces a high-fidelity, physics-enhanced simulator of a three-pump wastewater station that captures transient hydro-mechanical dynamics at a one-second resolution. The simulator is fully parameter-driven, adaptable to other wastewater stations, and capable of generating datasets for data-driven analytics. It can also generate balanced faulty datasets when real failures are scarce or confidential. A comparison with high-frequency SCADA data from a municipal station shows strong agreement across key operational metrics. Furthermore, the paper proposes robust statistical and mathematical frameworks for fault detection and isolation, including a nested-model F-test to detect pump degradation or system faults, and a tangent residual approach to distinguish pump faults from system faults using operating-point kinematics. This framework enables what-if studies, facilitates early fault diagnosis based on flow rate and head, and provides actionable insights for condition-based maintenance in wastewater pumping infrastructure.

Title: Policy Optimization for Unknown Systems using Differentiable Model Predictive Control
Authors: Riccardo Zuliani, Efe C. Balta, John Lygeros
Abstract: Model-based policy optimization often struggles with inaccurate system dynamics models, leading to suboptimal closed-loop performance. This challenge is especially evident in Model Predictive Control (MPC) policies, which rely on the model for real-time trajectory planning and optimization. We introduce a novel policy optimization framework for MPC-based policies combining differentiable optimization with zeroth-order optimization. Our method combines model-based and model-free gradient estimation approaches, achieving faster transient performance compared to fully data-driven approaches while maintaining convergence guarantees, even under model uncertainty. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach on a nonlinear control task involving a 12-dimensional quadcopter model.

Title: Large-scale modality-invariant foundation models for brain MRI analysis: Application to lesion segmentation
Authors: Petros Koutsouvelis, Matej Gazda, Leroy Volmer, Sina Amirrajab, Kamil Barbierik, Branislav Setlak, Jakub Gazda, Peter Drotar
Abstract: The field of computer vision is undergoing a paradigm shift toward large-scale foundation model pre-training via self-supervised learning (SSL). Leveraging large volumes of unlabeled brain MRI data, such models can learn anatomical priors that improve few-shot performance in diverse neuroimaging tasks. However, most SSL frameworks are tailored to natural images, and their adaptation to capture multi-modal MRI information remains underexplored. This work proposes a modality-invariant representation learning setup and evaluates its effectiveness in stroke and epilepsy lesion segmentation, following large-scale pre-training. Experimental results suggest that despite successful cross-modality alignment, lesion segmentation primarily benefits from preserving fine-grained modality-specific features. Model checkpoints and code are made publicly available.

Title: A Novel Partitioning Scheme for RIS Identification and Beamforming
Authors: Yarkın Gevez, Aymen Khaleel, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: This letter introduces a novel partitioning scheme for reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) that simultaneously consider RIS identification and beamforming. The proposed scheme dynamicly and efficiently allocates RIS elements between identification and beamforming users, considering the different performance metrics associated with each of them. By employing a dynamic partitioning algorithm that efficiently manage the RIS resources (elements), the scheme significantly enhances the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) while maintaining reliable identification performance. Finally, theoretical analysis and computer simulations are provided to demonstrate the validity of the proposed scheme.

Title: A Geometry Map-Based Propagation Model for Urban Channels
Authors: Junzhe Song, Ruisi He, Mi Yang, Zhengyu Zhang, Shuaiqi Gao, Bo Ai
Abstract: With the rapid deployment of 5G and future 6G networks, accurate modeling of urban radio propagation has become critical for system design and network planning. However, conventional statistical or empirical models fail to fully capture the influence of detailed geometric features in dense urban environments. In this paper, we propose a geometry map-based propagation model that directly extracts key parameters from a 3D geometry map and incorporates the Uniform Theory of Diffraction (UTD) to recursively compute multiple diffraction fields, thereby enabling accurate prediction of large-scale path loss and time-varying Doppler characteristics in urban channels. A significant buildings identification algorithm is developed to efficiently detect buildings that significantly affect signal propagation. The proposed model is validated using urban measurement data, showing excellent agreement with path loss in both LOS and NLOS conditions. In particular, for NLOS scenarios with complex diffraction mechanisms, it outperforms the 3GPP and simplified models, reducing the RMSE by 7.1 dB and 3.18 dB, respectively. Doppler analysis further demonstrates its accuracy in capturing time-varying propagation characteristics, confirming the scalability and generalization capability of the model in urban environments.

Authors: Owen A. Maute, Blake A. Roberts, Berker Peköz
Abstract: This paper presents RadAround, a passive 2-D direction-finding system designed for adversarial IoT sensing in contested environments. Using mechanically steered narrow-beam antennas and field-deployable SCADA software, it generates high-resolution electromagnetic (EM) heatmaps using low-cost COTS or 3D-printed components. The microcontroller-deployable SCADA coordinates antenna positioning and SDR sampling in real time for resilient, on-site operation. Its modular design enables rapid adaptation for applications such as EMC testing in disaster-response deployments, battlefield spectrum monitoring, electronic intrusion detection, and tactical EM situational awareness (EMSA). Experiments show RadAround detecting computing machinery through walls, assessing utilization, and pinpointing EM interference (EMI) leakage sources from Faraday enclosures.

Title: Physiological Measures of the Mental Workload in Users of a Lower Limb Exosuit: A Comparison of Subjective and Objective Metrics
Authors: Giulia Mariani, Chiara Lambranzi, Nicholas Cartocci, Giacinto Barresi, Christian Di Natali, Elena De Momi, Jesus Ortiz
Abstract: Lower-limb exosuits are particularly relevant for individuals with some degree of mobility impairment, such as post-stroke patients or older adults with reduced movement capabilities. This study aims to investigate the mental workload (MWL) assessment of XoSoft, a lower-limb soft exoskeleton, using and comparing subjective and objective physiological metrics. The NASA-TLX questionnaire, the average percentage change in pupil size (APCPS), and the Baevsky stress index (SI) are compared. The experiments were conducted on 18 healthy subjects while walking and involved mathematical tasks to create a double-task condition. The results show a complex interaction between task difficulty, exoskeleton activation, and pupillary dynamics, suggesting that the subject might reach a saturated condition under a high mental load. Besides, the data indicate that pupil diameter may be an objective mental workload indicator that correlates with subjective NASA-TLX questionnaires. The discordant indications from the stress index suggest how different metrics of the ocular and cardiac levels respond differently to various stimuli and dynamics. Research has also revealed ocular asymmetry, with the right eye more sensitive to cognitive load.

Title: Data-Driven Stabilization of Continuous-Time LTI Systems from Noisy Input-Output Data
Authors: Alessandro Bosso, Marco Borghesi, Andrea Iannelli, Bowen Yi, Giuseppe Notarstefano
Abstract: We present an approach to compute stabilizing controllers for continuous-time linear time-invariant systems directly from an input-output trajectory affected by process and measurement noise. The proposed output-feedback design combines (i) an observer of a non-minimal realization of the plant and (ii) a feedback law obtained from a linear matrix inequality (LMI) that depends solely on the available data. Under a suitable interval excitation condition and knowledge of a noise energy bound, the feasibility of the LMI is shown to be necessary and sufficient for stabilizing all non-minimal realizations consistent with the data. We further provide a condition for the feasibility of the LMI related to the signal-to-noise ratio, guidelines to compute the noise energy bound, and numerical simulations that illustrate the effectiveness of the approach.

Title: Heterogeneous CACC Coexistence: Simulation, Analysis, and Modeling
Authors: Lorenzo Ghiro, Marco Franceschini, Renato Lo Cigno, Michele Segata
Abstract: The design of Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control (CACC) algorithms for vehicle platooning has been extensively investigated, leading to a wide range of approaches with different requirements and performance. Most existing studies evaluate these algorithms under the assumption of homogeneous platoons, i.e., when all platoon members adopt the same CACC. However, market competition is likely to result in vehicles from different manufacturers implementing distinct CACCs. This raises fundamental questions about whether heterogeneous vehicles can safely cooperate within a platoon and what performance can be achieved. To date, these questions have received little attention, as heterogeneous platoons are difficult to model and analyze. In this work, we introduce the concept of mixed platoons, i.e., platoons made of vehicles running heterogeneous CACCs, and we study their performance through simulation-based experiments. We consider mixtures of three well-established CACCs from the literature. In the first part of the paper, we study a single mixed platoon in isolation to understand the microscopic effects on safety: we evaluate the performance of various CACC-mixtures across speed change and emergency braking scenarios. In the second part, we examine a high-density ring-road scenario to assess macroscopic impacts on safety, comfort, and traffic throughput, especially comparing throughput results with those obtained from vehicles controlled by a standard Adaptive Cruise Control (ACC) or by human drivers. Our findings highlight that some combinations of CACCs can operate robustly and safely, while others exhibit critical limitations in safety, comfort, or efficiency. These results emphasize the need for careful system design and the development of theoretical frameworks for modeling heterogeneous platoons.

Title: Unsupervised Motion-Compensated Decomposition for Cardiac MRI Reconstruction via Neural Representation
Authors: Xuanyu Tian, Lixuan Chen, Qing Wu, Xiao Wang, Jie Feng, Yuyao Zhang, Hongjiang Wei
Abstract: Cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) imaging is widely used to characterize cardiac morphology and function. To accelerate CMR imaging, various methods have been proposed to recover high-quality spatiotemporal CMR images from highly undersampled k-t space data. However, current CMR reconstruction techniques either fail to achieve satisfactory image quality or are restricted by the scarcity of ground truth data, leading to limited applicability in clinical scenarios. In this work, we proposed MoCo-INR, a new unsupervised method that integrates implicit neural representations (INR) with the conventional motion-compensated (MoCo) framework. Using explicit motion modeling and the continuous prior of INRs, MoCo-INR can produce accurate cardiac motion decomposition and high-quality CMR reconstruction. Furthermore, we introduce a new INR network architecture tailored to the CMR problem, which significantly stabilizes model optimization. Experiments on retrospective (simulated) datasets demonstrate the superiority of MoCo-INR over state-of-the-art methods, achieving fast convergence and fine-detailed reconstructions at ultra-high acceleration factors (e.g., 20x in VISTA sampling). Additionally, evaluations on prospective (real-acquired) free-breathing CMR scans highlight the clinical practicality of MoCo-INR for real-time imaging. Several ablation studies further confirm the effectiveness of the critical components of MoCo-INR.

Title: A Scalable and Exact Relaxation for Densest $k$-Subgraph via Error Bounds
Authors: Ya Liu, Junbin Liu, Wing-Kin Ma, Aritra Konar
Abstract: Given an undirected graph and a size parameter $k$, the Densest $k$-Subgraph (D$k$S) problem extracts the subgraph on $k$ vertices with the largest number of induced edges. While D$k$S is NP--hard and difficult to approximate, penalty-based continuous relaxations of the problem have recently enjoyed practical success for real-world instances of D$k$S. In this work, we propose a scalable and exact continuous penalization approach for D$k$S using the error bound principle, which enables the design of suitable penalty functions. Notably, we develop new theoretical guarantees ensuring that both the global and local optima of the penalized problem match those of the original problem. The proposed penalized reformulation enables the use of first-order continuous optimization methods. In particular, we develop a non-convex proximal gradient algorithm, where the non-convex proximal operator can be computed in closed form, resulting in low per-iteration complexity. We also provide convergence analysis of the algorithm. Experiments on large-scale instances of the D$k$S problem and one of its variants, the Densest ($k_1, k_2$) Bipartite Subgraph (D$k_1k_2$BS) problem, demonstrate that our method achieves a favorable balance between computation cost and solution quality.

Title: Translation-Symmetric Market: Enabling Incentive Compatibility For DER Aggregation
Authors: Ruike Lyu, Chuyi Li, Kedi Zheng, Mengshu Shi, Hongye Guo, Chongqing Kang
Abstract: Virtual power plants (VPPs) are indispensable for coordinating the rapidly growing portfolios of distributed energy resources (DERs) and enabling them to deliver multiple services into higher-level electricity markets. However, the profit allocation procedures that govern VPP participants become increasingly challenging to keep incentive-compatible due to the enlarged DER market power within each VPP, compared to directly bidding into the wholesale market. In this paper, we formulate both the VPP's market participation and its internal operation and profit allocation as consistent market-clearing processes. Building on this unified view, we propose the concept of a translation-symmetric market (TSM) framework, in which market-clearing models maintain identical structural forms across all hierarchical levels. We prove that translation symmetry induces an inductive property: once incentive compatibility holds at one level, it propagates downward to the internal settlements between the VPP and its constituent DERs. TSM also preserves service prices across levels, ensuring competitive conditions and enabling transparent valuation of resource contributions. Theoretical analysis and case studies illustrate how TSM secures incentive-compatible profit allocation in aggregating DERs to provide multiple services.

Title: Enabling Wireless Power Transfer (WPT) in Pinching Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Deqiao Gan, Xiaoxia Xu, Xiaohu Ge, Yue Liu, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: A novel pinching antenna system (PASS) enabled wireless power transfer (WPT) framework is proposed, where energy harvesting receivers (EHRs) and information decoding receivers (IDRs) coexist. By activating pinching antennas (PAs) near both receivers and flexibly adjusting PAs' power radiation ratios, both energy harvesting efficiency and communication quality can be enhanced. A bi-level optimization problem is formulated to overcome the strong coupling between optimization variables. The upper level jointly optimizes transmit beamforming, PA positions, and feasible interval of power radiation ratios for power conversion efficiency (PCE) maximization under rate requirements, while the lower level refines power radiation ratio for the sum rate maximization. Efficient solutions are developed for both two-user and multi-user scenarios. 1) For the two-user case, where an EHR and an IDR coexist, the alternating optimization (AO)-based and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE)-based algorithms are developed to achieve the stationary solutions of transmit beamforming, PA positions, and power radiation ratios. 2) For the multi-user case, a quadratic transform-Lagrangian dual transform (QT-LDT) algorithm is proposed to iteratively update PCE and sum rate by optimizing PA positions and power radiation ratios individually. Closed-form solutions are derived for both maximization problems. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PASS-WPT framework significantly outperforms conventional MIMO and the baseline PASS with fixed power radiation, which demonstrates that: i) Compared to the conventional MIMO and baseline PASS, the proposed PASS-WPT framework achieves 81.45% and 43.19% improvements in PCE of EHRs, and ii) also increases the sum rate by 77.81% and 31.91% for IDRs.

Title: SynthSoM-Twin: A Multi-Modal Sensing-Communication Digital-Twin Dataset for Sim2Real Transfer via Synesthesia of Machines
Authors: Junlong Chen, Ziwei Huang, Xuesong Cai, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: This paper constructs a novel multi-modal sensing-communication digital-twin dataset, named SynthSoM-Twin, which is spatio-temporally consistent with the real world, for Sim2Real transfer via Synesthesia of Machines (SoM). To construct the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we propose a new framework that can extend the quantity and missing modality of existing real-world multi-modal sensing-communication dataset. Specifically, we exploit multi-modal sensing-assisted object detection and tracking algorithms to ensure spatio-temporal consistency of static objects and dynamic objects across real world and simulation environments. The constructed scenario is imported into three high-fidelity simulators, i.e., AirSim, WaveFarer, and Sionna RT. The SynthSoM-Twin dataset contains spatio-temporally consistent data with the real world, including 66,868 snapshots of synthetic RGB images, depth maps, light detection and ranging (LiDAR) point clouds, millimeter wave (mmWave) radar point clouds, and large-scale and small-scale channel fading data. To validate the utility of SynthSoM-Twin dataset, we conduct Sim2Real transfer investigation by implementing two cross-modal downstream tasks via cross-modal generative models (CMGMs), i.e., cross-modal channel generation model and multi-modal sensing-assisted beam generation model. Based on the downstream tasks, we explore the threshold of real-world data injection that can achieve a decent trade-off between real-world data usage and models' practical performance. Experimental results show that the model training on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset achieves a decent practical performance, and the injection of real-world data further facilitates Sim2Real transferability. Based on the SynthSoM-Twin dataset, injecting less than 15% of real-world data can achieve similar and even better performance compared to that trained with all the real-world data only.

Title: Who Moved My Distribution? Conformal Prediction for Interactive Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Allen Emmanuel Binny, Anushri Dixit
Abstract: Uncertainty-aware prediction is essential for safe motion planning, especially when using learned models to forecast the behavior of surrounding agents. Conformal prediction is a statistical tool often used to produce uncertainty-aware prediction regions for machine learning models. Most existing frameworks utilizing conformal prediction-based uncertainty predictions assume that the surrounding agents are non-interactive. This is because in closed-loop, as uncertainty-aware agents change their behavior to account for prediction uncertainty, the surrounding agents respond to this change, leading to a distribution shift which we call endogenous distribution shift. To address this challenge, we introduce an iterative conformal prediction framework that systematically adapts the uncertainty-aware ego-agent controller to the endogenous distribution shift. The proposed method provides probabilistic safety guarantees while adapting to the evolving behavior of reactive, non-ego agents. We establish a model for the endogenous distribution shift and provide the conditions for the iterative conformal prediction pipeline to converge under such a distribution shift. We validate our framework in simulation for 2- and 3- agent interaction scenarios, demonstrating collision avoidance without resulting in overly conservative behavior and an overall improvement in success rates of up to 9.6% compared to other conformal prediction-based baselines.

Title: Beamspace Equalization for mmWave Massive MIMO: Algorithms and VLSI Implementations
Authors: Seyed Hadi Mirfarshbafan, Christoph Studer
Abstract: Massive multiuser multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) and millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication are key physical layer technologies in future wireless systems. Their deployment, however, is expected to incur excessive baseband processing hardware cost and power consumption. Beamspace processing leverages the channel sparsity at mmWave frequencies to reduce baseband processing complexity. In this paper, we review existing beamspace data detection algorithms and propose new algorithms as well as corresponding VLSI architectures that reduce data detection power. We present VLSI implementation results for the proposed architectures in a 22nm FDSOI process. Our results demonstrate that a fully-parallelized implementation of the proposed complex sparsity-adaptive equalizer (CSPADE) achieves up to 54% power savings compared to antenna-domain equalization. Furthermore, our fully-parallelized designs achieve the highest reported throughput among existing massive MIMO data detectors, while achieving better energy and area efficiency. We also present a sequential multiply-accumulate (MAC)-based architecture for CSPADE, which enables even higher power savings, i.e., up to 66%, compared to a MAC-based antenna-domain equalizer.

Title: WetExplorer: Automating Wetland Greenhouse-Gas Surveys with an Autonomous Mobile Robot
Authors: Jose Vasquez, Xuping Zhang
Abstract: Quantifying greenhouse-gases (GHG) in wetlands is critical for climate modeling and restoration assessment, yet manual sampling is labor-intensive, and time demanding. We present WetExplorer, an autonomous tracked robot that automates the full GHG-sampling workflow. The robot system integrates low-ground-pressure locomotion, centimeter-accurate lift placement, dual-RTK sensor fusion, obstacle avoidance planning, and deep-learning perception in a containerized ROS2 stack. Outdoor trials verified that the sensor-fusion stack maintains a mean localization error of 1.71 cm, the vision module estimates object pose with 7 mm translational and 3° rotational accuracy, while indoor trials demonstrated that the full motion-planning pipeline positions the sampling chamber within a global tolerance of 70 mm while avoiding obstacles, all without human intervention. By eliminating the manual bottleneck, WetExplorer enables high-frequency, multi-site GHG measurements and opens the door for dense, long-duration datasets in saturated wetland terrain.

Title: Multi-Joint Physics-Informed Deep Learning Framework for Time-Efficient Inverse Dynamics
Authors: Shuhao Ma, Zeyi Huang, Yu Cao, Wesley Doorsamy, Chaoyang Shi, Jun Li, Zhi-Qiang Zhang
Abstract: Time-efficient estimation of muscle activations and forces across multi-joint systems is critical for clinical assessment and assistive device control. However, conventional approaches are computationally expensive and lack a high-quality labeled dataset for multi-joint applications. To address these challenges, we propose a physics-informed deep learning framework that estimates muscle activations and forces directly from kinematics. The framework employs a novel Multi-Joint Cross-Attention (MJCA) module with Bidirectional Gated Recurrent Unit (BiGRU) layers to capture inter-joint coordination, enabling each joint to adaptively integrate motion information from others. By embedding multi-joint dynamics, inter-joint coupling, and external force interactions into the loss function, our Physics-Informed MJCA-BiGRU (PI-MJCA-BiGRU) delivers physiologically consistent predictions without labeled data while enabling time-efficient inference. Experimental validation on two datasets demonstrates that PI-MJCA-BiGRU achieves performance comparable to conventional supervised methods without requiring ground-truth labels, while the MJCA module significantly enhances inter-joint coordination modeling compared to other baseline architectures.

Title: Synthetic Voices, Real Threats: Evaluating Large Text-to-Speech Models in Generating Harmful Audio
Authors: Guangke Chen, Yuhui Wang, Shouling Ji, Xiapu Luo, Ting Wang
Abstract: Modern text-to-speech (TTS) systems, particularly those built on Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs), generate high-fidelity speech that faithfully reproduces input text and mimics specified speaker identities. While prior misuse studies have focused on speaker impersonation, this work explores a distinct content-centric threat: exploiting TTS systems to produce speech containing harmful content. Realizing such threats poses two core challenges: (1) LALM safety alignment frequently rejects harmful prompts, yet existing jailbreak attacks are ill-suited for TTS because these systems are designed to faithfully vocalize any input text, and (2) real-world deployment pipelines often employ input/output filters that block harmful text and audio. We present HARMGEN, a suite of five attacks organized into two families that address these challenges. The first family employs semantic obfuscation techniques (Concat, Shuffle) that conceal harmful content within text. The second leverages audio-modality exploits (Read, Spell, Phoneme) that inject harmful content through auxiliary audio channels while maintaining benign textual prompts. Through evaluation across five commercial LALMs-based TTS systems and three datasets spanning two languages, we demonstrate that our attacks substantially reduce refusal rates and increase the toxicity of generated speech. We further assess both reactive countermeasures deployed by audio-streaming platforms and proactive defenses implemented by TTS providers. Our analysis reveals critical vulnerabilities: deepfake detectors underperform on high-fidelity audio; reactive moderation can be circumvented by adversarial perturbations; while proactive moderation detects 57-93% of attacks. Our work highlights a previously underexplored content-centric misuse vector for TTS and underscore the need for robust cross-modal safeguards throughout training and deployment.

Title: Modeling and Control of Sustainable Transitions through Opinion-Behavior Coupling in Heterogeneous Networks
Authors: Martina Alutto, Sofia Bellotti, Fabrizio Dabbene, Chiara Ravazzi
Abstract: Understanding how sustainable behaviors spread within heterogeneous societies requires the integration of behavioral data, social influence mechanisms, and structured approaches to control. In this paper, we propose a data-driven computational framework for coupled opinion-adoption dynamics in social systems. Each node in the multilayer network represents a community characterized by a specific age group and mobility level, derived from large-scale survey data on the predisposition to adopt electric vehicles in Northern Europe. The proposed model captures three mechanisms: behavioral contagion through social and informational diffusion, abandonment driven by dissatisfaction, and feedback between opinions and adoption levels through social influence. Analyzing the equilibrium points of the coupled system allows us to derive the conditions that enable large-scale adoption. We empirically calibrate the model using data to construct synthetic populations and social similarity networks, which we use to explore targeted interventions that promote sustainable transitions. Specifically, the analysis focuses on two types of control strategies: opinion-based policies, which act on the social network layer, and policies that aim to improve experience and reduce dissatisfaction. Simulation results show that the latter ensure more stable and long-term adoption, offering concrete insights for designing effective interventions in sociotechnical transitions toward sustainability.

Title: SplineSplat: 3D Ray Tracing for Higher-Quality Tomography
Authors: Youssef Haouchat, Sepand Kashani, Aleix Boquet-Pujadas, Philippe Thévenaz, Michael Unser
Abstract: We propose a method to efficiently compute tomographic projections of a 3D volume represented by a linear combination of shifted B-splines. To do so, we propose a ray-tracing algorithm that computes 3D line integrals with arbitrary projection geometries. One of the components of our algorithm is a neural network that computes the contribution of the basis functions efficiently. In our experiments, we consider well-posed cases where the data are sufficient for accurate reconstruction without the need for regularization. We achieve higher reconstruction quality than traditional voxel-based methods.

Title: Simulating an Autonomous System in CARLA using ROS 2
Authors: Joseph Abdo, Aditya Shibu, Moaiz Saeed, Abdul Maajid Aga, Apsara Sivaprazad, Mohamed Al-Musleh
Abstract: Autonomous racing offers a rigorous setting to stress test perception, planning, and control under high speed and uncertainty. This paper proposes an approach to design and evaluate a software stack for an autonomous race car in CARLA: Car Learning to Act simulator, targeting competitive driving performance in the Formula Student UK Driverless (FS-AI) 2025 competition. By utilizing a 360° light detection and ranging (LiDAR), stereo camera, global navigation satellite system (GNSS), and inertial measurement unit (IMU) sensor via ROS 2 (Robot Operating System), the system reliably detects the cones marking the track boundaries at distances of up to 35 m. Optimized trajectories are computed considering vehicle dynamics and simulated environmental factors such as visibility and lighting to navigate the track efficiently. The complete autonomous stack is implemented in ROS 2 and validated extensively in CARLA on a dedicated vehicle (ADS-DV) before being ported to the actual hardware, which includes the Jetson AGX Orin 64GB, ZED2i Stereo Camera, Robosense Helios 16P LiDAR, and CHCNAV Inertial Navigation System (INS).

Title: Synergy vs. Noise: Performance-Guided Multimodal Fusion For Biochemical Recurrence-Free Survival in Prostate Cancer
Authors: Seth Alain Chang, Muhammad Mueez Amjad, Noorul Wahab, Ethar Alzaid, Nasir Rajpoot, Adam Shephard
Abstract: Multimodal deep learning (MDL) has emerged as a transformative approach in computational pathology. By integrating complementary information from multiple data sources, MDL models have demonstrated superior predictive performance across diverse clinical tasks compared to unimodal models. However, the assumption that combining modalities inherently improves performance remains largely unexamined. We hypothesise that multimodal gains depend critically on the predictive quality of individual modalities, and that integrating weak modalities may introduce noise rather than complementary information. We test this hypothesis on a prostate cancer dataset with histopathology, radiology, and clinical data to predict time-to-biochemical recurrence. Our results confirm that combining high-performing modalities yield superior performance compared to unimodal approaches. However, integrating a poor-performing modality with other higher-performing modalities degrades predictive accuracy. These findings demonstrate that multimodal benefit requires selective, performance-guided integration rather than indiscriminate modality combination, with implications for MDL design across computational pathology and medical imaging.

Title: Proactive Hearing Assistants that Isolate Egocentric Conversations
Authors: Guilin Hu, Malek Itani, Tuochao Chen, Shyamnath Gollakota
Abstract: We introduce proactive hearing assistants that automatically identify and separate the wearer's conversation partners, without requiring explicit prompts. Our system operates on egocentric binaural audio and uses the wearer's self-speech as an anchor, leveraging turn-taking behavior and dialogue dynamics to infer conversational partners and suppress others. To enable real-time, on-device operation, we propose a dual-model architecture: a lightweight streaming model runs every 12.5 ms for low-latency extraction of the conversation partners, while a slower model runs less frequently to capture longer-range conversational dynamics. Results on real-world 2- and 3-speaker conversation test sets, collected with binaural egocentric hardware from 11 participants totaling 6.8 hours, show generalization in identifying and isolating conversational partners in multi-conversation settings. Our work marks a step toward hearing assistants that adapt proactively to conversational dynamics and engagement. More information can be found on our website: this https URL

Title: HetDAPAC: Leveraging Attribute Heterogeneity in Distributed Attribute-Based Private Access Control
Authors: Shreya Meel, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: Verifying user attributes to provide fine-grained access control to databases is fundamental to attribute-based authentication. Either a single (central) authority verifies all the attributes, or multiple independent authorities verify the attributes distributedly. In the central setup, the authority verifies all user attributes, and the user downloads only the authorized record. While this is communication efficient, it reveals all user attributes to the authority. A distributed setup prevents this privacy breach by letting each authority verify and learn only one attribute. Motivated by this, Jafarpisheh~et~al. introduced an information-theoretic formulation, called distributed attribute-based private access control (DAPAC). With $N$ non-colluding authorities (servers), $N$ attributes and $K$ possible values for each attribute, the DAPAC system lets each server learn only the single attribute value that it verifies, and is oblivious to the remaining $N-1$. The user retrieves its designated record, without learning anything about the remaining database records. The goal is to maximize the rate, i.e., the ratio of desired message size to total download size. However, not all attributes are sensitive, and DAPAC's privacy constraints can be too restrictive, negatively affecting the rate. To leverage the heterogeneous privacy requirements of user attributes, we propose heterogeneous (Het)DAPAC, a framework which off-loads verification of $N-D$ of the $N$ attributes to a central server, and retains DAPAC's architecture for the $D$ sensitive attributes. We first present a HetDAPAC scheme, which improves the rate from $\frac{1}{2K}$ to $\frac{1}{K+1}$, while sacrificing the privacy of a few non-sensitive attributes. Unlike DAPAC, our scheme entails a download imbalance across servers; we propose a second scheme achieving a balanced per-server download and a rate of $\frac{D+1}{2KD}$.

Title: Multistability of Self-Attention Dynamics in Transformers
Authors: Claudio Altafini
Abstract: In machine learning, a self-attention dynamics is a continuous-time multiagent-like model of the attention mechanisms of transformers. In this paper we show that such dynamics is related to a multiagent version of the Oja flow, a dynamical system that computes the principal eigenvector of a matrix corresponding for transformers to the value matrix. We classify the equilibria of the ``single-head'' self-attention system into four classes: consensus, bipartite consensus, clustering and polygonal equilibria. Multiple asymptotically stable equilibria from the first three classes often coexist in the self-attention dynamics. Interestingly, equilibria from the first two classes are always aligned with the eigenvectors of the value matrix, often but not exclusively with the principal eigenvector.

Abstract: We present TEyeD, the world's largest unified public data set of eye images taken with head-mounted devices. TEyeD was acquired with seven different head-mounted eye trackers. Among them, two eye trackers were integrated into virtual reality (VR) or augmented reality (AR) devices. The images in TEyeD were obtained from various tasks, including car rides, simulator rides, outdoor sports activities, and daily indoor activities. The data set includes 2D and 3D landmarks, semantic segmentation, 3D eyeball annotation and the gaze vector and eye movement types for all images. Landmarks and semantic segmentation are provided for the pupil, iris and eyelids. Video lengths vary from a few minutes to several hours. With more than 20 million carefully annotated images, TEyeD provides a unique, coherent resource and a valuable foundation for advancing research in the field of computer vision, eye tracking and gaze estimation in modern VR and AR applications.

Title: A Simple Detection and Identification Scheme For Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces
Authors: Aymen Khaleel, Recep Vural, Mehmet Cagri Ilter, Majid Gerami, Ertugrul Basar
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communication is one of the promising physical layer enabling technologies for the sixth generation (6G) wireless networks due to their unprecedented capabilities in shaping the wireless communication environment. RISs are modeled as passive objects that can not transmit or receive wireless signals. While the passiveness of these surfaces is a key advantage in terms of power consumption and implementation complexity, it limits their capability to interact with the other active components in the network. Specifically, unlike conventional base stations (BSs), which actively identify themselves to user equipment (UEs) by periodically sending pilot signals, RISs need to be detected from the UE side. This paper proposes a novel RIS identification (RIS- ID) scheme, enabling UEs to detect and uniquely identify RISs in their surrounding environment. Furthermore, to assess the proposed RIS-ID scheme, we propose two performance metrics: the false and miss detection probabilities. These probabilities are analytically derived and verified through computer simulations, revealing the effectiveness of the proposed RIS-ID scheme under different operating scenarios.

Title: Parking of Connected Automated Vehicles: Vehicle Control, Parking Assignment, and Multi-agent Simulation
Authors: Xu Shen, Yongkeun Choi, Alex Wong, Francesco Borrelli, Scott Moura, Soomin Woo
Abstract: This paper introduces a comprehensive approach to optimize parking efficiency for connected and Automated vehicle (CAVs) fleets. We present a multi-vehicle parking simulator, equipped with hierarchical path planning and collision avoidance capabilities for individual CAVs. The simulator is designed to capture the key decision-making processes in parking, from low-level vehicle control to high-level parking assignment, and it enables the effective assessment of parking strategies for large fleets of ground vehicles. We formulate and compare different strategic parking spot assignments to minimize a collective cost. While the proposed framework is designed to optimize various objective functions, we choose the total parking time for the experiment, as it directly reflects the congestion level and the cost associated with the parking efficiency. We validate the effectiveness of the proposed strategies through an empirical evaluation against a dataset of real-world parking lot dynamics, realizing a substantial reduction in parking time by up to 43.8%. This improvement is attributed to the synergistic benefits of driving automation, the utilization of shared infrastructure state data, the exclusion of pedestrian traffic, and the real-time computation of optimal parking spot allocation.

Title: Asymptotic Analysis of Synchronous Signal Processing
Authors: Marc Vilà-Insa, Jaume Riba
Abstract: This paper extends various theoretical results from stationary data processing to cyclostationary (CS) processes under a unified framework. We first derive their asymptotic eigenbasis, which provides a link between their Fourier and Karhunen-Loève (KL) expansions, through a unitary transformation dictated by the cyclic spectrum. By exploiting this connection and the optimalities offered by the KL representation, we study the asymptotic performance of smoothing, filtering and prediction of CS processes, without the need for deriving explicit implementations. We obtain minimum mean squared error expressions that depend on the cyclic spectrum and include classical limits based on the power spectral density as particular cases. We conclude this work by applying the results to a practical scenario, in order to quantify the achievable gains of synchronous signal processing.

Title: Meta-Learning for Adaptive Control with Automated Mirror Descent
Authors: Sunbochen Tang, Haoyuan Sun, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Adaptive control achieves concurrent parameter learning and stable control under uncertainties that are linearly parameterized with known nonlinear features. Nonetheless, it is often difficult to obtain such nonlinear features. To address this difficulty, recent progress has been made in integrating meta-learning with adaptive control to learn such nonlinear features from data. However, these meta-learning-based control methods rely on classical adaptation laws using gradient descent, which is confined to the Euclidean geometry. In this paper, we propose a novel method that combines meta-learning and adaptation laws based on mirror descent, a popular generalization of gradient descent, which takes advantage of the potentially non-Euclidean geometry of the parameter space. In our approach, meta-learning not only learns the nonlinear features but also searches for a suitable mirror-descent potential function that optimizes control performance. Through numerical simulations, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in learning efficient representations and real-time tracking control performance under uncertain dynamics.

Title: Rotatable and Movable Antenna-Enabled Near-Field Integrated Sensing and Communication
Authors: Yunan Sun, Hao Xu, Chongjun Ouyang, Hongwen Yang
Abstract: The aim of this article is to investigate the performance of near-field integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems using rotatable movable antennas (RMAs). In the proposed RMA-enabled system, the positions and rotations of antennas at the base station (BS) are dynamically adjusted to enhance both communication and sensing capabilities. Two designs are explored: i) a sensing-centric design that minimizes the Cram$\text{é}$r-Rao bound (CRB) with signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraints, and ii) a communication-centric design that maximizes the sum-rate with a CRB constraint. To solve the formulated optimization problems, two alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms are proposed capitalizing on the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) method and the particle swarm optimization (PSO) method. Numerical results demonstrate that: i) the proposed RMA-enabled system outperforms the conventional fixed-position antenna and non-rotatable movable antenna systems in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs and RMAs' rotations show a higher performance gain in communication-centric design; ii) the proposed optimization methods achieve the Pareto boundary in both sensing-centric and communication-centric designs.

Title: Efficient Image Restoration via Latent Consistency Flow Matching
Authors: Elad Cohen, Idan Achituve, Idit Diamant, Arnon Netzer, Hai Victor Habi
Abstract: Recent advances in generative image restoration (IR) have demonstrated impressive results. However, these methods are hindered by their substantial size and computational demands, rendering them unsuitable for deployment on edge devices. This work introduces ELIR, an Efficient Latent Image Restoration method. ELIR addresses the distortion-perception trade-off within the latent space and produces high-quality images using a latent consistency flow-based model. In addition, ELIR introduces an efficient and lightweight architecture. Consequently, ELIR is 4$\times$ smaller and faster than state-of-the-art diffusion and flow-based approaches for blind face restoration, enabling a deployment on resource-constrained devices. Comprehensive evaluations of various image restoration tasks and datasets show that ELIR achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods, effectively balancing distortion and perceptual quality metrics while significantly reducing model size and computational cost.

Title: Fast Finite-Time Sliding Mode Control for Chattering-Free Trajectory Tracking of Robotic Manipulators
Authors: Momammad Ali Ranjbar
Abstract: Achieving precise and efficient trajectory tracking in robotic arms remains a key challenge due to system uncertainties and chattering effects in conventional sliding mode control (SMC). This paper presents a chattering-free fast terminal sliding mode control (FTSMC) strategy for a three-degree-of-freedom (3-DOF) robotic arm, designed to enhance tracking accuracy and robustness while ensuring finite-time convergence. The control framework is developed using Newton-Euler dynamics, followed by a state-space representation that captures the system's angular position and velocity. By incorporating an improved sliding surface and a Lyapunov-based stability analysis, the proposed FTSMC effectively mitigates chattering while preserving the advantages of SMC, such as fast response and strong disturbance rejection. The controller's performance is rigorously evaluated through comparisons with conventional PD sliding mode control (PDSMC) and terminal sliding mode control (TSMC). Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves superior trajectory tracking performance, faster convergence, and enhanced stability compared to existing methods, making it a promising solution for high-precision robotic applications.

Title: SCReedSolo: A Secure and Robust LSB Image Steganography Framework with Randomized Symmetric Encryption and Reed-Solomon Coding
Authors: Syed Rifat Raiyan, Md. Hasanul Kabir
Abstract: Image steganography is an information-hiding technique that involves the surreptitious concealment of covert informational content within digital images. In this paper, we introduce ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$, a novel framework for concealing arbitrary binary data within images. Our approach synergistically leverages Random Shuffling, Fernet Symmetric Encryption, and Reed-Solomon Error Correction Codes to encode the secret payload, which is then discretely embedded into the carrier image using LSB (Least Significant Bit) Steganography. The combination of these methods addresses the vulnerability vectors of both security and resilience against bit-level corruption in the resultant stego-images. We show that our framework achieves a data payload of 3 bits per pixel for an RGB image, and mathematically assess the probability of successful transmission for the amalgamated $n$ message bits and $k$ error correction bits. Additionally, we find that ${\rm SCR{\small EED}S{\small OLO}}$ yields good results upon being evaluated with multiple performance metrics, successfully eludes detection by various passive steganalysis tools, and is immune to simple active steganalysis attacks. Our code and data are available at this https URL.

Title: Interpolation Conditions for Data Consistency and Prediction in Noisy Linear Systems
Authors: Martina Vanelli, Nima Monshizadeh, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We develop an interpolation-based framework for noisy linear systems with unknown system matrix with bounded norm (implying bounded growth or non-increasing energy), and bounded process noise energy. The proposed approach characterizes all trajectories consistent with the measured data and these prior bounds in a purely data-driven manner. This characterization enables data-consistency verification, inference, and one-step ahead prediction, which can be leveraged for safety verification and cost minimization. Ultimately, this work represents a preliminary step toward exploiting interpolation conditions in data-driven control, offering a systematic way to characterize trajectories consistent with a dynamical system within a given class and enabling their use in control design.

Title: Max-Min Fairness in Stacked Intelligent Metasurface-Aided Rate Splitting Networks
Authors: Abdullah Quran, Shimaa Naser, Maryam Tariq, Omar Alhussein, Sami Muhaidat
Abstract: This paper investigates a downlink multiuser multiple-input single-output system that integrates rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) with a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM) to enable wave-domain beamforming. Unlike conventional digital beamforming, the proposed system leverages the programmable phase shifts of the SIM to perform beamforming entirely in the wave domain. In contrast to existing literature, this work introduces a fairness-centric SIM-RSMA design that shifts the emphasis from maximizing sum-rate to ensuring fair allocation of resources. In particular, we formulate a max-min rate optimization problem that jointly optimizes transmit power coefficients at the base station and SIM phase shifts. Given the non-convex nature of this problem, we develop an alternating optimization framework, where the power allocation is optimized through successive convex approximation and SIM beamforming is optimized using the Riemannian conjugate gradient method. Simulation results indicate that combining SIM with RSMA yields superior max-min performance compared to its integration with space division multiple access or non-orthogonal multiple access.

Title: CO-VADA: A Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach for Fair Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Yun-Shao Tsai, Yi-Cheng Lin, Huang-Cheng Chou, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Bias in speech emotion recognition (SER) systems often stems from spurious correlations between speaker characteristics and emotional labels, leading to unfair predictions across demographic groups. Many existing debiasing methods require model-specific changes or demographic annotations, limiting their practical use. We present CO-VADA, a Confidence-Oriented Voice Augmentation Debiasing Approach that mitigates bias without modifying model architecture or relying on demographic information. CO-VADA identifies training samples that reflect bias patterns present in the training data and then applies voice conversion to alter irrelevant attributes and generate samples. These augmented samples introduce speaker variations that differ from dominant patterns in the data, guiding the model to focus more on emotion-relevant features. Our framework is compatible with various SER models and voice conversion tools, making it a scalable and practical solution for improving fairness in SER systems.

Title: Latent Motion Profiling for Annotation-free Cardiac Phase Detection in Adult and Fetal Echocardiography Videos
Authors: Yingyu Yang, Qianye Yang, Kangning Cui, Can Peng, Elena D'Alberti, Netzahualcoyotl Hernandez-Cruz, Olga Patey, Aris T. Papageorghiou, J. Alison Noble
Abstract: The identification of cardiac phase is an essential step for analysis and diagnosis of cardiac function. Automatic methods, especially data-driven methods for cardiac phase detection, typically require extensive annotations, which is time-consuming and labor-intensive. In this paper, we present an unsupervised framework for end-diastole (ED) and end-systole (ES) detection through self-supervised learning of latent cardiac motion trajectories from 4-chamber-view echocardiography videos. Our method eliminates the need for manual annotations, including ED and ES indices, segmentation, or volumetric measurements, by training a reconstruction model to encode interpretable spatiotemporal motion patterns. Evaluated on the EchoNet-Dynamic benchmark, the approach achieves mean absolute error (MAE) of 3 frames (58.3 ms) for ED and 2 frames (38.8 ms) for ES detection, matching state-of-the-art supervised methods. Extended to fetal echocardiography, the model demonstrates robust performance with MAE 1.46 frames (20.7 ms) for ED and 1.74 frames (25.3 ms) for ES, despite the fact that the fetal heart model is built using non-standardized heart views due to fetal heart positioning variability. Our results demonstrate the potential of the proposed latent motion trajectory strategy for cardiac phase detection in adult and fetal echocardiography. This work advances unsupervised cardiac motion analysis, offering a scalable solution for clinical populations lacking annotated data. Code will be released at this https URL.

Title: Graph Learning for Cooperative Cell-Free ISAC Systems: From Optimization to Estimation
Authors: Peng Jiang, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu
Abstract: Cell-free integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems have emerged as a promising paradigm for sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous high-rate data transmission and high-precision radar sensing through cooperative distributed access points (APs). Fully exploiting these capabilities requires a unified design that bridges system-level optimization with multi-target parameter estimation. This paper proposes an end-to-end graph learning approach to close this gap, modeling the entire cell-free ISAC network as a heterogeneous graph to jointly design the AP mode selection, user association, precoding, and echo signal processing for multi-target position and velocity estimation. In particular, we propose two novel heterogeneous graph learning frameworks: a dynamic graph learning framework and a lightweight mirror-based graph attention network (mirror-GAT) framework. The dynamic graph learning framework employs structural and temporal attention mechanisms integrated with a three-dimensional convolutional neural network (3D-CNN), enabling superior performance and robustness in cell-free ISAC environments. Conversely, the mirror-GAT framework significantly reduces computational complexity and signaling overhead through a bi-level iterative structure with share adjacency. Simulation results validate that both proposed graph-learning-based frameworks achieve significant improvements in multi-target position and velocity estimation accuracy compared to conventional heuristic and optimization-based designs. Particularly, the mirror-GAT framework demonstrates substantial reductions in computational time and signaling overhead, underscoring its suitability for practical deployments.

Title: Further Results on Safety-Critical Stabilization of Force-Controlled Nonholonomic Mobile Robots
Authors: Bo Wang, Tianyu Han, Guangwei Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we address the stabilization problem for force-controlled nonholonomic mobile robots under safety-critical constraints. We propose a continuous, time-invariant control law based on the gamma m-quadratic programming (gamma m-QP) framework, which unifies control Lyapunov functions (CLFs) and control barrier functions (CBFs) to enforce both stability and safety in the closed-loop system. For the first time, we construct a global, time-invariant, strict Lyapunov function for the closed-loop nonholonomic mobile robot full-dynamic system with a nominal stabilization controller in polar coordinates; this strict Lyapunov function then serves as the CLF in the QP design. Next, by exploiting the inherent cascaded structure of the vehicle dynamics, we develop a CBF for the mobile robot via an integrator backstepping procedure. Our main results guarantee both asymptotic stability and safety for the closed-loop system. Both the simulation and experimental results are presented to illustrate the effectiveness and performance of our approach.

Title: Network-Centric Anomaly Filtering and Spoofer localization for 5G-NR Localization in LAWNs
Authors: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Zhu Han, Yufei Zhao, Yong Liang Guan, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This paper investigates security vulnerabilities and countermeasures for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) Fifth Generation New Radio (5G-NR) Time Difference of Arrival (TDoA)-based unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) localization in low-altitude urban environments. We first optimize node selection strategies under Air to Ground (A2G) channel conditions, proving that optimal selection depends on UAV altitude and deployment density, and propose lightweight User Equipment (UE)-assisted approaches that reduce overhead while enhancing accuracy. Next, we then expose critical security vulnerabilities by introducing merged-peak spoofing attacks where rogue UAVs transmit multiple 5G-NR Positioning Reference Signalss (PRSs) that merge with legitimate signals, bypassing existing detection methods. Through theoretical modeling and sensitivity analysis, we quantify how synchronization quality and geometric factors determine spoofing success probability, thereby revealing fundamental weaknesses in current 3GPP positioning frameworks. To address these vulnerabilities, we design a network-centric anomaly detection framework at the Localization Management Function (LMF) using 3GPP-specified parameters, coupled with recursive gradient descent-based robust localization that filters anomalous data while estimating UAV position. Our unified framework simultaneously provides robust victim localization and spoofer localization, enabling active attacker attribution beyond passive defense. Extensive simulations validate the effectiveness of our optimization and security mechanisms for 3GPP-compliant UAV positioning.

Title: Low-Overhead CSI Prediction via Gaussian Process Regression
Authors: Syed Luqman Shah, Nurul Huda Mahmood, Italo Atzeni
Abstract: Accurate channel state information (CSI) is critical for current and next-generation multi-antenna systems. Yet conventional pilot-based estimators incur prohibitive overhead as antenna counts grow. In this paper, we address this challenge by developing a novel framework based on Gaussian process regression (GPR) that predicts full CSI from only a few observed entries, thereby reducing pilot overhead. The correlation between data points in GPR is defined by the covariance function, known as kernels. In the proposed GPR-based CSI estimation framework, we incorporate three kernels, i.e., radial basis function, Matérn, and rational quadratic, to model smooth and multi-scale spatial correlations derived from the antenna array geometry. The proposed approach is evaluated across Kronecker and Weichselberger channel models with three distinct pilot probing schemes. Results show that the proposed GPR with 50% pilot saving achieves the lowest prediction error, the highest empirical 95% credible-interval coverage, and the best preservation of mutual information relative to benchmarks. This enables up to 50% pilot reduction while preserving over 92% of the link capacity.

Title: Time-Optimal Model Predictive Control for Linear Systems with Multiplicative Uncertainties
Authors: Renato Quartullo, Andrea Garulli, Mirko Leomanni
Abstract: This paper presents a time-optimal Model Predictive Control (MPC) scheme for linear discrete-time systems subject to multiplicative uncertainties represented by interval matrices. To render the uncertainty propagation computationally tractable, the set-valued error system dynamics are approximated using a matrix-zonotope-based bounding operator. Recursive feasibility and finite-time convergence are ensured through an adaptive terminal constraint mechanism. A key advantage of the proposed approach is that all the necessary bounding sets can be computed offline, substantially reducing the online computational burden. The effectiveness of the method is illustrated via a numerical case study on an orbital rendezvous maneuver between two satellites.

Title: SPUR: A Plug-and-Play Framework for Integrating Spatial Audio Understanding and Reasoning into Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: S Sakshi, Vaibhavi Lokegaonkar, Neil Zhang, Ramani Duraiswami, Sreyan Ghosh, Dinesh Manocha, Lie Lu
Abstract: Spatial perception is central to auditory intelligence, enabling accurate understanding of real-world acoustic scenes and advancing human-level perception of the world around us. While recent large audio-language models (LALMs) show strong reasoning over complex audios, most operate on monaural inputs and lack the ability to capture spatial cues such as direction, elevation, and distance. We introduce SPUR, a lightweight, plug-in approach that equips LALMs with spatial perception through minimal architectural changes. SPUR consists of: (i) a First-Order Ambisonics (FOA) encoder that maps (W, X, Y, Z) channels to rotation-aware, listener-centric spatial features, integrated into target LALMs via a multimodal adapter; and (ii) SPUR-Set, a spatial QA dataset combining open-source FOA recordings with controlled simulations, emphasizing relative direction, elevation, distance, and overlap for supervised spatial reasoning. Fine-tuning our model on the SPUR-Set consistently improves spatial QA and multi-speaker attribution while preserving general audio understanding. SPUR provides a simple recipe that transforms monaural LALMs into spatially aware models. Extensive ablations validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Beyond Prime Farmland: Solar Siting Tradeoffs for Cost-Effective Decarbonization
Authors: Papa Yaw Owusu-Obeng, Mai Shi, Max Vanatta, Michael T. Craig
Abstract: The feasibility and cost-effectiveness of continued growth in solar photovoltaics are closely tied to siting decisions. But trade-offs between costs and technical potential between land categories, especially brownfields and rooftop sites, have not been quantified, despite increasing resistance to and policy interest in reducing use of greenfield sites (e.g., prime agricultural lands). We examine the effect of siting decisions across land types for utility-scale and rooftop PV on the feasibility and cost of meeting solar deployment targets across the Eastern U.S. We build a database of solar PV supply curves by land type for each county in the Eastern Interconnect (EI) region (~2,400 counties). Our supply curves quantify technical potential versus levelized cost across greenfield, brownfield, and rooftop land types. With these supply curves and a 2035 solar deployment target (435 GW) aligned with a decarbonized power system, we quantify cost and capacity trade-offs using scenarios that prioritize solar PV deployment on different land types. We find greenfield, particularly prime agriculture, sites offer the lowest levelized costs for meeting capacity targets, of 39 to 57 $/MWh. Contaminated lands, often prioritized in policy to reduce land use conflict, have limited technical potential and impose a cost premium of 14-33% relative to greenfield sites. Rooftop PV provides enough technical potential for meeting capacity targets but comes at consistently higher costs, with minimum LCOEs of roughly 70 $/MWh or well above the highest-cost greenfield sites. Our results detail heterogeneous siting trade-offs across the Eastern United States, enabling targeted policy design to meet deployment targets while balancing costs and land use conflicts.

Title: When the Correct Model Fails: The Optimality of Stackelberg Equilibria with Follower Intention Updates
Authors: Cayetana Salinas-Rodriguez, Jonathan Rogers, Sarah H.Q. Li
Abstract: We study a two-player dynamic Stackelberg game between a leader and a follower whose intention is unknown to the leader. Classical formulations of the Stackelberg equilibrium (SE) assume that the follower's best response (BR) function is known to the leader. However, this is not always true in practice. We study a setting in which the leader receives updated beliefs about the follower BR before the end of the game, such that the update prompts the leader and subsequently the follower to re-optimize their strategies. We characterize the optimality guarantees of the SE solutions under this belief update for both open loop and feedback information structures. Interestingly, we prove that in general, assuming an incorrect follower's BR can lead to more optimal leader costs over the entire game than knowing the true follower's BR. We support these results with numerical examples in a linear quadratic (LQ) Stackelberg game, and use Monte Carlo simulations to show that the instances of incorrect BR achieving lower leader costs are non-trivial in collision avoidance LQ Stackelberg games.

Title: Hierarchical Codebook based Multiuser Beam Training for Millimeter Wave Massive MIMO
Authors: Chenhao Qi, Kangjian Chen, Octavia A. Dobre, Geoffrey Ye Li
Abstract: In this paper, multiuser beam training based on hierarchical codebook for millimeter wave massive multi-input multi-output is investigated, where the base station (BS) simultaneously performs beam training with multiple user equipments (UEs). For the UEs, an alternative minimization method with a closed-form expression (AMCF) is proposed to design the hierarchical codebook under the constant modulus constraint. To speed up the convergence of the AMCF, an initialization method based on Zadoff-Chu sequence is proposed. For the BS, a simultaneous multiuser beam training scheme based on an adaptively designed hierarchical codebook is proposed, where the codewords in the current layer of the codebook are designed according to the beam training results of the previous layer. The codewords at the BS are designed with multiple mainlobes, each covering a spatial region for one or more UEs. Simulation results verify the effectiveness of the proposed hierarchical codebook design schemes and show that the proposed multiuser beam training scheme can approach the performance of the beam sweeping but with significantly reduced beam training overhead.

Title: Strong Duality in Risk-Constrained Nonconvex Functional Programming
Authors: Dionysis Kalogerias, Spyridon Pougkakiotis
Abstract: We show that a wide class of risk-constrained nonconvex functional optimization problems exhibit strong duality, regardless of nonconvexity. We develop two novel results under distinct sets of assumptions, establishing strong duality over both decomposable policy spaces (matching and extending prior work in the risk neutral case), and nondecomposable policy spaces with structure (e.g., continuity or smoothness), including certain universal finite-dimensional (fixed depth/width) neural network parametrizations as special cases (improving established results in the risk-neutral setting as well). We consider constraints featuring convex and positively homogeneous risk measures with bounded risk envelopes, generalizing expectations. Popular risk measures supported within our setting include the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR), the (even non-monotone) mean-absolute deviation (MAD), certain distributionally robust representations and more generally all real-valued coherent risk measures on the space $L_1$. We further discuss various generalizations of our base model, extensions for risk measures supported on $L_{p>1}$, implications in the context of mean-risk tradeoff models, as well as applications in wireless systems resource allocation, and supervised constrained learning. Our core proof technique appears to be new and relies on risk conjugate duality in tandem with J. J. Uhl's weak extension of A. A. Lyapunov's convexity theorem for vector measures taking values in infinite-dimensional Banach spaces.

Title: DiAReL: Reinforcement Learning with Disturbance Awareness for Robust Sim2Real Policy Transfer in Robot Control
Authors: Mohammadhossein Malmir (1), Josip Josifovski (1), Noah Klarmann (2), Alois Knoll (1) ((1) Department of Computer Engineering, School of Computation, Information and Technology, Technical University of Munich, (2) Rosenheim University of Applied Sciences)
Abstract: Delayed Markov decision processes (DMDPs) fulfill the Markov property by augmenting the state space of agents with a finite time window of recently committed actions. In reliance on these state augmentations, delay-resolved reinforcement learning algorithms train policies to learn optimal interactions with environments featuring observation or action delays. Although such methods can be directly trained on the real robots, due to sample inefficiency, limited resources, or safety constraints, a common approach is to transfer models trained in simulation to the physical robot. However, robotic simulations rely on approximated models of the physical systems, which hinders the sim2real transfer. In this work, we consider various uncertainties in modeling the robot or environment dynamics as unknown intrinsic disturbances applied to the system input. We introduce the disturbance-augmented Markov decision process (DAMDP) in delayed settings as a novel representation to incorporate disturbance estimation in training on-policy reinforcement learning algorithms. The proposed method is validated across several metrics on learning robotic reaching and pushing tasks and compared with disturbance-unaware baselines. The results show that the disturbance-augmented models can achieve higher stabilization and robustness in the control response, which in turn improves the prospects of successful sim2real transfer.

Title: EAST: Environment Aware Safe Tracking using Planning and Control Co-Design
Authors: Zhichao Li, Yinzhuang Yi, Zhuolin Niu, Nikolay Atanasov
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of autonomous mobile robot navigation in unknown environments with moving obstacles. We propose a new method to achieve environment-aware safe tracking (EAST) of robot motion plans that integrates an obstacle clearance cost for path planning, a convex reachable set for robot motion prediction, and safety constraints for dynamic obstacle avoidance. EAST adapts the motion of the robot according to the locally sensed environment geometry and dynamics, leading to fast motion in wide open areas and cautious behavior in narrow passages or near moving obstacles. Our control design uses a reference governor, a virtual dynamical system that guides the robot's motion and decouples the path tracking and safety objectives. While reference governor methods have been used for safe tracking control in static environments, our key contribution is an extension to dynamic environments using convex optimization with control barrier function (CBF) constraints. Thus, our work establishes a connection between reference governor techniques and CBF techniques for safe control in dynamic environments. We validate our approach in simulated and real-world environments, featuring complex obstacle configurations and natural dynamic obstacle motion.

Title: Fractured Glass, Failing Cameras: Simulating Physics-Based Adversarial Samples for Autonomous Driving Systems
Authors: Manav Prabhakar, Jwalandhar Girnar, Arpan Kusari
Abstract: While much research has recently focused on generating physics-based adversarial samples, a critical yet often overlooked category originates from physical failures within on-board cameras-components essential to the perception systems of autonomous vehicles. Camera failures, whether due to external stresses causing hardware breakdown or internal component faults, can directly jeopardize the safety and reliability of autonomous driving systems. Firstly, we motivate the study using two separate real-world experiments to showcase that indeed glass failures would cause the detection based neural network models to fail. Secondly, we develop a simulation-based study using the physical process of the glass breakage to create perturbed scenarios, representing a realistic class of physics-based adversarial samples. Using a finite element model (FEM)-based approach, we generate surface cracks on the camera image by applying a stress field defined by particles within a triangular mesh. Lastly, we use physically-based rendering (PBR) techniques to provide realistic visualizations of these physically plausible fractures. To assess the safety implications, we apply the simulated broken glass effects as image filters to two autonomous driving datasets- KITTI and BDD100K- as well as the large-scale image detection dataset MS-COCO. We then evaluate detection failure rates for critical object classes using CNN-based object detection models (YOLOv8 and Faster R-CNN) and a transformer-based architecture with Pyramid Vision Transformers. To further investigate the distributional impact of these visual distortions, we compute the Kullback-Leibler (K-L) divergence between three distinct data distributions, applying various broken glass filters to a custom dataset (captured through a cracked windshield), as well as the KITTI and Kaggle cats and dogs datasets.

Title: Protection Degree and Migration in the Stochastic SIRS Model: A Queueing System Perspective
Authors: Yuhan Li, Ziyan Zeng, Minyu Feng, Jürgen Kurths
Abstract: With the prevalence of COVID-19, the modeling of epidemic propagation and its analyses have played a significant role in controlling epidemics. However, individual behaviors, in particular the self-protection and migration, which have a strong influence on epidemic propagation, were always neglected in previous studies. In this paper, we mainly propose two models from the individual and population perspectives. In the first individual model, we introduce the individual protection degree that effectively suppresses the epidemic level as a stochastic variable to the SIRS model. In the alternative population model, an open Markov queueing network is constructed to investigate the individual number of each epidemic state, and we present an evolving population network via the migration of people. Besides, stochastic methods are applied to analyze both models. In various simulations, the infected probability, the number of individuals in each state and its limited distribution are demonstrated.

Title: Evolving Network Modeling Driven by the Degree Increase and Decrease Mechanism
Authors: Yuhan Li, Minyu Feng, Jürgen Kurths
Abstract: Ever since the Barabási-Albert (BA) scale-free network has been proposed, network modeling has been studied intensively in light of the network growth and the preferential attachment (PA). However, numerous real systems are featured with a dynamic evolution including network reduction in addition to network growth. In this paper, we propose a novel mechanism for evolving networks from the perspective of vertex degree. We construct a queueing system to describe the increase and decrease of vertex degree, which drives the network evolution. In our mechanism, the degree increase rate is regarded as a function positively correlated to the degree of a vertex, ensuring the preferential attachment in a new way. Degree distributions are investigated under two expressions of the degree increase rate, one of which manifests a ``long tail'', and another one varies with different values of parameters. In simulations, we compare our theoretical distributions with simulation results and also apply them to real networks, which presents the validity and applicability of our model.

Title: Cache-Aided MIMO Communications: DoF Analysis and Transmitter Optimization
Authors: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli
Abstract: Cache-aided MIMO communications aims to jointly exploit both coded caching~(CC) and spatial multiplexing gains to enhance communication efficiency. In this paper, we analyze both the achievable degrees of freedom~(DoF) under linear processing constraint and the finite-SNR performance of a MIMO-CC system with CC gain \(t\), where a server with \(L\) transmit antennas communicates with \(K\) users, each equipped with \(G\) receive antennas. We first demonstrate that the enhanced DoF of \(\max_{\beta, \Omega} \Omega \times \beta\) is achievable with linear processing, where the number of users \(\Omega\) served in each transmission is fine-tuned to maximize DoF, and \(\beta \le \min\big(G, \nicefrac{L \binom{\Omega-1}{t}}{\big(1 + (\Omega - t - 1)\binom{\Omega-1}{t}}\big)\big)\) represents the number of parallel streams decoded by each user. Then, we propose a new class of MIMO-CC schemes using a novel scheduling mechanism leveraging maximal multicasting opportunities to maximize delivery rates at given SNR levels while still adhering to linear processing constraints. This new class of schemes is paired with an efficient linear multicast beamformer design, resulting in a more practical, high-performance solution for integrating CC in future MIMO systems.

Title: Reconfigurable hydrostatics: Toward versatile and efficient load-bearing robotics
Authors: Jeff Denis, Frederic Laberge, Jean-Sebastien Plante, Alexandre Girard
Abstract: Wearable and legged robot designers face multiple challenges when choosing actuation. Traditional fully actuated designs using electric motors are multifunctional but oversized and inefficient for bearing conservative loads and for being backdrivable. Alternatively, quasi-passive and underactuated designs reduce the amount of motorization and energy storage, but are often designed for specific tasks. Designers of versatile and stronger wearable robots will face these challenges unless future actuators become very torque-dense, backdrivable and efficient This paper explores a design paradigm for addressing this issue: reconfigurable hydrostatics. We show that a hydrostatic actuator can integrate a passive force mechanism and a sharing mechanism in the fluid domain and still be multifunctional. First, an analytical study compares the effect of these two mechanisms on the motorization requirements in the context of a load-bearing exoskeleton. Then, the hydrostatic concept integrating these two mechanisms using hydraulic components is presented. A case study analysis shows the mass/efficiency/inertia benefits of the concept over a fully actuated one. Then, experiments are conducted on robotic legs to demonstrate that the actuator concept can meet the expected performance in terms of force tracking, versatility, and efficiency under controlled conditions. The proof-of-concept can track the vertical ground reaction force (GRF) profiles of walking, running, squatting, and jumping, and the energy consumption is 4.8x lower for walking. The transient force behaviors due to switching from one leg to the other are also analyzed along with some mitigation to improve them.

Title: Quantifying the Limits of Segmentation Foundation Models: Modeling Challenges in Segmenting Tree-Like and Low-Contrast Objects
Authors: Yixin Zhang, Nicholas Konz, Kevin Kramer, Maciej A. Mazurowski
Abstract: Image segmentation foundation models (SFMs) like Segment Anything Model (SAM) have achieved impressive zero-shot and interactive segmentation across diverse domains. However, they struggle to segment objects with certain structures, particularly those with dense, tree-like morphology and low textural contrast from their surroundings. These failure modes are crucial for understanding the limitations of SFMs in real-world applications. To systematically study this issue, we introduce interpretable metrics quantifying object tree-likeness and textural separability. On carefully controlled synthetic experiments and real-world datasets, we show that SFM performance (\eg, SAM, SAM 2, HQ-SAM) noticeably correlates with these factors. We attribute these failures to SFMs misinterpreting local structure as global texture, resulting in over-segmentation or difficulty distinguishing objects from similar backgrounds. Notably, targeted fine-tuning fails to resolve this issue, indicating a fundamental limitation. Our study provides the first quantitative framework for modeling the behavior of SFMs on challenging structures, offering interpretable insights into their segmentation capabilities.

Title: Mining--Gym: A Configurable RL Benchmarking Environment for Truck Dispatch Scheduling
Authors: Chayan Banerjee, Kien Nguyen, Clinton Fookes
Abstract: Optimizing the mining process -- particularly truck dispatch scheduling -- is a key driver of efficiency in open-pit operations. However, the dynamic and stochastic nature of these environments, with uncertainties such as equipment failures, truck maintenance, and variable haul cycle times, challenges traditional optimization. While Reinforcement Learning (RL) shows strong potential for adaptive decision-making in mining logistics, practical deployment requires evaluation in realistic, customizable simulation environments. The lack of standardized benchmarking hampers fair algorithm comparison, reproducibility, and real-world applicability of RL solutions. To address this, we present Mining-Gym -- a configurable, open-source benchmarking environment for training, testing, and evaluating RL algorithms in mining process optimization. Built on Salabim-based Discrete Event Simulation (DES) and integrated with Gymnasium, Mining-Gym captures mining-specific uncertainties through an event-driven decision-point architecture. It offers a GUI for parameter configuration, data logging, and real-time visualization, supporting reproducible evaluation of RL strategies and heuristic baselines. We validate Mining-Gym by comparing classical heuristics with RL-based scheduling across six scenarios from normal operation to severe equipment failures. Results show it is an effective, reproducible testbed, enabling fair evaluation of adaptive decision-making and demonstrating the strong performance potential of RL-trained schedulers.

Title: Optimal Modified Feedback Strategies in LQ Games under Control Imperfections
Authors: Mahdis Rabbani, Navid Mojahed, Shima Nazari
Abstract: Game-theoretic approaches and Nash equilibrium have been widely applied across various engineering domains. However, practical challenges such as disturbances, delays, and actuator limitations can hinder the precise execution of Nash equilibrium strategies. This work investigates the impact of such implementation imperfections on game trajectories and players' costs in the context of a two-player finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) nonzero-sum game. Specifically, we analyze how small deviations by one player, measured or estimated at each stage, affect the state and cost function of the other player. To mitigate these effects, we propose an adjusted control policy that optimally compensates for the deviations under the stated information structure and can, under certain conditions, exploit them to improve performance. Rigorous mathematical analysis and proofs are provided, and the effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated through a representative numerical example.

Title: MUDAS: Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation in Multi-label Sound Classification
Authors: Jihoon Yun, Chengzhang Li, Dhrubojyoti Roy, Anish Arora
Abstract: Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) is essential for adapting machine learning models to new, unlabeled environments where data distribution shifts can degrade performance. Existing UDA algorithms are designed for single-label tasks and rely on significant computational resources, limiting their use in multi-label scenarios and in resource-constrained IoT devices. Overcoming these limitations is particularly challenging in contexts such as urban sound classification, where overlapping sounds and varying acoustics require robust, adaptive multi-label capabilities on low-power, on-device systems. To address these limitations, we introduce Mote-scale Unsupervised Domain Adaptation for Sounds (MUDAS), a UDA framework developed for multi-label sound classification in resource-constrained IoT settings. MUDAS efficiently adapts models by selectively retraining the classifier in situ using high-confidence data, minimizing computational and memory requirements to suit on-device deployment. Additionally, MUDAS incorporates class-specific adaptive thresholds to generate reliable pseudo-labels and applies diversity regularization to improve multi-label classification accuracy. In evaluations on the SONYC Urban Sound Tagging (SONYC-UST) dataset recorded at various New York City locations, MUDAS demonstrates notable improvements in classification accuracy over existing UDA algorithms, achieving good performance in a resource-constrained IoT setting.

Title: A Single-Chain Backscatter Tag for Multi-Sensor Multiplexing
Authors: Yijie Li, Weichong Ling, Taiting Lu, Bao Dao, Yi-Chao Chen, Vaishnavi Ranganathan, Lili Qiu, Jingxian Wang
Abstract: Many real-world sensing tasks require co-located, multi-modal measurements at a single site, typically a bundle of two to five sensors, for example, in plant stress sensing and blood pressure estimation. RF-backscatter devices have emerged as a low-power solution for sensing, yet existing backscatter tags support a single sensor. Placing several single-sensor tags at one site increases attachment footprint and induces mutual coupling between nearby tag antennas, thereby limiting practical deployment. We present MATRIX, a single-chain multi-sensor backscatter tag that concurrently supports multiple onboard sensors and multiplexes them as a composite voltage, then backscatters it through one analog modulation chain. Rather than time-division polling, which introduces inter-sensor sampling offsets, or frequency-division, which requires independent per-sensor modulation chains, MATRIX introduces a voltage-division multiplexing architecture in which each sensor value is encoded as a PWM waveform, carrying the measurement in its duty cycle and reserving the amplitude for multiplexing. To support reliable demultiplexing, MATRIX selects the voltage-division weights in a binary-weighted geometric progression so that every active-sensor set maps to a uniquely invertible, well-spaced composite voltage. The composite voltage is then converted into backscatter frequency shifts through a single modulation chain. At the receiver, MATRIX formulates demultiplexing as a Hidden Markov Model to recover per-sensor readings while tolerating analog hardware imperfections and multipath. MATRIX's ASIC design consumes 25.56uW. Detailed evaluation shows that the prototype, multiplexing five sensors, achieves 20 dB average signal reconstruction SNR at a 30 kHz sampling frequency; we further validate MATRIX with case studies in plant sensing, health monitoring, and microphone-based direction finding.

Title: StreamDiT: Real-Time Streaming Text-to-Video Generation
Authors: Akio Kodaira, Tingbo Hou, Ji Hou, Markos Georgopoulos, Felix Juefei-Xu, Masayoshi Tomizuka, Yue Zhao
Abstract: Recently, great progress has been achieved in text-to-video (T2V) generation by scaling transformer-based diffusion models to billions of parameters, which can generate high-quality videos. However, existing models typically produce only short clips offline, restricting their use cases in interactive and real-time applications. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing StreamDiT, a streaming video generation model. StreamDiT training is based on flow matching by adding a moving buffer. We design mixed training with different partitioning schemes of buffered frames to boost both content consistency and visual quality. StreamDiT modeling is based on adaLN DiT with varying time embedding and window attention. To practice the proposed method, we train a StreamDiT model with 4B parameters. In addition, we propose a multistep distillation method tailored for StreamDiT. Sampling distillation is performed in each segment of a chosen partitioning scheme. After distillation, the total number of function evaluations (NFEs) is reduced to the number of chunks in a buffer. Finally, our distilled model reaches real-time performance at 16 FPS on one GPU, which can generate video streams at 512p resolution. We evaluate our method through both quantitative metrics and human evaluation. Our model enables real-time applications, e.g. streaming generation, interactive generation, and video-to-video.

Lippincott, Ziqi Kang, Divya Sitani, Dave Bunten, Srijit Seal, Neil O. Carragher, Anne E. Carpenter, Shantanu Singh, Paula A. Marin Zapata, Juan C. Caicedo, Gregory P. Way
Abstract: For over two decades, image-based profiling has revolutionized cell phenotype analysis. Image-based profiling processes rich, high-throughput, microscopy data into thousands of unbiased measurements that reveal phenotypic patterns powerful for drug discovery, functional genomics, and cell state classification. Here, we review the evolving computational landscape of image-based profiling, detailing the bioinformatics processes involved from feature extraction to normalization and batch correction. We discuss how deep learning has fundamentally reshaped the field. We examine key methodological advancements, such as single-cell analysis, the development of robust similarity metrics, and the expansion into new modalities like optical pooled screening, temporal imaging, and 3D organoid profiling. We also highlight the growth of public benchmarks and open-source software ecosystems as a key driver for fostering reproducibility and collaboration. Despite these advances, the field still faces substantial challenges, particularly in developing methods for emerging temporal and 3D data modalities, establishing robust quality control standards and workflows, and interpreting the processed features. By focusing on the technical evolution of image-based profiling rather than the wide-ranging biological applications, our aim with this review is to provide researchers with a roadmap for navigating the progress and new challenges in this rapidly advancing domain.

Title: Progress in SPECT and PET Reconstruction for Theranostics: From Diagnosis to Therapy
Authors: Kweku Enninful, Fardeen Ahmed, Bradley Girod, Richard Laforest, Daniel L. J. Thorek, Vikas Prasad, Abhinav K. Jha
Abstract: The theranostic paradigm enables personalization of treatment by selecting patients with a diagnostic radiopharmaceutical and monitoring therapy using a matched therapeutic isotope. This strategy relies on accurate image reconstruction of both pretherapy and post-therapy images for patient selection and monitoring treatment. However, traditional reconstruction methods are hindered by challenges such as crosstalk in multi-isotope imaging and extremely low-count measurements data when imaging of alpha-emitting isotopes. Additionally, to fully realize the benefits of new imaging systems being developed for theranostic applications, advanced reconstruction techniques are needed. This review highlights recent progress and discusses critical challenges and unmet needs in theranostic image reconstruction.

Title: Adaptive Pareto-Optimal Token Merging for Edge Transformer Models in Semantic Communication
Authors: Omar Erak, Omar Alhussein, Hatem Abou-Zeid, Mehdi Bennis
Abstract: Large-scale transformer models have emerged as a powerful tool for semantic communication systems, enabling edge devices to extract rich representations for robust inference across noisy wireless channels. However, their substantial computational demands remain a major barrier to practical deployment in resource-constrained 6G networks. In this paper, we present a training-free framework for adaptive token merging in pretrained vision transformers to jointly reduce inference time and transmission resource usage. We formulate the selection of per-layer merging proportions as a multi-objective optimization problem to balance accuracy and computational cost. We employ Gaussian process-based Bayesian optimization to construct a Pareto frontier of optimal configurations, enabling flexible runtime adaptation to dynamic application requirements and channel conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method consistently outperforms other baselines and achieves significant reductions in floating-point operations while maintaining competitive accuracy across a wide range of signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. Additional results highlight the effectiveness of adaptive policies that adjust merging aggressiveness in response to channel quality, providing a practical mechanism to trade off latency and semantic fidelity on demand. These findings establish a scalable and efficient approach for deploying transformer-based semantic communication in future edge intelligence systems.

Title: Enhancing the NAO: Extending Capabilities of Legacy Robots for Long-Term Research
Authors: Austin Wilson, Sahar Kapasi, Zane Greene, Alexis E. Block
Abstract: Legacy (unsupported) robotic platforms often lose research utility when manufacturer support ends, preventing integration of modern sensing, speech, and interaction capabilities. We present the Enhanced NAO, a revitalized version of Aldebaran's NAO robot featuring upgraded beamforming microphones, RGB-D and thermal cameras, and additional compute resources in a fully self-contained package. This system combines cloud-based and local models for perception and dialogue, while preserving the NAO's expressive body and behaviors. In a pilot user study validating conversational performance, the Enhanced NAO delivered significantly higher conversational quality and elicited stronger user preference compared to the NAO AI Edition, without increasing response latency. The added visual and thermal sensing modalities established a foundation for future perception-driven interaction. Beyond this implementation, our framework provides a platform-agnostic strategy for extending the lifespan and research utility of legacy robots, ensuring they remain valuable tools for human-robot interaction.

Title: Golden Tonnetz
Authors: Yusuke Imai
Abstract: For example, in the chromatic circle, the twelve tones are represented by twelve points on a circle, and in Tonnetz, the relationships among harmonies are represented by a triangular lattice. Recently, we have shown that several arrangements of tones on the regular icosahedron can be associated with chromatic scales, whole-tone scales, major tones, and minor tones through the golden ratio. Here, we investigate another type of connection between music and the golden ratio. We show that there exists an arrangement of 7 tones on a golden triangle that can represent a given major/minor scale and its tonic, dominant, and subdominant chords by golden triangles. By applying this finding, we propose ``golden Tonnetz" which represents all the major/minor scales and triads by the golden triangles or gnomons and also represents relative, parallel, and leading-tone exchange transformations in Neo-Riemannian theory by transformations among the golden triangles and gnomons

Title: Melodia: Training-Free Music Editing Guided by Attention Probing in Diffusion Models
Authors: Yi Yang, Haowen Li, Tianxiang Li, Boyu Cao, Xiaohan Zhang, Liqun Chen, Qi Liu
Abstract: Text-to-music generation technology is progressing rapidly, creating new opportunities for musical composition and editing. However, existing music editing methods often fail to preserve the source music's temporal structure, including melody and rhythm, when altering particular attributes like instrument, genre, and mood. To address this challenge, this paper conducts an in-depth probing analysis on attention maps within AudioLDM 2, a diffusion-based model commonly used as the backbone for existing music editing methods. We reveal a key finding: cross-attention maps encompass details regarding distinct musical characteristics, and interventions on these maps frequently result in ineffective modifications. In contrast, self-attention maps are essential for preserving the temporal structure of the source music during its conversion into the target music. Building upon this understanding, we present Melodia, a training-free technique that selectively manipulates self-attention maps in particular layers during the denoising process and leverages an attention repository to store source music information, achieving accurate modification of musical characteristics while preserving the original structure without requiring textual descriptions of the source music. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to better evaluate music editing methods. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of textual adherence and structural integrity across various datasets. This research enhances comprehension of internal mechanisms within music generation models and provides improved control for music creation.
