Title: SSL-SE-EEG: A Framework for Robust Learning from Unlabeled EEG Data with Self-Supervised Learning and Squeeze-Excitation Networks
Authors: Meghna Roy Chowdhury, Yi Ding, Shreyas Sen
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) plays a crucial role in brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and neurological diagnostics, but its real-world deployment faces challenges due to noise artifacts, missing data, and high annotation costs. We introduce SSL-SE-EEG, a framework that integrates Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) with Squeeze-and-Excitation Networks (SE-Nets) to enhance feature extraction, improve noise robustness, and reduce reliance on labeled data. Unlike conventional EEG processing techniques, SSL-SE-EEG} transforms EEG signals into structured 2D image representations, suitable for deep learning. Experimental validation on MindBigData, TUH-AB, SEED-IV and BCI-IV datasets demonstrates state-of-the-art accuracy (91% in MindBigData, 85% in TUH-AB), making it well-suited for real-time BCI applications. By enabling low-power, scalable EEG processing, SSL-SE-EEG presents a promising solution for biomedical signal analysis, neural engineering, and next-generation BCIs.

Title: Low-Latency Neural Inference on an Edge Device for Real-Time Handwriting Recognition from EEG Signals
Authors: Ovishake Sen, Raghav Soni, Darpan Virmani, Akshar Parekh, Patrick Lehman, Sarthak Jena, Adithi Katikhaneni, Adam Khalifa, Baibhab Chatterjee
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) offer a pathway to restore communication for individuals with severe motor or speech impairments. Imagined handwriting provides an intuitive paradigm for character-level neural decoding, bridging the gap between human intention and digital communication. While invasive approaches such as electrocorticography (ECoG) achieve high accuracy, their surgical risks limit widespread adoption. Non-invasive electroencephalography (EEG) offers safer and more scalable alternatives but suffers from low signal-to-noise ratio and spatial resolution, constraining its decoding precision. This work demonstrates that advanced machine learning combined with informative EEG feature extraction can overcome these barriers, enabling real-time, high-accuracy neural decoding on portable edge devices. A 32-channel EEG dataset was collected from fifteen participants performing imagined handwriting. Signals were preprocessed with bandpass filtering and artifact subspace reconstruction, followed by extraction of 85 time-, frequency-, and graphical-domain features. A hybrid architecture, EEdGeNet, integrates a Temporal Convolutional Network with a multilayer perceptron trained on the extracted features. When deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson TX2, the system achieved 89.83 percent accuracy with 914.18 ms per-character latency. Selecting only ten key features reduced latency by 4.5 times to 202.6 ms with less than 1 percent loss in accuracy. These results establish a pathway for accurate, low-latency, and fully portable non-invasive BCIs supporting real-time communication.

Title: Excitation of Looped Bistable Bands for High-Speed Linear Actuation
Authors: Sareum Kim, Josie Hughes
Abstract: Soft robotics increasingly relies on smart materials and innovative structures, with bistable tape springs emerging as a promising option. These structures exhibit intriguing dynamic behaviors, such as oscillation, due to their inherent bistability. This paper explores the high-speed linear amplification of motion achieved through the excitation of a looped bistable tape spring. When looped, the tape spring forms two distinct joints, facilitating smooth oscillation. Mounted on a linear guide and driven by a crank mechanism with varying frequency, the system converts input oscillations into amplified linear motion at resonance. This study highlights the potential of bistable tape springs high speed reciprocating linear motion.

Title: Foveated Compression for Immersive Telepresence Visualization
Authors: Max Schwarz, Sven Behnke
Abstract: Immersive televisualization is important both for telepresence and teleoperation, but resolution and fidelity are often limited by communication bandwidth constraints. We propose a lightweight method for foveated compression of immersive televisualization video streams that can be easily integrated with common video codecs, reducing the required bandwidth if eye tracking data is available. Specifically, we show how to spatially adjust the Quantization Parameter of modern block-based video codecs in a adaptive way based on eye tracking information. The foveal region is transmitted with high fidelity while quality is reduced in the peripheral region, saving bandwidth. We integrate our method with the NimbRo avatar system, which won the ANA Avatar XPRIZE competition. Our experiments show that bandwidth can be reduced to a third without sacrificing immersion. We analyze transmission fidelity with qualitative examples and report quantitative results.

Title: Multi-Resolution Analysis of the Convective Structure of Tropical Cyclones for Short-Term Intensity Guidance
Authors: Elizabeth Cucuzzella, Tria McNeely, Kimberly Wood, Ann B. Lee
Abstract: Accurate tropical cyclone (TC) short-term intensity forecasting with a 24-hour lead time is essential for disaster mitigation in the Atlantic TC basin. Since most TCs evolve far from land-based observing networks, satellite imagery is critical to monitoring these storms; however, these complex and high-resolution spatial structures can be challenging to qualitatively interpret in real time by forecasters. Here we propose a concise, interpretable, and descriptive approach to quantify fine TC structures with a multi-resolution analysis (MRA) by the discrete wavelet transform, enabling data analysts to identify physically meaningful structural features that strongly correlate with rapid intensity change. Furthermore, deep-learning techniques can build on this MRA for short-term intensity guidance.

Title: Visible Iris Area as a Quality Metric for Reliable Iris Recognition Under Pupil Dilation and Eyelid Occlusion
Authors: Jack Pessaud, Eric Moran, John Nguyen, Joel Palko
Abstract: With the increasing adoption of iris recognition systems and the expansion of large-scale enrollment databases, there is a growing need to efficiently assess iris image quality at the time of acquisition, particularly to model user non-compliance in real time. Image quality may degrade due to eyelid occlusion or pupil dilation. Although previous studies have shown that occlusion and changes in the pupil-to-iris ratio negatively impact recognition performance, these investigations were typically limited by small sample sizes and did not examine the combined effects of eyelid and pupil variations. In this study, we analyze both dilation and eyelid occlusion using a large dataset of 555 distinct irises and demonstrate a strong correlation between probe image visible iris area and the Hamming distance of iris code pairs. These results suggest that visible iris area is a robust indicator of probe image quality and could be efficiently incorporated into the iris acquisition process to improve confidence in match predictions.

Title: Seed3D 1.0: From Images to High-Fidelity Simulation-Ready 3D Assets
Authors: Jiashi Feng, Xiu Li, Jing Lin, Jiahang Liu, Gaohong Liu, Weiqiang Lou, Su Ma, Guang Shi, Qinlong Wang, Jun Wang, Zhongcong Xu, Xuanyu Yi, Zihao Yu, Jianfeng Zhang, Yifan Zhu, Rui Chen, Jinxin Chi, Zixian Du, Li Han, Lixin Huang, Kaihua Jiang, Yuhan Li, Guan Luo, Shuguang Wang, Qianyi Wu, Fan Yang, Junyang Zhang, Xuanmeng Zhang
Abstract: Developing embodied AI agents requires scalable training environments that balance content diversity with physics accuracy. World simulators provide such environments but face distinct limitations: video-based methods generate diverse content but lack real-time physics feedback for interactive learning, while physics-based engines provide accurate dynamics but face scalability limitations from costly manual asset creation. We present Seed3D 1.0, a foundation model that generates simulation-ready 3D assets from single images, addressing the scalability challenge while maintaining physics rigor. Unlike existing 3D generation models, our system produces assets with accurate geometry, well-aligned textures, and realistic physically-based materials. These assets can be directly integrated into physics engines with minimal configuration, enabling deployment in robotic manipulation and simulation training. Beyond individual objects, the system scales to complete scene generation through assembling objects into coherent environments. By enabling scalable simulation-ready content creation, Seed3D 1.0 provides a foundation for advancing physics-based world simulators. Seed3D 1.0 is now available on this https URL

Title: MATLAB-Simulated Dataset for Automatic Modulation Classification in Wireless Fading Channels
Authors: M.M. Sadman Shafi, Tasnia Siddiqua Ahona, Ashraful Islam Mridha
Abstract: Accurate modulation classification is a core challenge in cognitive radio, adaptive communications, spectrum analysis, and related domains, especially under dynamic channels without transmitter knowledge. To address this need, this article presents a labeled synthetic dataset designed for wireless modulation classification under realistic propagation scenarios. The signals were generated in MATLAB by modulating randomly generated bitstreams using five digital modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16-QAM, 64-QAM, and 256-QAM. These signals were then transmitted through Rayleigh and Rician fading channels with standardized parameters, along with additional impairments to enhance realism and diversity. Each modulated signal contains 1000 symbols. A comprehensive set of features was extracted from the signals, encompassing statistical, time-domain, frequency-domain, spectrogram-based, spectral correlation-based, and image-processing-based descriptors such as BRISK, MSER, and GLCM. The dataset is organized into 10 CSV files covering two channel types (Rayleigh and Rician) across five sampling frequencies: 1 MHz, 10 MHz, 100 MHz, 500 MHz, and 1 GHz. To facilitate reproducibility and encourage further experimentation, the MATLAB scripts used for signal generation and feature extraction are also provided. This dataset serves as a valuable benchmark for developing and evaluating machine learning models in modulation classification, signal identification, and wireless communication research.

Title: IMAS$^2$: Joint Agent Selection and Information-Theoretic Coordinated Perception In Dec-POMDPs
Authors: Chongyang Shi, Wesley A. Suttle, Michael Dorothy, Jie Fu
Abstract: We study the problem of jointly selecting sensing agents and synthesizing decentralized active perception policies for the chosen subset of agents within a Decentralized Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (Dec-POMDP) framework. Our approach employs a two-layer optimization structure. In the inner layer, we introduce information-theoretic metrics, defined by the mutual information between the unknown trajectories or some hidden property in the environment and the collective partial observations in the multi-agent system, as a unified objective for active perception problems. We employ various optimization methods to obtain optimal sensor policies that maximize mutual information for distinct active perception tasks. In the outer layer, we prove that under certain conditions, the information-theoretic objectives are monotone and submodular with respect to the subset of observations collected from multiple agents. We then exploit this property to design an IMAS$^2$ (Information-theoretic Multi-Agent Selection and Sensing) algorithm for joint sensing agent selection and sensing policy synthesis. However, since the policy search space is infinite, we adapt the classical Nemhauser-Wolsey argument to prove that the proposed IMAS$^2$ algorithm can provide a tight $(1 - 1/e)$-guarantee on the performance. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in a multi-agent cooperative perception in a grid-world environment.

Title: NanoHydra: Energy-Efficient Time-Series Classification at the Edge
Authors: Cristian Cioflan, Jose Fonseca, Xiaying Wang, Luca Benini
Abstract: Time series classification (TSC) on extreme edge devices represents a stepping stone towards intelligent sensor nodes that preserve user privacy and offer real-time predictions. Resource-constrained devices require efficient TinyML algorithms that prolong the device lifetime of battery-operated devices without compromising the classification accuracy. We introduce NanoHydra, a TinyML TSC methodology relying on lightweight binary random convolutional kernels to extract meaningful features from data streams. We demonstrate our system on the ultra-low-power GAP9 microcontroller, exploiting its eight-core cluster for the parallel execution of computationally intensive tasks. We achieve a classification accuracy of up to 94.47% on ECG5000 dataset, comparable with state-of-the-art works. Our efficient NanoHydra requires only 0.33 ms to accurately classify a 1-second long ECG signal. With a modest energy consumption of 7.69 uJ per inference, 18x more efficient than the state-of-the-art, NanoHydra is suitable for smart wearable devices, enabling a device lifetime of over four years.

Title: Approximate Model Predictive Control for Microgrid Energy Management via Imitation Learning
Authors: Changrui Liu, Shengling Shi, Anil Alan, Ganesh Kumar Venayagamoorthy, Bart De Schutter
Abstract: Efficient energy management is essential for reliable and sustainable microgrid operation amid increasing renewable integration. This paper proposes an imitation learning-based framework to approximate mixed-integer Economic Model Predictive Control (EMPC) for microgrid energy management. The proposed method trains a neural network to imitate expert EMPC control actions from offline trajectories, enabling fast, real-time decision making without solving optimization problems online. To enhance robustness and generalization, the learning process includes noise injection during training to mitigate distribution shift and explicitly incorporates forecast uncertainty in renewable generation and demand. Simulation results demonstrate that the learned policy achieves economic performance comparable to EMPC while only requiring $10\%$ of the computation time of optimization-based EMPC in practice.

Title: Semantic Communication for Task Execution and Data Reconstruction in Multi-User Scenarios
Authors: Maximilian H. V. Tillmann, Avinash Kankari, Carsten Bockelmann, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: Semantic communication has gained significant attention with the advances in machine learning. Most semantic communication works focus on either task execution or data reconstruction, with some recent works combining the two. In this work, we propose a semantic communication system for concurrent task execution and data reconstruction for a multi-user scenario, which we formulate as the maximization of mutual information. To investigate the trade-off between the two objectives, we formulate a joint objective as a convex combination of task execution and data reconstruction. We show that under specific assumptions, the \ac{SSIM} loss can be obtained from the mutual information maximization objective for data reconstruction, which takes human visual perception into account. Furthermore, for constant resource use, we show that by increasing the weight of the reconstruction objective up to a certain point, the task execution performance can be kept nearly constant, while the data reconstruction can be significantly improved.

Title: Safe Output-Feedback Adaptive Optimal Control of Affine Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Tochukwu E. Ogri, Muzaffar Qureshi, Zachary I. Bell, Wanjiku A. Makumi, Rushikesh Kamalapurkar
Abstract: In this paper, we develop a safe control synthesis method that integrates state estimation and parameter estimation within an adaptive optimal control (AOC) and control barrier function (CBF)-based control architecture. The developed approach decouples safety objectives from the learning objectives using a CBF-based guarding controller where the CBFs are robustified to account for the lack of full-state measurements. The coupling of this guarding controller with the AOC-based stabilizing control guarantees safety and regulation despite the lack of full state measurement. The paper leverages recent advancements in deep neural network-based adaptive observers to ensure safety in the presence of state estimation errors. Safety and convergence guarantees are provided using a Lyapunov-based analysis, and the effectiveness of the developed controller is demonstrated through simulation under mild excitation conditions.

Title: RIS-Aided mmWave O-RAN: Coverage Extension and User Mobility Handling
Authors: Tawfik Osman, Aditya S. Shekhawat, Abhradeep Roy, Georgios C. Trichopoulos, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RISs) can redirect electromagnetic waves to desired directions to enhance signal coverage and/or improve signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the user equipment (UE). We present the design, implementation, and evaluation of an RIS-assisted O-RAN 5G system operating in the FR2 millimeter wave (mmWave) frequency band. We first introduce the design of 1,024 element (32 $\times$ 32) 1-bit RIS operating at the 28 GHz band, utilizing a modular and scalable tiled architecture. Then we demonstrate how the O-RAN E2 interface can be leveraged to dynamically control RIS configurations without modifying standard 5G signaling procedures. To evaluate the RIS-assisted 5G system, we conducted extensive field trials in both indoor and outdoor environments. The results of the O-RAN link coverage trials show that the deployed RIS provides substantial received signal power gains, ranging from 9 to 20 dB and 6 to 18 dB in indoor and outdoors scenarios, respectively. Handling UE mobility in RIS-assisted systems is challenging due to the need for joint RIS and UE beam management. For that, we develop two UE mobility management algorithms and evaluate them in real-time operation using the RIS O-RAN testbed. These algorithms leverage the received signal power at the UE to jointly track and adapt the RIS and UE beams in real time as the UE moves. The findings draw important insights into the practical feasibility of integrating RIS into O-RAN systems to enhance coverage, mobility support, and link reliability in next-generation cellular networks.

Title: Signal Design for OTFS Dual-Functional Radar and Communications with Imperfect CSI
Authors: Borui Du, Yumeng Zhang, Christos Masouros, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) offers significant advantages in managing mobility for both wireless sensing and communication systems, making it a promising candidate for dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC). However, the optimal signal design that fully exploits OTFS's potential in DFRC has not been sufficiently explored. This paper addresses this gap by formulating an optimization problem for signal design in DFRC-OTFS, incorporating both pilot-symbol design for channel estimation and data-power allocation. Specifically, we employ the integrated sidelobe level (ISL) of the ambiguity function as a radar metric, accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. For communication, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. We maximize the weighted sum of sensing and communication metrics and solve the optimization problem via an alternating optimization framework. Simulations indicate that the proposed signal significantly improves the sensing-communication performance region compared with conventional signal schemes, achieving at least a 9.44 dB gain in ISL suppression for sensing, and a 4.82 dB gain in the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) for communication.

Title: SpeechAgent: An End-to-End Mobile Infrastructure for Speech Impairment Assistance
Authors: Haowei Lou, Chengkai Huang, Hye-young Paik, Yongquan Hu, Aaron Quigley, Wen Hu, Lina Yao
Abstract: Speech is essential for human communication, yet millions of people face impairments such as dysarthria, stuttering, and aphasia conditions that often lead to social isolation and reduced participation. Despite recent progress in automatic speech recognition (ASR) and text-to-speech (TTS) technologies, accessible web and mobile infrastructures for users with impaired speech remain limited, hindering the practical adoption of these advances in daily communication. To bridge this gap, we present SpeechAgent, a mobile SpeechAgent designed to facilitate people with speech impairments in everyday communication. The system integrates large language model (LLM)- driven reasoning with advanced speech processing modules, providing adaptive support tailored to diverse impairment types. To ensure real-world practicality, we develop a structured deployment pipeline that enables real-time speech processing on mobile and edge devices, achieving imperceptible latency while maintaining high accuracy and speech quality. Evaluation on real-world impaired speech datasets and edge-device latency profiling confirms that SpeechAgent delivers both effective and user-friendly performance, demonstrating its feasibility for personalized, day-to-day assistive communication.

Title: Interpolatory Approximations of PMU Data: Dimension Reduction and Pilot Selection
Authors: Sean Reiter, Mark Embree, Serkan Gugercin, Vassilis Kekatos
Abstract: This work investigates the reduction of phasor measurement unit (PMU) data through low-rank matrix approximations. To reconstruct a PMU data matrix from fewer measurements, we propose the framework of interpolatory matrix decompositions (IDs). In contrast to methods relying on principal component analysis or singular value decomposition, IDs recover the complete data matrix using only a few of its rows (PMU datastreams) and/or a few of its columns (snapshots in time). This compression enables the real-time monitoring of power transmission systems using a limited number of measurements, thereby minimizing communication bandwidth. The ID perspective gives a rigorous error bound on the quality of the data compression. We propose selecting rows and columns used in an ID via the discrete empirical interpolation method (DEIM), a greedy algorithm that aims to control the error bound. This bound leads to a computable estimate for the reconstruction error during online operations. A violation of this estimate suggests a change in the system's operating conditions, and thus serves as a tool for fault detection. Numerical tests using synthetic PMU data illustrate DEIM's excellent performance for data compression, and validate the proposed DEIM-based fault-detection method.

Title: Active Localization of Close-range Adversarial Acoustic Sources for Underwater Data Center Surveillance
Authors: Adnan Abdullah, David Blow, Sara Rampazzi, Md Jahidul Islam
Abstract: Underwater data infrastructures offer natural cooling and enhanced physical security compared to terrestrial facilities, but are susceptible to acoustic injection attacks that can disrupt data integrity and availability. This work presents a comprehensive surveillance framework for localizing and tracking close-range adversarial acoustic sources targeting offshore infrastructures, particularly underwater data centers (UDCs). We propose a heterogeneous receiver configuration comprising a fixed hydrophone mounted on the facility and a mobile hydrophone deployed on a dedicated surveillance robot. While using enough arrays of static hydrophones covering large infrastructures is not feasible in practice, off-the-shelf approaches based on time difference of arrival (TDOA) and frequency difference of arrival (FDOA) filtering fail to generalize for this dynamic configuration. To address this, we formulate a Locus-Conditioned Maximum A-Posteriori (LC-MAP) scheme to generate acoustically informed and geometrically consistent priors, ensuring a physically plausible initial state for a joint TDOA-FDOA filtering. We integrate this into an unscented Kalman filtering (UKF) pipeline, which provides reliable convergence under nonlinearity and measurement noise. Extensive Monte Carlo analyses, Gazebo-based physics simulations, and field trials demonstrate that the proposed framework can reliably estimate the 3D position and velocity of an adversarial acoustic attack source in real time. It achieves sub-meter localization accuracy and over 90% success rates, with convergence times nearly halved compared to baseline methods. Overall, this study establishes a geometry-aware, real-time approach for acoustic threat localization, advancing autonomous surveillance capabilities of underwater infrastructures.

Title: Design Optimization and Global Impact Assessment of Solar-Thermal Direct Air Carbon Capture
Authors: Zhiyuan Fan, Bolun Xu
Abstract: The dual challenge of decarbonizing the economy and meeting rising global energy demand underscores the need for scalable and cost-effective carbon dioxide removal technologies. Direct air capture (DAC) is among the most promising approaches, but its high energy intensity, particularly the thermal energy required for sorbent regeneration, remains a critical barrier to cost reduction and sustainable deployment. This study explores solar-thermal DAC systems that combine concentrated solar thermal technology with low-cost sand-based thermal energy storage to meet this demand. We analyze the techno-economic performance of such systems in both grid-connected and stand-alone configurations. Results show that solar-thermal DAC can achieve annual capacity factors exceeding 80% and CO2 removal costs as low as 160-200 USD per ton, making it competitive with leading DAC technologies. The proposed system operates most efficiently with short-cycle sorbents that align with solar availability. The stand-alone Solar-DAC systems, which rely solely on solar energy for both electricity and thermal energy, are particularly promising in regions with high solar capacity and sandy terrain, exhibiting minimal ambient sensitivity from temperature and humidity. An optimal 6000 ton/yr modular system design takes <1 km2 land-use requirement and potentially >26 Gt/year DAC capacity is identified for sandy terrain alone globally. In areas with sedimentary basins suitable for CO2 storage, solar-powered DAC offers a lower-cost alternative to geothermal heating, which often faces geological and economic constraints.

Title: Sensing Security in Near-Field ISAC: Exploiting Scatterers for Eavesdropper Deception
Authors: Jiangong Chen, Xia Lei, Kaitao Meng, Kawon Han, Yuchen Zhang, Christos Masouros, Athina P. Petropulu
Abstract: In this paper, we explore sensing security in near-field (NF) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) scenarios by exploiting known scatterers in the sensing scene. We propose a location deception (LD) scheme where scatterers are deliberately illuminated with probing power that is higher than that directed toward targets of interest, with the goal of deceiving potential eavesdroppers (Eves) with sensing capability into misidentifying scatterers as targets. While the known scatterers can be removed at the legitimate sensing receiver, our LD approach causes Eves to misdetect targets. Notably, this deception is achieved without requiring any prior information about the Eves' characteristics or locations. To strike a flexible three-way tradeoff among communication, sensing, and sensing-security performance, the sum rate and power allocated to scatterers are weighted and maximized under a legitimate radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint. We employ the fractional programming (FP) framework and semidefinite relaxation (SDR) to solve this problem. To evaluate the security of the proposed LD scheme, the Cramer-Rao Bound (CRB) and mean squared error (MSE) metrics are employed. Additionally, we introduce the Kullback-Leibler Divergence (KLD) gap between targets and scatterers at Eve to quantify the impact of the proposed LD framework on Eve's sensing performance from an information-theoretical perspective. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed LD scheme can flexibly adjust the beamforming strategy according to performance requirements, thereby achieving the desired three-way tradeoff. In particular, in terms of sensing security, the proposed scheme significantly enhances the clutter signal strength at Eve's side, leading to confusion or even missed detection of the actual target.

Title: Deep Learning Based Joint Space-Time-Frequency Domain Channel Prediction for Cell-Free Massive MIMO Systems
Authors: Yongning Qi, Tao Zhou, Zuowei Xiang, Liu Liu, Bo Ai
Abstract: The cell-free massive multi-input multi-output (CF-mMIMO) is a promising technology for the six generation (6G) communication systems. Channel prediction will play an important role in obtaining the accurate CSI to improve the performance of CF-mMIMO systems. This paper studies a deep learning (DL) based joint space-time-frequency domain channel prediction for CF-mMIMO. Firstly, the prediction problems are formulated, which can output the multi-step prediction results in parallel without error propagation. Then, a novel channel prediction model is proposed, which adds frequency convolution (FreqConv) and space convolution (SpaceConv) layers to Transformer-encoder. It is able to utilize the space-time-frequency correlations and extract the space correlation in the irregular AP deployment. Next, simulated datasets with different sizes of service areas, UE velocities and scenarios are generated, and correlation analysis and cross-validation are used to determine the optimal hyper-parameters. According to the optimized hyper-parameters, the prediction accuracy and computational complexity are evaluated based on simulated datasets. It is indicated that the prediction accuracy of the proposed model is higher than traditional model, and its computational complexity is lower than traditional Transformer model. After that, the impacts of space-time-frequency correlations on prediction accuracy are studied. Finally, realistic datasets in a high-speed train (HST) long-term evolution (LTE) network are collected to verify the prediction accuracy. The verification results demonstrate that it also achieves higher prediction accuracy compared with traditional models in the HST LTE network.

Title: Soft Switching Expert Policies for Controlling Systems with Uncertain Parameters
Authors: Junya Ikemoto
Abstract: This paper proposes a simulation-based reinforcement learning algorithm for controlling systems with uncertain and varying system parameters. While simulators are useful for safely learning control policies for physical systems, mitigating the reality gap remains a major challenge. To address the challenge, we propose a two-stage algorithm. In the first stage, multiple control policies are learned for systems with different parameters in a simulator. In the second stage, for a real system, the control policies learned in the first stage are smoothly switched using an online convex optimization algorithm based on observations. Our proposed algorithm is demonstrated through numerical experiments.

Title: From Bundles to Backstepping: Geometric Control Barrier Functions for Safety-Critical Control on Manifolds
Authors: Massimiliano de Sa, Pio Ong, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Control barrier functions (CBFs) have a well-established theory in Euclidean spaces, yet still lack general formulations and constructive synthesis tools for systems evolving on manifolds common in robotics and aerospace applications. In this paper, we develop a general theory of geometric CBFs on bundles and, for control-affine systems, recover the standard optimization-based CBF controllers and their smooth analogues. Then, by generalizing kinetic energy-based CBF backstepping to Riemannian manifolds, we provide a constructive CBF synthesis technique for geometric mechanical systems, as well as easily verifiable conditions under which it succeeds. Further, this technique utilizes mechanical structure to avoid computations on higher-order tangent bundles. We demonstrate its application to an underactuated satellite on SO(3).

Title: NOMA for Visible Light Communications: Recent Advances and Future Directions
Authors: Xuesong Wang
Abstract: Rapidly increasing demand for high speed data is pushing 6G wireless networks to support larger link scales, lower latency, and higher spectral efficiency. Visible light communications (VLC) is a strong complement to radio frequency (RF) systems within 6G. The latest ITU G.9991 and IEEE 802.11bb standards are adapted from cable and RF wireless technologies for use in VLC, so they do not fully exploit the optical nature of light links. VLC links are often asymmetric between uplink and downlink, which makes TDMA style protocols inefficient when many users generate bursty and asymmetric traffic. Compared with RF, the strong directionality and frequent line of sight in VLC can mitigate hidden and exposed terminals, yet these effects can still appear under limited field of view, blockage, or reflections. CSMA/CA and related methods remain usable in VLC and in RF plus VLC networks, but they usually need design tweaks such as RTS/CTS or directional sensing to perform well. Although the optical spectrum is vast, the bandwidth of practical LEDs and of common PIN or APD receivers is limited, so efficient multiple access can yield large gains. This motivates a clean slate design for VLC, especially at the MAC layer. NOMA, first explored in 5G RF systems, is also promising for 6G VLC. It lets multiple users share the same time and frequency resources while tolerating controlled interference. This paper reviews progress in VLC and in NOMA based VLC, outlines key optimization constraints and objectives, surveys scenarios that fit NOMA in VLC, and points to several directions for future work.

Title: Neural Directional Filtering with Configurable Directivity Pattern at Inference
Authors: Weilong Huang, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Emanuël A. P. Habets
Abstract: Spatial filtering with a desired directivity pattern is advantageous for many audio applications. In this work, we propose neural directional filtering with user-defined directivity patterns (UNDF), which enables spatial filtering based on directivity patterns that users can define during inference. To achieve this, we propose a DNN architecture that integrates feature-wise linear modulation (FiLM), allowing user-defined patterns to serve as conditioning inputs. Through analysis, we demonstrate that the FiLM-based architecture enables the UNDF to generalize to unseen user-defined patterns during interference with higher directivities, scaling variations, and different steering directions. Furthermore, we progressively refine training strategies to enhance pattern approximation and enable UNDF to approximate irregular shapes. Lastly, experimental comparisons show that UNDF outperforms conventional methods.

Title: A Survey of OTFS-Based Index Modulation Techniques: Challenges, Benefits, and Future Directions for 6G and Beyond
Authors: Burak Ahmet Ozden, Erdogan Aydin, Emir Aslandogan, Haci Ilhan, Ertugrul Basar, Miaowen Wen, Marco Di Renzo, Vincent Poor
Abstract: Orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) is a two-dimensional modulation technique that uses the delay-Doppler (DD) domain and is a candidate for providing robust, high-capacity wireless communications for envisioned 6G and beyond networks. The OTFS technique maps data to the DD domain instead of the traditional time-frequency domain, enabling it to fully utilize channel diversity and transform fast time-varying channels into nearly static channels. Index modulation (IM) is a communication paradigm that conveys information not only through conventional modulation symbols but also by encoding data bits in the indices of the selected communication resources to improve error performance, spectral efficiency, and energy efficiency. In this survey, a comprehensive review of work on OTFS-based wireless communication systems is presented. In particular, the existing OTFS-IM schemes are reviewed and systematically categorized according to their system architectures, detection methods, and performance aspects such as capacity, peak-to-average power ratio, diversity, complexity, imperfect channel state information, spectral efficiency, and outage probability. Furthermore, the operating principles and system models of OTFS-IM variants-including OTFS-based space shift keying, OTFS-based spatial modulation, OTFS-based quadrature spatial modulation, OTFS-based media-based modulation, and OTFS-based code index modulation-are described, followed by a comparative performance analysis in terms of computational complexity, error performance, capacity, energy saving, spectral efficiency, and throughput. Finally, the challenges, benefits, and future directions for OTFS-IM systems are discussed, covering key aspects such as complexity, efficiency, latency, channel estimation, hardware constraints, synchronization, security, and potential integration with other advanced wireless communication techniques.

Title: GUSL-Dehaze: A Green U-Shaped Learning Approach to Image Dehazing
Authors: Mahtab Movaheddrad, Laurence Palmer, C.-C. Jay Kuo
Abstract: Image dehazing is a restoration task that aims to recover a clear image from a single hazy input. Traditional approaches rely on statistical priors and the physics-based atmospheric scattering model to reconstruct the haze-free image. While recent state-of-the-art methods are predominantly based on deep learning architectures, these models often involve high computational costs and large parameter sizes, making them unsuitable for resource-constrained devices. In this work, we propose GUSL-Dehaze, a Green U-Shaped Learning approach to image dehazing. Our method integrates a physics-based model with a green learning (GL) framework, offering a lightweight, transparent alternative to conventional deep learning techniques. Unlike neural network-based solutions, GUSL-Dehaze completely avoids deep learning. Instead, we begin with an initial dehazing step using a modified Dark Channel Prior (DCP), which is followed by a green learning pipeline implemented through a U-shaped architecture. This architecture employs unsupervised representation learning for effective feature extraction, together with feature-engineering techniques such as the Relevant Feature Test (RFT) and the Least-Squares Normal Transform (LNT) to maintain a compact model size. Finally, the dehazed image is obtained via a transparent supervised learning strategy. GUSL-Dehaze significantly reduces parameter count while ensuring mathematical interpretability and achieving performance on par with state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Title: Near-Field 3D Localization and MIMO Channel Estimation with Sub-Connected Planar Arrays
Authors: Kangda Zhi, Tianyu Yang, Songyan Xue, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of channel estimation and 3D localization algorithms in a challenging scenario, where a sub-connected planar extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) communicates with multi-antenna users. In the near field, the uplink MIMO channel is of full column rank and therefore can not be estimated effectively by applying existing codebooks that are designed for the far-field case or for the near-field case but limited to single antenna users. To solve this problem, we propose a three-stage algorithm aided by orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP) and sparse Bayesian learning (SBL). Specifically, we firstly partition the XL-MIMO into subarrays and use OMP to solve the compressed sensing (CS) problem about subarray channel estimation with the Discrete Fourier Transform (DFT)-based dictionary matrix. Secondly, exploiting the estimated subarray channels and employing one-dimensional multiple signal classification (MUSIC), we estimate the central location of the user array under the Least Squares (LS) criterion. Finally, we utilize the estimated central location to construct a refined location-aided dictionary matrix and obtain the MIMO channel estimation using SBL. Results exhibit the significant superiority of the proposed algorithm compared with several benchmarks, in terms of both the pilot overhead and estimation accuracy.

Title: Multi-layer Optimized Coordination of Smart Building Resources in Active Power Distribution Systems
Authors: Mohammadali Rostami, Saeed Lotfifard, Mladen Kezunovic
Abstract: This paper proposes a multi-actor coordination platform for the optimal utilization of smart buildings resources, including roof top PV generation and battery energy storage system (BESS), in active power distribution systems. The proposed multi-actor coordination includes the Smart Building Coordinator (SBC), Micro-Grid Coordinator (MGC) and Distribution System Coordinator (DSC). The coordinators operate independently and only exchange limited information with each other to reach an optimal solution. In the proposed platform, a hierarchical optimization problem is solved to optimally determine the operating point of all distribution system resources. The proposed platform fully preserves the confidentiality of the behind the meter (BTM) data of the buildings since no information about the status of the PV system, BESS, and load of the building is shared with the owner of the power system. The proposed platform has a flexible and scalable architecture where the computational task of coordinating microgrids and smart buildings with distribution grid is performed locally at the MGC and SBC layers, respectively. Numerical simulations show the efficacy of the proposed platform in coordinating the BTM resources with the rest of the distribution system.

Title: Channel Estimation and Passive Beamforming for Pixel-based Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces with Non-Separable State Response
Authors: Huayan Guo, Junhui Rao, Alex M. H. Wong, Ross Murch, Vincent K. N. Lau
Abstract: Pixel-based reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) employ a novel design to achieve high reflection gain at a lower hardware cost by eliminating the phase shifters used in traditional RIS. However, this design presents challenges for channel estimation and passive beamforming due to its non-separable state response, rendering existing solutions ineffective. To address this, we first approximate the non-separable RIS response functions using a kernel-based method and a deep neural network, achieving high accuracy while reducing computational and memory complexity. Next, we propose a simplified cascaded channel model that focuses on dominated scattering paths with limited unknown parameters, along with customized algorithms to estimate short-term and long-term parameters separately. Finally, we introduce a low-complexity passive beamforming algorithm to configure the discrete RIS state vector, maximizing the achievable rate. Our simulation results demonstrate that the proposed solution significantly outperforms various baselines across a wide SNR range.

Title: A Transformer Inspired AI-based MIMO receiver
Authors: András Rácz, Tamás Borsos, András Veres, Benedek Csala
Abstract: We present AttDet, a Transformer-inspired MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) detection method that treats each transmit layer as a token and learns inter-stream interference via a lightweight self-attention mechanism. Queries and keys are derived directly from the estimated channel matrix, so attention scores quantify channel correlation. Values are initialized by matched-filter outputs and iteratively refined. The AttDet design combines model-based interpretability with data-driven flexibility. We demonstrate through link-level simulations under realistic 5G channel models and high-order, mixed QAM modulation and coding schemes, that AttDet can approach near-optimal BER/BLER (Bit Error Rate/Block Error Rate) performance while maintaining predictable, polynomial complexity.

Title: Efficient Medium Access Control for Low-Latency Industrial M2M Communications
Authors: Anwar Ahmed Khan, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Efficient medium access control (MAC) is critical for enabling low-latency and reliable communication in industrial Machine-to-Machine (M2M) net-works, where timely data delivery is essential for seamless operation. The presence of multi-priority data in high-risk industrial environments further adds to the challenges. The development of tens of MAC schemes over the past decade often makes it a tough choice to deploy the most efficient solu-tion. Therefore, a comprehensive cross-comparison of major MAC protocols across a range of performance parameters appears necessary to gain deeper insights into their relative strengths and limitations. This paper presents a comparison of Contention window-based MAC scheme BoP-MAC with a fragmentation based, FROG-MAC; both protocols focus on reducing the delay for higher priority traffic, while taking a diverse approach. BoP-MAC assigns a differentiated back-off value to the multi-priority traffic, whereas FROG-MAC enables early transmission of higher-priority packets by fragmenting lower-priority traffic. Simulations were performed on Contiki by varying the number of nodes for two traffic priorities. It has been shown that when work-ing with multi-priority heterogenous data in the industrial environment, FROG-MAC results better both in terms of delay and throughput.

Title: Interlacing in Controllers Implementation: Frequency Analysis
Authors: Julian Salt
Abstract: The main goal of this contribution is to explain how to use interlacing techniques for LTI controllers implementation and analyze different struc- tures in this environment. These considerations lead to an important com- putation saving in constrained resource environments. It has been also intro- duced new procedures for obtaining the blocks related to different real and complex controllers poles. The resultant time-varying system is modeled using proper discrete lifting techniques and a new and efficient dual-rate fre- quency response computation allows to determine the characteristics of the control loop with interlaced controller. Examples illustrate the theoretical proposals.

Title: A Multifunctional Capacitive Sensing Platform for Wireless Vascular and Heart Monitoring
Authors: Parviz Zolfaghari, Beril Yagmur Koca, Taher Abbasiasl, Hakan Urey, Hadi Mirzajani
Abstract: We present a multifunctional, antenna-integrated capacitive sensing (MAiCaS) platform for passive, wireless, and real-time cardiovascular monitoring. Unlike conventional systems that require separate sensors and wireless modules, our device unifies sensing, telemetry, and mechanical functionality into a compact and scalable design by exploiting the parasitic capacitance of an inductive antenna as a strain-sensitive element. The sensor is fabricated using a cleanroom-free, single-step UV laser patterning process on a flexible PDMS substrate, reducing manufacturing complexity and enabling high reproducibility. The MAiCaS is suitable for three different applications: as a sensor for epicardial strain measurement, a stent as a sensor, and a vascular graft sensor. We demonstrate MAiCaS's versatility by validating its wireless resonance-based response to strain, pressure, and deformation across unrolled and rolled forms. In vitro experiments demonstrated consistent resonance frequency shifts under physiological conditions, with stable performance on skin, in PBS, human serum, and simulated vascular environments. Repeatability and aging tests confirmed its long-term reliability and elasticity under cyclic loading. Calibration curves revealed high sensitivity across all configurations, with wireless interrogation achieved through S11 parameter measurements and resonance frequency shift as the output metric. The sensitivity of the device was measured to be 2.9 MHz per 1% strain, 0.43 MHz/mmHg, and 309.6kHz/\textmu m for epicardial patch, graft, and stent integrated sensor, respectively. The operation of MAiCaS was evaluated in a human experiment. This monolithic sensor architecture provides a scalable and cost-effective solution for battery-free monitoring of vascular dynamics, with potential for remote diagnostics, post-surgical follow-up, and continuous cardiovascular health management.

Title: Inference-Optimal ISAC via Task-Oriented Feature Transmission and Power Allocation
Authors: Biao Dong, Bin Cao, Qinyu Zhang
Abstract: This work is concerned with the coordination gain in integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems under a compress-and-estimate (CE) framework, wherein inference performance is leveraged as the key metric. To enable tractable transceiver design and resource optimization, we characterize inference performance via an error probability bound as a monotonic function of the discriminant gain (DG). This raises the natural question of whether maximizing DG, rather than minimizing mean squared error (MSE), can yield better inference performance. Closed-form solutions for DG-optimal and MSE-optimal transceiver designs are derived, revealing water-filling-type structures and explicit sensing and communication (S\&C) tradeoff. Numerical experiments confirm that DG-optimal design achieves more power-efficient transmission, especially in the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by selectively allocating power to informative features and thus saving transmit power for sensing.

Title: Behavior-Aware Online Prediction of Obstacle Occupancy using Zonotopes
Authors: Alvaro Carrizosa-Rendon, Jian Zhou, Erik Frisk, Vicenc Puig, Fatiha Nejjari
Abstract: Predicting the motion of surrounding vehicles is key to safe autonomous driving, especially in unstructured environments without prior information. This paper proposes a novel online method to accurately predict the occupancy sets of surrounding vehicles based solely on motion observations. The approach is divided into two stages: first, an Extended Kalman Filter and a Linear Programming (LP) problem are used to estimate a compact zonotopic set of control actions; then, a reachability analysis propagates this set to predict future occupancy. The effectiveness of the method has been validated through simulations in an urban environment, showing accurate and compact predictions without relying on prior assumptions or prior training data.

Title: Joint Computation Offloading and Resource Management for Cooperative Satellite-Aerial-Marine Internet of Things Networks
Authors: Shuang Qi, Bin Lin, Yiqin Deng, Hongyang Pan, Xu Hu
Abstract: Devices within the marine Internet of Things (MIoT) can connect to low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) to facilitate low-latency data transmission and execution, as well as enhanced-capacity data storage. However, without proper traffic handling strategy, it is still difficult to effectively meet the low-latency requirements. In this paper, we consider a cooperative satellite-aerial-MIoT network (CSAMN) for maritime edge computing and maritime data storage to prioritize delay-sensitive (DS) tasks by employing mobile edge computing, while handling delay-tolerant (DT) tasks via the store-carry-forward method. Considering the delay constraints of DS tasks, we formulate a constrained joint optimization problem of maximizing satellite-collected data volume while minimizing system energy consumption by controlling four interdependent variables, including the transmit power of UAVs for DS tasks, the start time of DT tasks, computing resource allocation, and offloading ratio. To solve this non-convex and non-linear problem, we propose a joint computation offloading and resource management (JCORM) algorithm using the Dinkelbach method and linear programming. Our results show that the volume of data collected by the proposed JCORM algorithm can be increased by up to 41.5% compared to baselines. Moreover, JCORM algorithm achieves a dramatic reduction in computational time, from a maximum of 318.21 seconds down to just 0.16 seconds per experiment, making it highly suitable for real-time maritime applications.

Title: Analysis of Frequency-Diverse and Dispersion Effects in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna for Holographic Sensing and Imaging
Authors: Abdul Jabbar, Aakash Bansal, William Whittow
Abstract: Dynamic metasurface antennas (DMAs) represent a novel approach to programmable and affordable electromagnetic wave manipulation for enhanced wireless communications, sensing, and imaging applications. Nevertheless, current DMA designs and models are usually quasi-narrowband, neglecting the versatile frequency-diverse manifestation and its utilization. This work demonstrates the frequency-diversity and dispersion operations of a representative DMA structure at the millimeter-wave band. We demonstrate flexible dispersion manipulation through dynamic holographic reconfigurability of the meta-atoms in a DMA. This effect can create distinct radiation patterns across the operating frequency band, achieving flexible frequency diversity with enhanced scanning range within a compact, reconfigurable platform. It eliminates the need for wideband systems or complex phase-shifting networks while offering an alternative to frequency-scanned static beams of traditional leaky-wave antennas. The results establish fundamental insights into modelling and utilization of dispersive effects of DMAs in next-generation near-field and far-field holographic sensing and computational holographic imaging applications.

Title: An Accelerated Mixed Weighted-Unweighted MMSE Approach for MU-MIMO Beamforming
Authors: Xi Gao, Akang Wang, Junkai Zhang, Qihong Duan, Jiang Xue
Abstract: Precoding design based on weighted sum-rate (WSR) maximization is a fundamental problem in downlink multi-user multiple-input multiple-output (MU-MIMO) systems. While the weighted minimum mean-square error (WMMSE) algorithm is a standard solution, its high computational complexity--cubic in the number of base station antennas due to matrix inversions--hinders its application in latency-sensitive scenarios. To address this limitation, we propose a highly parallel algorithm based on a block coordinate descent framework. Our key innovation lies in updating the precoding matrix via block coordinate gradient descent, which avoids matrix inversions and relies solely on matrix multiplications, making it exceptionally amenable to GPU acceleration. We prove that the proposed algorithm converges to a stationary point of the WSR maximization problem. Furthermore, we introduce a two-stage warm-start strategy grounded in the sum mean-square error (MSE) minimization problem to accelerate convergence. We refer to our method as the Accelerated Mixed weighted-unweighted sum-MSE minimization (A-MMMSE) algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that A-MMMSE matches the WSR performance of both conventional WMMSE and its enhanced variant, reduced-WMMSE, while achieving a substantial reduction in computational time across diverse system configurations.

Title: Performance Analysis of End-to-End LEO Satellite-Aided Shore-to-Ship Communications: A Stochastic Geometry Approach
Authors: Xu Hu, Bin Lin, Xiao Lu, Ping Wang, Nan Cheng, Zhisheng Yin, Weihua Zhuang
Abstract: Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite networks have shown strategic superiority in maritime communications, assisting in establishing signal transmissions from shore to ship through space-based links. Traditional performance modeling based on multiple circular orbits is challenging to characterize large-scale LEO satellite constellations, thus requiring a tractable approach to accurately evaluate the network performance. In this paper, we propose a theoretical framework for an LEO satellite-aided shore-to-ship communication network (LEO-SSCN), where LEO satellites are distributed as a binomial point process (BPP) on a specific spherical surface. The framework aims to obtain the end-to-end transmission performance by considering signal transmissions through either a marine link or a space link subject to Rician or Shadowed Rician fading, respectively. Due to the indeterminate position of the serving satellite, accurately modeling the distance from the serving satellite to the destination ship becomes intractable. To address this issue, we propose a distance approximation approach. Then, by approximation and incorporating a threshold-based communication scheme, we leverage stochastic geometry to derive analytical expressions of end-to-end transmission success probability and average transmission rate capacity. Extensive numerical results verify the accuracy of the analysis and demonstrate the effect of key parameters on the performance of LEO-SSCN.

Title: Decentralized Small Gain and Phase Stability Conditions for Grid-Forming Converters: Limitations and Extensions
Authors: Diego Cifelli, Adolfo Anta
Abstract: The increasing share of converter based resources in power systems calls for scalable methods to analyse stability without relying on exhaustive system wide simulations. Decentralized small gain and small-phase criteria have recently been proposed for this purpose, but their applicability to grid forming converters is severely limited by the sectoriality assumption, which is not typically satisfied at low frequencies. This work revisits and extends mixed gain phase conditions by introducing loop shaping transformations that reformulate converter and network models in alternative coordinate frames. The proposed approach resolves intrinsic non sectoriality at low frequencies and reduces conservativeness, thereby improving the applicability of decentralized stability certification. Analytical results are illustrated using an infinite bus system first and then extended to the IEEE 14 bus network, demonstrating the practicality and scalability of the method. These findings provide a pathway toward less conservative and more widely applicable decentralized stability certificates in power grids.

Title: Time-series Random Process Complexity Ranking Using a Bound on Conditional Differential Entropy
Authors: Jacob Ayers, Richard Hahnloser, Julia Ulrich, Lothar Sebastian Krapp, Remo Nitschke, Sabine Stoll, Balthasar Bickel, Reinhard Furrer
Abstract: Conditional differential entropy provides an intuitive measure for relatively ranking time-series complexity by quantifying uncertainty in future observations given past context. However, its direct computation for high-dimensional processes from unknown distributions is often intractable. This paper builds on the information theoretic prediction error bounds established by Fang et al. \cite{fang2019generic}, which demonstrate that the conditional differential entropy \textbf{$h(X_k \mid X_{k-1},...,X_{k-m})$} is upper bounded by a function of the determinant of the covariance matrix of next-step prediction errors for any next step prediction model. We add to this theoretical framework by further increasing this bound by leveraging Hadamard's inequality and the positive semi-definite property of covariance matrices. To see if these bounds can be used to rank the complexity of time series, we conducted two synthetic experiments: (1) controlled linear autoregressive processes with additive Gaussian noise, where we compare ordinary least squares prediction error entropy proxies to the true entropies of various additive noises, and (2) a complexity ranking task of bio-inspired synthetic audio data with unknown entropy, where neural network prediction errors are used to recover the known complexity ordering. This framework provides a computationally tractable method for time-series complexity ranking using prediction errors from next-step prediction models, that maintains a theoretical foundation in information theory.

Title: Safe Decentralized Density Control of Multi-Robot Systems using PDE-Constrained Optimization with State Constraints
Authors: Longchen Niu, Gennaro Notomista
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a decentralized optimization-based density controller designed to enforce set invariance constraints in multi-robot systems. By designing a decentralized control barrier function, we derived sufficient conditions under which local safety constraints guarantee global safety. We account for localization and motion noise explicitly by modeling robots as spatial probability density functions governed by the Fokker-Planck equation. Compared to traditional centralized approaches, our controller requires less computational and communication power, making it more suitable for deployment in situations where perfect communication and localization are impractical. The controller is validated through simulations and experiments with four quadcopters.

Title: Sugar Shack 4.0: Implementation of a Cyber-Physical System for Logistic and Sanitary Automation in a Maple Syrup Boiling Center
Authors: Thomas Bernard, François Grondin, Jean-Michel Lavoie
Abstract: This paper presents the design and deployment of a process-aware cyber-physical system that automates plant-level logistics, traceability, and sanitation in a centralized maple-syrup boiling center. The system replaces ad-hoc, manual operations with event-driven orchestration on a local server, employing reusable device abstractions and a centralized interlock with priority-based arbitration for shared piping. It implements deterministic routines for delivery, reverse osmosis integration, evaporator feed, and permeate management. The system is sensor rich: inline measurements of flow, temperature, and sugar concentration (degrees Brix) drive routing decisions and trigger systematic post-transfer rinses (cleaning-in-place), ensuring consistent hygiene and complete, immediate traceability up to the evaporator inlet. During the 2025 production season, the system queued 431 operations without incident; executed 908 \enquote{topstock} and \enquote{downstock} balancing cycles; increased usable permeate reserves from 22,712 to approximately 41,640 L through dynamic storage assignment; eliminated mid-season contamination incidents previously observed under manual practice; and reduced administrative effort for billing and reporting from more than 30 hours to roughly 1 hour through automatic documentation. These results demonstrate a practical path to modular, plant-scale automation beyond traditional architectures, and lay the groundwork for packaging reusable elements for similar plants or adjacent industries. This work is part of a larger project involving the first scientifically-documented integration of Industry 4.0 technologies in a maple syrup boiling center.

Title: Learning Optimal Power Flow with Pointwise Constraints
Authors: Damian Owerko, Anna Scaglione, Alejandro Ribeiro
Abstract: Training learning parameterizations to solve optimal power flow (OPF) with pointwise constraints is proposed. In this novel training approach, a learning parameterization is substituted directly into an OPF problem with constraints required to hold over all problem instances. This is different from existing supervised learning methods in which constraints are required to hold across the average of problem instances. Training with pointwise constraints is undertaken in the dual domain with the use of augmented Lagrangian and dual gradient ascent algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrate that training with pointwise constraints produces solutions with smaller constraint violations. Experiments further demonstrated that pointwise constraints are most effective at reducing constraint violations in corner cases - defined as those realizations in which constraints are most difficult to satisfy. Gains are most pronounced in power systems with large numbers of buses.

Title: Bilevel Analysis of Cost and Emissions Externalities from Data Center Load Shifting
Authors: Aron Brenner, Rahman Khorramfar, Nathan Engelman Lado, Line Roald, Saurabh Amin
Abstract: Data centers are emerging as large, flexible electricity consumers capable of shifting computational workloads across locations in response to economic and environmental signals. While this flexibility has potential for emissions reduction, its impact on power system operations depends critically on how such behavior interacts with network constraints and market signals. We develop a bilevel optimization framework in which a data center minimizes a weighted combination of electricity cost and marginal emissions intensity (LME), while the system operator clears economic dispatch under transmission and generation constraints. Focusing on a stylized three-bus power system, we derive closed-form, piecewise-linear expressions for both the data center and system-wide objectives as functions of the data centers' load shift. These expressions capture threshold-driven regime changes due to congestion and renewable saturation. We identify sufficient conditions under which the data center's decentralized decisions align with or diverge from socially optimal behavior and characterize the resulting externalities. Our results reveal how system topology and generator asymmetry affect incentive alignment and provide insight into when marginal price or emissions signals may fail to guide flexible loads toward socially beneficial outcomes. Our results offer a tractable starting point for analyzing decentralized flexibility under carbon-aware incentives and suggest directions for improving coordination between flexible loads and system operations.

Title: Benchmarking Reasoning Reliability in Artificial Intelligence Models for Energy-System Analysis
Authors: Eliseo Curcio
Abstract: Artificial intelligence and machine learning are increasingly used for forecasting, optimization, and policy design in the energy sector, yet no standardized framework exists to evaluate whether these systems reason correctly. Current validation practices focus on predictive accuracy or computational efficiency, leaving the logical integrity of analytical conclusions untested. This study introduces the Analytical Reliability Benchmark (ARB), a reproducible framework that quantifies reasoning reliability in large language models applied to energy system analysis. The benchmark integrates five submetrics: accuracy, reasoning reliability, uncertainty discipline, policy consistency, and transparency, and evaluates model performance across deterministic, probabilistic, and epistemic scenarios using open technoeconomic datasets (NREL ATB 2024, DOE H2A/H2New, IEA WEO 2024). Four frontier models (GPT-4/5, Claude 4.5 Sonnet, Gemini 2.5 Pro, Llama 3 70B) were tested under identical factual and regulatory conditions. Results show that reasoning reliability can be objectively measured. GPT-4/5 and Claude 4.5 Sonnet achieved consistent and policy-compliant reasoning (Analytical Reliability Index greater than 90), Gemini 2.5 Pro demonstrated moderate stability, and Llama 3 70B remained below professional thresholds. Statistical validation confirmed that these differences are significant and reproducible. The ARB establishes the first quantitative method in the energy literature for verifying causal, probabilistic, and policy-driven reasoning in artificial intelligence systems, providing a reference framework for trustworthy and transparent analytical applications in the global energy transition.

Title: Ultra-Fast Wireless Power Hacking
Authors: Hui Wang, Hans D. Schotten, Stefan M. Goetz
Abstract: The rapid growth of electric vehicles (EVs) has driven the development of roadway wireless charging technology, effectively extending EV driving range. However, wireless charging introduces significant cybersecurity challenges. Any receiver within the magnetic field can potentially extract energy, and previous research demonstrated that a hacker could detect the operating frequency and steal substantial power. However, our approach required time to track new frequencies or precise adjustments of inductance and capacitance, which would be less effective against potential rapid transmitter frequency changes or capacitance drift. As a solution, we enhanced the interceptor and enabled it to intrude as well as steal energy within just three cycles of the high-frequency signal. Moreover, it can work without any circuit parameters or look-up tables. The key innovation is synchronizing the receiver current with the phase of the magnetic sensor voltage. Through MATLAB / Simulink simulations, finite-element analysis, and experimental validation, we demonstrated that our improved method can steal over 76% of the power received by a fully resonant receiver under identical conditions. This attack demonstrates that simple frequency-changing power encryption offers limited protection against such threats.

Title: Modeling to Generate Alternatives for Robustness of Mixed Integer DC Optimal Power Flow
Authors: Constance Crozier
Abstract: Transmission system operators face a variety of discrete operational decisions, such as switching of branches and/or devices. Incorporating these decisions into optimal power flow (OPF) results in mixed-integer non-linear programming problems (MINLPs), which can't presently be solved at scale in the required time. Various linearizations of the OPF exist, most famously the DC-OPF, which can be leveraged to find integer decisions. However, these linearizations can yield very poor integer solutions in some edge cases, making them challenging to incorporate into control rooms. This paper introduces the use of modeling to generate alternatives (MGA) to find alternative solutions to the linearized problems, reducing the chance of finding no AC feasible solutions. We test this approach using 13 networks where the DC linearization results in infeasible integer decisions, and MGA finds a solution in all cases. The MGA search criteria selected drastically affects the number and quality of solutions found, so network specific search functions may be necessary.

Title: Balancing Specialization and Centralization: A Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning Benchmark for Sequential Industrial Control
Authors: Tom Maus, Asma Atamna, Tobias Glasmachers
Abstract: Autonomous control of multi-stage industrial processes requires both local specialization and global coordination. Reinforcement learning (RL) offers a promising approach, but its industrial adoption remains limited due to challenges such as reward design, modularity, and action space management. Many academic benchmarks differ markedly from industrial control problems, limiting their transferability to real-world applications. This study introduces an enhanced industry-inspired benchmark environment that combines tasks from two existing benchmarks, SortingEnv and ContainerGym, into a sequential recycling scenario with sorting and pressing operations. We evaluate two control strategies: a modular architecture with specialized agents and a monolithic agent governing the full system, while also analyzing the impact of action masking. Our experiments show that without action masking, agents struggle to learn effective policies, with the modular architecture performing better. When action masking is applied, both architectures improve substantially, and the performance gap narrows considerably. These results highlight the decisive role of action space constraints and suggest that the advantages of specialization diminish as action complexity is reduced. The proposed benchmark thus provides a valuable testbed for exploring practical and robust multi-agent RL solutions in industrial automation, while contributing to the ongoing debate on centralization versus specialization.

Title: Path-Based Conditions for the Identifiability of Non-additive Nonlinear Networks with Full Measurements
Authors: Renato Vizuete, Julien M. Hendrickx
Abstract: We analyze the identifiability of nonlinear networks with node dynamics characterized by functions that are non-additive. We consider the full measurement case (all the nodes are measured) in the path-independent delay scenario where all the excitation signals of a specific node have the same delay in the output of a measured node. Based on the notion of a generic nonlinear matrix associated with the network, we introduce the concept of generic identifiability and characterize the space of functions that satisfies this property. For directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) characterized by analytic functions, we derive a sufficient condition for identifiability based on vertex-disjoint paths from excited nodes to the in-neighbors of each node in the network. Furthermore, when we consider the class of polynomial functions, by using well-known results on algebraic varieties, we prove that the vertex-disjoint path condition is also necessary. Finally, we show that this identifiability condition is not necessary for the additive nonlinear model. Some examples are added to illustrate the results.

Title: Simultaneous Wireless Information and Power Transfer for Fluid Antenna Systems
Authors: Feilong Zhang, Jianxin Dai, Zhaohui Yang, Kai-Kit Wong, Lingyuxiu Li, Jianglin Ye
Abstract: Fluid antenna is a promising wireless communication technology that enhances communication rate by changing the antenna positions. This article proposes a new communication system that combines multiple-input single-output (MISO) fluid antennas with traditional fixed-position antennas, utilizing antenna position optimization to improve energy harvesting efficiency. In this model, we consider simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) which transmits identical signals from the base station to both information receiver (IR) and energy receiver (ER). We strive to enhance the power delivered to the ER by fine-tuning the positions of transmit and receive fluid antennas, along with optimizing the transmit covariance matrix, subject to a given minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) constraint at the IR. Simulation results indicate that fluid antenna systems significantly enhance the energy harvesting efficiency of the ER compared to traditional fixed-position antennas.

Title: Resounding Acoustic Fields with Reciprocity
Authors: Zitong Lan, Yiduo Hao, Mingmin Zhao
Abstract: Achieving immersive auditory experiences in virtual environments requires flexible sound modeling that supports dynamic source positions. In this paper, we introduce a task called resounding, which aims to estimate room impulse responses at arbitrary emitter location from a sparse set of measured emitter positions, analogous to the relighting problem in vision. We leverage the reciprocity property and introduce Versa, a physics-inspired approach to facilitating acoustic field learning. Our method creates physically valid samples with dense virtual emitter positions by exchanging emitter and listener poses. We also identify challenges in deploying reciprocity due to emitter/listener gain patterns and propose a self-supervised learning approach to address them. Results show that Versa substantially improve the performance of acoustic field learning on both simulated and real-world datasets across different metrics. Perceptual user studies show that Versa can greatly improve the immersive spatial sound experience. Code, dataset and demo videos are available on the project website: this https URL.

Title: Bayesian Jammer Localization with a Hybrid CNN and Path-Loss Mixture of Experts
Authors: Mariona Jaramillo-Civill, Luis González-Gudiño, Tales Imbiriba, Pau Closas
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) signals are vulnerable to jamming, particularly in urban areas where multipath and shadowing distort received power. Previous data-driven approaches achieved reasonable localization but poorly reconstructed the received signal strength (RSS) field due to limited spatial context. We propose a hybrid Bayesian mixture-of-experts framework that fuses a physical path-loss (PL) model and a convolutional neural network (CNN) through log-linear pooling. The PL expert ensures physical consistency, while the CNN leverages building-height maps to capture urban propagation effects. Bayesian inference with Laplace approximation provides posterior uncertainty over both the jammer position and RSS field. Experiments on urban ray-tracing data show that localization accuracy improves and uncertainty decreases with more training points, while uncertainty concentrates near the jammer and along urban canyons where propagation is most sensitive.

Title: R2-SVC: Towards Real-World Robust and Expressive Zero-shot Singing Voice Conversion
Authors: Junjie Zheng, Gongyu Chen, Chaofan Ding, Zihao Chen
Abstract: In real-world singing voice conversion (SVC) applications, environmental noise and the demand for expressive output pose significant challenges. Conventional methods, however, are typically designed without accounting for real deployment scenarios, as both training and inference usually rely on clean data. This mismatch hinders practical use, given the inevitable presence of diverse noise sources and artifacts from music separation. To tackle these issues, we propose R2-SVC, a robust and expressive SVC framework. First, we introduce simulation-based robustness enhancement through random fundamental frequency ($F_0$) perturbations and music separation artifact simulations (e.g., reverberation, echo), substantially improving performance under noisy conditions. Second, we enrich speaker representation using domain-specific singing data: alongside clean vocals, we incorporate DNSMOS-filtered separated vocals and public singing corpora, enabling the model to preserve speaker timbre while capturing singing style nuances. Third, we integrate the Neural Source-Filter (NSF) model to explicitly represent harmonic and noise components, enhancing the naturalness and controllability of converted singing. R2-SVC achieves state-of-the-art results on multiple SVC benchmarks under both clean and noisy conditions.

Abstract: In this paper, we consider the problem of spread pilot design and effective channel estimation in multiple-input multiple-output Zak-OTFS (MIMO-Zak-OTFS) with superimposed spread pilots, where data and spread pilot signals are superimposed in the same frame. To achieve good estimation performance in a MIMO setting, the spread pilots at different transmit antennas need to be effectively separated at the receiver. Towards this, we propose a spread pilot design that separates the pilot sequences in the cross-ambiguity domain and enables the estimation of the effective channel taps by a simple read-off operation. To further alleviate the effect of pilot-data interference on performance, we carry out turbo iterations between channel estimation and detection. Simulation results for $2\times 2$ and $3\times 3$ MIMO-Zak-OTFS with Gaussian-sinc pulse shaping filter for vehicular-A channel model show that the proposed pilot design and estimation scheme with three turbo iterations can achieve very good estimation/detection performance.

Title: Radar-Camera Fused Multi-Object Tracking: Online Calibration and Common Feature
Authors: Lei Cheng, Siyang Cao
Abstract: This paper presents a Multi-Object Tracking (MOT) framework that fuses radar and camera data to enhance tracking efficiency while minimizing manual interventions. Contrary to many studies that underutilize radar and assign it a supplementary role--despite its capability to provide accurate range/depth information of targets in a world 3D coordinate system--our approach positions radar in a crucial role. Meanwhile, this paper utilizes common features to enable online calibration to autonomously associate detections from radar and camera. The main contributions of this work include: (1) the development of a radar-camera fusion MOT framework that exploits online radar-camera calibration to simplify the integration of detection results from these two sensors, (2) the utilization of common features between radar and camera data to accurately derive real-world positions of detected objects, and (3) the adoption of feature matching and category-consistency checking to surpass the limitations of mere position matching in enhancing sensor association accuracy. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to investigate the integration of radar-camera common features and their use in online calibration for achieving MOT. The efficacy of our framework is demonstrated by its ability to streamline the radar-camera mapping process and improve tracking precision, as evidenced by real-world experiments conducted in both controlled environments and actual traffic scenarios.

Title: Constrained Trajectory Optimization for Hybrid Dynamical Systems
Authors: Pietro Noah Crestaz, Gokhan Alcan, Ville Kyrki
Abstract: Hybrid dynamical systems pose significant challenges for effective planning and control, especially when additional constraints such as obstacle avoidance, state boundaries, and actuation limits are present. In this letter, we extend the recently proposed Hybrid iLQR method [1] to handle state and input constraints within an indirect optimization framework, aiming to preserve computational efficiency and ensure dynamic feasibility. Specifically, we incorporate two constraint handling mechanisms into the Hybrid iLQR: Discrete Barrier State and Augmented Lagrangian methods. Comprehensive simulations across various operational situations are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these extended methods in terms of convergence and their ability to handle infeasible starting trajectories. Results indicate that while the Discrete Barrier State approach is more computationally efficient, the Augmented Lagrangian method outperforms it in complex and real-world scenarios with infeasible initial trajectories.

Title: Scalable Distributed Least Squares Algorithm for Linear Algebraic Equations via Periodic Scheduling
Authors: Shenyu Liu
Abstract: In this work, we propose a novel discrete-time distributed algorithm for finding least-squares solutions of linear algebraic equations with a scheduling protocol to further enhance its scalability. Each agent in the network is assumed to know some rows of the coefficient matrix and the corresponding entries in the observation vector. Unlike typical distributed algorithms, our approach considers communication bandwidth limits, allowing agents to transmit only a portion of their ``guessed" solution, independent of its dimension. A cyclic scheduling protocol determines which portion is transmitted at each iteration. Assuming a small fixed step size and a diagonalizable algorithm matrix, we prove that agents' ``guessed" solutions converge exponentially to a least squares solution. For cases where the observation vectors are time-varying, a modified algorithm guarantees practical convergence, with tracking error bounded by the single-step variation in the observation vector. Simulations and comparisons with state-of-the-art algorithms validate our algorithm's feasibility and scalability.

Title: Convergence in On-line Learning of Static and Dynamic Systems
Authors: Torbjörn Wigren, Ruoqi Zhang, Per Mattsson
Abstract: The paper derives analytical expressions for the asymptotic average updating direction of the adaptive moment generation (ADAM) algorithm when applied to recursive identification of nonlinear systems. It is proved that the standard hyper-parameter setting results in the same asymptotic average updating direction as a diagonally power normalized stochastic gradient algorithm. With the internal filtering turned off, the asymptotic average updating direction is instead equivalent to that of a sign-sign stochastic gradient algorithm. Global convergence to an invariant set follows, where a subset of parameters contain those that give a correct input-output description of the system. The paper also exploits a nonlinear dynamic model to embed structure in recurrent neural networks. A Monte-Carlo simulation study validates the results.

Title: Shallow Flow Matching for Coarse-to-Fine Text-to-Speech Synthesis
Authors: Dong Yang, Yiyi Cai, Yuki Saito, Lixu Wang, Hiroshi Saruwatari
Abstract: We propose Shallow Flow Matching (SFM), a novel mechanism that enhances flow matching (FM)-based text-to-speech (TTS) models within a coarse-to-fine generation paradigm. Unlike conventional FM modules, which use the coarse representations from the weak generator as conditions, SFM constructs intermediate states along the FM paths from these representations. During training, we introduce an orthogonal projection method to adaptively determine the temporal position of these states, and apply a principled construction strategy based on a single-segment piecewise flow. The SFM inference starts from the intermediate state rather than pure noise, thereby focusing computation on the latter stages of the FM paths. We integrate SFM into multiple TTS models with a lightweight SFM head. Experiments demonstrate that SFM yields consistent gains in speech naturalness across both objective and subjective evaluations, and significantly accelerates inference when using adaptive-step ODE solvers.

Title: From High-SNR Radar Signal to ECG: A Transfer Learning Model with Cardio-Focusing Algorithm for Scenarios with Limited Data
Authors: Yuanyuan Zhang, Haocheng Zhao, Sijie Xiong, Rui Yang, Eng Gee Lim, Yutao Yue
Abstract: Electrocardiogram (ECG), as a crucial find-grained cardiac feature, has been successfully recovered from radar signals in the literature, but the performance heavily relies on the high-quality radar signal and numerous radar-ECG pairs for training, restricting the applications in new scenarios due to data scarcity. Therefore, this work will focus on radar-based ECG recovery in new scenarios with limited data and propose a cardio-focusing and -tracking (CFT) algorithm to precisely track the cardiac location to ensure an efficient acquisition of high-quality radar signals. Furthermore, a transfer learning model (RFcardi) is proposed to extract cardio-related information from the radar signal without ECG ground truth based on the intrinsic sparsity of cardiac features, and only a few synchronous radar-ECG pairs are required to fine-tune the pre-trained model for the ECG recovery. The experimental results reveal that the proposed CFT can dynamically identify the cardiac location, and the RFcardi model can effectively generate faithful ECG recoveries after using a small number of radar-ECG pairs for training. The code and dataset are available after the publication.

Title: Posterior Cramér-Rao Bounds on Localization and Mapping Errors in Distributed MIMO SLAM
Authors: Benjamin J. B. Deutschmann, Xuhong Li, Florian Meyer, Erik Leitinger
Abstract: Radio-frequency simultaneous localization and mapping (RF-SLAM) methods jointly infer the position of mobile transmitters and receivers in wireless networks, together with a geometric map of the propagation environment. An inferred map of specular surfaces can be used to exploit non-line-of-sight components of the multipath channel to increase robustness, bypass obstructions, and improve overall communication and positioning performance. While performance bounds for user location are well established, the literature lacks performance bounds for map information. This paper derives the mapping error bound (MEB), i.e., the posterior Cramér-Rao lower bound on the position and orientation of specular surfaces, for RF-SLAM. In particular, we consider a very general scenario with single- and double-bounce reflections, as well as distributed anchors. We demonstrate numerically that a state-of-the-art RF-SLAM algorithm asymptotically converges to this MEB. The bounds assess not only the localization (position and orientation) but also the mapping performance of RF-SLAM algorithms in terms of global features.

Title: Quantization-Aware Neuromorphic Architecture for Efficient Skin Disease Classification on Resource-Constrained Devices
Authors: Haitian Wang, Xinyu Wang, Yiren Wang, Zichen Geng, Xian Zhang, Yu Zhang, Bo Miao
Abstract: Accurate and efficient skin lesion classification on edge devices is critical for accessible dermatological care but remains challenging due to computational, energy, and privacy constraints. We introduce QANA, a novel quantization-aware neuromorphic architecture for incremental skin lesion classification on resource-limited hardware. QANA effectively integrates ghost modules, efficient channel attention, and squeeze-and-excitation blocks for robust feature representation with low-latency and energy-efficient inference. Its quantization-aware head and spike-compatible transformations enable seamless conversion to spiking neural networks (SNNs) and deployment on neuromorphic platforms. Evaluation on the large-scale HAM10000 benchmark and a real-world clinical dataset shows that QANA achieves 91.6% Top-1 accuracy and 82.4% macro F1 on HAM10000, and 90.8%/81.7% on the clinical dataset, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN models under fair comparison. Deployed on BrainChip Akida hardware, QANA achieves 1.5 ms inference latency and 1.7,mJ energy per image, reducing inference latency and energy use by over 94.6%/98.6% compared to GPU-based CNNs surpassing state-of-the-art CNN-to-SNN conversion baselines. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of QANA for accurate, real-time, and privacy-sensitive medical analysis in edge environments.

Title: Revisiting Functional Derivatives in Multi-object Tracking
Authors: Jan Krejčí, Ondřej Straka, Petr Girg, Jiří Benedikt
Abstract: Probability generating functionals (PGFLs) are efficient and powerful tools for tracking independent objects in clutter. It was shown that PGFLs could be used for the elegant derivation of practical multi-object tracking algorithms, e.g., the probability hypothesis density (PHD) filter. However, derivations using PGFLs use the so-called functional derivatives whose definitions usually appear too complicated or heuristic, involving Dirac delta ``functions''. This paper begins by comparing different definitions of functional derivatives and exploring their relationships and implications for practical applications. It then proposes a rigorous definition of the functional derivative, utilizing straightforward yet precise mathematics for clarity. Key properties of the functional derivative are revealed and discussed.

Title: Prognostic Framework for Robotic Manipulators Operating Under Dynamic Task Severities
Authors: Ayush Mohanty, Jason Dekarske, Stephen K. Robinson, Sanjay Joshi, Nagi Gebraeel
Abstract: Robotic manipulators are critical in many applications but are known to degrade over time. This degradation is influenced by the nature of the tasks performed by the robot. Tasks with higher severity, such as handling heavy payloads, can accelerate the degradation process. One way this degradation is reflected is in the position accuracy of the robot's end-effector. In this paper, we present a prognostic modeling framework that predicts a robotic manipulator's Remaining Useful Life (RUL) while accounting for the effects of task severity. Our framework represents the robot's position accuracy as a Brownian motion process with a random drift parameter that is influenced by task severity. The dynamic nature of task severity is modeled using a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). To evaluate RUL, we discuss two approaches -- (1) a novel closed-form expression for Remaining Lifetime Distribution (RLD), and (2) Monte Carlo simulations, commonly used in prognostics literature. Theoretical results establish the equivalence between these RUL computation approaches. We validate our framework through experiments using two distinct physics-based simulators for planar and spatial robot fleets. Our findings show that robots in both fleets experience shorter RUL when handling a higher proportion of high-severity tasks.

Title: LAMA-UT: Language Agnostic Multilingual ASR through Orthography Unification and Language-Specific Transliteration
Authors: Sangmin Lee, Woo-Jin Chung, Hong-Goo Kang
Abstract: Building a universal multilingual automatic speech recognition (ASR) model that performs equitably across languages has long been a challenge due to its inherent difficulties. To address this task we introduce a Language-Agnostic Multilingual ASR pipeline through orthography Unification and language-specific Transliteration (LAMA-UT). LAMA-UT operates without any language-specific modules while matching the performance of state-of-the-art models trained on a minimal amount of data. Our pipeline consists of two key steps. First, we utilize a universal transcription generator to unify orthographic features into Romanized form and capture common phonetic characteristics across diverse languages. Second, we utilize a universal converter to transform these universal transcriptions into language-specific ones. In experiments, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method leveraging universal transcriptions for massively multilingual ASR. Our pipeline achieves a relative error reduction rate of 45% when compared to Whisper and performs comparably to MMS, despite being trained on only 0.1% of Whisper's training data. Furthermore, our pipeline does not rely on any language-specific modules. However, it performs on par with zero-shot ASR approaches which utilize additional language-specific lexicons and language models. We expect this framework to serve as a cornerstone for flexible multilingual ASR systems that are generalizable even to unseen languages.

Title: Equity-aware Design and Timing of Fare-free Transit Zoning under Demand Uncertainty
Authors: Qianwen Guo, Jiaqing Lu, Joseph Y. J. Chow, Paul Schonfeld
Abstract: We propose the first analytical stochastic model for optimizing the configuration and implementation policies of fare-free transit. The model focuses on a transportation corridor with two transportation modes: automobiles and buses. The corridor is divided into two sections, an inner one with fare-free transit service and an outer one with fare-based transit service. Under the static version of the model, the optimized length and frequency of the fare-free transit zone can be determined by maximizing total social welfare. The findings indicate that implementing fare-free transit can increase transit ridership and reduce automobile use within the fare-free zone while social equity among the demand groups can be enhanced by lengthening the fare-free zone. Notably, the optimal zone length increases when both social welfare and equity are considered jointly, compared to only prioritizing social welfare. The dynamic model, framed within a market entry and exit real options approach, solves the fare policy switching problem, establishing optimal timing policies for activating or terminating fare-free service. The results from dynamic models reveal earlier implementation and extended durations of fare-free transit in the social welfare-aware regime, driven by lower thresholds compared to the social equity-aware regime.

Authors: Jiahe Li, Xin Chen, Fanqi Shen, Junru Chen, Yuxin Liu, Daoze Zhang, Zhizhang Yuan, Fang Zhao, Meng Li, Yang Yang
Abstract: Neurological disorders pose major global health challenges, driving advances in brain signal analysis. Scalp electroencephalography (EEG) and intracranial EEG (iEEG) are widely used for diagnosis and monitoring. However, dataset heterogeneity and task variations hinder the development of robust deep learning solutions. This review systematically examines recent advances in deep learning approaches for EEG/iEEG-based neurological diagnostics, focusing on applications across 7 neurological conditions using 46 datasets. For each condition, we review representative methods and their quantitative results, integrating performance comparisons with analyses of data usage, model design, and task-specific adaptations, while highlighting the role of pre-trained multi-task models in achieving scalable, generalizable solutions. Finally, we propose a standardized benchmark to evaluate models across diverse datasets and improve reproducibility, emphasizing how recent innovations are transforming neurological diagnostics toward intelligent, adaptable healthcare systems.

Title: DIPLI: Deep Image Prior Lucky Imaging for Blind Astronomical Image Restoration
Authors: Suraj Singh, Anastasia Batsheva, Oleg Y. Rogov, Ahmed Bouridane
Abstract: Modern image restoration and super-resolution methods utilize deep learning due to its superior performance compared to traditional algorithms. However, deep learning typically requires large training datasets, which are rarely available in astrophotography. Deep Image Prior (DIP) bypasses this constraint by performing blind training on a single image. Although effective in some cases, DIP often suffers from overfitting, artifact generation, and instability. To overcome these issues and improve general performance, this work proposes DIPLI - a framework that shifts from single-frame to multi-frame training using the Back Projection technique, combined with optical flow estimation via the TVNet model, and replaces deterministic predictions with unbiased Monte Carlo estimation obtained through Langevin dynamics. A comprehensive evaluation compares the method against Lucky Imaging, a classical computer vision technique still widely used in astronomical image reconstruction, DIP, the transformer-based model RVRT, and the diffusion-based model DiffIR2VR-Zero. Experiments on synthetic datasets demonstrate consistent improvements, with the method outperforming baselines for SSIM, PSNR, LPIPS, and DISTS metrics in the majority of cases. In addition to superior reconstruction quality, the model also requires far fewer input images than Lucky Imaging and is less prone to overfitting or artifact generation. Evaluation on real-world astronomical data, where domain shifts typically hinder generalization, shows that the method maintains high reconstruction quality, confirming practical robustness.

Title: Towards Machine Learning-based Model Predictive Control for HVAC Control in Multi-Context Buildings at Scale via Ensemble Learning
Authors: Yang Deng, Yaohui Liu, Rui Liang, Dafang Zhao, Donghua Xie, Ittetsu Taniguchi, Dan Wang
Abstract: The building thermodynamics model, which predicts real-time indoor temperature changes under potential HVAC (Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning) control operations, is crucial for optimizing HVAC control in buildings. While pioneering studies have attempted to develop such models for various building environments, these models often require extensive data collection periods and rely heavily on expert knowledge, making the modeling process inefficient and limiting the reusability of the models. This paper explores a model ensemble perspective that utilizes existing developed models as base models to serve a target building environment, thereby providing accurate predictions while reducing the associated efforts. Given that building data streams are non-stationary and the number of base models may increase, we propose a Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning (HRL) approach to dynamically select and weight the base models. Our approach employs a two-tiered decision-making process: the high-level focuses on model selection, while the low-level determines the weights of the selected models. We thoroughly evaluate the proposed approach through offline experiments and an on-site case study, and the experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our method.

Title: Deep Learning for Continuous-time Stochastic Control with Jumps
Authors: Patrick Cheridito, Jean-Loup Dupret, Donatien Hainaut
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a model-based deep-learning approach to solve finite-horizon continuous-time stochastic control problems with jumps. We iteratively train two neural networks: one to represent the optimal policy and the other to approximate the value function. Leveraging a continuous-time version of the dynamic programming principle, we derive two different training objectives based on the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, ensuring that the networks capture the underlying stochastic dynamics. Empirical evaluations on different problems illustrate the accuracy and scalability of our approach, demonstrating its effectiveness in solving complex, high-dimensional stochastic control tasks.

Title: LeVo: High-Quality Song Generation with Multi-Preference Alignment
Authors: Shun Lei, Yaoxun Xu, Zhiwei Lin, Huaicheng Zhang, Wei Tan, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Yixuan Zhang, Chenyu Yang, Haina Zhu, Shuai Wang, Zhiyong Wu, Dong Yu
Abstract: Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) and audio language models have significantly improved music generation, particularly in lyrics-to-song generation. However, existing approaches still struggle with the complex composition of songs and the scarcity of high-quality data, leading to limitations in audio quality, musicality, instruction following, and vocal-instrument harmony. To address these challenges, we introduce LeVo, a language model based framework consisting of LeLM and Music Codec. LeLM is capable of parallel modeling of two types of tokens: mixed tokens, which represent the combined audio of vocals and accompaniment to achieve better vocal-instrument harmony, and dual-track tokens, which separately encode vocals and accompaniment for high-quality song generation. It employs two decoder-only transformers and a modular extension training strategy to prevent interference between different token types. To further enhance musicality and instruction following ability, we introduce a multi-preference alignment method based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO). This method handles diverse human preferences through a semi-automatic data construction process and post-training. Experimental results demonstrate that LeVo significantly outperforms existing open-source methods in both objective and subjective metrics, while performing competitively with industry systems. Ablation studies further justify the effectiveness of our designs. Audio examples and source code are available at this https URL and this https URL.

Title: Nuisance parameters and elliptically symmetric distributions: a geometric approach to parametric and semiparametric efficiency
Authors: Stefano Fortunati, Jean-Pierre Delmas, Esa Ollila
Abstract: Elliptically symmetric distributions are a classic example of a semiparametric model where the location vector and the scatter matrix (or a parameterization of them) are the two finite-dimensional parameters of interest, while the density generator represents an \textit{infinite-dimensional nuisance} term. This basic representation of the elliptic model can be made more accurate, rich, and flexible by considering additional \textit{finite-dimensional nuisance} parameters. Our aim is therefore to investigate the deep and counter-intuitive links between statistical efficiency in estimating the parameters of interest in the presence of both finite and infinite-dimensional nuisance parameters. Unlike previous works that addressed this problem using Le Cam's asymptotic theory, our approach here is purely geometric: efficiency will be analyzed using tools such as projections and tangent spaces embedded in the relevant Hilbert space. This allows us to obtain original results also for the case where the location vector and the scatter matrix are parameterized by a finite-dimensional vector that can be partitioned in two sub-vectors: one containing the parameters of interest and the other containing the nuisance parameters. As an example, we illustrate how the obtained results can be applied to the well-known \virg{low-rank} parameterization. Furthermore, while the theoretical analysis will be developed for Real Elliptically Symmetric (RES) distributions, we show how to extend our results to the case of Circular and Non-Circular Complex Elliptically Symmetric (C-CES and NC-CES) distributions.

Title: Bayesian Optimization of Process Parameters of a Sensor-Based Sorting System using Gaussian Processes as Surrogate Models
Authors: Felix Kronenwett, Georg Maier, Thomas Längle
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Title: Sparse Autoencoder Neural Operators: Model Recovery in Function Spaces
Authors: Bahareh Tolooshams, Ailsa Shen, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: We frame the problem of unifying representations in neural models as one of sparse model recovery and introduce a framework that extends sparse autoencoders (SAEs) to lifted spaces and infinite-dimensional function spaces, enabling mechanistic interpretability of large neural operators (NO). While the Platonic Representation Hypothesis suggests that neural networks converge to similar representations across architectures, the representational properties of neural operators remain underexplored despite their growing importance in scientific computing. We compare the inference and training dynamics of SAEs, lifted-SAE, and SAE neural operators. We highlight how lifting and operator modules introduce beneficial inductive biases, enabling faster recovery, improved recovery of smooth concepts, and robust inference across varying resolutions, a property unique to neural operators.
