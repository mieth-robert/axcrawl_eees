Title: Clinically-aligned Multi-modal Chest X-ray Classification
Authors: Phillip Sloan, Edwin Simpson, Majid Mirmehdi
Abstract: Radiology is essential to modern healthcare, yet rising demand and staffing shortages continue to pose major challenges. Recent advances in artificial intelligence have the potential to support radiologists and help address these challenges. Given its widespread use and clinical importance, chest X-ray classification is well suited to augment radiologists' workflows. However, most existing approaches rely solely on single-view, image-level inputs, ignoring the structured clinical information and multi-image studies available at the time of reporting. In this work, we introduce CaMCheX, a multimodal transformer-based framework that aligns multi-view chest X-ray studies with structured clinical data to better reflect how clinicians make diagnostic decisions. Our architecture employs view-specific ConvNeXt encoders for frontal and lateral chest radiographs, whose features are fused with clinical indications, history, and vital signs using a transformer fusion module. This design enables the model to generate context-aware representations that mirror reasoning in clinical practice. Our results exceed the state of the art for both the original MIMIC-CXR dataset and the more recent CXR-LT benchmarks, highlighting the value of clinically grounded multimodal alignment for advancing chest X-ray classification.

Title: Diffusion-Based Quality Control of Medical Image Segmentations across Organs
Authors: Vincenzo Marcianò, Hava Chaptoukaev, Virginia Fernandez, M. Jorge Cardoso, Sébastien Ourselin, Michela Antonelli, Maria A. Zuluaga
Abstract: Medical image segmentation using deep learning (DL) has enabled the development of automated analysis pipelines for large-scale population studies. However, state-of-the-art DL methods are prone to hallucinations, which can result in anatomically implausible segmentations. With manual correction impractical at scale, automated quality control (QC) techniques have to address the challenge. While promising, existing QC methods are organ-specific, limiting their generalizability and usability beyond their original intended task. To overcome this limitation, we propose no-new Quality Control (nnQC), a robust QC framework based on a diffusion-generative paradigm that self-adapts to any input organ dataset. Central to nnQC is a novel Team of Experts (ToE) architecture, where two specialized experts independently encode 3D spatial awareness, represented by the relative spatial position of an axial slice, and anatomical information derived from visual features from the original image. A weighted conditional module dynamically combines the pair of independent embeddings, or opinions to condition the sampling mechanism within a diffusion process, enabling the generation of a spatially aware pseudo-ground truth for predicting QC scores. Within its framework, nnQC integrates fingerprint adaptation to ensure adaptability across organs, datasets, and imaging modalities. We evaluated nnQC on seven organs using twelve publicly available datasets. Our results demonstrate that nnQC consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods across all experiments, including cases where segmentation masks are highly degraded or completely missing, confirming its versatility and effectiveness across different organs.

Title: Segment Any Tumour: An Uncertainty-Aware Vision Foundation Model for Whole-Body Analysis
Authors: Himashi Peiris, Sizhe Wang, Gary Egan, Mehrtash Harandi, Meng Law, Zhaolin Chen
Abstract: Prompt-driven vision foundation models, such as the Segment Anything Model, have recently demonstrated remarkable adaptability in computer vision. However, their direct application to medical imaging remains challenging due to heterogeneous tissue structures, imaging artefacts, and low-contrast boundaries, particularly in tumours and cancer primaries leading to suboptimal segmentation in ambiguous or overlapping lesion regions. Here, we present Segment Any Tumour 3D (SAT3D), a lightweight volumetric foundation model designed to enable robust and generalisable tumour segmentation across diverse medical imaging modalities. SAT3D integrates a shifted-window vision transformer for hierarchical volumetric representation with an uncertainty-aware training pipeline that explicitly incorporates uncertainty estimates as prompts to guide reliable boundary prediction in low-contrast regions. Adversarial learning further enhances model performance for the ambiguous pathological regions. We benchmark SAT3D against three recent vision foundation models and nnUNet across 11 publicly available datasets, encompassing 3,884 tumour and cancer cases for training and 694 cases for in-distribution evaluation. Trained on 17,075 3D volume-mask pairs across multiple modalities and cancer primaries, SAT3D demonstrates strong generalisation and robustness. To facilitate practical use and clinical translation, we developed a 3D Slicer plugin that enables interactive, prompt-driven segmentation and visualisation using the trained SAT3D model. Extensive experiments highlight its effectiveness in improving segmentation accuracy under challenging and out-of-distribution scenarios, underscoring its potential as a scalable foundation model for medical image analysis.

Title: SuperRivolution: Fine-Scale Rivers from Coarse Temporal Satellite Imagery
Authors: Rangel Daroya, Subhransu Maji
Abstract: Satellite missions provide valuable optical data for monitoring rivers at diverse spatial and temporal scales. However, accessibility remains a challenge: high-resolution imagery is ideal for fine-grained monitoring but is typically scarce and expensive compared to low-resolution imagery. To address this gap, we introduce SuperRivolution, a framework that improves river segmentation resolution by leveraging information from time series of low-resolution satellite images. We contribute a new benchmark dataset of 9,810 low-resolution temporal images paired with high-resolution labels from an existing river monitoring dataset. Using this benchmark, we investigate multiple strategies for river segmentation, including ensembling single-image models, applying image super-resolution, and developing end-to-end models trained on temporal sequences. SuperRivolution significantly outperforms single-image methods and baseline temporal approaches, narrowing the gap with supervised high-resolution models. For example, the F1 score for river segmentation improves from 60.9% to 80.5%, while the state-of-the-art model operating on high-resolution images achieves 94.1%. Similar improvements are also observed in river width estimation tasks. Our results highlight the potential of publicly available low-resolution satellite archives for fine-scale river monitoring.

Title: Bridging the Data Gap: Spatially Conditioned Diffusion Model for Anomaly Generation in Photovoltaic Electroluminescence Images
Authors: Shiva Hanifi, Sasan Jafarnejad, Marc Köntges, Andrej Wentnagel, Andreas Kokkas, Raphael Frank
Abstract: Reliable anomaly detection in photovoltaic (PV) modules is critical for maintaining solar energy efficiency. However, developing robust computer vision models for PV inspection is constrained by the scarcity of large-scale, diverse, and balanced datasets. This study introduces PV-DDPM, a spatially conditioned denoising diffusion probabilistic model that generates anomalous electroluminescence (EL) images across four PV cell types: multi-crystalline silicon (multi-c-Si), mono-crystalline silicon (mono-c-Si), half-cut multi-c-Si, and interdigitated back contact (IBC) with dogbone interconnect. PV-DDPM enables controlled synthesis of single-defect and multi-defect scenarios by conditioning on binary masks representing structural features and defect positions. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first framework that jointly models multiple PV cell types while supporting simultaneous generation of diverse anomaly types. We also introduce E-SCDD, an enhanced version of the SCDD dataset, comprising 1,000 pixel-wise annotated EL images spanning 30 semantic classes, and 1,768 unlabeled synthetic samples. Quantitative evaluation shows our generated images achieve a Fréchet Inception Distance (FID) of 4.10 and Kernel Inception Distance (KID) of 0.0023 $\pm$ 0.0007 across all categories. Training the vision--language anomaly detection model AA-CLIP on E-SCDD, compared to the SCDD dataset, improves pixel-level AUC and average precision by 1.70 and 8.34 points, respectively.

Title: TomoGraphView: 3D Medical Image Classification with Omnidirectional Slice Representations and Graph Neural Networks
Authors: Johannes Kiechle, Stefan M. Fischer, Daniel M. Lang, Cosmin I. Bercea, Matthew J. Nyflot, Lina Felsner, Julia A. Schnabel, Jan C. Peeken
Abstract: The growing number of medical tomography examinations has necessitated the development of automated methods capable of extracting comprehensive imaging features to facilitate downstream tasks such as tumor characterization, while assisting physicians in managing their growing workload. However, 3D medical image classification remains a challenging task due to the complex spatial relationships and long-range dependencies inherent in volumetric data. Training models from scratch suffers from low data regimes, and the absence of 3D large-scale multimodal datasets has limited the development of 3D medical imaging foundation models. Recent studies, however, have highlighted the potential of 2D vision foundation models, originally trained on natural images, as powerful feature extractors for medical image analysis. Despite these advances, existing approaches that apply 2D models to 3D volumes via slice-based decomposition remain suboptimal. Conventional volume slicing strategies, which rely on canonical planes such as axial, sagittal, or coronal, may inadequately capture the spatial extent of target structures when these are misaligned with standardized viewing planes. Furthermore, existing slice-wise aggregation strategies rarely account for preserving the volumetric structure, resulting in a loss of spatial coherence across slices. To overcome these limitations, we propose TomoGraphView, a novel framework that integrates omnidirectional volume slicing with spherical graph-based feature aggregation. We publicly share our accessible code base at this http URL and provide a user-friendly library for omnidirectional volume slicing at this https URL.

Title: TempRetinex: Retinex-based Unsupervised Enhancement for Low-light Video Under Diverse Lighting Conditions
Authors: Yini Li, Nantheera Anantrasirichai
Abstract: Videos inherently contain rich temporal information that provides complementary cues for low-light enhancement beyond what can be achieved with single images. We propose TempRetinex, a novel unsupervised Retinex-based framework that effectively exploits inter-frame correlations for video enhancement. To address the poor generalization of existing unsupervised methods under varying illumination, we introduce adaptive brightness adjustment (ABA) preprocessing that explicitly aligns lighting distributions across exposures. This significantly improves model robustness to diverse lighting scenarios and eases training optimization, leading to better denoising performance. For enhanced temporal coherence, we propose a multi-scale temporal consistency-aware loss to enforce multiscale similarity between consecutive frames, and an occlusion-aware masking technique to handle complex motions. We further incorporate a reverse inference strategy to refine unconverged frames and a self-ensemble (SE) mechanism to boost the denoising across diverse textures. Experiments demonstrate that TempRetinex achieves state-of-the-art performance in both perceptual quality and temporal consistency, achieving up to a 29.7% PSNR gain over prior methods.

Title: Statistically Consistent Approximate Model Predictive Control
Authors: Elias Milios, Kim P. Wabersich, Felix Berkel, Felix Gruber, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) offers rigorous safety and performance guarantees but is computationally intensive. Approximate MPC (AMPC) aims to circumvent this drawback by learning a computationally cheaper surrogate policy. Common approaches focus on imitation learning (IL) via behavioral cloning (BC), minimizing a mean-squared-error loss on a collection of state-input pairs. However, BC fundamentally fails to provide accurate approximations when MPC solutions are set-valued due to non-convex constraints or local minima. We propose a two-stage IL procedure to accurately approximate nonlinear, potentially set-valued MPC policies. The method integrates an approximation of the MPC's optimal value function into a one-step look-ahead loss function, and thereby embeds the MPC's constraint and performance objectives into the IL this http URL is achieved by adopting a stabilizing soft constrained MPC formulation, which reflects constraint violations in the optimal value function by combining a constraint tightening with slack penalties. We prove statistical consistency for policies that exactly minimize our IL objective, implying convergence to a safe and stabilizing control law, and establish input-to-state stability guarantees for approximate minimizers. Simulations demonstrate improved performance compared to BC.

Title: A Fourier-Based Global Denoising Model for Smart Artifacts Removing of Microscopy Images
Authors: Huanhuan Zhao, Connor Vernachio, Laxmi Bhurtel, Wooin Yang, Ruben Millan-Solsona, Spenser R. Brown, Marti Checa, Komal Sharma Agrawal, Adam M. Guss, Liam Collins, Wonhee Ko, Arpan Biswas
Abstract: Microscopy such as Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) and Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) are essential tools in material imaging at micro- and nanoscale resolutions to extract physical knowledge and materials structure-property relationships. However, tuning microscopy controls (e.g. scanning speed, current setpoint, tip bias etc.) to obtain a high-quality of images is a non-trivial and time-consuming effort. On the other hand, with sub-standard images, the key features are not accurately discovered due to noise and artifacts, leading to erroneous analysis. Existing denoising models mostly build on generalizing the weak signals as noises while the strong signals are enhanced as key features, which is not always the case in microscopy images, thus can completely erase a significant amount of hidden physical information. To address these limitations, we propose a global denoising model (GDM) to smartly remove artifacts of microscopy images while preserving weaker but physically important features. The proposed model is developed based on 1) first designing a two-imaging input channel of non-pair and goal specific pre-processed images with user-defined trade-off information between two channels and 2) then integrating a loss function of pixel- and fast Fourier-transformed (FFT) based on training the U-net model. We compared the proposed GDM with the non-FFT denoising model over STM-generated images of Copper(Cu) and Silicon(Si) materials, AFM-generated Pantoea sp.YR343 bio-film images and SEM-generated plastic degradation images. We believe this proposed workflow can be extended to improve other microscopy image quality and will benefit the experimentalists with the proposed design flexibility to smartly tune via domain-experts preferences.

Title: Robust Time-Varying Control Barrier Functions with Sector-Bounded Nonlinearities
Authors: Jungbae Chun, Felix Biertümpfel, Peter Seiler
Abstract: This paper presents a novel approach for ensuring safe operation of systems subject to input nonlinearities and time-varying safety constraints. We formulate robust time-varying control barrier functions by combining two ingredients: (i) time-varying control barrier functions which capture the time-varying safety constraints, and (ii) pointwise-in-time quadratic constraints that bound the nonlinearity. These ingredients are used to design a safety filter. This filter ensures safety while minimally altering the command from a given baseline controller. The safety filter is implemented as the solution of a second-order cone program, which can be efficiently computed online. The approach is demonstrated on a simple car obstacle avoidance scenario.

Title: A Smooth Penalty-Based Feedback Law for Reactive Obstacle Avoidance with Convergence Guarantees
Authors: Lyes Smaili, Soulaimane Berkane
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of safe autonomous navigation in unknown obstacle-filled environments using only local sensory information. We propose a smooth feedback controller derived from an unconstrained penalty-based formulation that guarantees safety by construction. The controller modifies an arbitrary nominal input through a closed-form expression. The resulting closed-form feedback has a projection structure that interpolates between the nominal control and its orthogonal projection onto the obstacle boundary, ensuring forward invariance of a user-defined safety margin. The control law depends only on the distance and bearing to obstacles and requires no map, switching, or set construction. When the nominal input is a gradient descent of a navigation potential, we prove that the closed-loop system achieves almost global asymptotic stability (AGAS) to the goal. Undesired equilibria are shown to be unstable under a mild geometric curvature condition, which compares the normal curvature of the obstacle boundary with that of the potential level sets. We refer to the proposed method as SPF (Safe Penalty-based Feedback), which ensures safe and smooth navigation with minimal computational overhead, as demonstrated through simulations in complex 2D and 3D environments.

Title: Investigation of Feature Selection and Pooling Methods for Environmental Sound Classification
Authors: Parinaz Binandeh Dehaghani, Danilo Pena, A. Pedro Aguiar
Abstract: This paper explores the impact of dimensionality reduction and pooling methods for Environmental Sound Classification (ESC) using lightweight CNNs. We evaluate Sparse Salient Region Pooling (SSRP) and its variants, SSRP-Basic (SSRP-B) and SSRP-Top-K (SSRP-T), under various hyperparameter settings and compare them with Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Experiments on the ESC-50 dataset demonstrate that SSRP-T achieves up to 80.69 % accuracy, significantly outperforming both the baseline CNN (66.75 %) and the PCA-reduced model (37.60 %). Our findings confirm that a well-tuned sparse pooling strategy provides a robust, efficient, and high-performing solution for ESC tasks, particularly in resource-constrained scenarios where balancing accuracy and computational cost is crucial.

Title: Massive MIMO-OFDM Channel Acquisition with Multi-group Adjustable Phase Shift Pilots
Authors: Yu Zhao, Li You, Jinke Tang, Mengyu Qian, Bin Jiang, Xiang-Gen Xia, Xiqi Gao
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output - orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-OFDM) systems face the challenge of high channel acquisition overhead while providing significant spectral efficiency (SE). Adjustable phase shift pilots (APSPs) are an effective technique to acquire channels with low overhead by exploiting channel sparsity. In this paper, we extend it to multiple groups and propose multi-group adjustable phase shift pilots (MAPSPs) to improve SE further. We first introduce a massive MIMO-OFDM system model and transform the conventional channel model in the space-frequency domain to the angle-delay domain, obtaining a sparse channel matrix. Then, we propose a method of generating MAPSPs through multiple basic sequences and investigate channel estimation processes. By analyzing the components of pilot interference, we elucidate the underlying mechanism by which interference affects MMSE estimation. Building upon this foundation, we demonstrate the benefit of phase scheduling in MAPSP channel estimation and establish the optimal design condition tailored for scheduling. Furthermore, we propose an implementation scheme based on Zadoff-Chu sequences that includes received signal pre-processing and pilot scheduling methods to mitigate pilot interference. Simulation results indicate that the MAPSP method achieves a lower mean square error (MSE) of estimation than APSP and significantly enhances SE in mobility scenarios.

Title: Resilient Controller Design with Exponential Reaching Law for Enhanced Load Frequency Stability in Multi-Area Interconnected Microgrids
Authors: Md Saiful Islam, Rahul Bhadani
Abstract: We present a load frequency control strategy deploying a decentralized robust global integral terminal sliding mode control (GITSMC) method to maintain stable frequency and tie-line power in multi-area interconnected microgrids with aggregated uncertainties. To achieve this, firstly, we have developed a mathematical model of the multi-area interconnected system incorporating disturbances from solar photovoltaic (PV), wind turbine (WT) generation and load demand, as aggregated uncertainties. Secondly, we have designed a global integral terminal sliding surface with an exponential reaching law for each area to enhance system dynamic performance and suppress chattering within a finite time. Thirdly, the overall stability of the closed-loop system is analyzed using the Lyapunov stability theorem. Finally, extensive simulations are conducted on the IEEE 10-generator New England 39-bus power system, including load disturbances and variable PV and WT generation. The results demonstrate the performance of the proposed GITSMC approach, achieving approximately 94.9% improvement in ITSE and 94.4% improvement in ISE, confirming its superior accuracy and dynamic performance compared to the existing controller.

Title: Electromagnetic Quantitative Inversion for Translationally Moving Targets via Phase Correlation Registration of Back-Projection Images
Authors: Yitao Lin, Dahai Dai, Shilong Sun, Yuchen Wu, Bo Pang
Abstract: An novel electromagnetic quantitative inversion scheme for translationally moving targets via phase correlation registration of back-projection (BP) images is proposed. Based on a time division multiplexing multiple-input multiple-output (TDM-MIMO) radar architecture, the scheme first achieves high-precision relative positioning of the target, then applies relative motion compensation to perform iterative inversion on multi-cycle MIMO measurement data, thereby reconstructing the target's electromagnetic parameters. As a general framework compatible with other mainstream inversion algorithms, we exemplify our approach by incorporating the classical cross-correlated contrast source inversion (CC-CSI) into iterative optimization step of the scheme, resulting in a new algorithm termed RMC-CC-CSI. Numerical and experimental results demonstrate that RMC-CC-CSI offers accelerated convergence, enhanced reconstruction fidelity, and improved noise immunity over conventional CC-CSI for stationary targets despite increased computational cost.

Title: Learning phase diversity for solving ill-posed inverse problems in imaging
Authors: Jasleen Birdi, Tamal Majumder, Debanjan Halder, Muskan Kularia, Kedar Khare
Abstract: Inverse problems in imaging are typically ill-posed and are usually solved by employing regularized optimization techniques. The usage of appropriate constraints can restrict the solution space, thus making it feasible for a reconstruction algorithm to find a meaningful solution. In recent years, deep network based ideas aimed at learning the end-to-end mapping between the raw measurements and the target image have gained popularity. In the learning approach, the functional relationship between the measured raw data and the solution image are learned by training a deep network with prior examples. While this approach allows one to significantly increase the real-time operational speed, it does not change the nature of the underlying ill-posed inverse problem. It is well-known that availability of diverse non-redundant data via additional measurements can generically improve the robustness of the reconstruction algorithms. The multiple data measurements, however, typically demand additional hardware and complex system setups that are not desirable. In this work, we note that in both incoherent and coherent optical imaging, the irradiance patterns corresponding to two phase diverse measurements associated with the same test object have implicit local correlation which may be learned. A physics informed data augmentation scheme is then described where a trained network is used for generating a phase diverse pseudo-data based on a ground truth data frame. The true data along with the augmented pesudo-data are observed to provide high quality inverse solutions with simpler reconstruction algorithms. We validate this approach for both incoherent and coherent optical imaging (or phase retrieval) configurations with vortex phase as a diversity mechanism. Our results may open new avenues for leaner high-fidelity computational imaging systems across a broad range of applications.

Title: ASSENT: Learning-Based Association Optimization for Distributed Cell-Free ISAC
Authors: Mehdi Zafari, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Integrated Sensing and Communication (ISAC) is a key emerging 6G technology. Despite progress, ISAC still lacks scalable methods for joint AP clustering and user/target scheduling in distributed deployments under fronthaul limits. Moreover, existing ISAC solutions largely rely on centralized processing and full channel state information, limiting scalability. This paper addresses joint access point (AP) clustering, user and target scheduling, and AP mode selection in distributed cell-free ISAC systems operating with constrained fronthaul capacity. We formulate the problem as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly captures interference coupling, RF-chain limits, and sensing requirements, providing optimal but computationally demanding solutions. To enable real-time and scalable operation, we propose ASSENT (ASSociation and ENTity selection), a graph neural network (GNN) framework trained on MILP solutions to efficiently learn association and mode-selection policies directly from lightweight link statistics. Simulations show that ASSENT achieves near-optimal utility while accurately learning the underlying associations. Additionally, its single forward pass inference reduces decision latency compared to optimization-based methods. An open-source Python/PyTorch implementation with full datasets is provided to facilitate reproducible and extensible research in cell-free ISAC.

Title: Time-Layer Adaptive Alignment for Speaker Similarity in Flow-Matching Based Zero-Shot TTS
Authors: Haoyu Li, Mingyang Han, Yu Xi, Dongxiao Wang, Hankun Wang, Haoxiang Shi, Boyu Li, Jun Song, Bo Zheng, Shuai Wang
Abstract: Flow-Matching (FM)-based zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) systems exhibit high-quality speech synthesis and robust generalization capabilities. However, the speaker representation ability of such systems remains underexplored, primarily due to the lack of explicit speaker-specific supervision in the FM framework. To this end, we conduct an empirical analysis of speaker information distribution and reveal its non-uniform allocation across time steps and network layers, underscoring the need for adaptive speaker alignment. Accordingly, we propose Time-Layer Adaptive Speaker Alignment (TLA-SA), a loss that enhances speaker consistency by jointly leveraging temporal and hierarchical variations in speaker information. Experimental results show that TLA-SA significantly improves speaker similarity compared to baseline systems on both research- and industrial-scale datasets and generalizes effectively across diverse model architectures, including decoder-only language models (LM) and FM-based TTS systems free of LM.

Title: Rotatable IRS Aided Wireless Communication
Authors: Qiaoyan Peng, Qingqing Wu, Guangji Chen, Wen Chen, Shaodan Ma, Shanpu Shen, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Rotatable intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) introduces a new spatial degree of freedom (DoF) by dynamically adjusting orientations without the need of changing its elements' positions in real time. To unleash the full potential of rotatable IRSs for wireless communications, this paper investigates the joint optimization of IRS rotation angles to maximize the minimum expected signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) over all locations within a given target area. We first propose an angle-dependent channel model that accurately characterizes the reception and reflection of each IRS element. Different from the conventional cosine-law assumption, the proposed model captures the practical electromagnetic characteristics of the IRS, including the effective reception area and reflection efficiency. For the single target location case, a particle swarm optimization (PSO)-based algorithm is developed to solve the SNR maximization problem, and a closed-form expression for a near-optimal solution is derived to provide useful insights. For the general area coverage enhancement case, the optimal rotation is obtained through a two-loop PSO-based iterative algorithm with null-point detection. In this algorithm, the outer loop updates the global rotation angles to maximize the minimum SNR over the target area, whereas the inner loop evaluates the SNR distribution within the area to identify the location corresponding to the minimum SNR through null-point detection. Numerical results demonstrate significant SNR improvement achieved by the proposed rotatable IRS design over various benchmark schemes under different system setups.

Title: Efficient Verification and Falsification of ReLU Neural Barrier Certificates
Authors: Dejin Ren, Yiling Xue, Taoran Wu, Bai Xue
Abstract: Barrier certificates play an important role in verifying the safety of continuous-time systems, including autonomous driving, robotic manipulators and other critical applications. Recently, ReLU neural barrier certificates -- barrier certificates represented by the ReLU neural networks -- have attracted significant attention in the safe control community due to their promising performance. However, because of the approximate nature of neural networks, rigorous verification methods are required to ensure the correctness of these certificates. This paper presents a necessary and sufficient condition for verifying the correctness of ReLU neural barrier certificates. The proposed condition can be encoded as either an Satisfiability Modulo Theories (SMT) or optimization problem, enabling both verification and falsification. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach capable of falsifying ReLU neural barrier certificates. Numerical experiments demonstrate the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in both verifying and falsifying such certificates.

Title: Bridging the Initialization Gap: A Co-Optimization Framework for Mixed-Size Global Placement
Authors: Yuhao Ren, Yiting Liu, Yanfei Zhou, Zhiyu Zheng, Li Shang, Fan Yang, Zhiang Wang
Abstract: Global placement is a critical step with high computational complexity in VLSI physical design. Modern analytical placers formulate the placement problem as a nonlinear optimization, where initialization strongly affects both convergence behavior and final placement quality. However, existing initialization methods exhibit a trade-off: area-aware initializers account for cell areas but are computationally expensive and can dominate total runtime, while fast point-based initializers ignore cell area, leading to a modeling gap that impairs convergence and solution quality. We propose a lightweight co-optimization framework that bridges this initialization gap through two strategies. First, an area-hint refinement initializer incorporates heuristic cell area information into a signed graph signal by augmenting the netlist graph with virtual nodes and negative-weight edges, yielding an area-aware and spectrally smooth placement initialization. Second, a macro-schedule placement procedure progressively restores area constraints, enabling a smooth transition from the refined initializer to the full area-aware objective and producing high-quality placement results. We evaluate the framework on macro-heavy ISPD2005 academic benchmarks and two real-world industrial designs across two technology nodes (12 cases in total). Experimental results show that our method consistently improves half-perimeter wirelength (HPWL) over point-based initializers in 11 out of 12 cases, achieving up to 2.2% HPWL reduction, while running approximately 100 times faster than the state-of-the-art area-aware initializer.

Title: Cooperative Control of Hybrid FES-Exoskeleton: Dynamic Allocation
Authors: Hossein Kavianirad, Satoshi Endo, Davide Astarita, Lorenzo Amato, Emilio Trigili, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Hybrid assistive systems that integrate functional electrical stimulation (FES) and robotic exoskeletons offer a promising approach for neurorehabilitation. However, control of these systems remains challenging due to actuator redundancy and heterogeneous assistive device constraints. This paper introduces a novel cooperative control architecture based on dynamic allocation to address actuator redundancy in a hybrid FES-exoskeleton system. The proposed approach employs a modular control allocator that redistributes required control torques between FES and exoskeleton actuators in real time, accounting for device-specific limitations and user preferences (e.g., prioritizing one assistive device over another). Within this framework, the high-level controller determines the total assistance level, while the allocator dynamically distributes control effort based on these assistive device-specific considerations. Simulation results and experimental validation demonstrate the method's effectiveness in resolving actuator redundancy in the FES-exoskeleton system while reflecting actuator constraints, indicating its potential for deployment in clinical studies to assess patient acceptance and clinical efficacy.

Title: Consensus approximation and impulsive control for a class of uncertain multi-agent dynamics
Authors: Zoltan Nagy, Irinel-Constantin Morarescu, Lucian Busoniu
Abstract: This paper studies a class of consensus dynamics where the interactions between agents are affected by a time-varying unknown scaling factor. This situation is encountered in the control of robotic fleets over a wireless network or in opinion dynamics where the confidence given to the peers varies in time. Firstly, we establish conditions under which practical upper and lower bounds on the consensus value can be determined. Secondly, we propose control strategies for allocating a given control budget to shift agent states towards a desired consensus value despite the uncertainty. We provide computationally efficient linear programming-based approaches for both problems and validate the obtained results in numerical simulations.

Title: Closed Form Modelling and Identification of Banking Effects in Confined Waters
Authors: Jeppe H. Mikkelsen, Thomas T. Enevoldsen, Bugge T. Jensen, Michael Jeppesen, Roberto Galeazzi, Dimitrios Papageorgiou
Abstract: Vessels navigating in confined waters are subject to banking effects, which are hydrodynamic forces and moments arising from pressure differentials between the vessel sides, significantly affecting manoeuvrability and safety. Existing numerical approaches such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) can accurately capture these effects but are computationally expensive and unsuitable for real-time control or estimation. This paper presents a closed-form, first-principles model of banking effects. The model coefficients are identified using physics-informed regression on towing tank experiment data for a scaled container vessel. Validation through Shapley value analysis confirms the significance of the banking terms in reproducing the measured forces and moments. Lastly, the derived coefficients are shown to be non-dimensional, making the model applicable across different scales that preserve vessel geometry.

Title: A Study of Binaural Deep Beamforming With Interpretable Beampatterns Guided by Time-Varying RTF
Authors: Ilai Zaidel, Sharon Gannot
Abstract: In this work, a deep beamforming framework for speech enhancement in dynamic acoustic environments is studied. The time-varying beamformer weights are estimated from the noisy multichannel signals by minimizing an SI-SDR loss. The estimation is guided by the continuously tracked relative transfer functions (RTFs) of the moving target speaker. The spatial behavior of the network is evaluated through both narrowband and wideband beampatterns under three settings: (i) oracle guidance using true RTFs, (ii) estimated RTFs obtained by a subspace tracking method, and (iii) without the RTF guidance. Results show that RTF-guided models produce smoother, spatially consistent beampatterns that accurately track the target's direction of arrival. In contrast, the model fails to maintain a clear spatial focus when guidance is absent. Using the estimated RTFs as guidance closely matches the oracle RTF behavior, confirming the effectiveness of the tracking scheme. The model also outputs a binaural signal to preserve the speaker's spatial cues, which promotes hearing aid and hearables applications.

Title: Equivalent Mechanical Models for Sloshing
Authors: Francesco Capolupo
Abstract: Propellant sloshing is a well-known, but not completely mastered phenomenon in space vehicles. It is particularly critical in both microgravity environments - such as interplanetary spacecraft requiring high pointing stability - and high-g conditions, as encountered during launch, re-entry, and landing. In both cases, sloshing can significantly affect vehicle performance and stability, and must often be explicitly considered in the design of the guidance, navigation, and control (GNC) subsystem. For stability analysis and control design, the most common approach to modeling sloshing is through an equivalent mechanical representation, where the moving propellant is treated as a mechanical system interacting with the rigid (or flexible) spacecraft. Pendulum-based models and mass-spring-damper systems are widely used by control analysts to assess sloshing-induced perturbations on vehicles subjected to persistent non-gravitational acceleration along one of their body axes. In this work, we present a rigorous mathematical formulation of pendulum dynamics, starting from a single spherical pendulum attached to a rigid spacecraft. We derive the nonlinear equations of motion for this 8-degree-of-freedom multi-body system, and then extend the formulation to include multiple pendulums, representing multiple sloshing modes within a tank and/or multiple tanks on the same vehicle. Furthermore, we derive the corresponding linearized equations of motion, explicitly accounting for a nominal longitudinal force acting on the vehicle - consistent with the high-g sloshing regime - expressed in either the inertial or body frame. Finally, we demonstrate the mathematical equivalence between the pendulum and mass-spring-damper models and validate the proposed models through time-domain simulation and frequency-domain analysis.

Title: NOMA-Enabled Dual-IRS Relay Network Integrated with Ambient Backscatter Communication
Authors: Chandrima Thakur, Priyanka Ghosh, Rashmita Badhai, Sumit Kundu
Abstract: This paper analyzes a NOMA-enabled dual-Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS) relay network integrated with Ambient Backscatter (BS) communication. The system comprises a source, an energy-constrained relay with energy harvesting (EH) and BS capabilities, two NOMA users, and a BS node. The relay adopts a time-switching relaying (TSR) protocol to harvest energy and forward information ,while simultaneously enabling BS-based communication. Two IRS are deployed to enhance the S to R and R to (D1, D2) links under blockage conditions. Closed-form expressions for the Outage Probability (OP) and Throughput of both the main communication links and the BS-assisted secondary links are derived. Furthermore, throughput is analyzed under varying system parameters, including power allocation factors, reflection efficiency, IRS elements, and transmission rate. Monte Carlo simulations validate the analytical results. numerical findings reveal critical trade-offs between the main and RS links. The proposed framework provides useful insights for designing reliable and energy-efficient NOMA-IRS-aided BS networks for future IoT applications.

Title: Generalized Intelligence for Tactical Decision-Making: Large Language Model-Driven Dynamic Weapon Target Assignment
Authors: Johannes Autenrieb, Ole Ostermann
Abstract: Modern aerospace defense systems increasingly rely on autonomous decision-making to coordinate large numbers of interceptors against multiple incoming threats. Conventional weapon-target assignment (WTA) algorithms, including mixed-integer programming and auction-based methods, show limitations in dynamic and uncertain tactical environments where human-like reasoning and adaptive prioritization are required. This paper introduces a large language model (LLM) driven WTA framework that integrates generalized intelligence into cooperative missile guidance. The proposed system formulates the tactical decision process as a reasoning problem, in which an LLM evaluates spatial and temporal relationships among interceptors, targets, and defended assets to generate real-time assignments. In contrast to classical optimization methods, the approach leverages contextual mission data such as threat direction, asset priority, and closing velocity to adapt dynamically and reduce assignment switching. A dedicated simulation environment supports both static and dynamic assignment modes. Results demonstrate improved consistency, adaptability, and mission-level prioritization, establishing a foundation for integrating generalized artificial intelligence into tactical guidance systems.

Title: Music Flamingo: Scaling Music Understanding in Audio Language Models
Authors: Sreyan Ghosh, Arushi Goel, Lasha Koroshinadze, Sang-gil Lee, Zhifeng Kong, Joao Felipe Santos, Ramani Duraiswami, Dinesh Manocha, Wei Ping, Mohammad Shoeybi, Bryan Catanzaro
Abstract: We introduce Music Flamingo, a novel large audio-language model designed to advance music (including song) understanding in foundational audio models. While audio-language research has progressed rapidly, music remains challenging due to its dynamic, layered, and information-dense nature. Progress has been further limited by the difficulty of scaling open audio understanding models, primarily because of the scarcity of high-quality music data and annotations. As a result, prior models are restricted to producing short, high-level captions, answering only surface-level questions, and showing limited generalization across diverse musical cultures. To address these challenges, we curate MF-Skills, a large-scale dataset labeled through a multi-stage pipeline that yields rich captions and question-answer pairs covering harmony, structure, timbre, lyrics, and cultural context. We fine-tune an enhanced Audio Flamingo 3 backbone on MF-Skills and further strengthen multiple skills relevant to music understanding. To improve the model's reasoning abilities, we introduce a post-training recipe: we first cold-start with MF-Think, a novel chain-of-thought dataset grounded in music theory, followed by GRPO-based reinforcement learning with custom rewards. Music Flamingo achieves state-of-the-art results across 10+ benchmarks for music understanding and reasoning, establishing itself as a generalist and musically intelligent audio-language model. Beyond strong empirical results, Music Flamingo sets a new standard for advanced music understanding by demonstrating how models can move from surface-level recognition toward layered, human-like perception of songs. We believe this work provides both a benchmark and a foundation for the community to build the next generation of models that engage with music as meaningfully as humans do.

Title: Fault Detection in Solar Thermal Systems using Probabilistic Reconstructions
Authors: Florian Ebmeier, Nicole Ludwig, Jannik Thuemmel, Georg Martius, Volker H. Franz
Abstract: Solar thermal systems (STS) present a promising avenue for low-carbon heat generation, with a well-running system providing heat at minimal cost and carbon emissions. However, STS can exhibit faults due to improper installation, maintenance, or operation, often resulting in a substantial reduction in efficiency or even damage to the system. As monitoring at the individual level is economically prohibitive for small-scale systems, automated monitoring and fault detection should be used to address such issues. Recent advances in data-driven anomaly detection, particularly in time series analysis, offer a cost-effective solution by leveraging existing sensors to identify abnormal system states. Here, we propose a probabilistic reconstruction-based framework for anomaly detection. We evaluate our method on the publicly available PaSTS dataset of operational domestic STS, which features real-world complexities and diverse fault types. Our experiments show that reconstruction-based methods can detect faults in domestic STS both qualitatively and quantitatively, while generalizing to previously unseen systems. We also demonstrate that our model outperforms both simple and more complex deep learning baselines. Additionally, we show that heteroscedastic uncertainty estimation is essential to fault detection performance. Finally, we discuss the engineering overhead required to unlock these improvements and make a case for simple deep learning models.

Title: Semantic Communication with Hopfield Memories
Authors: Karim Nasreddine, Christo Kurisummoottil Thomas, Walid Saad
Abstract: Traditional joint source-channel coding employs static learned semantic representations that cannot dynamically adapt to evolving source distributions. Shared semantic memories between transmitter and receiver can potentially enable bandwidth savings by reusing previously transmitted concepts as context to reconstruct data, but require effective mechanisms to determine when current content is similar enough to stored patterns. However, existing hard quantization approaches based on variational autoencoders are limited by frequent memory updates even under small changes in data dynamics, which leads to inefficient usage of this http URL address this challenge, in this paper, a memory-augmented semantic communication framework is proposed where both transmitter and receiver maintain a shared memory of semantic concepts using modern Hopfield networks (MHNs). The proposed framework employs soft attention-based retrieval that smoothly adjusts stored semantic prototype weights as data evolves that enables stable matching decisions under gradual data dynamics. A joint optimization of encoder, decoder, and memory retrieval mechanism is performed with the objective of maximizing a reasoning capacity metric that quantifies semantic efficiency as the product of memory reuse rate and compression ratio. Theoretical analysis establishes the fundamental rate-distortion-reuse tradeoff and proves that soft retrieval reduces unnecessary transmissions compared to hard quantization under bounded semantic drift. Extensive simulations over diverse video scenarios demonstrate that the proposed MHN-based approach achieves substantial bit reductions around 14% on average and up to 70% in scenarios with gradual content changes compared to baseline.

Title: Security-Constrained AC/DC Grid Optimal Power Flow Considering Asymmetrical HVDC Grid Operation using Sparse Tableau Formulation
Authors: Oscar Damanik, Giacomo Bastianel, Dirk Van Hertem, Hakan Ergun
Abstract: This paper presents a security-constrained optimal power flow (SCOPF) model for HVDC grids that optimizes the asymmetrical operation of bipolar converter stations, i.e., different current injections of the positive and negative converter poles, to minimize operational costs under post-contingency conditions caused by single converter pole outages. The optimization model allows the selection of the number of converter stations that operate asymmetrically. The results indicate that increasing the number of asymmetrical stations lowers operational costs. The analysis also provides insight into the sensitivity of these costs to the level of asymmetrical operation. However, increased asymmetrical operation leads to higher DC neutral voltage offsets that can rise to undesired levels. Imposing limits on these offsets can, in turn, increase operational costs. To mitigate these effects, a neutral line switching (NLS) strategy is proposed for the post-contingency state.

Title: Equivariant Denoisers for Plug and Play Image Restoration
Authors: Marien Renaud, Eliot Guez, Arthur Leclaire, Nicolas Papadakis
Abstract: One key ingredient of image restoration is to define a realistic prior on clean images to complete the missing information in the observation. State-of-the-art restoration methods rely on a neural network to encode this prior. Typical image distributions are invariant to some set of transformations, such as rotations or flips. However, most deep architectures are not designed to represent an invariant image distribution. Recent works have proposed to overcome this difficulty by including equivariance properties within a Plug-and-Play paradigm. In this work, we propose two unified frameworks named Equivariant Regularization by Denoising (ERED) and Equivariant Plug-and-Play (EPnP) based on equivariant denoisers and stochastic optimization. We analyze the convergence of the proposed algorithms and discuss their practical benefit.

Title: Large-Signal Stability Guarantees for a Scalable DC Microgrid with Nonlinear Distributed Control: The Slow Communication Scenario
Authors: Cornelia Skaga, Mahdieh S. Sadabadi, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources into electrical grids necessitates a paradigm shift toward advanced control schemes that guarantee safe and stable operations with scalable properties. Hence, this study explores large-signal stability guarantees of a promising distributed control framework for cyber-physical DC microgrids, ensuring proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. The proposed control framework adopts nonlinear nested control loops--inner (decentralized) and outer (distributed)--specifically designed to simultaneously achieve the control objectives. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the nested control loops. In particular, by saturating the influence of the outer loop controller in the inner loop, the proposed controller preserves a more convenient mathematical structure, facilitating the scalability of the stability proof using Lyapunov arguments. The effectiveness of our proposed control strategy is supported through time-domain simulations of a case-specific low-voltage DC microgrid following a careful tuning strategy, and a small-signal stability analysis is conducted to derive practical guidelines that enhance the applicability of the method.

Title: Stability Analysis of a Nonlinear Distributed Control Framework for Current Sharing and Voltage Containment in DC Microgrids: The Fast Communication Scenario
Authors: Cornelia Skaga, Babak Abdolmaleki, Gilbert Bergna-Diaz
Abstract: As renewable energy generation becomes increasingly integrated into electrical grids, there is a critical need for a paradigm shift toward control schemes that ensure safe, stable, and scalable operations. Hence, in this study, we explore the stability guarantees of a promising control proposal for cyber-physical DC microgrids (MGs), specifically designed to simultaneously achieve proportional current sharing and voltage containment within pre-specified limits. Our scalable stability result relies on singular perturbation theory to prove global exponential stability by imposing a sufficient time-scale separation at the border between the inner(decentralized) and outer(distributed) nested loops, and thus, ensuring that the system reaches the desired (optimal) steady state under appropriate tuning verifying some stability conditions. To prove the effectiveness of our method, our findings are supported by testing the control method in a time-domain simulation case study involving a low-voltage DC microgrid, as well as a small-signal stability analysis

Title: Domain Adaptation for Camera-Specific Image Characteristics using Shallow Discriminators
Authors: Maximiliane Gruber, Jürgen Seiler, André Kaup
Abstract: Each image acquisition setup leads to its own camera-specific image characteristics degrading the image quality. In learning-based perception algorithms, characteristics occurring during the application phase, but absent in the training data, lead to a domain gap impeding the performance. Previously, pixel-level domain adaptation through unpaired learning of the pristine-to-distorted mapping function has been proposed. In this work, we propose shallow discriminator architectures to address limitations of these approaches. We show that a smaller receptive field size improves learning of unknown image distortions by more accurately reproducing local distortion characteristics at a low network complexity. In a domain adaptation setup for instance segmentation, we achieve mean average precision increases over previous methods of up to 0.15 for individual distortions and up to 0.16 for camera-specific image characteristics in a simplified camera model. In terms of number of parameters, our approach matches the complexity of one state of the art method while reducing complexity by a factor of 20 compared to another, demonstrating superior efficiency without compromising performance.

Title: A Decomposition Approach to Solving Numerical Constraint Satisfaction Problems on Directed Acyclic Graphs
Authors: Max Mowbray, Nilay Shah, Benoît Chachuat
Abstract: Certifying feasibility in decision-making, critical in many industries, can be framed as a constraint satisfaction problem. This paper focuses on characterising a subset of parameter values from an a priori set that satisfy constraints on a directed acyclic graph of constituent functions. The main assumption is that these functions and constraints may be evaluated for given parameter values, but they need not be known in closed form and could result from expensive or proprietary simulations. This setting lends itself to using sampling methods to gain an inner approximation of the feasible domain. To mitigate the curse of dimensionality, the paper contributes new methodology to leverage the graph structure for decomposing the problem into lower-dimensional subproblems defined on the respective nodes. The working hypothesis that the Cartesian product of the solution sets yielded by the subproblems will tighten the a priori parameter domain, before solving the full problem defined on the graph, is demonstrated through four case studies relevant to machine learning and engineering. Future research will extend this approach to cyclic graphs and account for parametric uncertainty.

Title: Formal Verification of Control Lyapunov-Barrier Functions for Safe Stabilization with Bounded Controls
Authors: Jun Liu
Abstract: We present verifiable conditions for synthesizing a single smooth Lyapunov function that certifies both asymptotic stability and safety under bounded controls. These sufficient conditions ensure the strict compatibility of a control barrier function (CBF) and a control Lyapunov function (CLF) on the exact safe set certified by the barrier. An explicit smooth control Lyapunov-barrier function (CLBF) is then constructed via a patching formula that is provably correct by design. Two examples illustrate the computational procedure, showing that the proposed approach is less conservative than sum-of-squares (SOS)-based compatible CBF-CLF designs.

Title: Evaluation of Grid-based Uncertainty Propagation for Collaborative Self-Calibration in Indoor Positioning Systems
Authors: Andrea Jung, Paul Schwarzbach, Oliver Michler
Abstract: Radio-based localization systems conventionally require stationary reference points (e.g. anchors) with precisely surveyed positions, making deployment time-consuming and costly. This paper presents an empirical evaluation of collaborative self-calibration for Ultra-Wideband (UWB) networks, extending a discrete Bayesian approach based on grid-based uncertainty propagation. The enhanced algorithm reduces measurement availability requirements while maintaining positioning accuracy through probabilistic state estimation. We validate the approach using real-world data from controlled indoor UWB network experiments with 12 nodes in a static environment. Experimental evaluation demonstrates 0.28~m mean ranging error under line-of-sight conditions and 1.11~m overall ranging error across mixed propagation scenarios, achieving sub-meter positioning accuracy. Results demonstrate the algorithm's robustness to measurement noise and partial connectivity scenarios typical in industrial deployments. The findings contribute to automated UWB network initialization for indoor positioning applications, reducing infrastructure dependency compared to manual anchor calibration procedures.

Title: Safe Planning in Interactive Environments via Iterative Policy Updates and Adversarially Robust Conformal Prediction
Authors: Omid Mirzaeedodangeh, Eliot Shekhtman, Nikolai Matni, Lars Lindemann
Abstract: Safe planning of an autonomous agent in interactive environments -- such as the control of a self-driving vehicle among pedestrians and human-controlled vehicles -- poses a major challenge as the behavior of the environment is unknown and reactive to the behavior of the autonomous agent. This coupling gives rise to interaction-driven distribution shifts where the autonomous agent's control policy may change the environment's behavior, thereby invalidating safety guarantees in existing work. Indeed, recent works have used conformal prediction (CP) to generate distribution-free safety guarantees using observed data of the environment. However, CP's assumption on data exchangeability is violated in interactive settings due to a circular dependency where a control policy update changes the environment's behavior, and vice versa. To address this gap, we propose an iterative framework that robustly maintains safety guarantees across policy updates by quantifying the potential impact of a planned policy update on the environment's behavior. We realize this via adversarially robust CP where we perform a regular CP step in each episode using observed data under the current policy, but then transfer safety guarantees across policy updates by analytically adjusting the CP result to account for distribution shifts. This adjustment is performed based on a policy-to-trajectory sensitivity analysis, resulting in a safe, episodic open-loop planner. We further conduct a contraction analysis of the system providing conditions under which both the CP results and the policy updates are guaranteed to converge. We empirically demonstrate these safety and convergence guarantees on a two-dimensional car-pedestrian case study. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first results that provide valid safety guarantees in such interactive settings.

Title: The Resonance Principle: Empirical Evidence for Emergent Phase Synchronization in Human Causal Reasoning
Authors: Ahmed Gamal Eldin
Abstract: Current artificial intelligence systems excel at correlational pattern matching but fail to achieve genuine causal understanding, a limitation often described as the "Kepler versus Newton" problem. We argue that this limitation is inherent to deterministic digital architectures. We introduce the Resonance Principle, a theoretical framework proposing that causal understanding emerges only in stochastic, bounded agents with intrinsic cost functions. The agent's substrate is modeled as a network of weakly coupled oscillators, where action proposals arise as stable resonant modes excited by intrinsic noise. We hypothesize that the brain, a stochastic and resonant system, operates according to this principle. To test this, we analyzed high-density EEG data (25 recordings, 500 trials) from a P300 BCI task. We computed the Kuramoto Order Parameter (R) to measure global phase synchronization (resonance) and compared it to the Event-Related Potential (ERP) voltage. Global resonance and voltage were statistically uncorrelated (r = 0.048), yet trial-level analysis revealed a strong correlation (r = 0.590, p < 0.0001). This suggests that resonance is a hidden mechanism coordinating neural firing, giving rise to measurable ERPs. We conclude that phase synchronization is not a byproduct but a fundamental signature of emergent causal understanding.

Title: Direction-of-Arrival and Noise Covariance Matrix joint estimation for beamforming
Authors: Vitor Gelsleichter Probst Curtarelli
Abstract: We propose a joint estimation method for the Direction-of-Arrival (DoA) and the Noise Covariance Matrix (NCM) tailored for beamforming applications. Building upon an existing NCM framework, our approach simplifies the estimation procedure by deriving an quasi-linear solution, instead of the traditional exhaustive search. Additionally, we introduce a novel DoA estimation technique that operates across all frequency bins, improving robustness in reverberant environments. Simulation results demonstrate that our method outperforms classical techniques, such as MUSIC, in mid- to high-angle scenarios, achieving lower angular errors and superior signal enhancement through beamforming. The proposed framework was also fared against other techniques for signal enhancement, having better noise rejection and interference canceling capabilities. These improvements are validated using both theoretical and empirical performance metrics.

Title: Filtering Jump Markov Systems with Partially Known Dynamics: A Model-Based Deep Learning Approach
Authors: George Stamatelis, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper presents the Jump Markov Filtering Network (JMFNet), a novel model-based deep learning framework for real-time state-state estimation in jump Markov systems with unknown noise statistics and mode transition dynamics. A hybrid architecture comprising two Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) is proposed: one for mode prediction and another for filtering that is based on a mode-augmented version of the recently presented KalmanNet architecture. The proposed RNNs are trained jointly using an alternating least squares strategy that enables mutual adaptation without supervision of the latent modes. Extensive numerical experiments on linear and nonlinear systems, including target tracking, pendulum angle tracking, Lorenz attractor dynamics, and a real-life dataset demonstrate that the proposed JMFNet framework outperforms classical model-based filters (e.g., interacting multiple models and particle filters) as well as model-free deep learning baselines, particularly in non-stationary and high-noise regimes. It is also showcased that JMFNet achieves a small yet meaningful improvement over the KalmanNet framework, which becomes much more pronounced in complicated systems or long trajectories. Finally, the method's performance is empirically validated to be consistent and reliable, exhibiting low sensitivity to initial conditions, hyperparameter selection, as well as to incorrect model knowledge

Title: HAMscope: a snapshot Hyperspectral Autofluorescence Miniscope for real-time molecular imaging
Authors: Alexander Ingold, Richard G. Baird, Dasmeet Kaur, Nidhi Dwivedi, Reed Sorenson, Leslie Sieburth, Chang-Jun Liu, Rajesh Menon
Abstract: We introduce HAMscope, a compact, snapshot hyperspectral autofluorescence miniscope that enables real-time, label-free molecular imaging in a wide range of biological systems. By integrating a thin polymer diffuser into a widefield miniscope, HAMscope spectrally encodes each frame and employs a probabilistic deep learning framework to reconstruct 30-channel hyperspectral stacks (452 to 703 nm) or directly infer molecular composition maps from single images. A scalable multi-pass U-Net architecture with transformer-based attention and per-pixel uncertainty estimation enables high spatio-spectral fidelity (mean absolute error ~ 0.0048) at video rates. While initially demonstrated in plant systems, including lignin, chlorophyll, and suberin imaging in intact poplar and cork tissues, the platform is readily adaptable to other applications such as neural activity mapping, metabolic profiling, and histopathology. We show that the system generalizes to out-of-distribution tissue types and supports direct molecular mapping without the need for spectral unmixing. HAMscope establishes a general framework for compact, uncertainty-aware spectral imaging that combines minimal optics with advanced deep learning, offering broad utility for real-time biochemical imaging across neuroscience, environmental monitoring, and biomedicine.

Title: Systematic validation of time-resolved diffuse optical simulators via non-contact SPAD-based measurements
Authors: Weijia Zhao, Linlin Li, Kaiqi Kuang, Lin Yang, Claudio Bruschini, Jiaming Cao, Edoardo Charbon, Wuwei Ren
Abstract: Objective: Time-domain diffuse optical imaging (DOI) requires accurate forward models for photon propagation in scattering media. However, existing simulators lack comprehensive experimental validation, especially for non-contact configurations with oblique illumination. This study rigorously evaluates three widely used open-source simulators, including MMC, NIRFASTer, and Toast++, using time-resolved experimental data. Approach: All simulations employed a unified mesh and point-source illumination. Virtual source correction was applied to FEM solvers for oblique incidence. A time-resolved DOI system with a 32 $\times$ 32 single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array acquired transmission-mode data from 16 standardized phantoms with varying absorption coefficient $\mu_a$ and reduced scattering coefficient $\mu_s'$. The simulation results were quantified across five metrics: spatial-domain (SD) precision, time-domain (TD) precision, oblique beam accuracy, computational speed, and mesh-density independence. Results: Among three simulators, MMC achieves superior accuracy in SD and TD metrics, and shows robustness across all optical properties. NIRFASTer and Toast++ demonstrate comparable overall performance. In general, MMC is optimal for accuracy-critical TD-DOI applications, while NIRFASTer and Toast++ suit scenarios prioritizing speed with sufficiently large $\mu_s'$. Besides, virtual source correction is essential for non-contact FEM modeling, which reduced average errors by > 34% in large-angle scenarios. Significance: This work provides benchmarked guidelines for simulator selection during the development phase of next-generation TD-DOI systems. Our work represents the first study to systematically validate TD simulators against SPAD array-based data under clinically relevant non-contact conditions, bridging a critical gap in biomedical optical simulation standards.

Abstract: We present the ongoing development of a robotic system for overhead work such as ceiling drilling. The hardware platform comprises a mobile base with a two-stage lift, on which a bimanual torso is mounted with a custom-designed drilling end effector and RGB-D cameras. To support teleoperation in dynamic environments with limited visibility, we use Gaussian splatting for online 3D reconstruction and introduce motion parameters to model moving objects. For safe operation around dynamic obstacles, we developed a neural configuration-space barrier approach for planning and control. Initial feasibility studies demonstrate the capability of the hardware in drilling, bolting, and anchoring, and the software in safe teleoperation in a dynamic environment.

Title: Brian Intensify: An Adaptive Machine Learning Framework for Auditory EEG Stimulation and Cognitive Enhancement in FXS
Authors: Zag ElSayed, Grace Westerkamp, Jack Yanchen Liu, Ernest Pedapati
Abstract: Neurodevelopmental disorders such as Fragile X Syndrome (FXS) and Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) are characterized by disrupted cortical oscillatory activity, particularly in the alpha and gamma frequency bands. These abnormalities are linked to deficits in attention, sensory processing, and cognitive function. In this work, we present an adaptive machine learning-based brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to modulate neural oscillations through frequency-specific auditory stimulation to enhance cognitive readiness in individuals with FXS. EEG data were recorded from 38 participants using a 128-channel system under a stimulation paradigm consisting of a 30-second baseline (no stimulus) followed by 60-second auditory entrainment episodes at 7Hz, 9Hz, 11Hz, and 13Hz. A comprehensive analysis of power spectral features (Alpha, Gamma, Delta, Theta, Beta) and cross-frequency coupling metrics (Alpha-Gamma, Alpha-Beta, etc.) was conducted. The results identified Peak Alpha Power, Peak Gamma Power, and Alpha Power per second per channel as the most discriminative biomarkers. The 13Hz stimulation condition consistently elicited a significant increase in Alpha activity and suppression of Gamma activity, aligning with our optimization objective. A supervised machine learning framework was developed to predict EEG responses and dynamically adjust stimulation parameters, enabling real-time, subject-specific adaptation. This work establishes a novel EEG-driven optimization framework for cognitive neuromodulation, providing a foundational model for next-generation AI-integrated BCI systems aimed at personalized neurorehabilitation in FXS and related disorders.

Title: Modelos Empiricos de Pos-Dupla Selecao por LASSO: Discussoes para Estudos do Transporte Aereo
Authors: Alessandro V. M. Oliveira
Abstract: This paper presents and discusses forms of estimation by regularized regression and model selection using the LASSO method - Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator. LASSO is recognized as one of the main supervised learning methods applied to high-dimensional econometrics, allowing work with large volumes of data and multiple correlated controls. Conceptual issues related to the consequences of high dimensionality in modern econometrics and the principle of sparsity, which underpins regularization procedures, are addressed. The study examines the main post-double selection and post-regularization models, including variations applied to instrumental variable models. A brief description of the lassopack routine package, its syntaxes, and examples of HD, HDS (High-Dimension Sparse), and IV-HDS models, with combinations involving fixed effects estimators, is also presented. Finally, the potential application of the approach in research focused on air transport is discussed, with emphasis on an empirical study on the operational efficiency of airlines and aircraft fuel consumption.

Title: NeuroLingua: A Language-Inspired Hierarchical Framework for Multimodal Sleep Stage Classification Using EEG and EOG
Authors: Mahdi Samaee, Mehran Yazdi, Daniel Massicotte
Abstract: Automated sleep stage classification from polysomnography remains limited by the lack of expressive temporal hierarchies, challenges in multimodal EEG and EOG fusion, and the limited interpretability of deep learning models. We propose NeuroLingua, a language-inspired framework that conceptualizes sleep as a structured physiological language. Each 30-second epoch is decomposed into overlapping 3-second subwindows ("tokens") using a CNN-based tokenizer, enabling hierarchical temporal modeling through dual-level Transformers: intra-segment encoding of local dependencies and inter-segment integration across seven consecutive epochs (3.5 minutes) for extended context. Modality-specific embeddings from EEG and EOG channels are fused via a Graph Convolutional Network, facilitating robust multimodal integration. NeuroLingua is evaluated on the Sleep-EDF Expanded and ISRUC-Sleep datasets, achieving state-of-the-art results on Sleep-EDF (85.3% accuracy, 0.800 macro F1, and 0.796 Cohen's kappa) and competitive performance on ISRUC (81.9% accuracy, 0.802 macro F1, and 0.755 kappa), matching or exceeding published baselines in overall and per-class metrics. The architecture's attention mechanisms enhance the detection of clinically relevant sleep microevents, providing a principled foundation for future interpretability, explainability, and causal inference in sleep research. By framing sleep as a compositional language, NeuroLingua unifies hierarchical sequence modeling and multimodal fusion, advancing automated sleep staging toward more transparent and clinically meaningful applications.

Title: A Robust Task-Level Control Architecture for Learned Dynamical Systems
Authors: Eshika Pathak, Ahmed Aboudonia, Sandeep Banik, Naira Hovakimyan
Abstract: Dynamical system (DS)-based learning from demonstration (LfD) is a powerful tool for generating motion plans in the operation (`task') space of robotic systems. However, the realization of the generated motion plans is often compromised by a ''task-execution mismatch'', where unmodeled dynamics, persistent disturbances, and system latency cause the robot's actual task-space state to diverge from the desired motion trajectory. We propose a novel task-level robust control architecture, L1-augmented Dynamical Systems (L1-DS), that explicitly handles the task-execution mismatch in tracking a nominal motion plan generated by any DS-based LfD scheme. Our framework augments any DS-based LfD model with a nominal stabilizing controller and an L1 adaptive controller. Furthermore, we introduce a windowed Dynamic Time Warping (DTW)-based target selector, which enables the nominal stabilizing controller to handle temporal misalignment for improved phase-consistent tracking. We demonstrate the efficacy of our architecture on the LASA and IROS handwriting datasets.

Title: PANDA - Patch And Distribution-Aware Augmentation for Long-Tailed Exemplar-Free Continual Learning
Authors: Siddeshwar Raghavan, Jiangpeng He, Fengqing Zhu
Abstract: Exemplar-Free Continual Learning (EFCL) restricts the storage of previous task data and is highly susceptible to catastrophic forgetting. While pre-trained models (PTMs) are increasingly leveraged for EFCL, existing methods often overlook the inherent imbalance of real-world data distributions. We discovered that real-world data streams commonly exhibit dual-level imbalances, dataset-level distributions combined with extreme or reversed skews within individual tasks, creating both intra-task and inter-task disparities that hinder effective learning and generalization. To address these challenges, we propose PANDA, a Patch-and-Distribution-Aware Augmentation framework that integrates seamlessly with existing PTM-based EFCL methods. PANDA amplifies low-frequency classes by using a CLIP encoder to identify representative regions and transplanting those into frequent-class samples within each task. Furthermore, PANDA incorporates an adaptive balancing strategy that leverages prior task distributions to smooth inter-task imbalances, reducing the overall gap between average samples across tasks and enabling fairer learning with frozen PTMs. Extensive experiments and ablation studies demonstrate PANDA's capability to work with existing PTM-based CL methods, improving accuracy and reducing catastrophic forgetting.

Title: On the Convergence of Overparameterized Problems: Inherent Properties of the Compositional Structure of Neural Networks
Authors: Arthur Castello Branco de Oliveira, Dhruv Jatkar, Eduardo Sontag
Abstract: This paper investigates how the compositional structure of neural networks shapes their optimization landscape and training dynamics. We analyze the gradient flow associated with overparameterized optimization problems, which can be interpreted as training a neural network with linear activations. Remarkably, we show that the global convergence properties can be derived for any cost function that is proper and real analytic. We then specialize the analysis to scalar-valued cost functions, where the geometry of the landscape can be fully characterized. In this setting, we demonstrate that key structural features -- such as the location and stability of saddle points -- are universal across all admissible costs, depending solely on the overparameterized representation rather than on problem-specific details. Moreover, we show that convergence can be arbitrarily accelerated depending on the initialization, as measured by an imbalance metric introduced in this work. Finally, we discuss how these insights may generalize to neural networks with sigmoidal activations, showing through a simple example which geometric and dynamical properties persist beyond the linear case.

Title: The Age-Structured Chemostat with Substrate Dynamics as a Control System
Authors: Iasson Karafyllis, Dionysis Theodosis, Miroslav Krstic
Abstract: In this work we study an age-structured chemostat model with a renewal boundary condition and a coupled substrate equation. The model is nonlinear and consists of a hyperbolic partial differential equation and an ordinary differential equation with nonlinear, nonlocal terms appearing both in the ordinary differential equation and the boundary condition. Both differential equations contain a non-negative control input, while the states of the model are required to be positive. Under an appropriate weak solution framework, we determine the state space and the input space for this model. We prove global existence and uniqueness of solutions for all admissible initial conditions and all allowable control inputs. To this purpose we employ a combination of Banach's fixed-point theorem with implicit solution formulas and useful solution estimates. Finally, we show that the age-structured chemostat model gives a well-defined control system on a metric space.

Title: VLF-MSC: Vision-Language Feature-Based Multimodal Semantic Communication System
Authors: Gwangyeon Ahn, Jiwan Seo, Joonhyuk Kang
Abstract: We propose Vision-Language Feature-based Multimodal Semantic Communication (VLF-MSC), a unified system that transmits a single compact vision-language representation to support both image and text generation at the receiver. Unlike existing semantic communication techniques that process each modality separately, VLF-MSC employs a pre-trained vision-language model (VLM) to encode the source image into a vision-language semantic feature (VLF), which is transmitted over the wireless channel. At the receiver, a decoder-based language model and a diffusion-based image generator are both conditioned on the VLF to produce a descriptive text and a semantically aligned image. This unified representation eliminates the need for modality-specific streams or retransmissions, improving spectral efficiency and adaptability. By leveraging foundation models, the system achieves robustness to channel noise while preserving semantic fidelity. Experiments demonstrate that VLF-MSC outperforms text-only and image-only baselines, achieving higher semantic accuracy for both modalities under low SNR with significantly reduced bandwidth.

Title: Robustness and Imperceptibility Analysis of Hybrid Spatial-Frequency Domain Image Watermarking
Authors: Rizal Khoirul Anam
Abstract: The proliferation of digital media necessitates robust methods for copyright protection and content authentication. This paper presents a comprehensive comparative study of digital image watermarking techniques implemented using the spatial domain (Least Significant Bit - LSB), the frequency domain (Discrete Fourier Transform - DFT), and a novel hybrid (LSB+DFT) approach. The core objective is to evaluate the trade-offs between imperceptibility (measured by Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio - PSNR) and robustness (measured by Normalized Correlation - NC and Bit Error Rate - BER). We implemented these three techniques within a unified MATLAB-based experimental framework. The watermarked images were subjected to a battery of common image processing attacks, including JPEG compression, Gaussian noise, and salt-and-pepper noise, at varying intensities. Experimental results generated from standard image datasets (USC-SIPI) demonstrate that while LSB provides superior imperceptibility, it is extremely fragile. The DFT method offers significant robustness at the cost of visual quality. The proposed hybrid LSB+DFT technique, which leverages redundant embedding and a fallback extraction mechanism, is shown to provide the optimal balance, maintaining high visual fidelity while exhibiting superior resilience to all tested attacks.

Title: MTR-DuplexBench: Towards a Comprehensive Evaluation of Multi-Round Conversations for Full-Duplex Speech Language Models
Authors: He Zhang, Wenqian Cui, Haoning Xu, Xiaohui Li, Lei Zhu, Shaohua Ma, Irwin King
Abstract: Full-Duplex Speech Language Models (FD-SLMs) enable real-time, overlapping conversational interactions, offering a more dynamic user experience compared to traditional half-duplex models. However, existing benchmarks primarily focus on evaluating single-round interactions and conversational features, neglecting the complexities of multi-round communication and critical capabilities such as instruction following and safety. Evaluating FD-SLMs in multi-round settings poses significant challenges, including blurred turn boundaries in communication and context inconsistency during model inference. To address these gaps, we introduce MTR-DuplexBench, a novel benchmark that segments continuous full-duplex dialogues into discrete turns, enabling comprehensive, turn-by-turn evaluation of FD-SLMs across dialogue quality, conversational dynamics, instruction following, and safety. Experimental results reveal that current FD-SLMs face difficulties in maintaining consistent performance across multiple rounds and evaluation dimensions, highlighting the necessity and effectiveness of our proposed benchmark. The benchmark and code will be available in the future.

Title: Reconfigurable Airspace: Synergizing Movable Antenna and Intelligent Surface for Low-Altitude ISAC Networks
Authors: Honghao Wang, Qingqing Wu, Yifan Jiang, Ziyuan Zheng, Ziheng Zhang, Yanze Zhu, Ying Gao, Wen Chen, Guanghai Liu, Abbas Jamalipour
Abstract: Low-altitude unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) networks are integral to future 6G integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. However, their deployment is hindered by challenges stemming from high mobility of UAVs, complex propagation environments, and the inherent trade-offs between coexisting sensing and communication functions. This article proposes a novel framework that leverages movable antennas (MAs) and intelligent reflecting surfaces (IRSs) as dual enablers to overcome these limitations. MAs, through active transceiver reconfiguration, and IRSs, via passive channel reconstruction, can work in synergy to significantly enhance system performance. Our analysis first elaborates on the fundamental gains offered by MAs and IRSs, and provides simulation results that validate the immense potential of the MA-IRS-enabled ISAC architecture. Two core UAV deployment scenarios are then investigated: (i) UAVs as ISAC users, where we focus on achieving high-precision tracking and aerial safety, and (ii) UAVs as aerial network nodes, where we address robust design and complex coupled resource optimization. Finally, key technical challenges and research opportunities are identified and analyzed for each scenario, charting a clear course for the future design of advanced low-altitude ISAC networks.

Title: Gradient Flow Equations for Deep Linear Neural Networks: A Survey from a Network Perspective
Authors: Joel Wendin, Claudio Altafini
Abstract: The paper surveys recent progresses in understanding the dynamics and loss landscape of the gradient flow equations associated to deep linear neural networks, i.e., the gradient descent training dynamics (in the limit when the step size goes to 0) of deep neural networks missing the activation functions and subject to quadratic loss functions. When formulated in terms of the adjacency matrix of the neural network, as we do in the paper, these gradient flow equations form a class of converging matrix ODEs which is nilpotent, polynomial, isospectral, and with conservation laws. The loss landscape is described in detail. It is characterized by infinitely many global minima and saddle points, both strict and nonstrict, but lacks local minima and maxima. The loss function itself is a positive semidefinite Lyapunov function for the gradient flow, and its level sets are unbounded invariant sets of critical points, with critical values that correspond to the amount of singular values of the input-output data learnt by the gradient along a certain trajectory. The adjacency matrix representation we use in the paper allows to highlight the existence of a quotient space structure in which each critical value of the loss function is represented only once, while all other critical points with the same critical value belong to the fiber associated to the quotient space. It also allows to easily determine stable and unstable submanifolds at the saddle points, even when the Hessian fails to obtain them.

Title: Operator Models for Continuous-Time Offline Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Nicolas Hoischen, Petar Bevanda, Max Beier, Stefan Sosnowski, Boris Houska, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Continuous-time stochastic processes underlie many natural and engineered systems. In healthcare, autonomous driving, and industrial control, direct interaction with the environment is often unsafe or impractical, motivating offline reinforcement learning from historical data. However, there is limited statistical understanding of the approximation errors inherent in learning policies from offline datasets. We address this by linking reinforcement learning to the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation and proposing an operator-theoretic algorithm based on a simple dynamic programming recursion. Specifically, we represent our world model in terms of the infinitesimal generator of controlled diffusion processes learned in a reproducing kernel Hilbert space. By integrating statistical learning methods and operator theory, we establish global convergence of the value function and derive finite-sample guarantees with bounds tied to system properties such as smoothness and stability. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that operator-based approaches may hold promise in solving offline reinforcement learning using continuous-time optimal control.

Title: On topological properties of closed attractors
Authors: Wouter Jongeneel
Abstract: The notion of an attractor has various definitions in the theory of dynamical systems. Under compactness assumptions, several of those definitions coincide and the theory is rather complete. However, without compactness, the picture becomes blurry. To improve our understanding, we characterize in this work when a closed, not necessarily compact, asymptotically stable attractor on a locally compact metric space is homotopy equivalent to its domain of attraction. This enables a further structural study of the corresponding feedback stabilization problem.

Title: Motivations and Actions of Human-Building Interactions from Environmental Momentary Assessments
Authors: Maharshi Pathak, SungKu Kang, Vanessa C. Whittem, Katherine Bassett, Michael B. Kane, David J. Fannon
Abstract: The expansion of renewable electricity generation, growing demands due to electrification, greater prevalence of working from home, and increasing frequency and severity of extreme weather events, will place new demands on the electric supply and distribution grid. Broader adoption of demand response programs (DRPs) for the residential sector may help meet these challenges; however, experience shows that occupant overrides in DRPs compromises their effectiveness. There is a lack of formal understanding of how discomfort, routines, and other motivations affect DRP overrides and other related human building interactions (HBI). This paper reports preliminary findings from a study of 20 households in Colorado and Massachusetts, US over three months. Participants responded to ecological momentary assessments (EMA) triggered by thermostat interactions and at random times throughout the day. EMAs included Likert-scale questions of thermal preference, preference intensity, and changes to 7 different activity types that could affect thermal comfort, and an opened ended question about motivations of such actions. Twelve tags were developed to categorize motivation responses and analyzed statistically to identify associations between motivations, preferences, and HBI actions. Reactions to changes in the thermal environment were the most frequently observed motivation, 118 of 220 responses. On the other hand, 47% responses were at least partially motivated by non-thermal factors, suggesting limited utility for occupant behavior models founded solely on thermal comfort. Changes in activity level and clothing were less likely to be reported when EMAs were triggered by thermostat interactions, while fan interactions were more likely. Windows, shades, and portable heater interactions had no significant dependence on how the EMA was triggered.

Title: SPOT: Sparsification with Attention Dynamics via Token Relevance in Vision Transformers
Authors: Oded Schlesinger, Amirhossein Farzam, J. Matias Di Martino, Guillermo Sapiro
Abstract: While Vision Transformers (ViT) have demonstrated remarkable performance across diverse tasks, their computational demands are substantial, scaling quadratically with the number of processed tokens. Compact attention representations, reflecting token interaction distributions, can guide early detection and reduction of less salient tokens prior to attention computation. Motivated by this, we present SParsification with attentiOn dynamics via Token relevance (SPOT), a framework for early detection of redundant tokens within ViTs that leverages token embeddings, interactions, and attention dynamics across layers to infer token importance, resulting in a more context-aware and interpretable relevance detection process. SPOT informs token sparsification and facilitates the elimination of such tokens, improving computational efficiency without sacrificing performance. SPOT employs computationally lightweight predictors that can be plugged into various ViT architectures and learn to derive effective input-specific token prioritization across layers. Its versatile design supports a range of performance levels adaptable to varying resource constraints. Empirical evaluations demonstrate significant efficiency gains of up to 40% compared to standard ViTs, while maintaining or even improving accuracy. Code and models are available at this https URL .

Title: Belief Net: A Filter-Based Framework for Learning Hidden Markov Models from Observations
Authors: Reginald Zhiyan Chen, Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) are fundamental for modeling sequential data, yet learning their parameters from observations remains challenging. Classical methods like the Baum-Welch (EM) algorithm are computationally intensive and prone to local optima, while modern spectral algorithms offer provable guarantees but may produce probability outputs outside valid ranges. This work introduces Belief Net, a novel framework that learns HMM parameters through gradient-based optimization by formulating the HMM's forward filter as a structured neural network. Unlike black-box Transformer models, Belief Net's learnable weights are explicitly the logits of the initial distribution, transition matrix, and emission matrix, ensuring full interpretability. The model processes observation sequences using a decoder-only architecture and is trained end-to-end with standard autoregressive next-observation prediction loss. On synthetic HMM data, Belief Net achieves superior convergence speed compared to Baum-Welch, successfully recovering parameters in both undercomplete and overcomplete settings where spectral methods fail. Comparisons with Transformer-based models are also presented on real-world language data.

Title: Optimizing the flight path for a scouting Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle
Authors: Raghav Adhikari, Sachet Khatiwada, Suman Poudel
Abstract: Post-disaster situations pose unique navigation challenges. One of those challenges is the unstructured nature of the environment, which makes it hard to layout paths for rescue vehicles. We propose the use of Uncrewed Aerial Vehicle (UAV) in such scenario to perform reconnaissance across the environment. To accomplish this, we propose an optimization-based approach to plan a path for the UAV at optimal height where the sensors of the UAV can cover the most area and collect data with minimum uncertainty.

Title: Self-Supervised Training For Low Dose CT Reconstruction
Authors: Mehmet Ozan Unal, Metin Ertas, Isa Yildirim
Abstract: Ionizing radiation has been the biggest concern in CT imaging. To reduce the dose level without compromising the image quality, low-dose CT reconstruction has been offered with the availability of compressed sensing based reconstruction methods. Recently, data-driven methods got attention with the rise of deep learning, the availability of high computational power, and big datasets. Deep learning based methods have also been used in low-dose CT reconstruction problem in different manners. Usually, the success of these methods depends on labeled data. However, recent studies showed that training can be achieved successfully with noisy datasets. In this study, we defined a training scheme to use low-dose sinograms as their own training targets. We applied the self-supervision principle in the projection domain where the noise is element-wise independent which is a requirement for self-supervised training methods. Using the self-supervised training, the filtering part of the FBP method and the parameters of a denoiser neural network are optimized. We demonstrate that our method outperforms both conventional and compressed sensing based iterative reconstruction methods qualitatively and quantitatively in the reconstruction of analytic CT phantoms and real-world CT images in low-dose CT reconstruction task.

Title: An Unsupervised Reconstruction Method For Low-Dose CT Using Deep Generative Regularization Prior
Authors: Mehmet Ozan Unal, Metin Ertas, Isa Yildirim
Abstract: Low-dose CT imaging requires reconstruction from noisy indirect measurements which can be defined as an ill-posed linear inverse problem. In addition to conventional FBP method in CT imaging, recent compressed sensing based methods exploit handcrafted priors which are mostly simplistic and hard to determine. More recently, deep learning (DL) based methods have become popular in medical imaging field. In CT imaging, DL based methods try to learn a function that maps low-dose images to normal-dose images. Although the results of these methods are promising, their success mostly depends on the availability of high-quality massive datasets. In this study, we proposed a method that does not require any training data or a learning process. Our method exploits such an approach that deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) generate patterns easier than the noise, therefore randomly initialized generative neural networks can be suitable priors to be used in regularizing the reconstruction. In the experiments, the proposed method is implemented with different loss function variants. Both analytical CT phantoms and human CT images are used with different views. Conventional FBP method, a popular iterative method (SART), and TV regularized SART are used in the comparisons. We demonstrated that our method with different loss function variants outperforms the other methods both qualitatively and quantitatively.

Title: Incremental DRL-Based Resource Management for Dynamic Network Slicing in an Urban-Wide Testbed
Authors: Haiyuan Li, Yuelin Liu, Hari Madhukumar, Amin Emami, Xueqing Zhou, Yulei Wu, Xenofon Vasilakos, Shuangyi Yan, Dimitra Simeonidou
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing provides localized resources within mobile networks to address the requirements of emerging latency-sensitive and computing-intensive applications. At the edge, dynamic requests necessitate sophisticated resource management for adaptive network slicing. This involves optimizing resource allocations, scaling functions, and load balancing to utilize only essential resources under constrained network scenarios. However, existing solutions largely assume static slice counts, ignoring the re-optimization overhead associated with management algorithms when slices fluctuate. Moreover, many approaches rely on simplified energy models that overlook intertemporal resource scheduling and are predominantly evaluated through simulations, neglecting critical practical considerations. This paper presents an incremental cooperative Multi-Agent Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (MADDPG) algorithm for resource management in dynamic edge slicing. The proposed approach optimizes long-term slicing benefits by reducing delay and energy consumption while minimizing retraining overhead in response to slice variations. Furthermore, we implement an urban-wide edge computing testbed based on OpenStack and Kubernetes to validate the algorithm's performance. Experimental results demonstrate that our incremental MADDPG method outperforms benchmark strategies in aggregated slicing utility and reduces training energy consumption by up to 50% compared to the re-optimization approach.

Title: Kernel Modelling of Fading Memory Systems
Authors: Yongkang Huo, Thomas Chaffey, Rodolphe Sepulchre
Abstract: The paper is a follow-up of the recently introduced kernel-based framework to identify nonlinear input-output systems regularized by desirable input-output incremental properties. Assuming that the system has fading memory, we propose to learn the functional that maps the past input to the present output rather than the operator mapping input trajectories to output trajectories. While retaining the benefits of the previously proposed framework, this modification simplifies the selection of the kernel, enforces causality, and enables temporal simulation.

Title: Optimizing Parameters of the LinDistFlow Power Flow Approximation for Distribution Systems
Authors: Babak Taheri, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: The DistFlow model accurately represents power flows in distribution systems, but the model's nonlinearities result in computational challenges for many applications. Accordingly, a linear approximation known as \mbox{LinDistFlow} (and its three-phase extension LinDist3Flow) is commonly employed. This paper introduces a parameter optimization algorithm for enhancing the accuracy of this approximation for both balanced single-phase equivalent and unbalanced three-phase distribution network models, with the goal of aligning the outputs more closely with those from the nonlinear DistFlow model. Using sensitivity information, our algorithm optimizes the LinDistFlow approximation's coefficient and bias parameters to minimize discrepancies in predictions of voltage magnitudes relative to the nonlinear DistFlow model. The parameter optimization algorithm employs the Truncated Newton Conjugate-Gradient (TNC) method to fine-tune coefficients and bias parameters during an offline training phase to improve the LinDistFlow approximation's accuracy. % in optimization applications. Numerical results underscore the algorithm's efficacy, showcasing accuracy improvements in $L_{1}$-norm and $L_{\infty}$-norm losses of up to $92\%$ and $88\%$, respectively, relative to the traditional LinDistFlow model. We also assess how the optimized parameters perform under changes in the network topology and demonstrate the optimized LinDistFlow approximation's efficacy in a hosting capacity optimization problem.

Title: Global and local observability of hypergraphs
Authors: Chencheng Zhang, Hao Yang, Shaoxuan Cui, Bin Jiang, Ming Cao
Abstract: This paper studies observability for non-uniform hypergraphs with inputs and outputs. To capture higher-order interactions, we define a canonical non-homogeneous dynamical system with nonlinear outputs on hypergraphs. We then construct algebraic necessary and sufficient conditions based on polynomial ideals and varieties for global observability at an initial state of hypergraphs. An example is given to illustrate the proposed criteria for observability. Further, necessary and sufficient conditions for local observability are derived based on rank conditions of observability matrices, which provide a framework to study local observability for non-uniform hypergraphs. Finally, the similarity of observability for hypergraphs is proposed using similarity of tensors, which reveals the relation of observability between two hypergraphs and helps to check the observability intuitively.

Title: Mixed Platoon Control under Noise and Attacks: Robust Data-Driven Predictive Control and Human-in-the-Loop Validation
Authors: Shuai Li, Chaoyi Chen, Haotian Zheng, Jiawei Wang, Qing Xu, Jianqiang Wang, Keqiang Li
Abstract: Controlling mixed platoons, which consist of both connected and automated vehicles (CAVs) and human-driven vehicles (HDVs), poses significant challenges due to the uncertain and unknown human driving behaviors. Data-driven control methods offer promising solutions by leveraging available trajectory data, but their performance can be compromised by noise and attacks. To address this issue, this paper proposes a Robust Data-EnablEd Predictive Leading Cruise Control (RDeeP-LCC) framework based on data-driven reachability analysis. The framework over-approximates system dynamics under noise and attack using a matrix zonotope set derived from data, and develops a stabilizing feedback control law. By decoupling the mixed platoon system into nominal and error components, we employ data-driven reachability sets to recursively compute error reachable sets that account for noise and attacks, and obtain tightened safety constraints of the nominal system. This leads to a robust data-driven predictive control framework, solved in a tube-based control manner. Human-in-the-loop experiments demonstrate that the RDeeP-LCC method significantly improves robustness against noise and attacks, while enhancing tracking accuracy, control efficiency, energy economy, driving comfort, and driving safety.

Title: Uplink Coordinated Pilot Design for 1-bit Massive MIMO in Correlated Channel
Authors: Hyeongtak Yun, Juntaek Han, Kaiming Shen, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a coordinated pilot design method to minimize the channel estimation mean squared error (MSE) in 1-bit analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). Under the assumption that the well-known Bussgang linear minimum mean square error (BLMMSE) estimator is used for channel estimation, we first observe that the resulting MSE leads to an intractable optimization problem, as it involves the arcsin function and a complex multiple matrix ratio form. To resolve this, we derive the approximate MSE by assuming the low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regime, by which we develop an efficient coordinated pilot design based on a fractional programming technique. The proposed pilot design is distinguishable from the existing work in that it is applicable in general system environments, including correlated channel and multi-cell environments. We demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the channel estimation accuracy performance compared to the conventional approaches.

Title: Sensing-Assisted Channel Estimation for Bistatic OFDM ISAC Systems: Framework, Algorithm, and Analysis
Authors: Shuhan Wang, Aimin Tang, Xudong Wang, Wenze Qu
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) has garnered significant attention in recent years. In this paper, we delve into the topic of sensing-assisted communication within ISAC systems. More specifically, a novel sensing-assisted channel estimation scheme is proposed for bistatic orthogonal-frequency-division-multiplexing (OFDM) ISAC systems. A framework of sensing-assisted channel estimator is first developed, integrating a tailored low-complexity sensing algorithm to facilitate real-time channel estimation and decoding. To address the potential sensing errors caused by low-complexity sensing algorithms, a sensing-assisted linear minimum mean square error (LMMSE) estimation algorithm is then developed. This algorithm incorporates tolerance factors designed to account for deviations between estimated and true channel parameters, enabling the construction of robust correlation matrices for LMMSE estimation. Additionally, we establish a systematic mechanism for determining these tolerance factors. A comprehensive analysis of the normalized mean square error (NMSE) performance and computational complexity is finally conducted, providing valuable insights into the selection of the estimator's parameters. The effectiveness of our proposed scheme is validated by extensive simulations. Compared to existing methods, our proposed scheme demonstrates superior performance, particularly in high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regions or with large bandwidths, while maintaining low computational complexity.

Title: A Bayesian Approach to Segmentation with Noisy Labels via Spatially Correlated Distributions
Authors: Ryu Tadokoro, Tsukasa Takagi, Shin-ichi Maeda
Abstract: In semantic segmentation, the accuracy of models heavily depends on the high-quality annotations. However, in many practical scenarios, such as medical imaging and remote sensing, obtaining true annotations is not straightforward and usually requires significant human labor. Relying on human labor often introduces annotation errors, including mislabeling, omissions, and inconsistency between annotators. In the case of remote sensing, differences in procurement time can lead to misaligned ground-truth annotations. These label errors are not independently distributed, and instead usually appear in spatially connected regions where adjacent pixels are more likely to share the same errors. To address these issues, we propose an approximate Bayesian estimation based on a probabilistic model that assumes training data include label errors, incorporating the tendency for these errors to occur with spatial correlations between adjacent pixels. However, Bayesian inference for such spatially correlated discrete variables is notoriously intractable. To overcome this fundamental challenge, we introduce a novel class of probabilistic models, which we term the ELBO-Computable Correlated Discrete Distribution (ECCD). By representing the discrete dependencies through a continuous latent Gaussian field with a Kac-Murdock-Szegö (KMS) structured covariance, our framework enables scalable and efficient variational inference for problems previously considered computationally prohibitive. Through experiments on multiple segmentation tasks, we confirm that leveraging the spatial correlation of label errors significantly improves performance. Notably, in specific tasks such as lung segmentation, the proposed method achieves performance comparable to training with clean labels under moderate noise levels.

Title: TVC: Tokenized Video Compression with Ultra-Low Bit Rate
Authors: Lebin Zhou, Cihan Ruan, Nam Ling, Zhenghao Chen, Wei Wang, Wei Jiang
Abstract: Tokenized visual representations have shown promise in image compression, yet their extension to video remains underexplored due to the challenges posed by complex temporal dynamics and stringent bit rate constraints. In this paper, we present tokenized video compression (TVC), a token-based dual-stream framework designed to operate effectively at ultra-low bit rates. TVC leverages the Cosmos video tokenizer to extract both discrete and continuous token streams. The discrete tokens are partially masked using a strategic masking scheme and then compressed losslessly with a discrete checkerboard context model to reduce transmission overhead. The masked tokens are reconstructed by a decoder-only Transformer with spatiotemporal token prediction. In parallel, the continuous tokens are quantized and compressed using a continuous checkerboard context model, providing complementary continuous information at ultra-low bit rates. At the decoder side, the two streams are fused with a ControlNet-based multi-scale integration module, ensuring high perceptual quality alongside stable fidelity in reconstruction. Overall, this work illustrates the practicality of tokenized video compression and points to new directions for semantics-aware, token-native approaches.

Barratt, Matthew J. Clarkson, Tom Vercauteren, Yipeng Hu
Abstract: Trackerless freehand ultrasound reconstruction aims to reconstruct 3D volumes from sequences of 2D ultrasound images without relying on external tracking systems. By eliminating the need for optical or electromagnetic trackers, this approach offers a low-cost, portable, and widely deployable alternative to more expensive volumetric ultrasound imaging systems, particularly valuable in resource-constrained clinical settings. However, predicting long-distance transformations and handling complex probe trajectories remain challenging. The TUS-REC2024 Challenge establishes the first benchmark for trackerless 3D freehand ultrasound reconstruction by providing a large publicly available dataset, along with a baseline model and a rigorous evaluation framework. By the submission deadline, the Challenge had attracted 43 registered teams, of which 6 teams submitted 21 valid dockerized solutions. The submitted methods span a wide range of approaches, including the state space model, the recurrent model, the registration-driven volume refinement, the attention mechanism, and the physics-informed model. This paper provides a comprehensive background introduction and literature review in the field, presents an overview of the challenge design and dataset, and offers a comparative analysis of submitted methods across multiple evaluation metrics. These analyses highlight both the progress and the current limitations of state-of-the-art approaches in this domain and provide insights for future research directions. All data and code are publicly available to facilitate ongoing development and reproducibility. As a live and evolving benchmark, it is designed to be continuously iterated and improved. The Challenge was held at MICCAI 2024 and is organised again at MICCAI 2025, reflecting its sustained commitment to advancing this field.

Title: Say More with Less: Variable-Frame-Rate Speech Tokenization via Adaptive Clustering and Implicit Duration Coding
Authors: Rui-Chen Zheng, Wenrui Liu, Hui-Peng Du, Qinglin Zhang, Chong Deng, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Existing speech tokenizers typically assign a fixed number of tokens per second, regardless of the varying information density or temporal fluctuations in the speech signal. This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.

Title: Graph-Theoretic Consistency for Robust and Topology-Aware Semi-Supervised Histopathology Segmentation
Authors: Ha-Hieu Pham, Minh Le, Han Huynh, Nguyen Quoc Khanh Le, Huy-Hieu Pham
Abstract: Semi-supervised semantic segmentation (SSSS) is vital in computational pathology, where dense annotations are costly and limited. Existing methods often rely on pixel-level consistency, which propagates noisy pseudo-labels and produces fragmented or topologically invalid masks. We propose Topology Graph Consistency (TGC), a framework that integrates graph-theoretic constraints by aligning Laplacian spectra, component counts, and adjacency statistics between prediction graphs and references. This enforces global topology and improves segmentation accuracy. Experiments on GlaS and CRAG demonstrate that TGC achieves state-of-the-art performance under 5-10% supervision and significantly narrows the gap to full supervision.

Title: A Phase Synthesizer for Decorrelation to Improve Acoustic Feedback Cancellation
Authors: Klaus Linhard, Philipp Bulling
Abstract: Undesired acoustic feedback is a known issue in communication systems, such as speech in-car communication, public address systems, or hearing aids. Without additional precautions, there is a high risk that the adaptive filter - intended to cancel the feedback path - also suppresses parts of the desired signal. One solution is to decorrelate the loudspeaker and microphone signals. In this work, we combine the two decorrelation approaches frequency shifting and phase modulation in a unified framework: a so-called \textit{phase synthesizer}, implemented in a discrete Fourier transform (DFT) filter bank. Furthermore, we extend the phase modulation technique using variable delay lines, as known from vibrato and chorus effects. We demonstrate the benefits of the proposed phase synthesizer using an example from speech in-car communication, employing an adaptive frequency-domain Kalman filter. Improvements in system stability, speech quality measured by perceptual evaluation of speech quality (PESQ) are presented.

Title: Disentangling the effects of peripheral hearing loss and higher-level processes on speech intelligibility in older adults
Authors: Toshio Irino, Ayako Yamamoto, Fuki Miyazaki
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel approach to disentangle the effects of peripheral hearing loss (HL) and higher-level processes on speech intelligibility (SI). We conducted an SI experiment with 15 young normal-hearing (YNH) listeners using stimuli processed by the WHIS simulator to emulate the hearing loss profile of a specific older adult (OA) from a previous study involving 14 OA participants. Speech-in-noise materials were presented either with ideal ratio mask (IRM) enhancement or in an unprocessed form. Results showed that the target OA achieved higher SI scores than the average YNH listener, suggesting that the OA's higher-level processes may perform more effectively than those of younger listeners. To examine the characteristics of the remaining OAs, we employed the GESI objective intelligibility measure to predict SI performance. GESI provided reasonably accurate predictions for both YNH and OA listeners. Using parameters estimated from the YNH experiment, we predicted SI scores for the 14 OA participants. The results revealed substantial variability: several OAs achieved higher SI scores than the average YNH listener, while one OA scored lower. These differences likely reflect individual variations in the efficiency of higher-level processing. Overall, these findings demonstrate that WHIS and GESI enable contrastive experiments between YNH and OA listeners, independent of hearing level, and offer a framework for investigating the role of higher-level processes in older adults on an individual basis.

Title: Optimized Design of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation for Discretizing Analog Systems
Authors: Shen Chen, Yanlong Li, Jiamin Cui, Wei Yao, Jisong Wang, Yixin Tian, Chaohou Liu, Yang Yang, Jiaxi Ying, Zeng Liu, Jinjun Liu
Abstract: A common approach to digital system design involves transforming a continuous-time (s-domain) transfer function into the discrete-time (z-domain) using methods such as Euler or Tustin. These transformations are shown to be specific cases of the Generalized Bilinear Transformation (GBT), characterized by a design parameter, $\alpha$, whose physical interpretation and optimal selection remain inadequately explored. In this paper, we propose an alternative derivation of the GBT derived by employing a new hexagonal shape to approximate the enclosed area of the error function, and we define the parameter $\alpha$ as a shape factor. We reveal, for the first time, the physical meaning of $\alpha$ as the backward rectangular ratio of the proposed hexagonal shape. Through domain mapping, the stable range of is rigorously established to be [0.5, 1]. Depending on the operating frequency and the chosen $\alpha$, we observe two distinct distortion modes, i.e., the magnitude and phase distortion. We further develop an optimal design method for $\alpha$ by minimizing a normalized magnitude or phase error objective function. The effectiveness of the proposed method is validated through the design and testing of a low-pass filter (LPF), demonstrating strong agreement between theoretical predictions and experimental results.

Title: Predictive Compensation in Finite-Horizon LQ Games under Gauss-Markov Deviations
Authors: Navid Mojahed, Mahdis Rabbani, Shima Nazari
Abstract: This paper develops a predictive compensation framework for finite-horizon, discrete-time linear quadratic dynamic games subject to Gauss-Markov execution deviations from feedback Nash strategies. One player's control is corrupted by temporally correlated stochastic perturbations modeled as a first-order autoregressive (AR(1)) process, while the opposing player has causal access to past deviations and employs a predictive feedforward strategy that anticipates their future effect. We derive closed-form recursions for mean and covariance propagation under the resulting perturbed closed loop, establish boundedness and sensitivity properties of the equilibrium trajectory, and characterize the reduction in expected cost achieved by optimal predictive compensation. Numerical experiments corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate performance gains relative to nominal Nash feedback across a range of disturbance persistence levels.

Title: Neural Directional Filtering Using a Compact Microphone Array
Authors: Weilong Huang, Srikanth Raj Chetupalli, Mhd Modar Halimeh, Oliver Thiergart, Emanuël A. P. Habets
Abstract: Beamforming with desired directivity patterns using compact microphone arrays is essential in many audio applications. Directivity patterns achievable using traditional beamformers depend on the number of microphones and the array aperture. Generally, their effectiveness degrades for compact arrays. To overcome these limitations, we propose a neural directional filtering (NDF) approach that leverages deep neural networks to enable sound capture with a predefined directivity pattern. The NDF computes a single-channel complex mask from the microphone array signals, which is then applied to a reference microphone to produce an output that approximates a virtual directional microphone with the desired directivity pattern. We introduce training strategies and propose data-dependent metrics to evaluate the directivity pattern and directivity factor. We show that the proposed method: i) achieves a frequency-invariant directivity pattern even above the spatial aliasing frequency, ii) can approximate diverse and higher-order patterns, iii) can steer the pattern in different directions, and iv) generalizes to unseen conditions. Lastly, experimental comparisons demonstrate superior performance over conventional beamforming and parametric approaches.

Title: Reduced-Complexity Model Selection and Rate Allocation for Multiple-Model Electrical Signal Compression
Authors: Corentin Presvôts, Michel Kieffer, Thibault Prevost
Abstract: This paper adapts a Multiple-Model Coding (MMC) approach for sampled electrical signal waveforms to satisfy reconstructed signal quality constraints. The baseline MMC approach consists of two stages processing vectors of Voltage and Current Signal (VCS) of constant size and producing bitstreams of constant rate but varying quality. In the proposed approach, the parametric model and the rate allocated to the first stage, as well as the residual compression method of the second stage and its associated rate, are jointly optimized to achieve a target distortion of the reconstructed signal. Three approaches are proposed. An exhaustive search serves as a baseline for comparison. Then, an approach involving a Golden Section search is exploited to determine the rate of the first stage with reduced complexity. Finally, rate-distortion models of the compression efficiency for each model in the first stage are employed to obtain a subset of promising models in the first stage and reduced-size search intervals for the rate selection in both stages. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed reduced-complexity MMC approach reduces the rate for a given distortion constraint compared to state-of-the-art solutions for VCS with equivalent complexity.

Title: Proactive Service Assurance in 5G and B5G Networks: A Closed-Loop Algorithm for End-to-End Network Slicing
Authors: Nguyen Phuc Tran, Oscar Delgado, Brigitte Jaumard
Abstract: The customization of services in Fifth-generation (5G) and Beyond 5G (B5G) networks relies heavily on network slicing, which creates multiple virtual networks on a shared physical infrastructure, tailored to meet specific requirements of distinct applications, using Software Defined Networking (SDN) and Network Function Virtualization (NFV). It is imperative to ensure that network services meet the performance and reliability requirements of various applications and users; thus, service assurance is one of the critical components in network slicing. One of the key functionalities of network slicing is the ability to scale Virtualized Network Functions (VNFs) in response to changing resource demand and to meet Customer Service Level agreements (SLAs). In this paper, we introduce a proactive closed-loop algorithm for end-to-end network orchestration, designed to provide service assurance in 5G and B5G networks. We focus on dynamically scaling resources to meet key performance indicators (KPIs) specific to each network slice and operate in parallel across multiple slices, making it scalable and capable of managing completely automatically real-time service assurance. Through our experiments, we demonstrate that the proposed algorithm effectively fulfills service assurance requirements for different network slice types, thereby minimizing network resource utilization and reducing the over-provisioning of spare resources.

Title: Mitigating Perception Bias: A Training-Free Approach to Enhance LMM for Image Quality Assessment
Authors: Baoliang Chen, Siyi Pan, Dongxu Wu, Liang Xie, Xiangjie Sui, Lingyu Zhu, Hanwei Zhu
Abstract: Despite the impressive performance of large multimodal models (LMMs) in high-level visual tasks, their capacity for image quality assessment (IQA) remains limited. One main reason is that LMMs are primarily trained for high-level tasks (e.g., image captioning), emphasizing unified image semantics extraction under varied quality. Such semantic-aware yet quality-insensitive perception bias inevitably leads to a heavy reliance on image semantics when those LMMs are forced for quality rating. In this paper, instead of retraining or tuning an LMM costly, we propose a training-free debiasing framework, in which the image quality prediction is rectified by mitigating the bias caused by image semantics. Specifically, we first explore several semantic-preserving distortions that can significantly degrade image quality while maintaining identifiable semantics. By applying these specific distortions to the query or test images, we ensure that the degraded images are recognized as poor quality while their semantics mainly remain. During quality inference, both a query image and its corresponding degraded version are fed to the LMM along with a prompt indicating that the query image quality should be inferred under the condition that the degraded one is deemed poor quality. This prior condition effectively aligns the LMM's quality perception, as all degraded images are consistently rated as poor quality, regardless of their semantic variance. Finally, the quality scores of the query image inferred under different prior conditions (degraded versions) are aggregated using a conditional probability model. Extensive experiments on various IQA datasets show that our debiasing framework could consistently enhance the LMM performance.

Title: Unmasking Deepfakes: Leveraging Augmentations and Features Variability for Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Inbal Rimon, Oren Gal, Haim Permuter
Abstract: Deepfake speech detection presents a growing challenge as generative audio technologies continue to advance. We propose a hybrid training framework that advances detection performance through novel augmentation strategies. First, we introduce a dual-stage masking approach that operates both at the spectrogram level (MaskedSpec) and within the latent feature space (MaskedFeature), providing complementary regularization that improves tolerance to localized distortions and enhances generalization learning. Second, we introduce compression-aware strategy during self-supervised to increase variability in low-resource scenarios while preserving the integrity of learned representations, thereby improving the suitability of pretrained features for deepfake detection. The framework integrates a learnable self-supervised feature extractor with a ResNet classification head in a unified training pipeline, enabling joint adaptation of acoustic representations and discriminative patterns. On the ASVspoof5 Challenge (Track~1), the system achieves state-of-the-art results with an Equal Error Rate (EER) of 4.08% under closed conditions, further reduced to 2.71% through fusion of models with diverse pretrained feature extractors. when trained on ASVspoof2019, our system obtaining leading performance on the ASVspoof2019 evaluation set (0.18% EER) and the ASVspoof2021 DF task (2.92% EER).

Title: DOTA-ME-CS: Daily Oriented Text Audio-Mandarin English-Code Switching Dataset
Authors: Yupei Li, Zifan Wei, Heng Yu, Jiahao Xue, Huichi Zhou, Björn W. Schuller
Abstract: Code-switching, the alternation between two or more languages within communication, poses great challenges for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) systems. Existing models and datasets are limited in their ability to effectively handle these challenges. To address this gap and foster progress in code-switching ASR research, we introduce the DOTA-ME-CS: Daily oriented text audio Mandarin-English code-switching dataset, which consists of 18.54 hours of audio data, including 9,300 recordings from 34 participants. To enhance the dataset's diversity, we apply artificial intelligence (AI) techniques such as AI timbre synthesis, speed variation, and noise addition, thereby increasing the complexity and scalability of the task. The dataset is carefully curated to ensure both diversity and quality, providing a robust resource for researchers addressing the intricacies of bilingual speech recognition with detailed data analysis. We further demonstrate the dataset's potential in future research. The DOTA-ME-CS dataset, along with accompanying code, will be made publicly available.

Title: OODTE: A Differential Testing Engine for the ONNX Optimizer
Authors: Nikolaos Louloudakis, Ajitha Rajan
Abstract: With over 760 stars on GitHub and being part of the official ONNX repository, the ONNX Optimizer is the default tool for applying graph-based optimizations to ONNX models. Despite its widespread use, its ability to maintain model accuracy during optimization has not been thoroughly investigated. In this work, we present OODTE, a utility designed to automatically and comprehensively evaluate the correctness of the ONNX Optimizer. OODTE adopts a straightforward yet powerful differential testing and evaluation methodology, which can be readily adapted for use with other compiler optimizers. Specifically, OODTE takes a collection of ONNX models, applies optimizations, and executes both the original and optimized versions across a user-defined input set, automatically capturing any issues encountered during optimization. When discrepancies in accuracy arise, OODTE iteratively isolates the responsible optimization pass by repeating the process at a finer granularity. We applied OODTE to 130 well-known models from the official ONNX Model Hub, spanning diverse tasks including classification, object detection, semantic segmentation, text summarization, question answering, and sentiment analysis. Our evaluation revealed that 9.2% of the model instances either caused the optimizer to crash or led to the generation of invalid models using default optimization strategies. Additionally, 30% of classification models and 16.6% of object detection and segmentation models exhibited differing outputs across original and optimized versions, whereas models focused on text-related tasks were generally robust to optimization. OODTE uncovered 15 issues-14 previously unknown-affecting 9 of 47 optimization passes and the optimizer overall. All issues were reported to the ONNX Optimizer team. OODTE offers a simple but effective framework for validating AI model optimizers, applicable beyond the ONNX ecosystem.

Title: Wi-CBR: Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition
Authors: Ruobei Zhang, Shengeng Tang, Huan Yan, Xiang Zhang, Jiabao Guo
Abstract: The challenge in WiFi-based cross-domain Behavior Recognition lies in the significant interference of domain-specific signals on gesture variation. However, previous methods alleviate this interference by mapping the phase from multiple domains into a common feature space. If the Doppler Frequency Shift (DFS) signal is used to dynamically supplement the phase features to achieve better generalization, it enables the model to not only explore a wider feature space but also to avoid potential degradation of gesture semantic information. Specifically, we propose a novel Salient-aware Adaptive WiFi Sensing for Cross-domain Behavior Recognition (Wi-CBR), which constructs a dual-branch self-attention module that captures temporal features from phase information reflecting dynamic path length variations while extracting kinematic features from DFS correlated with motion velocity. Moreover, we design a Saliency Guidance Module that employs group attention mechanisms to mine critical activity features and utilizes gating mechanisms to optimize information entropy, facilitating feature fusion and enabling effective interaction between salient and non-salient behavioral characteristics. Extensive experiments on two large-scale public datasets (Widar3.0 and XRF55) demonstrate the superior performance of our method in both in-domain and cross-domain scenarios.

Title: Optimal and Suboptimal Decoders under Finite-Alphabet Interference: A Mismatched Decoding Perspective
Authors: Sibo Zhang, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Interference widely exists in communication systems and is often not optimally treated at the receivers due to limited knowledge and/or computational burden. Evolutions of receivers have been proposed to balance complexity and spectral efficiency, for example, for 6G, while commonly used performance metrics, such as capacity and mutual information (MI), fail to capture the suboptimal treatment of interference, leading to potentially inaccurate performance evaluations. Mismatched decoding is an information-theoretic tool for analyzing communications with suboptimal decoders. In this work, we use mismatched decoding to analyze communications with decoders that treat interference suboptimally, aiming at more accurate performance metrics. Specifically, we consider a finite-alphabet input Gaussian channel under interference, representative of modern systems, where the decoder can be matched (optimal) or mismatched (suboptimal) to the channel. The matched capacity is derived using MI, while a lower bound on the mismatched capacity under various decoding metrics is derived using generalized mutual information (GMI). We show that the decoding metric in the proposed channel model is closely related to the behavior of the demodulator in bit-interleaved coded modulation (BICM) systems. Simulations illustrate that GMI/MI accurately predicts the throughput of BICM-type systems {with various demodulators}. Finally, we extend the channel model and the GMI to multiple antenna cases, with an example of multi-user multiple-input-single-output (MU-MISO) precoder optimization problem considering GMI under different decoding strategies. In short, this work discovers new insights about the impact of interference, proposes novel receivers, and introduces a new design and performance evaluation framework that more accurately captures the effect of interference.

Title: Resource Allocation for Multi-waveguide Pinching Antenna-assisted Broadcast Networks
Authors: Ruotong Zhao, Shaokang Hu, Deepak Mishra, Derrick Wing Kwan Ng
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the resource allocation for multi-dielectric waveguide-assisted broadcast systems, where each waveguide employs multiple pinching antennas (PAs), aiming to maximize the minimum achievable rate among multiple users. To capture realistic propagation effects, we propose a novel generalized frequency-dependent power attenuation model for dielectric waveguides PA systems. We jointly optimize waveguide beamforming, PA power ratio allocation, and antenna positions via a block coordinate descent scheme that capitalizes on majorization minimization and penalty methods, circumventing the inherent non-convexity of the formulated optimization problem and obtaining a computationally efficient sub-optimal solution. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed framework substantially outperforms both conventional antenna systems and single PA per waveguide configurations, clearly illustrating the intricate trade-offs between waveguide propagation loss, path loss, and resource allocation among multiple PAs.

Title: MiDashengLM: Efficient Audio Understanding with General Audio Captions
Authors: Heinrich Dinkel, Gang Li, Jizhong Liu, Jian Luan, Yadong Niu, Xingwei Sun, Tianzi Wang, Qiyang Xiao, Junbo Zhang, Jiahao Zhou
Abstract: Current approaches for large audio language models (LALMs) often rely on closed data sources or proprietary models, limiting their generalization and accessibility. This paper introduces MiDashengLM, a novel open audio-language model designed for efficient and comprehensive audio understanding through the use of general audio captions using our novel ACAVCaps training dataset. MiDashengLM exclusively relies on publicly available pretraining and supervised fine-tuning (SFT) datasets, ensuring full transparency and reproducibility. At its core, MiDashengLM integrates Dasheng, an open-source audio encoder, specifically engineered to process diverse auditory information effectively. Unlike previous works primarily focused on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) based audio-text alignment, our strategy centers on general audio captions, fusing speech, sound and music information into one textual representation, enabling a holistic textual representation of complex audio scenes. Lastly, MiDashengLM provides an up to 4x speedup in terms of time-to-first-token (TTFT) and up to 20x higher throughput than comparable models.

Title: CarboNet: A Finite-Time Combustion-Tolerant Compartmental Network for Tropospheric Carbon Control
Authors: Federico Zocco, Wassim M. Haddad, Monica Malvezzi
Abstract: While governments and international organizations have set the net-zero target to prevent a climate event horizon, practical solutions are lacking mainly because of the impracticability in completely replacing combustion processes. To address the net-zero target problem, in this paper we first design a compartmental network whose states must remain in the nonnegative orthant for physical consistency and in which the carbon dioxide emissions result from the combustion of diesel in vehicles and gas in house heaters. Then, we design both full-state and output-feedback linear-quadratic regulators of the compartmental network to bring the mass of carbon dioxide to the pre-industrial era, which is reached in approximately 25 and 60 days, respectively. The output-feedback controller tolerates for 6 days the combustion taking place in 5,000 vehicles and in 10,000 house heating systems, meets the net-zero target, and nullifies the extraction of finite natural resources. With closed-loop control, the tropospheric temperature stabilizes approximately to the pre-industrial era reference condition, i.e., to 13.5 °C, which is 21.7 °C lower than the steady-state temperature achieved without carbon capture. This work is a first step in designing optimal network control systems for climate stability. Source code is publicly available.

Title: Intraoperative 2D/3D Registration via Spherical Similarity Learning and Inference-Time Differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt Optimization
Authors: Minheng Chen, Youyong Kong
Abstract: Intraoperative 2D/3D registration aligns preoperative 3D volumes with real-time 2D radiographs, enabling accurate localization of instruments and implants. A recent fully differentiable similarity learning framework approximates geodesic distances on SE(3), expanding the capture range of registration and mitigating the effects of substantial disturbances, but existing Euclidean approximations distort manifold structure and slow convergence. To address these limitations, we explore similarity learning in non-Euclidean spherical feature spaces to better capture and fit complex manifold structure. We extract feature embeddings using a CNN-Transformer encoder, project them into spherical space, and approximate their geodesic distances with Riemannian distances in the bi-invariant SO(4) space. This enables a more expressive and geometrically consistent deep similarity metric, enhancing the ability to distinguish subtle pose differences. During inference, we replace gradient descent with fully differentiable Levenberg-Marquardt optimization to accelerate convergence. Experiments on real and synthetic datasets show superior accuracy in both patient-specific and patient-agnostic scenarios.

Title: Differential Dynamic Programming for the Optimal Control Problem with an Ellipsoidal Target Set and Its Statistical Inference
Authors: Sungjun Eom, Gyunghoon Park
Abstract: This work addresses an extended class of optimal control problems where a target for a system state has the form of an ellipsoid rather than a fixed, single point. As a computationally affordable method for resolving the extended problem, we present a revised version of the differential dynamic programming (DDP), termed the differential dynamic programming with ellipsoidal target set (ETS-DDP). To this end, the problem with an ellipsoidal target set is reformulated into an equivalent form with the orthogonal projection operator, yielding that the resulting cost functions turn out to be discontinuous at some points. As the DDP usually requires the differentiability of cost functions, in the ETS-DDP formulation we locally approximate the (nonsmooth) cost functions to smoothed ones near the path generated at the previous iteration, by utilizing the orthogonal projection operator. Moreover, a statistical inference method is also presented for designing the ellipsoidal target set, based on data on admissible target points collected by expert demonstrations. Via a simulation on autonomous parking of a vehicle, it is seen that the proposed ETS-DDP efficiently derives an admissible state trajectory while running much faster than the point-targeted DDP, at the expense of optimality.

Title: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Reliable Interpretation of Radio Regulations
Authors: Zakaria El Kassimi, Fares Fourati, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: We study question answering in the domain of radio regulations, a legally sensitive and high-stakes area. We propose a telecom-specific Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline and introduce, to our knowledge, the first multiple-choice evaluation set for this domain, constructed from authoritative sources using automated filtering and human validation. To assess retrieval quality, we define a domain-specific retrieval metric, under which our retriever achieves approximately 97% accuracy. Beyond retrieval, our approach consistently improves generation accuracy across all tested models. In particular, while naively inserting documents without structured retrieval yields only marginal gains for GPT-4o (less than 1%), applying our pipeline results in nearly a 12% relative improvement. These findings demonstrate that carefully targeted grounding provides a simple yet strong baseline and an effective domain-specific solution for regulatory question answering. All code and evaluation scripts, along with our derived question-answer dataset, are available at this https URL.

Title: Automated algorithm design via Nevanlinna-Pick interpolation
Authors: Ibrahim K. Ozaslan, Tryphon T. Georgiou, Mihailo R. Jovanovic
Abstract: The synthesis of optimization algorithms typically follows a design-first-analyze-later approach, which often obscures fundamental performance limitations and hinders the systematic design of algorithms operating at the achievable theoretical boundaries. Recently, a framework based on frequency-domain techniques from robust control theory has emerged as a powerful tool for automating algorithm synthesis. By integrating the design and analysis stages, this framework enables the identification of fundamental performance limits. In this paper, we build on this framework and extend it to address algorithms for solving strongly convex problems with equality constraints. As a result, we obtain a new class of algorithms that offers sharp trade-off between number of matrix multiplication per iteration and convergence rate.

Title: Predict-then-Optimize for Seaport Power-Logistics Scheduling: Generalization across Varying Tasks Stream
Authors: Chuanqing Pu, Feilong Fan, Nengling Tai, Yan Xu, Wentao Huang, Honglin Wen
Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance the decision quality of forecasts, decision-focused learning has been proposed, which aligns the training of forecasting models with downstream decision outcomes. However, this end-to-end design inherently restricts the value of forecasting models to only a specific task structure, and thus generalize poorly to evolving tasks induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model across a varying tasks stream with a sustainable long-term computational burden. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

Title: Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression
Authors: Cheng Yuan, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Title: ATOM-CBF: Adaptive Safe Perception-Based Control under Out-of-Distribution Measurements
Authors: Kai S. Yun, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Ensuring the safety of real-world systems is challenging, especially when they rely on learned perception modules to infer the system state from high-dimensional sensor data. These perception modules are vulnerable to epistemic uncertainty, often failing when encountering out-of-distribution (OoD) measurements not seen during training. To address this gap, we introduce ATOM-CBF (Adaptive-To-OoD-Measurement Control Barrier Function), a novel safe control framework that explicitly computes and adapts to the epistemic uncertainty from OoD measurements, without the need for ground-truth labels or information on distribution shifts. Our approach features two key components: (1) an OoD-aware adaptive perception error margin and (2) a safety filter that integrates this adaptive error margin, enabling the filter to adjust its conservatism in real-time. We provide empirical validation in simulations, demonstrating that ATOM-CBF maintains safety for an F1Tenth vehicle with LiDAR scans and a quadruped robot with RGB images.

Title: Learning-based Radio Link Failure Prediction Based on Measurement Dataset in Railway Environments
Authors: Po-Heng Chou, Da-Chih Lin, Hung-Yu Wei, Walid Saad, Yu Tsao
Abstract: In this paper, a measurement-driven framework is proposed for early radio link failure (RLF) prediction in 5G non-standalone (NSA) railway environments. Using 10 Hz metro-train traces with serving and neighbor-cell indicators, we benchmark six models, namely CNN, LSTM, XGBoost, Anomaly Transformer, PatchTST, and TimesNet, under varied observation windows and prediction horizons. When the observation window is three seconds, TimesNet attains the highest F1 score with a three-second prediction horizon, while CNN provides a favorable accuracy-latency tradeoff with a two-second horizon, enabling proactive actions such as redundancy and adaptive handovers. The results indicate that deep temporal models can anticipate reliability degradations several seconds in advance using lightweight features available on commercial devices, offering a practical path to early-warning control in 5G-based railway systems.
