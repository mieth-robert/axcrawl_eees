Title: Wideband Antenna Deconvolution for Bistatic Millimeter Wave Radar Reflectivity Measurements
Authors: Carsten Andrich, Isabella Varga, Tobias F. Nowack, Alexander Ihlow, Sebastian Giehl, Michael Schubert, Reiner S. Thomä, Matthias A. Hein
Abstract: Bistatic radar measurements offer unique spatial diversity and enhanced target characterization capabilities, rendering them increasingly vital for contemporary sensing application research. The reliability of such measurements is contingent upon precise system and antenna calibration. The prevailing technique is the substitution method, which involves the use of known reference objects. We propose an over-the-air calibration algorithm for spherical bistatic measurement systems. Our method is both significantly simpler and twice as fast as existing algorithms. The application of our technique to reflectivity measurements of a metal sphere from 76 to 81 GHz demonstrates a dynamic range enhancement of up to 40 dB when compared with uncalibrated data. A comparison with simulation data demonstrates a high degree of agreement between measurement and simulation.

Title: AsyncVoice Agent: Real-Time Explanation for LLM Planning and Reasoning
Authors: Yueqian Lin, Zhengmian Hu, Jayakumar Subramanian, Qinsi Wang, Nikos Vlassis, Hai "Helen" Li, Yiran Chen
Abstract: Effective human-AI collaboration on complex reasoning tasks requires that users understand and interact with the model's process, not just receive an output. However, the monolithic text from methods like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prevents this, as current interfaces lack real-time verbalization and robust user barge-in. We present AsyncVoice Agent, a system whose asynchronous architecture decouples a streaming LLM backend from a conversational voice frontend. This design allows narration and inference to run in parallel, empowering users to interrupt, query, and steer the model's reasoning process at any time. Objective benchmarks show this approach reduces interaction latency by more than 600x compared to monolithic baselines while ensuring high fidelity and competitive task accuracy. By enabling a two-way dialogue with a model's thought process, AsyncVoice Agent offers a new paradigm for building more effective, steerable, and trustworthy human-AI systems for high-stakes tasks.

Title: Fast, Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing for Multiple Diffraction and Reflection Paths
Authors: Jérome Eertmans, Sophie Lequeu, Benoît Legat, Laurent Jacques, Claude Oestges
Abstract: We present a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated optimization method for ray path tracing in environments containing planar reflectors and straight diffraction edges. Based on Fermat's principle, our approach reformulates the path-finding problem as the minimization of total path length, enabling efficient parallel execution on modern GPU architectures. Unlike existing methods that require separate algorithms for reflections and diffractions, our unified formulation maintains consistent problem dimensions across all interaction sequences, making it particularly suitable for vectorized computation. Through implicit differentiation, we achieve efficient gradient computation without differentiating through solver iterations, significantly outperforming traditional automatic differentiation approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence rates comparable to specialized Newton methods while providing superior scalability for large-scale applications. The method integrates seamlessly with differentiable programming libraries such as JAX and DrJIT, enabling new possibilities in inverse design and optimization for wireless propagation modeling.

Title: Performance Comparison of Joint Delay-Doppler Estimation Algorithms
Authors: Lorenz Mohr, Michael Döbereiner, Steffen Schieler, Joerg Robert, Christian Schneider, Sebastian Semper, Reiner S. Thoma
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), radar, and beamforming require real-time, high-resolution estimation algorithms to determine delay-Doppler values of specular paths within the wireless propagation channel. Our contribution is the measurement-based performance comparison of the delay-Doppler estimation between three different algorithms, comprising maximum likelihood (ML), convolutional neural network (CNN), and constant false alarm rate (CFAR) approaches. We apply these algorithms to publicly available channel data which includes two spherical targets with analytically describable delay-Doppler parameters. The comparison of the three algorithms features the target detection rate, root mean squared errors (RMSEs) of the delay-Doppler estimates, and a runtime analysis. Notably, all three algorithms demonstrate similar parameter estimation capabilities in bi-static scenarios, achieving target detection probabilities of up to 80%. Conversely, forward and backward scattering conditions pose a problem to the estimation due to strong line-of-sight (LoS) contribution, reducing the corresponding detection probability down to 0%.

Title: A Motivational Driver Steering Model: Task Difficulty Homeostasis From Control Theory Perspective
Authors: H. Mozaffari, A. Nahvi
Abstract: A general and psychologically plausible collision avoidance driver model can improve transportation safety significantly. Most computational driver models found in the literature have used control theory methods only, and they are not established based on psychological theories. In this paper, a unified approach is presented based on concepts taken from psychology and control theory. The "task difficulty homeostasis theory", a prominent motivational theory, is combined with the "Lyapunov stability method" in control theory to present a general and psychologically plausible model. This approach is used to model driver steering behavior for collision avoidance. The performance of this model is measured by simulation of two collision avoidance scenarios at a wide range of speeds from 20 km/h to 170 km/h. The model is validated by experiments on a driving simulator. The results demonstrate that the model follows human behavior accurately with a mean error of 7 percent.

Title: Spatial-to-Spectral Harmonic-Modulated Arrays for 6G Multi-Beam MIMO
Authors: Jose Guajardo, Ali Niknejad
Abstract: This article presents an overview and analysis of spatial-to-spectral harmonic-modulated arrays (SHAs). Compared to traditional analog or digital beamforming arrays, SHAs enable concurrent multi-beamforming without requiring substantial hardware replication. SHAs replace the need for hardware replication with frequency-domain multiplexing. Furthermore, SHAs have the potential to become key contributors to future 6G networks by enabling scalable multi-user communications, joint communication and sensing, and spatial interference mitigation. In addition, an analysis of the SHA's harmonic-modulation waveform and its effects on gain, noise and bandwidth is presented. A comb-like modulation waveform for SHAs that minimizes spectral inefficiency is proposed. Further, an analysis of the SHA's capability to independently steer multiple beams is presented. This capability is quantified in terms of the SHA's spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom. Lastly, this work introduces a novel SHA architecture that provides three spatial-to-spectral degrees of freedom with minimal hardware replication.

Title: Towards Smart Manufacturing Metaverse via Digital Twinning in Extended Reality
Authors: Hui Yang, Faisal Aqlan, Richard Zhao
Abstract: The rapid evolution of modern manufacturing systems is driven by the integration of emerging metaverse technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI), digital twin (DT) with different forms of extended reality (XR) like virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and mixed reality (MR). These advances confront manufacturing workers with complex and evolving environments that demand digital literacy for problem solving in the future workplace. However, manufacturing industry faces a critical shortage of skilled workforce with digital literacy in the world. Further, global pandemic has significantly changed how people work and collaborate digitally and remotely. There is an urgent need to rethink digital platformization and leverage emerging technologies to propel industrial evolution toward human-centered manufacturing metaverse (MfgVerse). This paper presents a forward-looking perspective on the development of smart MfgVerse, highlighting current efforts in learning factory, cognitive digital twinning, and the new sharing economy of manufacturing-as-a-service (MaaS). MfgVerse is converging into multiplex networks, including a social network of human stakeholders, an interconnected network of manufacturing things or agents (e.g., machines, robots, facilities, material handling systems), a network of digital twins of physical things, as well as auxiliary networks of sales, supply chain, logistics, and remanufacturing systems. We also showcase the design and development of a learning factory for workforce training in extended reality. Finally, future directions, challenges, and opportunities are discussed for human-centered manufacturing metaverse. We hope this work helps stimulate more comprehensive studies and in-depth research efforts to advance MfgVerse technologies.

Title: Delay Minimization in Pinching-Antenna-enabled NOMA-MEC Networks
Authors: Yuan Ai, Xidong Mu, Pengbo Si, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel pinching antenna systems (PASS) enabled non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) multi-access edge computing (MEC) framework. An optimization problem is formulated to minimize the maximum task delay by optimizing offloading ratios, transmit powers, and pinching antenna (PA) positions, subject to constraints on maximum transmit power, user energy budgets, and minimum PA separation to mitigate coupling effects. To address the non-convex problem, a bisection search-based alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is developed, where each subproblem is iteratively solved for a given task delay. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces the task delay compared to benchmark schemes.

Title: AC Dynamics-aware Trajectory Optimization with Binary Enforcement for Adaptive UFLS Design
Authors: Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey
Abstract: The high penetration of distributed energy resources, resulting in backfeed of power at the transmission and distribution interface, is causing conventional underfrequency load shedding (UFLS) schemes to become nonconforming. Adaptive schemes that update UFLS relay settings recursively in time offer a solution, but existing adaptive techniques that obtain UFLS relay settings with linearized or reduced-order model formulations fail to capture AC nonlinear network behavior. In practice, this will result in relays unable to restore system frequency during adverse disturbances. We formulate an adaptive UFLS problem as a trajectory optimization and include the full AC nonlinear network dynamics to ensure AC feasibility and time-coordinated control actions. We include binary decisions to model relay switching action and time-delayed multi-stage load-shedding. However, this formulation results in an intractable MINLP problem. To enforce model tractability, we relax these binary variables into continuous surrogates and reformulate the MINLP as a sequence of NLPs. We solve the NLPs with a homotopy-driven method that enforces near-integer-feasible solutions. We evaluate the framework on multiple synthetic transmission systems and demonstrate that it scales efficiently to networks exceeding 1500+ nodes with over 170k+ continuous and 73k+ binary decision variables, while successfully recovering binary-feasible solutions that arrest the frequency decline during worst-case disturbance.

Title: Lung Cancer Classification from CT Images Using ResNet
Authors: Olajumoke O. Adekunle, Joseph D. Akinyemi, Khadijat T. Ladoja, Olufade F.W. Onifade
Abstract: Lung cancer, a malignancy originating in lung tissues, is commonly diagnosed and classified using medical imaging techniques, particularly computed tomography (CT). Despite the integration of machine learning and deep learning methods, the predictive efficacy of automated systems for lung cancer classification from CT images remains below the desired threshold for clinical adoption. Existing research predominantly focuses on binary classification, distinguishing between malignant and benign lung nodules. In this study, a novel deep learning-based approach is introduced, aimed at an improved multi-class classification, discerning various subtypes of lung cancer from CT images. Leveraging a pre-trained ResNet model, lung tissue images were classified into three distinct classes, two of which denote malignancy and one benign. Employing a dataset comprising 15,000 lung CT images sourced from the LC25000 histopathological images, the ResNet50 model was trained on 10,200 images, validated on 2,550 images, and tested on the remaining 2,250 images. Through the incorporation of custom layers atop the ResNet architecture and meticulous hyperparameter fine-tuning, a remarkable test accuracy of 98.8% was recorded. This represents a notable enhancement over the performance of prior models on the same dataset.

Title: Time-Embedded Algorithm Unrolling for Computational MRI
Authors: Junno Yun, Yaşar Utku Alçalar, Mehmet Akçakaya
Abstract: Algorithm unrolling methods have proven powerful for solving the regularized least squares problem in computational magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). These approaches unfold an iterative algorithm with a fixed number of iterations, typically alternating between a neural network-based proximal operator for regularization, a data fidelity operation and auxiliary updates with learnable parameters. While the connection to optimization methods dictate that the proximal operator network should be shared across unrolls, this can introduce artifacts or blurring. Heuristically, practitioners have shown that using distinct networks may be beneficial, but this significantly increases the number of learnable parameters, making it challenging to prevent overfitting. To address these shortcomings, by taking inspirations from proximal operators with varying thresholds in approximate message passing (AMP) and the success of time-embedding in diffusion models, we propose a time-embedded algorithm unrolling scheme for inverse problems. Specifically, we introduce a novel perspective on the iteration-dependent proximal operation in vector AMP (VAMP) and the subsequent Onsager correction in the context of algorithm unrolling, framing them as a time-embedded neural network. Similarly, the scalar weights in the data fidelity operation and its associated Onsager correction are cast as time-dependent learnable parameters. Our extensive experiments on the fastMRI dataset, spanning various acceleration rates and datasets, demonstrate that our method effectively reduces aliasing artifacts and mitigates noise amplification, achieving state-of-the-art performance. Furthermore, we show that our time-embedding strategy extends to existing algorithm unrolling approaches, enhancing reconstruction quality without increasing the computational complexity significantly.

Title: Computer Navigated Spinal Surgery Using Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Augmented Reality
Authors: Songyuan Lu, Jingwen Hui, Jake Weeks, David B. Berry, Fanny Chapelin, Frank Talke
Abstract: Current spinal pain management procedures, such as radiofrequency ablation (RFA) and epidural steroid injection (ESI), rely on fluoroscopy for needle placement which exposes patients and physicians to ionizing radiation. In this paper, we investigate a radiation-free surgical navigation system for spinal pain management procedures that combines magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with fiducial ArUco marker-based augmented reality (AR). High-resolution MRI scans of a lumbar spinal phantom were obtained and assembled as a surface mesh. Laplacian smoothing algorithms were then applied to smoothen the surface and improve the model fidelity. A commercially available stereo camera (ZED2) was used to track single or dual fiducial ArUco markers on the patient to determine the patient's real-time pose. Custom AR software was applied to overlay the MRI image onto the patient, allowing the physician to see not only the outer surface of the patient but also the complete anatomy of the patient below the surface. Needle-insertion trials on a 3D-printed 3-vertebra phantom showed that dual-ArUco marker tracking increased the accuracy of needle insertions and reduced the average needle misplacement distance compared to single-ArUco marker procedures. The average needle misplacement is comparable to the average deviation of 2 mm for conventional epidural techniques using fluoroscopy. Our radiation-free system demonstrates promise to serve as an alternative to fluoroscopy by improving image-guided spinal navigation.

Title: Supervisory Control of Hybrid Power Plants Using Online Feedback Optimization: Designs and Validations with a Hybrid Co-Simulation Engine
Authors: Sayak Mukherjee, Himanshu Sharma, Wenceslao Shaw Cortez, Genevieve Starke, Michael Sinner, Brooke J. Stanislawski, Zachary Tully, Paul Fleming, Sonja Glavaski
Abstract: This research investigates designing a supervisory feedback controller for a hybrid power plant that coordinates the wind, solar, and battery energy storage plants to meet the desired power demands. We have explored an online feedback control design that does not require detailed knowledge about the models, known as feedback optimization. The control inputs are updated using the gradient information of the cost and the outputs with respect to the input control commands. This enables us to adjust the active power references of wind, solar, and storage plants to meet the power generation requirements set by grid operators. The methodology also ensures robust control performance in the presence of uncertainties in the weather. In this paper, we focus on describing the supervisory feedback optimization formulation and control-oriented modeling for individual renewable and storage components of the hybrid power plant. The proposed supervisory control has been integrated with the hybrid plant co-simulation engine, Hercules, demonstrating its effectiveness in more realistic simulation scenarios.

Title: A Robust CSI-Based Scatterer Geometric Reconstruction Method for 6G ISAC System
Authors: Yubin Luo, Li Yu, Tao Wu, Yuxiang Zhang, Jianhua Zhang
Abstract: Digital twin (DT) is a core enabler of sixth generation (6G) mobile systems. As a prerequisite for DT, scatterer geometric reconstruction (SGR) in propagation environments is essential but typically requires extra sensors such as cameras and LiDAR. With integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in 6G, we reinterpret the linear sampling method (LSM) from a wireless channel viewpoint and propose a CSI based variant for sensor free SGR: by exploiting the shared channel characteristics of multipath and scattering, in band CSI replaces the scattered field measurements usually required by LSM. However, aperture limited arrays reduce LSM robustness. To address this, we propose matched filtering enhanced multi frequency LSM (MF MLSM). Multi frequency data increases frequency diversity, and matched filtering coherently aligns inter frequency phases to avoid artifacts, both of which improve robustness. Experiments with apertures of 93.6 deg, 144 deg, and 180 deg and SNRs of 27 dB and 12 dB demonstrate robust SGR with this approach.

Title: FSAR-Cap: A Fine-Grained Two-Stage Annotated Dataset for SAR Image Captioning
Authors: Jinqi Zhang, Lamei Zhang, Bin Zou
Abstract: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) image captioning enables scene-level semantic understanding and plays a crucial role in applications such as military intelligence and urban planning, but its development is limited by the scarcity of high-quality datasets. To address this, we present FSAR-Cap, a large-scale SAR captioning dataset with 14,480 images and 72,400 image-text pairs. FSAR-Cap is built on the FAIR-CSAR detection dataset and constructed through a two-stage annotation strategy that combines hierarchical template-based representation, manual verification and supplementation, prompt standardization. Compared with existing resources, FSAR-Cap provides richer fine-grained annotations, broader category coverage, and higher annotation quality. Benchmarking with multiple encoder-decoder architectures verifies its effectiveness, establishing a foundation for future research in SAR captioning and intelligent image interpretation.

Title: Adaptive Sensing Performance Design for Enhancing Secure Communication in Networked ISAC Systems
Authors: Yiming Xu, Dongfang Xu, Shenghui Song, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: The channel state information (CSI) of an eavesdropper is crucial for physical layer security (PLS) design, but it is difficult to obtain due to the passive and non-cooperative nature of the eavesdropper. To this end, integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) offers a novel solution by estimating the CSI of the eavesdropper based on sensing information. However, existing studies normally impose explicit and fixed sensing performance requirement without considering the varying communication conditions, which hinders the system from fully exploiting the synergy between sensing and communication. To address this issue, this paper proposes sensing-enhanced secure communication with adaptive sensing performance. Specifically, we formulate the sensing performance implicitly in the information leakage rate and adaptively optimize it for the minimization of the power consumption, offering enhanced flexibility and adaptability in sensing performance. We consider both centralized and decentralized designs to thoroughly investigate the impact of network structure on system performance and complexity. Specifically, we devise a block coordinate descent (BCD)-based method for centralized design. For decentralized design, we develop an optimization framework based on consensus alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) to reduce complexity and information exchange overhead. Experimental results demonstrate the advantage of the proposed implicit sensing performance requirement design due to its capability to adaptively adjust the sensing performance to enhance the system performance for varying system configurations.

Title: Real-time Measurement-based Optimization for Distribution System Operation Considering Battery Voltage and Thermal Constraints
Authors: Sen Zhan, Lingkang Jin, Haoyang Zhang, Nikolaos G. Paterakis
Abstract: The secure operation of power distribution systems is challenged by the growing integration of distributed energy resources. Leveraging the flexibility of battery storage offers a cost-effective alternative to measures like generation curtailment, which results in energy losses. However, developing an effective operational model for battery storage is hindered by inaccurate grid models, unavailability of load data, nonlinear relationship between power injections and network states, intertemporal constraints, and complex electrochemical and thermal dynamics. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a data-driven operational control scheme for battery storage in distribution systems. Linear and convex quadratic operational constraints are constructed based on real-time distribution system and battery storage measurements. Lyapunov optimization decouples multi-period battery operation, enabling a real-time, forecast-free control strategy with low computational complexity. Numerical studies using nonlinear distribution system and battery storage simulators validate the effectiveness of the approach in ensuring secure distribution system operation and satisfaction of voltage and thermal constraints of battery storage.

Title: AoI-Aware Task Offloading and Transmission Optimization for Industrial IoT Networks: A Branching Deep Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Yuang Chen, Fengqian Guo, Chang Wu, Shuyi Liu, Hancheng Lu, Chang Wen Chen
Abstract: In the Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), the frequent transmission of large amounts of data over wireless networks should meet the stringent timeliness requirements. Particularly, the freshness of packet status updates has a significant impact on the system performance. In this paper, we propose an age-of-information (AoI)-aware multi-base station (BS) real-time monitoring framework to support extensive IIoT deployments. To meet the freshness requirements of IIoT, we formulate a joint task offloading and resource allocation optimization problem with the goal of minimizing long-term average AoI. Tackling the core challenges of combinatorial explosion in multi-BS decision spaces and the stochastic dynamics of IIoT systems is crucial, as these factors render traditional optimization methods intractable. Firstly, an innovative branching-based Dueling Double Deep Q-Network (Branching-D3QN) algorithm is proposed to effectively implement task offloading, which optimizes the convergence performance by reducing the action space complexity from exponential to linear levels. Then, an efficient optimization solution to resource allocation is proposed by proving the semi-definite property of the Hessian matrix of bandwidth and computation resources. Finally, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm for efficient joint task offloading and resource allocation to achieve optimal average AoI performance. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our proposed Branching-D3QN algorithm outperforms both state-of-the-art DRL methods and classical heuristics, achieving up to a 75% enhanced convergence speed and at least a 22% reduction in the long-term average AoI.

Title: Dictionary-Based Deblurring for Unpaired Data
Authors: Alok Panigrahi, Jayaprakash Katual, Satish Mulleti
Abstract: Effective image deblurring typically relies on large and fully paired datasets of blurred and corresponding sharp images. However, obtaining such accurately aligned data in the real world poses a number of difficulties, limiting the effectiveness and generalizability of existing deblurring methods. To address this scarcity of data dependency, we present a novel dictionary learning based deblurring approach for jointly estimating a structured blur matrix and a high resolution image dictionary. This framework enables robust image deblurring across different degrees of data supervision. Our method is thoroughly evaluated across three distinct experimental settings: (i) full supervision involving paired data with explicit correspondence, (ii) partial supervision employing unpaired data with implicit relationships, and (iii) unsupervised learning using non-correspondence data where direct pairings are absent. Extensive experimental validation, performed on synthetically blurred subsets of the CMU-Cornell iCoseg dataset and the real-world FocusPath dataset, consistently shows that the proposed framework has superior performance compared to conventional coupled dictionary learning approaches. The results validate that our approach provides an efficient and robust solution for image deblurring in data-constrained scenarios by enabling accurate blur modeling and adaptive dictionary representation with a notably smaller number of training samples.

Title: Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement for Spatial Audio - Spatial-VisualVoice and the MAVE Database
Authors: Danielle Yaffe (1), Ferdinand Campe (2), Prachi Sharma (2), Dorothea Kolossa (2), Boaz Rafaely (1) ((1) School of Electrical and Computer Engineering, Ben-Gurion University of the Negev (2) Technische Universität Berlin)
Abstract: Audio-visual speech enhancement (AVSE) has been found to be particularly useful at low signal-to-noise (SNR) ratios due to the immunity of the visual features to acoustic noise. However, a significant gap exists in AVSE methods tailored to enhance spatial audio under low-SNR conditions. The latter is of growing interest with augmented reality applications. To address this gap, we present a multi-channel AVSE framework based on VisualVoice that leverages spatial cues from microphone arrays and visual information for enhancing the target speaker in noisy environments. We also introduce MAVe, a novel database containing multi-channel audio-visual signals in controlled, reproducible room conditions across a wide range of SNR levels. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed method consistently achieves significant gains in SI-SDR, STOI, and PESQ, particularly in low SNRs. Binaural signal analysis further confirms the preservation of spatial cues and intelligibility.

Title: Stabilization of Nonlinear Systems with State-Dependent Representation: From Model-Based to Direct Data-Driven Control
Authors: Lidong Li, Rui Huang, Lin Zhao
Abstract: This paper presents a novel framework for stabilizing nonlinear systems represented in state-dependent form. We first reformulate the nonlinear dynamics as a state-dependent parameter-varying model and synthesize a stabilizing controller offline via tractable linear matrix inequalities (LMIs). The resulting controller guarantees local exponential stability, maintains robustness against disturbances, and provides an estimate of the region of attraction under input saturation. We then extend the formulation to the direct data-driven setting, where a known library of basis functions represents the dynamics with unknown coefficients consistent with noisy experimental data. By leveraging Petersen's lemma, we derive data-dependent LMIs that ensure stability and robustness for all systems compatible with the data. Numerical and physical experimental results validate that our approach achieves rigorous end-to-end guarantees on stability, robustness, and safety directly from finite data without explicit model identification.

Abstract: We demonstrate digital backpropagation-based compensation of fibre nonlinearities in the near-zero dispersion regime of the O-band. Single-step DBP effectively mitigates self-phase modulation, achieving SNR gains of up to 1.6 dB for 50 Gbaud PDM-256QAM transmission over a 2-span 151 km SMF-28 ULL fibre link.

Title: Performance Evaluation of High Power Microwave Systems Against UAVs A Probabilistic Antenna Propagation Framework with Sensitivity Analysis
Authors: Muhammad Khalil, Ke Wang, Jinho Choi
Abstract: We develop a probabilistic, antenna- and propagation-centric framework to quantify the effectiveness of high-power microwave (HPM) engagements against unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). The model couples stochastic UAV kinematics, a beam-steering jitter-to-gain mapping, and atmospheric propagation (free-space spreading with gaseous and rain loss) to obtain closed-form statistics of the received pulse energy. From these, we derive analytically evaluable per-pulse and cumulative neutralization probabilities using log-normal closures and Gaussian--Hermite quadrature, and we provide a dwell-time expression under a standard pulse-independence assumption. Analytical predictions closely match large-scale Monte-Carlo simulations across broad parameter ranges. For a representative commercial threshold $E_{\mathrm{th}} = 10^{-2}\,\mathrm{J}$, the model predicts $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{kill}} \gtrsim 0.4$ per pulse and $P_{\mathrm{kill,tot}} > 99\%$ within about $0.1\,\mathrm{s}$ at kHz PRF; for hardened platforms with $E_{\mathrm{th}} = 10^{-1}\,\mathrm{J}$, $\bar{P}_{\mathrm{kill}} < 1\%$ and $P_{\mathrm{kill,tot}} < 20\%$ after $1\,\mathrm{s}$. A closed-form sensitivity (elasticity) analysis shows performance is dominated by slant range ($S_{\bar{R}} \approx -2$), with strong secondary dependence on aperture diameter and transmit power; pointing jitter and atmospheric variability are comparatively less influential in the evaluated regimes. The framework yields fast, accurate, and physics-faithful performance predictions and exposes clear antenna/propagation design levers for HPM system sizing and risk-aware mission planning.

Title: Small-Signal Stability Analysis of Power Systems by Implicit Multilinear Models
Authors: Christoph Kaufmann, Georg Pangalos, Gerwald Lichtenberg, Oriol Gomis-Bellmunt
Abstract: This paper proposes a new approach to perform small-signal stability analysis based on linearization of implicit multilinear models. Multilinear models describe the system dynamics by multilinear functions of state, input, and algebraic variables. Using suitable transformations of variables, they can also represent trigonometric functions, which often occur in power systems modeling. This allows tensor representations of grid-following and grid-forming power converters. This paper introduces small-signal stability analysis of equilibrium points based on implicit multilinear models using generalized eigenvalues. The generalized eigenvalues are computed from linear descriptor models of the linearized implicit multilinear model. The proposed approach is tested using a 3-bus network example, first by comparing time-domain simulations of the implicit multilinear model with those of the nonlinear model, and second by comparing the generalized eigenvalues with those of the linearized nonlinear model. The results show that the decomposed tensor representation of the implicit multilinear model allows for a faster linearization compared to conventional methods in MATLAB Simulink.

Title: SMP-RCR: A Sparse Multipoint Moment Matching Method for RC Reduction
Authors: Siyuan Yin, Yuncheng Xu, Lin Liu, Fan Yang, Xuan Zeng, Chengtao An, Yangfeng Su
Abstract: In post--layout circuit simulation, efficient model order reduction (MOR) for many--port resistor--capacitor (RC) circuits remains a crucial issue. The current mainstream MOR methods for such circuits include high--order moment matching methods and elimination methods. High-order moment matching methods--characterized by high accuracy, such as PRIMA and TurboMOR--tend to generate large dense reduced-order systems when the number of ports is large, which impairs the efficiency of MOR. Another common type of MOR method for many--port circuits is based on Gaussian elimination, with the SIP method as a representative. The main limitation of this method lies in the inadequate matching of high--order moments. In this paper, we propose a sparse multipoint moment matching method and present comprehensive theoretical analysis results regarding the multi--frequency high--order moment matching property. Meanwhile, to enhance the algorithm's efficiency, sparse control and deflation techniques are introduced to further optimize the algorithm. Numerical experiments demonstrated that, compared to SIP, the accuracy is improved by more than two orders of magnitude at high frequency points without adding many extra linear components. Compared to TurboMOR methods, our method achieves a speed improvement of more than twice while maintaining the same level of precision.

Title: Topology-Aware Hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE Fingerprinting via Evidence-Theoretic Fusion and Persistent Homology
Authors: Behrad Mousaei Shir-Mohammad, Behzad Moshiri, Abolfazl Yaghmaei
Abstract: Indoor localization remains challenging in GNSS-denied environments due to multipath, device heterogeneity, and volatile radio conditions. We propose a topology-aware, hybrid Wi-Fi/BLE fingerprinting framework that (i) applies physically consistent RSS normalization (dBm z-scoring or dBm -> linear mW -> z-score), (ii) denoises streams with classical Bayesian filters (KF/UKF/PF), (iii) combines complementary regressors (Random Forest and weighted kNN with a diagonal Mahalanobis metric), (iv) performs evidence-theoretic fusion via Dempster-Shafer theory (DST), and (v) augments each sample with persistent-homology (PH) descriptors. The system outputs both (x, y) estimates and interpretable belief maps, and is engineered for microcontroller-class deployment with per-update cost O(T log M + log M + Mp + S). We evaluate on two heterogeneous datasets, including a new 1,200-sample ESP32 survey, and report ablations, robustness to test-only noise, and significance across 10 stratified splits. Under 10% synthetic RSS noise, the full pipeline attains 3.40 m (Dataset 1) and 2.45 m (Dataset 2) RMSE, improving a strong PF + RF baseline by about 37%. Averaged across splits, it yields 4.993 +/- 0.15 m versus 6.292 +/- 0.13 m (20.6% relative reduction; p < 0.001). In noise-free tests, accuracy tightens to 0.44 m and 0.32 m (up to 56% better). Compared with recent learning-heavy approaches that assume large site-specific datasets and GPU inference, our method delivers competitive accuracy with formal uncertainty quantification and low computational cost suitable for real-time deployment.

Title: Linear State Estimation in Presence of Bounded Uncertainties: A Comparative Analysis
Authors: Ayan Das, Anushka Sharma, Anamitra Pal
Abstract: A variety of algorithms have been proposed to address the power system state estimation problem in the presence of uncertainties in the data. However, less emphasis has been given to handling perturbations in the model. In the context of linear state estimation (LSE), which is the focus of this paper, perturbations in the model come from variations in the line parameters. Since the actual values of the line parameters can be different from the values stored in a power utility's database, we investigate three approaches in this paper to estimate the states in the presence of bounded uncertainties in the data and the model. The first approach is based on interval arithmetic, the second is based on convex optimization, and the third is based on generalized linear fractional programming. The three algorithms are applied to multiple IEEE test systems and compared in terms of their speed and accuracy. The results indicate that the first two algorithms are extremely fast and give expected results, while the third suffers from scalability issues and is unsuitable for LSE.

Title: A Control-Theoretic Approach to Dynamic Payment Routing for Success Rate Optimization
Authors: Aniket Agrawal, Harsharanga Patil
Abstract: This paper introduces a control-theoretic framework for dynamic payment routing, implemented within JUSPAY's Payment Orchestrator to maximize transaction success rate. The routing system is modeled as a closed-loop feedback controller continuously sensing gateway performance, computing corrective actions, and dynamically routes transactions across gateway to ensure operational resilience. The system leverages concepts from control theory, reinforcement learning, and multi-armed bandit optimization to achieve both short-term responsiveness and long-term stability. Rather than relying on explicit PID regulation, the framework applies generalized feedback-based adaptation, ensuring that corrective actions remain proportional to observed performance deviations and the computed gateway score gradually converges toward the success rate. This hybrid approach unifies control theory and adaptive decision systems, enabling self-regulating transaction routing that dampens instability, and improves reliability. Live production results show an improvement of up to 1.15% in success rate over traditional rule-based routing, demonstrating the effectiveness of feedback-based control in payment systems.

Authors: Vojtěch Kovanda, Pavel Rajmic
Abstract: We present a dequantization method that employs a phase-aware regularizer, originally successfully applied in an audio inpainting problem. The method maintains the temporal continuity of sinusoidal components in the audio signal time-frequency representation and avoids the energy loss artifacts commonly encountered with l1-based regularization approaches. The proposed method is called the Phase-Aware Audio Dequantizer (PHADQ). The methods are evaluated using the objective metric SDR and PEMO-Q ODG.

Title: SAC: Neural Speech Codec with Semantic-Acoustic Dual-Stream Quantization
Authors: Wenxi Chen, Xinsheng Wang, Ruiqi Yan, Yushen Chen, Zhikang Niu, Ziyang Ma, Xiquan Li, Yuzhe Liang, Hanlin Wen, Shunshun Yin, Ming Tao, Xie Chen
Abstract: Speech codecs that convert continuous speech signals into discrete tokens have become essential for speech language models (SLMs). However, existing codecs struggle to balance high-quality reconstruction with semantically rich representations, limiting their effectiveness in both generative and understanding tasks. In this work, we propose SAC, a neural speech codec with semantic-acoustic dual-stream quantization. By disentangling semantic and acoustic modeling into two dedicated streams, SAC enables each to be optimized for its respective role. Comprehensive evaluations show that SAC achieves strong reconstruction performance across diverse bitrates under both clean and noisy conditions, with particularly high scores on UTMOS and WER, demonstrating superior perceptual quality and intelligibility. Moreover, SAC substantially outperforms state-of-the-art codecs in semantic representation, achieving a level comparable to that of self-supervised learning (SSL) continuous embeddings. Finally, our analysis of speech disentanglement highlights the effectiveness of the dual-stream design, offering new potential for controllable speech applications.

Title: Safe Payload Transfer with Ship-Mounted Cranes: A Robust Model Predictive Control Approach
Authors: Ersin Das, William A. Welch, Patrick Spieler, Keenan Albee, Aurelio Noca, Jeffrey Edlund, Jonathan Becktor, Thomas Touma, Jessica Todd, Sriramya Bhamidipati, Stella Kombo, Maira Saboia, Anna Sabel, Grace Lim, Rohan Thakker, Amir Rahmani, Joel W. Burdick
Abstract: Ensuring safe real-time control of ship-mounted cranes in unstructured transportation environments requires handling multiple safety constraints while maintaining effective payload transfer performance. Unlike traditional crane systems, ship-mounted cranes are consistently subjected to significant external disturbances affecting underactuated crane dynamics due to the ship's dynamic motion response to harsh sea conditions, which can lead to robustness issues. To tackle these challenges, we propose a robust and safe model predictive control (MPC) framework and demonstrate it on a 5-DOF crane system, where a Stewart platform simulates the external disturbances that ocean surface motions would have on the supporting ship. The crane payload transfer operation must avoid obstacles and accurately place the payload within a designated target area. We use a robust zero-order control barrier function (R-ZOCBF)-based safety constraint in the nonlinear MPC to ensure safe payload positioning, while time-varying bounding boxes are utilized for collision avoidance. We introduce a new optimization-based online robustness parameter adaptation scheme to reduce the conservativeness of R-ZOCBFs. Experimental trials on a crane prototype demonstrate the overall performance of our safe control approach under significant perturbing motions of the crane base. While our focus is on crane-facilitated transfer, the methods more generally apply to safe robotically-assisted parts mating and parts insertion.

Title: Stochastic Geometry Analysis of Asymmetric Uplink Interference for Urban UAV-RC Networks
Authors: Donggu Lee, Sung Joon Maeng, Ismail Guvenc
Abstract: Uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs) have emerged as a flexible platform for providing coverage over challenging environments, particularly for public safety and surveillance missions in urban areas. However, deploying the UAVs in dense urban areas introduces unique challenges, most notably asymmetric uplink (UL, remote controller to UAV) interference due to a higher chance of line-of-sight (LoS) interference at the UAV. In this letter, we propose a stochastic geometry framework to tractably analyze the large-scale asymmetric interference in urban areas. We incorporate a log-Gaussian Cox process (LGCP) model to capture the spatial correlation of the interference field in both UL and downlink (DL) as a function of the UAV altitude and the two-dimensional (2-D) distance between the remote controller and UAV. To quantify the UL and the DL interference asymmetry, we also define the interference asymmetry ratio characterizing the interference disparity between the UL and the DL. Our numerical results demonstrate that the interference asymmetry ratio increases as the UAV altitude and 2-D distance increase, highlighting that the UL interference worsens.

Title: Adaptive Deterministic Flow Matching for Target Speaker Extraction
Authors: Tsun-An Hsieh, Minje Kim
Abstract: Generative target speaker extraction (TSE) methods often produce more natural outputs than predictive models. Recent work based on diffusion or flow matching (FM) typically relies on a small, fixed number of reverse steps with a fixed step size. We introduce Adaptive Discriminative Flow Matching TSE (AD-FlowTSE), which extracts the target speech using an adaptive step size. We formulate TSE within the FM paradigm but, unlike prior FM-based speech enhancement and TSE approaches that transport between the mixture (or a normal prior) and the clean-speech distribution, we define the flow between the background and the source, governed by the mixing ratio (MR) of the source and background that creates the mixture. This design enables MR-aware initialization, where the model starts at an adaptive point along the background-source trajectory rather than applying the same reverse schedule across all noise levels. Experiments show that AD-FlowTSE achieves strong TSE with as few as a single step, and that incorporating auxiliary MR estimation further improves target speech accuracy. Together, these results highlight that aligning the transport path with the mixture composition and adapting the step size to noise conditions yields efficient and accurate TSE.

Title: Towards Real-Time Generative Speech Restoration with Flow-Matching
Authors: Tsun-An Hsieh, Sebastian Braun
Abstract: Generative models have shown robust performance on speech enhancement and restoration tasks, but most prior approaches operate offline with high latency, making them unsuitable for streaming applications. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of a low-latency, real-time generative speech restoration system based on flow-matching (FM). Our method tackles diverse real-world tasks, including denoising, dereverberation, and generative restoration. The proposed causal architecture without time-downsampling achieves introduces an total latency of only 20 ms, suitable for real-time communication. In addition, we explore a broad set of architectural variations and sampling strategies to ensure effective training and efficient inference. Notably, our flow-matching model maintains high enhancement quality with only 5 number of function evaluations (NFEs) during sampling, achieving similar performance as when using ~20 NFEs under the same conditions. Experimental results indicate that causal FM-based models favor few-step reverse sampling, and smaller backbones degrade with longer reverse trajectories. We further show a side-by-side comparison of FM to typical adversarial-loss-based training for the same model architecture.

Title: A Low-Complexity View Synthesis Distortion Estimation Method for 3D Video with Large Baseline Considerations
Authors: Chongyuan Bi, Jie Liang
Abstract: Depth-image-based rendering is a key view synthesis algorithm in 3D video systems, which enables the synthesis of virtual views from texture images and depth maps. An efficient view synthesis distortion estimation model is critical for optimizing resource allocation in real-time applications such as interactive free-viewpoint video and 3D video streaming services. However, existing estimation methods are often computationally intensive, require parameter training, or performance poorly in challenging large baseline configurations. This paper presents a novel, low-complexity, and training-free method to accurately estimate the distortion of synthesized views without performing the actual rendering process. Key contributions include: (1) A joint texture-depth classification method that accurately separates texture image into locally stationary and non-stationary regions, which mitigates misclassifications by using texture-only methods. (2) A novel baseline distance indicator is designed for the compensation scheme for distortions caused by large baseline configurations. (3) A region-based blending estimation strategy that geometrically identifies overlapping, single-view, and mutual disocclusion regions, predicting distortion in synthesized views from two reference views with differing synthesis conditions. Experiments on standard MPEG 3D video sequences validate the proposed method's high accuracy and efficiency, especially in large baseline configurations. This method enables more flexible camera arrangements in 3D content acquisition by accurately predicting synthesis quality under challenging geometric configurations.

Title: Differentiating Through Power Flow Solutions for Admittance and Topology Control
Authors: Samuel Talkington, Daniel Turizo, Sergio A. Dorado-Rojas, Rahul K. Gupta, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: The power flow equations relate bus voltage phasors to power injections via the network admittance matrix. These equations are central to the key operational and protection functions of power systems (e.g., optimal power flow scheduling and control, state estimation, protection, and fault location, among others). As control, optimization, and estimation of network admittance parameters are central to multiple avenues of research in electric power systems, we propose a linearization of power flow solutions obtained by implicitly differentiating them with respect to the network admittance parameters. This is achieved by utilizing the implicit function theorem, in which we show that such a differentiation is guaranteed to exist under mild conditions and is applicable to generic power systems (radial or meshed). The proposed theory is applied to derive sensitivities of complex voltages, line currents, and power flows. The developed theory of linearizing the power flow equations around changes in the complex network admittance parameters has numerous applications. We demonstrate several of these applications, such as predicting the nodal voltages when the network topology changes without solving the power flow equations. We showcase the application for continuous admittance control, which is used to increase the hosting capacity of a given distribution network.

Authors: Mengzhen Liu, Ming Li, Rang Liu, Qian Liu, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: Reconfigurable antennas (RAs), capable of dynamically adapting their radiation patterns, polarization states, and operating frequencies, have emerged as a promising technology to meet the stringent performance requirements of sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. This article systematically introduces essential hardware implementations of RAs and investigates advanced array architectures, such as fully-digital and tri-hybrid designs, emphasizing their capability to synergistically integrate electromagnetic (EM) reconfigurability with analog and digital signal processing. By facilitating coordinated beamforming across the EM and signal processing domains, RA arrays offer unprecedented flexibility and adaptability compared to conventional static antenna systems. Representative applications empowered by RA arrays, including integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), physical layer security (PLS), and near-field communications, are highlighted. A case study illustrates the effectiveness of RA arrays in optimizing beam steering, improving link robustness, and alleviating system power consumption. Finally, several open challenges and future research directions are outlined, emphasizing the need for advancements in theoretical modeling, hardware reliability, channel estimation techniques, intelligent optimization methods, and innovative network architectures, to fully realize the transformative impact of RAs in future 6G wireless networks.

Title: Semantic Intelligence: A Bio-Inspired Cognitive Framework for Embodied Agents
Authors: Wenbing Tang, Meilin Zhu, Fenghua Wu, Yang Liu
Abstract: Recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) have greatly enhanced natural language understanding and content generation. However, these models primarily operate in disembodied digital environments and lack interaction with the physical world. To address this limitation, Embodied Artificial Intelligence (EAI) has emerged, focusing on agents that can perceive and interact with their surroundings. Despite progress, current embodied agents face challenges in unstructured real-world environments due to insufficient semantic intelligence, which is critical for understanding and reasoning about complex tasks. This paper introduces the Semantic Intelligence-Driven Embodied (SIDE) agent framework, which integrates a hierarchical semantic cognition architecture with a semantic-driven decision-making process. This enables agents to reason about and interact with the physical world in a contextually adaptive manner. The framework is inspired by biological cognitive mechanisms and utilizes bio-inspired principles to design a semantic cognitive architecture that mimics how humans and animals integrate and process sensory information. We present this framework as a step toward developing more intelligent and versatile embodied agents.

Title: A Data-Driven Framework for Online Mitigation of False Data Injection Signals in Networked Control Systems
Authors: Mohammadamin Lari
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel two-stage framework for online mitigation of False Data Injection (FDI) signals to improve the resiliency of Networked Control Systems (NCSs) and ensure their safe operation in the presence of malicious activities. The first stage involves meta learning to select a base time series forecasting model within a stacked ensemble learning architecture. This is achieved by converting time series data into scalograms using continuous wavelet transform, which are then split into image frames to generate a scalo-temporal representation of the data and to distinguish between different complexity levels of time series data based on an entropy metric using a convolutional neural network. In the second stage, the selected model mitigates false data injection signals in real-time. The proposed framework's effectiveness is demonstrated through rigorous simulations involving the formation control of differential drive mobile robots. By addressing the security challenges in NCSs, this framework offers a promising approach to maintaining system integrity and ensuring operational safety.

Title: Generalized Group Selection Strategies for Self-sustainable RIS-aided Communication
Authors: Lakshmikanta Sau, Priyadarshi Mukherjee, Sasthi C. Ghosh
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is a cutting-edge communication technology that has been proposed as aviable option for beyond fifth-generation wireless communication networks. This paper investigates various group selection strategies in the context of grouping-based self-sustainable RIS-aided device-to-device (D2D) communication with spatially correlated wireless channels. Specifically, we consider both power splitting (PS) and time switching (TS) configurations, of the self-sustainable RIS to analyze the system performance and propose appropriate bounds on the choice of system parameters. The analysis takes into account a simplified linear energy harvesting (EH) model as well as a practical non-linear EH model. Based on the application requirements, we propose various group selection strategies at the RIS. Notably, each strategy schedules the k-th best available group at the RIS based on the end-to-end signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and also the energy harvested at a particular group of the RIS. Accordingly, by using tools from high order statistics, we derive analytical expressions for the outage probability of each selection strategy. Moreover, by applying the tools from extreme value theory, we also investigate an asymptotic scenario, where the number of groups available for selection at an RIS approaches infinity. The nontrivial insights obtained from this approach is especially beneficial in applications like large intelligent surface-aided wireless communication. Finally, the numerical results demonstrate the importance and benefits of the proposed approaches in terms of metrics such as the data throughput and the outage (both data and energy) performance.

Title: Robust Beamforming Optimization for STAR-RIS Empowered Multi-User RSMA Under Hardware Imperfections and Channel Uncertainty
Authors: Muhammad Asif, Asim Ihsan, Zhu Shoujin, Ali Ranjha, Xingwang Li, Khaled M. Rabie, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: This study explores the synergy between rate-splitting multiple access (RSMA) and simultaneous transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) as a unified framework to enable ubiquitous, intelligent, and resilient connectivity in future sixth-generation networks, while improving spectral and energy efficiency. Specifically, we investigate a STAR-RIS-assisted multi-user RSMA system and develop an intelligent optimization strategy that jointly designs the transmitter's active beamforming, the common stream rate allocation, and the passive beamforming vectors for the STAR-RIS transmission and reflection regions, considering transceiver hardware impairments and imperfect channel state information (CSI). In addition, system robustness is ensured via a bounded channel estimation error model that captures CSI imperfections and guarantees resilience against worst-case errors. To address the highly non-convex problem, we propose an iterative optimization algorithm that decomposes it into two sub-problems. Firstly, active beamforming vectors for the common and private signals are determined by reformulating the original problem into a convex semi-definite programming (SDP) form using successive convex approximation (SCA) and semi-definite relaxation (SDR). Secondly, passive beamforming vectors are optimized through a convex SDP reformulation by exploiting SCA and SDR techniques. Moreover, when higher-rank solutions arise, Gaussian randomization is applied to obtain rank-one solutions. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed strategy achieves significant performance gains over benchmark schemes and exhibits fast convergence.

Title: Enhanced Ground-Satellite Direct Access via Onboard Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers
Authors: Qihao Peng, Tierui Gong, Zihang Song, Qu Luo, Zihuai Lin, Pei Xiao, Chau Yuen
Abstract: Ground-satellite links for 6G networks face critical challenges, including severe path loss, tight size-weight-power limits, and congested spectrum, all of which significantly hinder the performance of traditional radio frequency (RF) front ends. This article introduces the Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receiver (RAQR) for onboard satellite systems, a millimeter-scale front end that converts radio fields to optical signals through atomic electromagnetically induced transparency. RAQR's high sensitivity and high frequency selectivity address link budget, payload, and interference challenges while fitting within space constraints. A hybrid atomic-electronic design and supporting signal model demonstrate enhanced data rate, coverage, and sensing accuracy relative to conventional RF receivers. The article concludes with integration strategies, distributed-satellite concepts, and open research problems for bringing RAQR-enabled satellite payloads into service.

Title: When 5G NTN Meets GNSS: Tracking GNSS Signals under Overlaid 5G Waveforms
Authors: Idir Edjekouane, Alejandro González Garrido, Jorge Querol, Symeon Chatzinotas
Abstract: Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) provide the backbone of Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) but remain vulnerable to interference. Low Earth Orbit (LEO) constellations within Fifth-Generation (5G) Non-Terrestrial Networks (NTN) can enhance resilience by jointly supporting communication and navigation. This paper presents the first quantitative analysis of GNSS tracking and navigation message demodulation under a hybrid waveform where a low-power Direct-Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) component is overlaid on an Orthogonal Frequency-Division Multiplexing (OFDM) 5G downlink. We evaluate a minimally modified GNSS receiver that tracks a legacy Global Positioning System (GPS) L1 Coarse/Acquisition (C/A) overlay aligned with 5G frames while treating the 5G waveform as structured interference. Using Monte Carlo simulations under realistic LEO Doppler dynamics, we analyze the Bit Error Rate (BER) of GPS L1 C/A navigation bits and the subframe decoding probability versus Signalto- Interference-plus-Noise Ratio (SINR) for multiple Signalto- Interference Ratios (SIR) and dynamic classes. Results show reliable demodulation across wide SINR ranges for low and medium dynamics, whereas high dynamics impose strict lock limits. These findings confirm the feasibility of Joint Communication and Positioning (JCAP) using a near-legacy GNSS chipset with minimal receiver modifications.

Title: Comparison and performance analysis of dynamic encrypted control approaches
Authors: Sebastian Schlor, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Encrypted controllers using homomorphic encryption have proven to guarantee the privacy of measurement and control signals, as well as system and controller parameters, while regulating the system as intended. However, encrypting dynamic controllers has remained a challenge due to growing noise and overflow issues in the encoding. In this paper, we review recent approaches to dynamic encrypted control, such as bootstrapping, periodic resets of the controller state, integer reformulations, and FIR controllers, and equip them with a stability and performance analysis to evaluate their suitability. We complement the analysis with a numerical performance comparison on a benchmark system.

Title: Efficiency-Enhanced Open Earbud Earphone Antenna Using Dual-Feed Technique
Authors: Shiming Liu, Jianhua Xie, Yan Wang
Abstract: The stringent spatial constraints and the demand for high antenna efficiency in modern wireless earphones present significant design challenges. To address these issues, this paper presents and thoroughly investigates a novel earphone antenna design specifically tailored for open earbud wireless earphones. In contrast to traditional earphone antennas that rely on a conventional single-feed configuration, the proposed design introduces a dual-feed excitation technique incorporating a controlled phase difference between the two feeds. This innovative feeding strategy effectively enlarges the equivalent radiating aperture, thereby enhancing the overall radiation efficiency of the antenna system. Experimental and simulation results demonstrate that the dual-feed approach yields an efficiency improvement exceeding 1 dB when compared with standard single-feed designs. Furthermore, the fabricated prototype achieves a -6 dB impedance bandwidth that fully encompasses the 2.4 GHz ISM band, ensuring stable wireless communication performance. The measured total efficiencies reach -8.5 dB in free space and -9.5 dB under on-head conditions. These results confirm that the proposed antenna successfully achieves high efficiency and reliable performance within the extremely limited volume of an earbud device, demonstrating strong potential for integration into next-generation compact wireless earphones.

Title: Accelerating Adaptive Systems via Normalized Parameter Estimation Laws
Authors: Mohammad Boveiri, Mohammad Khosravi, Peyman Mohajerin Esfahan
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new class of parameter estimation laws for adaptive systems, called \emph{normalized parameter estimation laws}. A key feature of these estimation laws is that they accelerate the convergence of the system state, $\mathit{x(t)}$, to the origin. We quantify this improvement by showing that our estimation laws guarantee finite integrability of the $\mathit{r}$-th root of the squared norm of the system state, i.e., \( \mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^{2/\mathit{r}} \in \mathcal{L}_1, \) where $\mathit{r} \geq 1$ is a pre-specified parameter that, for a broad class of systems, can be chosen arbitrarily large. In contrast, standard Lyapunov-based estimation laws only guarantee integrability of $\mathit{\|x(t)\|}_2^2$ (i.e., $\mathit{r} = 1$). We motivate our method by showing that, for large values of $r$, this guarantee serves as a sparsity-promoting mechanism in the time domain, meaning that it penalizes prolonged signal duration and slow decay, thereby promoting faster convergence of $\mathit{x(t)}$. The proposed estimation laws do not rely on time-varying or high adaptation gains and do not require persistent excitation. Moreover, they can be applied to systems with matched and unmatched uncertainties, regardless of their dynamic structure, as long as a control Lyapunov function (CLF) exists. Finally, they are compatible with any CLF-based certainty equivalence controllers. We further develop higher-order extensions of our estimation laws by incorporating momentum into the estimation dynamics. We illustrate the performance improvements achieved with the proposed scheme through various numerical experiments.

Title: AV1 Motion Vector Fidelity and Application for Efficient Optical Flow
Authors: Julien Zouein, Vibhoothi Vibhoothi, Anil Kokaram
Abstract: This paper presents a comprehensive analysis of motion vectors extracted from AV1-encoded video streams and their application in accelerating optical flow estimation. We demonstrate that motion vectors from AV1 video codec can serve as a high-quality and computationally efficient substitute for traditional optical flow, a critical but often resource-intensive component in many computer vision pipelines. Our primary contributions are twofold. First, we provide a detailed comparison of motion vectors from both AV1 and HEVC against ground-truth optical flow, establishing their fidelity. In particular we show the impact of encoder settings on motion estimation fidelity and make recommendations about the optimal settings. Second, we show that using these extracted AV1 motion vectors as a "warm-start" for a state-of-the-art deep learning-based optical flow method, RAFT, significantly reduces the time to convergence while achieving comparable accuracy. Specifically, we observe a four-fold speedup in computation time with only a minor trade- off in end-point error. These findings underscore the potential of reusing motion vectors from compressed video as a practical and efficient method for a wide range of motion-aware computer vision applications.

Title: Segmenting infant brains across magnetic fields: Domain randomization and annotation curation in ultra-low field MRI
Authors: Vladyslav Zalevskyi, Dondu-Busra Bulut, Thomas Sanchez, Meritxell Bach Cuadra
Abstract: Early identification of neurodevelopmental disorders relies on accurate segmentation of brain structures in infancy, a task complicated by rapid brain growth, poor tissue contrast, and motion artifacts in pediatric MRI. These challenges are further exacerbated in ultra-low-field (ULF, 0.064~T) MRI, which, despite its lower image quality, offers an affordable, portable, and sedation-free alternative for use in low-resource settings. In this work, we propose a domain randomization (DR) framework to bridge the domain gap between high-field (HF) and ULF MRI in the context of the hippocampi and basal ganglia segmentation in the LISA challenge. We show that pre-training on whole-brain HF segmentations using DR significantly improves generalization to ULF data, and that careful curation of training labels, by removing misregistered HF-to-ULF annotations from training, further boosts performance. By fusing the predictions of several models through majority voting, we are able to achieve competitive performance. Our results demonstrate that combining robust augmentation with annotation quality control can enable accurate segmentation in ULF data. Our code is available at this https URL

Title: ORIX: Orchestration of RIS with xApps for Smart Wireless Factory Environments
Authors: Sefa Kayraklik, Ali Fuat Sahin, Onur Salan, Recep A. Tasci, Recep Vural, Yusuf Islam Tek, Ertugrul Basar, Ibrahim Hokelek, Ali Gorcin, Karim Boutiba, Adlen Ksentini
Abstract: The vision of a smart wireless factory (SWF) demands highly flexible, low-latency, and reliable connectivity that goes beyond conventional wireless solutions. Reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-empowered communications, when integrated with the open radio access network (O-RAN) architectures, have emerged as a promising enabler to meet these challenging requirements. This article introduces the methodology for the orchestration of RIS with xApps (ORIX), bringing the RIS technology into the O-RAN ecosystem through xApp-based control for SWF environments. ORIX features three key components: an O-RAN-compliant RIS service model for dynamic configuration, an RIS channel simulator that supports 3GPP indoor factory models with multiple industrial scenarios, and practical RIS optimization strategies with finite-resolution control. Together, these elements provide a realistic end-to-end emulation platform for evaluating RIS placement, control, and performance in SWF environments prior to deployment. The presented case study demonstrates how ORIX enables the evaluation of achievable performance gains, exploration of trade-offs among key RIS design parameters, and identification of deployment strategies that balance system performance with practical implementation constraints. By bridging theoretical advances with industrial feasibility, ORIX lays the groundwork for RIS-assisted O-RAN networks to power next-generation wireless communication in industrial scenarios.

Title: 6D Movable Metasurface (6DMM) in Downlink NOMA Transmissions
Authors: Li-Hsiang Shen
Abstract: This letter proposes a novel six-dimensional movable metasurface (6DMM)-assisted downlink non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) system, in which a conventional base station (BS) equipped with fixed antennas serves multiple users with the assistance of a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) with six-dimensional spatial configurability. In contrast to traditional RIS with static surface, the proposed 6DMM architecture allows each element to dynamically adjust its position and orient the whole metasurface in yaw-pitch-roll axes, enabling both in spatial and electromagnetic controls. We formulate a sum-rate maximization problem that jointly optimizes the BS NOMA-based beamforming, phase-shifts, element positions, and rotation angles of metasurface under constraints of NOMA power levels, unit-modulus of phase-shifts, power budget, inter-element separation and boundaries of element position/orientation. Due to non-convexity and high-dimensionality, we employ a probabilistic cross-entropy optimization (CEO) scheme to iteratively refine the solution distribution based on maximizing likelihood and elite solution sampling. Simulation results show that the proposed CEO-based 6DMM-NOMA architecture achieves substantial rate performance gains compared to 6DMM sub-structures, conventional static RIS, and other multiple access mechanisms. It also highlights the effectiveness of CEO providing probabilistic optimization for solving high-dimensional scalable metasurface.

Title: Artificial magnetic conductor backed dual-mode sectoral cylindrical DRA for off-body biomedical telemetry
Authors: Nayab Gogosh, Sohail Khalid, Bilal Tariq Malik, Slawomir Koziel
Abstract: This research investigates the potential of a sectoral Cylindrical Dielectric Resonator Antenna (CDRA) for biomedical telemetry. CDRAs are known for their low loss, ruggedness, and stability, but their limited bandwidth and size make them unsuitable for wearable devices. The research addresses these limitations by proposing a dual mode antenna that operates in EH110 and TE210 modes. The sectoral CDRA is a quarter segment with Perfect Electric Conductor boundaries, reducing its size by a factor of four. Mathematical derivations of the field components for both modes are derived to support the design. To minimize specific absorption rate (SAR), an Artificial Magnetic Conductor (AMC) surface is applied to the antennas backside, enhancing compatibility with the transverse electric modes. The antenna achieves a bandwidth of 0.7 GHz (5.2-5.9 GHz), suitable for biomedical applications, with a measured peak gain of 7.9 dBi and a SAR of 1.24 W/kg when applied to a human arm.

Title: Semantic Joint Source Channel Coding for Distributed Subsurface Imaging in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Maximilian H. V. Tillmann, Ban-Sok Shin, Dmitriy Shutin, Armin Dekorsy
Abstract: Multi-agent systems (MAS) are a promising solution for autonomous exploration tasks in hazardous or remote environments, such as planetary surveys. In such settings, communication among agents is essential to ensure collaborative task execution, yet conventional approaches treat exploration and communication as decoupled subsystems. This work presents a novel framework that tightly integrates semantic communication into the MAS exploration process, adapting communication strategies to the exploration methodology to improve overall task performance. Specifically, we investigate the application of semantic joint source-channel coding (JSCC) with over-the-air computation (AirComp) for distributed function computation for the application of cooperative subsurface imaging using the adapt-then-combine full waveform inversion (ATC-FWI) algorithm. Our results demonstrate that semantic JSCC significantly outperforms classical point-to-point and standard JSCC methods, especially in high-connectivity networks. Furthermore, incorporating side information at the receiving agent enhances communication efficiency and imaging accuracy, a feature previously unexplored in MAS-based exploration. We validate our approach through a use case inspired by subsurface anomaly detection, showing measurable improvements in imaging performance per agent. This work underscores the potential of semantic communication in distributed multi-agent exploration, offering a communication-aware exploration paradigm that achieves task-relevant performance gains.

Title: Beam Index Map Prediction in Unseen Environments from Geospatial Data
Authors: Fabian Jaensch, Giuseppe Caire, Begüm Demir
Abstract: In 5G, beam training consists of the efficient association of users to beams for a given beamforming codebook used at the base station and the given propagation environment in the cell. We propose a convolutional neural network approach that leverages the position of the base station and geospatial data to predict beam distributions for all user locations simultaneously. Our method generalizes to unseen environments without site-specific training or specialized sensors. The results show that it significantly reduces the number of candidate beams considered, thereby improving the efficiency of beam training.

Abstract: This paper studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (CF-mMIMO) system with multiple RISs. Joint design of transmit precoding, RIS coefficients, and receive combining is investigated for uplink sum-rate maximization under in-phase and quadrature phase imbalance (IQI) at user equipments (UEs) and access points (APs). A weighted minimum mean squared error (WMMSE) based block coordinate descent (BCD) approach is proposed, where novel iterative methods are developed to efficiently solve the BCD subproblems. The efficiency of proposed approaches is demonstrated relative to heuristic methods via extensive simulations.

Title: Trajectory Optimization for Minimum Threat Exposure using Physics-Informed Neural Networks
Authors: Alexandra E. Ballentine, Raghvendra V. Cowlagi
Abstract: We apply a physics-informed neural network (PINN) to solve the two-point boundary value problem (BVP) arising from the necessary conditions postulated by Pontryagin's Minimum Principle for optimal control. Such BVPs are known to be numerically difficult to solve by traditional shooting methods due to extremely high sensitivity to initial guesses. In the light of recent successes in applying PINNs for solving high-dimensional differential equations, we develop a PINN to solve the problem of finding trajectories with minimum exposure to a spatiotemporal threat for a vehicle kinematic model. First, we implement PINNs that are trained to solve the BVP for a given pair of initial and final states for a given threat field. Next, we implement a PINN conditioned on the initial state for a given threat field, which eliminates the need for retraining for each initial state. We demonstrate that the PINN outputs satisfy the necessary conditions with low numerical error.

Title: Data-driven Communication and Control Design for Distributed Frequency Regulation with Black-box Inverters
Authors: Michael Nestor, Jiaxin Wang, Ning Zhang, Fei Teng
Abstract: The increasing penetration of inverter-based resources into the power grid, with often only black-box models available, challenges long-standing frequency control methods. Most recent works take a decentralized approach without online device coordination via communication. This paper considers both dynamic behavior and communication within secondary frequency control on an intermediate timescale. We develop a distributed data-driven approach that utilizes peer-to-peer communication between inverters to avoid the need for a central control center. To enable a trade off between communication network requirements and control performance, we present a framework to guide communication topology design for secondary frequency regulation. Following design of the inter-agent information exchange scheme, we design a controller that is structured according to the communication topology with a closed-loop stability guarantee. Case studies on the IEEE 39-bus system validate the framework and illustrate the trade-off between communication requirements and control performance that is enabled by our approach.

Authors: Kweku Abraham, Amnon Balanov, Tamir Bendory, Carlos Esteve-Yagüe
Abstract: Motivated by single-particle cryo-electron microscopy, we study the sample complexity of the multi-target detection (MTD) problem, in which an unknown signal appears multiple times at unknown locations within a long, noisy observation. We propose a patching scheme that reduces MTD to a non-i.i.d. multi-reference alignment (MRA) model. In the one-dimensional setting, the latent group elements form a Markov chain, and we show that the convergence rate of any estimator matches that of the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model, up to a logarithmic factor in the number of patches. Moreover, for estimators based on empirical averaging, such as the method of moments, the convergence rates are identical in both settings. We further establish an analogous result in two dimensions, where the latent structure arises from an exponentially mixing random field generated by a hard-core placement model. As a consequence, if the signal in the corresponding i.i.d. MRA model is determined by moments up to order $n_{\min}$, then in the low-SNR regime the number of patches required to estimate the signal in the MTD model scales as $\sigma^{2n_{\min}}$, where $\sigma^2$ denotes the noise variance.

Title: AnyRIR: Robust Non-intrusive Room Impulse Response Estimation in the Wild
Authors: Kyung Yun Lee, Nils Meyer-Kahlen, Karolina Prawda, Vesa Välimäki, Sebastian J. Schlecht
Abstract: We address the problem of estimating room impulse responses (RIRs) in noisy, uncontrolled environments where non-stationary sounds such as speech or footsteps corrupt conventional deconvolution. We propose AnyRIR, a non-intrusive method that uses music as the excitation signal instead of a dedicated test signal, and formulate RIR estimation as an L1-norm regression in the time-frequency domain. Solved efficiently with Iterative Reweighted Least Squares (IRLS) and Least-Squares Minimal Residual (LSMR) methods, this approach exploits the sparsity of non-stationary noise to suppress its influence. Experiments on simulated and measured data show that AnyRIR outperforms L2-based and frequency-domain deconvolution, under in-the-wild noisy scenarios and codec mismatch, enabling robust RIR estimation for AR/VR and related applications.

Authors: Samuel Talkington, Cameron Khanpour, Rahul K. Gupta, Sergio A. Dorado-Rojas, Daniel Turizo, Hyeongon Park, Dmitrii M. Ostrovskii, Daniel K. Molzahn
Abstract: This paper presents probabilistic bounds for the spectrum of the admittance matrix and classical linear power flow models under uncertain network parameters; for example, probabilistic line contingencies. Our proposed approach imports tools from probability theory, such as concentration inequalities for random matrices with independent entries. It yields error bounds for common approximations of the AC power flow equations under parameter uncertainty, including the DC and LinDistFlow approximations.

Title: Task-Based Quantization for Channel Estimation in RIS Empowered MmWave Systems
Authors: Gyoseung Lee, In-soo Kim, Yonina C. Eldar, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Hyeongtaek Lee, Minje Kim, Junil Choi
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate channel estimation for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) empowered millimeter-wave (mmWave) multi-user single-input multiple-output communication systems using low-resolution quantization. Due to the high cost and power consumption of analog-to-digital converters (ADCs) in large antenna arrays and for wide signal bandwidths, designing mmWave systems with low-resolution ADCs is beneficial. To tackle this issue, we propose a channel estimation design using task-based quantization that considers the underlying hybrid analog and digital architecture in order to improve the system performance under finite bit-resolution constraints. Our goal is to accomplish a channel estimation task that minimizes the mean squared error distortion between the true and estimated channel. We develop two types of channel estimators: a cascaded channel estimator for an RIS with purely passive elements, and an estimator for the separate RIS-related channels that leverages additional information from a few semi-passive elements at the RIS capable of processing the received signals with radio frequency chains. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed channel estimation designs exploiting task-based quantization outperform purely digital methods and can effectively approach the performance of a system with unlimited resolution ADCs. Furthermore, the proposed channel estimators are shown to be superior to baselines with small training overhead.

Title: A Real-Time BCI for Stroke Hand Rehabilitation Using Latent EEG Features from Healthy Subjects
Authors: F.M. Omar, A.M. Omar, K.H. Eyada, M. Rabie, M.A. Kamel, A.M. Azab
Abstract: This study presents a real-time, portable brain-computer interface (BCI) system designed to support hand rehabilitation for stroke patients. The system combines a low cost 3D-printed robotic exoskeleton with an embedded controller that converts brain signals into physical hand movements. EEG signals are recorded using a 14-channel Emotiv EPOC+ headset and processed through a supervised convolutional autoencoder (CAE) to extract meaningful latent features from single-trial data. The model is trained on publicly available EEG data from healthy individuals (WAY-EEG-GAL dataset), with electrode mapping adapted to match the Emotiv headset layout. Among several tested classifiers, Ada Boost achieved the highest accuracy (89.3%) and F1-score (0.89) in offline evaluations. The system was also tested in real time on five healthy subjects, achieving classification accuracies between 60% and 86%. The complete pipeline - EEG acquisition, signal processing, classification, and robotic control - is deployed on an NVIDIA Jetson Nano platform with a real-time graphical interface. These results demonstrate the system's potential as a low-cost, standalone solution for home-based neurorehabilitation.

Title: NVM-in-Cache: Repurposing Commodity 6T SRAM Cache into NVM Analog Processing-in-Memory Engine using a Novel Compute-on-Powerline Scheme
Authors: Subhradip Chakraborty, Ankur Singh, Xuming Chen, Gourav Datta, Akhilesh R. Jaiswal
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural network (DNN) workloads has significantly increased the demand for large-capacity on-chip SRAM in machine learning (ML) applications, with SRAM arrays now occupying a substantial fraction of the total die area. To address the dual challenges of storage density and computation efficiency, this paper proposes an NVM-in-Cache architecture that integrates resistive RAM (RRAM) devices into a conventional 6T-SRAM cell, forming a compact 6T-2R bit-cell. This hybrid cell enables Processing-in-Memory (PIM) mode, which performs massively parallel multiply-and-accumulate (MAC) operations directly on cache power lines while preserving stored cache data. By exploiting the intrinsic properties of the 6T-2R structure, the architecture achieves additional storage capability, high computational throughput without any bit-cell area overhead. Circuit- and array-level simulations in GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology demonstrate that the proposed design achieves a throughput of 0.4 TOPS and 491.78 TOPS/W. For 128 row-parallel operations, the CIFAR-10 classification is demonstrated by mapping a Resnet-18 neural network, achieving an accuracy of 91.27%. These results highlight the potential of the NVM-in-Cache approach to serve as a scalable, energy-efficient computing method by re-purposing existing 6T SRAM cache architecture for next-generation AI accelerators and general purpose processors.

Title: WaveNet's Precision in EEG Classification
Authors: Casper van Laar, Khubaib Ahmed
Abstract: This study introduces a WaveNet-based deep learning model designed to automate the classification of EEG signals into physiological, pathological, artifact, and noise categories. Traditional methods for EEG signal classification, which rely on expert visual review, are becoming increasingly impractical due to the growing complexity and volume of EEG recordings. Leveraging a publicly available annotated dataset from Mayo Clinic and St. Anne's University Hospital, the WaveNet model was trained, validated, and tested on 209,232 samples with a 70/20/10 percent split. The model achieved a classification accuracy exceeding previous CNN and LSTM-based approaches, and was benchmarked against a Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN) baseline. Notably, the model distinguishes noise and artifacts with high precision, although it reveals a modest but explainable degree of misclassification between physiological and pathological signals, reflecting inherent clinical overlap. WaveNet's architecture, originally developed for raw audio synthesis, is well suited for EEG data due to its use of dilated causal convolutions and residual connections, enabling it to capture both fine-grained and long-range temporal dependencies. The research also details the preprocessing pipeline, including dynamic dataset partitioning and normalization steps that support model generalization.

Title: Nondeterminism-Aware Optimistic Verification for Floating-Point Neural Networks
Authors: Jianzhu Yao, Hongxu Su, Taobo Liao, Zerui Cheng, Huan Zhang, Xuechao Wang, Pramod Viswanath
Abstract: Neural networks increasingly run on hardware outside the user's control (cloud GPUs, inference marketplaces). Yet ML-as-a-Service reveals little about what actually ran or whether returned outputs faithfully reflect the intended inputs. Users lack recourse against service downgrades (model swaps, quantization, graph rewrites, or discrepancies like altered ad embeddings). Verifying outputs is hard because floating-point(FP) execution on heterogeneous accelerators is inherently nondeterministic. Existing approaches are either impractical for real FP neural networks or reintroduce vendor trust. We present NAO: a Nondeterministic tolerance Aware Optimistic verification protocol that accepts outputs within principled operator-level acceptance regions rather than requiring bitwise equality. NAO combines two error models: (i) sound per-operator IEEE-754 worst-case bounds and (ii) tight empirical percentile profiles calibrated across hardware. Discrepancies trigger a Merkle-anchored, threshold-guided dispute game that recursively partitions the computation graph until one operator remains, where adjudication reduces to a lightweight theoretical-bound check or a small honest-majority vote against empirical thresholds. Unchallenged results finalize after a challenge window, without requiring trusted hardware or deterministic kernels. We implement NAO as a PyTorch-compatible runtime and a contract layer currently deployed on Ethereum Holesky testnet. The runtime instruments graphs, computes per-operator bounds, and runs unmodified vendor kernels in FP32 with negligible overhead (0.3% on Qwen3-8B). Across CNNs, Transformers and diffusion models on A100, H100, RTX6000, RTX4090, empirical thresholds are $10^2-10^3$ times tighter than theoretical bounds, and bound-aware adversarial attacks achieve 0% success. NAO reconciles scalability with verifiability for real-world heterogeneous ML compute.

Title: Learning a Generalized Model for Substation Level Voltage Estimation in Distribution Networks
Authors: Muhy Eddin Za'ter, Bri-Mathias Hodge
Abstract: Accurate voltage estimation in distribution networks is critical for real-time monitoring and increasing the reliability of the grid. As DER penetration and distribution level voltage variability increase, robust distribution system state estimation (DSSE) has become more essential to maintain safe and efficient operations. Traditional DSSE techniques, however, struggle with sparse measurements and the scale of modern feeders, limiting their scalability to large networks. This paper presents a hierarchical graph neural network for substation-level voltage estimation that exploits both electrical topology and physical features, while remaining robust to the low observability levels common to real-world distribution networks. Leveraging the public SMART-DS datasets, the model is trained and evaluated on thousands of buses across multiple substations and DER penetration scenarios. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed method achieves up to 2 times lower RMSE than alternative data-driven models, and maintains high accuracy with as little as 1\% measurement coverage. The results highlight the potential of GNNs to enable scalable, reproducible, and data-driven voltage monitoring for distribution systems.

Title: Residual Correction Models for AC Optimal Power Flow Using DC Optimal Power Flow Solutions
Authors: Muhy Eddin Za'ter, Bri-Mathias Hodge, Kyri Baker
Abstract: Solving the nonlinear AC optimal power flow (AC OPF) problem remains a major computational bottleneck for real-time grid operations. In this paper, we propose a residual learning paradigm that uses fast DC optimal power flow (DC OPF) solutions as a baseline, and learns only the nonlinear corrections required to provide the full AC-OPF solution. The method utilizes a topology-aware Graph Neural Network with local attention and two-level DC feature integration, trained using a physics-informed loss that enforces AC power-flow feasibility and operational limits. Evaluations on OPFData for 57-, 118-, and 2000-bus systems show around 25% lower MSE, up to 3X reduction in feasibility error, and up to 13X runtime speedup compared to conventional AC OPF solvers. The model maintains accuracy under N-1 contingencies and scales efficiently to large networks. These results demonstrate that residual learning is a practical and scalable bridge between linear approximations and AC-feasible OPF, enabling near real-time operational decision making.

Title: Effect of Reporting Mode and Clinical Experience on Radiologists' Gaze and Image Analysis Behavior in Chest Radiography
Authors: Mahta Khoobi, Marc Sebastian von der Stueck, Felix Barajas Ordonez, Anca-Maria Iancu, Eric Corban, Julia Nowak, Aleksandar Kargaliev, Valeria Perelygina, Anna-Sophie Schott, Daniel Pinto dos Santos, Christiane Kuhl, Daniel Truhn, Sven Nebelung, Robert Siepmann
Abstract: Structured reporting (SR) and artificial intelligence (AI) may transform how radiologists interact with imaging studies. This prospective study (July to December 2024) evaluated the impact of three reporting modes: free-text (FT), structured reporting (SR), and AI-assisted structured reporting (AI-SR), on image analysis behavior, diagnostic accuracy, efficiency, and user experience. Four novice and four non-novice readers (radiologists and medical students) each analyzed 35 bedside chest radiographs per session using a customized viewer and an eye-tracking system. Outcomes included diagnostic accuracy (compared with expert consensus using Cohen's $\kappa$), reporting time per radiograph, eye-tracking metrics, and questionnaire-based user experience. Statistical analysis used generalized linear mixed models with Bonferroni post-hoc tests with a significance level of ($P \le .01$). Diagnostic accuracy was similar in FT ($\kappa = 0.58$) and SR ($\kappa = 0.60$) but higher in AI-SR ($\kappa = 0.71$, $P < .001$). Reporting times decreased from $88 \pm 38$ s (FT) to $37 \pm 18$ s (SR) and $25 \pm 9$ s (AI-SR) ($P < .001$). Saccade counts for the radiograph field ($205 \pm 135$ (FT), $123 \pm 88$ (SR), $97 \pm 58$ (AI-SR)) and total fixation duration for the report field ($11 \pm 5$ s (FT), $5 \pm 3$ s (SR), $4 \pm 1$ s (AI-SR)) were lower with SR and AI-SR ($P < .001$ each). Novice readers shifted gaze towards the radiograph in SR, while non-novice readers maintained their focus on the radiograph. AI-SR was the preferred mode. In conclusion, SR improves efficiency by guiding visual attention toward the image, and AI-prefilled SR further enhances diagnostic accuracy and user satisfaction.

Title: Explore-then-Commit for Nonstationary Linear Bandits with Latent Dynamics
Authors: Sunmook Choi, Yahya Sattar, Yassir Jedra, Maryam Fazel, Sarah Dean
Abstract: We study a nonstationary bandit problem where rewards depend on both actions and latent states, the latter governed by unknown linear dynamics. Crucially, the state dynamics also depend on the actions, resulting in tension between short-term and long-term rewards. We propose an explore-then-commit algorithm for a finite horizon $T$. During the exploration phase, random Rademacher actions enable estimation of the Markov parameters of the linear dynamics, which characterize the action-reward relationship. In the commit phase, the algorithm uses the estimated parameters to design an optimized action sequence for long-term reward. Our proposed algorithm achieves $\tilde{\mathcal{O}}(T^{2/3})$ regret. Our analysis handles two key challenges: learning from temporally correlated rewards, and designing action sequences with optimal long-term reward. We address the first challenge by providing near-optimal sample complexity and error bounds for system identification using bilinear rewards. We address the second challenge by proving an equivalence with indefinite quadratic optimization over a hypercube, a known NP-hard problem. We provide a sub-optimality guarantee for this problem, enabling our regret upper bound. Lastly, we propose a semidefinite relaxation with Goemans-Williamson rounding as a practical approach.

Title: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Task-Assignment with Uncertain Execution Times and Preferences
Authors: Qinshuang Wei, Vaibhav Srivastava, Vijay Gupta
Abstract: While sequential task assignment for a single agent has been widely studied, such problems in a multi-agent setting, where the agents have heterogeneous task preferences or capabilities, remain less well-characterized. We study a multi-agent task assignment problem where a central planner assigns recurring tasks to multiple members of a team over a finite time horizon. For any given task, the members have heterogeneous capabilities in terms of task completion times, task resource consumption (which can model variables such as energy or attention), and preferences in terms of the rewards they collect upon task completion. We assume that the reward, execution time, and resource consumption for each member to complete any task are stochastic with unknown distributions. The goal of the planner is to maximize the total expected reward that the team receives over the problem horizon while ensuring that the resource consumption required for any assigned task is within the capability of the agent. We propose and analyze a bandit algorithm for this problem. Since the bandit algorithm relies on solving an optimal task assignment problem repeatedly, we analyze the achievable regret in two cases: when we can solve the optimal task assignment exactly and when we can solve it only approximately.

Title: DeGrip: A Compact Cable-driven Robotic Gripper for Desktop Disassembly
Authors: Bihao Zhang, Davood Soleymanzadeh, Xiao Liang, Minghui Zheng
Abstract: Intelligent robotic disassembly of end-of-life (EOL) products has been a long-standing challenge in robotics. While machine learning techniques have shown promise, the lack of specialized hardware limits their application in real-world scenarios. We introduce DeGrip, a customized gripper designed for the disassembly of EOL computer desktops. DeGrip provides three degrees of freedom (DOF), enabling arbitrary configurations within the disassembly environment when mounted on a robotic manipulator. It employs a cable-driven transmission mechanism that reduces its overall size and enables operation in confined spaces. The wrist is designed to decouple the actuation of wrist and jaw joints. We also developed an EOL desktop disassembly environment in Isaac Sim to evaluate the effectiveness of DeGrip. The tasks were designed to demonstrate its ability to operate in confined spaces and disassemble components in arbitrary configurations. The evaluation results confirm the capability of DeGrip for EOL desktop disassembly.

Title: Personalized Collaborative Learning with Affinity-Based Variance Reduction
Authors: Chenyu Zhang, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Multi-agent learning faces a fundamental tension: leveraging distributed collaboration without sacrificing the personalization needed for diverse agents. This tension intensifies when aiming for full personalization while adapting to unknown heterogeneity levels -- gaining collaborative speedup when agents are similar, without performance degradation when they are different. Embracing the challenge, we propose personalized collaborative learning (PCL), a novel framework for heterogeneous agents to collaboratively learn personalized solutions with seamless adaptivity. Through carefully designed bias correction and importance correction mechanisms, our method AffPCL robustly handles both environment and objective heterogeneity. We prove that AffPCL reduces sample complexity over independent learning by a factor of $\max\{n^{-1}, \delta\}$, where $n$ is the number of agents and $\delta\in[0,1]$ measures their heterogeneity. This affinity-based acceleration automatically interpolates between the linear speedup of federated learning in homogeneous settings and the baseline of independent learning, without requiring prior knowledge of the system. Our analysis further reveals that an agent may obtain linear speedup even by collaborating with arbitrarily dissimilar agents, unveiling new insights into personalization and collaboration in the high heterogeneity regime.

Title: MuseTok: Symbolic Music Tokenization for Generation and Semantic Understanding
Authors: Jingyue Huang, Zachary Novack, Phillip Long, Yupeng Hou, Ke Chen, Taylor Berg-Kirkpatrick, Julian McAuley
Abstract: Discrete representation learning has shown promising results across various domains, including generation and understanding in image, speech and language. Inspired by these advances, we propose MuseTok, a tokenization method for symbolic music, and investigate its effectiveness in both music generation and understanding tasks. MuseTok employs the residual vector quantized-variational autoencoder (RQ-VAE) on bar-wise music segments within a Transformer-based encoder-decoder framework, producing music codes that achieve high-fidelity music reconstruction and accurate understanding of music theory. For comprehensive evaluation, we apply MuseTok to music generation and semantic understanding tasks, including melody extraction, chord recognition, and emotion recognition. Models incorporating MuseTok outperform previous representation learning baselines in semantic understanding while maintaining comparable performance in content generation. Furthermore, qualitative analyses on MuseTok codes, using ground-truth categories and synthetic datasets, reveal that MuseTok effectively captures underlying musical concepts from large music collections.

Title: Predictability of Complex Systems
Authors: En Xu, Yilin Bi, Hongwei Hu, Xin Chen, Zhiwen Yu, Yong Li, Yanqing Hu, Tao Zhou
Abstract: The study of complex systems has attracted widespread attention from researchers in the fields of natural sciences, social sciences, and engineering. Prediction is one of the central issues in this field. Although most related studies have focused on prediction methods, research on the predictability of complex systems has received increasing attention across disciplines--aiming to provide theories and tools to address a key question: What are the limits of prediction accuracy? Predictability itself can serve as an important feature for characterizing complex systems, and accurate estimation of predictability can provide a benchmark for the study of prediction algorithms. This allows researchers to clearly identify the gap between current prediction accuracy and theoretical limits, thereby helping them determine whether there is still significant room to improve existing algorithms. More importantly, investigating predictability often requires the development of new theories and methods, which can further inspire the design of more effective algorithms. Over the past few decades, this field has undergone significant evolution. In particular, the rapid development of data science has introduced a wealth of data-driven approaches for understanding and quantifying predictability. This review summarizes representative achievements, integrating both data-driven and mechanistic perspectives. After a brief introduction to the significance of the topic in focus, we will explore three core aspects: the predictability of time series, the predictability of network structures, and the predictability of dynamical processes. Finally, we will provide extensive application examples across various fields and outline open challenges for future research.

Title: Transmission of High-Amplitude Sound through Leakages of Ill-fitting Earplugs
Authors: Haocheng Yu, Krishan K. Ahuja, Lakshmi N. Sankar, Spencer H. Bryngelson
Abstract: High sound pressure levels (SPL) pose notable risks in loud environments, particularly due to noise-induced hearing loss. Ill-fitting earplugs often lead to sound leakage, a phenomenon this study seeks to investigate. To validate our methodology, we first obtained computational and experimental acoustic transmission data for stand-alone slit resonators and orifices, for which extensive published data are readily available for comparison. We then examined the frequency-dependent acoustic power absorption coefficient and transmission loss (TL) across various leakage geometries, modeled using different orifice diameters. Experimental approaches spanned a frequency range of 1--5 kHz under SPL conditions of 120--150 dB. Key findings reveal that unsealed silicone rubber earplugs demonstrate an average TL reduction of approximately 18 dB at an overall incident SPL (OISPL) of 120 dB. Direct numerical simulations further highlight SPL-dependent acoustic dissipation mechanisms, showing the conversion of acoustic energy into vorticity in ill-fitting earplug models at an OISPL of 150 dB. These results highlight the role of earplug design for high-sound-pressure-level environments.

Title: Conformal Prediction in The Loop: A Feedback-Based Uncertainty Model for Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Han Wang, Chao Ning
Abstract: Conformal Prediction (CP) is a powerful statistical machine learning tool to construct uncertainty sets with coverage guarantees, which has fueled its extensive adoption in generating prediction regions for decision-making tasks, e.g., Trajectory Optimization (TO) in uncertain environments. However, existing methods predominantly employ a sequential scheme, where decisions rely unidirectionally on the prediction regions, and consequently the information from decision-making fails to be fed back to instruct CP. In this paper, we propose a novel Feedback-Based CP (Fb-CP) framework for shrinking-horizon TO with a joint risk constraint over the entire mission time. Specifically, a CP-based posterior risk calculation method is developed by fully leveraging the realized trajectories to adjust the posterior allowable risk, which is then allocated to future times to update prediction regions. In this way, the information in the realized trajectories is continuously fed back to the CP, enabling attractive feedback-based adjustments of the prediction regions and a provable online improvement in trajectory performance. Furthermore, we theoretically prove that such adjustments consistently maintain the coverage guarantees of the prediction regions, thereby ensuring provable safety. Additionally, we develop a decision-focused iterative risk allocation algorithm with theoretical convergence analysis for allocating the posterior allowable risk which closely aligns with Fb-CP. Furthermore, we extend the proposed method to handle distribution shift. The effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method are demonstrated through benchmark experiments.

Title: Probing the Hidden Talent of ASR Foundation Models for L2 English Oral Assessment
Authors: Fu-An Chao, Bi-Cheng Yan, Berlin Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we explore the untapped potential of Whisper, a well-established automatic speech recognition (ASR) foundation model, in the context of L2 spoken language assessment (SLA). Unlike prior studies that extrinsically analyze transcriptions produced by Whisper, our approach goes a step further to probe its latent capabilities by extracting acoustic and linguistic features from hidden representations. With only a lightweight classifier being trained on top of Whisper's intermediate and final outputs, our method achieves strong performance on the GEPT picture-description dataset, outperforming existing cutting-edge baselines, including a multimodal approach. Furthermore, by incorporating image and text-prompt information as auxiliary relevance cues, we demonstrate additional performance gains. Finally, we conduct an in-depth analysis of Whisper's embeddings, which reveals that, even without task-specific fine-tuning, the model intrinsically encodes both ordinal proficiency patterns and semantic aspects of speech, highlighting its potential as a powerful foundation for SLA and other spoken language understanding tasks.

Title: Iterative solvers for partial differential equations with dissipative structure: Operator preconditioning and optimal control
Authors: Volker Mehrmann, Manuel Schaller, Martin Stoll
Abstract: This work considers the iterative solution of large-scale problems subject to non-symmetric matrices or operators arising in discretizations of (port-)Hamiltonian partial differential equations. We consider problems governed by an operator $\mathcal{A}=\mathcal{H}+\mathcal{S}$ with symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$ that is positive (semi-)definite and skew-symmetric part $\mathcal{S}$. Prior work has shown that the structure and sparsity of the associated linear system enables Krylov subspace solvers such as the generalized minimal residual method (GMRES) or short recurrence variants such as Widlund's or Rapoport's method using the symmetric part $\mathcal{H}$, or an approximation of it, as preconditioner. In this work, we analyze the resulting condition numbers, which are crucial for fast convergence of these methods, for various partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in diffusion phenomena, fluid dynamics, and elasticity. We show that preconditioning with the symmetric part leads to a condition number uniform in the mesh size in case of elliptic and parabolic PDEs where $\mathcal{H}^{-1}\mathcal{S}$ is a bounded operator. Further, we employ the tailored Krylov subspace methods in optimal control by means of a condensing approach and a constraint preconditioner for the optimality system. We illustrate the results by various large-scale numerical examples and discuss efficient evaluations of the preconditioner, such as incomplete Cholesky factorization or the algebraic multigrid method.

Title: RefAtomNet++: Advancing Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition using Semantic Retrieval based Multi-Trajectory Mamba
Authors: Kunyu Peng, Di Wen, Jia Fu, Jiamin Wu, Kailun Yang, Junwei Zheng, Ruiping Liu, Yufan Chen, Yuqian Fu, Danda Pani Paudel, Luc Van Gool, Rainer Stiefelhagen
Abstract: Referring Atomic Video Action Recognition (RAVAR) aims to recognize fine-grained, atomic-level actions of a specific person of interest conditioned on natural language descriptions. Distinct from conventional action recognition and detection tasks, RAVAR emphasizes precise language-guided action understanding, which is particularly critical for interactive human action analysis in complex multi-person scenarios. In this work, we extend our previously introduced RefAVA dataset to RefAVA++, which comprises >2.9 million frames and >75.1k annotated persons in total. We benchmark this dataset using baselines from multiple related domains, including atomic action localization, video question answering, and text-video retrieval, as well as our earlier model, RefAtomNet. Although RefAtomNet surpasses other baselines by incorporating agent attention to highlight salient features, its ability to align and retrieve cross-modal information remains limited, leading to suboptimal performance in localizing the target person and predicting fine-grained actions. To overcome the aforementioned limitations, we introduce RefAtomNet++, a novel framework that advances cross-modal token aggregation through a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention mechanism combined with multi-trajectory Mamba modeling at the partial-keyword, scene-attribute, and holistic-sentence levels. In particular, scanning trajectories are constructed by dynamically selecting the nearest visual spatial tokens at each timestep for both partial-keyword and scene-attribute levels. Moreover, we design a multi-hierarchical semantic-aligned cross-attention strategy, enabling more effective aggregation of spatial and temporal tokens across different semantic hierarchies. Experiments show that RefAtomNet++ establishes new state-of-the-art results. The dataset and code are released at this https URL.

Title: Interpreting the Dimensions of Speaker Embedding Space
Authors: Mark Huckvale
Abstract: Speaker embeddings are widely used in speaker verification systems and other applications where it is useful to characterise the voice of a speaker with a fixed-length vector. These embeddings tend to be treated as "black box" encodings, and how they relate to conventional acoustic and phonetic dimensions of voices has not been widely studied. In this paper we investigate how state-of-the-art speaker embedding systems represent the acoustic characteristics of speakers as described by conventional acoustic descriptors, age, and gender. Using a large corpus of 10,000 speakers and three embedding systems we show that a small set of 9 acoustic parameters chosen to be "interpretable" predict embeddings about the same as 7 principal components, corresponding to over 50% of variance in the data. We show that some principal dimensions operate differently for male and female speakers, suggesting there is implicit gender recognition within the embedding systems. However we show that speaker age is not well captured by embeddings, suggesting opportunities exist for improvements in their calculation.

Title: Hallucination Benchmark for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Alkis Koudounas, Moreno La Quatra, Manuel Giollo, Sabato Marco Siniscalchi, Elena Baralis
Abstract: Hallucinations in automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems refer to fluent and coherent transcriptions produced by neural ASR models that are completely unrelated to the underlying acoustic input (i.e., the speech signal). While similar to conventional decoding errors in potentially compromising the usability of transcriptions for downstream applications, hallucinations can be more detrimental due to their preservation of syntactically and semantically plausible structure. This apparent coherence can mislead subsequent processing stages and introduce serious risks, particularly in critical domains such as healthcare and law. Conventional evaluation metrics are primarily centered on error-based metrics and fail to distinguish between phonetic inaccuracies and hallucinations. Consequently, there is a critical need for new evaluation frameworks that can effectively identify and assess models with a heightened propensity for generating hallucinated content. To this end, we introduce SHALLOW, the first benchmark framework that systematically categorizes and quantifies hallucination phenomena in ASR along four complementary axes: lexical, phonetic, morphological, and semantic. We define targeted metrics within each category to produce interpretable profiles of model behavior. Through evaluation across various architectures and speech domains, we have found that SHALLOW metrics correlate strongly with word error rate (WER) when recognition quality is high (i.e., low WER). Still, this correlation weakens substantially as WER increases. SHALLOW, therefore, captures fine-grained error patterns that WER fails to distinguish under degraded and challenging conditions. Our framework supports specific diagnosis of model weaknesses and provides feedback for model improvement beyond what aggregate error rates can offer.

Title: Enhancing Channel Estimation in RIS-aided Systems via Observation Matrix Design
Authors: Zijian Zhang, Mingyao Cui
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) have emerged as a promising technology for enhancing wireless communications through dense antenna arrays. Accurate channel estimation is critical to unlocking their full performance potential. To enhance RIS channel estimators, this paper proposes a novel observation matrix design scheme. Bayesian optimization framework is adopted to generate observation matrices that maximize the mutual information between received pilot signals and RIS channels. To solve the formulated problem efficiently, we develop an alternating Riemannian manifold optimization (ARMO) algorithm to alternately update the receiver combiners and RIS phase-shift matrices. An adaptive kernel training strategy is further introduced to iteratively refine the channel covariance matrix without requiring additional pilot resources. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed ARMO-enhanced estimator achieves substantial gains in estimation accuracy over state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Towards Intelligent Traffic Signaling in Dhaka City Based on Vehicle Detection and Congestion Optimization
Authors: Kazi Ababil Azam, Hasan Masum, Masfiqur Rahaman, A. B. M. Alim Al Islam
Abstract: The vehicular density in urbanizing cities of developing countries such as Dhaka, Bangladesh result in a lot of traffic congestion, causing poor on-road experiences. Traffic signaling is a key component in effective traffic management for such situations, but the advancements in intelligent traffic signaling have been exclusive to developed countries with structured traffic. The non-lane-based, heterogeneous traffic of Dhaka City requires a contextual approach. This study focuses on the development of an intelligent traffic signaling system feasible in the context of developing countries such as Bangladesh. We propose a pipeline leveraging Real Time Streaming Protocol (RTSP) feeds, a low resources system Raspberry Pi 4B processing, and a state of the art YOLO-based object detection model trained on the Non-lane-based and Heterogeneous Traffic (NHT-1071) dataset to detect and classify heterogeneous traffic. A multi-objective optimization algorithm, NSGA-II, then generates optimized signal timings, minimizing waiting time while maximizing vehicle throughput. We test our implementation in a five-road intersection at Palashi, Dhaka, demonstrating the potential to significantly improve traffic management in similar situations. The developed testbed paves the way for more contextual and effective Intelligent Traffic Signaling (ITS) solutions for developing areas with complicated traffic dynamics such as Dhaka City.

Title: QRTlib: A Library for Fast Quantum Real Transforms
Authors: Armin Ahmadkhaniha, Lu Chen, Jake Doliskani, Zhifu Sun
Abstract: Real-valued transforms such as the discrete cosine, sine, and Hartley transforms play a central role in classical computing, complementing the Fourier transform in applications from signal and image processing to data compression. However, their quantum counterparts have not evolved in parallel, and no unified framework exists for implementing them efficiently on quantum hardware. This article addresses this gap by introducing QRTlib, a library for fast and practical implementations of quantum real transforms, including the quantum Hartley, cosine, and sine transforms of various types. We develop new algorithms and circuit optimizations that make these transforms efficient and suitable for near-term devices. In particular, we present a quantum Hartley transform based on the linear combination of unitaries (LCU) technique, achieving a fourfold reduction in circuit size compared to prior methods, and an improved quantum sine transform of Type I that removes large multi-controlled operations. We also introduce circuit-level optimizations, including two's-complement and or-tree constructions. QRTlib provides the first complete implementations of these quantum real transforms in Qiskit.

Title: A Versatile Framework for Designing Group-Sparse Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Alireza Heshmati, Saman Soleimani Roudi, Sajjad Amini, Shahrokh Ghaemmaghami, Farokh Marvasti
Abstract: Existing adversarial attacks often neglect perturbation sparsity, limiting their ability to model structural changes and to explain how deep neural networks (DNNs) process meaningful input patterns. We propose ATOS (Attack Through Overlapping Sparsity), a differentiable optimization framework that generates structured, sparse adversarial perturbations in element-wise, pixel-wise, and group-wise forms. For white-box attacks on image classifiers, we introduce the Overlapping Smoothed L0 (OSL0) function, which promotes convergence to a stationary point while encouraging sparse, structured perturbations. By grouping channels and adjacent pixels, ATOS improves interpretability and helps identify robust versus non-robust features. We approximate the L-infinity gradient using the logarithm of the sum of exponential absolute values to tightly control perturbation magnitude. On CIFAR-10 and ImageNet, ATOS achieves a 100% attack success rate while producing significantly sparser and more structurally coherent perturbations than prior methods. The structured group-wise attack highlights critical regions from the network's perspective, providing counterfactual explanations by replacing class-defining regions with robust features from the target class.

Title: Adversarial Reinforcement Learning for Robust Control of Fixed-Wing Aircraft under Model Uncertainty
Authors: Dennis J. Marquis, Blake Wilhelm, Devaprakash Muniraj, Mazen Farhood
Abstract: This paper presents a reinforcement learning-based path-following controller for a fixed-wing small uncrewed aircraft system (sUAS) that is robust to uncertainties in the aerodynamic model of the sUAS. The controller is trained using the Robust Adversarial Reinforcement Learning framework, where an adversary perturbs the environment (aerodynamic model) to expose the agent (sUAS) to demanding scenarios. In our formulation, the adversary introduces rate-bounded perturbations to the aerodynamic model coefficients. We demonstrate that adversarial training improves robustness compared to controllers trained using stochastic model uncertainty. The learned controller is also benchmarked against a switched uncertain initial condition controller. The effectiveness of the approach is validated through high-fidelity simulations using a realistic six-degree-of-freedom fixed-wing aircraft model, showing accurate and robust path-following performance under a variety of uncertain aerodynamic conditions.

Title: Robust Dynamic Staffing with Predictions
Authors: Yiding Feng, Vahideh Manshadi, Rad Niazadeh, Saba Neyshabouri
Abstract: We consider a natural dynamic staffing problem in which a decision-maker sequentially hires workers over a finite horizon to meet an unknown demand revealed at the end. Predictions about demand arrive over time and become increasingly accurate, while worker availability decreases. This creates a fundamental trade-off between hiring early to avoid understaffing (when workers are more available but forecasts are less reliable) and hiring late to avoid overstaffing (when forecasts are more accurate but availability is lower). This problem is motivated by last-mile delivery operations, where companies such as Amazon rely on gig-economy workers whose availability declines closer to the operating day. To address practical limitations of Bayesian models (in particular, to remain agnostic to the underlying forecasting method), we study this problem under adversarial predictions. In this model, sequential predictions are adversarially chosen uncertainty intervals that (approximately) contain the true demand. The objective is to minimize worst-case staffing imbalance cost. Our main result is a simple and computationally efficient online algorithm that is minimax optimal. We first characterize the minimax cost against a restricted adversary via a polynomial-size linear program, then show how to emulate this solution in the general case. While our base model focuses on a single demand, we extend the framework to multiple demands (with egalitarian/utilitarian objectives), to settings with costly reversals of hiring decisions, and to inconsistent prediction intervals. We also introduce a practical "re-solving" variant of our algorithm, which we prove is also minimax optimal. Finally we conduct numerical experiments showing that our algorithms outperform Bayesian heuristics in both cost and speed, and are competitive with (approximate or exact) Bayesian-optimal policies when those can be computed.

Title: Geometric Control Theory Over Networks: Minimal Node Cardinality Disturbance Decoupling Problems
Authors: Luca Claude Gino Lebon, Claudio Altafini
Abstract: In this paper we show how to formulate and solve disturbance decoupling problems over networks while choosing a minimal number of input and output nodes. Feedback laws that isolate and eliminate the impact of disturbance nodes on specific target nodes to be protected are provided using state, output, and dynamical feedback. For that, we leverage the fact that when reformulated in terms of sets of nodes rather than subspaces, the controlled and conditional invariance properties admit a simple graphical interpretation. For state and dynamical feedback, the minimal input and output cardinality solutions can be computed exactly in polynomial time, via min-cut/max-flow algorithms.

Title: Local integral input-to-state stability for non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems
Authors: Yongchun Bi, Panyu Deng, Jun Zheng, Guchuan Zhu
Abstract: In this paper, we prove comparison principles for nonlinear differential equations with time-varying coefficients and develop Lyapunov analytical tools for the integral input-to-state stability (iISS) analysis of nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems, which involve nonlinearities satisfying a superlinear growth, {bringing} difficulties to the iISS {analysis.} Specifically, our approach starts by establishing several forms of comparison principles for a wide range of ordinary differential equations having time-varying coefficients and superlinear terms, paving the way to conduct iISS assessment for general nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems within the Lyapunov stability framework. Then, by using the comparison principles, we prove a local {iISS} {(LiISS)} Lyapunov theorem for the nonlinear non-autonomous infinite-dimensional systems in the framework of Banach spaces. {Furthermore,} we provide sufficient conditions of the existence of a local iISS Lyapunonv functional (LiISS-LF) and construct LiISS-LFs for the systems in the framework of Hilbert spaces. Finally, we preset two examples to illustrate the proposed {Lyapunov} method for the LiISS analysis: one is to show how to obtain the LiISS of a nonlinear finite-dimensional system with time-varying coefficients and superlinear terms under linear state feedback control law while another one is to show how to employ the interpolation inequalities to handle superliner terms and establish the LiISS-LF for a class of multi-dimensional parabolic equations with space-time-varying coefficients. To demonstrate the validity of the results, numerical experiments are also conducted to verify the LiISS of these two classes of systems.

Title: Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter for Legged Robot State Estimation
Authors: Kyung-Hwan Kim, DongHyun Ahn, Dong-hyun Lee, JuYoung Yoon, Dong Jin Hyun
Abstract: State estimation is crucial for legged robots as it directly affects control performance and locomotion stability. In this paper, we propose an Adaptive Invariant Extended Kalman Filter to improve proprioceptive state estimation for legged robots. The proposed method adaptively adjusts the noise level of the contact foot model based on online covariance estimation, leading to improved state estimation under varying contact conditions. It effectively handles small slips that traditional slip rejection fails to address, as overly sensitive slip rejection settings risk causing filter divergence. Our approach employs a contact detection algorithm instead of contact sensors, reducing the reliance on additional hardware. The proposed method is validated through real-world experiments on the quadruped robot LeoQuad, demonstrating enhanced state estimation performance in dynamic locomotion scenarios.

Title: End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act
Authors: Siyin Wang, Wenyi Yu, Xianzhao Chen, Xiaohai Tian, Jun Zhang, Lu Lu, Chao Zhang
Abstract: Human interaction is inherently multimodal and full-duplex: we listen while watching, speak while acting, and fluidly adapt to turn-taking and interruptions. Realizing these capabilities is essential for building models simulating humans. We present ELLSA (End-to-end Listen, Look, Speak and Act), which, to our knowledge, is the first full-duplex, end-to-end model that simultaneously perceives and generates across vision, text, speech, and action within a single architecture, enabling interaction patterns previously out of reach, yielding more natural, human-like behaviors. At its core is a novel SA-MoE architecture (Self-Attention Mixture-of-Experts) that routes each modality to specialized experts and fuses them through a unified attention backbone. This provides a generalizable solution for joint multimodal perception and concurrent generation, leveraging strong pre-trained components while enabling efficient modality integration and mitigating modality interference. On speech-interaction and robot-manipulation benchmarks, ELLSA matches modality-specific baselines, while uniquely supporting advanced multimodal and full-duplex behaviors such as dialogue and action turn-taking, defective instruction rejection, speaking-while-acting, context-grounded visual question answering, and action barge-ins. We contend that ELLSA represents a step toward more natural and general interactive intelligence, contributing to the broader pursuit of artificial general intelligence. All data, code and model checkpoints will be released upon acceptance.

Title: Schrödinger Bridge Mamba for One-Step Speech Enhancement
Authors: Jing Yang, Sirui Wang, Chao Wu, Fan Fan
Abstract: We propose Schrödinger Bridge Mamba (SBM), a new concept of training-inference framework motivated by the inherent compatibility between Schrödinger Bridge (SB) training paradigm and selective state-space model Mamba. We exemplify the concept of SBM with an implementation for generative speech enhancement. Experiments on a joint denoising and dereverberation task using four benchmark datasets demonstrate that SBM, with only 1-step inference, outperforms strong baselines with 1-step or iterative inference and achieves the best real-time factor (RTF). Beyond speech enhancement, we discuss the integration of SB paradigm and selective state-space model architecture based on their underlying alignment, which indicates a promising direction for exploring new deep generative models potentially applicable to a broad range of generative tasks.

Title: Investigating Safety Vulnerabilities of Large Audio-Language Models Under Speaker Emotional Variations
Authors: Bo-Han Feng, Chien-Feng Liu, Yu-Hsuan Li Liang, Chih-Kai Yang, Szu-Wei Fu, Zhehuai Chen, Ke-Han Lu, Sung-Feng Huang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Yun-Nung Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Large audio-language models (LALMs) extend text-based LLMs with auditory understanding, offering new opportunities for multimodal applications. While their perception, reasoning, and task performance have been widely studied, their safety alignment under paralinguistic variation remains underexplored. This work systematically investigates the role of speaker emotion. We construct a dataset of malicious speech instructions expressed across multiple emotions and intensities, and evaluate several state-of-the-art LALMs. Our results reveal substantial safety inconsistencies: different emotions elicit varying levels of unsafe responses, and the effect of intensity is non-monotonic, with medium expressions often posing the greatest risk. These findings highlight an overlooked vulnerability in LALMs and call for alignment strategies explicitly designed to ensure robustness under emotional variation, a prerequisite for trustworthy deployment in real-world settings.

Title: SAKE: Towards Editing Auditory Attribute Knowledge of Large Audio-Language Models
Authors: Chih-Kai Yang, Yen-Ting Piao, Tzu-Wen Hsu, Szu-Wei Fu, Zhehuai Chen, Ke-Han Lu, Sung-Feng Huang, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Yu-Chiang Frank Wang, Yun-Nung Chen, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: Knowledge editing offers an efficient way to update model knowledge without full retraining, but prior work has concentrated almost exclusively on textual or visual modalities. We introduce SAKE, the first benchmark specifically designed for editing auditory attribute knowledge in Large Audio-Language Models (LALMs). Unlike factual updates, SAKE targets several abstract auditory attributes, capturing knowledge types that go beyond conventional textual and visual domains. We benchmark seven editing methods on two LALMs along four dimensions: reliability, generality, audio/text locality, and portability. Results highlight challenges such as preserving intra-attribute knowledge unrelated to the edit, generalizing edits to multimodal reasoning, and maintaining edits under sequential updates. SAKE provides a principled framework to study how knowledge editing extends to the auditory modalities, opening new directions for maintaining and adapting LALMs in more diverse real-world scenarios.

Title: Ultra High Sensitivity Soil Moisture Detection Using Photonic Crystal Cavity with SIW Technology
Authors: Justin Jose, Nikhil Kumar
Abstract: Soil nutrients and water content are two crucial factors that significantly affect agricultural production yields. Hence, monitoring and measuring the water content and soil type are critical requirements. This study proposes a two-dimensional structure of photonic crystals centered around a symmetrical cross-shaped slot. The cross-slots act as resonators, and the photonic crystals surrounding the slots tune the resonance frequency of the resonators to enhance mode confinement within the resonator. The various resonant modes are located in the 2.1 GHz, 5.2 GHz, and 8.1 GHz bands, which correspond to the S band, C band, and X band, respectively. These bands are used to compare the absorption, whereas the upper resonant mode is of the order of 20 GHz. Band structure analysis was performed using the Plane Wave Method (PWM). The resonant frequency is computed using a 3D electromagnetic (EM) simulation software that utilizes the Finite Element Method (FEM) and lies in the radiation mode region of the band structure of the photonic crystal. Varying the incident angle had a negligible effect on the absorption characteristics of the sensor, allowing it to produce accurate sensing results regardless of the incident angle. The sensor's sensitivity is maximized using this design, which results in a sensitivity of 85.4 % in the 2.1 GHz resonant frequency, which is much higher than that of a single column of photonic crystal-based SIW, resulting in 50.6 % of sensitivity at 2.1 GHz, at which there is a frequency shift of the order of GHz. In contrast, in the proposed design, the frequency shift is on the order of MHz, resulting in ultra-high sensitivity.

Title: A Primer on Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for Probabilistic Time Series Forecasting
Authors: Cristian J. Vaca-Rubio, Roberto Pereira, Luis Blanco, Engin Zeydan, Màrius Caus
Abstract: This work introduces Probabilistic Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (P-KAN), a novel probabilistic extension of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) for time series forecasting. By replacing scalar weights with spline-based functional connections and directly parameterizing predictive distributions, P-KANs offer expressive yet parameter-efficient models capable of capturing nonlinear and heavy-tailed dynamics. We evaluate P-KANs on satellite traffic forecasting, where uncertainty-aware predictions enable dynamic thresholding for resource allocation. Results show that P-KANs consistently outperform Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP) baselines in both accuracy and calibration, achieving superior efficiency-risk trade-offs while using significantly fewer parameters. We build up P-KANs on two distributions, namely Gaussian and Student-t distributions. The Gaussian variant provides robust, conservative forecasts suitable for safety-critical scenarios, whereas the Student-t variant yields sharper distributions that improve efficiency under stable demand. These findings establish P-KANs as a powerful framework for probabilistic forecasting with direct applicability to satellite communications and other resource-constrained domains.

Title: Unlocking Off-the-Grid Sparse Recovery with Unlimited Sensing: Simultaneous Super-Resolution in Time and Amplitude
Authors: Ruiming Guo, Ayush Bhandari
Abstract: The recovery of Dirac impulses, or spikes, from filtered measurements is a classical problem in signal processing. As the spikes lie in the continuous domain while measurements are discrete, this task is known as super-resolution or off-the-grid sparse recovery. Despite significant theoretical and algorithmic advances over the past decade, these developments often overlook critical challenges at the analog-digital interface. In particular, when spikes exhibit strong-weak amplitude disparity, conventional digital acquisition may result in clipping of strong components or loss of weak ones beneath the quantization noise floor. This motivates a broader perspective: super-resolution must simultaneously resolve both amplitude and temporal structure. Under a fixed bit budget, such information loss is unavoidable. In contrast, the emerging theory and practice of the Unlimited Sensing Framework (USF) demonstrate that these fundamental limitations can be overcome. Building on this foundation, we demonstrate that modulo encoding within USF enables digital super-resolution by enhancing measurement precision, thereby unlocking temporal super-resolution beyond conventional limits. We develop new theoretical results that extend to non-bandlimited kernels commonly encountered in practice and introduce a robust algorithm for off-the-grid sparse recovery. To demonstrate practical impact, we instantiate our framework in the context of time-of-flight imaging. Both numerical simulations and hardware experiments validate the effectiveness of our approach under low-bit quantization, enabling super-resolution in amplitude and time.

Title: Traffic Prioritization Mechanisms for Mission and Time Critical Applications in Industrial Internet of Things
Authors: Anwar Ahmed Khan, Shama Siddiqui, Indrakshi Dey
Abstract: Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) promises to revolutionize industrial operations and productions through utilizing Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communications. Since each node in such environments generates various types of data with diverse service requirements, MAC protocol holds crucial importance to ensure efficient delivery. In this context, simple to complex MAC schemes are found in literature. This paper focuses on evaluating the performance of two major techniques "slot stealing" and "packet fragmentation" for the IIoT; representative protocols SS-MAC and FROG-MAC have been chosen from each category respectively. We conducted realistic simulations for the two protocols using Contiki. Delay and packet loss comparison for SS-MAC and FROG-MAC indicates the superiority of FROG-MAC due to reduction in the waiting time for urgent traffic. Thus, a simple fragmentation scheme could be deployed for efficient scheduling of heterogenous traffic in the industrial environments.

Title: Person Re-Identification via Generalized Class Prototypes
Authors: Md Ahmed Al Muzaddid, William J. Beksi
Abstract: Advanced feature extraction methods have significantly contributed to enhancing the task of person re-identification. In addition, modifications to objective functions have been developed to further improve performance. Nonetheless, selecting better class representatives is an underexplored area of research that can also lead to advancements in re-identification performance. Although past works have experimented with using the centroid of a gallery image class during training, only a few have investigated alternative representations during the retrieval stage. In this paper, we demonstrate that these prior techniques yield suboptimal results in terms of re-identification metrics. To address the re-identification problem, we propose a generalized selection method that involves choosing representations that are not limited to class centroids. Our approach strikes a balance between accuracy and mean average precision, leading to improvements beyond the state of the art. For example, the actual number of representations per class can be adjusted to meet specific application requirements. We apply our methodology on top of multiple re-identification embeddings, and in all cases it substantially improves upon contemporary results

Title: Quantum Key Distribution for Virtual Power Plant Communication: A Lightweight Key-Aware Scheduler with Provable Stability
Authors: Ziqing Zhu
Abstract: Virtual power plants (VPPs) are becoming a cornerstone of future grids, aggregating distributed PV, wind, storage, and flexible loads for market participation and real-time balancing. As operations move to minute-- and second--level feedback, communication security shifts from a compliance item to an operational constraint: latency, reliability, and confidentiality jointly determine whether dispatch, protection, and settlement signals arrive on time. Conventional PKI and key-rotation schemes struggle with cross-domain, high-frequency messaging and face long-term quantum threats. Quantum key distribution (QKD) offers information-theoretic key freshness, but its key yield is scarce and stochastic, often misaligned with bursty VPP traffic. This paper proposes a key-aware priority and quota framework that treats quantum keys as first-class scheduling resources. The design combines (i) forecast-driven long-term quotas and short-term tokens, (ii) key-aware deficit-round-robin arbitration, (iii) a preemptive emergency key reserve, and (iv) graceful degradation via encryption-mode switching and controlled down-sampling for non-critical traffic. A drift-plus-penalty analysis establishes strong stability under average supply--demand balance with quantifiable bounds on backlog and tail latency, providing interpretable operating guarantees. We build a reproducible testbed on IEEE 33- and 123-bus VPP systems and evaluate normal, degraded, and outage regimes with industry-consistent message classes and TTLs. Against FIFO, fixed-priority, and static-quota baselines, the proposed scheme consistently reduces tail delay and passive timeouts for critical messages, improves per-bit key utility, and enhances power-tracking reliability during key scarcity and regime switches.

Title: Channel Capacity for FMCW-based Optical Wireless Integrated Sensing and Communication: Asymptotic Analysis and Envelope Design
Authors: Yunfeng Wen, Fang Yang, Jian Song, Zhu Han
Abstract: Optical wireless integrated sensing and communication (OW-ISAC) is rapidly burgeoning as a complement and augmentation to its radio-frequency counterpart. In this paper, the channel capacity is analyzed to guide the design of a coherent OW-ISAC system based on frequency-modulated continuous wave (FMCW). Firstly, the system model of FMCW-based OW-ISAC is recast into an information-theoretic formulation, where an additional harmonic-mean constraint is imposed to ensure the sensing performance. Subsequently, both lower and upper bounds for channel capacity are derived under the imposed sensing constraint, based on which asymptotic expressions for channel capacity are presented for both low and high signal-to-noise-ratio regions. Moreover, the analysis of channel capacity provides guidance for the envelope design based on pulse amplitude modulation, whose capacity-achieving capabilities are demonstrated by numerical results. Furthermore, simulations reveal the trade-off between communication and sensing functionalities. In summary, the analysis of channel capacity under the sensing constraint provides insights into both the optimality and the practicality of OW-ISAC design.

Title: Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks
Authors: Lucas Schulze, Juliano Decico Negri, Victor Barasuol, Vivian Suzano Medeiros, Marcelo Becker, Jan Peters, Oleg Arenz
Abstract: Grey-box methods for system identification combine deep learning with physics-informed constraints, capturing complex dependencies while improving out-of-distribution generalization. Yet, despite the growing importance of floating-base systems such as humanoids and quadrupeds, current grey-box models ignore their specific physical constraints. For instance, the inertia matrix is not only positive definite but also exhibits branch-induced sparsity and input independence. Moreover, the 6x6 composite spatial inertia of the floating base inherits properties of single-rigid-body inertia matrices. As we show, this includes the triangle inequality on the eigenvalues of the composite rotational inertia. To address the lack of physical consistency in deep learning models of floating-base systems, we introduce a parameterization of inertia matrices that satisfies all these constraints. Inspired by Deep Lagrangian Networks (DeLaN), we train neural networks to predict physically plausible inertia matrices that minimize inverse dynamics error under Lagrangian mechanics. For evaluation, we collected and released a dataset on multiple quadrupeds and humanoids. In these experiments, our Floating-Base Deep Lagrangian Networks (FeLaN) achieve highly competitive performance on both simulated and real robots, while providing greater physical interpretability.

Title: Breaking and Fixing Defenses Against Control-Flow Hijacking in Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Rishi Jha, Harold Triedman, Justin Wagle, Vitaly Shmatikov
Abstract: Control-flow hijacking attacks manipulate orchestration mechanisms in multi-agent systems into performing unsafe actions that compromise the system and exfiltrate sensitive information. Recently proposed defenses, such as LlamaFirewall, rely on alignment checks of inter-agent communications to ensure that all agent invocations are "related to" and "likely to further" the original objective. We start by demonstrating control-flow hijacking attacks that evade these defenses even if alignment checks are performed by advanced LLMs. We argue that the safety and functionality objectives of multi-agent systems fundamentally conflict with each other. This conflict is exacerbated by the brittle definitions of "alignment" and the checkers' incomplete visibility into the execution context. We then propose, implement, and evaluate ControlValve, a new defense inspired by the principles of control-flow integrity and least privilege. ControlValve (1) generates permitted control-flow graphs for multi-agent systems, and (2) enforces that all executions comply with these graphs, along with contextual rules (generated in a zero-shot manner) for each agent invocation.

Title: A polynomial-based QCQP solver for encrypted optimization
Authors: Sebastian Schlor, Andrea Iannelli, Junsoo Kim, Hyungbo Shim, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: In this paper, we present a novel method for solving a class of quadratically constrained quadratic optimization problems using only additions and multiplications. This approach enables solving constrained optimization problems on private data since the operations involved are compatible with the capabilities of homomorphic encryption schemes. To solve the constrained optimization problem, a sequence of polynomial penalty functions of increasing degree is introduced, which are sufficiently steep at the boundary of the feasible set. Adding the penalty function to the original cost function creates a sequence of unconstrained optimization problems whose minimizer always lies in the admissible set and converges to the minimizer of the constrained problem. A gradient descent method is used to generate a sequence of iterates associated with these problems. For the algorithm, it is shown that the iterate converges to a minimizer of the original problem, and the feasible set is positively invariant under the iteration. Finally, the method is demonstrated on an illustrative cryptographic problem, finding the smaller value of two numbers, and the encrypted implementability is discussed.

Title: Assessing the Quality of a Set of Basis Functions for Inverse Optimal Control via Projection onto Global Minimizers
Authors: Filip Bečanović, Jared Miller, Vincent Bonnet, Kosta Jovanović, Samer Mohammed
Abstract: Inverse optimization (Inverse optimal control) is the task of imputing a cost function such that given test points (trajectories) are (nearly) optimal with respect to the discovered cost. Prior methods in inverse optimization assume that the true cost is a convex combination of a set of convex basis functions and that this basis is consistent with the test points. However, the consistency assumption is not always justified, as in many applications the principles by which the data is generated are not well understood. This work proposes using the distance between a test point and the set of global optima generated by the convex combinations of the convex basis functions as a measurement for the expressive quality of the basis with respect to the test point. A large minimal distance invalidates the set of basis functions. The concept of a set of global optima is introduced and its properties are explored in unconstrained and constrained settings. Upper and lower bounds for the minimum distance in the convex quadratic setting are implemented by bi-level gradient descent and an enriched linear matrix inequality respectively. Extensions to this framework include max-representable basis functions, nonconvex basis functions (local minima), and applying polynomial optimization techniques.

Title: RINS-T: Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems
Authors: Keivan Faghih Niresi, Zepeng Zhang, Olga Fink
Abstract: Time series data are often affected by various forms of corruption, such as missing values, noise, and outliers, which pose significant challenges for tasks such as forecasting and anomaly detection. To address these issues, inverse problems focus on reconstructing the original signal from corrupted data by leveraging prior knowledge about its underlying structure. While deep learning methods have demonstrated potential in this domain, they often require extensive pretraining and struggle to generalize under distribution shifts. In this work, we propose RINS-T (Robust Implicit Neural Solvers for Time Series Linear Inverse Problems), a novel deep prior framework that achieves high recovery performance without requiring pretraining data. RINS-T leverages neural networks as implicit priors and integrates robust optimization techniques, making it resilient to outliers while relaxing the reliance on Gaussian noise assumptions. To further improve optimization stability and robustness, we introduce three key innovations: guided input initialization, input perturbation, and convex output combination techniques. Each of these contributions strengthens the framework's optimization stability and robustness. These advancements make RINS-T a flexible and effective solution for addressing complex real-world time series challenges. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Process Automation Architecture Using RFID for Transparent Voting Systems
Authors: Stella N. Arinze, Patrick U. Okafor, Onyekachi M. Egwuagu, Augustine O. Nwajana
Abstract: This paper presents the development of a process automation architecture leveraging Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) technology for secure, transparent and efficient voting systems. The proposed architecture automates the voting workflow through RFID-enabled voter identification, encrypted vote casting, and secure data transmission. Each eligible voter receives a smart RFID card containing a uniquely encrypted identifier, which is verified using an RC522 reader interfaced with a microcontroller. Upon successful verification, the voter interacts with a touchscreen interface to cast a vote, which is then encrypted using AES-128 and securely stored on a local SD card or transmitted via GSM to a central server. A tamper-proof monitoring mechanism records each session with time-stamped digital signatures, ensuring auditability and data integrity. The architecture is designed to function in both online and offline modes, with an automated batch synchronization mechanism that updates vote records once network connectivity is restored. System testing in simulated environments confirmed 100% voter authentication accuracy, minimized latency (average voting time of 11.5 seconds), and robustness against cloning, double voting, and data interception. The integration of real-time monitoring and secure process control modules enables electoral authorities to automate data logging, detect anomalies, and validate system integrity dynamically. This work demonstrates a scalable, automation-driven solution for voting infrastructure, offering enhanced transparency, resilience, and deployment flexibility, especially in environments where digital transformation of electoral processes is critically needed.

Title: S4ECG: Exploring the impact of long-range interactions for arrhythmia prediction
Authors: Tiezhi Wang, Wilhelm Haverkamp, Nils Strodthoff
Abstract: The electrocardiogram (ECG) exemplifies biosignal-based time series with continuous, temporally ordered structure reflecting cardiac physiological and pathophysiological dynamics. Detailed analysis of these dynamics has proven challenging, as conventional methods capture either global trends or local waveform features but rarely their simultaneous interplay at high temporal resolution. To bridge global and local signal analysis, we introduce S4ECG, a novel deep learning architecture leveraging structured state space models for multi-epoch arrhythmia classification. Our joint multi-epoch predictions significantly outperform single-epoch approaches by 1.0-11.6% in macro-AUROC, with atrial fibrillation specificity improving from 0.718-0.979 to 0.967-0.998, demonstrating superior performance in-distribution and enhanced out-of-distribution robustness. Systematic investigation reveals optimal temporal dependency windows spanning 10-20 minutes for peak performance. This work contributes to a paradigm shift toward temporally-aware arrhythmia detection algorithms, opening new possibilities for ECG interpretation, in particular for complex arrhythmias like atrial fibrillation and atrial flutter.

Title: Integrating Trustworthy Artificial Intelligence with Energy-Efficient Robotic Arms for Waste Sorting
Authors: Halima I. Kure, Jishna Retnakumari, Augustine O. Nwajana, Umar M. Ismail, Bilyaminu A. Romo, Ehigiator Egho-Promise
Abstract: This paper presents a novel methodology that integrates trustworthy artificial intelligence (AI) with an energy-efficient robotic arm for intelligent waste classification and sorting. By utilizing a convolutional neural network (CNN) enhanced through transfer learning with MobileNetV2, the system accurately classifies waste into six categories: plastic, glass, metal, paper, cardboard, and trash. The model achieved a high training accuracy of 99.8% and a validation accuracy of 80.5%, demonstrating strong learning and generalization. A robotic arm simulator is implemented to perform virtual sorting, calculating the energy cost for each action using Euclidean distance to ensure optimal and efficient movement. The framework incorporates key elements of trustworthy AI, such as transparency, robustness, fairness, and safety, making it a reliable and scalable solution for smart waste management systems in urban settings.

Title: Inverse Optimal Control of Muscle Force Sharing During Pathological Gait
Authors: Filip Bečanović, Vincent Bonnet, Kosta Jovanović, Samer Mohammed, Raphaël Dumas
Abstract: Muscle force sharing is typically resolved by minimizing a specific objective function to approximate neural control strategies. An inverse optimal control approach was applied to identify the "best" objective function, among a positive linear combination of basis objective functions, associated with the gait of two post-stroke males, one high-functioning (subject S1) and one low-functioning (subject S2). It was found that the "best" objective function is subject- and leg-specific. No single function works universally well, yet the best options are usually differently weighted combinations of muscle activation- and power-minimization. Subject-specific inverse optimal control models performed best on their respective limbs (\textbf{RMSE 178/213 N, CC 0.71/0.61} for non-paretic and paretic legs of S1; \textbf{RMSE 205/165 N, CC 0.88/0.85} for respective legs of S2), but cross-subject generalization was poor, particularly for paretic legs. Moreover, minimizing the root mean square of muscle power emerged as important for paretic limbs, while minimizing activation-based functions dominated for non-paretic limbs. This may suggest different neural control strategies between affected and unaffected sides, possibly altered by the presence of spasticity. Among the 15 considered objective functions commonly used in inverse dynamics-based computations, the root mean square of muscle power was the only one explicitly incorporating muscle velocity, leading to a possible model for spasticity in the paretic limbs. Although this objective function has been rarely used, it may be relevant for modeling pathological gait, such as post-stroke gait.

Title: A condensing approach for linear-quadratic optimization with geometric constraints
Authors: Alberto De Marchi
Abstract: Optimization problems with convex quadratic cost and polyhedral constraints are ubiquitous in signal processing, automatic control and decision-making. We consider here an enlarged problem class that allows to encode logical conditions and cardinality constraints, among others. In particular, we cover also situations where parts of the constraints are nonconvex and possibly complicated, but it is practical to compute projections onto this nonconvex set. Our approach combines the augmented Lagrangian framework with a solver-agnostic structure-exploiting subproblem reformulation. While convergence guarantees follow from the former, the proposed condensing technique leads to significant improvements in computational performance.

Title: Delay-Doppler Pulse Shaping in Zak-OTFS Using Hermite Basis Functions
Authors: Fathima Jesbin, Ananthanarayanan Chockalingam
Abstract: The performance of Zak-OTFS modulation is critically dependent on the choice of the delay-Doppler (DD) domain pulse shaping filter. The design of pulses for $L^2(\mathbb{R})$ is constrained by the Balian-Low Theorem, which imposes an inescapable trade-off between time-frequency localization and orthogonality for spectrally efficient systems. In Zak-OTFS, this trade-off requires balancing the need for localization for input/output (I/O) relation estimation with the need for orthogonality for reliable data detection when operating without time or bandwidth expansion. The well-known sinc and Gaussian pulse shapes represent the canonical extremes of this trade-off, while composite constructions such as the Gaussian-sinc (GS) pulse shape offer a good compromise. In this work, we propose a systematic DD pulse design framework for Zak-OTFS that expresses the pulse as a linear combination of Hermite basis functions. We obtain the optimal coefficients for the Hermite basis functions that minimize the inter-symbol interference (ISI) energy at the DD sampling points by solving a constrained optimization problem via singular value decomposition. For the proposed class of Hermite pulses, we derive closed-form expressions for the I/O relation and noise covariance in Zak-OTFS. Simulation results of Zak-OTFS with embedded pilot and model-free I/O relation estimation in Vehicular-A channels with fractional DDs demonstrate that the optimized pulse shape achieves a bit error rate performance that is significantly superior compared to those of the canonical sinc and Gaussian pulses and is on par with that of the state-of-the-art GS pulse, validating the proposed framework which provides greater design flexibility in terms of control of ISI and sidelobe energies.

Title: Reliable Inference in Edge-Cloud Model Cascades via Conformal Alignment
Authors: Jiayi Huang, Sangwoo Park, Nicola Paoletti, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Edge intelligence enables low-latency inference via compact on-device models, but assuring reliability remains challenging. We study edge-cloud cascades that must preserve conditional coverage: whenever the edge returns a prediction set, it should contain the true label with a user-specified probability, as if produced by the cloud model. We formalize conditional coverage with respect to the cloud predictive distribution, and introduce a conformal alignment-based (CAb) cascading mechanism that certifies this property with user control over the risk level. Our method casts escalation from edge to cloud models as a multiple-hypothesis testing (MHT) problem, tailoring conformal alignment (CA) to select which inputs can be safely handled at the edge. The proposed CAb model cascading method yields statistical guarantees on the average fraction of edge decisions that satisfy cloud-level conditional coverage. The procedure applies to arbitrary edge prediction sets, including variants of conformal prediction (CP), and exposes a tunable trade-off among coverage, deferral rate, and set size. Experiments on CIFAR-100 image classification and the TeleQnA question-answering (QA) benchmark show that the proposed CAb cascade maintains the target conditional coverage for edge predictions while substantially reducing offloading to the cloud and incurring modest increases in prediction-set size.

Title: An Empirical Study of Lagrangian Methods in Safe Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Lindsay Spoor, Álvaro Serra-Gómez, Aske Plaat, Thomas Moerland
Abstract: In safety-critical domains such as robotics, navigation and power systems, constrained optimization problems arise where maximizing performance must be carefully balanced with associated constraints. Safe reinforcement learning provides a framework to address these challenges, with Lagrangian methods being a popular choice. However, the effectiveness of Lagrangian methods crucially depends on the choice of the Lagrange multiplier $\lambda$, which governs the trade-off between return and constraint cost. A common approach is to update the multiplier automatically during training. Although this is standard in practice, there remains limited empirical evidence on the robustness of an automated update and its influence on overall performance. Therefore, we analyze (i) optimality and (ii) stability of Lagrange multipliers in safe reinforcement learning across a range of tasks. We provide $\lambda$-profiles that give a complete visualization of the trade-off between return and constraint cost of the optimization problem. These profiles show the highly sensitive nature of $\lambda$ and moreover confirm the lack of general intuition for choosing the optimal value $\lambda^*$. Our findings additionally show that automated multiplier updates are able to recover and sometimes even exceed the optimal performance found at $\lambda^*$ due to the vast difference in their learning trajectories. Furthermore, we show that automated multiplier updates exhibit oscillatory behavior during training, which can be mitigated through PID-controlled updates. However, this method requires careful tuning to achieve consistently better performance across tasks. This highlights the need for further research on stabilizing Lagrangian methods in safe reinforcement learning. The code used to reproduce our results can be found at this https URL.

Title: AutoLungDx: A Hybrid Deep Learning Approach for Early Lung Cancer Diagnosis Using 3D Res-U-Net, YOLOv5, and Vision Transformers
Authors: Samiul Based Shuvo, Tasnia Binte Mamun
Abstract: Lung cancer is a leading cause of cancer-related deaths worldwide, and early detection is crucial for improving patient outcomes. Nevertheless, early diagnosis of cancer is a major challenge, particularly in low-resource settings where access to medical resources and trained radiologists is limited. The objective of this study is to propose an automated end-to-end deep learning-based framework for the early detection and classification of lung nodules, specifically for low-resource settings. The proposed framework consists of three stages: lung segmentation using a modified 3D U-Net named 3D Res-U-Net, nodule detection using YOLO-v5, and classification with a Vision Transformer-based architecture. We evaluated the proposed framework on a publicly available dataset, LUNA16. The proposed framework's performance was measured using the respective domain's evaluation matrices. The proposed framework achieved a 98.82% lung segmentation dice score while detecting the lung nodule with 0.76 mAP@50 from the segmented lung, at a low false-positive rate. The performance of both networks of the proposed framework was compared with other studies and found to outperform them regarding segmentation and detection accuracy. Additionally, our proposed Vision transformer network obtained an accuracy of 93.57%, which is 1.21% higher than the state-of-the-art networks. Our proposed end-to-end deep learning-based framework can effectively segment lungs, and detect and classify lung nodules, specifically in low-resource settings with limited access to radiologists. The proposed framework outperforms existing studies regarding all the respective evaluation metrics. The proposed framework can potentially improve the accuracy and efficiency of lung cancer screening in low-resource settings, ultimately leading to better patient outcomes.

Title: FlipDyn with Control: Resource Takeover Games with Dynamics
Authors: Sandeep Banik, Shaunak D. Bopardikar
Abstract: We introduce FlipDyn with control, a finite-horizon zero-sum resource takeover game, where a defender and an adversary decide when to takeover and how to control a common resource. At each discrete-time step, the players can take over or retain control, incurring state and control-dependent costs. The system is modeled as a hybrid dynamical system, with a discrete \texttt{FlipDyn} state determining control authority. Our contributions are: (i) For arbitrary non-negative costs, we derive the saddle-point value of the \texttt{FlipDyn} game and the corresponding Nash equilibria (NE) takeover strategies. (ii) For linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we establish sufficient conditions under which the game admits an NE. (iii) For scalar linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive parameterized NE takeover strategies and saddle-point values independent of the continuous state. (iv) For higher-dimensional linear dynamical systems with quadratic costs, we derive approximate NE takeover strategies and control policies, and compute bounds on the saddle-point values. We validate our results through a numerical study on adversarial control of a linear system.

Title: Predicting Patient Recovery or Mortality Using Deep Neural Decision Tree and Forest
Authors: Mohammad Dehghani, Mohadeseh Zarei Ghobadi, Mobin Mohammadi, Diyana Tehrany Dehkordy
Abstract: Objective: Identifying patients at high risk of mortality is crucial for emergency physicians to allocate hospital resources effectively, particularly in regions with limited medical services. This need becomes even more pressing during global health crises that lead to significant morbidity and mortality. This study aimed to present the usability deep neural decision forest and deep neural decision tree to predict mortality among Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) patients. To this end, We used patient data encompassing Coronavirus disease 2019 diagnosis, demographics, health indicators, and occupational risk factors to analyze disease severity and outcomes. The dataset was partitioned using a stratified sampling method, ensuring that 80% was allocated for training and 20% for testing. Nine machine learning and deep learning methods were employed to build predictive models. The models were evaluated across all stages to determine their effectiveness in predicting patient outcomes. Results: Among the models, the deep neural decision forest consistently outperformed others. Results indicated that using only clinical data yielded an accuracy of 80% by deep neural decision forest, demonstrating it as a reliable predictor of patient mortality. Moreover, the results suggest that clinical data alone may be the most accurate diagnostic tool for predicting mortality.

Title: A Closed-Form Solution for Kernel Adaptive Filtering
Authors: Benjamin Colburn, Luis G. Sanchez Giraldo, Kan Li, Jose C. Principe
Abstract: Unlike the conventional kernel adaptive filtering (KAF) approach of using a fixed kernel to define the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space (RKHS), this paper embeds the statistics of the input data in the kernel definition, obtaining a closed-form solution for nonlinear adaptive filtering. We call this solution the Functional Wiener Filter (FWF), and it is formally an extension of Parzen's work on the autocorrelation RKHS to nonlinear functional spaces. We present a method for approximating the FWF in an explicit, finite-dimensional RKHS to model time series directly from realizations, which is less computationally demanding at test time than other KAF methods. We show that FWF outperforms KAF on a synthetic dataset that meets the conditions of the theory, and is comparable to other KAF algorithms for both a chaotic and real-world time series. We demonstrate how the difference equation learned by the FWF can be extracted, leading to possible applications in system identification.

Title: Adaptive Convolutional Neural Network for Image Super-resolution
Authors: Ziang Wu, Jinwei Xie, Xuanyu Zhang, Tao Wang, Yongjun Zhang, Qi Zhu, Chunwei Tian
Abstract: Convolutional neural networks can automatically learn features via deep network architectures and given input samples. However, the robustness of obtained models may face challenges in varying scenes. Bigger differences in network architecture are beneficial to extract more diversified structural information to strengthen the robustness of an obtained super-resolution model. In this paper, we proposed a adaptive convolutional neural network for image super-resolution (ADSRNet). To capture more information, ADSRNet is implemented by a heterogeneous parallel network. The upper network can enhance relation of context information, salient information relation of a kernel mapping and relations of shallow and deep layers to improve performance of image super-resolution. That can strengthen adaptability of an obtained super-resolution model for different scenes. The lower network utilizes a symmetric architecture to enhance relations of different layers to mine more structural information, which is complementary with a upper network for image super-resolution. The relevant experimental results show that the proposed ADSRNet is effective to deal with image resolving. Codes are obtained at this https URL.

Title: A Self-Attention-Driven Deep Denoiser Model for Real Time Lung Sound Denoising in Noisy Environments
Authors: Samiul Based Shuvo, Syed Samiul Alam, Taufiq Hasan
Abstract: Objective: Lung auscultation is a valuable tool in diagnosing and monitoring various respiratory diseases. However, lung sounds (LS) are significantly affected by numerous sources of contamination, especially when recorded in real-world clinical settings. Conventional denoising models prove impractical for LS denoising, primarily owing to spectral overlap complexities arising from diverse noise sources. To address this issue, we propose a specialized deep-learning model (Uformer) for lung sound denoising. Methods: The proposed Uformer model is constituted of three modules: a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) encoder module, dedicated to extracting latent features; a Transformer encoder module, employed to further enhance the encoding of unique LS features and effectively capture intricate long-range dependencies; and a CNN decoder module, employed to generate the denoised signals. An ablation study was performed in order to find the most optimal architecture. Results: The performance of the proposed Uformer model was evaluated on lung sounds induced with different types of synthetic and real-world noises. Lung sound signals of -12 dB to 15 dB signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) were considered in testing experiments. The proposed model showed an average SNR improvement of 16.51 dB when evaluated with -12 dB LS signals. Our end-to-end model, with an average SNR improvement of 19.31 dB, outperforms the existing model when evaluated with ambient noise and fewer parameters. Conclusion: Based on the qualitative and quantitative findings in this study, it can be stated that Uformer is robust and generalized to be used in assisting the monitoring of respiratory conditions.

Title: Interacting Particle Systems for Fast Linear Quadratic RL
Authors: Anant A Joshi, Heng-Sheng Chang, Amirhossein Taghvaei, Prashant G Mehta, Sean P. Meyn
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the design of algorithms based on systems of interacting particles to represent, approximate, and learn the optimal control law for reinforcement learning (RL). The primary contribution is that convergence rates are greatly accelerated by the interactions between particles. Theory focuses on the linear quadratic stochastic optimal control problem for which a complete and novel theory is presented. Apart from the new algorithm, sample complexity bounds are obtained, and it is shown that the mean square error scales as $1/N$ where $N$ is the number of particles. The theoretical results and algorithms are illustrated with numerical experiments and comparisons with other recent approaches, where the faster convergence of the proposed algorithm is numerically demonstrated.

Title: Principled Feature Disentanglement for High-Fidelity Unified Brain MRI Synthesis
Authors: Jihoon Cho, Jonghye Woo, Jinah Park
Abstract: Multisequence Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) provides a more reliable diagnosis in clinical applications through complementary information across sequences. However, in practice, the absence of certain MR sequences is a common problem that can lead to inconsistent analysis results. In this work, we propose a novel unified framework for synthesizing multisequence MR images, called hybrid-fusion GAN (HF-GAN). The fundamental mechanism of this work is principled feature disentanglement, which aligns the design of the architecture with the complexity of the features. A powerful many-to-one stream is constructed for the extraction of complex complementary features, while utilizing parallel, one-to-one streams to process modality-specific information. These disentangled features are dynamically integrated into a common latent space by a channel attention-based fusion module (CAFF) and then transformed via a modality infuser to generate the target sequence. We validated our framework on public datasets of both healthy and pathological brain MRI. Quantitative and qualitative results show that HF-GAN achieves state-of-the-art performance, with our 2D slice-based framework notably outperforming a leading 3D volumetric model. Furthermore, the utilization of HF-GAN for data imputation substantially improves the performance of the downstream brain tumor segmentation task, demonstrating its clinical relevance.

Title: Accelerating MRI with Longitudinally-informed Latent Posterior Sampling
Authors: Yonatan Urman, Zachary Shah, Ashwin Kumar, Bruno P.Soares, Kawin Setsompop
Abstract: Purpose: To accelerate MRI acquisition by incorporating the previous scans of a subject during reconstruction. Although longitudinal imaging constitutes much of clinical MRI, leveraging previous scans is challenging due to the complex relationship between scan sessions, potentially involving substantial anatomical or pathological changes, and the lack of open-access datasets with both longitudinal pairs and raw k-space needed for training deep learning-based reconstruction models. Methods: We propose a diffusion-model-based reconstruction framework that eliminates the need for longitudinally paired training data. During training, we treat all scan timepoints as samples from the same distribution, therefore requiring only standalone images. At inference, our framework integrates a subject's prior scan in magnitude DICOM format, which is readily available in clinical workflows, to guide reconstruction of the follow-up. To support future development, we introduce an open-access clinical dataset containing multi-session pairs including prior DICOMs and follow-up k-space. Results: Our method consistently outperforms both longitudinal and non-longitudinal baseline reconstruction methods across various accelerated Cartesian acquisition strategies. In imaging regions highly similar to the prior scan, we observe up to 10\% higher SSIM and 2 dB higher PSNR, without degradation in dissimilar areas. Compared to longitudinal reconstruction baselines, our method demonstrates robustness to varying degrees of anatomical change and misregistration. Conclusion: We demonstrate that prior scans can be effectively integrated with state-of-the-art diffusion-based reconstruction methods to improve image quality and enable greater scan acceleration, without requiring an extensive longitudinally-paired training dataset.

Title: Beyond Uncertainty Quantification: Learning Uncertainty for Trust-Informed Neural Network Decisions - A Case Study in COVID-19 Classification
Authors: Hassan Gharoun, Mohammad Sadegh Khorshidi, Fang Chen, Amir H. Gandomi
Abstract: Reliable uncertainty quantification is critical in high-stakes applications, such as medical diagnosis, where confidently incorrect predictions can erode trust in automated decision-making systems. Traditional uncertainty quantification methods rely on a predefined confidence threshold to classify predictions as confident or uncertain. However, this approach assumes that predictions exceeding the threshold are trustworthy, while those below it are uncertain, without explicitly assessing the correctness of high-confidence predictions. As a result, confidently incorrect predictions may still occur, leading to misleading uncertainty assessments. To address this limitation, this study proposed an uncertainty-aware stacked neural network, which extends conventional uncertainty quantification by learning when predictions should be trusted. The framework consists of a two-tier model: the base model generates predictions with uncertainty estimates, while the meta-model learns to assign a trust flag, distinguishing confidently correct cases from those requiring expert review. The proposed approach is evaluated against the traditional threshold-based method across multiple confidence thresholds and pre-trained architectures using the COVIDx CXR-4 dataset. Results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly reduces confidently incorrect predictions, offering a more trustworthy and efficient decision-support system for high-stakes domains.

Title: Using Randomized Nyström Preconditioners to Accelerate Variational Image Reconstruction
Authors: Tao Hong, Zhaoyi Xu, Jason Hu, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: Model-based iterative reconstruction plays a key role in solving inverse problems. However, the associated minimization problems are generally large-scale, nonsmooth, and sometimes even nonconvex, which present challenges in designing efficient iterative solvers. Preconditioning methods can significantly accelerate the convergence of iterative methods. In some applications, computing preconditioners on-the-fly is beneficial. Moreover, forward models in image reconstruction are typically represented as operators, and the corresponding explicit matrices are often unavailable, which brings additional challenges in designing preconditioners. Therefore, for practical use, computing and applying preconditioners should be computationally inexpensive. This paper adapts the randomized Nyström approximation to compute effective preconditioners that accelerate image reconstruction without requiring an explicit matrix for the forward model. We leverage modern GPU computational platforms to compute the preconditioner on-the-fly. Moreover, we propose efficient approaches for applying the preconditioners to problems with classical nonsmooth regularizers, i.e., wavelet, total variation, and Hessian Schatten-norm. Our numerical results on image deblurring, super-resolution with impulsive noise, and 2D computed tomography reconstruction illustrate the efficiency and effectiveness of the proposed preconditioner.

Title: Radiance Field Delta Video Compression in Edge-Enabled Vehicular Metaverse
Authors: Matúš Dopiriak, Eugen Šlapak, Juraj Gazda, Devendra Singh Gurjar, Mohammad Abdullah Al Faruque, Marco Levorato
Abstract: Connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs) offload computationally intensive tasks to multi-access edge computing (MEC) servers via vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communication, enabling applications within the vehicular metaverse, which transforms physical environment into the digital space enabling advanced analysis or predictive modeling. A core challenge is physical-to-virtual (P2V) synchronization through digital twins (DTs), reliant on MEC networks and ultra-reliable low-latency communication (URLLC). To address this, we introduce radiance field (RF) delta video compression (RFDVC), which uses RF-encoder and RF-decoder architecture using distributed RFs as DTs storing photorealistic 3D urban scenes in compressed form. This method extracts differences between CAV-frame capturing actual traffic and RF-frame capturing empty scene from the same camera pose in batches encoded and transmitted over the MEC network. Experiments show data savings up to 71% against H.264 codec and 44% against H.265 codec under different conditions as lighting changes, and rain. RFDVC also demonstrates resilience to transmission errors, significantly outperforming the standard codec in non-rainy conditions with up to a +0.26 structural similarity index measure (SSIM) improvement over H.264 codec, and maintaining a +0.18 SSIM improvement even in challenging rainy conditions, both measured at a block error rate (BLER) of 0.25.

Title: A Volumetric Privacy Measure for Dynamical Systems With Bounded Disturbance
Authors: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei
Abstract: This paper presents a volumetric privacy framework for dynamical systems subject to bounded disturbances, developed without requiring prior knowledge of their probability distributions. We consider systems with both public and private states, where a set containing the public state is shared as the observation. An adversary is assumed to execute an inference attack by exploiting the observed public state set to estimate an uncertainty set for the private state. The volume of this inferred set quantifies the adversary's estimation uncertainty and serves as the proposed volumetric privacy metric. Approximate set-membership estimation techniques are developed to compute the private-state uncertainty set, and the properties of the privacy measure are analyzed, demonstrating that it is bounded by the information gain from the observation set. Furthermore, an optimization-based privacy filter design problem is formulated, employing randomization and linear programming to enhance the volumetric privacy level. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated through a production-inventory case study. Results show that the optimal privacy filter significantly improves robustness against inference attacks and outperforms two baseline mechanisms based on additive noise and quantization.

Title: Informativity Conditions for Multiple Signals: Properties, Experimental Design, and Applications
Authors: Ao Cao, Fuyong Wang
Abstract: Recent studies highlight the importance of persistently exciting condition in single signal sequence for model identification and data-driven control methodologies. However, maintaining prolonged excitation in control signals introduces significant challenges, as continuous excitation can reduce the lifetime of mechanical devices. In this paper, we introduce three informativity conditions for various types of multi-signal data, each augmented by weight factors. We explore the interrelations between these conditions and their rank properties in linear time-invariant systems. Furthermore, we introduce open-loop experimental design methods tailored to each of the three conditions, which can synthesize the required excitation conditions either offline or online, even in the presence of limited information within each signal segment. We demonstrate the effectiveness of these informativity conditions in least-squares identification. Additionally, all three conditions can extend Willems' fundamental lemma and are utilized to assess the properties of the system. Illustrative examples confirm that these conditions yield satisfactory outcomes in both least-squares identification and the construction of data-driven controllers.

Title: Passivity-Based Robust Shape Control of a Cable-Driven Solar Sail Boom for the CABLESSail Concept
Authors: Soojeong Lee, Ryan J. Caverly
Abstract: Solar sails provide a means of propulsion using solar radiation pressure, which offers the possibility of exciting new spacecraft capabilities. However, solar sails have attitude control challenges because of the significant disturbance torques that they encounter due to imperfections in the sail and its supporting structure, as well as limited actuation capabilities. The Cable-Actuated Bio-inspired Lightweight Elastic Solar Sail (CABLESSail) concept was previously proposed to overcome these challenges by controlling the shape of the sail through cable actuation. The structural flexibility of CABLESSail introduces control challenges, which necessitate the design of a robust feedback controller for this system. The purpose of the proposed research here is to design a robust controller to ensure precise and reliable control of CABLESSail's boom. Taking into account the system dynamics and the dynamic properties of the CABLESSail concept, a passivity-based proportional-derivative (PD) controller for a single boom on the CABLESSail system is designed. To reach the nonzero desired setpoints, a feedforward input is additionally applied to the control law and a time-varying feedforward input is used instead of the constant one to effectively track a time-varying desired boom tip deflection. This control law is assessed by numerical simulations and by tests using a smaller-scale prototype of Solar Cruiser. Both the simulation and the test results show that this PD control with the time-varying feedforward input robustly controls the flexible cable-actuated solar sail.

Title: A Synthetic Data-Driven Radiology Foundation Model for Pan-tumor Clinical Diagnosis

Abstract: AI-assisted imaging made substantial advances in tumor diagnosis and management. However, a major barrier to developing robust oncology foundation models is the scarcity of large-scale, high-quality annotated datasets, which are limited by privacy restrictions and the high cost of manual labeling. To address this gap, we present PASTA, a pan-tumor radiology foundation model built on PASTA-Gen, a synthetic data framework that generated 30,000 3D CT scans with pixel-level lesion masks and structured reports of tumors across ten organ systems. Leveraging this resource, PASTA achieves state-of-the-art performance on 45 of 46 oncology tasks, including non-contrast CT tumor screening, lesion segmentation, structured reporting, tumor staging, survival prediction, and MRI-modality transfer. To assess clinical applicability, we developed PASTA-AID, a clinical decision support system, and ran a retrospective simulated clinical trial across two scenarios. For pan-tumor screening on plain CT with fixed reading time, PASTA-AID increased radiologists' throughput by 11.1-25.1% and improved sensitivity by 17.0-31.4% and precision by 10.5-24.9%; additionally, in a diagnosis-aid workflow, it reduced segmentation time by up to 78.2% and reporting time by up to 36.5%. Beyond gains in accuracy and efficiency, PASTA-AID narrowed the expertise gap, enabling less-experienced radiologists to approach expert-level performance. Together, this work establishes an end-to-end, synthetic data-driven pipeline spanning data generation, model development, and clinical validation, thereby demonstrating substantial potential for pan-tumor research and clinical translation.

Title: FetalCLIP: A Visual-Language Foundation Model for Fetal Ultrasound Image Analysis
Authors: Fadillah Maani, Numan Saeed, Tausifa Saleem, Zaid Farooq, Hussain Alasmawi, Werner Diehl, Ameera Mohammad, Gareth Waring, Saudabi Valappi, Leanne Bricker, Mohammad Yaqub
Abstract: Foundation models are becoming increasingly effective in the medical domain, offering pre-trained models on large datasets that can be readily adapted for downstream tasks. Despite progress, fetal ultrasound images remain a challenging domain for foundation models due to their inherent complexity, often requiring substantial additional training and facing limitations due to the scarcity of paired multimodal data. To overcome these challenges, here we introduce FetalCLIP, a vision-language foundation model capable of generating universal representation of fetal ultrasound images. FetalCLIP was pre-trained using a multimodal learning approach on a diverse dataset of 210,035 fetal ultrasound images paired with text. This represents the largest paired dataset of its kind used for foundation model development to date. This unique training approach allows FetalCLIP to effectively learn the intricate anatomical features present in fetal ultrasound images, resulting in robust representations that can be used for a variety of downstream applications. In extensive benchmarking across a range of key fetal ultrasound applications, including classification, gestational age estimation, congenital heart defect (CHD) detection, and fetal structure segmentation, FetalCLIP outperformed all baselines while demonstrating remarkable generalizability and strong performance even with limited labeled data. We plan to release the FetalCLIP model publicly for the benefit of the broader scientific community.

Title: Geodesic Diffusion Models for Efficient Medical Image Enhancement
Authors: Teng Zhang, Hongxu Jiang, Kuang Gong, Wei Shao
Abstract: Diffusion models generate data by learning to reverse a forward process, where samples are progressively perturbed with Gaussian noise according to a predefined noise schedule. From a geometric perspective, each noise schedule corresponds to a unique trajectory in probability space from the data distribution to a Gaussian prior. However, prior diffusion models rely on empirically chosen schedules that may not be optimal. This inefficiency necessitates many intermediate time steps, resulting in high computational costs during both training and sampling. To address this, we derive a family of geodesic noise schedules corresponding to the shortest paths in probability space under the Fisher-Rao metric. Based on these schedules, we propose Geodesic Diffusion Models (GDMs), which significantly improve training and sampling efficiency by minimizing the energy required to transform between probability distributions. This efficiency further enables sampling to start from an intermediate distribution in conditional image generation, achieving state-of-the-art results with as few as 6 steps. We evaluated GDM on two medical image enhancement tasks: CT image denoising and MRI image super-resolution. Experimental results show that GDM achieved state-of-the-art performance while reducing training time by 20- to 30-fold compared to Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and 4- to 6-fold compared to Fast-DDPM, and accelerating sampling by 160- to 170-fold and 1.6-fold, respectively. These gains support the use of GDM for efficient model development and real-time clinical applications. Our code is publicly available at: this https URL.

Title: Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics Enhanced by Ensemble Learning, Multi-Step Prediction Evaluation, Elite Strategy, and Classification Techniques for Applications to Industrial Systems
Authors: Shuichi Yahagi, Ansei Yonezawa, Hiroki Seto, Heisei Yonezawa, Itsuro Kajiwara
Abstract: This paper proposes a sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy) with control and exogenous inputs for highly accurate and reliable prediction. Although SINDy is recognized as a remarkable approach for identifying nonlinear systems, several challenges remain. Its application to industrial systems remains limited, and multi-step predictions are not guaranteed due to overfitting and noisy data. This phenomenon is often caused by the increase in basis functions resulting from the extension of coordinates, such as time-delay embedding. To address these problems, this study proposes an emphasized SINDy framework by integrating ensemble-learning, multi-step prediction evaluations, elite strategy, and classification techniques (EMEC-SINDy), while preserving convex optimization. The proposed method employs library bagging and extracts elites with an R-squared greater than 90%. Then, clustering is performed on the surviving elites because physically motivated basis functions are not always available, and the elites obtained do not always have similar basis functions. After the classification, discrete model candidates are obtained by taking the mean of each classified elite. Finally, the best model is selected. Simulation results demonstrate that EMEC-SINDy significantly outperforms original SINDy approaches in multi-step prediction accuracy under noisy conditions, validating its applicability to the diesel engine airpath system, which is known as a complex and highly coupled nonlinear multi-input multi-output system.

Title: An ANN-Enhanced Approach for Flatness-Based Constrained Control of Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Huu-Thinh Do, Ionela Prodan, Florin Stoican
Abstract: Neural networks have proven practical for a synergistic combination of advanced control techniques. This work analyzes the implementation of rectified linear unit neural networks to achieve constrained control in differentially flat systems. Specifically, the class of flat systems enjoys the benefit of feedback linearizability, i.e., the systems can be linearized by means of a proper variable transformation. However, the price for linearizing the dynamics is that the constraint descriptions are distorted geometrically. Our results show that, by using neural networks, these constraints can be represented as a union of polytopes, enabling the use of mixed-integer programming tools to guarantee constraint satisfaction. We further analyze the integration of the characterization into efficient settings such as control Lyapunov function-based and model predictive control (MPC). Interestingly, this description also allows us to explicitly compute the solution of the MPC problem for the nonlinear system. Several examples are provided to illustrate the effectiveness of our framework.

Title: Dimension Scaling SR-Net for Super-Resolution Radar Range Profiles
Authors: Ziwen Wang, Jianping Wang, Pucheng Li, Zegang Ding
Abstract: High-resolution radar range profile (RRP) is crucial for accurate target recognition and scene perception. To get a high-resolution RRP, many methods have been developed, such as multiple signal classification (MUSIC), orthogonal matching pursuit (OMP), and a few deep learning-based approaches. Although they break through the Rayleigh resolution limit determined by radar signal bandwidth, these methods either get limited super-resolution capability or work well just in high signal to noise ratio (SNR) scenarios. To overcome these limitations, in this paper, an interpretable unfolded neural network for super-resolution RRP (DSSR-Net) is proposed by integrating the advantages of both model-guided and data-driven models. Specifically, DSSR-Net is designed based on a sparse representation model with dimension scaling, and then trained on a training dataset. Through dimension scaling, DSSR-Net lifts the radar signal into high-dimensional space to extract subtle features of closely spaced objects and suppress the noise of the high-dimensional features. It improves the super-resolving power of closely spaced objects and lowers the SNR requirement of radar signals compared to existing methods. The superiority of the proposed algorithm for super-resolution RRP reconstruction is verified via experiments with both synthetic and measured data.

Title: Nash equilibrium seeking in coalition games for multiple Euler-Lagrange systems: Analysis and application to USV swarm confrontation
Authors: Cheng Yuwen, Jialing Zhou, Meng Luan, Guanghui Wen, Tingwen Huang
Abstract: This paper addresses a class of Nash equilibrium (NE) seeking problems in coalition games involving both local and coupling constraints for multiple Euler-Lagrange (EL) systems subject to disturbances of unknown bounds. Within each coalition, agents cooperatively minimize a shared cost function while competing against other coalitions. A distributed strategy is proposed to seek the NE under informational constraints, where each agent has access only to its own action, cost function, and constraint parameters. In the proposed distributed NE seeking strategy, adaptive techniques are combined with sign functions to handle model uncertainties and disturbances with unknown bounds in the EL systems. To deal with the Lagrange multipliers associated with local and coupling constraints, primal-dual techniques are integrated with consensus protocols. Additionally, a dynamic average consensus algorithm is employed to estimate the gradient of the coalition cost function, while a leader-following protocol is utilized to estimate the actions of other agents. Under standard convexity and graph-connectivity assumptions, global convergence of the closed-loop EL system to the NE is established. As an illustrative application, a swarm confrontation of unmanned surface vehicles involving formation, encirclement, and interception tasks is modeled within the coalition game framework, and numerical simulations are conducted under this model to validate the theoretical results.

Title: Convergent Complex Quasi-Newton Proximal Methods for Gradient-Driven Denoisers in Compressed Sensing MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Tao Hong, Zhaoyi Xu, Se Young Chun, Luis Hernandez-Garcia, Jeffrey A. Fessler
Abstract: In compressed sensing (CS) MRI, model-based methods are pivotal to achieving accurate reconstruction. One of the main challenges in model-based methods is finding an effective prior to describe the statistical distribution of the target image. Plug-and-Play (PnP) and REgularization by Denoising (RED) are two general frameworks that use denoisers as the prior. While PnP/RED methods with convolutional neural networks (CNNs) based denoisers outperform classical hand-crafted priors in CS MRI, their convergence theory relies on assumptions that do not hold for practical CNNs. The recently developed gradient-driven denoisers offer a framework that bridges the gap between practical performance and theoretical guarantees. However, the numerical solvers for the associated minimization problem remain slow for CS MRI reconstruction. This paper proposes a complex quasi-Newton proximal method that achieves faster convergence than existing approaches. To address the complex domain in CS MRI, we propose a modified Hessian estimation method that guarantees Hermitian positive definiteness. Furthermore, we provide a rigorous convergence analysis of the proposed method for nonconvex settings. Numerical experiments on both Cartesian and non-Cartesian sampling trajectories demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of our approach.

Title: BINAQUAL: A Full-Reference Objective Localization Similarity Metric for Binaural Audio
Authors: Davoud Shariat Panah, Dan Barry, Alessandro Ragano, Jan Skoglund, Andrew Hines
Abstract: Spatial audio enhances immersion in applications such as virtual reality, augmented reality, gaming, and cinema by creating a three-dimensional auditory experience. Ensuring the spatial fidelity of binaural audio is crucial, given that processes such as compression, encoding, or transmission can alter localization cues. While subjective listening tests like MUSHRA remain the gold standard for evaluating spatial localization quality, they are costly and time-consuming. This paper introduces BINAQUAL, a full-reference objective metric designed to assess localization similarity in binaural audio recordings. BINAQUAL adapts the AMBIQUAL metric, originally developed for localization quality assessment in ambisonics audio format to the binaural domain. We evaluate BINAQUAL across five key research questions, examining its sensitivity to variations in sound source locations, angle interpolations, surround speaker layouts, audio degradations, and content diversity. Results demonstrate that BINAQUAL effectively differentiates between subtle spatial variations and correlates strongly with subjective listening tests, making it a reliable metric for binaural localization quality assessment. The proposed metric provides a robust benchmark for ensuring spatial accuracy in binaural audio processing, paving the way for improved objective evaluations in immersive audio applications.

Title: CrossRF: A Domain-Invariant Deep Learning Approach for RF Fingerprinting
Authors: Fahrettin Emin Tiras, Hayriye Serra Altinoluk
Abstract: Radio Frequency (RF) fingerprinting offers a promising approach for drone identification and security, although it suffers from significant performance degradation when operating on different transmission channels. This paper presents CrossRF, a domain-invariant deep learning approach that addresses the problem of cross-channel RF fingerprinting for Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) identification. Our approach aims to minimize the domain gap between different RF channels by using adversarial learning to train a more robust model that maintains consistent identification performance despite channel variations. We validate our approach using the UAVSig dataset, comprising real-world over-the-air RF signals from identical drone models operating across several frequency channels, ensuring that the findings correspond to real-world scenarios. The experimental results show CrossRF's efficiency, achieving up to 99.03% accuracy when adapting from Channel 3 to Channel 4, compared to only 26.39% using conventional methods. The model maintains robust performance in more difficult multi-channel scenarios (87.57% accuracy adapting from Channels 1,3 to 2,4) and achieves 89.45% accuracy with 0.9 precision for controller classification. These results confirm CrossRF's ability to significantly reduce performance degradation due to cross-channel variations while maintaining high identification accuracy with minimal training data requirements, making it particularly suitable for practical drone security applications.

Title: Self-Supervised-ISAR-Net Enables Fast Sparse ISAR Imaging
Authors: Ziwen Wang, Jianping wang, Pucheng Li, Yifan Wu, Zegang Ding
Abstract: Numerous sparse inverse synthetic aperture radar (ISAR) imaging methods based on unfolded neural networks have been developed for high-quality image reconstruction with sparse measurements. However, their training typically requires paired ISAR images and echoes, which are often difficult to obtain. Meanwhile, one property can be observed that for a certain sparse measurement configuration of ISAR, when a target is rotated around its center of mass, only the image of the target undergoes the corresponding rotation after ISAR imaging, while the grating lobes do not follow this rotation and are solely determined by the sparse-sampling pattern. This property is mathematically termed as the equivariant property. Taking advantage of this property, an unfolded neural network for sparse ISAR imaging with self-supervised learning, named SS-ISAR-Net is proposed. It effectively mitigates grating lobes caused by sparse radar echo, allowing high-quality training to be achieved using only sparse radar echo data. The superiority of the proposed SS-ISAR-Net, compared to existing methods, is verified through experiments with both synthetic and real-world measurement data.

Title: SongBloom: Coherent Song Generation via Interleaved Autoregressive Sketching and Diffusion Refinement
Authors: Chenyu Yang, Shuai Wang, Hangting Chen, Wei Tan, Jianwei Yu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Generating music with coherent structure, harmonious instrumental and vocal elements remains a significant challenge in song generation. Existing language models and diffusion-based methods often struggle to balance global coherence with local fidelity, resulting in outputs that lack musicality or suffer from incoherent progression and mismatched lyrics. This paper introduces $\textbf{SongBloom}$, a novel framework for full-length song generation that leverages an interleaved paradigm of autoregressive sketching and diffusion-based refinement. SongBloom employs an autoregressive diffusion model that combines the high fidelity of diffusion models with the scalability of language models. Specifically, it gradually extends a musical sketch from short to long and refines the details from coarse to fine-grained. The interleaved generation paradigm effectively integrates prior semantic and acoustic context to guide the generation process. Experimental results demonstrate that SongBloom outperforms existing methods across both subjective and objective metrics and achieves performance comparable to the state-of-the-art commercial music generation platforms. Audio samples are available on our demo page: this https URL. The code and model weights have been released on this https URL .

Title: Post-training for Deepfake Speech Detection
Authors: Wanying Ge, Xin Wang, Xuechen Liu, Junichi Yamagishi
Abstract: We introduce a post-training approach that adapts self-supervised learning (SSL) models for deepfake speech detection by bridging the gap between general pre-training and domain-specific fine-tuning. We present AntiDeepfake models, a series of post-trained models developed using a large-scale multilingual speech dataset containing over 56,000 hours of genuine speech and 18,000 hours of speech with various artifacts in over one hundred languages. Experimental results show that the post-trained models already exhibit strong robustness and generalization to unseen deepfake speech. When they are further fine-tuned on the Deepfake-Eval-2024 dataset, these models consistently surpass existing state-of-the-art detectors that do not leverage post-training. Model checkpoints and source code are available online.

Title: Distance-Domain Degrees of Freedom in Near-Field Region
Authors: Son T. Duong, Tho Le-Ngoc
Abstract: Extremely large aperture arrays operating in the near-field regime unlock additional spatial resources, which can be exploited to simultaneously serve multiple users even when they share the same angular direction. This work investigates the distance-domain degrees of freedom (DoF), defined as the DoF when a user varies only its distance to the base station and not the angle. To obtain the distance-domain DoF, we study a line-of-sight (LoS) channel with a source representing a base station and an observation region representing users, where the source is a large two-dimensional transmit (Tx) array with arbitrary shape and the observation region is an arbitrarily long linear receive (Rx) array with collinearly aligned elements located at different distances from the Tx array. We assume that both the Tx and Rx arrays have continuous apertures with an infinite number of elements and infinitesimal spacing, which establishes an upper bound for the distance-domain DoF in the case of a finite number of elements. First, we analyze an ideal case where the Tx array is a single piece and the Rx array is on the broadside of the Tx array. By reformulating the channel as an integral operator with a Hermitian convolution kernel, we derive a closed-form expression for the distance-domain DoF via the Fourier transform. Our analysis shows that the distance-domain DoF is predominantly determined by the extreme boundaries of both the Tx and Rx arrays rather than their detailed interior structure. We further extend the framework to non-broadside configurations by employing a projection method that converts the problem to an equivalent broadside case. Finally, we extend the analytical framework to modular arrays and show the distance-domain DoF gain over a single-piece array under a fixed total physical length.

Title: SV-DRR: High-Fidelity Novel View X-Ray Synthesis Using Diffusion Model
Authors: Chun Xie, Yuichi Yoshii, Itaru Kitahara
Abstract: X-ray imaging is a rapid and cost-effective tool for visualizing internal human anatomy. While multi-view X-ray imaging provides complementary information that enhances diagnosis, intervention, and education, acquiring images from multiple angles increases radiation exposure and complicates clinical workflows. To address these challenges, we propose a novel view-conditioned diffusion model for synthesizing multi-view X-ray images from a single view. Unlike prior methods, which are limited in angular range, resolution, and image quality, our approach leverages the Diffusion Transformer to preserve fine details and employs a weak-to-strong training strategy for stable high-resolution image generation. Experimental results demonstrate that our method generates higher-resolution outputs with improved control over viewing angles. This capability has significant implications not only for clinical applications but also for medical education and data extension, enabling the creation of diverse, high-quality datasets for training and analysis.

Title: Multimodal Fusion at Three Tiers: Physics-Driven Data Generation and Vision-Language Guidance for Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Mingda Zhang
Abstract: Accurate brain tumor segmentation is crucial for neuro-oncology diagnosis and treatment planning. Deep learning methods have made significant progress, but automatic segmentation still faces challenges, including tumor morphological heterogeneity and complex three-dimensional spatial relationships. This paper proposes a three-tier fusion architecture that achieves precise brain tumor segmentation. The method processes information progressively at the pixel, feature, and semantic levels. At the pixel level, physical modeling extends magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) to multimodal data, including simulated ultrasound and synthetic computed tomography (CT). At the feature level, the method performs Transformer-based cross-modal feature fusion through multi-teacher collaborative distillation, integrating three expert teachers (MRI, US, CT). At the semantic level, clinical textual knowledge generated by GPT-4V is transformed into spatial guidance signals using CLIP contrastive learning and Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM). These three tiers together form a complete processing chain from data augmentation to feature extraction to semantic guidance. We validated the method on the Brain Tumor Segmentation (BraTS) 2020, 2021, and 2023 datasets. The model achieves average Dice coefficients of 0.8665, 0.9014, and 0.8912 on the three datasets, respectively, and reduces the 95% Hausdorff Distance (HD95) by an average of 6.57 millimeters compared with the baseline. This method provides a new paradigm for precise tumor segmentation and boundary localization.

Title: SpectraLift: Physics-Guided Spectral-Inversion Network for Self-Supervised Hyperspectral Image Super-Resolution
Authors: Ritik Shah, Marco F. Duarte
Abstract: High-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (HSI) are essential for applications such as remote sensing and medical imaging, yet HSI sensors inherently trade spatial detail for spectral richness. Fusing high-spatial-resolution multispectral images (HR-MSI) with low-spatial-resolution hyperspectral images (LR-HSI) is a promising route to recover fine spatial structures without sacrificing spectral fidelity. Most state-of-the-art methods for HSI-MSI fusion demand point spread function (PSF) calibration or ground truth high resolution HSI (HR-HSI), both of which are impractical to obtain in real world settings. We present SpectraLift, a fully self-supervised framework that fuses LR-HSI and HR-MSI inputs using only the MSI's Spectral Response Function (SRF). SpectraLift trains a lightweight per-pixel multi-layer perceptron (MLP) network using ($i$)~a synthetic low-spatial-resolution multispectral image (LR-MSI) obtained by applying the SRF to the LR-HSI as input, ($ii$)~the LR-HSI as the output, and ($iii$)~an $\ell_1$ spectral reconstruction loss between the estimated and true LR-HSI as the optimization objective. At inference, SpectraLift uses the trained network to map the HR-MSI pixel-wise into a HR-HSI estimate. SpectraLift converges in minutes, is agnostic to spatial blur and resolution, and outperforms state-of-the-art methods on PSNR, SAM, SSIM, and RMSE benchmarks.

Title: A Multi-Stage Hybrid CNN-Transformer Network for Automated Pediatric Lung Sound Classification
Authors: Samiul Based Shuvo, Taufiq Hasan
Abstract: Automated analysis of lung sound auscultation is essential for monitoring respiratory health, especially in regions facing a shortage of skilled healthcare workers. While respiratory sound classification has been widely studied in adults, its ap plication in pediatric populations, particularly in children aged <6 years, remains an underexplored area. The developmental changes in pediatric lungs considerably alter the acoustic proper ties of respiratory sounds, necessitating specialized classification approaches tailored to this age group. To address this, we propose a multistage hybrid CNN-Transformer framework that combines CNN-extracted features with an attention-based architecture to classify pediatric respiratory diseases using scalogram images from both full recordings and individual breath events. Our model achieved an overall score of 0.9039 in binary event classifi cation and 0.8448 in multiclass event classification by employing class-wise focal loss to address data imbalance. At the recording level, the model attained scores of 0.720 for ternary and 0.571 for multiclass classification. These scores outperform the previous best models by 3.81% and 5.94%, respectively. This approach offers a promising solution for scalable pediatric respiratory disease diagnosis, especially in resource-limited settings.

Title: The impact of large-scale EV charging on the real-time operation of distribution systems: A comprehensive review
Authors: Zhe Yu, Chuang Yang, Qin Wang
Abstract: With the large-scale integration of electric vehicles (EVs) in the distribution grid, the unpredictable nature of EV charging introduces considerable uncertainties to the grid's real-time operations. This can exacerbate load fluctuations, compromise power quality, and pose risks to the grid's stability and security. However, due to their dual role as controllable loads and energy storage devices, EVs have the potential to mitigate these fluctuations, balance the variability of renewable energy sources, and provide ancillary services that support grid stability. By leveraging the bidirectional flow of information and energy in smart grids, the adverse effects of EV charging can be minimized and even converted into beneficial outcomes through effective real-time management strategies. This paper explores the negative impacts of EV charging on the distribution system's real-time operations and outlines methods to transform these challenges into positive contributions. Additionally, it provides an in-depth analysis of the real-time management system for EV charging, focusing on state estimation and management strategies.

Title: Test-Time Training for Speech Enhancement
Authors: Avishkar Behera, Riya Ann Easow, Venkatesh Parvathala, K. Sri Rama Murty
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel application of Test-Time Training (TTT) for Speech Enhancement, addressing the challenges posed by unpredictable noise conditions and domain shifts. This method combines a main speech enhancement task with a self-supervised auxiliary task in a Y-shaped architecture. The model dynamically adapts to new domains during inference time by optimizing the proposed self-supervised tasks like noise-augmented signal reconstruction or masked spectrogram prediction, bypassing the need for labeled data. We further introduce various TTT strategies offering a trade-off between adaptation and efficiency. Evaluations across synthetic and real-world datasets show consistent improvements across speech quality metrics, outperforming the baseline model. This work highlights the effectiveness of TTT in speech enhancement, providing insights for future research in adaptive and robust speech processing.

Title: REACT-KD: Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation for Interpretable Medical Image Classification
Authors: Hongzhao Chen, Hexiao Ding, Yufeng Jiang, Jing Lan, Ka Chun Li, Gerald W.Y. Cheng, Nga-Chun Ng, Yao Pu, Jing Cai, Liang-ting Lin, Jung Sun Yoo
Abstract: Reliable and interpretable tumor classification from clinical imaging remains a core challenge. The main difficulties arise from heterogeneous modality quality, limited annotations, and the absence of structured anatomical guidance. We present REACT-KD, a Region-Aware Cross-modal Topological Knowledge Distillation framework that transfers supervision from high-fidelity multi-modal sources into a lightweight CT-based student model. The framework employs a dual teacher design. One branch captures structure-function relationships through dual-tracer PET/CT, while the other models dose-aware features using synthetically degraded low-dose CT. These branches jointly guide the student model through two complementary objectives. The first achieves semantic alignment through logits distillation, and the second models anatomical topology through region graph distillation. A shared CBAM3D module ensures consistent attention across modalities. To improve reliability in deployment, REACT-KD introduces modality dropout during training, which enables robust inference under partial or noisy inputs. As a case study, we applied REACT-KD to hepatocellular carcinoma staging. The framework achieved an average AUC of 93.5\% on an internal PET/CT cohort and maintained 76.6\% to 81.5\% AUC across varying levels of dose degradation in external CT testing. Decision curve analysis further shows that REACT-KD consistently provides the highest net clinical benefit across all thresholds, confirming its value in real-world diagnostic practice.

Title: Direct data-driven interpolation and approximation of linear parameter-varying system trajectories
Authors: Chris Verhoek, Ivan Markovsky, Roland Tóth
Abstract: We consider the problem of estimating missing values in trajectories of linear parameter-varying (LPV) systems. We solve this interpolation problem for the class of shifted-affine LPV systems. Conditions for the existence and uniqueness of solutions are given and a direct data-driven algorithm for its computation is presented, i.e., the data-generating system is not given by a parametric model but is implicitly specified by data. We illustrate the applicability of the proposed solution on illustrative examples of a mass-spring-damper system with exogenous and endogenous parameter variation.

Title: Performance Analysis of Underwater Optical Wireless Communication Using O-RIS and Fiber Optic Backhaul (Extended version)
Authors: Aboozar Heydaribeni, Hamzeh Beyranvand
Abstract: This Letter presents a novel hybrid underwater wireless optical communication (UWOC) system that integrates underwater optical access points (UOAPs) with a passive optical network (PON)-based fiber-optic backhaul to provide a resilient backbone. A hard switching mechanism is employed between direct and optical reconfigurable intelligent surface (O-RIS)-assisted links to ensure reliable connectivity. Unlike previous studies, the proposed system is evaluated under both active and multiple passive O-RIS configurations. To enhance reliability, the Selection Combining (SC) and Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) schemes are applied. Analytical and simulation results demonstrate that optimal O-RIS placement significantly enhances system performance. However, in the linear regime, placing it too close to the receiver causes degradation due to increased path loss and beam jitter in an identical water type. Moreover, increasing the number of O-RIS elements within practical limits further improves overall system performance and enhances adaptability to variations in the underwater channel.

Title: Robust Pan-Cancer Mitotic Figure Detection with YOLOv12
Authors: Raphaël Bourgade, Guillaume Balezo, Hana Feki, Lily Monier, Matthieu Blons, Alice Blondel, Delphine Loussouarn, Anne Vincent-Salomon, Thomas Walter
Abstract: Mitotic figures represent a key histoprognostic feature in tumor pathology, providing crucial insights into tumor aggressiveness and proliferation. However, their identification remains challenging, subject to significant inter-observer variability, even among experienced pathologists. To address this issue, the MItosis DOmain Generalization (MIDOG) 2025 challenge marks the third edition of an international competition aiming to develop robust mitosis detection algorithms. In this paper, we present a mitotic figure detection approach based on the state-of-the-art YOLOv12 object detection architecture. Our method achieved an F1-score of 0.801 on the preliminary test set (hotspots only) and ranked second on the final test leaderboard with an F1-score of 0.7216 across complex and heterogeneous whole-slide regions, without relying on external data.

Title: Model-Free Dynamic Consensus in Multi-Agent Systems: A Q-Function Perspective
Authors: Maryam Babazadeh, Naim Bajcinca
Abstract: This paper presents a new method for achieving dynamic consensus in linear discrete-time homogeneous multi-agent systems (MAS) with marginally stable or unstable dynamics. The guarantee of consensus in this setting involves a set of constraints based on the graph's spectral properties, complicating the design of the coupling gains. This challenge intensifies for large-scale systems with diverse graph Laplacian spectra. The proposed approach reformulates the dynamic consensus problem with a prescribed convergence rate using a state-action value function framework inspired by optimal control theory. Specifically, a synthetic linear quadratic regulation (LQR) formulation is introduced to encode the consensus objective, enabling its translation into a convex semidefinite programming (SDP) problem. The resulting SDP is applicable in both model-based and model-free settings for jointly designing the local feedback and coupling gains. To handle the inherent non-convex feasibility conditions, a convex-concave decomposition strategy is employed. Adaptation of the method in a completely model-free set-up eliminates the need for system identification or knowledge of the agents' dynamics. Instead, it relies on input-state data collection and offers an entirely data-driven equivalent SDP formulation. Finally, a new algorithm balancing feasibility, convergence rate, robustness, and energy efficiency, is established to provide design flexibility. Numerical simulations validate the method's effectiveness in various scenarios.

Title: A Secure Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing System for Next-Generation Wireless Communications
Authors: Ping Wang, Zulin Wang, Yuanhan Ni, Qu Luo, Yuanfang Ma, Xiaosi Tian, Pei Xiao
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) has garnered significant attention due to its superior performance in high-mobility scenarios, coupled with multiple waveform parameters that provide greater degrees of freedom for system design. This paper introduces a novel secure affine frequency division multiplexing (SE-AFDM) system, which advances prior designs by dynamically varying an AFDM pre-chirp parameter to enhance physical-layer security. In the SE-AFDM system, the pre-chirp parameter is dynamically generated from a codebook controlled by a long-period pseudo-noise (LPPN) sequence. Instead of applying spreading in the data domain, our parameter-domain spreading approach provides additional security while maintaining reliability and high spectrum efficiency. We also propose a synchronization framework to solve the problem of reliably and rapidly synchronizing the time-varying parameter in fast time-varying channels. The theoretical derivations prove that unsynchronized eavesdroppers cannot eliminate the nonlinear impact of the time-varying parameter and further provide useful guidance for codebook design. Simulation results demonstrate the security advantages of the proposed SE-AFDM system in high-mobility scenarios, while our hardware prototype validates the effectiveness of the proposed synchronization framework.

Title: Guitar Tone Morphing by Diffusion-based Model
Authors: Kuan-Yu Chen, Kuan-Lin Chen, Yu-Chieh Yu, Jian-Jiun Ding
Abstract: In Music Information Retrieval (MIR), modeling and transforming the tone of musical instruments, particularly electric guitars, has gained increasing attention due to the richness of the instrument tone and the flexibility of expression. Tone morphing enables smooth transitions between different guitar sounds, giving musicians greater freedom to explore new textures and personalize their performances. This study explores learning-based approaches for guitar tone morphing, beginning with LoRA fine-tuning to improve the model performance on limited data. Moreover, we introduce a simpler method, named spherical interpolation using Music2Latent. It yields significantly better results than the more complex fine-tuning approach. Experiments show that the proposed architecture generates smoother and more natural tone transitions, making it a practical and efficient tool for music production and real-time audio effects.

Title: JND-Guided Light-Weight Neural Pre-Filter for Perceptual Image Coding
Authors: Chenlong He, Zhijian Hao, Leilei Huang, Xiaoyang Zeng, Yibo Fan
Abstract: Just Noticeable Distortion (JND)-guided pre-filter is a promising technique for improving the perceptual compression efficiency of image coding. However, existing methods are often computationally expensive, and the field lacks standardized benchmarks for fair comparison. To address these challenges, this paper introduces a twofold contribution. First, we develop and open-source FJNDF-Pytorch, a unified benchmark for frequency-domain JND-Guided pre-filters. Second, leveraging this platform, we propose a complete learning framework for a novel, lightweight Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method achieves state-of-the-art compression efficiency, consistently outperforming competitors across multiple datasets and encoders. In terms of computational cost, our model is exceptionally lightweight, requiring only 7.15 GFLOPs to process a 1080p image, which is merely 14.1% of the cost of recent lightweight network. Our work presents a robust, state-of-the-art solution that excels in both performance and efficiency, supported by a reproducible research platform. The open-source implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: Robust Closed-Form Control for MIMO Nonlinear Systems under Conflicting Time-Varying Hard and Soft Constraints (extended version)
Authors: Farhad Mehdifar, Charalampos P. Bechlioulis, Dimos V. Dimarogonas
Abstract: This paper introduces a novel robust closed-form control law to handle time-varying hard and soft constraints in uncertain high-relative-degree nonlinear MIMO systems. These constraints represent spatiotemporal specifications in mechanical systems' operational space, with hard constraints ensuring safety-critical requirements and soft constraints encoding performance or task objectives. Initially, all constraints are consolidated into two separate scalar time-varying hard and soft constraint functions, whose positive level sets define feasible regions. A closed-form control law is developed to enforce these constraints using appropriately designed reciprocal barriers and nonlinear transformation functions. When conflicts between hard and soft constraints arise, the control law prioritizes hard constraints by virtually relaxing soft constraints via a dynamic relaxation law. Notably, the proposed control law maintains low complexity by avoiding approximation schemes for coping with system uncertainties. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: A Human-Vector Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible Model for Analyzing and Controlling the Spread of Vector-Borne Diseases
Authors: Lorenzo Zino, Alessandro Casu, Alessandro Rizzo
Abstract: We propose an epidemic model for the spread of vector-borne diseases. The model, which is built extending the classical susceptible-infected-susceptible model, accounts for two populations -- humans and vectors -- and for cross-contagion between the two species, whereby humans become infected upon interaction with carrier vectors, and vectors become carriers after interaction with infected humans. We formulate the model as a system of ordinary differential equations and leverage monotone systems theory to rigorously characterize the epidemic dynamics. Specifically, we characterize the global asymptotic behavior of the disease, determining conditions for quick eradication of the disease (i.e., for which all trajectories converge to a disease-free equilibrium), or convergence to a (unique) endemic equilibrium. Then, we incorporate two control actions: namely, vector control and incentives to adopt protection measures. Using the derived mathematical tools, we assess the impact of these two control actions and determine the optimal control policy.

Title: Observer Design over Hypercomplex Quaternions
Authors: Michael Sebek
Abstract: We develop observer design over hypercomplex quaternions in a characteristic-polynomial-free framework. Using the standard right-module convention, we derive a right observable companion form and its companion polynomial that encodes error dynamics via right-eigenvalue similarity classes. The design mirrors the real/complex case - coefficient updates in companion coordinates, followed by a similarity back - yet avoids determinants, characteristic/minimal polynomials, and Cayley-Hamilton identities that do not transfer to quaternions. We also give an Ackermann-type construction for the important case of closed-loop companion polynomials with real coefficients, ensuring similarity-equivariant evaluation. The results yield simple recipes for full-order observers directly over quaternions, clarify the role of right spectra and their similarity classes, and pinpoint when classical one-shot formulas remain valid. Numerical examples illustrate the method and advantages over vectorized or complex-adjoint surrogates.

Title: Identification and Adaptive Control of Markov Jump Systems: Sample Complexity and Regret Bounds
Authors: Yahya Sattar, Zhe Du, Davoud Ataee Tarzanagh, Laura Balzano, Necmiye Ozay, Samet Oymak
Abstract: Learning how to effectively control unknown dynamical systems is crucial for intelligent autonomous systems. This task becomes a significant challenge when the underlying dynamics are changing with time. Motivated by this challenge, this paper considers the problem of controlling an unknown Markov jump linear system (MJS) to optimize a quadratic objective. By taking a model-based perspective, we consider identification-based adaptive control of MJSs. We first provide a system identification algorithm for MJS to learn the dynamics in each mode as well as the Markov transition matrix, underlying the evolution of the mode switches, from a single trajectory of the system states, inputs, and modes. Through martingale-based arguments, sample complexity of this algorithm is shown to be $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{T})$. We then propose an adaptive control scheme that performs system identification together with certainty equivalent control to adapt the controllers in an episodic fashion. Combining our sample complexity results with recent perturbation results for certainty equivalent control, we prove that when the episode lengths are appropriately chosen, the proposed adaptive control scheme achieves $\mathcal{O}(\sqrt{T})$ regret, which can be improved to $\mathcal{O}(polylog(T))$ with partial knowledge of the system. Our proof strategy introduces innovations to handle Markovian jumps and a weaker notion of stability common in MJSs. Our analysis provides insights into system theoretic quantities that affect learning accuracy and control performance. Numerical simulations are presented to further reinforce these insights.

Title: FIRE: A Failure-Adaptive Reinforcement Learning Framework for Edge Computing Migrations
Authors: Marie Siew, Shikhar Sharma, Zekai Li, Kun Guo, Chao Xu, Tania Lorido-Botran, Tony Q.S. Quek, Carlee Joe-Wong
Abstract: In edge computing, users' service profiles are migrated due to user mobility. Reinforcement learning (RL) frameworks have been proposed to do so, often trained on simulated data. However, existing RL frameworks overlook occasional server failures, which although rare, impact latency-sensitive applications like autonomous driving and real-time obstacle detection. Nevertheless, these failures (rare events), being not adequately represented in historical training data, pose a challenge for data-driven RL algorithms. As it is impractical to adjust failure frequency in real-world applications for training, we introduce FIRE, a framework that adapts to rare events by training a RL policy in an edge computing digital twin environment. We propose ImRE, an importance sampling-based Q-learning algorithm, which samples rare events proportionally to their impact on the value function. FIRE considers delay, migration, failure, and backup placement costs across individual and shared service profiles. We prove ImRE's boundedness and convergence to optimality. Next, we introduce novel deep Q-learning (ImDQL) and actor critic (ImACRE) versions of our algorithm to enhance scalability. We extend our framework to accommodate users with varying risk tolerances. Through trace driven experiments, we show that FIRE reduces costs compared to vanilla RL and the greedy baseline in the event of failures.

Title: A Tracking prior to Localization workflow for Ultrasound Localization Microscopy
Authors: Alexis Leconte, Jonathan Porée, Brice Rauby, Alice Wu, Nin Ghigo, Paul Xing, Chloé Bourquin, Gerardo Ramos-Palacios, Abbas F. Sadikot, Jean Provost
Abstract: Ultrasound Localization Microscopy (ULM) has proven effective in resolving microvascular structures and local mean velocities at sub-diffraction-limited scales, offering high-resolution imaging capabilities. Dynamic ULM (DULM) enables the creation of angiography or velocity movies throughout cardiac cycles. Currently, these techniques rely on a Localization-and-Tracking (LAT) workflow consisting in detecting microbubbles (MB) in the frames before pairing them to generate tracks. While conventional LAT methods perform well at low concentrations, they suffer from longer acquisition times and degraded localization and tracking accuracy at higher concentrations, leading to biased angiogram reconstruction and velocity estimation. In this study, we propose a novel approach to address these challenges by reversing the current workflow. The proposed method, Tracking-and-Localization (TAL), relies on first tracking the MB and then performing localization. Through comprehensive benchmarking using both in silico and in vivo experiments and employing various metrics to quantify ULM angiography and velocity maps, we demonstrate that the TAL method consistently outperforms the reference LAT workflow. Moreover, when applied to DULM, TAL successfully extracts velocity variations along the cardiac cycle with improved repeatability. The findings of this work highlight the effectiveness of the TAL approach in overcoming the limitations of conventional LAT methods, providing enhanced ULM angiography and velocity imaging.

Title: UniCrossFi: A Unified Framework For Cross-Domain Wi-Fi-based Gesture Recognition
Authors: Ke Xu, Zhiyong Zheng, Hongyuan Zhu, Lei Wang, Jiangtao Wang
Abstract: Wi-Fi sensing systems are severely hindered by cross domain problem when deployed in unseen real-world environments. Existing methods typically design separate frameworks for either domain adaptation or domain generalization, often relying on extensive labeled data. Existing methods that designed for domain generalization is often relying on extensive labeled data. However, real-world scenarios are far more complex, where the deployed model must be capable of handling generalization under limited labeled source data. To this end, we propose UniCrossFi, a unified framework designed to mitigate performance drop in CSI-based sensing across diverse deployment settings. Our framework not only extends conventional Domain Generalization (DG) to a more practical Semi-Supervised Domain Generalization (SSDG) setting, where only partially labeled source data are available, but also introduces a physics-informed data augmentation strategy, Antenna Response Consistency (ARC). ARC mitigates the risk of learning superficial shortcuts by exploiting the intrinsic spatial diversity of multi-antenna systems, treating signals from different antennas as naturally augmented views of the same event. In addition, we design a Unified Contrastive Objective to prevent conventional contrastive learning from pushing apart samples from different domains that share the same class. We conduct extensive experiments on the public Widar and CSIDA datasets. The results demonstrate that UniCrossFi consistently establishes a new state-of-the-art, significantly outperforming existing methods across all unsupervised domain adaptation, DG, and SSDG benchmarks. UniCrossFi provides a principled and practical solution to the domain shift challenge, advancing the feasibility of robust, real-world Wi-Fi sensing systems that can operate effectively with limited labeled data.

Title: Limitations of Data-Driven Spectral Reconstruction -- An Optics-Aware Analysis
Authors: Qiang Fu, Matheus Souza, Eunsue Choi, Suhyun Shin, Seung-Hwan Baek, Wolfgang Heidrich
Abstract: Hyperspectral imaging empowers machine vision systems with the distinct capability of identifying materials through recording their spectral signatures. Recent efforts in data-driven spectral reconstruction aim at extracting spectral information from RGB images captured by cost-effective RGB cameras, instead of dedicated hardware. Published work reports exceedingly high numerical scores for this reconstruction task, yet real-world performance lags substantially behind. We systematically analyze the performance of such methods. First, we evaluate the overfitting limitations with respect to current datasets by training the networks with less data, validating the trained models with unseen yet slightly modified data and cross-dataset validation. Second, we reveal fundamental limitations in the ability of RGB to spectral methods to deal with metameric or near-metameric conditions, which have so far gone largely unnoticed due to the insufficiencies of existing datasets. We validate the trained models with metamer data generated by metameric black theory and re-training the networks with various forms of metamers. This methodology can also be used for data augmentation as a partial mitigation of the dataset issues, although the RGB to spectral inverse problem remains fundamentally ill-posed. Finally, we analyze the potential for modifying the problem setting to achieve better performance by exploiting optical encoding provided by either optical aberrations or deliberate optical design. Our experiments show such approaches provide improved results under certain circumstances, but their overall performance is limited by the same dataset issues. We conclude that future progress on snapshot spectral imaging will heavily depend on the generation of improved datasets which can then be used to design effective optical encoding strategies.

Title: Optimal control of stochastic reaction networks with entropic control cost and emergence of mode-switching strategies
Authors: Shuhei A. Horiguchi, Tetsuya J. Kobayashi
Abstract: Controlling the stochastic dynamics of biological populations is a challenge that arises across various biological contexts. However, these dynamics are inherently nonlinear and involve a discrete state space, i.e., the number of molecules, cells, or organisms. Additionally, the possibility of extinction has a significant impact on both dynamics and control strategies, particularly when the population size is small. These factors hamper the direct application of conventional control theories to biological systems. To address these challenges, we formulate the optimal control problem for stochastic population dynamics by utilizing control cost functions based on the f-divergence, which naturally accounts for population-specific factors. If Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence is adopted for the cost function, the complex nonlinear Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation is simplified into a linear form, facilitating efficient computation of optimal solutions. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the control of interacting random walkers, Moran processes, and SIR models, and observe the mode-switching phenomena in the control strategies. Our approach provides new opportunities for applying control theory to a wide range of biological problems.

Title: Improvement of Spiking Neural Network with Bit Planes and Color Models
Authors: Nhan T. Luu, Duong T. Luu, Nam N. Pham, Thang C. Truong
Abstract: Spiking neural network (SNN) has emerged as a promising paradigm in computational neuroscience and artificial intelligence, offering advantages such as low energy consumption and small memory footprint. However, their practical adoption is constrained by several challenges, prominently among them being performance optimization. In this study, we present a novel approach to enhance the performance of SNN for images through a new coding method that exploits bit plane representation. Our proposed technique is designed to improve the accuracy of SNN without increasing model size. Also, we investigate the impacts of color models of the proposed coding process. Through extensive experimental validation, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our coding strategy in achieving performance gain across multiple datasets. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first research that considers bit planes and color models in the context of SNN. By leveraging the unique characteristics of bit planes, we hope to unlock new potentials in SNNs performance, potentially paving the way for more efficient and effective SNNs models in future researches and applications.

Title: Axial current as the origin of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum
Authors: Orkash Amat, Nurimangul Nurmamat, Yong-Feng Huang, Cheng-Ming Li, Jin-Jun Geng, Chen-Ran Hu, Ze-Cheng Zou, Xiao-Fei Dong, Chen Deng, Fan Xu, Xiao-li Zhang, Chen Du
Abstract: We show that the axial current density is the physical origin (generator) of quantum intrinsic orbital angular momentum (IOAM). Without the axial current, the IOAM of particles vanishes. Broadly speaking, we argue that the spiral or interference characteristics of the axial current density determine the occurrence of nonlinear or tunneling effects in any spacetime-dependent quantum systems. Our findings offer a comprehensive theoretical framework that addresses the limitations of Keldysh's ionization theory and provides new insights into the angular momentum properties of quantum systems, particularly in tunneling-dominated regimes. Using Wigner function methods, fermionic generalized two-level model, and Berry phase simulations, we predict that IOAM effect can persist even in pure quantum tunneling processes. These results open the door for experimental verification of IOAM effects in future high-intensity QED experiments, such as those using X-ray free electron lasers.

Title: Nexus: An Omni-Perceptive And -Interactive Model for Language, Audio, And Vision
Authors: Che Liu, Yingji Zhang, Dong Zhang, Weijie Zhang, Chenggong Gong, Yu Lu, Shilin Zhou, Ziliang Gan, Ziao Wang, Haipang Wu, Ji Liu, André Freitas, Qifan Wang, Zenglin Xu, Rongjuncheng Zhang, Yong Dai
Abstract: This work proposes an industry-level omni-modal large language model (LLM) pipeline that integrates auditory, visual, and linguistic modalities to overcome challenges such as limited tri-modal datasets, high computational costs, and complex feature alignments. Our pipeline consists of three main components: First, a modular framework enabling flexible configuration of various encoder-LLM-decoder architectures. Second, a lightweight training strategy that pre-trains audio-language alignment on the state-of-the-art vision-language model Qwen2.5-VL, thus avoiding the costly pre-training of vision-specific modalities. Third, an audio synthesis pipeline that generates high-quality audio-text data from diverse real-world scenarios, supporting applications such as Automatic Speech Recognition and Speech-to-Speech chat. To this end, we introduce an industry-level omni-modal LLM, Nexus. Extensive experiments validate the efficacy of our pipeline, yielding the following key findings:(1) In the visual understanding task, Nexus exhibits superior performance compared with its backbone model - Qwen2.5-VL-7B, validating the efficiency of our training strategy. (2) Within the English Spoken Question-Answering task, the model achieves better accuracy than the same-period competitor (i.e, MiniCPM-o2.6-7B) in the LLaMA Q. benchmark. (3) In our real-world ASR testset, Nexus achieves outstanding performance, indicating its robustness in real scenarios. (4) In the Speech-to-Text Translation task, our model outperforms Qwen2-Audio-Instruct-7B. (5) In the Text-to-Speech task, based on pretrained vocoder (e.g., Fishspeech1.4 or CosyVoice2.0), Nexus is comparable to its backbone vocoder on Seed-TTS benchmark. (6) An in-depth analysis of tri-modal alignment reveals that incorporating the audio modality enhances representational alignment between vision and language.

Title: Whole-Body Model-Predictive Control of Legged Robots with MuJoCo
Authors: John Z. Zhang, Taylor A. Howell, Zeji Yi, Chaoyi Pan, Guanya Shi, Guannan Qu, Tom Erez, Yuval Tassa, Zachary Manchester
Abstract: We demonstrate the surprising real-world effectiveness of a very simple approach to whole-body model-predictive control (MPC) of quadruped and humanoid robots: the iterative LQR (iLQR) algorithm with MuJoCo dynamics and finite-difference approximated derivatives. Building upon the previous success of model-based behavior synthesis and control of locomotion and manipulation tasks with MuJoCo in simulation, we show that these policies can easily generalize to the real world with few sim-to-real considerations. Our baseline method achieves real-time whole-body MPC on a variety of hardware experiments, including dynamic quadruped locomotion, quadruped walking on two legs, and full-sized humanoid bipedal locomotion. We hope this easy-to-reproduce hardware baseline lowers the barrier to entry for real-world whole-body MPC research and contributes to accelerating research velocity in the community.

Title: Late Fusion and Multi-Level Fission Amplify Cross-Modal Transfer in Text-Speech LMs
Authors: Santiago Cuervo, Adel Moumen, Yanis Labrak, Sameer Khurana, Antoine Laurent, Mickael Rouvier, Phil Woodland, Ricard Marxer
Abstract: Text-Speech Language Models (TSLMs) -- language models trained to jointly process and generate text and speech -- are commonly trained through an early modality fusion/fission approach, in which both modalities are fed and predicted from a shared backbone via linear layers. We hypothesize that this approach limits cross-modal transfer by neglecting feature compositionality -- specifically, the finer-grained nature of speech representations compared to text -- preventing the emergence of a shared feature hierarchy within model layers. In this paper, we argue that this limitation can be addressed through late fusion and fission, with a fission process that accesses both high- and low-level features for speech generation. Our models implementing these principles, SmolTolk, rival or surpass state-of-the-art TSLMs trained with orders of magnitude more compute, and achieve significantly improved cross-modal performance relative to early fusion/fission baselines. Representation analyses further suggest that our method enhances the model's ability to abstract higher-level, more semantic features from speech, and leads to increasingly shared representation spaces across layers.

Title: Subgradient Method for System Identification with Non-Smooth Objectives
Authors: Baturalp Yalcin, Jihun Kim, Javad Lavaei
Abstract: This paper investigates a subgradient-based algorithm to solve the system identification problem for linear time-invariant systems with non-smooth objectives. This is essential for robust system identification in safety-critical applications. While existing work provides theoretical exact recovery guarantees using optimization solvers, the design of fast learning algorithms with convergence guarantees for practical use remains unexplored. We analyze the subgradient method in this setting, where the optimization problems to be solved evolve over time as new measurements are collected, and we establish linear convergence to the ground-truth system for both the best and Polyak step sizes after a burn-in period. We further characterize sublinear convergence of the iterates under constant and diminishing step sizes, which require only minimal information and thus offer broad applicability. Finally, we compare the time complexity of standard solvers with the subgradient algorithm and support our findings with experimental results. This is the first work to analyze subgradient algorithms for system identification with non-smooth objectives.

Title: Physics-Informed Deep B-Spline Networks
Authors: Zhuoyuan Wang, Raffaele Romagnoli, Saviz Mowlavi, Yorie Nakahira
Abstract: Physics-informed machine learning offers a promising framework for solving complex partial differential equations (PDEs) by integrating observational data with governing physical laws. However, learning PDEs with varying parameters and changing initial conditions and boundary conditions (ICBCs) with theoretical guarantees remains an open challenge. In this paper, we propose physics-informed deep B-spline networks, a novel technique that approximates a family of PDEs with different parameters and ICBCs by learning B-spline control points through neural networks. The proposed B-spline representation reduces the learning task from predicting solution values over the entire domain to learning a compact set of control points, enforces strict compliance to initial and Dirichlet boundary conditions by construction, and enables analytical computation of derivatives for incorporating PDE residual losses. While existing approximation and generalization theories are not applicable in this setting - where solutions of parametrized PDE families are represented via B-spline bases - we fill this gap by showing that B-spline networks are universal approximators for such families under mild conditions. We also derive generalization error bounds for physics-informed learning in both elliptic and parabolic PDE settings, establishing new theoretical guarantees. Finally, we demonstrate in experiments that the proposed technique has improved efficiency-accuracy tradeoffs compared to existing techniques in a dynamical system problem with discontinuous ICBCs and can handle nonhomogeneous ICBCs and non-rectangular domains.

Title: Sum Rate Maximization for NOMA-Assisted Uplink Pinching-Antenna Systems
Authors: Ming Zeng, Ji Wang, Xingwang Li, Gongpu Wang, Octavia A. Dobre, Zhiguo Ding
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate an uplink communication scenario in which multiple users communicate with an access point (AP) employing non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). A pinching antenna, which can be activated at an arbitrary point along a dielectric waveguide, is deployed at the AP to dynamically reconfigure user channels. The objective is to maximize the system sum rate by jointly optimizing the pinching-antenna's position and the users' transmit powers. Two scenarios are considered: one without quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees, and the other with QoS guarantees. In the former case, users transmit at full power, and the antenna position is determined using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. In the latter, an alternating optimization approach is adopted, where a low-complexity solution is derived for power allocation, and a modified PSO algorithm is applied to optimize the antenna position. Numerical results show that the proposed pinching-antenna-assisted system significantly improves the sum rate compared to the conventional fixed-antenna architecture. Furthermore, the NOMA-based approach consistently outperforms its TDMA-based counterpart. Finally, the proposed PSO-based method achieves near-optimal performance, particularly when the QoS constraints are moderate.

Title: MGE-LDM: Joint Latent Diffusion for Simultaneous Music Generation and Source Extraction
Authors: Yunkee Chae, Kyogu Lee
Abstract: We present MGE-LDM, a unified latent diffusion framework for simultaneous music generation, source imputation, and query-driven source separation. Unlike prior approaches constrained to fixed instrument classes, MGE-LDM learns a joint distribution over full mixtures, submixtures, and individual stems within a single compact latent diffusion model. At inference, MGE-LDM enables (1) complete mixture generation, (2) partial generation (i.e., source imputation), and (3) text-conditioned extraction of arbitrary sources. By formulating both separation and imputation as conditional inpainting tasks in the latent space, our approach supports flexible, class-agnostic manipulation of arbitrary instrument sources. Notably, MGE-LDM can be trained jointly across heterogeneous multi-track datasets (e.g., Slakh2100, MUSDB18, MoisesDB) without relying on predefined instrument categories.

Title: CoVoMix2: Advancing Zero-Shot Dialogue Generation with Fully Non-Autoregressive Flow Matching
Authors: Leying Zhang, Yao Qian, Xiaofei Wang, Manthan Thakker, Dongmei Wang, Jianwei Yu, Haibin Wu, Yuxuan Hu, Jinyu Li, Yanmin Qian, Sheng Zhao
Abstract: Generating natural-sounding, multi-speaker dialogue is crucial for applications such as podcast creation, virtual agents, and multimedia content generation. However, existing systems struggle to maintain speaker consistency, model overlapping speech, and synthesize coherent conversations efficiently. In this paper, we introduce CoVoMix2, a fully non-autoregressive framework for zero-shot multi-talker dialogue generation. CoVoMix2 directly predicts mel-spectrograms from multi-stream transcriptions using a flow-matching-based generative model, eliminating the reliance on intermediate token representations. To better capture realistic conversational dynamics, we propose transcription-level speaker disentanglement, sentence-level alignment, and prompt-level random masking strategies. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art performance, outperforming strong baselines like MoonCast and Sesame in speech quality, speaker consistency, and inference speed. Notably, CoVoMix2 operates without requiring transcriptions for the prompt and supports controllable dialogue generation, including overlapping speech and precise timing control, demonstrating strong generalizability to real-world speech generation scenarios.

Title: Reliable Wireless Indoor Localization via Cross-Validated Prediction-Powered Calibration
Authors: Seonghoon Yoo, Houssem Sifaou, Sangwoo Park, Joonhyuk Kang, Osvaldo Simeone
Abstract: Wireless indoor localization using predictive models with received signal strength information (RSSI) requires proper calibration for reliable position estimates. One remedy is to employ synthetic labels produced by a (generally different) predictive model. But fine-tuning an additional predictor, as well as estimating residual bias of the synthetic labels, demands additional data, aggravating calibration data scarcity in wireless environments. This letter proposes an approach that efficiently uses limited calibration data to simultaneously fine-tune a predictor and estimate the bias of synthetic labels, yielding prediction sets with rigorous coverage guarantees. Experiments on a fingerprinting dataset validate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: VGGSounder: Audio-Visual Evaluations for Foundation Models
Authors: Daniil Zverev, Thaddäus Wiedemer, Ameya Prabhu, Matthias Bethge, Wieland Brendel, A. Sophia Koepke
Abstract: The emergence of audio-visual foundation models underscores the importance of reliably assessing their multi-modal understanding. The VGGSound dataset is commonly used as a benchmark for evaluation audio-visual classification. However, our analysis identifies several limitations of VGGSound, including incomplete labelling, partially overlapping classes, and misaligned modalities. These lead to distorted evaluations of auditory and visual capabilities. To address these limitations, we introduce VGGSounder, a comprehensively re-annotated, multi-label test set that extends VGGSound and is specifically designed to evaluate audio-visual foundation models. VGGSounder features detailed modality annotations, enabling precise analyses of modality-specific performance. Furthermore, we reveal model limitations by analysing performance degradation when adding another input modality with our new modality confusion metric.

Title: Speech Foundation Models Generalize to Time Series Tasks from Wearable Sensor Data
Authors: Jaya Narain, Zakaria Aldeneh, Shirley Ren
Abstract: Both speech and sensor time series data encode information in both the time- and frequency- domains, like spectral powers and waveform shapelets. We show that speech foundation models learn representations that generalize beyond the speech domain and achieve state-of-the-art performance on diverse time-series tasks from wearable sensors. Probes trained on features extracted from HuBERT and wav2vec 2.0 outperform those extracted from self-supervised models trained directly on modality-specific datasets for mood classification, arrhythmia detection, and activity classification tasks. We find that the convolutional feature encoders of speech models are particularly relevant for wearable sensor applications. The proposed approach enhances performance on data-scarce time-series tasks using simple probing methods. This work takes a step toward developing generalized time-series models that unify speech and sensor modalities.

Title: Normative Modelling in Neuroimaging: A Practical Guide for Researchers
Authors: Nida Alyas, Jonathan Horsley, Bethany Little, Peter N. Taylor, Yujiang Wang, Karoline Leiberg
Abstract: Normative modelling is an increasingly common statistical technique in neuroimaging that estimates population-level benchmarks in brain structure. It enables the quantification of individual deviations from expected distributions whilst accounting for biological and technical covariates without requiring large, matched control groups. This makes it a powerful alternative to traditional case-control studies for identifying brain structural alterations associated with pathology. Despite the availability of numerous modelling approaches and several toolboxes with pre-trained models, the distinct strengths and limitations of normative modelling make it difficult to determine how and when to implement them appropriately. This review offers practical guidance and outlines statistical considerations for clinical researchers using normative modelling in neuroimaging. Through a worked example using clinical epilepsy data, we outline considerations for responsible implementation of pre-trained normative models, to support their broad and rigorous adoption in neuroimaging research.

Title: Guided Multi-Fidelity Bayesian Optimization for Data-driven Controller Tuning with Digital Twins
Authors: Mahdi Nobar, Jürg Keller, Alessandro Forino, John Lygeros, Alisa Rupenyan
Abstract: We propose a \textit{guided multi-fidelity Bayesian optimization} framework for data-efficient controller tuning that integrates corrected digital twin simulations with real-world measurements. The method targets closed-loop systems with limited-fidelity simulations or inexpensive approximations. To address model mismatch, we build a multi-fidelity surrogate with a learned correction model that refines digital twin estimates using real data. An adaptive cost-aware acquisition function balances expected improvement, fidelity, and sampling cost. Our method ensures adaptability as new measurements arrive. The digital twin accuracy is re-estimated, dynamically adapting both cross-source correlations and the acquisition function. This ensures that accurate simulations are used more frequently, while inaccurate simulation data are appropriately downweighted. Experiments on robotic drive hardware and supporting numerical studies demonstrate that our method enhances tuning efficiency compared to standard Bayesian optimization and multi-fidelity methods.

Title: SHANKS: Simultaneous Hearing and Thinking for Spoken Language Models
Authors: Cheng-Han Chiang, Xiaofei Wang, Linjie Li, Chung-Ching Lin, Kevin Lin, Shujie Liu, Zhendong Wang, Zhengyuan Yang, Hung-yi Lee, Lijuan Wang
Abstract: Current large language models (LLMs) and spoken language models (SLMs) begin thinking and taking actions only after the user has finished their turn. This prevents the model from interacting during the user's turn and can lead to high response latency while it waits to think. Consequently, thinking after receiving the full input is not suitable for speech-to-speech interaction, where real-time, low-latency exchange is important. We address this by noting that humans naturally "think while listening." In this paper, we propose SHANKS, a general inference framework that enables SLMs to generate unspoken chain-of-thought reasoning while listening to the user input. SHANKS streams the input speech in fixed-duration chunks and, as soon as a chunk is received, generates unspoken reasoning based on all previous speech and reasoning, while the user continues speaking. SHANKS uses this unspoken reasoning to decide whether to interrupt the user and to make tool calls to complete the task. We demonstrate that SHANKS enhances real-time user-SLM interaction in two scenarios: (1) when the user is presenting a step-by-step solution to a math problem, SHANKS can listen, reason, and interrupt when the user makes a mistake, achieving 37.1% higher interruption accuracy than a baseline that interrupts without thinking; and (2) in a tool-augmented dialogue, SHANKS can complete 56.9% of the tool calls before the user finishes their turn. Overall, SHANKS moves toward models that keep thinking throughout the conversation, not only after a turn ends. Animated illustrations of Shanks can be found at this https URL

Title: Architecture Is All You Need: Diversity-Enabled Sweet Spots for Robust Humanoid Locomotion
Authors: Blake Werner, Lizhi Yang, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Robust humanoid locomotion in unstructured environments requires architectures that balance fast low-level stabilization with slower perceptual decision-making. We show that a simple layered control architecture (LCA), a proprioceptive stabilizer running at high rate, coupled with a compact low-rate perceptual policy, enables substantially more robust performance than monolithic end-to-end designs, even when using minimal perception encoders. Through a two-stage training curriculum (blind stabilizer pretraining followed by perceptual fine-tuning), we demonstrate that layered policies consistently outperform one-stage alternatives in both simulation and hardware. On a Unitree G1 humanoid, our approach succeeds across stair and ledge tasks where one-stage perceptual policies fail. These results highlight that architectural separation of timescales, rather than network scale or complexity, is the key enabler for robust perception-conditioned locomotion.

Title: CBF-RL: Safety Filtering Reinforcement Learning in Training with Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Lizhi Yang, Blake Werner, Massimiliano de Sa, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Reinforcement learning (RL), while powerful and expressive, can often prioritize performance at the expense of safety. Yet safety violations can lead to catastrophic outcomes in real-world deployments. Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) offer a principled method to enforce dynamic safety -- traditionally deployed online via safety filters. While the result is safe behavior, the fact that the RL policy does not have knowledge of the CBF can lead to conservative behaviors. This paper proposes CBF-RL, a framework for generating safe behaviors with RL by enforcing CBFs in training. CBF-RL has two key attributes: (1) minimally modifying a nominal RL policy to encode safety constraints via a CBF term, (2) and safety filtering of the policy rollouts in training. Theoretically, we prove that continuous-time safety filters can be deployed via closed-form expressions on discrete-time roll-outs. Practically, we demonstrate that CBF-RL internalizes the safety constraints in the learned policy -- both enforcing safer actions and biasing towards safer rewards -- enabling safe deployment without the need for an online safety filter. We validate our framework through ablation studies on navigation tasks and on the Unitree G1 humanoid robot, where CBF-RL enables safer exploration, faster convergence, and robust performance under uncertainty, enabling the humanoid robot to avoid obstacles and climb stairs safely in real-world settings without a runtime safety filter.
