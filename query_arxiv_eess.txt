Title: A Hierarchical Signal Coordination and Control System Using a Hybrid Model-based and Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Xianyue Peng, Shenyang Chen, H. Michael Zhang
Abstract: Signal control in urban corridors faces the dual challenge of maintaining arterial traffic progression while adapting to demand variations at local intersections. We propose a hierarchical traffic signal coordination and control scheme that integrates model-based optimization with reinforcement learning. The system consists of: (i) a High-Level Coordinator (HLC) that selects coordination strategies based on observed and predicted demand; (ii) a Corridor Coordinator that derives phase constraints from the selected strategy-either Max-Flow Coordination (MFC) or Green-Wave Coordination (GWC); and (iii) Hybrid Signal Agents (HSAs) that determine signal phases via reinforcement learning with action masking to enforce feasibility. Hierarchical reinforcement learning with Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) is used to train HSA and HLC policies. At the lower level, three HSA policies-MFC-aware, GWC-aware, and pure agent control (PAC) are trained in conjunction with their respective coordination strategies. At the higher level, the HLC is trained to dynamically switch strategies using a multi-objective reward balancing corridor-level and network-wide performance. The proposed scheme was developed and evaluated on a SUMO-RLlib platform. Case results show that hybrid MFC maximizes throughput under heavy demand; hybrid GWC consistently minimizes arterial stops and maintains progression across diverse traffic conditions but can reduce network-wide efficiency; and PAC improves network-wide travel time in moderate demand but is less effective under heavy demand. The hierarchical design enables adaptive strategy selection, achieving robust performance across all demand levels.

Title: A Machine Learning Approach to Volumetric Computations of Solid Pulmonary Nodules
Authors: Yihan Zhou, Haocheng Huang, Yue Yu, Jianhui Shang
Abstract: Early detection of lung cancer is crucial for effective treatment and relies on accurate volumetric assessment of pulmonary nodules in CT scans. Traditional methods, such as consolidation-to-tumor ratio (CTR) and spherical approximation, are limited by inconsistent estimates due to variability in nodule shape and density. We propose an advanced framework that combines a multi-scale 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) with subtype-specific bias correction for precise volume estimation. The model was trained and evaluated on a dataset of 364 cases from Shanghai Chest Hospital. Our approach achieved a mean absolute deviation of 8.0 percent compared to manual nonlinear regression, with inference times under 20 seconds per scan. This method outperforms existing deep learning and semi-automated pipelines, which typically have errors of 25 to 30 percent and require over 60 seconds for processing. Our results show a reduction in error by over 17 percentage points and a threefold acceleration in processing speed. These advancements offer a highly accurate, efficient, and scalable tool for clinical lung nodule screening and monitoring, with promising potential for improving early lung cancer detection.

Title: Data-Efficient Point Cloud Semantic Segmentation Pipeline for Unimproved Roads
Authors: Andrew Yarovoi, Christopher R. Valenta
Abstract: In this case study, we present a data-efficient point cloud segmentation pipeline and training framework for robust segmentation of unimproved roads and seven other classes. Our method employs a two-stage training framework: first, a projection-based convolutional neural network is pre-trained on a mixture of public urban datasets and a small, curated in-domain dataset; then, a lightweight prediction head is fine-tuned exclusively on in-domain data. Along the way, we explore the application of Point Prompt Training to batch normalization layers and the effects of Manifold Mixup as a regularizer within our pipeline. We also explore the effects of incorporating histogram-normalized ambients to further boost performance. Using only 50 labeled point clouds from our target domain, we show that our proposed training approach improves mean Intersection-over-Union from 33.5% to 51.8% and the overall accuracy from 85.5% to 90.8%, when compared to naive training on the in-domain data. Crucially, our results demonstrate that pre-training across multiple datasets is key to improving generalization and enabling robust segmentation under limited in-domain supervision. Overall, this study demonstrates a practical framework for robust 3D semantic segmentation in challenging, low-data scenarios. Our code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Global Motion Corresponder for 3D Point-Based Scene Interpolation under Large Motion
Authors: Junru Lin, Chirag Vashist, Mikaela Angelina Uy, Colton Stearns, Xuan Luo, Leonidas Guibas, Ke Li
Abstract: Existing dynamic scene interpolation methods typically assume that the motion between consecutive timesteps is small enough so that displacements can be locally approximated by linear models. In practice, even slight deviations from this small-motion assumption can cause conventional techniques to fail. In this paper, we introduce Global Motion Corresponder (GMC), a novel approach that robustly handles large motion and achieves smooth transitions. GMC learns unary potential fields that predict SE(3) mappings into a shared canonical space, balancing correspondence, spatial and semantic smoothness, and local rigidity. We demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms existing baselines on 3D scene interpolation when the two states undergo large global motions. Furthermore, our method enables extrapolation capabilities where other baseline methods cannot.

Title: Is the medical image segmentation problem solved? A survey of current developments and future directions
Authors: Guoping Xu, Jayaram K. Udupa, Jax Luo, Songlin Zhao, Yajun Yu, Scott B. Raymond, Hao Peng, Lipeng Ning, Yogesh Rathi, Wei Liu, You Zhang
Abstract: Medical image segmentation has advanced rapidly over the past two decades, largely driven by deep learning, which has enabled accurate and efficient delineation of cells, tissues, organs, and pathologies across diverse imaging modalities. This progress raises a fundamental question: to what extent have current models overcome persistent challenges, and what gaps remain? In this work, we provide an in-depth review of medical image segmentation, tracing its progress and key developments over the past decade. We examine core principles, including multiscale analysis, attention mechanisms, and the integration of prior knowledge, across the encoder, bottleneck, skip connections, and decoder components of segmentation networks. Our discussion is organized around seven key dimensions: (1) the shift from supervised to semi-/unsupervised learning, (2) the transition from organ segmentation to lesion-focused tasks, (3) advances in multi-modality integration and domain adaptation, (4) the role of foundation models and transfer learning, (5) the move from deterministic to probabilistic segmentation, (6) the progression from 2D to 3D and 4D segmentation, and (7) the trend from model invocation to segmentation agents. Together, these perspectives provide a holistic overview of the trajectory of deep learning-based medical image segmentation and aim to inspire future innovation.

Title: UltraEar: a multicentric, large-scale database combining ultra-high-resolution computed tomography and clinical data for ear diseases
Authors: Ruowei Tang, Pengfei Zhao, Xiaoguang Li, Ning Xu, Yue Cheng, Mengshi Zhang, Zhixiang Wang, Zhengyu Zhang, Hongxia Yin, Heyu Ding, Shusheng Gong, Yuhe Liu, Zhenchang Wang
Abstract: Ear diseases affect billions of people worldwide, leading to substantial health and socioeconomic burdens. Computed tomography (CT) plays a pivotal role in accurate diagnosis, treatment planning, and outcome evaluation. The objective of this study is to present the establishment and design of UltraEar Database, a large-scale, multicentric repository of isotropic 0.1 mm ultra-high-resolution CT (U-HRCT) images and associated clinical data dedicated to ear diseases. UltraEar recruits patients from 11 tertiary hospitals between October 2020 and October 2035, integrating U-HRCT images, structured CT reports, and comprehensive clinical information, including demographics, audiometric profiles, surgical records, and pathological findings. A broad spectrum of otologic disorders is covered, such as otitis media, cholesteatoma, ossicular chain malformation, temporal bone fracture, inner ear malformation, cochlear aperture stenosis, enlarged vestibular aqueduct, and sigmoid sinus bony deficiency. Standardized preprocessing pipelines have been developed for geometric calibration, image annotation, and multi-structure segmentation. All personal identifiers in DICOM headers and metadata are removed or anonymized to ensure compliance with data privacy regulation. Data collection and curation are coordinated through monthly expert panel meetings, with secure storage on an offline cloud system. UltraEar provides an unprecedented ultra-high-resolution reference atlas with both technical fidelity and clinical relevance. This resource has significant potential to advance radiological research, enable development and validation of AI algorithms, serve as an educational tool for training in otologic imaging, and support multi-institutional collaborative studies. UltraEar will be continuously updated and expanded, ensuring long-term accessibility and usability for the global otologic research community.

Title: Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Motion Planning for Autonomous Racing
Authors: Francesco Prignoli, Francesco Borrelli, Paolo Falcone, Mark Pustilnik
Abstract: This paper presents a regulation-aware motion planning framework for autonomous racing scenarios. Each agent solves a Regulation-Compliant Model Predictive Control problem, where racing rules - such as right-of-way and collision avoidance responsibilities - are encoded using Mixed Logical Dynamical constraints. We formalize the interaction between vehicles as a Generalized Nash Equilibrium Problem (GNEP) and approximate its solution using an Iterative Best Response scheme. Building on this, we introduce the Regulation-Aware Game-Theoretic Planner (RA-GTP), in which the attacker reasons over the defender's regulation-constrained behavior. This game-theoretic layer enables the generation of overtaking strategies that are both safe and non-conservative. Simulation results demonstrate that the RA-GTP outperforms baseline methods that assume non-interacting or rule-agnostic opponent models, leading to more effective maneuvers while consistently maintaining compliance with racing regulations.

Title: Efficient and Privacy-Protecting Background Removal for 2D Video Streaming using iPhone 15 Pro Max LiDAR
Authors: Jessica Kinnevan, Naifa Alqahtani, Toral Chauhan
Abstract: Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) technology in consumer-grade mobile devices can be used as a replacement for traditional background removal and compositing techniques. Unlike approaches such as chroma keying and trained AI models, LiDAR's depth information is independent of subject lighting, and performs equally well in low-light and well-lit environments. We integrate the LiDAR and color cameras on the iPhone 15 Pro Max with GPU-based image processing. We use Apple's SwiftUI and Swift frameworks for user interface and backend development, and Metal Shader Language (MSL) for realtime image enhancement at the standard iPhone streaming frame rate of 60 frames per second. The only meaningful limitations of the technology are the streaming bandwidth of the depth data, which currently reduces the depth map resolution to 320x240, and any pre-existing limitations of the LiDAR IR laser to reflect accurate depth from some materials. If the LiDAR resolution on a mobile device like the iPhone can be improved to match the color image resolution, LiDAR could feasibly become the preeminent method of background removal for video applications and photography.

Authors: Yujin Kim, Richa Namballa, Magdalena Fuentes
Abstract: K-pop's global success is fueled by its dynamic performances and vibrant fan engagement. Inspired by K-pop fan culture, we propose a methodology for automatically extracting live vocals from performances. We use a combination of source separation, cross-correlation, and amplitude scaling to automatically remove pre-recorded vocals and instrumentals from a live performance. Our preliminary work introduces the task of live vocal separation and provides a foundation for future research in this topic.

Title: Error Analysis for Over-the-Air Federated Learning under Misaligned and Time-Varying Channels
Authors: Xiaoyan Ma, Shahryar Zehtabi, Taejoon Kim, Christopher G. Brinton
Abstract: This paper investigates an OFDM-based over-the-air federated learning (OTA-FL) system, where multiple mobile devices, e.g., unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), transmit local machine learning (ML) models to a central parameter server (PS) for global model aggregation. The high mobility of local devices results in imperfect channel estimation, leading to a misalignment problem, i.e., the model parameters transmitted from different local devices do not arrive at the central PS simultaneously. Moreover, the mobility introduces time-varying uploading channels, which further complicates the aggregation process. All these factors collectively cause distortions in the OTA-FL training process which are underexplored. To quantify these effects, we first derive a closed-form expression for a single-round global model update in terms of these channel imperfections. We then extend our analysis to capture multiple rounds of global updates, yielding a bound on the accumulated error in OTA-FL. We validate our theoretical results via extensive numerical simulations, which corroborate our derived analysis.

Title: Neural Spline Operators for Risk Quantification in Stochastic Systems
Authors: Zhuoyuan Wang, Raffaele Romagnoli, Kamyar Azizzadenesheli, Yorie Nakahira
Abstract: Accurately quantifying long-term risk probabilities in diverse stochastic systems is essential for safety-critical control. However, existing sampling-based and partial differential equation (PDE)-based methods often struggle to handle complex varying dynamics. Physics-informed neural networks learn surrogate mappings for risk probabilities from varying system parameters of fixed and finite dimensions, yet can not account for functional variations in system dynamics. To address these challenges, we introduce physics-informed neural operator (PINO) methods to risk quantification problems, to learn mappings from varying \textit{functional} system dynamics to corresponding risk probabilities. Specifically, we propose Neural Spline Operators (NeSO), a PINO framework that leverages B-spline representations to improve training efficiency and achieve better initial and boundary condition enforcements, which are crucial for accurate risk quantification. We provide theoretical analysis demonstrating the universal approximation capability of NeSO. We also present two case studies, one with varying functional dynamics and another with high-dimensional multi-agent dynamics, to demonstrate the efficacy of NeSO and its significant online speed-up over existing methods. The proposed framework and the accompanying universal approximation theorem are expected to be beneficial for other control or PDE-related problems beyond risk quantification.

Title: Systolic Array-based Architecture for Low-Bit Integerized Vision Transformers
Authors: Ching-Yi Lin, Sahil Shah
Abstract: Transformer-based models are becoming more and more intelligent and are revolutionizing a wide range of human tasks. To support their deployment, AI labs offer inference services that consume hundreds of GWh of energy annually and charge users based on the number of tokens processed. Under this cost model, minimizing power consumption and maximizing throughput have become key design goals for the inference hardware. While graphics processing units (GPUs) are commonly used, their flexibility comes at the cost of low operational intensity and limited efficiency, especially under the high query-per-model ratios of modern inference services. In this work, we address these challenges by proposing a low-bit, model-specialized accelerator that strategically selects tasks with high operation (OP) reuse and minimal communication overhead for offloading. Our design incorporates multiple systolic arrays with deep, fine-grained pipelines and array-compatible units that support essential operations in multi-head self-attention (MSA) module. At the accelerator-level, each self-attention (SA) head is pipelined within a single accelerator to increase data reuse and further minimize bandwidth. Our 3-bit integerized model achieves 96.83% accuracy on CIFAR-10 and 77.81% top-1 accuracy on ImageNet. We validate the hardware design on a 16nm FPGA (Alveo U250), where it delivers 13,568 GigaOps/second (GOPs/s) and 219.4 GOPs/s/W. Compared to a same-technology GPU (GTX 1080), our design offers 1.50x higher throughput and 4.47x better power efficiency. Even against a state-of-the-art GPU (RTX 5090), we still achieve 20% better power efficiency despite having 87% lower throughput.

Title: Delay-adaptive Control of Nonlinear Systems with Approximate Neural Operator Predictors
Authors: Luke Bhan, Miroslav Krstic, Yuanyuan Shi
Abstract: In this work, we propose a rigorous method for implementing predictor feedback controllers in nonlinear systems with unknown and arbitrarily long actuator delays. To address the analytically intractable nature of the predictor, we approximate it using a learned neural operator mapping. This mapping is trained once, offline, and then deployed online, leveraging the fast inference capabilities of neural networks. We provide a theoretical stability analysis based on the universal approximation theorem of neural operators and the transport partial differential equation (PDE) representation of the delay. We then prove, via a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional, semi-global practical convergence of the dynamical system dependent on the approximation error of the predictor and delay bounds. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a biological activator/repressor system, demonstrating speedups of 15 times compared to traditional numerical methods.

Title: Bootstrap Policy Iteration for Stochastic LQ Tracking with Multiplicative Noise
Authors: Jiayu Chen, Zhenhui Xu, Xinghu Wang
Abstract: This paper studies the optimal tracking control problem for continuous-time stochastic linear systems with multiplicative noise. The solution framework involves solving a stochastic algebraic Riccati equation for the feedback gain and a Sylvester equation for the feedforward gain. To enable model-free optimal tracking, we first develop a two-phase bootstrap policy iteration (B-PI) algorithm, which bootstraps a stabilizing control gain from the trivially initialized zero-value start and proceeds with standard policy iteration. Building on this algorithm, we propose a data-driven, off-policy reinforcement learning approach that ensures convergence to the optimal feedback gain under the interval excitation condition. We further introduce a data-driven method to compute the feedforward using the obtained feedback gain. Additionally, for systems with state-dependent noise, we propose a shadow system-based optimal tracking method to eliminate the need for probing noise. The effectiveness of the proposed methods is demonstrated through numerical examples.

Title: MegaCacheX: Towards Cost-Effective Hierarchical Collaborative Content Caching in Emerging Mega-Constellations
Authors: Haoyang Shi, Xing Zhang, Sitong Li, Minghang Li, Xinming Lu, Shaoxiang Xu, Guoquan Wang
Abstract: Significant latency in global content delivery primarily arises from insufficient terrestrial infrastructure. Deploying space-based content delivery networks within emerging mega-constellations provides an effective means to bridge the digital divide. However, space-based caching faces constraints from physical-layer dynamics, including dynamic topologies, time-varying inter-satellite link conditions, and limited onboard energy. In addition, existing mechanisms often lack fine-grained content categorization and global optimization. This paper proposes MegaCacheX, a cost-effective hierarchical framework for collaborative content distribution that achieves "Earth-independence" by providing cloud services directly from space. Specifically, data centers in Sun-synchronous orbit act as primary content sources, while caching nodes in mega-constellations and ground stations collaboratively form a distributed edge layer. MegaCacheX optimizes caching strategies by integrating content popularity, regional user distribution, and satellite trajectory predictions. Multi-tier caching nodes serve as service anchors, enabling seamless content delivery with low latency. A prototype implemented on a microservices-based, containerized testbed demonstrates that MegaCacheX reduces global content access latency by about 36% compared to baseline approaches, while maintaining cost efficiency.

Title: Unifying Diarization, Separation, and ASR with Multi-Speaker Encoder
Authors: Muhammad Shakeel, Yui Sudo, Yifan Peng, Chyi-Jiunn Lin, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: This paper presents a unified multi-speaker encoder (UME), a novel architecture that jointly learns representations for speaker diarization (SD), speech separation (SS), and multi-speaker automatic speech recognition (ASR) tasks using a shared speech foundational encoder. We leverage the hidden representations from multiple layers of UME as a residual weighted-sum encoding (RWSE) to effectively use information from different semantic levels, contributing to bottom-up alignment between tasks. This joint training approach captures the inherent interdependencies among the tasks, enhancing overall performance on overlapping speech data. Our evaluations demonstrate that UME substantially improves over the single-task baselines dedicated to SD, SS, and multi-speaker ASR on LibriMix evaluation sets. Notably, for SD, UME outperforms the previous studies, achieving diarization error rates of 1.37% and 2.29% on Libri2Mix and Libri3Mix evaluation sets, respectively.

Title: Joint Contact Planning for Navigation and Communication in GNSS-Libration Point Systems
Authors: Huan Yan, Juan A. Fraire, Ziqi Yang, Kanglian Zhao, Wenfeng Li, Xiyun Hou, Haohan Li, Yuxuan Miao, Jinjun Zheng, Chengbin Kang, Huichao Zhou, Xinuo Chang, Lu Wang, Linshan Xue
Abstract: Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon Libration Points (LPs) addresses the inherent deep-space coverage gaps of low-altitude GNSS constellations. Integrating LP satellites with GNSS into a joint constellation enables a more robust and comprehensive Positioning, Navigation, and Timing (PNT) system, while also extending navigation and communication services to spacecraft operating in cislunar space (i.e., users). However, the long propagation delays between LP satellites, users, and GNSS satellites result in significantly different link durations compared to those within the GNSS constellation. Scheduling inter-satellite links (ISLs) is a core task of Contact Plan Design (CPD). Existing CPD approaches focus exclusively on GNSS constellations, assuming uniform link durations, and thus cannot accommodate the heterogeneous link timescales present in a joint GNSS-LP system. To overcome this limitation, we introduce a Joint CPD (J-CPD) scheme tailored to handle ISLs with differing duration units across integrated constellations. The key contributions of J-CPD are: (i):introduction of LongSlots (Earth-Moon scale links) and ShortSlots (GNSS-scale links); (ii):a hierarchical and crossed CPD process for scheduling LongSlots and ShortSlots ISLs; (iii):an energy-driven link scheduling algorithm adapted to the CPD process. Simulations on a joint BeiDou-LP constellation demonstrate that J-CPD surpasses the baseline FCP method in both delay and ranging coverage, while maintaining high user satisfaction and enabling tunable trade-offs through adjustable potential-energy parameters. To our knowledge, this is the first CPD framework to jointly optimize navigation and communication in GNSS-LP systems, representing a key step toward unified and resilient deep-space PNT architectures.

Title: Adaptive Control of Heterogeneous Platoons with Guaranteed Collision Avoidance
Authors: Ashutosh Chandra Pandey, Sayan Basu Roy, Simone Baldi
Abstract: This work proposes a framework for Cooperative Adaptive Cruise Control of a vehicular platoon characterized by unidirectional communication and heterogeneous parameters. In the proposed framework, the actual (heterogeneous) platoon is made to converge to a reference (homogeneous) platoon via adaptive laws designed using of set-theoretic model reference adaptive control. Yet, in contrast to the state-of-art that is based on ensuring collision avoidance on the reference platoon dynamics only, the approach we propose can ensure collision avoidance on the actual platoon dynamics. This result is possible thanks to the introduction of a novel concept of virtual platoon, only used for analysis, but that does not interact with the actual platoon. The stability and convergence properties of the proposed framework are established using Lyapunov-based analysis in conjunction with the aforementioned virtual platoon concept.

Title: Dual-IRS Aided Near-/Hybrid-Field SWIPT: Passive Beamforming and Independent Antenna Power Splitting Design
Authors: Chaoying Huang, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Xusheng Zhu, Zhendong Li, Ying Wang, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near- and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.

Title: Towards Automated EEG-Based Detection Using Deep Convolutional Autoencoders
Authors: Annika Stiehl, Nicolas Weeger, Christian Uhl, Dominic Bechtold, Nicole Ille, Stefan Geißelsöder
Abstract: Epilepsy is one of the most common neurological disorders. This disease requires reliable and efficient seizure detection methods. Electroencephalography (EEG) is the gold standard for seizure monitoring, but its manual analysis is a time-consuming task that requires expert knowledge. In addition, there are no well-defined features that allow fully automated analysis. Existing deep learning-based approaches struggle to achieve high sensitivity while maintaining a low false alarm rate per hour (FAR/h) and lack consistency in the optimal EEG input representation, whether in the time or frequency domain. To address these issues, we propose a Deep Convolutional Autoencoder (DCAE) to extract low-dimensional latent representations that preserve essential EEG signal features. The ability of the model to preserve relevant information was evaluated by comparing reconstruction errors based on both time series and frequency-domain representations. Several autoencoders with different loss functions based on time and frequency were trained and evaluated to determine their effectiveness in reconstructing EEG features. Our results show that the DCAE model taking both time series and frequency losses into account achieved the best reconstruction performance. This indicates that Deep Neural Networks with a single representation might not preserve the relevant signal properties. This work provides insight into how deep learning models process EEG data and examines whether frequency information is captured when time series signals are used as input.

Title: Local Observability of a Class of Feedforward Neural Networks
Authors: Yi Yang, Victor G. Lopez, Matthias A. Müller
Abstract: Beyond the traditional neural network training methods based on gradient descent and its variants, state estimation techniques have been proposed to determine a set of ideal weights from a control-theoretic perspective. Hence, the concept of observability becomes relevant in neural network training. In this paper, we investigate local observability of a class of two-layer feedforward neural networks~(FNNs) with rectified linear unit~(ReLU) activation functions. We analyze local observability of FNNs by evaluating an observability rank condition with respect to the weight matrix and the input sequence. First, we show that, in general, the weights of FNNs are not locally observable. Then, we provide sufficient conditions on the network structures and the weights that lead to local observability. Moreover, we propose an input design approach to render the weights distinguishable and show that this input also excites other weights inside a neighborhood. Finally, we validate our results through a numerical example.

Title: Transient Stability Analysis of a Hybrid Grid-Forming and Grid-Following RES System Considering Multi-Mode Control Switching
Authors: Ruiyuan Zeng, Ruisheng Diao, Fangyuan Sun, Wangqianyun Tang, Junjie Li, Baorong Zhou
Abstract: The inherent control switching of renewable energy sources (RESs) during intricate transient processes introduces complexity to the dynamic behavior of modern power systems. This paper reveals the dynamic coupling between grid forming (GFM)/grid following (GFL)-based RES and dominant instability modes of the hybrid system. First, six control combinations are systematically investigated by pairing the two GFM-RES modes, normal control (NC) and current saturation (CS), with the three GFL-RES modes: normal control, low voltage ride-through (LVRT), and high voltage ride-through (HVRT). Based on switching system theory, the coupled power flow and dynamic motion models are developed considering multi-mode switching characteristics. It is revealed that the hybrid system exhibits two distinct instability modes when the GFM-RES and GFL-RES exceed their P-f and V-f desynchronization boundaries, respectively. The two-dimensional spatiotemporal damping characteristics of GFL-RES induced by GFM-RES are also uncovered for the first time. A novel criterion is proposed to quantify the impact of GFM-RES on GFL-RES dynamics, capturing both its stabilizing and destabilizing effects under different control combinations. High-fidelity electromagnetic transient simulations validate the correctness of the analysis framework.

Title: DMPC-Swarm: Distributed Model Predictive Control on Nano UAV swarms
Authors: Alexander Gräfe, Joram Eickhoff, Marco Zimmerling, Sebastian Trimpe
Abstract: Swarms of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are increasingly becoming vital to our society, undertaking tasks such as search and rescue, surveillance and delivery. A special variant of Distributed Model Predictive Control (DMPC) has emerged as a promising approach for the safe management of these swarms by combining the scalability of distributed computation with dynamic swarm motion control. In this DMPC method, multiple agents solve local optimization problems with coupled anti-collision constraints, periodically exchanging their solutions. Despite its potential, existing methodologies using this DMPC variant have yet to be deployed on distributed hardware that fully utilize true distributed computation and wireless communication. This is primarily due to the lack of a communication system tailored to meet the unique requirements of mobile swarms and an architecture that supports distributed computation while adhering to the payload constraints of UAVs. We present DMPC-SWARM, a new swarm control methodology that integrates an efficient, stateless low-power wireless communication protocol with a novel DMPC algorithm that provably avoids UAV collisions even under message loss. By utilizing event-triggered and distributed off-board computing, DMPC-SWARM supports nano UAVs, allowing them to benefit from additional computational resources while retaining scalability and fault tolerance. In a detailed theoretical analysis, we prove that DMPC-SWARM guarantees collision avoidance under realistic conditions, including communication delays and message loss. Finally, we present DMPC-SWARM's implementation on a swarm of up to 16 nano-quadcopters, demonstrating the first realization of these DMPC variants with computation distributed on multiple physical devices interconnected by a real wireless mesh networks. A video showcasing DMPC-SWARM is available at this http URL.

Title: Minimizing AoI in Mobile Edge Computing: Nested Index Policy with Preemptive and Non-preemptive Structure
Authors: Ning Yang, Yibo Liu, Shuo Chen, Meng Zhang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Mobile Edge Computing (MEC) leverages computational heterogeneity between mobile devices and edge nodes to enable real-time applications requiring high information freshness. The Age-of-Information (AoI) metric serves as a crucial evaluator of information timeliness in such systems. Addressing AoI minimization in multi-user MEC environments presents significant challenges due to stochastic computing times. In this paper, we consider multiple users offloading tasks to heterogeneous edge servers in an MEC system, focusing on preemptive and non-preemptive task scheduling mechanisms. The problem is first reformulated as a Restless Multi-Arm Bandit (RMAB) problem, with a multi-layer Markov Decision Process (MDP) framework established to characterize AoI dynamics in the MEC system. Based on the multi-layer MDP, we propose a nested index framework and design a nested index policy with provably asymptotic optimality. This establishes a theoretical framework adaptable to various scheduling mechanisms, achieving efficient optimization through state stratification and index design in both preemptive and non-preemptive modes. Finally, the closed-form of the nested index is derived, facilitating performance trade-offs between computational complexity and accuracy while ensuring the universal applicability of the nested index policy across both scheduling modes. The experimental results show that in non-preemptive scheduling, compared with the benchmark method, the optimality gap is reduced by 25.43%, while in preemptive scheduling, the gap has reduced by 61.84%. As the system scale increases, it asymptotically converges in two scheduling modes and especially provides near-optimal performance in non-preemptive structure.

Title: GENRE-CMR: Generalizable Deep Learning for Diverse Multi-Domain Cardiac MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Kian Anvari Hamedani, Narges Razizadeh, Shahabedin Nabavi, Mohsen Ebrahimi Moghaddam
Abstract: Accelerated Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance (CMR) image reconstruction remains a critical challenge due to the trade-off between scan time and image quality, particularly when generalizing across diverse acquisition settings. We propose GENRE-CMR, a generative adversarial network (GAN)-based architecture employing a residual deep unrolled reconstruction framework to enhance reconstruction fidelity and generalization. The architecture unrolls iterative optimization into a cascade of convolutional subnetworks, enriched with residual connections to enable progressive feature propagation from shallow to deeper stages. To further improve performance, we integrate two loss functions: (1) an Edge-Aware Region (EAR) loss, which guides the network to focus on structurally informative regions and helps prevent common reconstruction blurriness; and (2) a Statistical Distribution Alignment (SDA) loss, which regularizes the feature space across diverse data distributions via a symmetric KL divergence formulation. Extensive experiments confirm that GENRE-CMR surpasses state-of-the-art methods on training and unseen data, achieving 0.9552 SSIM and 38.90 dB PSNR on unseen distributions across various acceleration factors and sampling trajectories. Ablation studies confirm the contribution of each proposed component to reconstruction quality and generalization. Our framework presents a unified and robust solution for high-quality CMR reconstruction, paving the way for clinically adaptable deployment across heterogeneous acquisition protocols.

Title: Removing motion artifacts from mechanomyographic signals: an innovative filtering method applied to human movement analysis
Authors: Matthieu Correa (CIAMS), Nicolas Vignais (UR2, M2S, ComBO), Isabelle A. Siegler (CIAMS), Maxime Projetti
Abstract: Mechanomyography (MMG) is a promising tool for measuring muscle activity in the field but its sensitivity to motion artifacts limits its application. In this study, we proposed an adaptative filtering method for MMG accelerometers based on the complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition, with adaptative noise and spectral fuzzy entropy, to isolate motions artefacts from the MMG signal in dynamic conditions. We compared our method with the traditional band-pass filtering technique, demonstrating better results concerning motion recomposition for deltoid and erector spinae muscles (R${}^2$ = 0.907 and 0.842). Thus, this innovative method allows the filtering of motion artifacts dynamically in the 5-20 Hz bandwidth, which is not achievable with traditional method. However, the interpretation of accelerometric MMG signals from the trunk and lower-limb muscles during walking or running should be approached with great caution as impact-related accelerations are still present, though their exact quantity still needs to be quantified.

Title: A Proposal for Yield Improvement with Power Tradeoffs in CMOS LNAs (English Version)
Authors: J. L. González, J. C. Cruz, R. L. Moreno, D. Vázquez
Abstract: This paper studies an architecture with digitally controllable gain and power consumption to mitigate the impact of process variations on CMOS low-noise amplifiers (LNAs). A \SI{130}{nm}, \SI{1.2}{V} LNA implementing the proposed architecture is designed based on an analysis of variability in traditional LNAs under different bias currents and on the corresponding effects on the performance of a complete receiver. Two different adjustment strategies are evaluated, both of which are compatible with previously reported built-in self-test (BIST) circuits. Results show that the proposed architecture enables yield enhancement while keeping low-power operation compared with traditional LNAs.

Title: CodecBench: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Acoustic and Semantic Evaluation
Authors: Ruifan Deng, Yitian Gong, Qinghui Gao, Luozhijie Jin, Qinyuan Cheng, Zhaoye Fei, Shimin Li, Xipeng Qiu
Abstract: With the rise of multimodal large language models (LLMs), audio codec plays an increasingly vital role in encoding audio into discrete tokens, enabling integration of audio into text-based LLMs. Current audio codec captures two types of information: acoustic and semantic. As audio codec is applied to diverse scenarios in speech language model , it needs to model increasingly complex information and adapt to varied contexts, such as scenarios with multiple speakers, background noise, or richer paralinguistic information. However, existing codec's own evaluation has been limited by simplistic metrics and scenarios, and existing benchmarks for audio codec are not designed for complex application scenarios, which limits the assessment performance on complex datasets for acoustic and semantic capabilities. We introduce CodecBench, a comprehensive evaluation dataset to assess audio codec performance from both acoustic and semantic perspectives across four data domains. Through this benchmark, we aim to identify current limitations, highlight future research directions, and foster advances in the development of audio codec. The codes are available at this https URL.

Title: Optimistic vs Pessimistic Uncertainty Model Unfalsification
Authors: Jannes Hühnerbein, Jad Wehbeh, Eric C. Kerrigan
Abstract: We present a novel, input-output data-driven approach to uncertainty model identification. As the true bounds and distributions of system uncertainties ultimately remain unknown, we depart from the goal of identifying the uncertainty model and instead look for minimal concrete statements that can be made based on an uncertain system model and available input-output data. We refer to this as unfalsifying an uncertainty model. Two different unfalsification approaches are taken. The optimistic approach determines the smallest uncertainties that could explain the given data, while the pessimistic approach finds the largest possible uncertainties suggested by the data. The pessimistic problem is revealed to be a semi-infinite program, which is solved using the local reduction algorithm. It is also shown that the optimistic and pessimistic approaches to uncertainty model unfalsification are mathematical duals. Finally, both approaches are tested using an uncertain linear model with data from a simulated nonlinear system.

Title: Sound event detection with audio-text models and heterogeneous temporal annotations
Authors: Manu Harju, Annamaria Mesaros
Abstract: Recent advances in generating synthetic captions based on audio and related metadata allow using the information contained in natural language as input for other audio tasks. In this paper, we propose a novel method to guide a sound event detection system with free-form text. We use machine-generated captions as complementary information to the strong labels for training, and evaluate the systems using different types of textual inputs. In addition, we study a scenario where only part of the training data has strong labels, and the rest of it only has temporally weak labels. Our findings show that synthetic captions improve the performance in both cases compared to the CRNN architecture typically used for sound event detection. On a dataset of 50 highly unbalanced classes, the PSDS-1 score increases from 0.223 to 0.277 when trained with strong labels, and from 0.166 to 0.218 when half of the training data has only weak labels.

Title: Multi-cluster distributed optimization in open multi-agent systems over directed graphs with acknowledgement messages
Authors: Evagoras Makridis, Gabriele Oliva, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: In this paper, we tackle the problem of distributed optimization over directed networks in open multi-agent systems (OMAS), where agents may dynamically join or leave, causing persistent changes in network topology and problem dimension. These disruptions not only pose significant challenges to maintaining convergence and stability in distributed optimization algorithms, but could also break the network topology into multiple clusters, each one associated with its own set of objective functions. To address this, we propose a novel Open Distributed Optimization Algorithm with Gradient Tracking (OPEN-GT), which employs: (a) a dynamic mechanism for detecting active out-neighbors through acknowledgement messages, and (b) a fully distributed max-consensus procedure to spread information regarding agent departures, in possibly unbalanced directed networks. We show that when all active agents execute OPEN-GT, the optimization process in each formed cluster remains consistent, while the agents converge to their cluster-wide optimal solution if there exists a time after which the network remains unchanged. Finally, we validate our approach in a simulated environment with dynamically changing agent populations, demonstrating its resilience to network variations and its ability to support distributed optimization under OMAS dynamics.

Title: Online incremental learning for audio classification using a pretrained audio model
Authors: Manjunath Mulimani, Annamaria Mesaros
Abstract: Incremental learning aims to learn new tasks sequentially without forgetting the previously learned ones. Most of the existing incremental learning methods for audio focus on training the model from scratch on the initial task, and the same model is used to learn upcoming incremental tasks. The model is trained for several iterations to adapt to each new task, using some specific approaches to reduce the forgetting of old tasks. In this work, we propose a method for using generalizable audio embeddings produced by a pre-trained model to develop an online incremental learner that solves sequential audio classification tasks over time. Specifically, we inject a layer with a nonlinear activation function between the pre-trained model's audio embeddings and the classifier; this layer expands the dimensionality of the embeddings and effectively captures the distinct characteristics of sound classes. Our method adapts the model in a single forward pass (online) through the training samples of any task, with minimal forgetting of old tasks. We demonstrate the performance of the proposed method in two incremental learning setups: one class-incremental learning using ESC-50 and one domain-incremental learning of different cities from the TAU Urban Acoustic Scenes 2019 dataset; for both cases, the proposed approach outperforms other methods.

Title: Weighted Bayesian Cram$\acute{\text{e}}$r-Rao Bound for Mixed-Resolution Parameter Estimation
Authors: Yaniv Mazor, Tirza Routtenberg
Abstract: Mixed-resolution architectures, combining high-resolution (analog) data with coarsely quantized (e.g., 1-bit) data, are widely employed in emerging communication and radar systems to reduce hardware costs and power consumption. However, the use of coarsely quantized data introduces non-trivial tradeoffs in parameter estimation tasks. In this paper, we investigate the derivation of lower bounds for such systems. In particular, we develop the weighted Bayesian Cramer-Rao bound (WBCRB) for the mixed-resolution setting with a general weight function. We demonstrate the special cases of: (i) the classical BCRB; (ii) the WBCRB that is based on the Bayesian Fisher information matrix (BFIM)-Inverse weighting; and (iii) the Aharon-Tabrikian tightest WBCRB with an optimal weight function. Based on the developed WBCRB, we propose a new method to approximate the mean-squared-error (MSE) by partitioning the estimation problem into two regions: (a) where the 1-bit quantized data is informative; and (b) where it is saturated. We apply region-specific WBCRB approximations in these regions to achieve an accurate composite MSE estimate. We derive the bounds and MSE approximation for the linear Gaussian orthonormal (LGO) model, which is commonly used in practical signal processing applications. Our simulation results demonstrate the use of the proposed bounds and approximation method in the LGO model with a scalar unknown parameter. It is shown that the WBCRB outperforms the BCRB, where the BFIM-Inverse weighting version approaches the optimal WBCRB. Moreover, it is shown that the WBCRB-based MSE approximation is tighter and accurately predicts the non-monotonic behavior of the MSE in the presence of quantization errors.

Title: A Solution of Ultra Wideband Based High-resolution and Lossless Audio Transmission
Authors: Fengyun Zhang
Abstract: This paper provides an overview of the current challenges in wireless audio transmission and highlights the limitations of existing technologies regarding data bandwidth, data compression, latency, and inter-device compatibility. To address these shortcomings, it proposes a high-resolution, lossless audio transmission scheme utilizing ultra wideband (UWB) technology. UWB emerges as a promising solution by offering the necessary bandwidth to enable exceptional sound quality with ultra-low latency, making it ideal for real-time audio applications and addressing synchronization concerns in audio-visual use cases. Additionally, UWB's unique capabilities extend beyond high-resolution audio, allowing for precise location tracking in augmented and virtual reality applications.

Title: Leveraging Discriminative Latent Representations for Conditioning GAN-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Shrishti Saha Shetu, Emanuël A. P. Habets, Andreas Brendel
Abstract: Generative speech enhancement methods based on generative adversarial networks (GANs) and diffusion models have shown promising results in various speech enhancement tasks. However, their performance in very low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) scenarios remains under-explored and limited, as these conditions pose significant challenges to both discriminative and generative state-of-the-art methods. To address this, we propose a method that leverages latent features extracted from discriminative speech enhancement models as generic conditioning features to improve GAN-based speech enhancement. The proposed method, referred to as DisCoGAN, demonstrates performance improvements over baseline models, particularly in low-SNR scenarios, while also maintaining competitive or superior performance in high-SNR conditions and on real-world recordings. We also conduct a comprehensive evaluation of conventional GAN-based architectures, including GANs trained end-to-end, GANs as a first processing stage, and post-filtering GANs, as well as discriminative models under low-SNR conditions. We show that DisCoGAN consistently outperforms existing methods. Finally, we present an ablation study that investigates the contributions of individual components within DisCoGAN and analyzes the impact of the discriminative conditioning method on overall performance.

Title: Breaking Barriers in Health Monitoring: Multi-Scenario Vital Sign Detection Using Mm-Wave MIMO FMCW Radar
Authors: Ehsan Sadeghi, Paul Havinga
Abstract: This paper explores the deployment of mm-wave Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radar for vital sign detection across multiple scenarios. We focus on overcoming the limitations of traditional sensing methods by enhancing signal processing techniques to capture subtle physiological changes effectively. Our study introduces novel adaptations of the Prony and MUSIC algorithms tailored for real-time heart and respiration rate monitoring, significantly advancing the accuracy and reliability of non-contact vital sign monitoring using radar technologies. Notably, these algorithms demonstrate a robust ability to suppress noise and harmonic interference. For instance, the mean absolute errors (MAE) for MUSIC and Prony in heart rate detection are 1.8 and 0.81, respectively, while for respiration rate, the MAEs are 1.01 and 0.8, respectively. These results underscore the potential of FMCW radar as a reliable, non-invasive solution for continuous vital sign monitoring in healthcare settings, particularly in clinical and emergency scenarios where traditional contact-based monitoring is impractical.

Title: Automatic Inspection Based on Switch Sounds of Electric Point Machines
Authors: Ayano Shibata, Toshiki Gunji, Mitsuaki Tsuda, Takashi Endo, Kota Dohi, Tomoya Nishida, Satoko Nomoto
Abstract: Since 2018, East Japan Railway Company and Hitachi, Ltd. have been working to replace human inspections with IoT-based monitoring. The purpose is Labor-saving required for equipment inspections and provide appropriate preventive maintenance. As an alternative to visual inspection, it has been difficult to substitute electrical characteristic monitoring, and the introduction of new high-performance sensors has been costly. In 2019, we implemented cameras and microphones in an ``NS'' electric point machines to reduce downtime from equipment failures, allowing for remote monitoring of lock-piece conditions. This method for detecting turnout switching errors based on sound information was proposed, and the expected test results were obtained. The proposed method will make it possible to detect equipment failures in real time, thereby reducing the need for visual inspections. This paper presents the results of our technical studies aimed at automating the inspection of electronic point machines using sound, specifically focusing on ``switch sound'' beginning in 2019.

Title: AERO-LQG: Aerial-Enabled Robust Optimization for LQG-Based Quadrotor Flight Controller
Authors: Daniel Engelsman, Itzik Klein
Abstract: Quadrotors are indispensable in civilian, industrial, and military domains, undertaking complex, high-precision tasks once reserved for specialized systems. Across all contexts, energy efficiency remains a critical constraint: quadrotors must reconcile the high power demands of agility with the minimal consumption required for extended endurance. Meeting this trade-off calls for mode-specific optimization frameworks that adapt to diverse mission profiles. At their core lie optimal control policies defining error functions whose minimization yields robust, mission-tailored performance. While solutions are straightforward for fixed weight matrices, selecting those weights is a far greater challenge-lacking analytical guidance and thus relying on exhaustive or stochastic search. This interdependence can be framed as a bi-level optimization problem, with the outer loop determining weights a priori. This work introduces an aerial-enabled robust optimization for LQG tuning (AERO-LQG), a framework employing evolutionary strategy to fine-tune LQG weighting parameters. Applied to the linearized hovering mode of quadrotor flight, AERO-LQG achieves performance gains of several tens of percent, underscoring its potential for enabling high-performance, energy-efficient quadrotor control. The project is available at GitHub.

Title: Missing Money and Market-Based Adequacy in Deeply Decarbonized Power Systems with Long-Duration Energy Storage
Authors: Adam Suski, Elina Spyrou, Richard Green
Abstract: The ability of deeply decarbonised power systems to ensure adequacy may increasingly depend on long-duration energy storage (LDES). A central challenge is whether capacity markets (CMs), originally designed around thermal generation, can provide efficient investment signals when storage becomes a central participant. While recent studies have advanced methods for accrediting variable renewables and short-duration storage, the effectiveness of these methods in CMs with substantial LDES penetration remains largely unexplored. To address this gap, we extend a two-stage stochastic equilibrium investment model by endogenising continuous, duration-based capacity accreditation for storage and apply it to a Great Britain-based case using 40 years of weather-driven demand and renewable profiles under varying emission limits. Results show that well-calibrated CMs can sustain near-efficient investment and mitigate revenue volatility, but their effectiveness diminishes in deeply decarbonized systems, underscoring both their potential and the regulatory challenges of supporting large-scale LDES.

Title: Multilingual Dataset Integration Strategies for Robust Audio Deepfake Detection: A SAFE Challenge System
Authors: Hashim Ali, Surya Subramani, Lekha Bollinani, Nithin Sai Adupa, Sali El-Loh, Hafiz Malik
Abstract: The SAFE Challenge evaluates synthetic speech detection across three tasks: unmodified audio, processed audio with compression artifacts, and laundered audio designed to evade detection. We systematically explore self-supervised learning (SSL) front-ends, training data compositions, and audio length configurations for robust deepfake detection. Our AASIST-based approach incorporates WavLM large frontend with RawBoost augmentation, trained on a multilingual dataset of 256,600 samples spanning 9 languages and over 70 TTS systems from CodecFake, MLAAD v5, SpoofCeleb, Famous Figures, and MAILABS. Through extensive experimentation with different SSL front-ends, three training data versions, and two audio lengths, we achieved second place in both Task 1 (unmodified audio detection) and Task 3 (laundered audio detection), demonstrating strong generalization and robustness.

Title: A Correction for the Paper "Symplectic geometry mode decomposition and its application to rotating machinery compound fault diagnosis"
Authors: Hong-Yan Zhang, Haoting Liu, Rui-Jia Lin, Yu Zhou
Abstract: The symplectic geometry mode decomposition (SGMD) is a powerful method for decomposing time series, which is based on the diagonal averaging principle (DAP) inherited from the singular spectrum analysis (SSA). Although the authors of SGMD method generalized the form of the trajectory matrix in SSA, the DAP is not updated simultaneously. In this work, we pointed out the limitations of the SGMD method and fixed the bugs with the pulling back theorem for computing the given component of time series from the corresponding component of trajectory matrix.

Title: Efficient Fine-Tuning of DINOv3 Pretrained on Natural Images for Atypical Mitotic Figure Classification in MIDOG 2025
Authors: Guillaume Balezo, Raphaël Bourgade, Thomas Walter
Abstract: Atypical mitotic figures (AMFs) are markers of abnormal cell division associated with poor prognosis, yet their detection remains difficult due to low prevalence, subtle morphology, and inter-observer variability. The MIDOG 2025 challenge introduces a benchmark for AMF classification across multiple domains. In this work, we evaluate the recently published DINOv3-H+ vision transformer, pretrained on natural images, which we fine-tuned using low-rank adaptation (LoRA, 650k trainable parameters) and extensive augmentation. Despite the domain gap, DINOv3 transfers effectively to histopathology, achieving a balanced accuracy of 0.8871 on the preliminary test set. These results highlight the robustness of DINOv3 pretraining and show that, when combined with parameter-efficient fine-tuning, it provides a strong baseline for atypical mitosis classification in MIDOG 2025.

Title: Task-Aware Tuning of Time Constants in Spiking Neural Networks for Multimodal Classification
Authors: Chiu-Chang Cheng, Kapil Bhardwaj, Ya-Ning Chang, Sayani Majumdar, Chao-Hung Wang
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are promising candidates for low-power edge computing in domains such as wearable sensing and time-series analysis. A key neuronal parameter, the leaky time constant (LTC), governs temporal integration of information in Leaky Integrateand-Fire (LIF) neurons, yet its impact on feedforward SNN performance across different data modalities remains underexplored. This study investigates the role of LTC in a temporally adaptive feedforward SNN applied to static image, dynamic image, and biosignal time-series classification. Presented experiments demonstrate that LTCs critically affect inference accuracy, synaptic weight distributions, and firing dynamics. For static and dynamic images, intermediate LTCs yield higher accuracy and compact, centered weight histograms, reflecting stable feature encoding. In time-series tasks, optimal LTCs enhance temporal feature retention and result in broader weight sparsity, allowing for tolerance of LTC variations. The provided results show that inference accuracy peaks at specific LTC ranges, with significant degradation beyond this optimal band due to over-integration or excessive forgetting. Firing rate analysis reveals a strong interplay between LTC, network depth, and energy efficiency, underscoring the importance of balanced spiking activity. These findings reveal that task-specific LTC tuning is essential for efficient spike coding and robust learning. The results provide practical guidelines for hardware-aware SNN optimization and highlight how neuronal time constants can be designed to match task dynamics. This work contributes toward scalable, ultra-lowpower SNN deployment for real-time classification tasks in neuromorphic computing.

Abstract: Monte Carlo Tree Search is a popular method for solving decision making problems. Faster implementations allow for more simulations within the same wall clock time, directly improving search performance. To this end, we present an alternative array-based implementation of the classic Upper Confidence bounds applied to Trees algorithm. Our method preserves the logic of the original algorithm, but eliminates the need for branch prediction, enabling faster performance on pipelined processors, and up to a factor of 2.8 times better scaling with search depth in our numerical simulations.

Title: Enhancing Automatic Modulation Recognition With a Reconstruction-Driven Vision Transformer Under Limited Labels
Authors: Hossein Ahmadi, Banafsheh Saffari
Abstract: Automatic modulation recognition (AMR) is critical for cognitive radio, spectrum monitoring, and secure wireless communication. However, existing solutions often rely on large labeled datasets or multi-stage training pipelines, which limit scalability and generalization in practice. We propose a unified Vision Transformer (ViT) framework that integrates supervised, self-supervised, and reconstruction objectives. The model combines a ViT encoder, a lightweight convolutional decoder, and a linear classifier; the reconstruction branch maps augmented signals back to their originals, anchoring the encoder to fine-grained I/Q structure. This strategy promotes robust, discriminative feature learning during pretraining, while partial label supervision in fine-tuning enables effective classification with limited labels. On the RML2018.01A dataset, our approach outperforms supervised CNN and ViT baselines in low-label regimes, approaches ResNet-level accuracy with only 15-20% labeled data, and maintains strong performance across varying SNR levels. Overall, the framework provides a simple, generalizable, and label-efficient solution for AMR.

Title: Characterization of Safety in Stochastic Difference Inclusions using Barrier Functions
Authors: Masoumeh Ghanbarpour, Sriram Sankaranarayanan
Abstract: We study stochastic systems characterized by difference inclusions. Such stochastic differential inclusions are defined by set-valued maps involving the current state and stochastic input. For such systems, we investigate the problem of proving bounds on the worst-case probability of violating safety properties. Our approach uses the well-known concept of barrier functions from the study of stochastic control systems. However, barrier functions are hard to prove in the presence of stochastic inputs and adversarial choices due to the set-valued nature of the dynamics. In this paper, we show that under some assumptions on the set-valued map including upper semi-continuity and convexity combined with a concave barrier function vastly simplifies the proof of barrier conditions, allowing us to effectively substitute each random input in terms of its expectation. We prove key results based on the theory of set-valued maps and provide some interesting numerical examples. The ideas proposed here will contribute to the growing interest in problems of robust control and verification of stochastic systems in the presence of uncertain distributions and unmodeled dynamics.

Title: What can we learn from signals and systems in a transformer? Insights for probabilistic modeling and inference architecture
Authors: Heng-Sheng Chang, Prashant G. Mehta
Abstract: In the 1940s, Wiener introduced a linear predictor, where the future prediction is computed by linearly combining the past data. A transformer generalizes this idea: it is a nonlinear predictor where the next-token prediction is computed by nonlinearly combining the past tokens. In this essay, we present a probabilistic model that interprets transformer signals as surrogates of conditional measures, and layer operations as fixed-point updates. An explicit form of the fixed-point update is described for the special case when the probabilistic model is a hidden Markov model (HMM). In part, this paper is in an attempt to bridge the classical nonlinear filtering theory with modern inference architectures.

Title: Testing and Fault Tolerance Techniques for Carbon Nanotube-Based FPGAs
Authors: Siyuan Lu, Kangwei Xu, Peng Xie, Rui Wang, Yuanqing Cheng
Abstract: As the semiconductor manufacturing process technology node shrinks into the nanometer-scale, the CMOS-based Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) face big challenges in scalability of performance and power consumption. Multi-walled Carbon Nanotube (MWCNT) serves as a promising candidate for Cu interconnects thanks to the superior conductivity. Moreover, Carbon Nanotube Field Transistor (CNFET) also emerges as a prospective alternative to the conventional CMOS device because of high power efficiency and large noise margin. The combination of MWCNT and CNFET enables the promising CNT-based FPGAs. However, the MWCNT interconnects exhibit significant process variations due to immature fabrication process, leading to delay faults. Also, the non-ideal CNFET fabrication process may generate a few metallic CNTs (m-CNTs), rendering correlated faulty blocks. In this article, we propose a ring oscillator (RO) based testing technique to detect delay faults due to the process variation of MWCNT interconnects. Furthermore, we propose an effective testing technique for the carry chains in CLBs, and an improved circuit design based on the lookup table (LUT) is applied to speed up the fault testing of CNT-based FPGAs. In addition, we propose a testing algorithm to detect m-CNTs in CLBs. Finally, we propose a redundant spare row sharing architecture to improve the yield of CNT-based FPGA further. Experimental results show that the test time for a 6-input LUT can be reduced by 35.49% compared with conventional testing, and the proposed algorithm can achieve a high test coverage with little overhead. The proposed redundant architecture can repair the faulty segment effectively and efficiently.

Title: Adaptive Segmentation of EEG for Machine Learning Applications
Authors: Johnson Zhou, Joseph West, Krista A. Ehinger, Zhenming Ren, Sam E. John, David B. Grayden
Abstract: Objective. Electroencephalography (EEG) data is derived by sampling continuous neurological time series signals. In order to prepare EEG signals for machine learning, the signal must be divided into manageable segments. The current naive approach uses arbitrary fixed time slices, which may have limited biological relevance because brain states are not confined to fixed intervals. We investigate whether adaptive segmentation methods are beneficial for machine learning EEG analysis. Approach. We introduce a novel adaptive segmentation method, CTXSEG, that creates variable-length segments based on statistical differences in the EEG data and propose ways to use them with modern machine learning approaches that typically require fixed-length input. We assess CTXSEG using controllable synthetic data generated by our novel signal generator CTXGEN. While our CTXSEG method has general utility, we validate it on a real-world use case by applying it to an EEG seizure detection problem. We compare the performance of CTXSEG with fixed-length segmentation in the preprocessing step of a typical EEG machine learning pipeline for seizure detection. Main results. We found that using CTXSEG to prepare EEG data improves seizure detection performance compared to fixed-length approaches when evaluated using a standardized framework, without modifying the machine learning method, and requires fewer segments. Significance. This work demonstrates that adaptive segmentation with CTXSEG can be readily applied to modern machine learning approaches, with potential to improve performance. It is a promising alternative to fixed-length segmentation for signal preprocessing and should be considered as part of the standard preprocessing repertoire in EEG machine learning applications.

Title: Understanding Incremental Learning with Closed-form Solution to Gradient Flow on Overparamerterized Matrix Factorization
Authors: Hancheng Min, René Vidal
Abstract: Many theoretical studies on neural networks attribute their excellent empirical performance to the implicit bias or regularization induced by first-order optimization algorithms when training networks under certain initialization assumptions. One example is the incremental learning phenomenon in gradient flow (GF) on an overparamerterized matrix factorization problem with small initialization: GF learns a target matrix by sequentially learning its singular values in decreasing order of magnitude over time. In this paper, we develop a quantitative understanding of this incremental learning behavior for GF on the symmetric matrix factorization problem, using its closed-form solution obtained by solving a Riccati-like matrix differential equation. We show that incremental learning emerges from some time-scale separation among dynamics corresponding to learning different components in the target matrix. By decreasing the initialization scale, these time-scale separations become more prominent, allowing one to find low-rank approximations of the target matrix. Lastly, we discuss the possible avenues for extending this analysis to asymmetric matrix factorization problems.

Authors: Antonio Victor Machado de Oliveira, Debjit Sarkar, Ali Hajimiri
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography with fully integrated microfluidics and electronics is presented for the first time in a CMOS chip. Chambers and electrodes are fabricated in the interconnect layers of a 65 nm CMOS chip through post-processing, enabling picoliter-volumes to be processed and imaged. Tomography maps are reconstructed by reading out voltages from a 16-element electrode array and processing the data off-chip, and sources of variation in reconstruction are discussed. The EIT system presented in this work serves as a proof-of-concept towards using CMOS as a platform for co-integrated microfluidics and electronics.

Title: Learning Fast, Tool aware Collision Avoidance for Collaborative Robots
Authors: Joonho Lee, Yunho Kim, Seokjoon Kim, Quan Nguyen, Youngjin Heo
Abstract: Ensuring safe and efficient operation of collaborative robots in human environments is challenging, especially in dynamic settings where both obstacle motion and tasks change over time. Current robot controllers typically assume full visibility and fixed tools, which can lead to collisions or overly conservative behavior. In our work, we introduce a tool-aware collision avoidance system that adjusts in real time to different tool sizes and modes of tool-environment interaction. Using a learned perception model, our system filters out robot and tool components from the point cloud, reasons about occluded area, and predicts collision under partial observability. We then use a control policy trained via constrained reinforcement learning to produce smooth avoidance maneuvers in under 10 milliseconds. In simulated and real-world tests, our approach outperforms traditional approaches (APF, MPPI) in dynamic environments, while maintaining sub-millimeter accuracy. Moreover, our system operates with approximately 60% lower computational cost compared to a state-of-the-art GPU-based planner. Our approach provides modular, efficient, and effective collision avoidance for robots operating in dynamic environments. We integrate our method into a collaborative robot application and demonstrate its practical use for safe and responsive operation.

Title: Towards Inclusive Communication: A Unified LLM-Based Framework for Sign Language, Lip Movements, and Audio Understanding
Authors: Jeong Hun Yeo, Hyeongseop Rha, Sungjune Park, Junil Won, Yong Man Ro
Abstract: Audio is the primary modality for human communication and has driven the success of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) technologies. However, such systems remain inherently inaccessible to individuals who are deaf or hard of hearing. Visual alternatives such as sign language and lip reading offer effective substitutes, and recent advances in Sign Language Translation (SLT) and Visual Speech Recognition (VSR) have improved audio-less communication. Yet, these modalities have largely been studied in isolation, and their integration within a unified framework remains underexplored. In this paper, we introduce the first unified framework capable of handling diverse combinations of sign language, lip movements, and audio for spoken-language text generation. We focus on three main objectives: (i) designing a unified, modality-agnostic architecture capable of effectively processing heterogeneous inputs; (ii) exploring the underexamined synergy among modalities, particularly the role of lip movements as non-manual cues in sign language comprehension; and (iii) achieving performance on par with or superior to state-of-the-art models specialized for individual tasks. Building on this framework, we achieve performance on par with or better than task-specific state-of-the-art models across SLT, VSR, ASR, and AVSR. Furthermore, our analysis reveals that explicitly modeling lip movements as a separate modality significantly improves SLT performance.

Title: Physics-Constrained Machine Learning for Chemical Engineering
Authors: Angan Mukherjee, Victor M. Zavala (Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, University of Wisconsin-Madison, Madison, USA)
Abstract: Physics-constrained machine learning (PCML) combines physical models with data-driven approaches to improve reliability, generalizability, and interpretability. Although PCML has shown significant benefits in diverse scientific and engineering domains, technical and intellectual challenges hinder its applicability in complex chemical engineering applications. Key difficulties include determining the amount and type of physical knowledge to embed, designing effective fusion strategies with ML, scaling models to large datasets and simulators, and quantifying predictive uncertainty. This perspective summarizes recent developments and highlights challenges/opportunities in applying PCML to chemical engineering, emphasizing on closed-loop experimental design, real-time dynamics and control, and handling of multi-scale phenomena.

Title: Bridging Finite and Infinite-Horizon Nash Equilibria in Linear Quadratic Games
Authors: Giulio Salizzoni, Sophie Hall, Maryam Kamgarpour
Abstract: Finite-horizon linear quadratic (LQ) games admit a unique Nash equilibrium, while infinite-horizon settings may have multiple. We clarify the relationship between these two cases by interpreting the finite-horizon equilibrium as a nonlinear dynamical system. Within this framework, we prove that its fixed points are exactly the infinite-horizon equilibria and that any such equilibrium can be recovered by an appropriate choice of terminal costs. We further show that periodic orbits of the dynamical system, when they arise, correspond to periodic Nash equilibria, and we provide numerical evidence of convergence to such cycles. Finally, simulations reveal three asymptotic regimes: convergence to stationary equilibria, convergence to periodic equilibria, and bounded non-convergent trajectories. These findings offer new insights and tools for tuning finite-horizon LQ games using infinite-horizon.

Title: Achieving Optimal Performance-Cost Trade-Off in Hierarchical Cell-Free Massive MIMO
Authors: Wei Jiang, Hans D Schotten
Abstract: Cell-free (CF) massive MIMO offers uniform service via distributed access points (APs), which impose high deployment costs. A novel design called hierarchical cell-free (HCF) addresses this problem by replacing some APs with a central base station, thereby lowering the costs of fronthaul network (wireless sites and fiber cables) while preserving performance. To identify the optimal uplink configuration in HCF massive MIMO, this paper provides the first comprehensive analysis, benchmarking it against cellular and CF systems. We develop a unified analytical framework for spectral efficiency that supports arbitrary combining schemes and introduce a novel hierarchical combining approach tailored to HCF two-tier architecture. Through analysis and evaluation of user fairness, system capacity, fronthaul requirements, and computational complexity, this paper identifies that HCF using centralized zero-forcing combining achieves the optimal balance between performance and cost-efficiency.

Title: What is the Most Efficient Technique for Uplink Cell-Free Massive MIMO?
Authors: Wei Jiang, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: This paper seeks to determine the most efficient uplink technique for cell-free massive MIMO systems. Despite offering great advances, existing works suffer from fragmented methodologies and inconsistent assumptions (e.g., single- vs. multi-antenna access points, ideal vs. spatially correlated channels). To address these limitations, we: (1) establish a unified analytical framework compatible with centralized/distributed processing and diverse combining schemes; (2) develop a universal optimization strategy for max-min power control; and (3) conduct a holistic study among four critical metrics: worst-case user spectral efficiency (fairness), system capacity, fronthaul signaling, and computational complexity. Through analyses and evaluation, this work ultimately identifies the optimal uplink technique for practical cell-free deployments.

Title: Balancing Profit and Traveller Acceptance in Ride-Pooling Personalised Fares
Authors: Michal Bujak, Rafal Kucharski
Abstract: Ride-pooling systems, to succeed, must provide an attractive service, namely compensate perceived costs with an appealing price. However, because of a strong heterogeneity in a value-of-time, each traveller has his own acceptable price, unknown to the operator. Here, we show that individual acceptance levels can be learned by the operator (over $90\%$ accuracy for pooled travellers in $10$ days) to optimise personalised fares. We propose an adaptive pricing policy, where every day the operator constructs an offer that progressively meets travellers' expectations and attracts a growing demand. Our results suggest that operators, by learning behavioural traits of individual travellers, may improve performance not only for travellers (increased utility) but also for themselves (increased profit). Moreover, such knowledge allows the operator to remove inefficient pooled rides and focus on attractive and profitable combinations.

Title: Non-expert to Expert Motion Translation Using Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Yuki Tanaka, Seiichiro Katsura
Abstract: Decreasing skilled workers is a very serious problem in the world. To deal with this problem, the skill transfer from experts to robots has been researched. These methods which teach robots by human motion are called imitation learning. Experts' skills generally appear in not only position data, but also force data. Thus, position and force data need to be saved and reproduced. To realize this, a lot of research has been conducted in the framework of a motion-copying system. Recent research uses machine learning methods to generate motion commands. However, most of them could not change tasks by following human intention. Some of them can change tasks by conditional training, but the labels are limited. Thus, we propose the flexible motion translation method by using Generative Adversarial Networks. The proposed method enables users to teach robots tasks by inputting data, and skills by a trained model. We evaluated the proposed system with a 3-DOF calligraphy robot.

Title: An Efficient Data-Driven Framework for Linear Quadratic Output Feedback Control
Authors: Jun Xie, Yuan-hua Ni, Yiqin Yang, Feng Duan, Bo Xu
Abstract: Linear quadratic regulator with unmeasurable states and unknown system matrix parameters better aligns with practical scenarios. However, for this problem, balancing the optimality of the resulting controller and the leniency of the algorithm's feasibility conditions remains a non-trivial challenge, as no well-established general method has yet been developed to address this trade-off. To address this gap, this study first develops a comprehensive theoretical framework for state parameterization that equivalently substitutes for unknown states. By analyzing the controllability of consistent systems satisfied by substitute states, this framework quantifies the capability of substitute state data matrices to parameterize unknown closed-loop systems and output feedback controllers, thereby constructing a modified state parameterization form that meets the complete data parameterization condition of Willems' Fundamental Lemma. Leveraging this framework, this study proposes efficient model-free off-policy policy iteration and value iteration algorithms with theoretical guarantees to solve for the optimal output feedback controller. Compared with existing studies, particularly for multi-output problems where existing model-free reinforcement learning algorithms may fail, the proposed method removes redundant information in substitute states and the additional full row rank condition on regression matrices, thereby ensuring the solution of optimal output feedback controllers equivalent to optimal state feedback controllers for multi-output systems. Furthermore, this study pioneers a comprehensive and highly scalable theoretical analysis of state parameterization from a data-driven viewpoint, and the proposed algorithms exhibit significant advantages in implementation conditions, data demand, unknown handling, and convergence speed.

Title: The Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF): A Bounded Possibilistic Framework for Ordinal State Estimation
Authors: Moriba Jah, Van Haslett
Abstract: Traditional state estimation methods rely on probabilistic assumptions that often collapse epistemic uncertainty into scalar beliefs, risking overconfidence in sparse or adversarial sensing environments. We introduce the Epistemic Support-Point Filter (ESPF), a novel non-Bayesian filtering framework fully grounded in possibility theory and epistemic humility. ESPF redefines the evolution of belief over state space using compatibility-weighted support updates, surprisalaware pruning, and adaptive dispersion via sparse grid quadrature. Unlike conventional filters, ESPF does not seek a posterior distribution, but rather maintains a structured region of plausibility or non-rejection, updated using ordinal logic rather than integration. For multi-model inference, we employ the Choquet integral to fuse competing hypotheses based on a dynamic epistemic capacity function, generalizing classical winner-take-all strategies. The result is an inference engine capable of dynamically contracting or expanding belief support in direct response to information structure, without requiring prior statistical calibration. This work presents a foundational shift in how inference, evidence, and ignorance are reconciled, supporting robust estimation where priors are unavailable, misleading, or epistemically unjustified.

Title: OLMoASR: Open Models and Data for Training Robust Speech Recognition Models
Authors: Huong Ngo, Matt Deitke, Martijn Bartelds, Sarah Pratt, Josh Gardner, Matt Jordan, Ludwig Schmidt
Abstract: Improvements in training data scale and quality have led to significant advances, yet its influence in speech recognition remains underexplored. In this paper, we present a large-scale dataset, OLMoASR-Pool, and series of models, OLMoASR, to study and develop robust zero-shot speech recognition models. Beginning from OLMoASR-Pool, a collection of 3M hours of English audio and 17M transcripts, we design text heuristic filters to remove low-quality or mistranscribed data. Our curation pipeline produces a new dataset containing 1M hours of high-quality audio-transcript pairs, which we call OLMoASR-Mix. We use OLMoASR-Mix to train the OLMoASR-Mix suite of models, ranging from 39M (this http URL) to 1.5B (this http URL) parameters. Across all model scales, OLMoASR achieves comparable average performance to OpenAI's Whisper on short and long-form speech recognition benchmarks. Notably, this http URL attains a 12.8\% and 11.0\% word error rate (WER) that is on par with Whisper's largest English-only model this http URL's 12.4\% and 10.5\% WER for short and long-form recognition respectively (at equivalent parameter count). OLMoASR-Pool, OLMoASR models, and filtering, training and evaluation code will be made publicly available to further research on robust speech processing.

Title: Dino U-Net: Exploiting High-Fidelity Dense Features from Foundation Models for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Yifan Gao, Haoyue Li, Feng Yuan, Xiaosong Wang, Xin Gao
Abstract: Foundation models pre-trained on large-scale natural image datasets offer a powerful paradigm for medical image segmentation. However, effectively transferring their learned representations for precise clinical applications remains a challenge. In this work, we propose Dino U-Net, a novel encoder-decoder architecture designed to exploit the high-fidelity dense features of the DINOv3 vision foundation model. Our architecture introduces an encoder built upon a frozen DINOv3 backbone, which employs a specialized adapter to fuse the model's rich semantic features with low-level spatial details. To preserve the quality of these representations during dimensionality reduction, we design a new fidelity-aware projection module (FAPM) that effectively refines and projects the features for the decoder. We conducted extensive experiments on seven diverse public medical image segmentation datasets. Our results show that Dino U-Net achieves state-of-the-art performance, consistently outperforming previous methods across various imaging modalities. Our framework proves to be highly scalable, with segmentation accuracy consistently improving as the backbone model size increases up to the 7-billion-parameter variant. The findings demonstrate that leveraging the superior, dense-pretrained features from a general-purpose foundation model provides a highly effective and parameter-efficient approach to advance the accuracy of medical image segmentation.

Title: Learning Robust Spatial Representations from Binaural Audio through Feature Distillation
Authors: Holger Severin Bovbjerg (1), Jan Østergaard (1), Jesper Jensen (1, 2), Shinji Watanabe (3), Zheng-Hua Tan ((1) Aalborg University (2) Eriksholm Research Centre, (3) Carnegie Mellon University)
Abstract: Recently, deep representation learning has shown strong performance in multiple audio tasks. However, its use for learning spatial representations from multichannel audio is underexplored. We investigate the use of a pretraining stage based on feature distillation to learn a robust spatial representation of binaural speech without the need for data labels. In this framework, spatial features are computed from clean binaural speech samples to form prediction labels. These clean features are then predicted from corresponding augmented speech using a neural network. After pretraining, we throw away the spatial feature predictor and use the learned encoder weights to initialize a DoA estimation model which we fine-tune for DoA estimation. Our experiments demonstrate that the pretrained models show improved performance in noisy and reverberant environments after fine-tuning for direction-of-arrival estimation, when compared to fully supervised models and classic signal processing methods.

Title: Finite-Time Guarantees for Multi-Agent Combinatorial Bandits with Nonstationary Rewards
Authors: Katherine B. Adams, Justin J. Boutilier, Qinyang He, Yonatan Mintz
Abstract: We study a sequential resource allocation problem where a decision maker selects subsets of agents at each period to maximize overall outcomes without prior knowledge of individual-level effects. Our framework applies to settings such as community health interventions, targeted digital advertising, and workforce retention programs, where intervention effects evolve dynamically. Agents may exhibit habituation (diminished response from frequent selection) or recovery (enhanced response from infrequent selection). The technical challenge centers on nonstationary reward distributions that lead to changing intervention effects over time. The problem requires balancing two key competing objectives: heterogeneous individual rewards and the exploration-exploitation tradeoff in terms of learning for improved future decisions as opposed to maximizing immediate outcomes. Our contribution introduces the first framework incorporating this form of nonstationary rewards in the combinatorial multi-armed bandit literature. We develop algorithms with theoretical guarantees on dynamic regret and demonstrate practical efficacy through a diabetes intervention case study. Our personalized community intervention algorithm achieved up to three times as much improvement in program enrollment compared to baseline approaches, validating the framework's potential for real-world applications. This work bridges theoretical advances in adaptive learning with practical challenges in population-level behavioral change interventions.

Title: Scaling Fabric-Based Piezoresistive Sensor Arrays for Whole-Body Tactile Sensing
Authors: Curtis C. Johnson, Daniel Webb, David Hill, Marc D. Killpack
Abstract: Scaling tactile sensing for robust whole-body manipulation is a significant challenge, often limited by wiring complexity, data throughput, and system reliability. This paper presents a complete architecture designed to overcome these barriers. Our approach pairs open-source, fabric-based sensors with custom readout electronics that reduce signal crosstalk to less than 3.3% through hardware-based mitigation. Critically, we introduce a novel, daisy-chained SPI bus topology that avoids the practical limitations of common wireless protocols and the prohibitive wiring complexity of USB hub-based systems. This architecture streams synchronized data from over 8,000 taxels across 1 square meter of sensing area at update rates exceeding 50 FPS, confirming its suitability for real-time control. We validate the system's efficacy in a whole-body grasping task where, without feedback, the robot's open-loop trajectory results in an uncontrolled application of force that slowly crushes a deformable cardboard box. With real-time tactile feedback, the robot transforms this motion into a gentle, stable grasp, successfully manipulating the object without causing structural damage. This work provides a robust and well-characterized platform to enable future research in advanced whole-body control and physical human-robot interaction.

Title: WoW-Bench: Evaluating Fine-Grained Acoustic Perception in Audio-Language Models via Marine Mammal Vocalizations
Authors: Jaeyeon Kim, Heeseung Yun, Sang Hoon Woo, Chao-Han Huck Yang, Gunhee Kim
Abstract: Large audio language models (LALMs) extend language understanding into the auditory domain, yet their ability to perform low-level listening, such as pitch and duration detection, remains underexplored. However, low-level listening is critical for real-world, out-of-distribution tasks where models must reason about unfamiliar sounds based on fine-grained acoustic cues. To address this gap, we introduce the World-of-Whale benchmark (WoW-Bench) to evaluate low-level auditory perception and cognition using marine mammal vocalizations. WoW-bench is composed of a Perception benchmark for categorizing novel sounds and a Cognition benchmark, inspired by Bloom's taxonomy, to assess the abilities to remember, understand, apply, and analyze sound events. For the Cognition benchmark, we additionally introduce distractor questions to evaluate whether models are truly solving problems through listening rather than relying on other heuristics. Experiments with state-of-the-art LALMs show performance far below human levels, indicating a need for stronger auditory grounding in LALMs.

Title: MTS-Net: Dual-Enhanced Positional Multi-Head Self-Attention for 3D CT Diagnosis of May-Thurner Syndrome
Authors: Yixin Huang, Yiqi Jin, Ke Tao, Kaijian Xia, Jianfeng Gu, Lei Yu, Haojie Li, Lan Du, Cunjian Chen
Abstract: May-Thurner Syndrome (MTS) is a vascular condition that affects over 20\% of the population and significantly increases the risk of iliofemoral deep venous thrombosis. Accurate and early diagnosis of MTS using computed tomography (CT) remains a clinical challenge due to the subtle anatomical compression and variability across patients. In this paper, we propose MTS-Net, an end-to-end 3D deep learning framework designed to capture spatial-temporal patterns from CT volumes for reliable MTS diagnosis. MTS-Net builds upon 3D ResNet-18 by embedding a novel dual-enhanced positional multi-head self-attention (DEP-MHSA) module into the Transformer encoder of the network's final stages. The proposed DEP-MHSA employs multi-scale convolution and integrates positional embeddings into both attention weights and residual paths, enhancing spatial context preservation, which is crucial for identifying venous compression. To validate our approach, we curate the first publicly available dataset for MTS, MTS-CT, containing over 747 gender-balanced subjects with standard and enhanced CT scans. Experimental results demonstrate that MTS-Net achieves average 0.79 accuracy, 0.84 AUC, and 0.78 F1-score, outperforming baseline models including 3D ResNet, DenseNet-BC, and BabyNet. Our work not only introduces a new diagnostic architecture for MTS but also provides a high-quality benchmark dataset to facilitate future research in automated vascular syndrome detection. We make our code and dataset publicly available at:this https URL.

Title: Joint Beamforming and Antenna Position Optimization for IRS-Aided Multi-User Movable Antenna Systems
Authors: Yue Geng, Tee Hiang Cheng, Kai Zhong, Kah Chan Teh, Qingqing Wu
Abstract: Intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) and movable antenna (MA) technologies have been proposed to enhance wireless communications by creating favorable channel conditions. This paper investigates the joint beamforming and antenna position optimization for MA-enabled IRS (MA-IRS)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MU-MISO) communication systems, where the MA-IRS is deployed to aid the communication between the MA-enabled base station (BS) and user equipment (UE). In contrast to conventional fixed position antenna (FPA)-enabled IRS (FPA-IRS), the positions of the reflecting elements of the MA-IRS can be controlled to enhances the wireless channel. To verify the system's effectiveness and optimize its performance, we formulate a sum-rate maximization problem with a minimum rate threshold constraint for the MU-MISO communication. To tackle the non-convex problem, a product Riemannian manifold optimization (PRMO) method is proposed for the joint optimization of the beamforming and MA positions. Specifically, a product Riemannian manifold space (PRMS) is constructed and the corresponding Riemannian gradient is derived for updating the variables, and the Riemannian exact penalty (REP) method and a Riemannian Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (RBFGS) algorithm is exploited to obtain a feasible solution over the PRMS. Simulation results demonstrate that compared with the conventional FPA-IRS-aided communications, the reflecting elements of the MA-IRS can move to the positions with higher channel gain, thus enhancing the system performance. Furthermore, it is shown that optimizing the positions of the reflecting elements brings higher performance gain than controlling the phase shifts of the IRS, and integrating MA with IRS leads to higher performance gains compared to integrating MA with BS.

Title: A Symmetry-Preserving Reduced-Order Observer
Authors: Jeremy W. Hopwood, Craig A. Woolsey
Abstract: A symmetry-preserving, reduced-order state observer is presented for the unmeasured part of a system's state, where the nonlinear system dynamics exhibit symmetry under the action of a Lie group. Leveraging this symmetry with a moving frame, the observer dynamics are constructed such that they are invariant under the Lie group's action. Sufficient conditions for the observer to be asymptotically stable are developed by studying the stability of an invariant error system. As an illustrative example, the observer is applied to the problem of rigid-body velocity estimation, which demonstrates how exploiting the symmetry of the system can simplify the stabilization of the estimation error dynamics.

Title: Coevolution of Opinion Dynamics and Recommendation System: Modeling, Analysis and Reinforcement Learning Based Manipulation
Authors: Yuhong Chen, Xiaobing Dai, Martin Buss, Fangzhou Liu
Abstract: In this work, we develop an analytical framework that integrates opinion dynamics with a recommendation system. By incorporating elements such as collaborative filtering, we provide a precise characterization of how recommendation systems shape interpersonal interactions and influence opinion formation. Moreover, the property of the coevolution of both opinion dynamics and recommendation systems is also shown. Specifically, the convergence of this coevolutionary system is theoretically proved, and the mechanisms behind filter bubble formation are elucidated. Our analysis of the maximum number of opinion clusters shows how recommendation system parameters affect opinion grouping and polarization. Additionally, we incorporate the influence of propagators into our model and propose a reinforcement learning-based solution. The analysis and the propagation solution are demonstrated in simulations using the Yelp data set.

Title: TGOSPA Metric Parameters Selection and Evaluation for Visual Multi-object Tracking
Authors: Jan Krejčí, Oliver Kost, Ondřej Straka, Yuxuan Xia, Lennart Svensson, Ángel F. García-Fernández
Abstract: Multi-object tracking algorithms are deployed in various applications, each with different performance requirements. For example, track switches pose significant challenges for offline scene understanding, as they hinder the accuracy of data interpretation. Conversely, in online surveillance applications, their impact is often minimal. This disparity underscores the need for application-specific performance evaluations that are both simple and mathematically sound. The trajectory generalized optimal sub-pattern assignment (TGOSPA) metric offers a principled approach to evaluate multi-object tracking performance. It accounts for localization errors, the number of missed and false objects, and the number of track switches, providing a comprehensive assessment framework. This paper illustrates the effective use of the TGOSPA metric in computer vision tasks, addressing challenges posed by the need for application-specific scoring methodologies. By exploring the TGOSPA parameter selection, we enable users to compare, comprehend, and optimize the performance of algorithms tailored for specific tasks, such as target tracking and training of detector or re-ID modules.

Title: Fixed-Time Input-to-State Stability for Singularly Perturbed Systems via Composite Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Michael Tang, Miroslav Krstic, Jorge Poveda
Abstract: We study singularly perturbed systems that exhibit input-to-state stability (ISS) with fixed-time properties in the presence of bounded disturbances. In these systems, solutions converge to the origin within a time frame independent of initial conditions when undisturbed, and to a vicinity of the origin when subjected to bounded disturbances. First, we extend the traditional composite Lyapunov method, commonly applied in singular perturbation theory to analyze asymptotic stability, to include fixed-time ISS. We demonstrate that if both the reduced system and the boundary layer system exhibit fixed-time ISS, and if certain interconnection conditions are met, the entire multi-time scale system retains this fixed-time ISS characteristic, provided the separation of time scales is sufficiently pronounced. Next, we illustrate our findings via analytical and numerical examples, including a novel application in fixed-time feedback optimization for dynamic plants with slowly varying cost functions.

Title: Optimized Contact Plan Design for Reflector and Phased Array Terminals in Cislunar Space Networks
Authors: Huan Yan, Juan A. Fraire, Ziqi Yang, Kanglian Zhao, Wenfeng Li, Jinjun Zheng, Chengbin Kang, Huichao Zhou, Xinuo Chang, Lu Wang, Linshan Xue
Abstract: Cislunar space is emerging as a critical domain for human exploration, requiring robust infrastructure to support spatial users-spacecraft with navigation and communication demands. Deploying satellites at Earth-Moon three-body orbits offers an effective solution to construct cislunar space infrastructure (CLSI). However, scheduling satellite links to serve users necessitates an appropriate contact plan design (CPD) scheme. Existing CPD schemes focus solely on inter-satellite link scheduling, overlooking their role in providing services to users. This paper introduces a CPD scheme that considers two classes of satellite transponders: Reflector Links (RL) for high-volume data transfers and Phased Array Links (PL) for fast switching and navigation services. Our approach supports both satellites and spatial users in cislunar space. Simulations validate the scheme, demonstrating effective support for user while meeting satellite ranging and communication requirements. These findings provide essential insights for developing future Cislunar Space Infrastructures.

Title: A Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm for Sampling Jeffreys Prior
Authors: Yibo Shi, Braghadeesh Lakshminarayanan, Cristian R. Rojas
Abstract: Inference and estimation are fundamental in statistics, system identification, and machine learning. When prior knowledge about the system is available, Bayesian analysis provides a natural framework for encoding it through a prior distribution. In practice, such knowledge is often too vague to specify a full prior distribution, motivating the use of default 'uninformative' priors that minimize subjective bias. Jeffreys prior is an appealing uninformative prior because: (i) it is invariant under any re-parameterization of the model, (ii) it encodes the intrinsic geometric structure of the parameter space through the Fisher information matrix, which in turn enhances the diversity of parameter samples. Despite these benefits, drawing samples from Jeffreys prior is challenging. In this paper, we develop a general sampling scheme using the Metropolis-Adjusted Langevin Algorithm that enables sampling of parameter values from Jeffreys prior; the method extends naturally to nonlinear state-space models. The resulting samples can be directly used in sampling-based system identification methods and Bayesian experiment design, providing an objective, information-geometric description of parameter uncertainty. Several numerical examples demonstrate the efficiency and accuracy of the proposed scheme.

Title: Statistical Model and Estimation Method for Ranging a Moving Ship Using a Single Acoustic Receiver in Shallow Water
Authors: Junsu Jang, William S Hodgkiss, Florian Meyer
Abstract: Passive acoustics is a versatile tool for maritime situational awareness, enabling applications such as source detection and localization, marine mammal tracking, and geoacoustic inversion. This study focuses on estimating the range between an acoustic receiver and a transiting ship in an acoustically range-independent shallow water environment. Here, acoustic propagation can be modeled by a set of modes that are determined by the shallow water waveguide and seabed characteristics. These modes are dispersive, with phase and group velocities varying with frequency, and their interference produces striation patterns that depend on range and frequency in single-hydrophone spectrograms. These striation patterns can often be characterized by the waveguide invariant (WI), a single parameter describing the waveguide's properties. This paper presents a statistical model and corresponding WI-based range estimation approach using a single hydrophone, leveraging broadband and tonal sounds from a transiting ship. Using data from the Seabed Characterization Experiment 2017 (SBCEX17), the method was evaluated on two commercial ships under different environmental conditions and frequency bands. Range estimation errors remained below 4 % up to 62 km in the best case, with robust performance demonstrated in the 40-60 Hz band.

Title: Consensus Seminorms and their Applications
Authors: Ron Ofir, Ji Liu, A. Stephen Morse, Brian D. O. Anderson
Abstract: Consensus is a well-studied problem in distributed sensing, computation and control, yet deriving useful and easily computable bounds on the rate of convergence to consensus remains a challenge. This paper discusses the use of seminorms for this goal. A previously suggested family of seminorms is revisited, and an error made in their original presentation is corrected, where it was claimed that the a certain seminorm is equal to the well-known coefficient of ergodicity. Next, a wider family of seminorms is introduced, and it is shown that contraction in any of these seminorms guarantees convergence at an exponential rate of infinite products of matrices, generalizing known results on stochastic matrices to the class of matrices whose row sums are all equal one. Finally, it is shown that such seminorms cannot be used to bound the rate of convergence of classes larger than the well-known class of scrambling matrices.

Title: A critical note on the sideband peak count-index technique: failure for nonlinear damage characterization of impacted CFRP plates
Authors: Bernd Köhler, Frank Schubert
Abstract: It is widely accepted, that nonlinear elastodynamic methods are superior to linear methods in detecting early stages of material deterioration. A number of recently developed methods are reported to be particularly sensitive to nonlinearities and thus appropriate to indicate early damage. We applied systematically one of the methods, the sideband peak count index (SPC-I), to a series of increasingly damaged carbon fiber reinforced plastic (CFRP) plates. Our data leads to different conclusions. The SPC-I values are influenced by (usually undocumented) variations in the index calculation procedure, which is not acceptable for a robust method. Moreover, the behavior of the index when the ultrasound amplitude is varied contradicts material nonlinearity as a direct and significant contributor to the index value. To clarify the apparent contradiction of our results with the previously published statements, it is recommended that (a) our data are re-evaluated by independent researchers and (b) the experiments already published are repeated or (if sufficient data is availThe paper has been updated for submission to NDT&this http URL) also re-evaluated.

Title: Parallel GPT: Harmonizing the Independence and Interdependence of Acoustic and Semantic Information for Zero-Shot Text-to-Speech
Authors: Jingyuan Xing, Zhipeng Li, Jialong Mai, Xiaofen Xing, Xiangmin Xu
Abstract: Advances in speech representation and large language models have enhanced zero-shot text-to-speech (TTS) performance. However, existing zero-shot TTS models face challenges in capturing the complex correlations between acoustic and semantic features, resulting in a lack of expressiveness and similarity. The primary reason lies in the complex relationship between semantic and acoustic features, which manifests independent and interdependent this http URL paper introduces a TTS framework that combines both autoregressive (AR) and non-autoregressive (NAR) modules to harmonize the independence and interdependence of acoustic and semantic information. The AR model leverages the proposed Parallel Tokenizer to synthesize the top semantic and acoustic tokens simultaneously. In contrast, considering the interdependence, the Coupled NAR model predicts detailed tokens based on the general AR model's output. Parallel GPT, built on this architecture, is designed to improve zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis through its parallel structure. Experiments on English and Chinese datasets demonstrate that the proposed model significantly outperforms the quality and efficiency of the synthesis of existing zero-shot TTS models. Speech demos are available at this https URL.

Title: Model-based Multi-object Visual Tracking: Identification and Standard Model Limitations
Authors: Jan Krejčí, Oliver Kost, Yuxuan Xia, Lennart Svensson, Ondřej Straka
Abstract: This paper uses multi-object tracking methods known from the radar tracking community to address the problem of pedestrian tracking using 2D bounding box detections. The standard point-object (SPO) model is adopted, and the posterior density is computed using the Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter. The selection of the model parameters rooted in continuous time is discussed, including the birth and survival probabilities. Some parameters are selected from the first principles, while others are identified from the data, which is, in this case, the publicly available MOT-17 dataset. Although the resulting PMBM algorithm yields promising results, a mismatch between the SPO model and the data is revealed. The model-based approach assumes that modifying the problematic components causing the SPO model-data mismatch will lead to better model-based algorithms in future developments.

Title: Dimension-Decomposed Learning for Quadrotor Geometric Attitude Control with Almost Global Exponential Convergence on SO(3)
Authors: Tianhua Gao, Masashi Izumita, Kohji Tomita, Akiya Kamimura
Abstract: This paper introduces a lightweight and interpretable online learning approach called Dimension-Decomposed Learning (DiD-L) for disturbance identification in quadrotor geometric attitude control. As a module instance of DiD-L, we propose the Sliced Adaptive-Neuro Mapping (SANM). Specifically, to address underlying underfitting problems, the high-dimensional mapping for online identification is axially ``sliced" into multiple low-dimensional submappings (slices). In this way, the complex high-dimensional problem is decomposed into a set of simple low-dimensional subtasks addressed by shallow neural networks and adaptive laws. These neural networks and adaptive laws are updated online via Lyapunov-based adaptation without the persistent excitation (PE) condition. To enhance the interpretability of the proposed approach, we prove that the state solution of the rotational error dynamics exponentially converges into an arbitrarily small ball within an almost global attraction domain, despite time-varying disturbances and inertia uncertainties. This result is novel as it demonstrates exponential convergence without requiring pre-training for unseen disturbances and specific knowledge of the model. To our knowledge in the quadrotor control field, DiD-L is the first online learning approach that is lightweight enough to run in real-time at 400 Hz on microcontroller units (MCUs) such as STM32, and has been validated through real-world experiments.

Title: Lightweight Gradient Descent Optimization for Mitigating Hardware Imperfections in RIS Systems
Authors: Pedro H. C. de Souza (1), Luiz A. M. Pereira (1), Faustino R. Gómez (1), Elsa M. Materón (1), Jorge Ricardo Mejía-Salazar (1) ((1) National Institute of Telecommunications)
Abstract: Ongoing discussions about the future of wireless communications are reaching a turning point as standardization activities for the sixth generation of mobile networks (6G) become more mature. New technologies must now face renewed scrutiny by the industry and academia in order to be ready for deployment in the near future. Recently, reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) gained attention as a promising solution for improving the propagation conditions of signal transmission in general. The RIS is a planar array of tunable resonant elements designed to dynamically and precisely manipulate the reflection of incident electromagnetic waves. However, the physical structure of the RIS and its components may be subject to practical limitations and imperfections. It is imperative that the hardware imperfections (HWIs) associated with the RIS be analyzed, so that it remains a feasible technology from a practical standpoint. Moreover, solutions for mitigating the HWIs must be considered, as is discussed in this work. More specifically, we introduce a gradient descent optimization for mitigating HWIs in RIS-aided wideband communication systems. Numerical results show that the proposed optimization is able to compensate for HWIs such as the phase-shift noise (PSN) and RIS surface deformations.

Title: Code-Weight Sphere Decoding
Authors: Yubeen Jo, Geon Choi, Yongjune Kim, Namyoon Lee
Abstract: Ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) demand high-performance error-correcting codes and decoders in the finite blocklength regime. This letter introduces a novel two-stage near-maximum likelihood (near-ML) decoding framework applicable to any linear block code. Our approach first employs a low-complexity initial decoder. If this initial stage fails a cyclic redundancy check, it triggers a second stage: the proposed code-weight sphere decoding (WSD). WSD iteratively refines the codeword estimate by exploring a localized sphere of candidates constructed from pre-computed low-weight codewords. This strategy adaptively minimizes computational overhead at high signal-to-noise ratios while achieving near-ML performance, especially for low-rate codes. Extensive simulations demonstrate that our two-stage decoder provides an excellent trade-off between decoding reliability and complexity, establishing it as a promising solution for next-generation URLLC systems.

Authors: Yiqing Wang, Jian Zhou, Chen Pang, Wenyang Man, Zixiang Xiong, Ke Meng, Zhanling Wang, Yongzhen Li
Abstract: Polarimetric phased arrays (PPAs) enhance radar target detection and anti-jamming capabilities. However, the dual transmit/receive (T/R) channel requirement leads to high costs and system complexity. To address this, this paper introduces a polarization-coding reconfigurable phased array (PCRPA) and associated pattern synthesis techniques to reduce PPA costs while minimizing performance degradation. Each PCRPA element connects to a single T/R channel and incorporates two-level RF switches for real-time control of polarization states and waveforms. By adjusting element codes and excitation weights, the PCRPA can generate arbitrarily polarized and dual-polarized beams. Efficient beam pattern synthesis methods are also proposed, featuring novel optimization constraints derived from theoretical and analytical analysis of PCRPAs. Simulations demonstrate that the approach achieves low cross-polarization and sidelobe levels comparable to conventional architectures within the scan range, particularly for large arrays. However, the channel reduction inevitably incurs power and directivity loss. Experiments conducted on an $8\times 8$ X-band array antenna validate the effectiveness of the proposed system. The PCRPA and synthesis methods are well-suited for large-scale PPA systems, offering significant cost-effectiveness while maintaining good sidelobe suppression and polarization control performance.

Title: Learning Complex Motion Plans using Neural ODEs with Safety and Stability Guarantees
Authors: Farhad Nawaz, Tianyu Li, Nikolai Matni, Nadia Figueroa
Abstract: We propose a Dynamical System (DS) approach to learn complex, possibly periodic motion plans from kinesthetic demonstrations using Neural Ordinary Differential Equations (NODE). To ensure reactivity and robustness to disturbances, we propose a novel approach that selects a target point at each time step for the robot to follow, by combining tools from control theory and the target trajectory generated by the learned NODE. A correction term to the NODE model is computed online by solving a quadratic program that guarantees stability and safety using control Lyapunov functions and control barrier functions, respectively. Our approach outperforms baseline DS learning techniques on the LASA handwriting dataset and complex periodic trajectories. It is also validated on the Franka Emika robot arm to produce stable motions for wiping and stirring tasks that do not have a single attractor, while being robust to perturbations and safe around humans and obstacles.

Title: Ultrasound Autofocusing: Common Midpoint Phase Error Optimization via Differentiable Beamforming
Authors: Walter Simson, Louise Zhuang, Benjamin N. Frey, Sergio J. Sanabria, Jeremy J. Dahl, Dongwoon Hyun
Abstract: In ultrasound imaging, propagation of an acoustic wavefront through heterogeneous media causes phase aberrations that degrade the coherence of the reflected wavefront, leading to reduced image resolution and contrast. Adaptive imaging techniques attempt to correct this phase aberration and restore coherence, leading to improved focusing of the image. We propose an autofocusing paradigm for aberration correction in ultrasound imaging by fitting an acoustic velocity field to pressure measurements, via optimization of the common midpoint phase error (CMPE), using a straight-ray wave propagation model for beamforming in diffusely scattering media. We show that CMPE induced by heterogeneous acoustic velocity is a robust measure of phase aberration that can be used for acoustic autofocusing. CMPE is optimized iteratively using a differentiable beamforming approach to simultaneously improve the image focus while estimating the acoustic velocity field of the interrogated medium. The approach relies solely on wavefield measurements using a straight-ray integral solution of the two-way time-of-flight without explicit numerical time-stepping models of wave propagation. We demonstrate method performance through in silico simulations, in vitro phantom measurements, and in vivo mammalian models, showing practical applications in distributed aberration quantification, correction, and velocity estimation for medical ultrasound autofocusing.

Title: Noro: Noise-Robust One-shot Voice Conversion with Hidden Speaker Representation Learning
Authors: Haorui He, Yuchen Song, Yuancheng Wang, Haoyang Li, Xueyao Zhang, Li Wang, Gongping Huang, Eng Siong Chng, Zhizheng Wu
Abstract: The effectiveness of one-shot voice conversion (VC) decreases in real-world scenarios where reference speeches, which are often sourced from the internet, contain various disturbances like background noise. To address this issue, we introduce Noro, a noise-robust one-shot VC system. Noro features innovative components tailored for VC using noisy reference speeches, including a dual-branch reference encoding module and a noise-agnostic contrastive speaker loss. Experimental results demonstrate that Noro outperforms our baseline system in both clean and noisy scenarios, highlighting its efficacy for real-world applications. Additionally, we investigate the hidden speaker representation capabilities of our baseline system by repurposing its reference encoder as a speaker encoder. The results show that it is competitive with several advanced self-supervised learning models for speaker representation under the SUPERB settings, highlighting the potential for advancing speaker representation learning through one-shot VC tasks.

Title: Quantum Optimization for Optimal Power Flow: CVQLS-Augmented Interior Point Method
Authors: Farshad Amani, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: This paper presents a quantum-enhanced optimization approach for solving optimal power flow (OPF) by integrating the interior point method (IPM) with a coherent variational quantum linear solver (CVQLS). The objective is to explore the applicability of quantum computing to power systems optimization and address the associated challenges. A comparative analysis of state-of-the-art quantum linear solvers - Harrow-Hassidim-Lloyd (HHL), variational quantum linear solver (VQLS), and CVQLS - revealed that CVQLS is most suitable for OPF due to its stability with ill-conditioned matrices, such as the Hessian in IPM. To ensure high-quality solutions, prevent suboptimal convergence, and avoid the barren plateau problem, we propose a quantum circuit parameter initialization technique along with a method to guide the IPM along the central path. Moreover, we design an ansatz tailored for OPF, optimizing the expressibility and trainability of the quantum circuit to ensure efficient convergence and robustness in solving quantum OPF. Various optimizers are also tested for quantum circuit parameter optimization to select the best one. We evaluate our approaches on multiple systems to show their effectiveness in providing reliable OPF solutions. Simulations for the 2-bus system are conducted on a commercial IBMQ quantum device, while simulations for the other larger cases are performed using the IBM quantum simulator. While promising, CVQLS is limited by current quantum hardware, especially for larger systems. We use a quantum noise simulator to test scalability.

Title: Computational Extraction of Intonation and Tuning Systems from Multiple Microtonal Monophonic Vocal Recordings with Diverse Modes
Authors: Sepideh Shafiei, Shapour Hakam
Abstract: This paper presents a computational methodology for analyzing intonation and deriving tuning systems in microtonal oral traditions, utilizing pitch histograms, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), and optimization techniques, with a case study on a complete repertoire performed by a master of Iranian Classical Vocal Music (145 pieces). Pitch frequencies are extracted directly from vocal performances, and while alignment with MIDI notes is not a standard practice in our approach, we incorporate it where available, using DTW to refine interval analysis. By modeling intonation variations across multiple recordings, we derive structured tuning frameworks that capture both the flexibility of performance and the underlying systematic tendencies. Optimization techniques are applied to align intervals across the oral tradition repertoire, capturing the specific tunings and modal structures involved. Our methodology highlights the potential of computational techniques in advancing musicological and ethnomusicological research, offering a data-driven approach to defining tuning systems in microtonal vocal traditions.

Title: Enhanced Trust Region Sequential Convex Optimization for Multi-Drone Thermal Screening Trajectory Planning in Urban Environments
Authors: Kaiyuan Chen, Zhengjie Hu, Shaolin Zhang, Yuanqing Xia, Wannian Liang, Shuo Wang
Abstract: The rapid detection of abnormal body temperatures in urban populations is essential for managing public health risks, especially during outbreaks of infectious diseases. Multi-drone thermal screening systems offer promising solutions for fast, large-scale, and non-intrusive human temperature monitoring. However, trajectory planning for multiple drones in complex urban environments poses significant challenges, including collision avoidance, coverage efficiency, and constrained flight environments. In this study, we propose an enhanced trust region sequential convex optimization (TR-SCO) algorithm for optimal trajectory planning of multiple drones performing thermal screening tasks. Our improved algorithm integrates a refined convex optimization formulation within a trust region framework, effectively balancing trajectory smoothness, obstacle avoidance, altitude constraints, and maximum screening coverage. Simulation results demonstrate that our approach significantly improves trajectory optimality and computational efficiency compared to conventional convex optimization methods. This research provides critical insights and practical contributions toward deploying efficient multi-drone systems for real-time thermal screening in urban areas. For reader who are interested in our research, we release our source code at this https URL.

Title: TAG-WM: Tamper-Aware Generative Image Watermarking via Diffusion Inversion Sensitivity
Authors: Yuzhuo Chen, Zehua Ma, Han Fang, Weiming Zhang, Nenghai Yu
Abstract: AI-generated content (AIGC) enables efficient visual creation but raises copyright and authenticity risks. As a common technique for integrity verification and source tracing, digital image watermarking is regarded as a potential solution to above issues. However, the widespread adoption and advancing capabilities of generative image editing tools have amplified malicious tampering risks, while simultaneously posing new challenges to passive tampering detection and watermark robustness. To address these challenges, this paper proposes a Tamper-Aware Generative image WaterMarking method named TAG-WM. The proposed method comprises four key modules: a dual-mark joint sampling (DMJS) algorithm for embedding copyright and localization watermarks into the latent space while preserving generative quality, the watermark latent reconstruction (WLR) utilizing reversed DMJS, a dense variation region detector (DVRD) leveraging diffusion inversion sensitivity to identify tampered areas via statistical deviation analysis, and the tamper-aware decoding (TAD) guided by localization results. The experimental results demonstrate that TAG-WM achieves state-of-the-art performance in both tampering robustness and localization capability even under distortion, while preserving lossless generation quality and maintaining a watermark capacity of 256 bits. The code is available at: this https URL.

Title: Unscented Kalman Filter with a Nonlinear Propagation Model for Navigation Applications
Authors: Amit Levy, Itzik Klein
Abstract: The unscented Kalman filter is a nonlinear estimation algorithm commonly used in navigation applications. The prediction of the mean and covariance matrix is crucial to the stable behavior of the filter. This prediction is done by propagating the sigma points according to the dynamic model at hand. In this paper, we introduce an innovative method to propagate the sigma points according to the nonlinear dynamic model of the navigation error state vector. This improves the filter accuracy and navigation performance. We demonstrate the benefits of our proposed approach using real sensor data recorded by an autonomous underwater vehicle during several scenarios.

Title: Canonical Bayesian Linear System Identification
Authors: Andrey Bryutkin, Matthew E. Levine, Iñigo Urteaga, Youssef Marzouk
Abstract: Standard Bayesian approaches for linear time-invariant (LTI) system identification are hindered by parameter non-identifiability; the resulting complex, multi-modal posteriors make inference inefficient and impractical. We solve this problem by embedding canonical forms of LTI systems within the Bayesian framework. We rigorously establish that inference in these minimal parameterizations fully captures all invariant system dynamics (e.g., transfer functions, eigenvalues, predictive distributions of system outputs) while resolving identifiability. This approach unlocks the use of meaningful, structure-aware priors (e.g., enforcing stability via eigenvalues) and ensures conditions for a Bernstein--von Mises theorem -- a link between Bayesian and frequentist large-sample asymptotics that is broken in standard forms. Extensive simulations with modern MCMC methods highlight advantages over standard parameterizations: canonical forms achieve higher computational efficiency, generate interpretable and well-behaved posteriors, and provide robust uncertainty estimates, particularly from limited data.

Title: Advancing Speech Quality Assessment Through Scientific Challenges and Open-source Activities
Authors: Wen-Chin Huang
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) refers to the evaluation of speech quality, and developing an accurate automatic SQA method that reflects human perception has become increasingly important, in order to keep up with the generative AI boom. In recent years, SQA has progressed to a point that researchers started to faithfully use automatic SQA in research papers as a rigorous measurement of goodness for speech generation systems. We believe that the scientific challenges and open-source activities of late have stimulated the growth in this field. In this paper, we review recent challenges as well as open-source implementations and toolkits for SQA, and highlight the importance of maintaining such activities to facilitate the development of not only SQA itself but also generative AI for speech.

Title: Closed-Form BER Analysis for Uplink NOMA with Dynamic SIC Decoding
Authors: Hequn Zhang, Qu Luo, Pei Xiao, Yue Zhang, Huiyu Zhou
Abstract: This paper, for the first time, presents a closed-form error performance analysis of uplink power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) with dynamic successive interference cancellation (SIC) decoding, where the decoding order is adapted to the instantaneous channel conditions. We first develop an analytical framework that characterizes how dynamic ordering affects error probabilities in uplink PD-NOMA systems. For a two-user system over independent and non-identically distributed Rayleigh fading channels, we derive closed-form probability density functions (PDFs) of ordered channel gains and the corresponding unconditional pairwise error probabilities (PEPs). To address the mathematical complexity of characterizing ordered channel distributions, we employ a Gaussian fitting to approximate truncated distributions while maintaining analytical tractability. Finally, we extend the bit error rate analysis for various $M$-quadrature amplitude modulation schemes (QAM) in both homogeneous and heterogeneous scenarios. Numerical results validate the theoretical analysis and demonstrate that dynamic SIC eliminates the error floor issue observed in fixed-order SIC, achieving significantly improved performance in high signal-to-noise ratio regions. Our findings also highlight that larger power differences are essential for higher-order modulations, offering concrete guidance for practical uplink PD-NOMA deployment.

Title: Residual Neural Terminal Constraint for MPC-based Collision Avoidance in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Bojan Derajić, Mohamed-Khalil Bouzidi, Sebastian Bernhard, Wolfgang Hönig
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a hybrid MPC local planner that uses a learning-based approximation of a time-varying safe set, derived from local observations and applied as the MPC terminal constraint. This set can be represented as a zero-superlevel set of the value function computed via Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis, which is infeasible in real-time. We exploit the property that the HJ value function can be expressed as a difference of the corresponding signed distance function (SDF) and a non-negative residual function. The residual component is modeled as a neural network with non-negative output and subtracted from the computed SDF, resulting in a real-time value function estimate that is at least as safe as the SDF by design. Additionally, we parametrize the neural residual by a hypernetwork to improve real-time performance and generalization properties. The proposed method is compared with three state-of-the-art methods in simulations and hardware experiments, achieving up to 30\% higher success rates compared to the best baseline while requiring a similar computational effort and producing high-quality (low travel-time) solutions.

Title: Privacy-Aware Detection of Fake Identity Documents: Methodology, Benchmark, and Improved Algorithms (FakeIDet2)
Authors: Javier Muñoz-Haro, Ruben Tolosana, Julian Fierrez, Ruben Vera-Rodriguez, Aythami Morales
Abstract: Remote user verification in Internet-based applications is becoming increasingly important nowadays. A popular scenario for it consists of submitting a picture of the user's Identity Document (ID) to a service platform, authenticating its veracity, and then granting access to the requested digital service. An ID is well-suited to verify the identity of an individual, since it is government issued, unique, and nontransferable. However, with recent advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI), attackers can surpass security measures in IDs and create very realistic physical and synthetic fake IDs. Researchers are now trying to develop methods to detect an ever-growing number of these AI-based fakes that are almost indistinguishable from authentic (bona fide) IDs. In this counterattack effort, researchers are faced with an important challenge: the difficulty in using real data to train fake ID detectors. This real data scarcity for research and development is originated by the sensitive nature of these documents, which are usually kept private by the ID owners (the users) and the ID Holders (e.g., government, police, bank, etc.). The main contributions of our study are: 1) We propose and discuss a patch-based methodology to preserve privacy in fake ID detection research. 2) We provide a new public database, FakeIDet2-db, comprising over 900K real/fake ID patches extracted from 2,000 ID images, acquired using different smartphone sensors, illumination and height conditions, etc. In addition, three physical attacks are considered: print, screen, and composite. 3) We present a new privacy-aware fake ID detection method, FakeIDet2. 4) We release a standard reproducible benchmark that considers physical and synthetic attacks from popular databases in the literature.

Title: Seeing is Believing: Emotion-Aware Audio-Visual Language Modeling for Expressive Speech Generation
Authors: Weiting Tan, Jiachen Lian, Hirofumi Inaguma, Paden Tomasello, Philipp Koehn, Xutai Ma
Abstract: We present an Audio-Visual Language Model (AVLM) for expressive speech generation by integrating full-face visual cues into a pre-trained expressive speech model. We explore multiple visual encoders and multimodal fusion strategies during pre-training to identify the most effective integration approach. Subsequent fine-tuning on emotion recognition and expressive dialogue tasks yields substantial gains over speech-only baselines (e.g., +5 F1 in emotion recognition). AVLM highlights the value of expressive visual information in guiding speech generation and offers a foundation for end-to-end multimodal conversational systems.

Title: Distributed Implementation of Variational Quantum Eigensolver to Solve QUBO Problems
Authors: Milad Hasanzadeh, Amin Kargarian
Abstract: We present a distributed algorithm and implementation of the variational quantum eigensolver (VQE), termed distributed VQE (DVQE). DVQE, provided as an open-source Python package, enables the execution of parameterized quantum circuits across multiple logical quantum processing units (QPUs) in a distributed fashion. This approach addresses key hardware limitations of near-term quantum devices, including restricted qubit counts and limited circuit depth. Distributed ansatz circuits are constructed to preserve the quantum state fidelity of their monolithic counterparts, allowing consistent energy estimation while distributing the computational load. To improve the convergence and robustness of the optimization loop for identifying the variational parameters of the DVQE ansatz circuit, we use the ADAM optimizer in combination with metaheuristic initialization strategies, which outperform random initialization across various test cases. The complete DVQE pipeline is implemented in a modular Python package that accepts QUBO problems as input and supports monolithic and distributed execution modes. The framework leverages Qiskit to construct and simulate distributed circuits, and includes an internal greedy algorithm for automatic qubit allocation across multiple QPUs. Simulation results on QUBO benchmarks confirm the correctness of the approach, paving the way for real QPU deployment and further exploration of distributed quantum optimization. \textbf{The simulator is publicly available on \href{this https URL}{GitHub} under a package named raiselab, with a collection of tutorial examples.}

Title: Performance Analysis of IEEE 802.11bn with Coordinated TDMA on Real-Time Applications
Authors: Seungmin Lee, Changmin Lee, Si-Chan Noh, Joonsoo Lee
Abstract: Wi-Fi plays a crucial role in connecting electronic devices and providing communication services in everyday life. Recently, there has been a growing demand for services that require low-latency communication, such as real-time applications. The latest amendments to Wi-Fi, IEEE 802.11bn, are being developed to address these demands with technologies such as the multiple access point coordination (MAPC). In this paper, we demonstrate that coordinated TDMA (Co-TDMA), one of the MAPC techniques, effectively reduces the latency of transmitting time-sensitive traffic. In particular, we focus on worst-case latency and jitter, which are key metrics for evaluating the performance of real-time applications. We first introduce a Co-TDMA scheduling strategy. We then investigate how this scheduling strategy impacts latency under varying levels of network congestion and traffic volume characteristics. Finally, we validate our findings through system-level simulations. Our simulation results demonstrate that Co-TDMA effectively mitigates jitter and worst-case latency for low-latency traffic, with the latter exhibiting an improvement of approximately 24%.

Title: Constraint Learning in Multi-Agent Dynamic Games from Demonstrations of Local Nash Interactions
Authors: Zhouyu Zhang, Chih-Yuan Chiu, Glen Chou
Abstract: We present an inverse dynamic game-based algorithm to learn parametric constraints from a given dataset of local generalized Nash equilibrium interactions between multiple agents. Specifically, we introduce mixed-integer linear programs (MILP) encoding the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions of the interacting agents, which recover constraints consistent with the Nash stationarity of the interaction demonstrations. We establish theoretical guarantees that our method learns inner approximations of the true safe and unsafe sets, as well as limitations of constraint learnability from demonstrations of Nash equilibrium interactions. We also use the interaction constraints recovered by our method to design motion plans that robustly satisfy the underlying constraints. Across simulations and hardware experiments, our methods proved capable of inferring constraints and designing interactive motion plans for various classes of constraints, both convex and non-convex, from interaction demonstrations of agents with nonlinear dynamics.

Title: HPC Digital Twins for Evaluating Scheduling Policies, Incentive Structures and their Impact on Power and Cooling
Authors: Matthias Maiterth, Wesley H. Brewer, Jaya S. Kuruvella, Arunavo Dey, Tanzima Z. Islam, Kevin Menear, Dmitry Duplyakin, Rashadul Kabir, Tapasya Patki, Terry Jones, Feiyi Wang
Abstract: Schedulers are critical for optimal resource utilization in high-performance computing. Traditional methods to evaluate schedulers are limited to post-deployment analysis, or simulators, which do not model associated infrastructure. In this work, we present the first-of-its-kind integration of scheduling and digital twins in HPC. This enables what-if studies to understand the impact of parameter configurations and scheduling decisions on the physical assets, even before deployment, or regarching changes not easily realizable in production. We (1) provide the first digital twin framework extended with scheduling capabilities, (2) integrate various top-tier HPC systems given their publicly available datasets, (3) implement extensions to integrate external scheduling simulators. Finally, we show how to (4) implement and evaluate incentive structures, as-well-as (5) evaluate machine learning based scheduling, in such novel digital-twin based meta-framework to prototype scheduling. Our work enables what-if scenarios of HPC systems to evaluate sustainability, and the impact on the simulated system.
