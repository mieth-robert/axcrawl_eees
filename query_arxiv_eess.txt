Title: Neural Brain Fields: A NeRF-Inspired Approach for Generating Nonexistent EEG Electrodes
Authors: Shahar Ain Kedem, Itamar Zimerman, Eliya Nachmani
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) data present unique modeling challenges because recordings vary in length, exhibit very low signal to noise ratios, differ significantly across participants, drift over time within sessions, and are rarely available in large and clean datasets. Consequently, developing deep learning methods that can effectively process EEG signals remains an open and important research problem. To tackle this problem, this work presents a new method inspired by Neural Radiance Fields (NeRF). In computer vision, NeRF techniques train a neural network to memorize the appearance of a 3D scene and then uses its learned parameters to render and edit the scene from any viewpoint. We draw an analogy between the discrete images captured from different viewpoints used to learn a continuous 3D scene in NeRF, and EEG electrodes positioned at different locations on the scalp, which are used to infer the underlying representation of continuous neural activity. Building on this connection, we show that a neural network can be trained on a single EEG sample in a NeRF style manner to produce a fixed size and informative weight vector that encodes the entire signal. Moreover, via this representation we can render the EEG signal at previously unseen time steps and spatial electrode positions. We demonstrate that this approach enables continuous visualization of brain activity at any desired resolution, including ultra high resolution, and reconstruction of raw EEG signals. Finally, our empirical analysis shows that this method can effectively simulate nonexistent electrodes data in EEG recordings, allowing the reconstructed signal to be fed into standard EEG processing networks to improve performance.

Title: Modeling Day-Long ECG Signals to Predict Heart Failure Risk with Explainable AI
Authors: Eran Zvuloni, Ronit Almog, Michael Glikson, Shany Brimer Biton, Ilan Green, Izhar Laufer, Offer Amir, Joachim A. Behar
Abstract: Heart failure (HF) affects 11.8% of adults aged 65 and older, reducing quality of life and longevity. Preventing HF can reduce morbidity and mortality. We hypothesized that artificial intelligence (AI) applied to 24-hour single-lead electrocardiogram (ECG) data could predict the risk of HF within five years. To research this, the Technion-Leumit Holter ECG (TLHE) dataset, including 69,663 recordings from 47,729 patients, collected over 20 years was used. Our deep learning model, DeepHHF, trained on 24-hour ECG recordings, achieved an area under the receiver operating characteristic curve of 0.80 that outperformed a model using 30-second segments and a clinical score. High-risk individuals identified by DeepHHF had a two-fold chance of hospitalization or death incidents. Explainability analysis showed DeepHHF focused on arrhythmias and heart abnormalities, with key attention between 8 AM and 3 PM. This study highlights the feasibility of deep learning to model 24-hour continuous ECG data, capturing paroxysmal events and circadian variations essential for reliable risk prediction. Artificial intelligence applied to single-lead Holter ECG is non-invasive, inexpensive, and widely accessible, making it a promising tool for HF risk prediction.

Title: Deep Learning Approach for the Diagnosis of Pediatric Pneumonia Using Chest X-ray Imaging
Authors: Fatemeh Hosseinabadi, Mohammad Mojtaba Rohani
Abstract: Pediatric pneumonia remains a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in children worldwide. Timely and accurate diagnosis is critical but often challenged by limited radiological expertise and the physiological and procedural complexity of pediatric imaging. This study investigates the performance of state-of-the-art convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures ResNetRS, RegNet, and EfficientNetV2 using transfer learning for the automated classification of pediatric chest Xray images as either pneumonia or normal.A curated subset of 1,000 chest X-ray images was extracted from a publicly available dataset originally comprising 5,856 pediatric images. All images were preprocessed and labeled for binary classification. Each model was fine-tuned using pretrained ImageNet weights and evaluated based on accuracy and sensitivity. RegNet achieved the highest classification performance with an accuracy of 92.4 and a sensitivity of 90.1, followed by ResNetRS (accuracy: 91.9, sensitivity: 89.3) and EfficientNetV2 (accuracy: 88.5, sensitivity: 88.1).

Title: Learning Speech Representations with Variational Predictive Coding
Authors: Sung-Lin Yeh, Peter Bell, Hao Tang
Abstract: Despite being the best known objective for learning speech representations, the HuBERT objective has not been further developed and improved. We argue that it is the lack of an underlying principle that stalls the development, and, in this paper, we show that predictive coding under a variational view is the principle behind the HuBERT objective. Due to its generality, our formulation provides opportunities to improve parameterization and optimization, and we show two simple modifications that bring immediate improvements to the HuBERT objective. In addition, the predictive coding formulation has tight connections to various other objectives, such as APC, CPC, wav2vec, and BEST-RQ. Empirically, the improvement in pre-training brings significant improvements to four downstream tasks: phone classification, f0 tracking, speaker recognition, and automatic speech recognition, highlighting the importance of the predictive coding interpretation.

Title: Adaptive Pinching Antenna Optimization via Meta-Learning for Physical-Layer Security in Dynamic Wireless Networks
Authors: Khalid T. Musri, Akram Y. Sarhan, Osamah A. Abdullah, Hayder Al-Hraishawi
Abstract: This paper develops a gradient-based meta-learning framework for real-time control of waveguided pinching-antenna systems under user-location uncertainty and physical-layer security (PLS) constraints. A probabilistic system model is introduced to capture the impact of imperfect localization on outage performance and secrecy. Based on this model, a joint antenna-positioning and transmit-power optimization problem is formulated to satisfy probabilistic reliability and secrecy requirements. To enable rapid adaptation in highly dynamic environments, the proposed approach employs model-agnostic meta-learning (MAML) to learn a transferable initialization across diverse mobility and channel conditions, allowing few-shot online adaptation using limited pilot feedback. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework significantly outperforms Reptile-based meta-learning, non-meta reinforcement learning, conventional optimization, static antenna placement, and power-only control in terms of outage probability, secrecy performance, and convergence latency. These results establish meta-learning as an effective tool for secure and low-latency control of reconfigurable pinching-antenna systems in non-stationary wireless environments.

Title: AI-Driven Channel State Information (CSI) Extrapolation for 6G: Current Situations, Challenges and Future Research
Authors: Yuan Gao, Zichen Lu, Xinyi Wu, Wenjun Yu, Shengli Liu, Jianbo Du, Yanliang Jin, Shunqing Zhang, Xiaoli Chu, Shugong Xu
Abstract: CSI extrapolation is an effective method for acquiring channel state information (CSI), essential for optimizing performance of sixth-generation (6G) communication systems. Traditional channel estimation methods face scalability challenges due to the surging overhead in emerging high-mobility, extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (EL-MIMO), and multi-band systems. CSI extrapolation techniques mitigate these challenges by using partial CSI to infer complete CSI, significantly reducing overhead. Despite growing interest, a comprehensive review of state-of-the-art (SOTA) CSI extrapolation techniques is lacking. This paper addresses this gap by comprehensively reviewing the current status, challenges, and future directions of CSI extrapolation for the first time. Firstly, we analyze the performance metrics specific to CSI extrapolation in 6G, including extrapolation accuracy, adaption to dynamic scenarios and algorithm costs. We then review both model-driven and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven approaches for time, frequency, antenna, and multi-domain CSI extrapolation. Key insights and takeaways from these methods are summarized. Given the promise of AI-driven methods in meeting performance requirements, we also examine the open-source channel datasets and simulators that could be used to train high-performance AI-driven CSI extrapolation models. Finally, we discuss the critical challenges of the existing research and propose perspective research opportunities.

Title: Hear the Heartbeat in Phases: Physiologically Grounded Phase-Aware ECG Biometrics
Authors: Jintao Huang, Lu Leng, Yi Zhang, Ziyuan Yang
Abstract: Electrocardiography (ECG) is adopted for identity authentication in wearable devices due to its individual-specific characteristics and inherent liveness. However, existing methods often treat heartbeats as homogeneous signals, overlooking the phase-specific characteristics within the cardiac cycle. To address this, we propose a Hierarchical Phase-Aware Fusion~(HPAF) framework that explicitly avoids cross-feature entanglement through a three-stage design. In the first stage, Intra-Phase Representation (IPR) independently extracts representations for each cardiac phase, ensuring that phase-specific morphological and variation cues are preserved without interference from other phases. In the second stage, Phase-Grouped Hierarchical Fusion (PGHF) aggregates physiologically related phases in a structured manner, enabling reliable integration of complementary phase information. In the final stage, Global Representation Fusion (GRF) further combines the grouped representations and adaptively balances their contributions to produce a unified and discriminative identity representation. Moreover, considering ECG signals are continuously acquired, multiple heartbeats can be collected for each individual. We propose a Heartbeat-Aware Multi-prototype (HAM) enrollment strategy, which constructs a multi-prototype gallery template set to reduce the impact of heartbeat-specific noise and variability. Extensive experiments on three public datasets demonstrate that HPAF achieves state-of-the-art results in the comparison with other methods under both closed and open-set settings.

Title: Edge AI Inference in ISCC Networks: Sensing Accuracy Analysis and Precoding Design
Authors: Lingyun Xu, Bowen Wang, Huiyong Li, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: This work explores the relationship between sensing accuracy and precoding coefficients for edge artificial intelligence (AI) inference in integrated sensing, communication and computation (ISCC) networks. We start by constructing a system model of an over-the-air-empowered ISCC network for edge AI inference, involving distributed edge sensors for feature extraction and an edge server for classification. Based on this model, we introduce a discriminant gain (DG) to characterize sensing accuracy and novelly derive an explicit function of the DG about precoding coefficients, giving valuable insights into precoding design. Guided by this, we propose an effective precoding algorithm to solve a non-convex DG-maximization problem. Simulation results verify the effectiveness and feasibility of the proposed design for edge inference in ISCC networks.

Title: Impact of Clustering on the Observability and Controllability of Complex Networks
Authors: Mohammadreza Doostmohammadian, Hamid R. Rabiee
Abstract: The increasing complexity and interconnectedness of systems across various fields have led to a growing interest in studying complex networks, particularly Scale-Free (SF) networks, which best model real-world systems. This paper investigates the influence of clustering on the observability and controllability of complex SF networks, framing these characteristics in the context of structured systems theory. In this paper, we show that densely clustered networks require fewer driver and observer nodes due to better information propagation within clusters. This relationship is of interest for optimizing network design in applications such as social networks and intelligent transportation systems. We first quantify the network observability/controllability requirements, and then, through Monte-Carlo simulations and different case studies, we show how clustering affects these metrics. Our findings offer practical insights into reducing control and observer nodes for sensor/actuator placement, particularly in resource-constrained setups. This work contributes to the understanding of network observability/controllability and presents techniques for improving these features through alterations in network structure and clustering.

Title: Let Distortion Guide Restoration (DGR): A physics-informed learning framework for Prostate Diffusion MRI
Authors: Ziyang Long, Binesh Nader, Lixia Wang, Archana Vadiraj Malaji, Chia-Chi Yang, Haoran Sun, Rola Saouaf, Timothy Daskivich, Hyung Kim, Yibin Xie, Debiao Li, Hsin-Jung Yang
Abstract: We present Distortion-Guided Restoration (DGR), a physics-informed hybrid CNN-diffusion framework for acquisition-free correction of severe susceptibility-induced distortions in prostate single-shot EPI diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). DGR is trained to invert a realistic forward distortion model using large-scale paired distorted and undistorted data synthesized from distortion-free prostate DWI and co-registered T2-weighted images from 410 multi-institutional studies, together with 11 measured B0 field maps from metal-implant cases incorporated into a forward simulator to generate low-b DWI (b = 50 s per mm squared), high-b DWI (b = 1400 s per mm squared), and ADC distortions. The network couples a CNN-based geometric correction module with conditional diffusion refinement under T2-weighted anatomical guidance. On a held-out synthetic validation set (n = 34) using ground-truth simulated distortion fields, DGR achieved higher PSNR and lower NMSE than FSL TOPUP and FUGUE. In 34 real clinical studies with severe distortion, including hip prostheses and marked rectal distension, DGR improved geometric fidelity and increased radiologist-rated image quality and diagnostic confidence. Overall, learning the inverse of a physically simulated forward process provides a practical alternative to acquisition-dependent distortion-correction pipelines for prostate DWI.

Title: Next Generation Intelligent Low-Altitude Economy Deployments: The O-RAN Perspective
Authors: Aly Sabri Abdalla, Vuk Marojevic
Abstract: Despite the growing interest in low-altitude economy (LAE) applications, including UAV-based logistics and emergency response, fundamental challenges remain in orchestrating such missions over complex, signal-constrained environments. These include the absence of real-time, resilient, and context-aware orchestration of aerial nodes with limited integration of artificial intelligence (AI) specialized for LAE missions. This paper introduces an open radio access network (O-RAN)-enabled LAE framework that leverages seamless coordination between the disaggregated RAN architecture, open interfaces, and RAN intelligent controllers (RICs) to facilitate closed-loop, AI-optimized, and mission-critical LAE operations. We evaluate the feasibility and performance of the proposed architecture via a semantic-aware rApp that acts as a terrain interpreter, offering semantic guidance to a reinforcement learning-enabled xApp, which performs real-time trajectory planning for LAE swarm nodes. We survey the capabilities of UAV testbeds that can be leveraged for LAE research, and present critical research challenges and standardization needs.

Title: Impact Assessment of Heterogeneous Grid Support Functions in Smart Inverter Deployments
Authors: S. Gokul Krishnan, Mohd. Asim Aftab, Nabil Mohammed, Shehab Ahmed, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: The decarbonization of the energy sector has led to a significant high penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs), particularly photovoltaic (PV) systems, in low-voltage (LV) distribution networks. To maintain grid stability, recent standards (e.g., IEEE 1547-2018) mandate DERs to provide grid-support functionalities through smart inverters (SIs), which typically operate autonomously based on local measurements. However, as DER penetration increases, uncoordinated control modes of SIs can lead to adverse interactions, compromising system efficiency, voltage regulation, and overall stability. While previous studies have demonstrated the benefits of coordinated inverter control and optimal dispatch strategies, the system-wide impacts of heterogeneous SI groups operating under different control modes remain largely unexamined. This paper addresses this gap by assessing the dynamic interactions among multiple SI groups with varying control strategies, namely: Constant Power Factor (CPF), Volt-VAR, and Volt-Watt modes. Furthermore, the analysis covers both resistive and inductive feeder types. The validation is performed using a real-time setup. The CIRGE low-voltage (LV) distribution network is simulated in the Opal-RT platform as the test network, enabling realistic and high-fidelity evaluation of SI control interactions under practical grid conditions.

Title: The Impact of Lesion Focus on the Performance of AI-Based Melanoma Classification
Authors: Tanay Donde
Abstract: Melanoma is the most lethal subtype of skin cancer, and early and accurate detection of this disease can greatly improve patients' outcomes. Although machine learning models, especially convolutional neural networks (CNNs), have shown great potential in automating melanoma classification, their diagnostic reliability still suffers due to inconsistent focus on lesion areas. In this study, we analyze the relationship between lesion attention and diagnostic performance, involving masked images, bounding box detection, and transfer learning. We used multiple explainability and sensitivity analysis approaches to investigate how well models aligned their attention with lesion areas and how this alignment correlated with precision, recall, and F1-score. Results showed that models with a higher focus on lesion areas achieved better diagnostic performance, suggesting the potential of interpretable AI in medical diagnostics. This study provides a foundation for developing more accurate and trustworthy melanoma classification models in the future.

Title: Time--to--Digital Converter (TDC)--Based Resonant Compute--in--Memory for INT8 CNNs with Layer--Optimized SRAM Mapping
Authors: Dhandeep Challagundla, Ignatius Bezzam, Riadul Islam
Abstract: In recent years, Compute-in-memory (CiM) architectures have emerged as a promising solution for deep neural network (NN) accelerators. Multiply-accumulate~(MAC) is considered a {\textit de facto} unit operation in NNs. By leveraging the inherent parallel processing capabilities of CiM, NNs that require numerous MAC operations can be executed more efficiently. This is further facilitated by storing the weights in SRAM, reducing the need for extensive data movement and enhancing overall computational speed and efficiency. Traditional CiM architectures execute MAC operations in the analog domain, employing an Analog-to-Digital converter (ADC) to convert the analog MAC values into digital outputs. However, these ADCs introduce significant increase in area and power consumption, as well as introduce non-linearities. This work proposes a resonant time-domain compute-in-memory (TDC-CiM) architecture that eliminates the need for an ADC by using a time-to-digital converter (TDC) to digitize analog MAC results with lower power and area cost. A dedicated 8T SRAM cell enables reliable bitwise MAC operations, while the readout uses a 4-bit TDC with pulse-shrinking delay elements, achieving 1 GS/s sampling with a power consumption of only 1.25 mW. In addition, a weight stationary data mapping strategy combined with an automated SRAM macro selection algorithm enables scalable and energy-efficient deployment across CNN workloads. Evaluation across six CNN models shows that the algorithm reduces inference energy consumption by up to 8x when scaling SRAM size from 32~KB to 256~KB, while maintaining minimal accuracy loss after quantization. The feasibility of the proposed architecture is validated on an 8~KB SRAM memory array using TSMC 28~nm technology. The proposed TDC-CiM architecture demonstrates a throughput of 320~GOPS with an energy efficiency of 38.46~TOPS/W.

Title: Safety for Weakly-Hard Control Systems via Graph-Based Barrier Functions
Authors: Marc Seidel, Mahathi Anand, Frank Allgöwer
Abstract: Despite significant advancement in technology, communication and computational failures are still prevalent in safety-critical engineering applications. Often, networked control systems experience packet dropouts, leading to open-loop behavior that significantly affects the behavior of the system. Similarly, in real-time control applications, control tasks frequently experience computational overruns and thus occasionally no new actuator command is issued. This article addresses the safety verification and controller synthesis problem for a class of control systems subject to weakly-hard constraints, i.e., a set of window-based constraints where the number of failures are bounded within a given time horizon. The results are based on a new notion of graph-based barrier functions that are specifically tailored to the considered system class, offering a set of constraints whose satisfaction leads to safety guarantees despite communication failures. Subsequent reformulations of the safety constraints are proposed to alleviate conservatism and improve computational tractability, and the resulting trade-offs are discussed. Finally, several numerical case studies demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach.

Title: MIMO-AFDM Outperforms MIMO-OFDM in the Face of Hardware Impairments
Authors: Zeping Sui, Zilong Liu, Leila Musavian, Yong Liang Guan, Lie-Liang Yang, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: The impact of both multiplicative and additive hardware impairments (HWIs) on multiple-input multiple-output affine frequency division multiplexing (MIMO-AFDM) systems is investigated. For small-scale MIMO-AFDM systems, a tight bit error rate (BER) upper bound associated with the maximum likelihood (ML) detector is derived. By contrast, for large-scale systems, a closed-form BER approximation associated with the linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector is presented, including realistic imperfect channel estimation scenarios. Our first key observation is that the full diversity order of a hardware-impaired AFDM system remains unaffected, which is a unique advantage. Furthermore, our analysis shows that 1) the BER results derived accurately predict the simulated ML performance in moderate-to-high signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs), while the theoretical BER curve of the LMMSE detector closely matches that of the Monte-Carlo based one. 2) MIMO-AFDM is more resilient to multiplicative distortions, such as phase noise and carrier frequency offset, compared to its orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) counterparts. This is attributed to its inherent chirp signal characteristics; 3) MIMO-AFDM consistently achieves superior BER performance compared to conventional MIMO-OFDM systems under the same additive HWI conditions, as well as different velocity values. The latter is because MIMO-AFDM is also resilient to the additional inter-carrier interference (ICI) imposed by the nonlinear distortions of additive HWIs. In a nutshell, compared to OFDM, AFDM demonstrates stronger ICI resilience and achieves the maximum full diversity attainable gain even under HWIs, thanks to its intrinsic chirp signalling structure as well as to the beneficial spreading effect of the discrete affine Fourier transform.

Title: Probability-Aware Parking Selection
Authors: Cameron Hickert, Sirui Li, Zhengbing He, Cathy Wu
Abstract: Current parking navigation systems often underestimate total travel time by failing to account for the time spent searching for a parking space, which significantly affects user experience, mode choice, congestion, and emissions. To address this issue, this paper introduces the probability-aware parking selection problem, which aims to direct drivers to the best parking location rather than straight to their destination. An adaptable dynamic programming framework is proposed for decision-making based on probabilistic information about parking availability at the parking lot level. Closed-form analysis determines when it is optimal to target a specific parking lot or explore alternatives, as well as the expected time cost. Sensitivity analysis and three illustrative cases are examined, demonstrating the model's ability to account for the dynamic nature of parking availability. Acknowledging the financial costs of permanent sensing infrastructure, the paper provides analytical and empirical assessments of errors incurred when leveraging stochastic observations to estimate parking availability. Experiments with real-world data from the US city of Seattle indicate this approach's viability, with mean absolute error decreasing from 7% to below 2% as observation frequency grows. In data-based simulations, probability-aware strategies demonstrate time savings up to 66% relative to probability-unaware baselines, yet still take up to 123% longer than direct-to-destination estimates.

Title: Parametrized Sharing for Multi-Agent Hybrid DRL for Multiple Multi-Functional RISs-Aided Downlink NOMA Networks
Authors: Chi-Te Kuo, Li-Hsiang Shen, Jyun-Jhe Huang
Abstract: Multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) is conceived to address the communication efficiency thanks to its extended signal coverage from its active RIS capability and self-sustainability from energy harvesting (EH). We investigate the architecture of multi-MF-RISs to assist non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) downlink networks. We formulate an energy efficiency (EE) maximization problem by optimizing power allocation, transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations of amplitudes, phase-shifts and EH ratios, as well as the position of MF-RISs, while satisfying constraints of available power, user rate requirements, and self-sustainability property. We design a parametrized sharing scheme for multi-agent hybrid deep reinforcement learning (PMHRL), where the multi-agent proximal policy optimization (PPO) and deep-Q network (DQN) handle continuous and discrete variables, respectively. The simulation results have demonstrated that proposed PMHRL has the highest EE compared to other benchmarks, including cases without parametrized sharing, pure PPO and DQN. Moreover, the proposed multi-MF-RISs-aided downlink NOMA achieves the highest EE compared to scenarios of no-EH/amplification, traditional RISs, and deployment without RISs/MF-RISs under different multiple access.

Title: Optimal Transport-Based Decentralized Multi-Agent Distribution Matching
Authors: Kooktae Lee
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized control framework for distribution matching in multi-agent systems (MAS), where agents collectively achieve a prescribed terminal spatial distribution. The problem is formulated using optimal transport (Wasserstein distance), which provides a principled measure of distributional discrepancy and serves as the basis for the control design. To avoid solving the global optimal transport problem directly, the distribution-matching objective is reformulated into a tractable per-agent decision process, enabling each agent to identify its desired terminal locations using only locally available information. A sequential weight-update rule is introduced to construct feasible local transport plans, and a memory-based correction mechanism is incorporated to maintain reliable operation under intermittent and range-limited communication. Convergence guarantees are established, showing cycle-wise improvement of a surrogate transport cost under both linear and nonlinear agent dynamics. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves effective and scalable distribution matching while operating fully in a decentralized manner.

Title: Fractional Programming for Kullback-Leibler Divergence in Hypothesis Testing
Authors: Jeongwoo Park, Seongkyu Jung, Kaiming Shen, Jeonghun Park
Abstract: Maximizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) is a fundamental problem in waveform design for active sensing and hypothesis testing, as it directly relates to the error exponent of detection probability. However, the associated optimization problem is highly nonconvex due to the intricate coupling of log-determinant and matrix trace terms. Existing solutions often suffer from high computational complexity, typically requiring matrix inversion at every iteration. In this paper, we propose a computationally efficient optimization framework based on fractional programming (FP). Our key idea is to reformulate the KLD maximization problem into a sequence of tractable quadratic subproblems using matrix FP. To further reduce complexity, we introduce a nonhomogeneous relaxation technique that replaces the costly linear system solver with a simple closed-form update, thereby reducing the per-iteration complexity to quadratic order. To compensate for the convergence speed trade-off caused by relaxation, we employ an acceleration method called STEM by interpreting the iterative scheme as a fixed-point mapping. The resulting algorithm achieves significantly faster convergence rates with low per-iteration cost. Numerical results demonstrate that our approach reduces the total runtime by orders of magnitude compared to a state-of-the-art benchmark. Finally, we apply the proposed framework to a multiple random access scenario and a joint integrated sensing and communication scenario, validating the efficacy of our framework in such applications.

Title: Stability Verification for Switched Systems using Neural Multiple Lyapunov Functions
Authors: Junyue Huang, Shaoyuan Li, Xiang Yin
Abstract: Stability analysis of switched systems, characterized by multiple operational modes and switching signals, is challenging due to their nonlinear dynamics. While frameworks such as multiple Lyapunov functions (MLF) provide a foundation for analysis, their computational applicability is limited for systems without favorable structure. This paper investigates stability analysis for switched systems under state-dependent switching conditions. We propose neural multiple Lyapunov functions (NMLF), a unified framework that combines the theoretical guarantees of MLF with the computational efficiency of neural Lyapunov functions (NLF). Our approach leverages a set of tailored loss functions and a counter-example guided inductive synthesis (CEGIS) scheme to train neural networks that rigorously satisfy MLF conditions. Through comprehensive simulations and theoretical analysis, we demonstrate NMLF's effectiveness and its potential for practical deployment in complex switched systems.

Title: WiFo-MUD: Wireless Foundation Model for Heterogeneous Multi-User Demodulator
Authors: Zonghui Yang, Shijian Gao, Xuesong Cai, Xiang Cheng, Liuqing Yang
Abstract: Multi-user signal demodulation is critical to wireless communications, directly impacting transmission reliability and efficiency. However, existing demodulators underperform in generic multi-user environments: classical demodulators struggle to balance accuracy and complexity, while deep learning-based methods lack adaptability under heterogeneous configurations. Although diffusion models have been introduced for demodulation, their flexibility remains limited for practical use. To address these issues, this work proposes WiFo-MUD, a universal diffusion-based foundation model for multi-user demodulation. The model aligns inter-user signal-to-noise ratio imbalance and performs conditional denoising via a customized backbone. Furthermore, a communication-aware consistency distillation method and a dynamic user-grouping strategy are devised to enhance inference. WiFo-MUD achieves state-of-the-art results on large-scale heterogeneous datasets, demonstrating efficient inference and strong generalization across varying system configurations.

Title: Splitting Precoding with Subspace Selection and Quantized Refinement for Massive MIMO
Authors: Yasaman Khorsandmanesh, Emil Bjornson, Joakim Jalden
Abstract: Limited fronthaul capacity is a practical bottleneck in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) 5G architectures, where a base station (BS) consists of an advanced antenna system (AAS) connected to a baseband unit (BBU). Conventional downlink designs place the entire precoding computation at the BBU and transmit a high-dimensional precoding matrix over the fronthaul, resulting in substantial quantization losses and signaling overhead. This letter proposes a splitting precoding architecture that separates the design between the AAS and BBU. The AAS performs a local subspace selection to reduce the channel dimensionality, while the BBU computes an optimized quantized refinement precoding based on the resulting effective channel. The numerical results show that the proposed splitting precoding strategy achieves higher sum spectral efficiency than conventional one-stage precoding.

Title: Physics-Guided Dual-Domain Plug-and-Play ADMM for Low-Dose CT Reconstruction
Authors: Sayantan Dutta, Sudhanya Chatterjee, Ashwini Galande, K. S. Shriram, Bipul Das
Abstract: Ultra-low-dose CT (ULDCT) imaging can greatly reduce patient radiation exposure, but the resulting scans suffer from severe structured and random noise that degrades image quality. To address this challenge, we propose a novel Plug-and-Play model-based iterative reconstruction framework (PnP-MBIR) that integrates a deep convolutional denoiser trained in a 2-stage self-supervised Noise-to-Noise (N2N) scheme. The method alternates between enforcing sinogram-domain data fidelity and applying the learned image-domain denoiser within an optimization, enabling artifact suppression while maintaining anatomical structure. The 2-stage protocol enables fully self-supervised training from noisy data, followed by high-dose fine-tuning, ensuring the denoiser's robustness in the ultra-low-dose regime. Our method enables high-quality reconstructions at $\sim$70--80\% lower dose levels, while maintaining diagnostic fidelity comparable to standard full-dose scans. Quantitative evaluations using Gray-Level Co-occurrence Matrix (GLCM) features -- including contrast, homogeneity, entropy, and correlation -- confirm that the proposed method yields superior texture consistency and detail preservation over standalone deep learning and supervised PnP baselines. Qualitative and quantitative results on both simulated and clinical datasets demonstrate that our framework effectively reduces streaks and structured artifacts while preserving subtle tissue contrast, making it a promising tool for ULDCT reconstruction.

Title: KDPhys: An Attention Guided 3D to 2D Knowledge Distillation for Real-time Video-Based Physiological Measurement
Authors: Nicky Nirlipta Sahoo, VS Sachidanand, Matcha Naga Gayathri, Balamurali Murugesan, Keerthi Ram, Jayaraj Joseph, Mohanasankar Sivaprakasam
Abstract: Camera-based physiological monitoring, such as remote photoplethysmography (rPPG), captures subtle variations in skin optical properties caused by pulsatile blood volume changes using standard digital camera sensors. The demand for real-time, non-contact physiological measurement has increased significantly, particularly during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, to support telehealth and remote health monitoring applications. In this work, we propose an attention-based knowledge distillation (KD) framework, termed KDPhys, for extracting rPPG signals from facial video sequences. The proposed method distills global temporal representations from a 3D convolutional neural network (CNN) teacher model to a lightweight 2D CNN student model through effective 3D-to-2D feature distillation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first application of knowledge distillation in the rPPG domain. Furthermore, we introduce a Distortion Loss incorporating Shape and Time (DILATE), which jointly accounts for both morphological and temporal characteristics of rPPG signals. Extensive qualitative and quantitative evaluations are conducted on three benchmark datasets. The proposed model achieves a significant reduction in computational complexity, using only half the parameters of existing methods while operating 56.67% faster. With just 0.23M parameters, it achieves an 18.15% reduction in Mean Absolute Error (MAE) compared to state-of-the-art approaches, attaining an average MAE of 1.78 bpm across all datasets. Additional experiments under diverse environmental conditions and activity scenarios further demonstrate the robustness and adaptability of the proposed approach.

Title: Conformal Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces: A Cylindrical Geometry Perspective
Authors: Filippo Pepe, Ivan Iudice, Giuseppe Castaldi, Marco Di Renzo, Vincenzo Galdi
Abstract: Curved reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) represent a promising frontier for next-generation wireless communication, enabling adaptive wavefront control on nonplanar platforms such as unmanned aerial vehicles and urban infrastructure. This work presents a systematic investigation of cylindrical RISs, progressing from idealized surface-impedance synthesis to practical implementations based on simple one-bit meta-atoms. Exact analytical and geometrical-optics-based models are first developed to explore fundamental design limits, followed by a semi-analytical formulation tailored to discrete, reconfigurable architectures. This model enables efficient beam synthesis using both evolutionary optimization and low-complexity strategies, including the minimum power distortionless response method, and is validated through full-wave simulations. Results confirm that one-bit RISs can achieve directive scattering with manageable sidelobe levels and minimal hardware complexity. These findings establish the viability of cylindrical RISs and open the door to their integration into dual-use wireless platforms for real-world communication scenarios.

Abstract: Classic problem-space theory models problem solving as a navigation through a structured space of states, operators, goals, and constraints. Systems Engineering (SE) employs analogous constructs (functional analysis, operational analysis, scenarios, trade studies), yet still lacks a rigorous systems-theoretic representation of the problem space itself. In current practice, reasoning often proceeds directly from stakeholder goals to prescriptive artifacts. This makes foundational assumptions about the operational environment, admissible interactions, and contextual conditions implicit or prematurely embedded in architectures or requirements. This paper addresses that gap by formalizing the problem space as an explicit semantic world model containing theoretical constructs that are defined prior to requirements and solution commitments. These constructs along with the developed axioms, theorems and corollary establish a rigorous criterion for unambiguous boundary semantics, context-dependent interaction traceability to successful stakeholder goal satisfaction, and sufficiency of problem-space specification over which disciplined reasoning can occur independent of solution design. It offers a clear distinction between what is true of the problem domain and what is chosen as a solution. The paper concludes by discussing the significance of the theory on practitioners and provides a dialogue-based hypothetical case study between a stakeholder and an engineer, demonstrating how the theory guides problem framing before designing any prescriptive artifacts.

Title: Energy Efficiency Maximization of MIMO Systems through Reconfigurable Holographic Beamforming
Authors: Robert Kuku Fotock, Alessio Zappone, Agbotiname Lucky Imoize, Marco Di Renzo
Abstract: This study considers a point-to-point wireless link, in which both the transmitter and receiver are equipped with multiple antennas. In addition, two reconfigurable metasurfaces are deployed, one in the immediate vicinity of the transmit antenna array, and one in the immediate vicinity of the receive antenna array. The resulting architecture implements a holographic beamforming structure at both the transmitter and receiver. In this scenario, the system energy efficiency is optimized with respect to the transmit covariance matrix, and the reflection matrices of the two metasurfaces. A low-complexity algorithm is developed, which is guaranteed to converge to a first-order optimal point of the energy efficiency maximization problem. Moreover, closed-form expressions are derived for the metasurface matrices in the special case of single-antenna or single-stream transmission. The two metasurfaces are considered to be nearly-passive and subject to global reflection constraints. A numerical performance analysis is conducted to assess the performance of the proposed optimization methods, showing, in particular, that the use of holographic beamforming by metasurfaces can provide significant energy efficiency gains compared to fully digital beamforming architectures, even when the latter achieve substantial multiplexing gains.

Title: IKFST: IOO and KOO Algorithms for Accelerated and Precise WFST-based End-to-End Automatic Speech Recognition
Authors: Zhuoran Zhuang, Ye Chen, Chao Luo, Tian-Hao Zhang, Xuewei Zhang, Jian Ma, Jiatong Shi, Wei Zhang
Abstract: End-to-end automatic speech recognition has become the dominant paradigm in both academia and industry. To enhance recognition performance, the Weighted Finite-State Transducer (WFST) is widely adopted to integrate acoustic and language models through static graph composition, providing robust decoding and effective error correction. However, WFST decoding relies on a frame-by-frame autoregressive search over CTC posterior probabilities, which severely limits inference efficiency. Motivated by establishing a more principled compatibility between WFST decoding and CTC modeling, we systematically study the two fundamental components of CTC outputs, namely blank and non-blank frames, and identify a key insight: blank frames primarily encode positional information, while non-blank frames carry semantic content. Building on this observation, we introduce Keep-Only-One and Insert-Only-One, two decoding algorithms that explicitly exploit the structural roles of blank and non-blank frames to achieve significantly faster WFST-based inference without compromising recognition accuracy. Experiments on large-scale in-house, AISHELL-1, and LibriSpeech datasets demonstrate state-of-the-art recognition accuracy with substantially reduced decoding latency, enabling truly efficient and high-performance WFST decoding in modern speech recognition systems.

Title: Latent Flow Matching for Expressive Singing Voice Synthesis
Authors: Minhyeok Yun, Yong-Hoon Choi
Abstract: Conditional variational autoencoder (cVAE)-based singing voice synthesis provides efficient inference and strong audio quality by learning a score-conditioned prior and a recording-conditioned posterior latent space. However, because synthesis relies on prior samples while training uses posterior latents inferred from real recordings, imperfect distribution matching can cause a prior-posterior mismatch that degrades fine-grained expressiveness such as vibrato and micro-prosody. We propose FM-Singer, which introduces conditional flow matching (CFM) in latent space to learn a continuous vector field transporting prior latents toward posterior latents along an optimal-transport-inspired path. At inference time, the learned latent flow refines a prior sample by solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE) before waveform generation, improving expressiveness while preserving the efficiency of parallel decoding. Experiments on Korean and Chinese singing datasets demonstrate consistent improvements over strong baselines, including lower mel-cepstral distortion and fundamental-frequency error and higher perceptual scores on the Korean dataset.

Title: Evolution of UE in Massive MIMO Systems for 6G: From Passive to Active
Authors: Kwonyeol Park, Hyuckjin Choi, Geonho Han, Gyoseung Lee, Yeonjoon Choi, Sunwoo Park, Junil Choi
Abstract: As wireless networks continue to evolve, stringent latency and reliability requirements and highly dynamic channels expose fundamental limitations of gNB-centric massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) architectures, motivating a rethinking of the user equipment (UE) role. In response, the UE is transitioning from a passive transceiver into an active entity that directly contributes to system-level performance. In this context, this article examines the evolving role of the UE in mMIMO systems during the transition from fifth-generation (5G) to sixth-generation (6G), bridging third generation partnership project (3GPP) standardization, device implementation, and architectural innovation. Through a chronological review of 3GPP Releases 15 to 19, we highlight the progression of UE functionalities from basic channel state information (CSI) reporting to artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML)-based CSI enhancement and UE-initiated beam management. We further examine key implementation challenges, including multi-panel UE (MPUE) architectures, on-device intelligent processing, and energy-efficient operation, and then discuss corresponding architectural innovations under practical constraints. Using digital-twin-based evaluations, we validate the impact of emerging UE-centric functionalities, illustrating that UE-initiated beam reporting improves throughput in realistic mobility scenarios, while a multi-panel architecture enhances link robustness compared with a single-panel UE.

Title: Can Optimal Transport Improve Federated Inverse Reinforcement Learning?
Authors: David Millard, Ali Baheri
Abstract: In robotics and multi-agent systems, fleets of autonomous agents often operate in subtly different environments while pursuing a common high-level objective. Directly pooling their data to learn a shared reward function is typically impractical due to differences in dynamics, privacy constraints, and limited communication bandwidth. This paper introduces an optimal transport-based approach to federated inverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Each client first performs lightweight Maximum Entropy IRL locally, adhering to its computational and privacy limitations. The resulting reward functions are then fused via a Wasserstein barycenter, which considers their underlying geometric structure. We further prove that this barycentric fusion yields a more faithful global reward estimate than conventional parameter averaging methods in federated learning. Overall, this work provides a principled and communication-efficient framework for deriving a shared reward that generalizes across heterogeneous agents and environments.

Title: MR-DAW: Towards Collaborative Digital Audio Workstations in Mixed Reality
Authors: Torin Hopkins, Shih-Yu Ma, Suibi Che-Chuan Weng, Ming-Yuan Pai, Ellen Yi-Luen Do, Luca Turchet
Abstract: Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) are central to modern music production but often encumber the musician's workflow, tethering them to a desk and hindering natural interaction with their instrument. Furthermore, effective remote collaboration remains a significant challenge, with existing solutions hampered by network latency and asynchronous file sharing. This paper investigates the potential of Mixed Reality (MR) to overcome these barriers, creating an intuitive environment for real-time, remote musical collaboration. We employ qualitative and speculative design techniques to better understand: 1) how players currently use DAWs, and 2) to imagine a speculative future of collaborative MR-DAWs. To facilitate this discussion, we developed and evaluated the usability of a design probe, MR-DAW. An MR system enabling multiple, geographically dispersed users to control a single, shared DAW instance while moving freely in their local spaces. Our networked system enables each remote musician to use a physical foot pedal for collaborative looping, merging a familiar, hands-free interaction with a shared virtual session. Based on interviews and system evaluations with 20 musicians, we analyze current practices, report on the user experience with our MR system, and speculate on the future of musical collaboration in MR. Our results highlight the affordances of MR for unencumbered musical interaction and provide a speculative outlook on the future of remote collaborative DAWs in the Musical Metaverse.

Title: Semantic Transmission Framework in Direct Satellite Communications
Authors: Chong Huang, Xuyang Chen, Jingfu Li, Pei Xiao, Gaojie Chen, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Insufficient link budget has become a bottleneck problem for direct access in current satellite communications. In this paper, we develop a semantic transmission framework for direct satellite communications as an effective and viable solution to tackle this problem. To measure the tradeoffs between communication, computation, and generation quality, we introduce a semantic efficiency metric with optimized weights. The optimization aims to maximize the average semantic efficiency metric by jointly optimizing transmission mode selection, satellite-user association, ISL task migration, denoising steps, and adaptive weights, which is a complex nonlinear integer programming problem. To maximize the average semantic efficiency metric, we propose a decision-assisted REINFORCE++ algorithm that utilizes feasibility-aware action space and a critic-free stabilized policy update. Numerical results show that the proposed algorithm achieves higher semantic efficiency than baselines.

Title: Detecting Spike Wave Discharges (SWD) using 1-dimensional Residual UNet
Authors: Saurav Sengupta, Scott Kilianski, Suchetha Sharma, Sakina Lashkeri, Ashley McHugh, Mark Beenhakker, Donald E. Brown
Abstract: The manual labeling of events in electroencephalography (EEG) records is time-consuming. This is especially true when EEG recordings are taken continuously over weeks to months. Therefore, a method to automatically label pertinent EEG events reduces the manual workload. Spike wave discharges (SWD), which are the electrographic hallmark of absence seizures, are EEG events that are often labeled manually. While some previous studies have utilized machine learning to automatically segment and classify EEG signals like SWDs, they can be improved. Here we compare the performance of 14 machine learning classifiers on our own manually annotated dataset of 961 hours of EEG recordings from C3H/HeJ mice, including 22,637 labeled SWDs. We find that a 1D UNet performs best for labeling SWDs in this dataset. We also improve the 1D UNet by augmenting our training data and determine that scaling showed the greatest benefit of all augmentation procedures applied. We then compare the 1D UNet with data augmentation, AugUNet1D, against a recently published time- and frequency-based algorithmic approach called "Twin Peaks". AugUNet1D showed superior performance and detected events with more similar features to the SWDs labeled manually. AugUNet1D, pretrained on our manually annotated data or untrained, is made public for others users.

Authors: Trung Dao, Minh Nguyen, Son Do, Hoang Tran
Abstract: The rapid proliferation of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies, projected to exceed 30 billion interconnected devices by 2030, has significantly escalated the complexity of cybersecurity challenges. This survey aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of vulnerabilities, threats, and defense mechanisms, specifically focusing on the integration of network and application layers within real-time monitoring and decision-making systems. Employing an integrative review methodology, 59 scholarly articles published between 2009 and 2024 were selected from databases such as IEEE Xplore, ScienceDirect, and PubMed, utilizing keywords related to IoT vulnerabilities and security attacks. Key findings identify critical threat categories, including sensor vulnerabilities, Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks, and public cloud insecurity. Conversely, the study highlights advanced defense approaches leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) for anomaly detection, Blockchain for decentralized trust, and Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) for continuous verification. This paper contributes a novel five-layer IoT model and outlines future research directions involving quantum computing and 6G networks to bolster IoT ecosystem resilience.

Title: A Language-Agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE Architecture for CTC-based Multilingual ASR
Authors: Yuang Zheng, Yuxiang Mei, Dongxing Xu, Jie Chen, Yanhua Long
Abstract: Large-scale multilingual ASR (mASR) models such as Whisper achieve strong performance but incur high computational and latency costs, limiting their deployment on resource-constrained edge devices. In this study, we propose a lightweight and language-agnostic multilingual ASR system based on a CTC architecture with domain adaptation. Specifically, we introduce a Language-agnostic Hierarchical LoRA-MoE (HLoRA) framework integrated into an mHuBERT-CTC model, enabling end-to-end decoding via LID-posterior-driven LoRA routing. The hierarchical design consists of a multilingual shared LoRA for learning language-invariant acoustic representations and language-specific LoRA experts for modeling language-dependent characteristics. The proposed routing mechanism removes the need for prior language identity information or explicit language labels during inference, achieving true language-agnostic decoding. Experiments on MSR-86K and the MLC-SLM 2025 Challenge datasets demonstrate that HLoRA achieves competitive performance with state-of-the-art two-stage inference methods using only single-pass decoding, significantly improving decoding efficiency for low-resource mASR applications.

Title: NMPC-Augmented Visual Navigation and Safe Learning Control for Large-Scale Mobile Robots
Authors: Mehdi Heydari Shahna, Pauli Mustalahti, Jouni Mattila
Abstract: A large-scale mobile robot (LSMR) is a high-order multibody system that often operates on loose, unconsolidated terrain, which reduces traction. This paper presents a comprehensive navigation and control framework for an LSMR that ensures stability and safety-defined performance, delivering robust operation on slip-prone terrain by jointly leveraging high-performance techniques. The proposed architecture comprises four main modules: (1) a visual pose-estimation module that fuses onboard sensors and stereo cameras to provide an accurate, low-latency robot pose, (2) a high-level nonlinear model predictive control that updates the wheel motion commands to correct robot drift from the robot reference pose on slip-prone terrain, (3) a low-level deep neural network control policy that approximates the complex behavior of the wheel-driven actuation mechanism in LSMRs, augmented with robust adaptive control to handle out-of-distribution disturbances, ensuring that the wheels accurately track the updated commands issued by high-level control module, and (4) a logarithmic safety module to monitor the entire robot stack and guarantees safe operation. The proposed low-level control framework guarantees uniform exponential stability of the actuation subsystem, while the safety module ensures the whole system-level safety during operation. Comparative experiments on a 6,000 kg LSMR actuated by two complex electro-hydrostatic drives, while synchronizing modules operating at different frequencies.

Title: From 2D to 3D terrain-following area coverage path planning
Authors: Mogens Plessen
Abstract: An algorithm for 3D terrain-following area coverage path planning is presented. Multiple adjacent paths are generated that are (i) locally apart from each other by a distance equal to the working width of a machinery, while (ii) simultaneously floating at a projection distance equal to a specific working height above the terrain. The complexities of the algorithm in comparison to its 2D equivalent are highlighted. These include uniformly spaced elevation data generation using an Inverse Distance Weighting-approach and a local search. Area coverage path planning results for real-world 3D data within an agricultural context are presented to validate the algorithm.

Title: ARISE: Adaptive Reinforcement Integrated with Swarm Exploration
Authors: Rajiv Chaitanya M, D R Ramesh Babu
Abstract: Effective exploration remains a key challenge in RL, especially with non-stationary rewards or high-dimensional policies. We introduce ARISE, a lightweight framework that enhances reinforcement learning by augmenting standard policy-gradient methods with a compact swarm-based exploration layer. ARISE blends policy actions with particle-driven proposals, where each particle represents a candidate policy trajectory sampled in the action space, and modulates exploration adaptively using reward-variance cues. While easy benchmarks exhibit only slight improvements (e.g., +0.7% on CartPole-v1), ARISE yields substantial gains on more challenging tasks, including +46% on LunarLander-v3 and +22% on Hopper-v4, while preserving stability on Walker2d and Ant. Under non-stationary reward shifts, ARISE provides marked robustness advantages, outperforming PPO by +75 points on CartPole and improving LunarLander accordingly. Ablation studies confirm that both the swarm component and the adaptive mechanism contribute to the performance. Overall, ARISE offers a simple, architecture-agnostic route to more exploratory and resilient RL agents without altering core algorithmic structures.

Title: Stochastic Actor-Critic: Mitigating Overestimation via Temporal Aleatoric Uncertainty
Authors: Uğurcan Özalp
Abstract: Off-policy actor-critic methods in reinforcement learning train a critic with temporal-difference updates and use it as a learning signal for the policy (actor). This design typically achieves higher sample efficiency than purely on-policy methods. However, critic networks tend to overestimate value estimates systematically. This is often addressed by introducing a pessimistic bias based on uncertainty estimates. Current methods employ ensembling to quantify the critic's epistemic uncertainty-uncertainty due to limited data and model ambiguity-to scale pessimistic updates. In this work, we propose a new algorithm called Stochastic Actor-Critic (STAC) that incorporates temporal (one-step) aleatoric uncertainty-uncertainty arising from stochastic transitions, rewards, and policy-induced variability in Bellman targets-to scale pessimistic bias in temporal-difference updates, rather than relying on epistemic uncertainty. STAC uses a single distributional critic network to model the temporal return uncertainty, and applies dropout to both the critic and actor networks for regularization. Our results show that pessimism based on a distributional critic alone suffices to mitigate overestimation, and naturally leads to risk-averse behavior in stochastic environments. Introducing dropout further improves training stability and performance by means of regularization. With this design, STAC achieves improved computational efficiency using a single distributional critic network.

Title: Real-Time Forecasting of Pathological Gait via IMU Navigation: A Few-Shot and Generative Learning Framework for Wearable Devices
Authors: Wenwen Zhang, Hao Zhang, Zenan Jiang, Amir Servati, Peyman Servati
Abstract: Current gait analysis faces challenges in various aspects, including limited and poorly labeled data within existing wearable electronics databases, difficulties in collecting patient data due to privacy concerns, and the inadequacy of the Zero-Velocity Update Technique (ZUPT) in accurately analyzing pathological gait patterns. To address these limitations, we introduce GaitMotion, a novel machine-learning framework that employs few-shot learning on a multitask dataset collected via wearable IMU sensors for real-time pathological gait analysis. GaitMotion enhances data quality through detailed, ground-truth-labeled sequences and achieves accurate step and stride segmentation and stride length estimation, which are essential for diagnosing neurological disorders. We incorporate a generative augmentation component, which synthesizes rare or underrepresented pathological gait patterns. GaitMotion achieves a 65\% increase in stride length estimation accuracy compared to ZUPT. In addition, its application to real patient datasets via transfer learning confirms its robust predictive capability. By integrating generative AI into wearable gait analysis, GaitMotion not only refines the precision of pathological gait forecasting but also demonstrates a scalable framework for leveraging synthetic data in biomechanical pattern recognition, paving the way for more personalized and data-efficient digital health services.

Title: CIC: Circular Image Compression
Authors: Honggui Li, Sinan Chen, Dingtai Li, Zhengyang Zhang, Nahid Md Lokman Hossain, Xinfeng Xu, Yinlu Qin, Ruobing Wang, Maria Trocan, Dimitri Galayko, Amara Amara, Mohamad Sawan
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) is currently the cutting-edge method. However, the inherent difference between testing and training images of LIC results in performance degradation to some extent. Especially for out-of-sample, out-of-distribution, or out-of-domain testing images, the performance of LIC degrades significantly. Classical LIC is a serial image compression (SIC) approach that utilizes an open-loop architecture with serial encoding and decoding units. Nevertheless, according to the principles of automatic control systems, a closed-loop architecture holds the potential to improve the dynamic and static performance of LIC. Therefore, a circular image compression (CIC) approach with closed-loop encoding and decoding elements is proposed to minimize the gap between testing and training images and upgrade the capability of LIC. The proposed CIC establishes a nonlinear loop equation and proves that steady-state error between reconstructed and original images is close to zero by Taylor series expansion. The proposed CIC method possesses the property of Post-Training and Plug-and-Play which can be built on any existing advanced SIC methods. Experimental results including rate-distortion curves on five public image compression datasets demonstrate that the proposed CIC outperforms eight competing state-of-the-art open-source SIC algorithms in reconstruction capacity. Experimental results further show that the proposed method is suitable for out-of-sample testing images with dark backgrounds, sharp edges, high contrast, grid shapes, or complex patterns.

Title: UKAN-EP: Enhancing U-KAN with Efficient Attention and Pyramid Aggregation for 3D Multi-Modal MRI Brain Tumor Segmentation
Authors: Yanbing Chen, Tianze Tang, Taehyo Kim, Hai Shu
Abstract: Background: Gliomas are among the most common malignant brain tumors and exhibit substantial heterogeneity, complicating accurate detection and segmentation. Although multi-modal MRI is the clinical standard for glioma imaging, variability across modalities and high computational demands hamper effective automated segmentation. Methods: We propose UKAN-EP, a novel 3D extension of the original 2D U-KAN model for multi-modal MRI brain tumor segmentation. While U-KAN integrates Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) layers into a U-Net backbone, UKAN-EP further incorporates Efficient Channel Attention (ECA) and Pyramid Feature Aggregation (PFA) modules to enhance inter-modality feature fusion and multi-scale feature representation. We also introduce a dynamic loss weighting strategy that adaptively balances cross-entropy and Dice losses during training. Results: On the 2024 BraTS-GLI dataset, UKAN-EP achieves superior segmentation performance (e.g., Dice = 0.9001 $\pm$ 0.0127 and IoU = 0.8257 $\pm$ 0.0186 for the whole tumor) while requiring substantially fewer computational resources (223.57 GFLOPs and 11.30M parameters) compared to strong baselines including U-Net, Attention U-Net, Swin UNETR, VT-Unet, TransBTS, and 3D U-KAN. An extensive ablation study further confirms the effectiveness of ECA and PFA and shows the limited utility of self-attention and spatial attention alternatives. Conclusion: UKAN-EP demonstrates that combining the expressive power of KAN layers with lightweight channel-wise attention and multi-scale feature aggregation improves the accuracy and efficiency of brain tumor segmentation.

Title: Tannenbaum's gain-margin optimization meets Polyak's heavy-ball algorithm
Authors: Wuwei Wu, Jie Chen, Mihailo R. Jovanović, Tryphon T. Georgiou
Abstract: This paper highlights an apparent, yet relatively unknown link between algorithm design in optimization theory and controller synthesis in robust control. Specifically, quadratic optimization can be recast as a regulation problem within the framework of $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control. From this vantage point, the optimality of Polyak's fastest heavy-ball algorithm can be ascertained as a solution to a gain margin optimization problem. The approach is independent of Polyak's original and brilliant argument, and relies on foundational work by Tannenbaum, who introduced and solved gain margin optimization via Nevanlinna--Pick interpolation theory. The link between first-order optimization methods and robust control sheds new light on the limits of algorithmic performance of such methods, and suggests a framework where similar computational tasks can be systematically studied and algorithms optimized. In particular, it raises the question as to whether periodically scheduled algorithms can achieve faster rates for quadratic optimization, in a manner analogous to periodic control that extends the gain margin beyond that of time-invariant control. This turns out not to be the case, due to the analytic obstruction of a transmission zero that is inherent in causal schemes. Interestingly, this obstruction can be removed with implicit algorithms, cast as feedback regulation problems with causal, but not strictly causal dynamics, thereby devoid of the transmission zero at infinity and able to achieve superior convergence rates.

Title: Scan-Adaptive MRI Undersampling Using Neighbor-based Optimization (SUNO)
Authors: Siddhant Gautam, Angqi Li, Nicole Seiberlich, Jeffrey A. Fessler, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Accelerated MRI involves collecting partial $k$-space measurements to reduce acquisition time, patient discomfort, and motion artifacts, and typically uses regular undersampling patterns or human-designed schemes. Recent works have studied population-adaptive sampling patterns learned from a group of patients (or scans). However, such patterns can be sub-optimal for individual scans, as they may fail to capture scan or slice-specific details, and their effectiveness can depend on the size and composition of the population. To overcome this issue, we propose a framework for jointly learning scan-adaptive Cartesian undersampling patterns and a corresponding reconstruction model from a training set. We use an alternating algorithm for learning the sampling patterns and the reconstruction model where we use an iterative coordinate descent (ICD) based offline optimization of scan-adaptive $k$-space sampling patterns for each example in the training set. A nearest neighbor search is then used to select the scan-adaptive sampling pattern at test time from initially acquired low-frequency $k$-space information. We applied the proposed framework (dubbed SUNO) to the fastMRI multi-coil knee and brain datasets, demonstrating improved performance over the currently used undersampling patterns at both $4\times$ and $8\times$ acceleration factors in terms of both visual quality and quantitative metrics. The code for the proposed framework is available at this https URL.

Title: Sampled-data Systems: Stability, Contractivity and Single-iteration Suboptimal MPC
Authors: Yiting Chen, Francesco Bullo, Emiliano Dall'Anese
Abstract: This paper analyzes the stability of interconnected continuous-time (CT) and discrete-time (DT) systems coupled through sampling and zero-order hold mechanisms. The DT system updates its output at regular intervals $T>0$ by applying an $n$-fold composition of a given map. This setup is motivated by online and sampled-data implementations of optimization-based controllers - particularly model predictive control (MPC) - where the DT system models $n$ iterations of an algorithm approximating the solution of an optimization problem. We introduce the concept of a reduced model, defined as the limiting behavior of the sampled-data system as $T \to 0^+$ and $n \to +\infty$. Our main theoretical contribution establishes that when the reduced model is contractive, there exists a threshold duration $T(n)$ for each iteration count $n$ such that the CT-DT interconnection achieves exponential stability for all sampling periods $T < T(n)$. Finally, under the stronger condition that both the CT and DT systems are contractive, we show exponential stability of their interconnection using a small-gain argument. Our theoretical results provide new insights into suboptimal MPC stability, showing that convergence guarantees hold even when using a single iteration of the optimization algorithm - a practically significant finding for real-time control applications.

Title: Machine Learning based Radio Environment Map Estimation for Indoor Visible Light Communication
Authors: Helena Serpi, Christina (Tanya)Politi
Abstract: Novel radio map estimation in optical wireless communications is proposed based on ML prediction rather than simulation techniques. ML training is performed on simulation and experimentally generated synthetic data and in both cases, prediction is fast and of high accuracy. Among various models, Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) representation of indoor Visible Light Communication (VLC) systems outperforms the others with respect to RSS that is estimated for various indoor systems. The predicted RSS is very accurate and fast and requires a reduced set of training sample size with respect to other counterparts, making this solution very suitable for real time estimation of an indoor VLC system. It is shown that by tweaking MLP parameters, such as sample size, number of epochs and batch size, one can balance the desired level of inference accuracy with training time and optimize the model's performance to meet real-time requirements. Furthermore, experimental data from a PureLiFi system has been used in a proof-of-concept production of synthetic data radio map prediction based on MLP. Using SMOGN-generated synthetic data derived from fewer than 100 experimental measurements, our MLP model achieves strong regression performance on the experimental measurements, demonstrating successful synthetic-to-real generalization without direct training on the full experimental dataset.

Title: Affine Frequency Division Multiplexing (AFDM) for 6G: Properties, Features, and Challenges
Authors: Hyeon Seok Rou, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Vincent Savaux, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, David González G., Christos Masouros
Abstract: Affine frequency division multiplexing (AFDM) is an emerging waveform candidate for future sixth generation (6G) systems offering a range of promising features, such as enhanced robustness in heterogeneous and high-mobility environments, as well as inherent suitability for integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) applications. In addition, unlike other candidates such as orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulation, AFDM provides several unique advantages that strengthen its relevance to practical deployment and standardization in 6G. Notably, as a natural generalization of orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), strong backward compatibility with existing conventional systems is guaranteed, while also offering novel possibilities in waveform design, for example to enable physical-layer security through its inherent chirp parametrization. In all, this article provides an overview of AFDM, emphasizing its suitability as a candidate waveform for 6G standardization. First, we provide a concise introduction to the fundamental properties and unique characteristics of AFDM, followed by highlights of its advantageous features, and finally a discussion of its potential and challenges in 6G standardization efforts and representative requirements.

Title: KAN-Therm: A Lightweight Battery Thermal Model Using Kolmogorov-Arnold Network
Authors: Soumyoraj Mallick, Faysal Ahamed, Sanchita Ghosh, Tanushree Roy
Abstract: A battery management system (BMS) relies on real-time estimation of battery temperature distribution in battery cells to ensure safe and optimal operation of Lithium-ion batteries. However, physical BMS often suffers from memory and computational resource limitations required by high-fidelity models. Temperature estimation of batteries for safety-critical systems using physics-based models on physical BMS can potentially become challenging due to their higher computational time. In contrast, neural network based approaches offer faster estimation but require greater memory overhead. To address these challenges, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold network (KAN) based thermal model, KAN-therm, to estimate the core temperature of a cylindrical battery. Unlike traditional neural network architectures, KAN uses learnable nonlinear activation functions that can effectively capture system complexity using relatively lean models. We have compared the memory overhead and estimation time of our model with state-of-the-art neural network models to demonstrate the applicability and potential scalability of KAN-therm on a physical BMS.

Title: Quasi-Deterministic Modeling of Sub-THz Band Access Channels in Street Canyon Environments
Authors: Minseok Kim, Masato Yomoda, Minghe Mao, Nobuaki Kuno, Koshiro Kitao, Satoshi Suyama
Abstract: Sub-terahertz (sub-THz) frequencies (100--300 GHz) are expected to play a key role in beyond-5G and 6G mobile networks. However, their quasi-optical propagation characteristics require new channel models beyond sub-100 GHz extrapolations. This paper presents an extensive double-directional (D-D) channel measurement campaign conducted in an outdoor street-canyon environment at 154 GHz and 300 GHz under both line-of-sight (LoS) and non-line-of-sight (NLoS) conditions using an in-house-developed multi-tone frequency-domain channel sounder. Based on these measurements, clustering with merged datasets across the two frequencies enables comparative analyses that identify both common and distinct multipath clusters, as well as the frequency dependence of cluster-level characteristics. A quasi-deterministic (Q-D) channel model is then proposed, combining deterministic components, such as LoS and single-bounce reflections from side walls, with random components. Large-scale parameters (path loss, delay spread, angular spread, and Rician $K$-factor) are also evaluated. These results provide valuable insights into sub-THz propagation in urban street canyons and contribute toward the development of accurate, channel models for future 6G systems.

Title: RadarPLM: Adapting Pre-trained Language Models for Marine Radar Target Detection by Selective Fine-tuning
Authors: Qiying Hu, Yaowen Li, Xueqian Wang, Linping Zhang, Junlong Ke, Gang Li, Yu Liu, You He
Abstract: Recent advances in pre-trained language models (PLMs) have demonstrated their capabilities in capturing universal knowledge, making them promising for radar signal processing applications. Nevertheless, directly fine-tuning PLMs on radar signals is both computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, particularly in low signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR) environments. In this paper, we propose a novel fine-tuning framework for PLM-based marine radar target detection. First, we design a lightweight adaptation module, enabling computationally efficient fine-tuning while preserving the pre-trained model's general knowledge. Second, a novel preference-aware loss is developed to selectively optimize different feature patches based on their online-evaluated learning values, guiding the model to concentrate on those generalizable feature patterns during optimization. Finally, a binary classification head is retrained based on autoencoder network to further enhance detection performance. Experiments on real-world radar data show that the proposed RadarPLM framework yields at least a 6.35% improvement in detection performance over the existing networks under low SCR conditions. Especially, in small training samples cases,the proposed RadarPLM also achieves significant advantage over existing networks owing to the incorporation of the PLM.

Title: Parameter Training Efficiency Aware Resource Allocation for AIGC in Space-Air-Ground Integrated Networks
Authors: Liangxin Qian, Peiyuan Si, Jun Zhao, Kwok-Yan Lam
Abstract: With the evolution of artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) techniques and the development of space-air-ground integrated networks (SAGIN), there will be a growing opportunity to enhance more users' mobile experience with customized AIGC applications. This is made possible through the use of parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) training alongside mobile edge computing. In this paper, we formulate the optimization problem of maximizing the parameter training efficiency of the SAGIN system over wireless networks under limited resource constraints. We propose the Parameter training efficiency Aware Resource Allocation (PARA) technique to jointly optimize user association, data offloading, and communication and computational resource allocation. Solid proofs are presented to solve this difficult sum of ratios problem based on quadratically constrained quadratic programming (QCQP), semidefinite programming (SDP), graph theory, and fractional programming (FP) techniques. Our proposed PARA technique is effective in finding a stationary point of this non-convex problem. The simulation results demonstrate that the proposed PARA method outperforms other baselines.

Title: Dual-Scale Channel Estimation in Sensing-Assisted Communication Systems: Joint Time Allocation and Beamforming Design
Authors: Bai Zhiyue, Dai Minghui, Hou Fen, Shan hangguan, Cai X Lin, Shen (Sherman)Xuemin
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel integrated sensing and communication (ISAC)-enabled dual-scale channel estimation framework, where large-scale channel estimation benefits from sensing, and the temporal variation of small-scale channel state information is modeled via channel aging. By characterizing the impact of angular sensing error on the communication spatial correlation matrix, we derive a closed form expression for the achievable rate under dual-scale channel estimation errors. Considering the different characteristics in time scales, we design the sensing duration for slow-varying large-scale channel and determine the update timing and frequency for fast-varying small-scale channel information within a given frame structure. We formulate an average achievable rate maximization problem under limited time resources and sensing Cramer-Rao bound (CRB) constraints, and propose a segmented golden based joint optimization algorithm to efficiently solve this nonconvex problem. Simulation results demonstrate that our proposed scheme achieves significant performance improvement compared with the benchmark schemes, which further validate that the system can leverage additional sensing capabilities to enhance communication efficiency.

Title: HiSin: A Sinogram-Aware Framework for Efficient High-Resolution Inpainting
Authors: Jiaze E, Srutarshi Banerjee, Tekin Bicer, Guannan Wang, Yanfu Zhang, Bin Ren
Abstract: High-resolution sinogram inpainting is essential for computed tomography reconstruction, as missing high-frequency projections can lead to visible artifacts and diagnostic errors. Diffusion models are well-suited for this task due to their robustness and detail-preserving capabilities, but their application to high-resolution inputs is limited by excessive memory and computational demands. To address this limitation, we propose HiSin, a novel diffusion-based framework for efficient sinogram inpainting that exploits spectral sparsity and structural heterogeneity of projection data. It progressively extracts global structure at low resolution and defers high-resolution inference to small patches, enabling memory-efficient inpainting. Considering the structural features of sinograms, we incorporate frequency-aware patch skipping and structure-adaptive step allocation to reduce redundant computation. Experimental results show that HiSin reduces peak memory usage by up to 30.81% and inference time by up to 17.58% than the state-of-the-art framework, and maintains inpainting accuracy across.

Title: Hybrid A* Path Planning with Multi-Modal Motion Extension for Four-Wheel Steering Mobile Robots
Authors: Runjiao Bao, Lin Zhang, Tianwei Niu, Haoyu Yuan, Shoukun Wang
Abstract: Four-wheel independent steering (4WIS) systems provide mobile robots with a rich set of motion modes, such as Ackermann steering, lateral steering, and parallel movement, offering superior maneuverability in constrained environments. However, existing path planning methods generally assume a single kinematic model and thus fail to fully exploit the multi-modal capabilities of 4WIS platforms. To address this limitation, we propose an extended Hybrid A* framework that operates in a four-dimensional state space incorporating both spatial states and motion modes. Within this framework, we design multi-modal Reeds-Shepp curves tailored to the distinct kinematic constraints of each motion mode, develop an enhanced heuristic function that accounts for mode-switching costs, and introduce a terminal connection strategy with intelligent mode selection to ensure smooth transitions between different steering patterns. The proposed planner enables seamless integration of multiple motion modalities within a single path, significantly improving flexibility and adaptability in complex environments. Results demonstrate significantly improved planning performance for 4WIS robots in complex environments.

Title: Digital Twin based Automatic Reconfiguration of Robotic Systems in Smart Environments
Authors: Angelos Alexopoulos, Agorakis Bompotas, Nikitas Rigas Kalogeropoulos, Panagiotis Kechagias, Athanasios P. Kalogeras, Christos Alexakos
Abstract: Robotic systems have become integral to smart environments, enabling applications ranging from urban surveillance and automated agriculture to industrial automation. However, their effective operation in dynamic settings - such as smart cities and precision farming - is challenged by continuously evolving topographies and environmental conditions. Traditional control systems often struggle to adapt quickly, leading to inefficiencies or operational failures. To address this limitation, we propose a novel framework for autonomous and dynamic reconfiguration of robotic controllers using Digital Twin technology. Our approach leverages a virtual replica of the robot's operational environment to simulate and optimize movement trajectories in response to real-world changes. By recalculating paths and control parameters in the Digital Twin and deploying the updated code to the physical robot, our method ensures rapid and reliable adaptation without manual intervention. This work advances the integration of Digital Twins in robotics, offering a scalable solution for enhancing autonomy in smart, dynamic environments.

Title: Iterative Tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control for Robotic Manufacturing Tasks
Authors: Deepak Ingole, Valentin Bhend, Shiva Ganesh Murali, Oliver Dobrich, Alisa Rupenyan
Abstract: Manufacturing processes are often perturbed by drifts in the environment and wear in the system, requiring control re-tuning even in the presence of repetitive operations. This paper presents an iterative learning framework for automatic tuning of Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) weighting matrices based on task-level performance feedback. Inspired by norm-optimal Iterative Learning Control (ILC), the proposed method adaptively adjusts NMPC weights Q and R across task repetitions to minimize key performance indicators (KPIs) related to tracking accuracy, control effort, and saturation. Unlike gradient-based approaches that require differentiating through the NMPC solver, we construct an empirical sensitivity matrix, enabling structured weight updates without analytic derivatives. The framework is validated through simulation on a UR10e robot performing carbon fiber winding on a tetrahedral core. Results demonstrate that the proposed approach converges to near-optimal tracking performance (RMSE within 0.3% of offline Bayesian Optimization (BO)) in just 4 online repetitions, compared to 100 offline evaluations required by BO algorithm. The method offers a practical solution for adaptive NMPC tuning in repetitive robotic tasks, combining the precision of carefully optimized controllers with the flexibility of online adaptation.

Title: NOWA: Null-space Optical Watermark for Invisible Capture Fingerprinting and Tamper Localization
Authors: Edwin Vargas, Jhon Lopez, Henry Arguello, Ashok Veeraraghavan
Abstract: Ensuring the authenticity and ownership of digital images is increasingly challenging as modern editing tools enable highly realistic forgeries. Existing image protection systems mainly rely on digital watermarking, which is susceptible to sophisticated digital attacks. To address this limitation, we propose a hybrid optical-digital framework that incorporates physical authentication cues during image formation and preserves them through a learned reconstruction process. At the optical level, a phase mask in the camera aperture produces a Null-space Optical Watermark (NOWA) that lies in the Null Space of the imaging operator and therefore remains invisible in the captured image. Then, a Null-Space Network (NSN) performs measurement-consistent reconstruction that delivers high-quality protected images while preserving the NOWA signature. The proposed design enables tamper localization by projecting the image onto the camera's null space and detecting pixel-level inconsistencies. Our design preserves perceptual quality, resists common degradations such as compression, and establishes a structural security asymmetry: without access to the optical or NSN parameters, adversaries cannot forge the NOWA signature. Experiments with simulations and a prototype camera demonstrate competitive performance in terms of image quality preservation, and tamper localization accuracy compared to state-of-the-art digital watermarking and learning-based authentication methods.

Title: Adaptive Learning Guided by Bias-Noise-Alignment Diagnostics
Authors: Akash Samanta, Sheldon Williamson
Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference (TD) error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Within this framework, we introduce three diagnostic-driven instantiations: the Human-inspired Supervised Adaptive Optimizer (HSAO), Hybrid Error-Diagnostic Reinforcement Learning (HED-RL) for actor-critic methods, and the Meta-Learned Learning Policy (MLLP). Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to TD error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.
