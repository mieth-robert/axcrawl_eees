Title: Interference in Wireless Networks -- A Power Allocation Approach
Authors: Tzalik Maimon, Shirley Alus, Gil Kedar
Abstract: Co-Channel Interference (CCI) is a fundamental problem in wireless communication networks. It is a well-studied problem in the field. As channels use the same frequency, interference in the radio waves occurs which, in turn, reduces the capacity of the interfered channels. There is a need to use the least number of frequencies as communication networks advance to 5G. In this paper, we present a novel technique to manage interference on channels. We use time division for links of the same frequency and, as a result, we show a significant reduction in the number of frequencies used overall in the network.

Authors: Masahiro Kurisaki
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.

Title: RNN-Based Models for Predicting Seizure Onset in Epileptic Patients
Authors: Mathan Kumar Mounagurusamy, Thiyagarajan V S, Abdur Rahman, Shravan Chandak, D. Balaji, Venkateswara Rao Jallepalli
Abstract: Early management and better clinical outcomes for epileptic patients depend on seizure prediction. The accuracy and false alarm rates of existing systems are often compromised by their dependence on static thresholds and basic Electroencephalogram (EEG) properties. A novel Recurrent Neural Network (RNN)-based method for seizure start prediction is proposed in the article to overcome these limitations. As opposed to conventional techniques, the proposed system makes use of Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks to extract temporal correlations from unprocessed EEG data. It enables the system to adapt dynamically to the unique EEG patterns of each patient, improving prediction accuracy. The methodology of the system comprises thorough data collecting, preprocessing, and LSTM-based feature extraction. Annotated EEG datasets are then used for model training and validation. Results show a considerable reduction in false alarm rates (average of 6.8%) and an improvement in prediction accuracy (90.2% sensitivity, 88.9% specificity, and AUC-ROC of 93). Additionally, computational efficiency is significantly higher than that of existing systems (12 ms processing time, 45 MB memory consumption). About improving seizure prediction reliability, these results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed RNN-based strategy, opening up possibilities for its practical application to improve epilepsy treatment.

The agents provide multimodal communication with their users in which speech interaction is included. Our proposal combines different techniques related to Artificial Intelligence, Natural Language Processing, Affective Computing, and User Modeling. Firstly, the developed conversational agents. A statistical methodology has been developed to model the system conversational behavior, which is learned from an initial corpus and improved with the knowledge acquired from the successive interactions.

Title: WhiSPA: Semantically and Psychologically Aligned Whisper with Self-Supervised Contrastive and Student-Teacher Learning
Authors: Rajath Rao, Adithya Ganesan, Oscar Kjell, Jonah Luby, Akshay Raghavan, Scott Feltman, Whitney Ringwald, Ryan L. Boyd, Benjamin Luft, Camilo Ruggero, Neville Ryant, Roman Kotov, H. Andrew Schwartz
Abstract: Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on separate processing pipelines between text and audio, not fully leveraging the inherent overlap between these modalities for understanding human communication. Language models excel at capturing semantic meaning from text that can complement the additional prosodic, emotional, and acoustic cues from speech. This work bridges the gap by proposing WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic-Psychological Alignment), a novel audio encoder trained with a contrastive student-teacher learning objective. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper audio embeddings with text representations from an SBERT encoder and text-based assessments of psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised and downstream mental health tasks, WhiSPA surpasses state-of-the-art speech models, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% on the segment-level self-supervised objective and 83.8% on 11 psychological downstream tasks. WhiSPA demonstrates that cross-modal alignment can increase the amount of text-semantic and psychological information captured in audio-only encoder models.

Title: Neural Kalman Filters for Acoustic Echo Cancellation
Authors: Ernst Seidel, Gerald Enzner, Pejman Mowlaee, Tim Fingscheidt
Abstract: Kalman filtering is a powerful approach to adaptive filtering for various problems in signal processing. The frequency-domain adaptive Kalman filter (FDKF), based on the concept of the acoustic state space, provides a unifying solution to the adaptive filter update and the related stepsize control. It was conceived for the problem of acoustic echo cancellation and, as such, is frequently applied in hands-free systems. This article motivates and briefly recapitulates the linear FDKF and investigates how it can be further supported by deep neural networks (DNNs) in various ways, specifically to overcome the challenges and limitations related to the usually required estimation of process and observation noise covariances for the Kalman filter. While the mere FDKF comes with very low computational complexity, its neural Kalman filter variants may deliver faster (re)convergence, better echo cancellation, and even exceed the FDKF in its excellent double-talk near-end speech preservation both under linear and nonlinear loudspeaker conditions. To provide a synopsis of the state of the art, this article contributes a comparison of a range of DNN-based extensions of FDKF in the same training framework and using the same data.

Title: MambaTron: Efficient Cross-Modal Point Cloud Enhancement using Aggregate Selective State Space Modeling
Authors: Sai Tarun Inaganti, Gennady Petrenko
Abstract: Point cloud enhancement is the process of generating a high-quality point cloud from an incomplete input. This is done by filling in the missing details from a reference like the ground truth via regression, for example. In addition to unimodal image and point cloud reconstruction, we focus on the task of view-guided point cloud completion, where we gather the missing information from an image, which represents a view of the point cloud and use it to generate the output point cloud. With the recent research efforts surrounding state-space models, originally in natural language processing and now in 2D and 3D vision, Mamba has shown promising results as an efficient alternative to the self-attention mechanism. However, there is limited research towards employing Mamba for cross-attention between the image and the input point cloud, which is crucial in multi-modal problems. In this paper, we introduce MambaTron, a Mamba-Transformer cell that serves as a building block for our network which is capable of unimodal and cross-modal reconstruction which includes view-guided point cloud this http URL explore the benefits of Mamba's long-sequence efficiency coupled with the Transformer's excellent analytical capabilities through MambaTron. This approach is one of the first attempts to implement a Mamba-based analogue of cross-attention, especially in computer vision. Our model demonstrates a degree of performance comparable to the current state-of-the-art techniques while using a fraction of the computation resources.

Title: CSF-Net: Cross-Modal Spatiotemporal Fusion Network for Pulmonary Nodule Malignancy Predicting
Authors: Yin Shen, Zhaojie Fang, Ke Zhuang, Guanyu Zhou, Xiao Yu, Yucheng Zhao, Yuan Tian, Ruiquan Ge, Changmiao Wang, Xiaopeng Fan, Ahmed Elazab
Abstract: Pulmonary nodules are an early sign of lung cancer, and detecting them early is vital for improving patient survival rates. Most current methods use only single Computed Tomography (CT) images to assess nodule malignancy. However, doctors typically make a comprehensive assessment in clinical practice by integrating follow-up CT scans with clinical data. To enhance this process, our study introduces a Cross-Modal Spatiotemporal Fusion Network, named CSF-Net, designed to predict the malignancy of pulmonary nodules using follow-up CT scans. This approach simulates the decision-making process of clinicians who combine follow-up imaging with clinical information. CSF-Net comprises three key components: spatial feature extraction module, temporal residual fusion module, and cross-modal attention fusion module. Together, these modules enable precise predictions of nodule malignancy. Additionally, we utilized the publicly available NLST dataset to screen and annotate the specific locations of pulmonary nodules and created a new dataset named NLST-cmst. Our experimental results on the NLST-cmst dataset demonstrate significant performance improvements, with an accuracy of 0.8974, a precision of 0.8235, an F1 score of 0.8750, an AUC of 0.9389, and a recall of 0.9333. These findings indicate that our multimodal spatiotemporal fusion approach, which combines follow-up data with clinical information, surpasses existing methods, underscoring its effectiveness in predicting nodule malignancy.

Title: Classification of Mild Cognitive Impairment Based on Dynamic Functional Connectivity Using Spatio-Temporal Transformer
Authors: Jing Zhang, Yanjun Lyu, Xiaowei Yu, Lu Zhang, Chao Cao, Tong Chen, Minheng Chen, Yan Zhuang, Tianming Liu, Dajiang Zhu
Abstract: Dynamic functional connectivity (dFC) using resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging (rs-fMRI) is an advanced technique for capturing the dynamic changes of neural activities, and can be very useful in the studies of brain diseases such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Yet, existing studies have not fully leveraged the sequential information embedded within dFC that can potentially provide valuable information when identifying brain conditions. In this paper, we propose a novel framework that jointly learns the embedding of both spatial and temporal information within dFC based on the transformer architecture. Specifically, we first construct dFC networks from rs-fMRI data through a sliding window strategy. Then, we simultaneously employ a temporal block and a spatial block to capture higher-order representations of dynamic spatio-temporal dependencies, via mapping them into an efficient fused feature representation. To further enhance the robustness of these feature representations by reducing the dependency on labeled data, we also introduce a contrastive learning strategy to manipulate different brain states. Experimental results on 345 subjects with 570 scans from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI) demonstrate the superiority of our proposed method for MCI (Mild Cognitive Impairment, the prodromal stage of AD) prediction, highlighting its potential for early identification of AD.

Title: Sensitivity Analysis of the Laser Power Control System to Measurement Noise in SLS 3D Printers
Authors: Hamid Toshani, Janith Petangoda, Chatura Samarakoon, Phillip Stanley-Marbell
Abstract: Uniform temperature distribution in Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) is essential for producing durable 3D prints. Achieving uniformity requires a laser power control system that minimises deviation of the printing temperatures from the target temperature. Because the estimate of the actual process temperature is an input to the laser power control, uncertainty in the estimate of the actual temperature can lead to fluctuations in laser power that affect the thermal performance of the SLS. This article investigates the sensitivity of a laser power control system to temperature measurement uncertainty. This article evaluates the effectiveness of two methods for quantifying the effect of input uncertainty on a SLS laser power control system: a recent innovation in uncertainty-tracked architecture and traditional Monte Carlo simulation. We show that recent advances in computer architecture for arithmatic on probability distributions make it possible for the first time, to perform control system uncertainty analysis with latencies under 30 ms, while achieving the same level of uncertainty analysis as Monte Carlo methods with latencies that are two orders of magnitude slower.

Title: Network Risk Estimation: A Risk Estimation Paradigm for Cyber Networks
Authors: Arda Bayer, David Maluf, Behnaam Aazhang
Abstract: Cyber networks are fundamental to many organization's infrastructure, and the size of cyber networks is increasing rapidly. Risk measurement of the entities/endpoints that make up the network via available knowledge about possible threats has been the primary tool in cyber network security. However, the dynamic behavior of the entities and the sparsity of risk-measurable points are limiting factors for risk measurement strategies, which results in poor network visibility considering the volatility of cyber networks. This work proposes a new probabilistic risk estimation approach to network security, NRE, which operates on top of existing risk measurements. The proposed method NRE extracts relationships among system components from the network connection data, models risk propagation based on the learned relationships and refines the estimates whenever risk measurements are provided. In this work, (i) the risk estimation scheme is proposed, (ii) an application of quantitative risk estimates is devised, (iii) descriptiveness of the risk estimates are compared to a pure risk measurement alternative and (iv) low computational complexity of the proposed method is illustrated capable of real-time deployment. The proposed method, NRE, is ultimately a quantitative data-driven risk assessment tool that can be used to add security aspects to existing network functions, such as routing, and it provides a robust description of the network state in the presence of threats, capable of running in real-time.

Title: Digital Twin Enabled Site Specific Channel Precoding: Over the Air CIR Inference
Authors: Majumder Haider, Imtiaz Ahmed, Zoheb Hassan, Timothy J. O'Shea, Lingjia Liu, Danda B. Rawat
Abstract: This paper investigates the significance of designing a reliable, intelligent, and true physical environment-aware precoding scheme by leveraging an accurately designed channel twin model to obtain realistic channel state information (CSI) for cellular communication systems. Specifically, we propose a fine-tuned multi-step channel twin design process that can render CSI very close to the CSI of the actual environment. After generating a precise CSI, we execute precoding using the obtained CSI at the transmitter end. We demonstrate a two-step parameters' tuning approach to design channel twin by ray tracing (RT) emulation, then further fine-tuning of CSI by employing an artificial intelligence (AI) based algorithm can significantly reduce the gap between actual CSI and the fine-tuned digital twin (DT) rendered CSI. The simulation results show the effectiveness of the proposed novel approach in designing a true physical environment-aware channel twin model.

Title: UniPET-SPK: A Unified Framework for Parameter-Efficient Tuning of Pre-trained Speech Models for Robust Speaker Verification
Authors: Mufan Sang, John H. L. Hansen
Abstract: With excellent generalization ability, SSL speech models have shown impressive performance on various downstream tasks in the pre-training and fine-tuning paradigm. However, as the size of pre-trained models grows, fine-tuning becomes practically unfeasible due to expanding computation and storage requirements and the risk of overfitting. This study explores parameter-efficient tuning (PET) methods for adapting large-scale pre-trained SSL speech models to speaker verification task. Correspondingly, we propose three PET methods: (i)an adapter-tuning method, (ii)a prompt-tuning method, and (iii)a unified framework that effectively incorporates adapter-tuning and prompt-tuning with a dynamically learnable gating mechanism. First, we propose the Inner+Inter Adapter framework, which inserts two types of adapters into pre-trained models, allowing for adaptation of latent features within the intermediate Transformer layers and output embeddings from all Transformer layers, through a parallel adapter design. Second, we propose the Deep Speaker Prompting method that concatenates trainable prompt tokens into the input space of pre-trained models to guide adaptation. Lastly, we propose the UniPET-SPK, a unified framework that effectively incorporates these two alternate PET methods into a single framework with a dynamic trainable gating mechanism. The proposed UniPET-SPK learns to find the optimal mixture of PET methods to match different datasets and scenarios. We conduct a comprehensive set of experiments on several datasets to validate the effectiveness of the proposed PET methods. Experimental results on VoxCeleb, CN-Celeb, and 1st 48-UTD forensic datasets demonstrate that the proposed UniPET-SPK consistently outperforms the two PET methods, fine-tuning, and other parameter-efficient tuning methods, achieving superior performance while updating only 5.4% of the parameters.

Title: Optimizing Smart Helper Placement for Enhanced Cache Efficiency in F-RANs
Authors: Hesameddin Mokhtarzadeh, Mohammed Saif, Md. Jahangir Hossain, Julian Cheng
Abstract: Smart helpers (SHs) have been proposed to improve content delivery delays and alleviate high fronthaul loads in fog radio access networks (F-RANs). They offer an alternative to deploying additional enhanced remote radio heads (RRHs), which are often infeasible due to site constraints.} The optimal placement of SHs can significantly increase the number of users they serve which leads to enhanced cache efficiency and improved content delivery delay. In this letter, we optimize SH placement within an F-RAN to maximize the cache hit rate and further reduce the content delivery latency. We model the SH cache hit rate as a function of outage probability and user density distribution. We develop a function to estimate user density distribution leveraging the radial basis functions (RBFs) method and optimize SH placement utilizing the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm. \an{Our} numerical results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed approach in maximizing the \an{SH cache hit rate}, thereby improving delivery delays and fronthaul loads of the network.

Title: A General Bayesian Framework for Informative Input Design in System Identification
Authors: Alexandros E. Tzikas, Mykel J. Kochenderfer
Abstract: We tackle the problem of informative input design for system identification, where we select inputs, observe the corresponding outputs from the true system, and optimize the parameters of our model to best fit the data. We propose a methodology that is compatible with any system and parametric family of models. Our approach only requires input-output data from the system and first-order information from the model with respect to the parameters. Our algorithm consists of two modules. First, we formulate the problem of system identification from a Bayesian perspective and propose an approximate iterative method to optimize the model's parameters. Based on this Bayesian formulation, we are able to define a Gaussian-based uncertainty measure for the model parameters, which we can then minimize with respect to the next selected input. Our method outperforms model-free baselines with various linear and nonlinear dynamics.

Title: Subject Representation Learning from EEG using Graph Convolutional Variational Autoencoders
Authors: Aditya Mishra, Ahnaf Mozib Samin, Ali Etemad, Javad Hashemi
Abstract: We propose GC-VASE, a graph convolutional-based variational autoencoder that leverages contrastive learning for subject representation learning from EEG data. Our method successfully learns robust subject-specific latent representations using the split-latent space architecture tailored for subject identification. To enhance the model's adaptability to unseen subjects without extensive retraining, we introduce an attention-based adapter network for fine-tuning, which reduces the computational cost of adapting the model to new subjects. Our method significantly outperforms other deep learning approaches, achieving state-of-the-art results with a subject balanced accuracy of 89.81% on the ERP-Core dataset and 70.85% on the SleepEDFx-20 dataset. After subject adaptive fine-tuning using adapters and attention layers, GC-VASE further improves the subject balanced accuracy to 90.31% on ERP-Core. Additionally, we perform a detailed ablation study to highlight the impact of the key components of our method.

Title: Finite Sample Analysis of Subspace Identification Methods
Authors: Jiabao He, Ingvar Ziemann, Cristian R. Rojas, S. Joe Qin, Håkan Hjalmarsson
Abstract: As one of the mainstream approaches in system identification, subspace identification methods (SIMs) are known for their simple parameterization for MIMO systems and robust numerical properties. However, a comprehensive statistical analysis of SIMs remains an open problem. Amid renewed focus on identifying state-space models in the non-asymptotic regime, this work presents a finite sample analysis for a large class of open-loop SIMs. It establishes high-probability upper bounds for system matrices obtained via SIMs, and reveals that convergence rates for estimating Markov parameters and system matrices are $\mathcal{O}(1/\sqrt{N})$ up to logarithmic terms, in line with classical asymptotic results. Following the key steps of SIMs, we arrive at the above results by a three-step procedure. In Step 1, we begin with a parsimonious SIM (PARSIM) that uses least-squares regression to estimate multiple high-order ARX models in parallel. Leveraging a recent analysis of an individual ARX model, we obtain a union error bound for a bank of ARX models. Step 2 involves model reduction via weighted singular value decomposition (SVD), where we consider different data-dependent weighting matrices and use robustness results for SVD to obtain error bounds on extended controllability and observability matrices, respectively. The final Step 3 focuses on deriving error bounds for system matrices, where two different realization algorithms, the MOESP type and the Larimore type, are considered. Although our study initially focuses on PARSIM, the methodologies apply broadly across many variants of SIMs.

Title: SCDiar: a streaming diarization system based on speaker change detection and speech recognition
Authors: Naijun Zheng, Xucheng Wan, Kai Liu, Zhou Huan
Abstract: In hours-long meeting scenarios, real-time speech stream often struggles with achieving accurate speaker diarization, commonly leading to speaker identification and speaker count errors. To address this challenge, we propose SCDiar, a system that operates on speech segments, split at the token level by a speaker change detection (SCD) module. Building on these segments, we introduce several enhancements to efficiently select the best available segment for each speaker. These improvements lead to significant gains across various benchmarks. Notably, on real-world meeting data involving more than ten participants, SCDiar outperforms previous systems by up to 53.6\% in accuracy, substantially narrowing the performance gap between online and offline systems.

Title: FlowDAS: A Flow-Based Framework for Data Assimilation
Authors: Siyi Chen, Yixuan Jia, Qing Qu, He Sun, Jeffrey A Fessler
Abstract: Data assimilation (DA) is crucial for improving the accuracy of state estimation in complex dynamical systems by integrating observational data with physical models. Traditional solutions rely on either pure model-driven approaches, such as Bayesian filters that struggle with nonlinearity, or data-driven methods using deep learning priors, which often lack generalizability and physical interpretability. Recently, score-based DA methods have been introduced, focusing on learning prior distributions but neglecting explicit state transition dynamics, leading to limited accuracy improvements. To tackle the challenge, we introduce FlowDAS, a novel generative model-based framework using the stochastic interpolants to unify the learning of state transition dynamics and generative priors. FlowDAS achieves stable and observation-consistent inference by initializing from proximal previous states, mitigating the instability seen in score-based methods. Our extensive experiments demonstrate FlowDAS's superior performance on various benchmarks, from the Lorenz system to high-dimensional fluid super-resolution tasks. FlowDAS also demonstrates improved tracking accuracy on practical Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) task, showcasing its effectiveness in complex flow field reconstruction.

Title: Vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit via deep learning with Wi-Fi probe requests
Authors: Ziyue Li, Qianwen Guo
Abstract: This study contributes to the advancement of vehicle occupancy estimation in Automated Guideway Transit (AGT) systems using Wi-Fi probe requests and deep learning models. We propose a comprehensive framework for evaluating various approaches to occupancy estimation, particularly in the context of MAC address randomization. While many methods proposed in the literature claim effectiveness in simpler experimental settings, our research reveals that those methods are unreliable in the complex environment of AGT systems. Specifically, techniques for handling randomized MAC addresses and distinguishing between passenger and non-passenger data do not perform well in AGT systems. Despite challenges in tracking individual devices, our study demonstrates that accurate occupancy estimation using Wi-Fi probe requests remains feasible. A pilot study conducted on the Miami-Dade Metromover, an AGT system characterized by frequent stops, significant occupancy fluctuations, and absence of fare collection devices, provides a robust testing ground for the framework. Additionally, our findings show that deep learning models significantly outperform machine learning models in this context. The insights from this study can significantly enhance decision-making for transit agencies to optimize operations and elevate service quality.

Title: MFConvTr: Multi-Frequency Convolutional Transformer for Fetal Arrhythmia Detection in Non-Invasive fECG
Authors: Deva Satay Sriram Chintapenta, Aman Verma, Saikat Majumder
Abstract: NI-fECG have emerged as alternative for fetal arrhythmia monitoring. But due to multi-signal waveform they are tough to understand and due to highly varying and complex nature traditional fiducial methods cannot be applied. Further, it has also been observed that the fetal arrhythmia can be differentiated from the normal signals in both spectral and temporal scales. To this end, we propose Multi-Frequency Convolutional Transformer, a novel deep learning architecture that learns information in contexts with multiple-frequency and can model long-term dependencies. The proposed model utilizes a convolutional-backbone consisting of model Multi-Frequency Convolutions (MF-Conv) and residual connections. MF-Conv in-turn captures multi-frequency contexts in an efficient manner by splitting the input channel and then convoluting each of the splits individually with different kernel size. Accredited to these properties, the proposed model attains state-of-the-art results and that too utilizing very low number of parameters. To evaluate the proposed we also perform extensive ablation studies.

Title: Towards reconstruction of Pulsed-wave Doppler signals from Non-invasive fetal ECG
Authors: Aman Verma, Deva Satya Sriram Chintapenta, Saikat Mujumder
Abstract: Fetal cardiac health monitoring with invasive methods have a limited viability because they can only be utilized during labor and are uncomfortable. On the other hand non-invasive fECG are adulterated with maternal ECG, and hence resulting in poor analysis. In contrast, Pulsed-wave Doppler (PwD) echocardiography generates high-quality signals representing fetal blood volume inflow-outflow. It also follows non-invasive signal acquisition. The only drawback is that it requires highly expensive setup. To address this aspect, we put forward a challenging research question - can we reconstruct PwD signals using non-invasive fetal ECG?

Title: On Non-intrusive Data-driven Implementations of IRKA and Balanced Truncation
Authors: Umair Zulfiqar
Abstract: This paper introduces quadrature-based approaches that enable offline sampling of the transfer function and its derivative from available frequency response or impulse response data. Unlike quadrature-based data-driven balanced truncation, the proposed methods do not require samples of the transfer function's derivative or the impulse response's derivative. Additionally, a non-intrusive approach to track the error in IRKA as it refines the interpolation data is presented. Furthermore, a non-intrusive data-driven implementation of balanced truncation, equivalent to ADI-based low-rank balanced truncation, is proposed. This approach is not quadrature-based and only requires samples of the transfer function at the mirror images of the ADI shifts to construct the reduced-order model. The quality of the low-rank approximation of the Gramians in this method can also be monitored in a non-intrusive manner. Both the non-intrusive implementations of IRKA and balanced truncation are also extended to discrete-time systems in this paper. For discrete-time IRKA, the impulse response-based implementation uses a truncated summation approach, as the time-domain formulation of discrete-time IRKA involves summations rather than integrals. The paper includes two illustrative examples: one for the non-intrusive data-driven implementations of IRKA and balanced truncation for continuous-time systems, and another for discrete-time systems.

Title: Image-Space Gridding for Nonrigid Motion-Corrected MR Image Reconstruction
Authors: Kwang Eun Jang, Mario O. Malavé, Dwight G. Nishimura
Abstract: Motion remains a major challenge in magnetic resonance (MR) imaging, particularly in free-breathing cardiac MR imaging, where data are acquired over multiple heartbeats at varying respiratory phases. We adopt a model-based approach for nonrigid motion correction, addressing two challenges: (a) motion representation and (b) motion estimation. For motion representation, we derive image-space gridding by adapting the nonuniform fast Fourier transform (NUFFT) to represent and compute nonrigid motion, which provides an exact forward-adjoint pair of linear operators. We then introduce nonrigid SENSE operators that incorporate nonrigid motion into the multi-coil MR acquisition model. For motion estimation, we employ both low-resolution 3D image-based navigators (iNAVs) and high-resolution 3D self-navigating image-based navigators (self-iNAVs). During each heartbeat, data are acquired along two types of non-Cartesian trajectories: a subset of a high-resolution trajectory that sparsely covers 3D k-space, followed by a full low-resolution trajectory. We reconstruct 3D iNAVs for each heartbeat using the full low-resolution data, which are then used to estimate bulk motion and identify the respiratory phase of each heartbeat. By combining data from multiple heartbeats within the same respiratory phase, we reconstruct high-resolution 3D self-iNAVs, allowing estimation of nonrigid respiratory motion. For each respiratory phase, we construct the nonrigid SENSE operator, reformulating the nonrigid motion-corrected reconstruction as a standard regularized inverse problem. In a preliminary study, the proposed method enhanced sharpness of the coronary arteries and improved image quality in non-cardiac regions, outperforming translational motion-corrected reconstruction.

Title: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Mamba with k-Scaled Quantization and Reparameterization
Authors: Bo-Yun Shi, Yi-Cheng Lo, An-Yeu (Andy)Wu
Abstract: The Mamba model, utilizing a structured state-space model (SSM), offers linear time complexity and demonstrates significant potential. Vision Mamba (ViM) extends this framework to vision tasks by incorporating a bidirectional SSM and patch embedding, surpassing Transformer-based models in performance. While model quantization is essential for efficient computing, existing works have focused solely on the original Mamba model and have not been applied to ViM. Additionally, they neglect quantizing the SSM layer, which is central to Mamba and can lead to substantial error propagation by naive quantization due to its inherent structure. In this paper, we focus on the post-training quantization (PTQ) of ViM. We address the issues with three core techniques: 1) a k-scaled token-wise quantization method for linear and convolutional layers, 2) a reparameterization technique to simplify hidden state quantization, and 3) a factor-determining method that reduces computational overhead by integrating operations. Through these methods, the error caused by PTQ can be mitigated. Experimental results on ImageNet-1k demonstrate only a 0.8-1.2\% accuracy degradation due to PTQ, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Efficient Knowledge Distillation of SAM for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Kunal Dasharath Patil, Gowthamaan Palani, Ganapathy Krishnamurthi
Abstract: The Segment Anything Model (SAM) has set a new standard in interactive image segmentation, offering robust performance across various tasks. However, its significant computational requirements limit its deployment in real-time or resource-constrained environments. To address these challenges, we propose a novel knowledge distillation approach, KD SAM, which incorporates both encoder and decoder optimization through a combination of Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Perceptual Loss. This dual-loss framework captures structural and semantic features, enabling the student model to maintain high segmentation accuracy while reducing computational complexity. Based on the model evaluation on datasets, including Kvasir-SEG, ISIC 2017, Fetal Head Ultrasound, and Breast Ultrasound, we demonstrate that KD SAM achieves comparable or superior performance to the baseline models, with significantly fewer parameters. KD SAM effectively balances segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency, making it well-suited for real-time medical image segmentation applications in resource-constrained environments.

Title: CosyAudio: Improving Audio Generation with Confidence Scores and Synthetic Captions
Authors: Xinfa Zhu, Wenjie Tian, Xinsheng Wang, Lei He, Xi Wang, Sheng Zhao, Lei Xie
Abstract: Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation is an emerging area within AI-generated content (AIGC), where audio is created from natural language descriptions. Despite growing interest, developing robust TTA models remains challenging due to the scarcity of well-labeled datasets and the prevalence of noisy or inaccurate captions in large-scale, weakly labeled corpora. To address these challenges, we propose CosyAudio, a novel framework that utilizes confidence scores and synthetic captions to enhance the quality of audio generation. CosyAudio consists of two core components: AudioCapTeller and an audio generator. AudioCapTeller generates synthetic captions for audio and provides confidence scores to evaluate their accuracy. The audio generator uses these synthetic captions and confidence scores to enable quality-aware audio generation. Additionally, we introduce a self-evolving training strategy that iteratively optimizes CosyAudio across both well-labeled and weakly-labeled datasets. Initially trained with well-labeled data, AudioCapTeller leverages its assessment capabilities on weakly-labeled datasets for high-quality filtering and reinforcement learning, which further improves its performance. The well-trained AudioCapTeller refines corpora by generating new captions and confidence scores, serving for the audio generator training. Extensive experiments on open-source datasets demonstrate that CosyAudio outperforms existing models in automated audio captioning, generates more faithful audio, and exhibits strong generalization across diverse scenarios.

Title: Enhancing Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring with Features Extracted by Independent Component Analysis
Authors: Sahar Moghimian Hoosh, Ilia Kamyshev, Henni Ouerdane
Abstract: In this paper, a novel neural network architecture is proposed to address the challenges in energy disaggregation algorithms. These challenges include the limited availability of data and the complexity of disaggregating a large number of appliances operating simultaneously. The proposed model utilizes independent component analysis as the backbone of the neural network and is evaluated using the F1-score for varying numbers of appliances working concurrently. Our results demonstrate that the model is less prone to overfitting, exhibits low complexity, and effectively decomposes signals with many individual components. Furthermore, we show that the proposed model outperforms existing algorithms when applied to real-world data.

Title: Toward Explainable NILM: Real-Time Event-Based NILM Framework for High-Frequency Data
Authors: Grigorii Gerasimov, Ilia Kamyshev, Sahar Moghimian Hoosh, Elena Gryazina, Henni Ouerdane
Abstract: Non-Intrusive Load Monitoring (NILM) is an advanced, and cost-effective technique for monitoring appliance-level energy consumption. However, its adaptability is hindered by the lack of transparency and explainability. To address this challenge, this paper presents an explainable, real-time, event-based NILM framework specifically designed for high-frequency datasets. The proposed framework ensures transparency at every stage by integrating a z-score-based event detector, appliance signature estimation, Fourier-based feature extraction, an XG-Boost classifier, and post hoc SHAP analysis. The SHAP analysis further quantifies the contribution of individual features, such as cosine of specific harmonic phases, to appliance classification. The framework is trained and evaluated on the PLAID dataset, and achieved a classification accuracy of 90% while maintaining low computational requirements and a latency of less than one second.

Title: From Partial Calibration to Full Potential: A Two-Stage Sparse DOA Estimation for Incoherently-Distributed Sources with Gain-Phase Uncertainty
Authors: He Xu, Tuo Wu, Wei Liu, Maged Elkashlan, Naofal Al-Dhahir, Merouane Debbah, Chau Yuen, Hing Cheung So
Abstract: Direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation for incoherently distributed (ID) sources is essential in multipath wireless communication scenarios, yet it remains challenging due to the combined effects of angular spread and gain-phase uncertainties in antenna arrays. This paper presents a two-stage sparse DOA estimation framework, transitioning from partial calibration to full potential, under the generalized array manifold (GAM) framework. In the first stage, coarse DOA estimates are obtained by exploiting the output from a subset of partly-calibrated arrays (PCAs). In the second stage, these estimates are utilized to determine and compensate for gain-phase uncertainties across all array elements. Then a sparse total least-squares optimization problem is formulated and solved via alternating descent to refine the DOA estimates. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method attained improved estimation accuracy compared to existing approaches, while maintaining robustness against both noise and angular spread effects in practical multipath environments.

Manjón, Sergio Morell-Ortega, Marina Ruiz-Perez, Boris Mansencal, Edern Le Bot, Marien Gadea, Enrique Lanuza, Gwenaelle Catheline, Thomas Tourdias, Vincent Planche, Rémi Giraud, Denis Rivière, Jean-François Mangin, Nicole Labra-Avila, Roberto Vivo-Hernando, Gregorio Rubio, Fernando Aparici, Maria de la Iglesia-Vaya, Pierrick Coupé
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce holiAtlas, a holistic, multimodal and high-resolution human brain atlas. This atlas covers different levels of details of the human brain anatomy, from the organ to the substructure level, using a new dense labelled protocol generated from the fusion of multiple local protocols at different scales. This atlas has been constructed averaging images and segmentations of 75 healthy subjects from the Human Connectome Project database. Specifically, MR images of T1, T2 and WMn (White Matter nulled) contrasts at 0.125 $mm^{3}$ resolution that were nonlinearly registered and averaged using symmetric group-wise normalisation to construct the atlas. At the finest level, the holiAtlas protocol has 350 different labels derived from 10 different delineation protocols. These labels were grouped at different scales to provide a holistic view of the brain at different levels in a coherent and consistent manner. This multiscale and multimodal atlas can be used for the development of new ultra-high resolution segmentation methods that can potentially leverage the early detection of neurological disorders.

Title: Understanding the Effect of Long-Term Memory Model Parameters in Pole-Zero Identification for Stability Analysis of Power Amplifiers
Authors: Libe Mori, Aitziber Anakabe, Juan-Mari Collantes, Vincent Armengaud
Abstract: Understanding the nature of potential instabilities is indispensable for the stabilization of power amplifiers. Pole-zero identification is one of the techniques that can be used to determine the stability of a design in large-signal operation. In this work, the possible presence of poles at the fundamental frequency linked to the long-term memory parameters of the transistor's model (self-heating and traps) is presented and discussed. The paper shows how their effect on the identified frequency responses around the fundamental frequency may compromise the stability analysis results and the assessment of stability margins. The low observability of the poles at the fundamental frequency highlights the importance of an accurate identification of real poles in low-frequency bands. A specific algorithm for the automatic frequency domain identification of non-resonant frequency responses and a procedure for detecting and reducing overfitting of real poles is proposed in this article. The benefits of the proposed methodology to correctly detect and analyze real poles at low frequencies is demonstrated through Monte-Carlo sensitivity analyses of two different amplifier designs.

Title: Data-Efficient Extremum-Seeking Control Using Kernel-Based Function Approximation
Authors: Wouter Weekers, Alessandro Saccon, Nathan van de Wouw
Abstract: Existing extremum-seeking control (ESC) approaches typically rely on applying repeated perturbations to input parameters and performing measurements of the corresponding performance output. Performing these measurements can be costly in practical applications, e.g., due to the use of resources, making it desirable to reduce the number of performed measurements. Moreover, the required separation between the different timescales in the ESC loop typically results in slow convergence. With these challenges in mind, this work presents an approach aimed at both increasing the convergence rate and reducing the number of measurements that need to be performed. In the proposed approach, input-output data obtained during operation is used to construct online an approximation of the system's underlying cost function. By using this approximation to perform parameter updates when a decrease in the cost can be guaranteed, instead of performing additional measurements to perform this update, more efficient use is made of the collected data. As a result, reductions in both the required number of measurements and update steps are indeed obtained. In addition, a stability analysis of the novel ESC approach is provided. The benefits of the synergy between kernel-based function approximation and standard ESC is demonstrated in simulation on a multi-input dynamical system.

Title: In-Circuit Characterization of Low-Frequency Stability Margins in Power Amplifiers
Authors: Jose Manuel Gonzalez, Nerea Otegi, Aitziber Anakabe, Libe Mori, Asier Barcenilla, Juan-Mari Collantes
Abstract: Low-frequency resonances with low stability margins affect video bandwidth characteristics of power amplifiers. In this work, a non-connectorized measurement technique is presented to obtain the low-frequency critical poles at internal nodes of a hybrid amplifier. The experimental setup uses a high impedance probe connected to a vector network analyzer (VNA) to obtain a fully calibrated closed-loop frequency response that is identified to get the poles of the device at low frequency. Compared to previous connectorized solutions, the approach avoids the ad-hoc insertion of extra RF connectors to access the low-frequency dynamics of the amplifier. In addition, it simplifies the characterization at multiple internal nodes, which is worthwhile for an efficient detection and fixing of critical low frequency dynamics in multistage power amplifiers. The technique is first applied to dc steady state regimes and compared to the connectorized approach on a single stage amplifier. Next, it is applied to a three-stage amplifier to show its potential to detect the origin of the undesired dynamics and the most effective way to increase stability margin. Finally, the technique has been extended to the large-signal case to increase its usefulness for the design and diagnosis of high power amplifiers.

Title: Federated Learning Strategies for Coordinated Beamforming in Multicell ISAC
Authors: Lai Jiang, Kaitao Meng, Murat Temiz, Jiaming Hu, Christos Masouros
Abstract: We propose two cooperative beamforming frameworks based on federated learning (FL) for multi-cell integrated sensing and communications (ISAC) systems. Our objective is to address the following dilemma in multicell ISAC: 1) Beamforming strategies that rely solely on local channel information risk generating significant inter-cell interference (ICI), which degrades network performance for both communication users and sensing receivers in neighboring cells; 2) conversely centralized beamforming strategies can mitigate ICI by leveraging global channel information, but they come with substantial transmission overhead and latency that can be prohibitive for latency-sensitive and source-constrained applications. To tackle these challenges, we first propose a partially decentralized training framework motivated by the vertical federated learning (VFL) paradigm. In this framework, the participating base stations (BSs) collaboratively design beamforming matrices under the guidance of a central server. The central server aggregates local information from the BSs and provides feedback, allowing BSs to implicitly manage ICI without accessing the global channel information. To make the solution scalable for densely deployed wireless networks, we take further steps to reduce communication overhead by presenting a fully decentralized design based on the horizontal federated learning (HFL). Specifically, we develop a novel loss function to control the interference leakage power, enabling a more efficient training process by entirely eliminating local channel information exchange. Numerical results show that the proposed solutions can achieve significant performance improvements comparable to the benchmarks in terms of both communication and radar information rates.

Title: Improved Encoding for Overfitted Video Codecs
Authors: Thomas Leguay, Théo Ladune, Pierrick Philippe, Olivier Deforges
Abstract: Overfitted neural video codecs offer a decoding complexity orders of magnitude smaller than their autoencoder counterparts. Yet, this low complexity comes at the cost of limited compression efficiency, in part due to their difficulty capturing accurate motion information. This paper proposes to guide motion information learning with an optical flow estimator. A joint rate-distortion optimization is also introduced to improve rate distribution across the different frames. These contributions maintain a low decoding complexity of 1300 multiplications per pixel while offering compression performance close to the conventional codec HEVC and outperforming other overfitted codecs.

Title: Experimental Outdoor Performance Evaluation of TVWS Narrowband Data Communication using SDR Platform
Authors: Muneer M. AlZubi, Mohamed-Slim Alouini
Abstract: Large-scale deployment of Internet of Things (IoT) networks in the industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) band leads to spectrum congestion and requires multiple gateways to cover wide areas. This will increase cost, complexity, and energy consumption. TV White Spaces (TVWS) provides an abundant spectrum that is sufficient for low data rate IoT applications. This low-frequency band offers coverage over larger areas due to the ability of wireless signals to penetrate obstacles and terrain. In this paper, we examine the performance of narrowband data communications in TVWS through an outdoor experiment in a suburban area with line-of-sight (LOS) and non-line-of-sight (NLOS) propagation scenarios. We implement a software-defined radio (SDR) testbed and develop a GNU radio benchmark tool to perform outdoor experiments for TVWS narrowband data communication between a gateway and wireless nodes at various locations. The results reveal that the system can achieve a throughput of up to 97 Kbps with a packet error rate (PER) and packet loss rate (PLR) under 1% over NLOS paths, making it suitable for low-data rate applications. This work offers valuable insights for designing the physical layer of narrowband white space devices (WSDs). The developed benchmark tool will also greatly assist other researchers in evaluating the performance of SDR-based communication systems.

Title: Optimal control over Markovian wireless communication channels under generalized packet dropout compensation
Authors: Yuriy Zacchia Lun, Francesco Smarra, Alessandro D'Innocenzo
Abstract: Control loops closed over wireless links greatly benefit from accurate estimates of the communication channel condition. To this end, the finite-state Markov channel model allows for reliable channel state estimation. This paper develops a Markov jump linear system representation for wireless networked control with persistent channel state observation, stochastic message losses, and generalized packet dropout compensation. With this model, we solve the finite- and infinite-horizon linear quadratic regulation problems and introduce an easy-to-test stability condition for any given infinite-horizon control law. We also thoroughly analyze the impact of a scalar general dropout compensation factor on the stability and closed-loop performance of a rotary inverted pendulum controlled remotely through a wireless link. Finally, we validate the results numerically via extensive Monte Carlo simulations, showing the benefits of the proposed control strategy.

Title: Three-Dimensional Diffusion-Weighted Multi-Slab MRI With Slice Profile Compensation Using Deep Energy Model
Authors: Reza Ghorbani, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Chu-Yu Lee, Mathews Jacob, Merry Mani
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) multi-slab acquisition is a technique frequently employed in high-resolution diffusion-weighted MRI in order to achieve the best signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) efficiency. However, this technique is limited by slab boundary artifacts that cause intensity fluctuations and aliasing between slabs which reduces the accuracy of anatomical imaging. Addressing this issue is crucial for advancing diffusion MRI quality and making high-resolution imaging more feasible for clinical and research applications. In this work, we propose a regularized slab profile encoding (PEN) method within a Plug-and-Play ADMM framework, incorporating multi-scale energy (MuSE) regularization to effectively improve the slab combined reconstruction. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method significantly improves image quality compared to non-regularized and TV-regularized PEN approaches. The regularized PEN framework provides a more robust and efficient solution for high-resolution 3D diffusion MRI, potentially enabling clearer, more reliable anatomical imaging across various applications.

Authors: Suresh Babu Nettur, Shanthi Karpurapu, Unnati Nettur, Likhit Sagar Gajja, Sravanthy Myneni, Akhil Dusi, Lalithya Posham
Abstract: Early detection of COVID-19 is crucial for effective treatment and controlling its spread. This study proposes a novel hybrid deep learning model for detecting COVID-19 from CT scan images, designed to assist overburdened medical professionals. Our proposed model leverages the strengths of VGG16, DenseNet121, and MobileNetV2 to extract features, followed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA) for dimensionality reduction, after which the features are stacked and classified using a Support Vector Classifier (SVC). We conducted comparative analysis between the proposed hybrid model and individual pre-trained CNN models, using a dataset of 2,108 training images and 373 test images comprising both COVID-positive and non-COVID images. Our proposed hybrid model achieved an accuracy of 98.93%, outperforming the individual models in terms of precision, recall, F1 scores, and ROC curve performance.

Title: Foundation Models for CPS-IoT: Opportunities and Challenges
Authors: Ozan Baris, Yizhuo Chen, Gaofeng Dong, Liying Han, Tomoyoshi Kimura, Pengrui Quan, Ruijie Wang, Tianchen Wang, Tarek Abdelzaher, Mario Bergés, Paul Pu Liang, Mani Srivastava
Abstract: Methods from machine learning (ML) have transformed the implementation of Perception-Cognition-Communication-Action loops in Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) and the Internet of Things (IoT), replacing mechanistic and basic statistical models with those derived from data. However, the first generation of ML approaches, which depend on supervised learning with annotated data to create task-specific models, faces significant limitations in scaling to the diverse sensor modalities, deployment configurations, application tasks, and operating dynamics characterizing real-world CPS-IoT systems. The success of task-agnostic foundation models (FMs), including multimodal large language models (LLMs), in addressing similar challenges across natural language, computer vision, and human speech has generated considerable enthusiasm for and exploration of FMs and LLMs as flexible building blocks in CPS-IoT analytics pipelines, promising to reduce the need for costly task-specific engineering. Nonetheless, a significant gap persists between the current capabilities of FMs and LLMs in the CPS-IoT domain and the requirements they must meet to be viable for CPS-IoT applications. In this paper, we analyze and characterize this gap through a thorough examination of the state of the art and our research, which extends beyond it in various dimensions. Based on the results of our analysis and research, we identify essential desiderata that CPS-IoT domain-specific FMs and LLMs must satisfy to bridge this gap. We also propose actions by CPS-IoT researchers to collaborate in developing key community resources necessary for establishing FMs and LLMs as foundational tools for the next generation of CPS-IoT systems.

Title: SIM: Surface-based fMRI Analysis for Inter-Subject Multimodal Decoding from Movie-Watching Experiments
Authors: Simon Dahan, Gabriel Bénédict, Logan Z. J. Williams, Yourong Guo, Daniel Rueckert, Robert Leech, Emma C. Robinson
Abstract: Current AI frameworks for brain decoding and encoding, typically train and test models within the same datasets. This limits their utility for brain computer interfaces (BCI) or neurofeedback, for which it would be useful to pool experiences across individuals to better simulate stimuli not sampled during training. A key obstacle to model generalisation is the degree of variability of inter-subject cortical organisation, which makes it difficult to align or compare cortical signals across participants. In this paper we address this through the use of surface vision transformers, which build a generalisable model of cortical functional dynamics, through encoding the topography of cortical networks and their interactions as a moving image across a surface. This is then combined with tri-modal self-supervised contrastive (CLIP) alignment of audio, video, and fMRI modalities to enable the retrieval of visual and auditory stimuli from patterns of cortical activity (and vice-versa). We validate our approach on 7T task-fMRI data from 174 healthy participants engaged in the movie-watching experiment from the Human Connectome Project (HCP). Results show that it is possible to detect which movie clips an individual is watching purely from their brain activity, even for individuals and movies not seen during training. Further analysis of attention maps reveals that our model captures individual patterns of brain activity that reflect semantic and visual systems. This opens the door to future personalised simulations of brain function.

Title: Modular Framework for Uncertainty Prediction in Autonomous Vehicle Motion Forecasting within Complex Traffic Scenarios
Authors: Han Wang, Yuneil Yeo, Antonio R. Paiva, Jean Utke, Maria Laura Delle Monache
Abstract: We propose a modular modeling framework designed to enhance the capture and validation of uncertainty in autonomous vehicle (AV) trajectory prediction. Departing from traditional deterministic methods, our approach employs a flexible, end-to-end differentiable probabilistic encoder-decoder architecture. This modular design allows the encoder and decoder to be trained independently, enabling seamless adaptation to diverse traffic scenarios without retraining the entire system. Our key contributions include: (1) a probabilistic heatmap predictor that generates context-aware occupancy grids for dynamic forecasting, (2) a modular training approach that supports independent component training and flexible adaptation, and (3) a structured validation scheme leveraging uncertainty metrics to evaluate robustness under high-risk conditions. To highlight the benefits of our framework, we benchmark it against an end-to-end baseline, demonstrating faster convergence, improved stability, and flexibility. Experimental results validate these advantages, showcasing the capacity of the framework to efficiently handle complex scenarios while ensuring reliable predictions and robust uncertainty representation. This modular design offers significant practical utility and scalability for real-world autonomous driving applications.

Title: Enhanced Position Estimation in Tactile Internet-Enabled Remote Robotic Surgery Using MOESP-Based Kalman Filter
Authors: Muhammad Hanif Lashari, Wafa Batayneh, Ashfaq Khokhar, Shakil Ahmed
Abstract: Accurately estimating the position of a patient's side robotic arm in real time during remote surgery is a significant challenge, especially within Tactile Internet (TI) environments. This paper presents a new and efficient method for position estimation using a Kalman Filter (KF) combined with the Multivariable Output-Error State Space (MOESP) method for system identification. Unlike traditional approaches that require prior knowledge of the system's dynamics, this study uses the JIGSAW dataset, a comprehensive collection of robotic surgical data, along with input from the Master Tool Manipulator (MTM) to derive the state-space model directly. The MOESP method allows accurate modeling of the Patient Side Manipulator (PSM) dynamics without prior system models, improving the KF's performance under simulated network conditions, including delays, jitter, and packet loss. These conditions mimic real-world challenges in Tactile Internet applications. The findings demonstrate the KF's improved resilience and accuracy in state estimation, achieving over 95 percent accuracy despite network-induced uncertainties.

Title: Nonparametric Sparse Online Learning of the Koopman Operator
Authors: Boya Hou, Sina Sanjari, Nathan Dahlin, Alec Koppel, Subhonmesh Bose
Abstract: The Koopman operator provides a powerful framework for representing the dynamics of general nonlinear dynamical systems. Data-driven techniques to learn the Koopman operator typically assume that the chosen function space is closed under system dynamics. In this paper, we study the Koopman operator via its action on the reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS), and explore the mis-specified scenario where the dynamics may escape the chosen function space. We relate the Koopman operator to the conditional mean embeddings (CME) operator and then present an operator stochastic approximation algorithm to learn the Koopman operator iteratively with control over the complexity of the representation. We provide both asymptotic and finite-time last-iterate guarantees of the online sparse learning algorithm with trajectory-based sampling with an analysis that is substantially more involved than that for finite-dimensional stochastic approximation. Numerical examples confirm the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm.

Title: Safe Gradient Flow for Bilevel Optimization
Authors: Sina Sharifi, Nazanin Abolfazli, Erfan Yazdandoost Hamedani, Mahyar Fazlyab
Abstract: Bilevel optimization is a key framework in hierarchical decision-making, where one problem is embedded within the constraints of another. In this work, we propose a control-theoretic approach to solving bilevel optimization problems. Our method consists of two components: a gradient flow mechanism to minimize the upper-level objective and a safety filter to enforce the constraints imposed by the lower-level problem. Together, these components form a safe gradient flow that solves the bilevel problem in a single loop. To improve scalability with respect to the lower-level problem's dimensions, we introduce a relaxed formulation and design a compact variant of the safe gradient flow. This variant minimizes the upper-level objective while ensuring the lower-level solution remains within a user-defined distance. Using Lyapunov analysis, we establish convergence guarantees for the dynamics, proving that they converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution. Numerical experiments further validate the effectiveness of the proposed approaches. Our contributions provide both theoretical insights and practical tools for efficiently solving bilevel optimization problems.

Title: Fine-Tuned Language Models as Space Systems Controllers
Authors: Enrico M. Zucchelli, Di Wu, Julia Briden, Christian Hofmann, Victor Rodriguez-Fernandez, Richard Linares
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs), or foundation models (FMs), are pretrained transformers that coherently complete sentences auto-regressively. In this paper, we show that LLMs can control simplified space systems after some additional training, called fine-tuning. We look at relatively small language models, ranging between 7 and 13 billion parameters. We focus on four problems: a three-dimensional spring toy problem, low-thrust orbit transfer, low-thrust cislunar control, and powered descent guidance. The fine-tuned LLMs are capable of controlling systems by generating sufficiently accurate outputs that are multi-dimensional vectors with up to 10 significant digits. We show that for several problems the amount of data required to perform fine-tuning is smaller than what is generally required of traditional deep neural networks (DNNs), and that fine-tuned LLMs are good at generalizing outside of the training dataset. Further, the same LLM can be fine-tuned with data from different problems, with only minor performance degradation with respect to LLMs trained for a single application. This work is intended as a first step towards the development of a general space systems controller.

Title: Benchmarking Model Predictive Control and Reinforcement Learning Based Control for Legged Robot Locomotion in MuJoCo Simulation
Authors: Shivayogi Akki, Tan Chen
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) and Reinforcement Learning (RL) are two prominent strategies for controlling legged robots, each with unique strengths. RL learns control policies through system interaction, adapting to various scenarios, whereas MPC relies on a predefined mathematical model to solve optimization problems in real-time. Despite their widespread use, there is a lack of direct comparative analysis under standardized conditions. This work addresses this gap by benchmarking MPC and RL controllers on a Unitree Go1 quadruped robot within the MuJoCo simulation environment, focusing on a standardized task-straight walking at a constant velocity. Performance is evaluated based on disturbance rejection, energy efficiency, and terrain adaptability. The results show that RL excels in handling disturbances and maintaining energy efficiency but struggles with generalization to new terrains due to its dependence on learned policies tailored to specific environments. In contrast, MPC shows enhanced recovery capabilities from larger perturbations by leveraging its optimization-based approach, allowing for a balanced distribution of control efforts across the robot's joints. The results provide a clear understanding of the advantages and limitations of both RL and MPC, offering insights into selecting an appropriate control strategy for legged robotic applications.

Title: SHIELD: Secure Host-Independent Extensible Logging for SATA/Network Storage Towards Ransomware Detection
Authors: Md Raz, P.V. Sai Charan, Prashanth Krishnamurthy, Farshad Khorrami, Ramesh Karri
Abstract: As malware such as ransomware becomes sophisticated, the ability to find and neutralize it requires more robust and tamper-resistant solutions. Current methods rely on data from compromised hosts, lack hardware isolation, and cannot detect emerging threats. To address these limitations, we introduce SHIELD - a detection architecture leveraging FPGA-based open-source SATA and Network Block Device (NBD) technology to provide off-host, tamper-proof measurements for continuous observation of disk activity for software executing on a target device. SHIELD provides three distinct contributions: It (1) develops a framework to obtain and analyze multi-level hardware metrics at NBD, FPGA, and SATA storage levels, and shows their ability to differentiate between harmless and malicious software; (2) Broadens the functionality of an open-source FPGA-driven SATA Host Bus Adapter (HBA) to offer complete data storage capabilities through NBD without relying on the host system; (3) Provides a foundation for using the methodology and metrics in automated machine learning-assisted detection and ASIC integration for advanced mitigation capabilities in data storage devices. SHIELD analyzes 10 benign programs and 10 modern ransomware families to illustrate its capacity for real-time monitoring and use in distinguishing between ransomware and benign software. Experimental evidence shows SHIELD's robust host-independent and hardware-assisted metrics are a basis for detection, allowing to observe program execution and detect malicious activities at the storage level.

Title: An LLM Benchmark for Addressee Recognition in Multi-modal Multi-party Dialogue
Authors: Koji Inoue, Divesh Lala, Mikey Elmers, Keiko Ochi, Tatsuya Kawahara
Abstract: Handling multi-party dialogues represents a significant step for advancing spoken dialogue systems, necessitating the development of tasks specific to multi-party interactions. To address this challenge, we are constructing a multi-modal multi-party dialogue corpus of triadic (three-participant) discussions. This paper focuses on the task of addressee recognition, identifying who is being addressed to take the next turn, a critical component unique to multi-party dialogue systems. A subset of the corpus was annotated with addressee information, revealing that explicit addressees are indicated in approximately 20% of conversational turns. To evaluate the task's complexity, we benchmarked the performance of a large language model (GPT-4o) on addressee recognition. The results showed that GPT-4o achieved an accuracy only marginally above chance, underscoring the challenges of addressee recognition in multi-party dialogue. These findings highlight the need for further research to enhance the capabilities of large language models in understanding and navigating the intricacies of multi-party conversational dynamics.

Title: Vision-based autonomous structural damage detection using data-driven methods
Authors: Seyyed Taghi Ataei, Parviz Mohammad Zadeh, Saeid Ataei
Abstract: This study addresses the urgent need for efficient and accurate damage detection in wind turbine structures, a crucial component of renewable energy infrastructure. Traditional inspection methods, such as manual assessments and non-destructive testing (NDT), are often costly, time-consuming, and prone to human error. To tackle these challenges, this research investigates advanced deep learning algorithms for vision-based structural health monitoring (SHM). A dataset of wind turbine surface images, featuring various damage types and pollution, was prepared and augmented for enhanced model training. Three algorithms-YOLOv7, its lightweight variant, and Faster R-CNN- were employed to detect and classify surface damage. The models were trained and evaluated on a dataset split into training, testing, and evaluation subsets (80%-10%-10%). Results indicate that YOLOv7 outperformed the others, achieving 82.4% mAP@50 and high processing speed, making it suitable for real-time inspections. By optimizing hyperparameters like learning rate and batch size, the models' accuracy and efficiency improved further. YOLOv7 demonstrated significant advancements in detection precision and execution speed, especially for real-time applications. However, challenges such as dataset limitations and environmental variability were noted, suggesting future work on segmentation methods and larger datasets. This research underscores the potential of vision-based deep learning techniques to transform SHM practices by reducing costs, enhancing safety, and improving reliability, thus contributing to the sustainable maintenance of critical infrastructure and supporting the longevity of wind energy systems.

Title: Quantum advantage in decentralized control of POMDPs: A control-theoretic view of the Mermin-Peres square
Authors: Venkat Anantharam
Abstract: Consider a decentralized partially-observed Markov decision problem (POMDP) with multiple cooperative agents aiming to maximize a long-term-average reward criterion. We observe that the availability, at a fixed rate, of entangled states of a product quantum system between the agents, where each agent has access to one of the component systems, can result in strictly improved performance even compared to the scenario where common randomness is provided to the agents, i.e. there is a quantum advantage in decentralized control. This observation comes from a simple reinterpretation of the conclusions of the well-known Mermin-Peres square, which underpins the Mermin-Peres game. While quantum advantage has been demonstrated earlier in one-shot team problems of this kind, it is notable that there are examples where there is a quantum advantage for the one-shot criterion but it disappears in the dynamical scenario. The presence of a quantum advantage in dynamical scenarios is thus seen to be a novel finding relative to the current state of knowledge about the achievable performance in decentralized control problems. This paper is dedicated to the memory of Pravin P. Varaiya.

Abstract: This report presents our approach for the IEEE SP Cup 2025: Deepfake Face Detection in the Wild (DFWild-Cup), focusing on detecting deepfakes across diverse datasets. Our methodology employs advanced backbone models, including MaxViT, CoAtNet, and EVA-02, fine-tuned using supervised contrastive loss to enhance feature separation. These models were specifically chosen for their complementary strengths. Integration of convolution layers and strided attention in MaxViT is well-suited for detecting local features. In contrast, hybrid use of convolution and attention mechanisms in CoAtNet effectively captures multi-scale features. Robust pretraining with masked image modeling of EVA-02 excels at capturing global features. After training, we freeze the parameters of these models and train the classification heads. Finally, a majority voting ensemble is employed to combine the predictions from these models, improving robustness and generalization to unseen scenarios. The proposed system addresses the challenges of detecting deepfakes in real-world conditions and achieves a commendable accuracy of 95.83% on the validation dataset.

Title: Meta-Federated Learning: A Novel Approach for Real-Time Traffic Flow Management
Authors: Bob Johnson, Michael Geller
Abstract: Efficient management of traffic flow in urban environments presents a significant challenge, exacerbated by dynamic changes and the sheer volume of data generated by modern transportation networks. Traditional centralized traffic management systems often struggle with scalability and privacy concerns, hindering their effectiveness. This paper introduces a novel approach by combining Federated Learning (FL) and Meta-Learning (ML) to create a decentralized, scalable, and adaptive traffic management system. Our approach, termed Meta-Federated Learning, leverages the distributed nature of FL to process data locally at the edge, thereby enhancing privacy and reducing latency. Simultaneously, ML enables the system to quickly adapt to new traffic conditions without the need for extensive retraining. We implement our model across a simulated network of smart traffic devices, demonstrating that Meta-Federated Learning significantly outperforms traditional models in terms of prediction accuracy and response time. Furthermore, our approach shows remarkable adaptability to sudden changes in traffic patterns, suggesting a scalable solution for real-time traffic management in smart cities. This study not only paves the way for more resilient urban traffic systems but also exemplifies the potential of integrated FL and ML in other real-world applications.

Title: AVE Speech Dataset: A Comprehensive Benchmark for Multi-Modal Speech Recognition Integrating Audio, Visual, and Electromyographic Signals
Authors: Dongliang Zhou, Yakun Zhang, Jinghan Wu, Xingyu Zhang, Liang Xie, Erwei Yin
Abstract: The global aging population faces considerable challenges, particularly in communication, due to the prevalence of hearing and speech impairments. To address these, we introduce the AVE speech dataset, a comprehensive multi-modal benchmark for speech recognition tasks. The dataset includes a 100-sentence Mandarin Chinese corpus with audio signals, lip-region video recordings, and six-channel electromyography (EMG) data, collected from 100 participants. Each subject read the entire corpus ten times, with each sentence averaging approximately two seconds in duration, resulting in over 55 hours of multi-modal speech data per modality. Experiments demonstrate that combining these modalities significantly improves recognition performance, particularly in cross-subject and high-noise environments. To our knowledge, this is the first publicly available sentence-level dataset integrating these three modalities for large-scale Mandarin speech recognition. We expect this dataset to drive advancements in both acoustic and non-acoustic speech recognition research, enhancing cross-modal learning and human-machine interaction.

However, most existing approaches focus on single-modality data exchange, limiting the potential of both homogeneous and heterogeneous fusion across agents. This overlooks the opportunity to utilize multi-modality data per agent, restricting the system's performance. In the automotive industry, manufacturers adopt diverse sensor configurations, resulting in heterogeneous combinations of sensor modalities across agents. To harness the potential of every possible data source for optimal performance, we design a robust LiDAR and camera cross-modality fusion module, Radian-Glue-Attention (RG-Attn), applicable to both intra-agent cross-modality fusion and inter-agent cross-modality fusion scenarios, owing to the convenient coordinate conversion by transformation matrix and the unified sampling/inversion mechanism. We also propose two different architectures, named Paint-To-Puzzle (PTP) and Co-Sketching-Co-Coloring (CoS-CoCo), for conducting cooperative perception. PTP aims for maximum precision performance and achieves smaller data packet size by limiting cross-agent fusion to a single instance, but requiring all participants to be equipped with LiDAR. In contrast, CoS-CoCo supports agents with any configuration-LiDAR-only, camera-only, or LiDAR-camera-both, presenting more generalization ability. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance on both real and simulated cooperative perception datasets. The code will be released at GitHub in early 2025.

Title: Whispers of Sound-Enhancing Information Extraction from Depression Patients' Unstructured Data through Audio and Text Emotion Recognition and Llama Fine-tuning
Authors: Lindy Gan, Yifan Huang, Xiaoyang Gao, Jiaming Tan, Fujun Zhao, Tao Yang
Abstract: This study proposes an innovative multimodal fusion model based on a teacher-student architecture to enhance the accuracy of depression classification. Our designed model addresses the limitations of traditional methods in feature fusion and modality weight allocation by introducing multi-head attention mechanisms and weighted multimodal transfer learning. Leveraging the DAIC-WOZ dataset, the student fusion model, guided by textual and auditory teacher models, achieves significant improvements in classification accuracy. Ablation experiments demonstrate that the proposed model attains an F1 score of 99. 1% on the test set, significantly outperforming unimodal and conventional approaches. Our method effectively captures the complementarity between textual and audio features while dynamically adjusting the contributions of the teacher models to enhance generalization capabilities. The experimental results highlight the robustness and adaptability of the proposed framework in handling complex multimodal data. This research provides a novel technical framework for multimodal large model learning in depression analysis, offering new insights into addressing the limitations of existing methods in modality fusion and feature extraction.

Title: Late Breaking Results: Energy-Efficient Printed Machine Learning Classifiers with Sequential SVMs
Authors: Spyridon Besias, Ilias Sertaridis, Florentia Afentaki, Konstantinos Balaskas, Georgios Zervakis
Abstract: Printed Electronics (PE) provide a mechanically flexible and cost-effective solution for machine learning (ML) circuits, compared to silicon-based technologies. However, due to large feature sizes, printed classifiers are limited by high power, area, and energy overheads, which restricts the realization of battery-powered systems. In this work, we design sequential printed bespoke Support Vector Machine (SVM) circuits that adhere to the power constraints of existing printed batteries while minimizing energy consumption, thereby boosting battery life. Our results show 6.5x energy savings while maintaining higher accuracy compared to the state of the art.

Title: Optimization and Learning in Open Multi-Agent Systems
Authors: Diego Deplano, Nicola Bastianello, Mauro Franceschelli, Karl H. Johansson
Abstract: Modern artificial intelligence relies on networks of agents that collect data, process information, and exchange it with neighbors to collaboratively solve optimization and learning problems. This article introduces a novel distributed algorithm to address a broad class of these problems in "open networks", where the number of participating agents may vary due to several factors, such as autonomous decisions, heterogeneous resource availability, or DoS attacks. Extending the current literature, the convergence analysis of the proposed algorithm is based on the newly developed "Theory of Open Operators", which characterizes an operator as open when the set of components to be updated changes over time, yielding to time-varying operators acting on sequences of points of different dimensions and compositions. The mathematical tools and convergence results developed here provide a general framework for evaluating distributed algorithms in open networks, allowing to characterize their performance in terms of the punctual distance from the optimal solution, in contrast with regret-based metrics that assess cumulative performance over a finite-time horizon. As illustrative examples, the proposed algorithm is used to solve dynamic consensus or tracking problems on different metrics of interest, such as average, median, and min/max value, as well as classification problems with logistic loss functions.

Title: Detecting Critical Resonances in Microwave Amplifiers through Noise Simulations
Authors: Juan-Mari Collantes, Nerea Otegi, Aitziber Anakabe, Libe Mori, Asier Barcenilla, Jose Manuel Gonzalez-Perez
Abstract: The presence of critical resonances in microwave power amplifiers has a negative impact on its behavior and performance. These critical resonances are usually predicted from pole-zero stability simulations. In this paper, a different and less demanding approach for the circuit designer is proposed. It is based on performing noise simulations of the amplifier and observing the rise in the noise spectrum that happens when the system has low damping poles. Critical resonance detection is simplified since no additional probes have to be inserted in the circuit and no post-processing for pole-zero analysis is required. The technique is applied to two amplifier prototypes fabricated in microstrip hybrid technology and the results are compared with the conventional pole-zero approach.

Title: MIDI-GPT: A Controllable Generative Model for Computer-Assisted Multitrack Music Composition
Authors: Philippe Pasquier, Jeff Ens, Nathan Fradet, Paul Triana, Davide Rizzotti, Jean-Baptiste Rolland, Maryam Safi
Abstract: We present and release MIDI-GPT, a generative system based on the Transformer architecture that is designed for computer-assisted music composition workflows. MIDI-GPT supports the infilling of musical material at the track and bar level, and can condition generation on attributes including: instrument type, musical style, note density, polyphony level, and note duration. In order to integrate these features, we employ an alternative representation for musical material, creating a time-ordered sequence of musical events for each track and concatenating several tracks into a single sequence, rather than using a single time-ordered sequence where the musical events corresponding to different tracks are interleaved. We also propose a variation of our representation allowing for expressiveness. We present experimental results that demonstrate that MIDI-GPT is able to consistently avoid duplicating the musical material it was trained on, generate music that is stylistically similar to the training dataset, and that attribute controls allow enforcing various constraints on the generated material. We also outline several real-world applications of MIDI-GPT, including collaborations with industry partners that explore the integration and evaluation of MIDI-GPT into commercial products, as well as several artistic works produced using it.

Title: Adaptive multipliers for extrapolation in frequency
Authors: Diego Castelli Lacunza, Carlos A. Sing Long
Abstract: Resolving the details of an object from coarse-scale measurements is a classical problem in applied mathematics. This problem is usually formulated as extrapolating the Fourier transform of the object from a bounded region to the entire space, that is, in terms of performing extrapolation in frequency. This problem is ill-posed unless one assumes that the object has some additional structure. When the object is compactly supported, then it is well-known that its Fourier transform can be extended to the entire space. However, it is also well-known that this problem is severely ill-conditioned. In this work, we assume that the object is known to belong to a collection of compactly supported functions and, instead performing extrapolation in frequency to the entire space, we study the problem of extrapolating to a larger bounded set using dilations in frequency and a single Fourier multiplier. This is reminiscent of the refinement equation in multiresolution analysis. Under suitable conditions, we prove the existence of a worst-case optimal multiplier over the entire collection, and we show that all such multipliers share the same canonical structure. When the collection is finite, we show that any worst-case optimal multiplier can be represented in terms of an Hermitian matrix. This allows us to introduce a fixed-point iteration to find the optimal multiplier. This leads us to introduce a family of multipliers, which we call $\Sigma$-multipliers, that can be used to perform extrapolation in frequency. We establish connections between $\Sigma$-multipliers and multiresolution analysis. We conclude with some numerical experiments illustrating the practical consequences of our results.

Title: Cortical Temporal Mismatch Compensation in Bimodal Cochlear Implant Users: Selective Attention Decoding and Pupillometry Study
Authors: Hanna Dolhopiatenko, Waldo Nogueira
Abstract: Bimodal stimulation, combining cochlear implant (CI) and acoustic input from the opposite ear, typically enhances speech perception but varies due to factors like temporal mismatch. Previously, we used cortical auditory evoked potentials (CAEPs) to estimate this mismatch based on N1 latency differences. This study expands on that by assessing the impact of temporal mismatch compensation on speech perception. We tested bimodal CI users in three conditions: clinical, compensated temporal mismatch, and a 50 ms mismatch. Measures included speech understanding, pupillometry, CAEPs, selective attention decoding, and parietal alpha power. Despite stable speech understanding across conditions, neural measures showed stronger effects. CAEP N1P2 amplitudes were highest in the compensated condition. Phase-locking value (PLV) and selective attention decoding improved but lacked significance. Parietal alpha power increased under 50 ms mismatch, suggesting cognitive resource allocation. Pupillometry correlated with speech understanding but showed limited sensitivity. Findings highlight that neural metrics are more sensitive than behavioral tests for detecting interaural mismatch. While CAEP N1P2 amplitudes significantly improved with compensation, other neural measures showed limited effects, suggesting the need for combined temporal and spectral compensation strategies.

Title: Channel Estimation for XL-MIMO Systems with Decentralized Baseband Processing: Integrating Local Reconstruction with Global Refinement
Authors: Anzheng Tang, Jun-Bo Wang, Yijin Pan, Cheng Zeng, Yijian Chen, Hongkang Yu, Ming Xiao, Rodrigo C. de Lamare, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem for extremely large-scale multiple-input multiple-output (XL-MIMO) systems with a hybrid analog-digital architecture, implemented within a decentralized baseband processing (DBP) framework with a star topology. Existing centralized and fully decentralized channel estimation methods face limitations due to excessive computational complexity or degraded performance. To overcome these challenges, we propose a novel two-stage channel estimation scheme that integrates local sparse reconstruction with global fusion and refinement. Specifically, in the first stage, by exploiting the sparsity of channels in the angular-delay domain, the local reconstruction task is formulated as a sparse signal recovery problem. To solve it, we develop a graph neural networks-enhanced sparse Bayesian learning (SBL-GNNs) algorithm, which effectively captures dependencies among channel coefficients, significantly improving estimation accuracy. In the second stage, the local estimates from the local processing units (LPUs) are aligned into a global angular domain for fusion at the central processing unit (CPU). Based on the aggregated observations, the channel refinement is modeled as a Bayesian denoising problem. To efficiently solve it, we devise a variational message passing algorithm that incorporates a Markov chain-based hierarchical sparse prior, effectively leveraging both the sparsity and the correlations of the channels in the global angular-delay domain. Simulation results validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed SBL-GNNs algorithm over existing methods, demonstrating improved estimation performance and reduced computational complexity.

Title: The Asymptotic Capacity of Byzantine Symmetric Private Information Retrieval and Its Consequences
Authors: Mohamed Nomeir, Alptug Aytekin, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the problem of finding the asymptotic capacity of symmetric private information retrieval (SPIR) with $B$ Byzantine servers. Prior to finding the capacity, a definition for the Byzantine servers is needed since in the literature there are two different definitions. In \cite{byzantine_tpir}, where it was first defined, the Byzantine servers can send any symbol from the storage, their received queries and some independent random symbols. In \cite{unresponsive_byzantine_1}, Byzantine servers send any random symbol independently of their storage and queries. It is clear that these definitions are not identical, especially when \emph{symmetric} privacy is required. To that end, we define Byzantine servers, inspired by \cite{byzantine_tpir}, as the servers that can share everything, before and after the scheme initiation. In this setting, we find an upper bound, for an infinite number of messages case, that should be satisfied for all schemes that protect against this setting and develop a scheme that achieves this upper bound. Hence, we identify the capacity of the problem.

Title: Sensitivity of Quantitative Susceptibility Mapping in Clinical Brain Research

Abstract: Background: Quantitative susceptibility mapping (QSM) of the brain is an advanced MRI technique for assessing tissue characteristics based on magnetic susceptibility, which varies with the composition of the tissue, such as iron, calcium, and myelin levels. QSM consists of multiple processing steps, with various choices for each step. Despite its increasing application in detecting and monitoring neurodegenerative diseases, the impact of algorithmic choices in QSM's workflow on clinical outcomes has not been thoroughly quantified. Objective: This study aimed to evaluate how choices in background field removal (BFR), dipole inversion algorithms, and anatomical referencing impact the sensitivity and reproducibility error of QSM in detecting group-level and longitudinal changes in deep gray matter susceptibility in a clinical setting. Methods: We compared 378 different QSM pipelines using a 10-year follow-up dataset of healthy adults. We analyzed the sensitivity of pipelines to detect known aging-related susceptibility changes in the DGM over time. Results: We found high variability in the sensitivity of QSM pipelines to detect susceptibility changes. The study highlighted that while most pipelines could detect changes reliably, the choice of BFR algorithm and the referencing strategy substantially influenced the outcome reproducibility error and sensitivity. Notably, pipelines using RESHARP with AMP-PE, HEIDI or LSQR inversion showed the highest overall sensitivity. Conclusions: The findings underscore the critical influence of algorithmic choices in QSM processing on the accuracy and reliability of detecting physiological changes in the brain. This has profound implications for clinical research and trials where QSM is used as a biomarker for disease progression, highlighting that careful consideration should be given to pipeline configuration to optimize clinical outcomes.

Title: Collision Avoidance and Geofencing for Fixed-wing Aircraft with Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Tamas G. Molnar, Suresh K. Kannan, James Cunningham, Kyle Dunlap, Kerianne L. Hobbs, Aaron D. Ames
Abstract: Safety-critical failures often have fatal consequences in aerospace control. Control systems on aircraft, therefore, must ensure the strict satisfaction of safety constraints, preferably with formal guarantees of safe behavior. This paper establishes the safety-critical control of fixed-wing aircraft in collision avoidance and geofencing tasks. A control framework is developed wherein a run-time assurance (RTA) system modulates the nominal flight controller of the aircraft whenever necessary to prevent it from colliding with other aircraft or crossing a boundary (geofence) in space. The RTA is formulated as a safety filter using control barrier functions (CBFs) with formal guarantees of safe behavior. CBFs are constructed and compared for a nonlinear kinematic fixed-wing aircraft model. The proposed CBF-based controllers showcase the capability of safely executing simultaneous collision avoidance and geofencing, as demonstrated by simulations on the kinematic model and a high-fidelity dynamical model.

Authors: Rana Muhammad Sohaib, Syed Tariq Shah, Oluwakayode Onireti, Muhammad Ali Imran
Abstract: The advent of Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC) alongside the emergence of Open RAN (ORAN) architectures presents unprecedented challenges and opportunities in Radio Resource Management (RRM) for next-generation communication systems. This paper presents a comprehensive trade-off analysis of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) approaches designed to enhance URLLC performance within ORAN's flexible and dynamic framework. By investigating various DRL strategies for optimising RRM parameters, we explore the intricate balance between reliability, latency, and the newfound adaptability afforded by ORAN principles. Through extensive simulation results, our study compares the efficacy of different DRL models in achieving URLLC objectives in an ORAN context, highlighting the potential of DRL to navigate the complexities introduced by ORAN. The proposed study provides valuable insights into the practical implementation of DRL-based RRM solutions in ORAN-enabled wireless networks. It sheds light on the benefits and challenges of integrating DRL and ORAN for URLLC enhancements. Our findings contribute to the ongoing discourse on advancements in URLLC and ORAN, offering a roadmap for future research to pursue efficient, reliable, and flexible communication systems.

Title: Minimum Time Consensus of Multi-agent System under Fuel Constraints
Authors: Akansha Rautela, Deepak Patil, Ameer Mulla, Indra Narayan Kar
Abstract: This work addresses the problem of finding a consensus point in the state space ($\mathbb{R}^2$) for a multi-agent system that is comprised of $N$ identical double integrator agents. It is assumed that each agent operates under constrained control input (i.e., $|u_i(t)| \leq 1$ $\forall i = 1, \hdots N$). Further, a fixed fuel budget is also assumed i.e., the total amount of cumulative input that can be expended is limited by $\int_0^{t_f}|u(t)|dt \le \beta$. First, the attainable set $\mathcal{A}(t,x_0,\beta)$ at time $t$, which is the set of all states that an agent can attain starting from initial conditions $x_0$ under the fuel budget constraints at time $t$ is computed for every agent. This attainable set is a convex set for all $t\ge0$. Then the minimum time to consensus is the minimum time $\bar{t}$ at which attainable sets of all agents intersect, and the consensus point is the point of intersection. A closed-form expression for the minimum time consensus point is provided for the case of three agents. Then, using Helly's theorem, the intersection will be non-empty at a time when all the $N \choose 3$ triplets of agents have non-empty intersection. The computation of minimum time consensus for all $N \choose 3$ triplets is performed independently and can be distributed among all the $N$ agents. Finally, the overall minimum time to consensus is given by the triplet that has the highest minimum time to consensus. Further, the intersection of all the attainable sets of this triplet gives the minimum time consensus point for all $N$ agents.

Title: Whole Heart Perfusion with High-Multiband Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear Phase Modulated Extended Field of View (SMILE)
Authors: Shen Zhao, Junyu Wang, Xitong Wang, Sizhuo Liu, Quan Chen, Kevin Kai Li, Yoo Jin Lee, Michael Salerno
Abstract: Purpose: To develop a simultaneous multislice (SMS) first-pass perfusion technique that can achieve whole heart coverage with high multi-band factors, while avoiding the issue of slice leakage. Methods: The proposed Simultaneous Multislice Imaging via Linear phase modulated Extended field of view (SMILE) treats the SMS acquisition and reconstruction within an extended field of view framework, allowing arbitrarily under-sampling of phase encoding lines of the extended k-space matrix and enabling the direct application of 2D parallel imaging reconstruction techniques. We presented a theoretical framework that offers insights into the performance of SMILE. We performed retrospective comparison on 28 subjects and prospective perfusion experiments on 43 patients undergoing routine clinical CMR studies with SMILE at multiband (MB) factors of 3-5, with a net acceleration rate ($R$) of 8 and 10 respectively, and compared SMILE to conventional SMS techniques using standard FOV 2D CAIPI acquisition and standard 2D slice separation techniques including split-slice GRAPPA and ROCK-SPIRiT. Results: Retrospective studies demonstrated 5.2 to 8.0 dB improvement in signal to error ratio (SER) of SMILE over CAIPI perfusion. Prospective studies showed good image quality with grades of 4.1 $\pm$ 0.7 for MB = 3, $R$ = 8 and 3.5 $\pm$ 1.0 for MB = 5, $R$ = 10. (5-point Likert Scale) Conclusion: The theoretical derivation and experimental results validate the SMILE's improved performance at high acceleration and MB as compared to the existing 2D CAIPI SMS acquisition and reconstruction techniques for first-pass myocardial perfusion imaging.

Title: MSDet: Receptive Field Enhanced Multiscale Detection for Tiny Pulmonary Nodule
Authors: Guohui Cai, Ruicheng Zhang, Hongyang He, Zeyu Zhang, Daji Ergu, Yuanzhouhan Cao, Jinman Zhao, Binbin Hu, Zhinbin Liao, Yang Zhao, Ying Cai
Abstract: Pulmonary nodules are critical indicators for the early diagnosis of lung cancer, making their detection essential for timely treatment. However, traditional CT imaging methods suffered from cumbersome procedures, low detection rates, and poor localization accuracy. The subtle differences between pulmonary nodules and surrounding tissues in complex lung CT images, combined with repeated downsampling in feature extraction networks, often lead to missed or false detections of small nodules. Existing methods such as FPN, with its fixed feature fusion and limited receptive field, struggle to effectively overcome these issues. To address these challenges, our paper proposed three key contributions: Firstly, we proposed MSDet, a multiscale attention and receptive field network for detecting tiny pulmonary nodules. Secondly, we proposed the extended receptive domain (ERD) strategy to capture richer contextual information and reduce false positives caused by nodule occlusion. We also proposed the position channel attention mechanism (PCAM) to optimize feature learning and reduce multiscale detection errors, and designed the tiny object detection block (TODB) to enhance the detection of tiny nodules. Lastly, we conducted thorough experiments on the public LUNA16 dataset, achieving state-of-the-art performance, with an mAP improvement of 8.8% over the previous state-of-the-art method YOLOv8. These advancements significantly boosted detection accuracy and reliability, providing a more effective solution for early lung cancer diagnosis. The code will be available at this https URL

Title: Y-Configuration Active Bridge (YAB) Converter: A DAB-Type Single-Stage Isolated Three-Phase AC-DC Converter with Simple Sinusoidal Control
Authors: Mafu Zhang, Huanghaohe Zou, Saleh Farzamkia, Zibo Chen, Chen Chen, Alex Q. Huang
Abstract: This paper reviews commonly used three-phase isolated AC-DC converters and introduces a novel Y-configuration Active Bridge (YAB) converter for single-stage isolated AC-DC power conversion. The proposed YAB addresses the limitations of multi-stage designs by eliminating bulky electrolytic capacitor banks and input boost inductors, thereby enabling a simplified start-up process without the risk of inrush current. It retains the advantages of single-stage AC-DC Dual Active Bridge (AC-DC DAB) converters while significantly reducing control complexity. Across its entire operating range, the YAB achieves low total harmonic distortion, maintains relatively low current stress, and exhibits excellent soft-switching performance. The operating principle of the proposed converter is detailed, and an equivalent circuit model is presented. System performance is evaluated using a numerical Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) model. To validate the performance of the proposed converter, a three-phase 6 kW, 480 V YAB prototype is designed and tested in the laboratory. Experimental results demonstrate a maximum efficiency of 97.1\%.

Title: Multi-Functional RIS Integrated Sensing and Communications for 6G Networks
Authors: Dongsheng Han, Peng Wang, Wanli Ni, Wen Wang, Ailing Zheng, Dusit Niyato, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel multi-functional reconfigurable intelligent surface (MF-RIS) that supports signal reflection, refraction, amplification, and target sensing simultaneously. Our MF-RIS aims to enhance integrated communication and sensing (ISAC) systems, particularly in multi-user and multi-target scenarios. Equipped with reflection and refraction components (i.e., amplifiers and phase shifters), MF-RIS is able to adjust the amplitude and phase shift of both communication and sensing signals on demand. Additionally, with the assistance of sensing elements, MF-RIS is capable of capturing the echo signals from multiple targets, thereby mitigating the signal attenuation typically associated with multi-hop links. We propose a MF-RIS-enabled multi-user and multi-target ISAC system, and formulate an optimization problem to maximize the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) of sensing targets. This problem involves jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and MF-RIS configurations, subject to constraints on the communication rate, total power budget, and MF-RIS coefficients. We decompose the formulated non-convex problem into three sub-problems, and then solve them via an efficient iterative algorithm. Simulation results demonstrate that: 1) The performance of MF-RIS varies under different operating protocols, and energy splitting (ES) exhibits the best performance in the considered MF-RIS-enabled multi-user multi-target ISAC system; 2) Under the same total power budget, the proposed MF-RIS with ES protocol attains 52.2%, 73.5% and 60.86% sensing SINR gains over active RIS, passive RIS, and simultaneously transmitting and reflecting RIS (STAR-RIS), respectively; 3) The number of sensing elements will no longer improve sensing performance after exceeding a certain number.

Title: A lightweight and robust method for blind wideband-to-fullband extension of speech
Authors: Jan Büthe, Jean-Marc Valin
Abstract: Reducing the bandwidth of speech is common practice in resource constrained environments like low-bandwidth speech transmission or low-complexity vocoding. We propose a lightweight and robust method for extending the bandwidth of wideband speech signals that is inspired by classical methods developed in the speech coding context. The resulting model has just $\sim 370$~K parameters and a complexity of ~140 MFLOPS (or ~70 MMACS). With a frame size of 10 ms and a lookahead of just 0.27 ms the model is well-suited for common wideband speech codecs. We evaluate the model's robustness by pairing it with the Opus SILK speech codec (1.5 release) and verify in a P.808 DCR listening test that it significantly improves quality from 6 to 12 kb/s. We also demonstrate that Opus 1.5 together with the proposed bandwidth extension at 9 kb/s meets the quality of 3GPP EVS at 9.6 kb/s and that of Opus 1.4 at 18 kb/s showing that the blind bandwidth extension can meet the quality of classical guided bandwidth extensions.

Title: SongEditor: Adapting Zero-Shot Song Generation Language Model as a Multi-Task Editor
Authors: Chenyu Yang, Shuai Wang, Hangting Chen, Jianwei Yu, Wei Tan, Rongzhi Gu, Yaoxun Xu, Yizhi Zhou, Haina Zhu, Haizhou Li
Abstract: The emergence of novel generative modeling paradigms, particularly audio language models, has significantly advanced the field of song generation. Although state-of-the-art models are capable of synthesizing both vocals and accompaniment tracks up to several minutes long concurrently, research about partial adjustments or editing of existing songs is still underexplored, which allows for more flexible and effective production. In this paper, we present SongEditor, the first song editing paradigm that introduces the editing capabilities into language-modeling song generation approaches, facilitating both segment-wise and track-wise modifications. SongEditor offers the flexibility to adjust lyrics, vocals, and accompaniments, as well as synthesizing songs from scratch. The core components of SongEditor include a music tokenizer, an autoregressive language model, and a diffusion generator, enabling generating an entire section, masked lyrics, or even separated vocals and background music. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the proposed SongEditor achieves exceptional performance in end-to-end song editing, as evidenced by both objective and subjective metrics.

Title: A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and Optimization
Authors: Andrea Abrardo, Giulio Bartoli, Alberto Toccafondi
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) represent transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communications, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing an optimization framework for SIM that, unlike previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for broader applicability of the results. We first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a general framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture, providing insights into SIM optimization for various architectures and discussing the complexity in each case. Finally, we analyze the impact of commonly used assumptions, demonstrating that employing a complete model - one that does not rely on the unilateral hypothesis and accounts for mutual coupling among SIM elements - can yield better performance, using the realization of a 2D DFT as a case study.

Title: Slot-BERT: Self-supervised Object Discovery in Surgical Video
Authors: Guiqiu Liao, Matjaz Jogan, Marcel Hussing, Kenta Nakahashi, Kazuhiro Yasufuku, Amin Madani, Eric Eaton, Daniel A. Hashimoto
Abstract: Object-centric slot attention is a powerful framework for unsupervised learning of structured and explainable representations that can support reasoning about objects and actions, including in surgical videos. While conventional object-centric methods for videos leverage recurrent processing to achieve efficiency, they often struggle with maintaining long-range temporal coherence required for long videos in surgical applications. On the other hand, fully parallel processing of entire videos enhances temporal consistency but introduces significant computational overhead, making it impractical for implementation on hardware in medical facilities. We present Slot-BERT, a bidirectional long-range model that learns object-centric representations in a latent space while ensuring robust temporal coherence. Slot-BERT scales object discovery seamlessly to long videos of unconstrained lengths. A novel slot contrastive loss further reduces redundancy and improves the representation disentanglement by enhancing slot orthogonality. We evaluate Slot-BERT on real-world surgical video datasets from abdominal, cholecystectomy, and thoracic procedures. Our method surpasses state-of-the-art object-centric approaches under unsupervised training achieving superior performance across diverse domains. We also demonstrate efficient zero-shot domain adaptation to data from diverse surgical specialties and databases.

Title: Scaling laws for decoding images from brain activity
Authors: Hubert Banville, Yohann Benchetrit, Stéphane d'Ascoli, Jérémy Rapin, Jean-Rémi King
Abstract: Generative AI has recently propelled the decoding of images from brain activity. How do these approaches scale with the amount and type of neural recordings? Here, we systematically compare image decoding from four types of non-invasive devices: electroencephalography (EEG), magnetoencephalography (MEG), high-field functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (3T fMRI) and ultra-high field (7T) fMRI. For this, we evaluate decoding models on the largest benchmark to date, encompassing 8 public datasets, 84 volunteers, 498 hours of brain recording and 2.3 million brain responses to natural images. Unlike previous work, we focus on single-trial decoding performance to simulate real-time settings. This systematic comparison reveals three main findings. First, the most precise neuroimaging devices tend to yield the best decoding performances, when the size of the training sets are similar. However, the gain enabled by deep learning - in comparison to linear models - is obtained with the noisiest devices. Second, we do not observe any plateau of decoding performance as the amount of training data increases. Rather, decoding performance scales log-linearly with the amount of brain recording. Third, this scaling law primarily depends on the amount of data per subject. However, little decoding gain is observed by increasing the number of subjects. Overall, these findings delineate the path most suitable to scale the decoding of images from non-invasive brain recordings.

Title: NeRAF: 3D Scene Infused Neural Radiance and Acoustic Fields
Authors: Amandine Brunetto, Sascha Hornauer, Fabien Moutarde
Abstract: Sound plays a major role in human perception. Along with vision, it provides essential information for understanding our surroundings. Despite advances in neural implicit representations, learning acoustics that align with visual scenes remains a challenge. We propose NeRAF, a method that jointly learns acoustic and radiance fields. NeRAF synthesizes both novel views and spatialized room impulse responses (RIR) at new positions by conditioning the acoustic field on 3D scene geometric and appearance priors from the radiance field. The generated RIR can be applied to auralize any audio signal. Each modality can be rendered independently and at spatially distinct positions, offering greater versatility. We demonstrate that NeRAF generates high-quality audio on SoundSpaces and RAF datasets, achieving significant performance improvements over prior methods while being more data-efficient. Additionally, NeRAF enhances novel view synthesis of complex scenes trained with sparse data through cross-modal learning. NeRAF is designed as a Nerfstudio module, providing convenient access to realistic audio-visual generation.

Title: Electroencephalogram Emotion Recognition via AUC Maximization
Authors: Minheng Xiao, Shi Bo
Abstract: Imbalanced datasets pose significant challenges in areas including neuroscience, cognitive science, and medical diagnostics, where accurately detecting minority classes is essential for robust model performance. This study addresses the issue of class imbalance, using the `Liking' label in the DEAP dataset as an example. Such imbalances are often overlooked by prior research, which typically focuses on the more balanced arousal and valence labels and predominantly uses accuracy metrics to measure model performance. To tackle this issue, we adopt numerical optimization techniques aimed at maximizing the area under the curve (AUC), thus enhancing the detection of underrepresented classes. Our approach, which begins with a linear classifier, is compared against traditional linear classifiers, including logistic regression and support vector machines (SVM). Our method significantly outperforms these models, increasing recall from 41.6\% to 79.7\% and improving the F1-score from 0.506 to 0.632. These results highlight the efficacy of AUC maximization via numerical optimization in managing imbalanced datasets, providing an effective solution for enhancing predictive accuracy in detecting minority but crucial classes in out-of-sample datasets.

Title: Bounds for Joint Detection and Decoding on the Binary-Input AWGN Channel
Authors: Simon Obermüller, Jannis Clausius, Marvin Geiselhart, Stephan ten Brink
Abstract: For asynchronous transmission of short blocks, preambles for packet detection contribute a non-negligible overhead. To reduce the required preamble length, joint detection and decoding (JDD) techniques have been proposed that additionally utilize the payload part of the packet for detection. In this paper, we analyze two instances of JDD, namely hybrid preamble and energy detection (HyPED) and decoder-aided detection (DAD). While HyPED combines the preamble with energy detection for the payload, DAD also uses the output of a channel decoder. For these systems, we propose novel achievability and converse bounds for the rates over the binary-input additive white Gaussian noise (BI-AWGN) channel. Moreover, we derive a general bound on the required blocklength for JDD. Both the theoretical bound and the simulation of practical codebooks show that the rate of DAD quickly approaches that of synchronous transmission.

Title: Audio-Visual Deepfake Detection With Local Temporal Inconsistencies
Authors: Marcella Astrid, Enjie Ghorbel, Djamila Aouada
Abstract: This paper proposes an audio-visual deepfake detection approach that aims to capture fine-grained temporal inconsistencies between audio and visual modalities. To achieve this, both architectural and data synthesis strategies are introduced. From an architectural perspective, a temporal distance map, coupled with an attention mechanism, is designed to capture these inconsistencies while minimizing the impact of irrelevant temporal subsequences. Moreover, we explore novel pseudo-fake generation techniques to synthesize local inconsistencies. Our approach is evaluated against state-of-the-art methods using the DFDC and FakeAVCeleb datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in detecting audio-visual deepfakes.

Title: Tessellated Linear Model for Age Prediction from Voice
Authors: Dareen Alharthi, Mahsa Zamani, Bhiksha Raj, Rita Singh
Abstract: Voice biometric tasks, such as age estimation require modeling the often complex relationship between voice features and the biometric variable. While deep learning models can handle such complexity, they typically require large amounts of accurately labeled data to perform well. Such data are often scarce for biometric tasks such as voice-based age prediction. On the other hand, simpler models like linear regression can work with smaller datasets but often fail to generalize to the underlying non-linear patterns present in the data. In this paper we propose the Tessellated Linear Model (TLM), a piecewise linear approach that combines the simplicity of linear models with the capacity of non-linear functions. TLM tessellates the feature space into convex regions and fits a linear model within each region. We optimize the tessellation and the linear models using a hierarchical greedy partitioning. We evaluated TLM on the TIMIT dataset on the task of age prediction from voice, where it outperformed state-of-the-art deep learning models.

Title: Achievable DoF Bounds for Cache-Aided Asymmetric MIMO Communications
Authors: Mohammad NaseriTehrani, MohammadJavad Salehi, Antti Tölli
Abstract: Integrating coded caching (CC) into multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communications can significantly enhance the achievable degrees of freedom (DoF) in wireless networks. This paper investigates a practical cache-aided asymmetric MIMO configuration with cache ratio $\gamma$, where a server equipped with $L$ transmit antennas communicates with $K$ users, each having $G_k$ receive antennas. We propose three content-aware MIMO-CC strategies: the \emph{min-G} scheme, which treats the system as symmetric by assuming all users have the same number of antennas, equal to the smallest among them; the \emph{Grouping} scheme, which maximizes spatial multiplexing gain separately within each user subset at the cost of some global caching gain; and the \emph{Phantom} scheme, which dynamically redistributes spatial resources using virtual or ``phantom'' antennas at the users, bridging the performance gains of the min-$G$ and Grouping schemes. These strategies jointly optimize the number of users, $\Omega$, and the parallel streams decoded by each user, $\beta_k$, ensuring linear decodability for all target users. Analytical and numerical results confirm that the proposed schemes achieve significant DoF improvements across various system configurations.

Title: Representation Learning with Parameterised Quantum Circuits for Advancing Speech Emotion Recognition
Authors: Thejan Rajapakshe, Rajib Rana, Farina Riaz, Sara Khalifa, Björn W. Schuller
Abstract: Speech Emotion Recognition (SER) is a complex and challenging task in human-computer interaction due to the intricate dependencies of features and the overlapping nature of emotional expressions conveyed through speech. Although traditional deep learning methods have shown effectiveness, they often struggle to capture subtle emotional variations and overlapping states. This paper introduces a hybrid classical-quantum framework that integrates Parameterised Quantum Circuits (PQCs) with conventional Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) architectures. By leveraging quantum properties such as superposition and entanglement, the proposed model enhances feature representation and captures complex dependencies more effectively than classical methods. Experimental evaluations conducted on benchmark datasets, including IEMOCAP, RECOLA, and MSP-Improv, demonstrate that the hybrid model achieves higher accuracy in both binary and multi-class emotion classification while significantly reducing the number of trainable parameters. While a few existing studies have explored the feasibility of using Quantum Circuits to reduce model complexity, none have successfully shown how they can enhance accuracy. This study is the first to demonstrate that Quantum Circuits has the potential to improve the accuracy of SER. The findings highlight the promise of QML to transform SER, suggesting a promising direction for future research and practical applications in emotion-aware systems.
