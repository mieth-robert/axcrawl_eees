Title: Diagnosis of Pulmonary Hypertension by Integrating Multimodal Data with a Hybrid Graph Convolutional and Transformer Network
Authors: Fubao Zhu, Yang Zhang, Gengmin Liang, Jiaofen Nan, Yanting Li, Chuang Han, Danyang Sun, Zhiguo Wang, Chen Zhao, Wenxuan Zhou, Jian He, Yi Xu, Iokfai Cheang, Xu Zhu, Yanli Zhou, Weihua Zhou
Abstract: Early and accurate diagnosis of pulmonary hypertension (PH) is essential for optimal patient management. Differentiating between pre-capillary and post-capillary PH is critical for guiding treatment decisions. This study develops and validates a deep learning-based diagnostic model for PH, designed to classify patients as non-PH, pre-capillary PH, or post-capillary PH. This retrospective study analyzed data from 204 patients (112 with pre-capillary PH, 32 with post-capillary PH, and 60 non-PH controls) at the First Affiliated Hospital of Nanjing Medical University. Diagnoses were confirmed through right heart catheterization. We selected 6 samples from each category for the test set (18 samples, 10%), with the remaining 186 samples used for the training set. This process was repeated 35 times for testing. This paper proposes a deep learning model that combines Graph convolutional networks (GCN), Convolutional neural networks (CNN), and Transformers. The model was developed to process multimodal data, including short-axis (SAX) sequences, four-chamber (4CH) sequences, and clinical parameters. Our model achieved a performance of Area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC) = 0.81 +- 0.06(standard deviation) and Accuracy (ACC) = 0.73 +- 0.06 on the test set. The discriminative abilities were as follows: non-PH subjects (AUC = 0.74 +- 0.11), pre-capillary PH (AUC = 0.86 +- 0.06), and post-capillary PH (AUC = 0.83 +- 0.10). It has the potential to support clinical decision-making by effectively integrating multimodal data to assist physicians in making accurate and timely diagnoses.

Title: Novel sparse PCA method via Runge Kutta numerical method(s) for face recognition
Authors: Loc Hoang Tran, Luong Anh Tuan Nguyen
Abstract: Face recognition is a crucial topic in data science and biometric security, with applications spanning military, finance, and retail industries. This paper explores the implementation of sparse Principal Component Analysis (PCA) using the Proximal Gradient method (also known as ISTA) and the Runge-Kutta numerical methods. To address the face recognition problem, we integrate sparse PCA with either the k-nearest neighbor method or the kernel ridge regression method. Experimental results demonstrate that combining sparse PCA-solved via the Proximal Gradient method or the Runge-Kutta numerical approach-with a classification system yields higher accuracy compared to standard PCA. Additionally, we observe that the Runge-Kutta-based sparse PCA computation consistently outperforms the Proximal Gradient method in terms of speed.

Title: An Integrated AI-Enabled System Using One Class Twin Cross Learning (OCT-X) for Early Gastric Cancer Detection
Authors: Xian-Xian Liu, Yuanyuan Wei, Mingkun Xu, Yongze Guo, Hongwei Zhang, Huicong Dong, Qun Song, Qi Zhao, Wei Luo, Feng Tien, Juntao Gao, Simon Fong
Abstract: Early detection of gastric cancer, a leading cause of cancer-related mortality worldwide, remains hampered by the limitations of current diagnostic technologies, leading to high rates of misdiagnosis and missed diagnoses. To address these challenges, we propose an integrated system that synergizes advanced hardware and software technologies to balance speed-accuracy. Our study introduces the One Class Twin Cross Learning (OCT-X) algorithm. Leveraging a novel fast double-threshold grid search strategy (FDT-GS) and a patch-based deep fully convolutional network, OCT-X maximizes diagnostic accuracy through real-time data processing and seamless lesion surveillance. The hardware component includes an all-in-one point-of-care testing (POCT) device with high-resolution imaging sensors, real-time data processing, and wireless connectivity, facilitated by the NI CompactDAQ and LabVIEW software. Our integrated system achieved an unprecedented diagnostic accuracy of 99.70%, significantly outperforming existing models by up to 4.47%, and demonstrated a 10% improvement in multirate adaptability. These findings underscore the potential of OCT-X as well as the integrated system in clinical diagnostics, offering a path toward more accurate, efficient, and less invasive early gastric cancer detection. Future research will explore broader applications, further advancing oncological diagnostics. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: LQR based $Ï‰-$stabilization of a heat equation with memory
Authors: Bhargav Pavan Kumar Sistla, Wasim Akram, Debanjana Mitra, Vivek Natarajan
Abstract: We consider a heat equation with memory which is defined on a bounded domain in $\mathbb{R}^d$ and is driven by $m$ control inputs acting on the interior of the domain. Our objective is to numerically construct a state feedback controller for this equation such that, for each initial state, the solution of the closed-loop system decays exponentially to zero with a decay rate larger than a given rate $\omega>0$, i.e. we want to solve the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. We first show that the spectrum of the state operator $A$ associated with this equation has an accumulation point at $-\omega_0<0$. Given a $\omega\in(0,\omega_0)$, we show that the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory is solvable provided certain verifiable conditions on the control operator $B$ associated with this equation hold. We then consider an appropriate LQR problem for the heat equation with memory. For each $n\in\mathbb{N}$, we construct finite-dimensional approximations $A_n$ and $B_n$ of $A$ and $B$, respectively, and then show that by solving a corresponding approximation of the LQR problem a feedback operator $K_n$ can be computed such that all the eigenvalues of $A_n + B_n K_n$ have real part less than $-\omega$. We prove that $K_n$ for $n$ sufficiently large solves the $\omega$-stabilization problem for the heat equation with memory. A crucial and nontrivial step in our proof is establishing the uniform (in $n$) stabilizability of the pair $(A_n+\omega I, B_n)$. We have validated our theoretical results numerically using two examples: an 1D example on a unit interval and a 2D example on a square domain.

Title: Incompressible Optimal Transport and Applications in Fluid Mixing
Authors: Max Emerick, Bassam Bamieh
Abstract: The problem of incompressible fluid mixing arises in numerous engineering applications and has been well-studied over the years, yet many open questions remain. This paper aims to address the question "what do efficient flow fields for mixing look like, and how do they behave?" We approach this question by developing a framework which is inspired by the dynamic and geometric approach to optimal mass transport. Specifically, we formulate the fluid mixing problem as an optimal control problem where the dynamics are given by the continuity equation together with an incompressibility constraint. We show that within this framework, the set of reachable fluid configurations can formally be endowed with the structure of an infinite-dimensional Riemannian manifold, with a metric which is induced by the control effort, and that flow fields which are maximally efficient at mixing correspond to geodesics in this Riemannian space.

Title: General Framework for Array Noise Analysis and Noise Performance of a Two-Element Interferometer With a Mutual-Coupling Canceler
Authors: Leonid Belostotski, Adrian T. Sutinjo, Ravi Subrahmanyan, Soumyajit Mandal, Arjuna Madanayake
Abstract: This article investigates the noise performance of a two-element phased array and interferometer containing a recently introduced self-interference canceler, which in the context of this work acts as a mutual-coupling canceler. To this end, a general framework is proposed to permit noise analysis of this network and a large variety of other networks. The framework-based numerical analysis for a two-element-phased array shows that the addition of the canceler significantly increases the beam-equivalent noise temperature. For a two-element interferometer used in cosmology, this increase in noise temperature is still acceptable as the sky noise temperature in the 20-to-200 MHz band is high. When used in an interferometer, the canceler provides the ability to null mutual coherence at the interferometer output. The ability to provide matching to reduce the sensitivity of the null in mutual coherence to the phase of the 90deg hybrids in the canceler is discussed.

Title: Long-Range Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver Control of Satellite using Cross-Feedback Sliding Mode Controller
Authors: Vedant Vivek Kini, Dantu Phani Surya, Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: Satellite rendezvous and docking (RvD) maneuvers are essential for satellite servicing and in-orbit assembly. Traditional approaches often treat translational and rotational motions independently, simplifying control design but potentially leading to inefficiencies in maneuver time and fuel consumption. To address these challenges, a novel cross-feedback sliding mode controller has been proposed, developing an interdependent regulation system for translational and rotational motion. This method decouples the relative translational and rotational motion of chaser satellite with respect to target satellite while incorporating cross-feedback mechanisms to account for their inherent coupling. By incorporating rotational state information into translational control laws and vice versa, the approach ensures coordinated adjustments, enhancing maneuver efficiency. The chaser satellite manages both translational and rotational adjustments to rendezvous and dock with the target satellite. The stability of the cross-feedback sliding mode controller is established within the Lyapunov framework, and simulation results substantiate the effectiveness of this strategy.

Title: Lightweight Deep Models for Dermatological Disease Detection: A Study on Instance Selection and Channel Optimization
Authors: Ian Mateos Gonzalez, Estefani Jaramilla Nava, Abraham SÃ¡nchez Morales, JesÃºs GarcÃ­a-RamÃ­rez, Ricardo Ramos-Aguilar
Abstract: The identification of dermatological disease is an important problem in Mexico according with different studies. Several works in literature use the datasets of different repositories without applying a study of the data behavior, especially in medical images domain. In this work, we propose a methodology to preprocess dermaMNIST dataset in order to improve its quality for the classification stage, where we use lightweight convolutional neural networks. In our results, we reduce the number of instances for the neural network training obtaining a similar performance of models as ResNet.

Title: An Adaptive Control Approach to Treatment Selection for Substance Use Disorders
Authors: Eric Pulick, Yonatan Mintz
Abstract: Despite the massive costs and widespread harms of substance use, most individuals with substance use disorders (SUDs) receive no treatment at all. Digital therapeutics platforms are an emerging low-cost and low-barrier means of extending treatment to those who need it. While there is a growing body of research focused on how treatment providers can identify which patients need SUD support (or when they need it), there is very little work that addresses how providers should select treatments that are most appropriate for a given patient. Because SUD treatment involves months or years of voluntary compliance from the patient, treatment adherence is a critical consideration for the treatment provider. In this paper we focus on algorithms that a treatment provider can use to match the burden-level of proposed treatments to the time-varying engagement state of the patient to promote adherence. We propose structured models for a patient's engagement over time and their treatment adherence decisions. Using these models we pose a stochastic control formulation of the treatment-provider's burden selection problem. We propose an adaptive control approach that estimates unknown patient parameters as new data are observed. We show that these estimates are consistent and propose algorithms that use these estimates to make appropriate treatment recommendations.

Title: A Retina-Inspired Pathway to Real-Time Motion Prediction inside Image Sensors for Extreme-Edge Intelligence
Authors: Subhradip Chakraborty, Shay Snyder, Md Abdullah-Al Kaiser, Maryam Parsa, Gregory Schwartz, Akhilesh R. Jaiswal
Abstract: The ability to predict motion in real time is fundamental to many maneuvering activities in animals, particularly those critical for survival, such as attack and escape responses. Given its significance, it is no surprise that motion prediction in animals begins in the retina. Similarly, autonomous systems utilizing computer vision could greatly benefit from the capability to predict motion in real time. Therefore, for computer vision applications, motion prediction should be integrated directly at the camera pixel level. Towards that end, we present a retina-inspired neuromorphic framework capable of performing real-time, energy-efficient MP directly within camera pixels. Our hardware-algorithm framework, implemented using GlobalFoundries 22nm FDSOI technology, integrates key retinal MP compute blocks, including a biphasic filter, spike adder, nonlinear circuit, and a 2D array for multi-directional motion prediction. Additionally, integrating the sensor and MP compute die using a 3D Cu-Cu hybrid bonding approach improves design compactness by minimizing area usage and simplifying routing complexity. Validated on real-world object stimuli, the model delivers efficient, low-latency MP for decision-making scenarios reliant on predictive visual computation, while consuming only 18.56 pJ/MP in our mixed-signal hardware implementation.

Title: Model-Predictive Planning and Airspeed Regulation to Minimize Flight Energy Consumption
Authors: Trevor Karpinski, Alexander Blakesley, Jakub Krol, Bani Anvari, George Gorospe, Liang Sun
Abstract: Although battery technology has advanced tremendously over the past decade, it continues to be a bottleneck for the mass adoption of electric aircraft in long-haul cargo and passenger delivery. The onboard energy is expected to be utilized in an efficient manner. Energy concumption modeling research offers increasingly accurate mathematical models, but there is scant research pertaining to real-time energy optimization at an operational level. Additionally, few publications include landing and take-off energy demands in their governing models. This work presents fundamental energy equations and proposes a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller. The proposed method demonstrates a unique approach to an energy consumption model that tracks real-time energy optimization along a predetermined path. The proposed PID controller was tested in simulation, and the results show its effectiveness and accuracy in driving the actual airspeed to converge to the optimal velocity without knowing the system dynamics. We also propose a model-predictive method to minimize the energy usage in landing and take-off by optimizing the flight trajectory.

Title: Low-Complexity Channel Estimation for RIS-Assisted ISAC System
Authors: Chen Zhen, Li Jianqing, Zhang Haijun, Zhang Wei
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC), assisted by reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has emerged as a breakthrough technology to improve the capacity and reliability of 6G wireless network. However, a significant challenge in RIS-ISAC systems is the acquisition of channel state information (CSI), largely due to co-channel interference, which hinders meeting the required reliability standards. To address this issue, a minimax-concave penalty (MCP)-based CSI refinement scheme is proposed. This approach utilizes an element-grouping strategy to jointly estimate the ISAC channel and the RIS phase shift matrix. Unlike previous methods, our scheme exploits the inherent sparsity in RIS-assisted ISAC channels to reduce training overhead, and the near-optimal solution is derived for our studied RIS-ISAC scheme. The effectiveness of the element-grouping strategy is validated through simulation experiments, demonstrating superior channel estimation results when compared to existing benchmarks.

Title: Reconfigurable Codebook-Based Beamforming for RDARS-Aided mmWave MU-MIMO Systems
Authors: Chengwang Ji, Qing Xue, Haiquan Lu, Jintao Wang, Qiaoyan Peng, Shaodan Ma, Wei Zhang
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a new architecture for the sixth-generation (6G) millimeter wave (mmWave) communications. In RDARS-aided mmWave systems, the active and passive beamforming design and working mode configuration for reconfigurable elements are crucial for system performance. In this paper, we aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) in the RDARS-aided mmWave system. To take advantage of RDARS, we first design a reconfigurable codebook (RCB) in which the number and dimension of the codeword can be flexibly adjusted. Then, a low overhead beam training scheme based on hierarchical search is proposed. Accordingly, the active and passive beamforming for data transmission is designed to achieve the maximum WSR for both space-division multiple access (SDMA) and time-division multiple access (TDMA) schemes. For the TDMA scheme, the optimal number of RDARS transmit elements and the allocated power budget for WSR maximization are derived in closed form. Besides, the superiority of the RDARS is verified and the conditions under which RDARS outperforms RIS and DAS are given. For the SDMA scheme, we characterize the relationship between the number of RDARS connected elements and the user distribution, followed by the derivation of the optimal placement positions of the RDARS transmit elements. High-quality beamforming design solutions are derived to minimize the inter-user interference (IUI) at the base station and RDARS side respectively, which nearly leads to the maximal WSR. Finally, simulation results confirm our theoretical findings and the superiority of the proposed schemes.

Title: IRS Assisted Decentralized Learning for Wideband Spectrum Sensing
Authors: Sicheng Liu, Qun Wang, Zhuwei Qin, Weishan Zhang, Jingyi Wang, Xiang Ma
Abstract: The increasing demand for reliable connectivity in industrial environments necessitates effective spectrum utilization strategies, especially in the context of shared spectrum bands. However, the dynamic spectrum-sharing mechanisms often lead to significant interference and critical failures, creating a trade-off between spectrum scarcity and under-utilization. This paper addresses these challenges by proposing a novel Intelligent Reflecting Surface (IRS)-assisted spectrum sensing framework integrated with decentralized deep learning. The proposed model overcomes partial observation constraints and minimizes communication overhead while leveraging IRS technology to enhance spectrum sensing accuracy. Through comprehensive simulations, the framework demonstrates its ability to monitor wideband spectrum occupancy effectively, even under challenging signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) conditions. This approach offers a scalable and robust solution for spectrum management in next-generation wireless networks.

Abstract: We propose a pre-compensation scheme for bandwidth limitation and fiber dispersion (pre-BL-EDC) based on the modified Gerchberg-Saxton (GS) algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate 1.0/1.0/2.0 dB gains compared to modified GS pre-EDC for 20/28/32 Gbit/s bandwidth-limited systems.

Title: Spatial-Filter-Bank-Based Neural Method for Multichannel Speech Enhancement
Authors: Tianqin Zheng, Jilu Jin, Hanchen Pei, Gongping Huang, Jingdong Chen, Jacob Benesty
Abstract: The performance of deep learning-based multi-channel speech enhancement methods often deteriorates when the geometric parameters of the microphone array change. Traditional approaches to mitigate this issue typically involve training on multiple microphone arrays, which can be costly. To address this challenge, we focus on uniform circular arrays and propose the use of a spatial filter bank to extract features that are approximately invariant to geometric parameters. These features are then processed by a two-stage conformer-based model (TSCBM) to enhance speech quality. Experimental results demonstrate that our proposed method can be trained on a fixed microphone array while maintaining effective performance across uniform circular arrays with unseen geometric configurations during applications.

Title: Navigating the Uncharted Waters: A Gradual Approach to the Certification and Integration of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) in Global Maritime Operations
Authors: Hany M. Arnaoot
Abstract: The integration of Maritime Autonomous Surface Ships (MASS) into global maritime operations represents a transformative shift in the shipping industry, promising enhanced safety, efficiency, and cost-effectiveness. However, the widespread adoption of autonomous ships necessitates a robust regulatory framework and rigorous certification processes to address the unique challenges posed by these advanced technologies. This paper proposes a gradual, multi-stage approach to the certification and integration of MASS, beginning with small-scale trials in controlled environments and progressing to large-scale international operations. Key considerations include the development of reliable control systems, cybersecurity measures, sensor technologies, and redundancy mechanisms to ensure safe and efficient navigation. Additionally, the paper explores the economic and environmental implications of autonomous shipping, as well as the evolving legal frameworks for liability and compensation in the event of collisions. By adopting a cautious and methodical approach, the maritime industry can mitigate risks and pave the way for the safe and sustainable integration of autonomous ships into global trade.

Title: Dynamic Incentive Strategies for Smart EV Charging Stations: An LLM-Driven User Digital Twin Approach
Authors: Yichen Sun, Chenggang Cui, Chuanlin Zhang, Chunyang Gong
Abstract: This paper presents an enhanced electric vehicle demand response system based on large language models, aimed at optimizing the application of vehicle-to-grid technology. By leveraging an large language models-driven multi-agent framework to construct user digital twins integrated with multidimensional user profile features, it enables deep simulation and precise prediction of users' charging and discharging decision-making patterns. Additionally, a data- and knowledge-driven dynamic incentive mechanism is proposed, combining a distributed optimization model under network constraints to optimize the grid-user interaction while ensuring both economic viability and security. Simulation results demonstrate that the approach significantly improves load peak-valley regulation and charging/discharging strategies. Experimental validation highlights the system's substantial advantages in load balancing, user satisfaction and grid stability, providing decision-makers with a scalable V2G management tool that promotes the sustainable, synergistic development of vehicle-grid integration.

Title: Behavioral Inequalities
Authors: Soutrik Bandyopadhyay, Debasattam Pal, Shubhendu Bhasin
Abstract: We introduce behavioral inequalities as a way to model dynamical systems defined by inequalities among their variables of interest. We claim that such a formulation enables the representation of safety-aware dynamical systems, systems with bounds on disturbances, practical design limits and operational boundaries, etc. We develop a necessary and sufficient condition for the existence of solutions to such behavioral inequalities and provide a parametrization of solutions when they exist. Finally, we show the efficacy of the proposed method in two practical examples.

Abstract: Achieving more powerful semantic representations and semantic understanding is one of the key problems in improving the performance of semantic communication systems. This work focuses on enhancing the semantic understanding of the text data to improve the effectiveness of semantic exchange. We propose a novel semantic communication system for text transmission, in which the semantic understanding is enhanced by coarse-to-fine processing. Especially, a dual attention mechanism is proposed to capture both the coarse and fine semantic information. Numerical experiments show the proposed system outperforms the benchmarks in terms of bilingual evaluation, sentence similarity, and robustness under various channel conditions.

Title: Deep Graph Reinforcement Learning for UAV-Enabled Multi-User Secure Communications
Authors: Xiao Tang, Kexin Zhao, Chao Shen, Qinghe Du, Yichen Wang, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han
Abstract: While unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) with flexible mobility are envisioned to enhance physical layer security in wireless communications, the efficient security design that adapts to such high network dynamics is rather challenging. The conventional approaches extended from optimization perspectives are usually quite involved, especially when jointly considering factors in different scales such as deployment and transmission in UAV-related scenarios. In this paper, we address the UAV-enabled multi-user secure communications by proposing a deep graph reinforcement learning framework. Specifically, we reinterpret the security beamforming as a graph neural network (GNN) learning task, where mutual interference among users is managed through the message-passing mechanism. Then, the UAV deployment is obtained through soft actor-critic reinforcement learning, where the GNN-based security beamforming is exploited to guide the deployment strategy update. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed approach achieves near-optimal security performance and significantly enhances the efficiency of strategy determination. Moreover, the deep graph reinforcement learning framework offers a scalable solution, adaptable to various network scenarios and configurations, establishing a robust basis for information security in UAV-enabled communications.

Title: A Novel Pilot Allocation Technique for Uplink OFDMA in ISAC Systems
Authors: Ahmet Sacid Sumer, Ebubekir Memisoglu, Huseyin Arslan
Abstract: In integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems, pilot signals play a crucial role in enhancing sensing performance due to their strong autocorrelation properties and high transmission power. However, conventional interleaved pilots inherently constrain the maximum unambiguous range and reduce the accuracy of channel impulse response (CIR) estimation compared to continuous orthogonal frequency-division multiple access (OFDMA) signals. To address this challenge, we propose a novel overlapped block-pilot structure for uplink OFDMA-based ISAC systems, called phase-shifted ISAC (PS-ISAC) pilot allocation. The proposed method leverages a cyclic prefix (CP)-based phase-shifted pilot design, enabling efficient multi-transmitter pilot separation at the receiver. Simulation results confirm that the proposed scheme enhances CIR separation, reduces computational complexity, and improves mean square error (MSE) performance under practical power constraints. Furthermore, we demonstrate that utilizing continuous pilot resources maximizes the unambiguous range.

Title: STPNet: Scale-aware Text Prompt Network for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Dandan Shan, Zihan Li, Yunxiang Li, Qingde Li, Jie Tian, Qingqi Hong
Abstract: Accurate segmentation of lesions plays a critical role in medical image analysis and diagnosis. Traditional segmentation approaches that rely solely on visual features often struggle with the inherent uncertainty in lesion distribution and size. To address these issues, we propose STPNet, a Scale-aware Text Prompt Network that leverages vision-language modeling to enhance medical image segmentation. Our approach utilizes multi-scale textual descriptions to guide lesion localization and employs retrieval-segmentation joint learning to bridge the semantic gap between visual and linguistic modalities. Crucially, STPNet retrieves relevant textual information from a specialized medical text repository during training, eliminating the need for text input during inference while retaining the benefits of cross-modal learning. We evaluate STPNet on three datasets: COVID-Xray, COVID-CT, and Kvasir-SEG. Experimental results show that our vision-language approach outperforms state-of-the-art segmentation methods, demonstrating the effectiveness of incorporating textual semantic knowledge into medical image analysis.

Title: Instance Migration Diffusion for Nuclear Instance Segmentation in Pathology
Authors: Lirui Qi, Hongliang He, Tong Wang, Siwei Feng, Guohong Fu
Abstract: Nuclear instance segmentation plays a vital role in disease diagnosis within digital pathology. However, limited labeled data in pathological images restricts the overall performance of nuclear instance segmentation. To tackle this challenge, we propose a novel data augmentation framework Instance Migration Diffusion Model (IM-Diffusion), IM-Diffusion designed to generate more varied pathological images by constructing diverse nuclear layouts and internuclear spatial relationships. In detail, we introduce a Nuclear Migration Module (NMM) which constructs diverse nuclear layouts by simulating the process of nuclear migration. Building on this, we further present an Internuclear-regions Inpainting Module (IIM) to generate diverse internuclear spatial relationships by structure-aware inpainting. On the basis of the above, IM-Diffusion generates more diverse pathological images with different layouts and internuclear spatial relationships, thereby facilitating downstream tasks. Evaluation on the CoNSeP and GLySAC datasets demonstrate that the images generated by IM-Diffusion effectively enhance overall instance segmentation performance. Code will be made public later.

Title: Nonlinear Bandwidth and Bode Diagrams based on Scaled Relative Graphs
Authors: Julius P.J. Krebbekx, Roland TÃ³th, Amritam Das
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a novel graphical frequency domain method for the analysis of nonlinear systems. In this paper, we use the restriction of the SRG to particular input spaces to compute frequency-dependent gain bounds for incrementally stable nonlinear systems. This leads to a nonlinear (NL) generalization of the Bode diagram, where the sinusoidal, harmonic, and subharmonic inputs are considered separately. When applied to the analysis of the NL loop transfer and sensitivity, we define a notion of bandwidth for both the open-loop and closed-loop, compatible with the LTI definitions. We illustrate the power of our method on the analysis of a DC motor with a parasitic nonlinearity, verifying our results in simulations.

Title: Frequency-Domain Bounds for the Multiconductor Telegrapher's Equation
Authors: Daniel Selvaratnam, Alessio Moreschini, Amritam Das, Thomas Parisini, Henrik Sandberg
Abstract: We establish mathematical bounds on the chain, ABCD and immittance matrices of a multiconductor transmission line, based on the Telegrapher's equation. Closed-form expressions for those matrices are also presented. Existing results that hold on the imaginary axis are extended to the complex plane, without reliance on a simultaneous diagonalizability assumption that is ubiquitous in the literature. Therefore, the results remain valid even when line symmetry breaks down, as in the case of electrical faults. The system-theoretic properties established here are of general relevance to control, power systems, and signal processing involving multiconductor transmission lines.

Title: SpikeSift: A Computationally Efficient and Drift-Resilient Spike Sorting Algorithm
Authors: Vasileios Georgiadis, Panagiotis C. Petrantonakis
Abstract: Spike sorting is a fundamental step in analyzing extracellular recordings, enabling the isolation of individual neuronal activity, yet it remains a challenging problem due to overlapping signals and recording instabilities, including electrode drift. While numerous algorithms have been developed to address these challenges, many struggle to balance accuracy and computational efficiency, limiting their applicability to largescale datasets. In response, we introduce SpikeSift, a novel spike sorting algorithm designed to mitigate drift by partitioning recordings into short, relatively stationary segments, with spikes subsequently sorted within each. To preserve neuronal identity across segment boundaries, a computationally efficient alignment process merges clusters without relying on continuous trajectory estimation. In contrast to conventional methods that separate spike detection from clustering, SpikeSift integrates these processes within an iterative detect-andsubtract framework, enhancing clustering accuracy while maintaining computational efficiency. Evaluations on intracellularly validated datasets and biophysically realistic MEArec simulations confirm that SpikeSift maintains high sorting accuracy even in the presence of electrode drift, providing a scalable and computationally efficient solution for large-scale extracellular recordings

Title: Convex Computations for Controlled Safety Invariant Sets of Black-box Discrete-time Dynamical Systems
Authors: Taoran Wu, Yiling Xue, Jingduo Pan, Dejin Ren, Arvind Easwaran, Bai Xue
Abstract: Identifying controlled safety invariant sets (CSISs) is essential in safety-critical applications. This paper tackles the problem of identifying CSISs for black-box discrete-time systems, where the model is unknown and only limited simulation data is accessible. Traditionally, a CSIS is defined as a subset of a safe set, encompassing initial states for which a control input exists that keeps the system within the set at the next time step-this is referred to as the one-step invariance property. However, the requirement for one-step invariance can be equivalently translated into a stricter condition of ``always-invariance'', meaning that there exist control inputs capable of keeping the system within this set indefinitely. Such a condition may prove overly stringent or impractical for black-box systems, where predictions can become unreliable beyond a single time step or a limited number of finite time steps. To overcome the challenges posed by black-box systems, we reformulate the one-step invariance property in a ``Probably Approximately Correct'' (PAC) sense. This approach allows us to assess the probability that a control input exists to keep the system within the CSIS at the next time step, with a predefined level of confidence. If the system successfully remains within the set at the next time step, we can then reapply the invariance evaluation to the new state, thereby facilitating a recursive assurance of invariance. Our method employs barrier functions and scenario optimization, resulting in a linear programming method to estimate PAC CSISs. Finally, the effectiveness of our approach is demonstrated on several examples.

Title: Identification of additive multivariable continuous-time systems
Authors: Maarten van der Hulst, Rodrigo GonzÃ¡lez, Koen Classens, Nic Dirkx, Jeroen van de Wijdeven, Tom Oomen
Abstract: Multivariable parametric models are critical for designing, controlling, and optimizing the performance of engineered systems. The main objective of this paper is to develop a parametric identification strategy that delivers accurate and physically relevant models of multivariable systems using time-domain data. The introduced approach adopts an additive model structure, offering a parsimonious and interpretable representation of many physical systems, and employs a refined instrumental variable-based estimation algorithm. The developed identification method enables the estimation of parametric continuous-time additive models and is applicable to both open and closed-loop controlled systems. The performance of the estimator is demonstrated through numerical simulations and experimentally validated on a flexible beam system.

Title: Market-Oriented Flow Allocation for Thermal Solar Plants: An Auction-Based Methodology with Artificial Intelligence
Authors: Sara Ruiz-Moreno, Antonio J. Gallego, Antonio J. Gallego, Antonio J. Gallego
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method to optimize thermal balance in parabolic trough collector (PTC) plants. It uses a market-based system to distribute flow among loops combined with an artificial neural network (ANN) to reduce computation and data requirements. This auction-based approach balances loop temperatures, accommodating varying thermal losses and collector efficiencies. Validation across different thermal losses, optical efficiencies, and irradiance conditions-sunny, partially cloudy, and cloudy-show improved thermal power output and intercept factors compared to a no-allocation system. It demonstrates scalability and practicality for large solar thermal plants, enhancing overall performance. The method was first validated through simulations on a realistic solar plant model, then adapted and successfully tested in a 50 MW solar trough plant, demonstrating its advantages. Furthermore, the algorithms have been implemented, commissioned, and are currently operating in 13 commercial solar trough plants.

Title: System Level Synthesis for Affine Control Policies: Model Based and Data-Driven Settings
Authors: Lukas SchÃ¼epp, Giulia De Pasquale, Florian DÃ¶rfler, Carmen Amo Alonso
Abstract: There is an increasing need for effective control of systems with complex dynamics, particularly through data-driven approaches. System Level Synthesis (SLS) has emerged as a powerful framework that facilitates the control of large-scale systems while accounting for model uncertainties. SLS approaches are currently limited to linear systems and time-varying linear control policies, thus limiting the class of achievable control strategies. We introduce a novel closed-loop parameterization for time-varying affine control policies, extending the SLS framework to a broader class of systems and policies. We show that the closed-loop behavior under affine policies can be equivalently characterized using past system trajectories, enabling a fully data-driven formulation. This parameterization seamlessly integrates affine policies into optimal control problems, allowing for a closed-loop formulation of general Model Predictive Control (MPC) problems. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to extend SLS to affine policies in both model-based and data-driven settings, enabling an equivalent formulation of MPC problems using closed-loop maps. We validate our approach through numerical experiments, demonstrating that our model-based and data-driven affine SLS formulations achieve performance on par with traditional model-based MPC.

Title: Hidden Markov Model Filtering with Equal Exit Probabilities
Authors: Dongyan Sui, Haotian Pu, Siyang Leng, Stefan Vlaski
Abstract: Hidden Markov Models (HMMs) provide a rigorous framework for inference in dynamic environments. In this work, we study the alpha-HMM algorithm motivated by the optimal online filtering formulation in settings where the true state evolves as a Markov chain with equal exit probabilities. We quantify the dynamics of the algorithm in stationary environments, revealing a trade-off between inference and adaptation, showing how key parameters and the quality of observations affect performance. Comprehensive theoretical analysis on the nonlinear dynamical system that governs the evolution of the log-belief ratio over time and numerical experiments demonstrate that the proposed approach effectively balances adaptation and inference performance.

Title: Learning with Imperfect Models: When Multi-step Prediction Mitigates Compounding Error
Authors: Anne Somalwar, Bruce D. Lee, George J. Pappas, Nikolai Matni
Abstract: Compounding error, where small prediction mistakes accumulate over time, presents a major challenge in learning-based control. For example, this issue often limits the performance of model-based reinforcement learning and imitation learning. One common approach to mitigate compounding error is to train multi-step predictors directly, rather than relying on autoregressive rollout of a single-step model. However, it is not well understood when the benefits of multi-step prediction outweigh the added complexity of learning a more complicated model. In this work, we provide a rigorous analysis of this trade-off in the context of linear dynamical systems. We show that when the model class is well-specified and accurately captures the system dynamics, single-step models achieve lower asymptotic prediction error. On the other hand, when the model class is misspecified due to partial observability, direct multi-step predictors can significantly reduce bias and thus outperform single-step approaches. These theoretical results are supported by numerical experiments, wherein we also (a) empirically evaluate an intermediate strategy which trains a single-step model using a multi-step loss and (b) evaluate performance of single step and multi-step predictors in a closed loop control setting.

Title: Leveraging Embedding Techniques in Multimodal Machine Learning for Mental Illness Assessment
Authors: Abdelrahaman A. Hassan, Abdelrahman A. Ali, Aya E. Fouda, Radwa J. Hanafy, Mohammed E. Fouda
Abstract: The increasing global prevalence of mental disorders, such as depression and PTSD, requires objective and scalable diagnostic tools. Traditional clinical assessments often face limitations in accessibility, objectivity, and consistency. This paper investigates the potential of multimodal machine learning to address these challenges, leveraging the complementary information available in text, audio, and video data. Our approach involves a comprehensive analysis of various data preprocessing techniques, including novel chunking and utterance-based formatting strategies. We systematically evaluate a range of state-of-the-art embedding models for each modality and employ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Bidirectional LSTM Networks (BiLSTMs) for feature extraction. We explore data-level, feature-level, and decision-level fusion techniques, including a novel integration of Large Language Model (LLM) predictions. We also investigate the impact of replacing Multilayer Perceptron classifiers with Support Vector Machines. We extend our analysis to severity prediction using PHQ-8 and PCL-C scores and multi-class classification (considering co-occurring conditions). Our results demonstrate that utterance-based chunking significantly improves performance, particularly for text and audio modalities. Decision-level fusion, incorporating LLM predictions, achieves the highest accuracy, with a balanced accuracy of 94.8% for depression and 96.2% for PTSD detection. The combination of CNN-BiLSTM architectures with utterance-level chunking, coupled with the integration of external LLM, provides a powerful and nuanced approach to the detection and assessment of mental health conditions. Our findings highlight the potential of MMML for developing more accurate, accessible, and personalized mental healthcare tools.

Title: Quattro: Transformer-Accelerated Iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator Framework for Fast Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Yue Wang, Hoayu Wang, Zhaoxing Li
Abstract: Real-time optimal control remains a fundamental challenge in robotics, especially for nonlinear systems with stringent performance requirements. As one of the representative trajectory optimization algorithms, the iterative Linear Quadratic Regulator (iLQR) faces limitations due to their inherently sequential computational nature, which restricts the efficiency and applicability of real-time control for robotic systems. While existing parallel implementations aim to overcome the above limitations, they typically demand additional computational iterations and high-performance hardware, leading to only modest practical improvements. In this paper, we introduce Quattro, a transformer-accelerated iLQR framework employing an algorithm-hardware co-design strategy to predict intermediate feedback and feedforward matrices. It facilitates effective parallel computations on resource-constrained devices without sacrificing accuracy. Experiments on cart-pole and quadrotor systems show an algorithm-level acceleration of up to 5.3$\times$ and 27$\times$ per iteration, respectively. When integrated into a Model Predictive Control (MPC) framework, Quattro achieves overall speedups of 2.8$\times$ for the cart-pole and 17.8$\times$ for the quadrotor compared to the one that applies traditional iLQR. Transformer inference is deployed on FPGA to maximize performance, achieving up to 27.3$\times$ speedup over commonly used computing devices, with around 2 to 4$\times$ power reduction and acceptable hardware overhead.

Title: Barrier Certificates for Unknown Systems with Latent States and Polynomial Dynamics using Bayesian Inference
Authors: Robert Lefringhausen, Sami Leon Noel Aziz Hanna, Elias August, Sandra Hirche
Abstract: Certifying safety in dynamical systems is crucial, but barrier certificates - widely used to verify that system trajectories remain within a safe region - typically require explicit system models. When dynamics are unknown, data-driven methods can be used instead, yet obtaining a valid certificate requires rigorous uncertainty quantification. For this purpose, existing methods usually rely on full-state measurements, limiting their applicability. This paper proposes a novel approach for synthesizing barrier certificates for unknown systems with latent states and polynomial dynamics. A Bayesian framework is employed, where a prior in state-space representation is updated using input-output data via a targeted marginal Metropolis-Hastings sampler. The resulting samples are used to construct a candidate barrier certificate through a sum-of-squares program. It is shown that if the candidate satisfies the required conditions on a test set of additional samples, it is also valid for the true, unknown system with high probability. The approach and its probabilistic guarantees are illustrated through a numerical simulation.

Title: Non-collocated vibration absorption using delayed resonator for spectral and spacial tuning -- analysis and experimental validation
Authors: MatÄ›j KuÅ™e, Adam Peichl, Jaroslav BuÅ¡ek, Nejat Olgac, TomÃ¡Å¡ VyhlÃ­dal
Abstract: Non-collocated vibration absorption (NCVA) concept using delayed resonator for in-situ tuning is analyzed and experimentally validated. There are two critical contributions of this work. One is on the scalable analytical pathway for verifying the concept of resonant substructure as the basis of the ideal vibration absorption. The second is to experimentally validate the spatial and spectral tunability of NCVA structures for the first time. For both novelties arbitrarily large dimensions of interconnected mass-spring-damper chains are considered. Following the state of the art on NCVA, control synthesis is performed over the resonant substructure comprising the delayed resonator and a part of the primary structure involved in the vibration absorption. The experimental validation of the proposed NCVA concept is performed on a mechatronic setup with three interconnected cart-bodies. Based on the spectral analysis, an excitation frequency is selected for which a stable vibration suppression can be achieved sequentially for all the three bodies, one collocated and two non-collocated. The experimental results closely match the simulations for complete vibration suppression at the targeted bodies, and thus validating the crucial spatial tunability characteristic as well as the traditional spectral tuning.

Title: Antenna Selection for Enhancing Privacy in Radar-Based Vital Sign Monitoring Systems
Authors: Zhihao Tao, Athina P. Petropulu
Abstract: Radar-based vital sign monitoring (VSM) systems have become valuable for non-contact health monitoring by detecting physiological activities, such as respiration and heartbeat, remotely. However, the conventional phased array used in VSM is vulnerable to privacy breaches, as an eavesdropper can extract sensitive vital sign information by analyzing the reflected radar signals. In this paper, we propose a novel approach to protect privacy in radar-based VSM by modifying the radar transmitter hardware, specifically by strategically selecting the transmit antennas from the available antennas in the transmit array. By dynamically selecting which antennas connect or disconnect to the radio frequency chain, the transmitter introduces additional phase noise to the radar echoes, generating false frequencies in the power spectrum of the extracted phases at the eavesdropper's receiver. The antenna activation pattern is designed to maximize the variance of the phases introduced by antenna selection, which effectively makes the false frequencies dominate the spectrum, obscuring the actual vital sign frequencies. Meanwhile, the authorized receiver, having knowledge of the antenna selection pattern, can compensate for the phase noise and accurately extract the vital signs. Numerical experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in enhancing privacy while maintaining vital sign monitoring.

Title: Tunable Thresholds and Frequency Encoding in a Spiking NOD Controller
Authors: Ian Xul Belaustegui, Alessio Franci, Naomi Ehrich Leonard
Abstract: Spiking Nonlinear Opinion Dynamics (S-NOD) is an excitable decision-making model inspired by the spiking dynamics of neurons. S-NOD enables the design of agile decision-making that can rapidly switch between decision options in response to a changing environment. In S-NOD, decisions are represented by continuous time, yet discrete, opinion spikes. Here, we extend previous analysis of S-NOD and explore its potential as a nonlinear controller with a tunable balance between robustness and responsiveness. We identify and provide necessary conditions for the bifurcation that determines the onset of periodic opinion spiking. We leverage this analysis to characterize the tunability of the input-output threshold for opinion spiking as a function of the model basal sensitivity and the modulation of opinion spiking frequency as a function of input magnitude past threshold. We conclude with a discussion on S-NOD as a new neuromorphic control block and its extension to distributed spiking controllers.

Title: Laboratory evaluation of a wearable instrumented headband for rotational head kinematics measurement
Authors: Anu Tripathi, Yang Wan, Sushant Malave, Sheila Turcsanyi, Alice Lux Fawzi, Alison Brooks, Haneesh Kesari, Traci Snedden, Peter Ferrazzano, Christian Franck, Rika Carlsen
Abstract: Mild traumatic brain injuries (mTBI) are a highly prevalent condition with heterogeneous outcomes between individuals. A key factor governing brain tissue deformation and the risk of mTBI is the rotational kinematics of the head. Instrumented mouthguards are a widely accepted method for measuring rotational head motions, owing to their robust sensor-skull coupling. However, wearing mouthguards is not feasible in all situations, especially for long-term data collection. Therefore, alternative wearable devices are needed. In this study, we present an improved design and data processing scheme for an instrumented headband. Our instrumented headband utilizes an array of inertial measurement units (IMUs) and a new data-processing scheme based on continuous wavelet transforms to address sources of error in the IMU measurements. The headband performance was evaluated in the laboratory on an anthropomorphic test device, which was impacted with a soccer ball to replicate soccer heading. When comparing the measured peak rotational velocities (PRV) and peak rotational accelerations (PRA) between the reference sensors and the headband for impacts to the front of the head, the correlation coefficients (r) were 0.80 and 0.63, and the normalized root mean square error (NRMSE) values were 0.20 and 0.28, respectively. However, when considering all impact locations, r dropped to 0.42 and 0.34 and NRMSE increased to 0.5 and 0.41 for PRV and PRA, respectively. This new instrumented headband improves upon previous headband designs in reconstructing the rotational head kinematics resulting from frontal soccer ball impacts, providing a potential alternative to instrumented mouthguards.

Title: Denoising guarantees for optimized sampling schemes in compressed sensing
Authors: Yaniv Plan, Matthew S. Scott, Xia Sheng, Ozgur Yilmaz
Abstract: Compressed sensing with subsampled unitary matrices benefits from \emph{optimized} sampling schemes, which feature improved theoretical guarantees and empirical performance relative to uniform subsampling. We provide, in a first of its kind in compressed sensing, theoretical guarantees showing that the error caused by the measurement noise vanishes with an increasing number of measurements for optimized sampling schemes, assuming that the noise is Gaussian. We moreover provide similar guarantees for measurements sampled with-replacement with arbitrary probability weights. All our results hold on prior sets contained in a union of low-dimensional subspaces. Finally, we demonstrate that this denoising behavior appears in empirical experiments with a rate that closely matches our theoretical guarantees when the prior set is the range of a generative ReLU neural network and when it is the set of sparse vectors.

Abstract: We introduce ShieldGemma 2, a 4B parameter image content moderation model built on Gemma 3. This model provides robust safety risk predictions across the following key harm categories: Sexually Explicit, Violence \& Gore, and Dangerous Content for synthetic images (e.g. output of any image generation model) and natural images (e.g. any image input to a Vision-Language Model). We evaluated on both internal and external benchmarks to demonstrate state-of-the-art performance compared to LlavaGuard \citep{helff2024llavaguard}, GPT-4o mini \citep{hurst2024gpt}, and the base Gemma 3 model \citep{gemma_2025} based on our policies. Additionally, we present a novel adversarial data generation pipeline which enables a controlled, diverse, and robust image generation. ShieldGemma 2 provides an open image moderation tool to advance multimodal safety and responsible AI development.

Title: MPCritic: A plug-and-play MPC architecture for reinforcement learning
Authors: Nathan P. Lawrence, Thomas Banker, Ali Mesbah
Abstract: The reinforcement learning (RL) and model predictive control (MPC) communities have developed vast ecosystems of theoretical approaches and computational tools for solving optimal control problems. Given their conceptual similarities but differing strengths, there has been increasing interest in synergizing RL and MPC. However, existing approaches tend to be limited for various reasons, including computational cost of MPC in an RL algorithm and software hurdles towards seamless integration of MPC and RL tools. These challenges often result in the use of "simple" MPC schemes or RL algorithms, neglecting the state-of-the-art in both areas. This paper presents MPCritic, a machine learning-friendly architecture that interfaces seamlessly with MPC tools. MPCritic utilizes the loss landscape defined by a parameterized MPC problem, focusing on "soft" optimization over batched training steps; thereby updating the MPC parameters while avoiding costly minimization and parametric sensitivities. Since the MPC structure is preserved during training, an MPC agent can be readily used for online deployment, where robust constraint satisfaction is paramount. We demonstrate the versatility of MPCritic, in terms of MPC architectures and RL algorithms that it can accommodate, on classic control benchmarks.

Title: Extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics for Bipedal Walking of the Knee-less Robot SLIDER
Authors: Rui Zong, Martin Liang, Yuntian Fang, Ke Wang, Xiaoshuai Chen, Wei Chen, Petar Kormushev
Abstract: Knee-less bipedal robots like SLIDER have the advantage of ultra-lightweight legs and improved walking energy efficiency compared to traditional humanoid robots. In this paper, we firstly introduce an improved hardware design of the bipedal robot SLIDER with new line-feet and more optimized mass distribution which enables higher locomotion speeds. Secondly, we propose an extended Hybrid Zero Dynamics (eHZD) method, which can be applied to prismatic joint robots like SLIDER. The eHZD method is then used to generate a library of gaits with varying reference velocities in an offline way. Thirdly, a Guided Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) algorithm is proposed to use the pre-generated library to create walking control policies in real-time. This approach allows us to combine the advantages of both HZD (for generating stable gaits with a full-dynamics model) and DRL (for real-time adaptive gait generation). The experimental results show that this approach achieves 150% higher walking velocity than the previous MPC-based approach.

Title: Value Iteration for Learning Concurrently Executable Robotic Control Tasks
Authors: Sheikh A. Tahmid, Gennaro Notomista
Abstract: Many modern robotic systems such as multi-robot systems and manipulators exhibit redundancy, a property owing to which they are capable of executing multiple tasks. This work proposes a novel method, based on the Reinforcement Learning (RL) paradigm, to train redundant robots to be able to execute multiple tasks concurrently. Our approach differs from typical multi-objective RL methods insofar as the learned tasks can be combined and executed in possibly time-varying prioritized stacks. We do so by first defining a notion of task independence between learned value functions. We then use our definition of task independence to propose a cost functional that encourages a policy, based on an approximated value function, to accomplish its control objective while minimally interfering with the execution of higher priority tasks. This allows us to train a set of control policies that can be executed simultaneously. We also introduce a version of fitted value iteration to learn to approximate our proposed cost functional efficiently. We demonstrate our approach on several scenarios and robotic systems.

Title: How to Maximize Efficiency in Systems with Exhausted Workers
Authors: Elif Beray Sariisik, Melih Bastopcu, Nail Akar, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We consider the problem of assigning tasks efficiently to a set of workers that can exhaust themselves as a result of processing tasks. If a worker is exhausted, it will take a longer time to recover. To model efficiency of workers with exhaustion, we use a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC). By taking samples from the internal states of the workers, the source assigns tasks to the workers when they are found to be in their efficient states. We consider two different settings where (i) the source can assign tasks to the workers only when they are in their most efficient state, and (ii) it can assign tasks to workers when they are also moderately efficient in spite of a potentially reduced success probability. In the former case, we find the optimal policy to be a threshold-based sampling policy where the thresholds depend on the workers' recovery and exhaustion rates. In the latter case, we solve a non-convex sum-of-ratios problem using a branch-and-bound approach which performs well compared with the globally optimal solution.

Title: R2DN: Scalable Parameterization of Contracting and Lipschitz Recurrent Deep Networks
Authors: Nicholas H. Barbara, Ruigang Wang, Ian R. Manchester
Abstract: This paper presents the Robust Recurrent Deep Network (R2DN), a scalable parameterization of robust recurrent neural networks for machine learning and data-driven control. We construct R2DNs as a feedback interconnection of a linear time-invariant system and a 1-Lipschitz deep feedforward network, and directly parameterize the weights so that our models are stable (contracting) and robust to small input perturbations (Lipschitz) by design. Our parameterization uses a structure similar to the previously-proposed recurrent equilibrium networks (RENs), but without the requirement to iteratively solve an equilibrium layer at each time-step. This speeds up model evaluation and backpropagation on GPUs, and makes it computationally feasible to scale up the network size, batch size, and input sequence length in comparison to RENs. We compare R2DNs to RENs on three representative problems in nonlinear system identification, observer design, and learning-based feedback control and find that training and inference are both up to an order of magnitude faster with similar test set performance, and that training/inference times scale more favorably with respect to model expressivity.

Title: The Social Life of Industrial Arms: How Arousal and Attention Shape Human-Robot Interaction
Authors: Roy El-Helou, Matthew K.X.J Pan
Abstract: This study explores how human perceptions of a non-anthropomorphic robotic manipulator are shaped by two key dimensions of behaviour: arousal, defined as the robot's movement energy and expressiveness, and attention, defined as the robot's capacity to selectively orient toward and engage with a user. We introduce a novel control architecture that integrates a gaze-like attention engine with an arousal-modulated motion system to generate socially meaningful behaviours. In a user study, we find that robots exhibiting high attention -- actively directing their focus toward users -- are perceived as warmer and more competent, intentional, and lifelike. In contrast, high arousal -- characterized by fast, expansive, and energetic motions -- increases perceptions of discomfort and disturbance. Importantly, a combination of focused attention and moderate arousal yields the highest ratings of trust and sociability, while excessive arousal diminishes social engagement. These findings offer design insights for endowing non-humanoid robots with expressive, intuitive behaviours that support more natural human-robot interaction.

Title: LOCO Codes Can Correct as Well: Error-Correction Constrained Coding for DNA Data Storage
Authors: Canberk Ä°rimaÄŸzÄ±, Ahmed Hareedy
Abstract: As a medium for cold data storage, DNA stands out as it promises significant gains in storage capacity and lifetime. However, it comes with its own data processing challenges to overcome. Constrained codes over the DNA alphabet $\{A,T,G,C\}$ have been used to design DNA sequences that are free of long homopolymers to increase stability, yet effective error detection and error correction are required to achieve reliability in data retrieval. Recently, we introduced lexicographically-ordered constrained (LOCO) codes, namely DNA LOCO (D-LOCO) codes, with error detection. In this paper, we equip our D-LOCO codes with error correction for substitution errors via syndrome-like decoding, designated as residue decoding. We only use D-LOCO codewords of indices divisible by a suitable redundancy metric $R(m) > 0$, where $m$ is the code length, for error correction. We provide the community with a construction of constrained codes forbidding runs of length higher than fixed $\ell \in \{1,2,3\}$ and $GC$-content in $\big [0.5-\frac{1}{2K},0.5+\frac{1}{2K}\big ]$ that correct $K$ segmented substitution errors, one per codeword. We call the proposed codes error-correction (EC) D-LOCO codes. We also give a list-decoding procedure with near-quadratic time-complexity in $m$ to correct double-substitution errors within EC D-LOCO codewords, which has $> 98.20\%$ average success rate. The redundancy metric is projected to require $2\log_2(m)+O(1)$-bit allocation for a length-$m$ codeword. Hence, our EC D-LOCO codes are projected to be capacity-approaching with respect to the error-free constrained system.

Title: AIM: Acoustic Inertial Measurement for Indoor Drone Localization and Tracking
Authors: Yimiao Sun, Weiguo Wang, Luca Mottola, Ruijin Wang, Yuan He
Abstract: We present Acoustic Inertial Measurement (AIM), a one-of-a-kind technique for indoor drone localization and tracking. Indoor drone localization and tracking are arguably a crucial, yet unsolved challenge: in GPS-denied environments, existing approaches enjoy limited applicability, especially in Non-Line of Sight (NLoS), require extensive environment instrumentation, or demand considerable hardware/software changes on drones. In contrast, AIM exploits the acoustic characteristics of the drones to estimate their location and derive their motion, even in NLoS settings. We tame location estimation errors using a dedicated Kalman filter and the Interquartile Range rule (IQR). We implement AIM using an off-the-shelf microphone array and evaluate its performance with a commercial drone under varied settings. Results indicate that the mean localization error of AIM is 46% lower than commercial UWB-based systems in complex indoor scenarios, where state-of-the-art infrared systems would not even work because of NLoS settings. We further demonstrate that AIM can be extended to support indoor spaces with arbitrary ranges and layouts without loss of accuracy by deploying distributed microphone arrays.

Title: Dual first-order methods for efficient computation of convex hull prices
Authors: Sofiane Tanji, Yassine Kamri, FranÃ§ois Glineur, Mehdi Madani
Abstract: Convex Hull (CH) pricing, used in US electricity markets and raising interest in Europe, is a pricing rule designed to handle markets with non-convexities such as startup costs and minimum up and down times. In such markets, the market operator makes side payments to generators to cover lost opportunity costs, and CH prices minimize the total "lost opportunity costs", which include both actual losses and missed profit opportunities. These prices can also be obtained by solving a (partial) Lagrangian dual of the original mixed-integer program, where power balance constraints are dualized. Computing CH prices then amounts to minimizing a sum of nonsmooth convex objective functions, where each term depends only on a single generator. The subgradient of each of those terms can be obtained independently by solving smaller mixed-integer programs. In this work, we benchmark a large panel of first-order methods to solve the above dual CH pricing problem. We test several dual methods, most of which not previously considered for CH pricing, namely a proximal variant of the bundle level method, subgradient methods with three different stepsize strategies, two recent parameter-free methods and an accelerated gradient method combined with smoothing. We compare those methods on two representative sets of real-world large-scale instances and complement the comparison with a (Dantzig-Wolfe) primal column generation method shown to be efficient at computing CH prices, for reference. Our numerical experiments show that the bundle proximal level method and two variants of the subgradient method perform the best among all dual methods and compare favorably with the Dantzig-Wolfe primal method.

Title: Chain of Correction for Full-text Speech Recognition with Large Language Models
Authors: Zhiyuan Tang, Dong Wang, Zhikai Zhou, Yong Liu, Shen Huang, Shidong Shang
Abstract: Full-text error correction with Large Language Models (LLMs) for Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) has gained increased attention due to its potential to correct errors across long contexts and address a broader spectrum of error types, including punctuation restoration and inverse text normalization. Nevertheless, many challenges persist, including issues related to stability, controllability, completeness, and fluency. To mitigate these challenges, this paper proposes the Chain of Correction (CoC) for full-text error correction with LLMs, which corrects errors segment by segment using pre-recognized text as guidance within a regular multi-turn chat format. The CoC also uses pre-recognized full text for context, allowing the model to better grasp global semantics and maintain a comprehensive overview of the entire content. Utilizing the open-sourced full-text error correction dataset ChFT, we fine-tune a pre-trained LLM to evaluate the performance of the CoC framework. Experimental results demonstrate that the CoC effectively corrects errors in full-text ASR outputs, significantly outperforming baseline and benchmark systems. We further analyze how to set the correction threshold to balance under-correction and over-rephrasing, extrapolate the CoC model on extremely long ASR outputs, and investigate whether other types of information can be employed to guide the error correction process.

Title: Satellite Edge Artificial Intelligence with Large Models: Architectures and Technologies
Authors: Yuanming Shi, Jingyang Zhu, Chunxiao Jiang, Linling Kuang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Driven by the growing demand for intelligent remote sensing applications, large artificial intelligence (AI) models pre-trained on large-scale unlabeled datasets and fine-tuned for downstream tasks have significantly improved learning performance for various downstream tasks due to their generalization capabilities. However, many specific downstream tasks, such as extreme weather nowcasting (e.g., downburst and tornado), disaster monitoring, and battlefield surveillance, require real-time data processing. Traditional methods via transferring raw data to ground stations for processing often cause significant issues in terms of latency and trustworthiness. To address these challenges, satellite edge AI provides a paradigm shift from ground-based to on-board data processing by leveraging the integrated communication-and-computation capabilities in space computing power networks (Space-CPN), thereby enhancing the timeliness, effectiveness, and trustworthiness for remote sensing downstream tasks. Moreover, satellite edge large AI model (LAM) involves both the training (i.e., fine-tuning) and inference phases, where a key challenge lies in developing computation task decomposition principles to support scalable LAM deployment in resource-constrained space networks with time-varying topologies. In this article, we first propose a satellite federated fine-tuning architecture to split and deploy the modules of LAM over space and ground networks for efficient LAM fine-tuning. We then introduce a microservice-empowered satellite edge LAM inference architecture that virtualizes LAM components into lightweight microservices tailored for multi-task multimodal inference. Finally, we discuss the future directions for enhancing the efficiency and scalability of satellite edge LAM, including task-oriented communication, brain-inspired computing, and satellite edge AI network optimization.

Title: An Adaptive Proximal Inexact Gradient Framework and Its Application to Per-Antenna Constrained Joint Beamforming and Compression Design
Authors: Xilai Fan, Bo Jiang, Ya-Feng Liu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an adaptive proximal inexact gradient (APIG) framework for solving a class of nonsmooth composite optimization problems involving function and gradient errors. Unlike existing inexact proximal gradient methods, the proposed framework introduces a new line search condition that jointly adapts to function and gradient errors, enabling adaptive stepsize selection while maintaining theoretical guarantees. Specifically, we prove that the proposed framework achieves an $\epsilon$-stationary point within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-2})$ iterations for nonconvex objectives and an $\epsilon$-optimal solution within $\mathcal{O}(\epsilon^{-1})$ iterations for convex cases, matching the best-known complexity in this context. We then custom-apply the APIG framework to an important signal processing problem: the joint beamforming and compression problem (JBCP) with per-antenna power constraints (PAPCs) in cooperative cellular networks. This customized application requires careful exploitation of the problem's special structure such as the tightness of the semidefinite relaxation (SDR) and the differentiability of the dual. Numerical experiments demonstrate the superior performance of our custom-application over state-of-the-art benchmarks for the JBCP.

Title: Quantum Meets SAR: A Novel Range-Doppler Algorithm for Next-Gen Earth Observation
Authors: Khalil Al Salahat, Mohamad El Moussawi, Veera Ganesh Yalla, Ali J. Ghandour
Abstract: Synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data processing is crucial for high-resolution Earth observation and remote sensing applications, one of the most commonly used algorithms for this task is the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA). Using the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), the collected signal is transformed to the frequency domain and then goes through the processing steps of this algorithm. However, when it comes to large datasets, this process can be computationally expensive. This paper explores the implementation of a Quantum Range Doppler Algorithm (QRDA), relying on the Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT) as a speedup tool over the classical FFT. Additionally, it proposes a quantum version of the Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) in the Fourier domain, one of the key correctional steps of the RDA algorithm, and compares it with its classical counterpart.

Title: Virtual Target Trajectory Prediction for Stochastic Targets
Authors: Marc Schneider, Renato Loureiro, TorbjÃ¸rn Cunis, Walter Fichter
Abstract: Trajectory prediction of other vehicles is crucial for autonomous vehicles, with applications from missile guidance to UAV collision avoidance. Typically, target trajectories are assumed deterministic, but real-world aerial vehicles exhibit stochastic behavior, such as evasive maneuvers or gliders circling in thermals. This paper uses Conditional Normalizing Flows, an unsupervised Machine Learning technique, to learn and predict the stochastic behavior of targets of guided missiles using trajectory data. The trained model predicts the distribution of future target positions based on initial conditions and parameters of the dynamics. Samples from this distribution are clustered using a time series k-means algorithm to generate representative trajectories, termed virtual targets. The method is fast and target-agnostic, requiring only training data in the form of target trajectories. Thus, it serves as a drop-in replacement for deterministic trajectory predictions in guidance laws and path planning. Simulated scenarios demonstrate the approach's effectiveness for aerial vehicles with random maneuvers, bridging the gap between deterministic predictions and stochastic reality, advancing guidance and control algorithms for autonomous vehicles.

Title: Source Coding for a Wiener Process
Authors: Sahan Liyanaarachchi, Ismail Cosandal, Sennur Ulukus
Abstract: We develop a novel source coding strategy for sampling and monitoring of a Wiener process. For the encoding process, we employ a four level ``quantization'' scheme, which employs monotone function thresholds as opposed to fixed constant thresholds. Leveraging the hitting times of the Wiener process with these thresholds, we devise a sampling and encoding strategy which does not incur any quantization errors. We give analytical expressions for the mean squared error (MSE) and find the optimal source code lengths to minimize the MSE under this monotone function threshold scheme, subject to a sampling rate constraint.

Title: Efficient Federated Learning Tiny Language Models for Mobile Network Feature Prediction
Authors: Daniel Becking, Ingo Friese, Karsten MÃ¼ller, Thomas Buchholz, Mandy Galkow-Schneider, Wojciech Samek, Detlev Marpe
Abstract: In telecommunications, Autonomous Networks (ANs) automatically adjust configurations based on specific requirements (e.g., bandwidth) and available resources. These networks rely on continuous monitoring and intelligent mechanisms for self-optimization, self-repair, and self-protection, nowadays enhanced by Neural Networks (NNs) to enable predictive modeling and pattern recognition. Here, Federated Learning (FL) allows multiple AN cells - each equipped with NNs - to collaboratively train models while preserving data privacy. However, FL requires frequent transmission of large neural data and thus an efficient, standardized compression strategy for reliable communication. To address this, we investigate NNCodec, a Fraunhofer implementation of the ISO/IEC Neural Network Coding (NNC) standard, within a novel FL framework that integrates tiny language models (TLMs) for various mobile network feature prediction (e.g., ping, SNR or band frequency). Our experimental results on the Berlin V2X dataset demonstrate that NNCodec achieves transparent compression (i.e., negligible performance loss) while reducing communication overhead to below 1%, showing the effectiveness of combining NNC with FL in collaboratively learned autonomous mobile networks.

Title: Fast-Converged Deep Reinforcement Learning for Optimal Dispatch of Large-Scale Power Systems under Transient Security Constraints
Authors: Tannan Xiao, Ying Chen, Han Diao, Shaowei Huang, Chen Shen
Abstract: Power system optimal dispatch with transient security constraints is commonly represented as Transient Security-Constrained Optimal Power Flow (TSC-OPF). Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)-based TSC-OPF trains efficient decision-making agents that are adaptable to various scenarios and provide solution results quickly. However, due to the high dimensionality of the state space and action spaces, as well as the non-smoothness of dynamic constraints, existing DRL-based TSC-OPF solution methods face a significant challenge of the sparse reward problem. To address this issue, a fast-converged DRL method for TSC-OPF is proposed in this paper. The Markov Decision Process (MDP) modeling of TSC-OPF is improved by reducing the observation space and smoothing the reward design, thus facilitating agent training. An improved Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient algorithm with Curriculum learning, Parallel exploration, and Ensemble decision-making (DDPG-CPEn) is introduced to drastically enhance the efficiency of agent training and the accuracy of decision-making. The effectiveness, efficiency, and accuracy of the proposed method are demonstrated through experiments in the IEEE 39-bus system and a practical 710-bus regional power grid. The source code of the proposed method is made public on GitHub.

Authors: Khai Le-Duc, David Thulke, Hung-Phong Tran, Long Vo-Dang, Khai-Nguyen Nguyen, Truong-Son Hy, Ralf SchlÃ¼ter
Abstract: Spoken Named Entity Recognition (NER) aims to extract named entities from speech and categorise them into types like person, location, organization, etc. In this work, we present VietMed-NER - the first spoken NER dataset in the medical domain. To our knowledge, our Vietnamese real-world dataset is the largest spoken NER dataset in the world regarding the number of entity types, featuring 18 distinct types. Furthermore, we present baseline results using various state-of-the-art pre-trained models: encoder-only and sequence-to-sequence; and conduct quantitative and qualitative error analysis. We found that pre-trained multilingual models generally outperform monolingual models on reference text and ASR output and encoders outperform sequence-to-sequence models in NER tasks. By translating the transcripts, the dataset can also be utilised for text NER in the medical domain in other languages than Vietnamese. All code, data and models are publicly available: this https URL.

Title: Distribution System Reconfiguration to Mitigate Load Altering Attacks via Stackelberg Games
Authors: Sajjad Maleki, E. Veronica Belmaga, Charalambos Konstantinou, Subhash Lakshminarayana
Abstract: The integration of IoT-controllable devices in power systems (such as smart electric vehicle charging stations, heat pumps, etc.), despite their benefits, raises novel cybersecurity concerns. Vulnerabilities in these devices can be leveraged to launch load-altering attacks (LAAs) that can potentially compromise the safety of power systems. In this paper, we analyze the impact of LAAs on the voltage profile of distribution networks (DNs). We first derive closed-form expressions to quantify the attacks' impact. Using the insights derived from this analysis, we then propose a reactive defense method to mitigate LAAs based on reconfiguring the DNs. We also study optimal defense strategies that are robust to LAAs by exploiting non-cooperative sequential game theory. The proposed solution takes into account the potential uncertainties in the attack localization. Furthermore, we propose a Bayesian optimization (BO) approach to compute the equilibrium of the game, which reduces the computational burden. Our results show that attacks launched on the deepest nodes in the DN have the most detrimental effect on the grid voltage profile. Furthermore, the proposed game-theoretic strategy successfully mitigates the effect of the attack while ensuring minimum system reconfiguration.

Title: Joint Active and Passive Beamforming Design for IRS-aided MIMO ISAC Based on Sensing Mutual Information
Authors: Jin Li, Gui Zhou, Tantao Gong, Nan Liu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)/reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system based on sensing mutual information (MI). Specifically, the base station (BS) perceives the sensing target via the reflected sensing signal by the IRS, while communicating with the users simultaneously. Our aim is to maximize the sensing MI, subject to the quality of service (QoS) constraints for all communication users, the transmit power constraint at the BS, and the unit-modulus constraint on the IRS's passive reflection. We solve this problem under two cases: one simplified case assuming a line-of-sight (LoS) channel between the BS and IRS and no clutter interference to sensing, and the other generalized case considering the Rician fading channel of the BS-IRS link and the presence of clutter interference to sensing. For the first case, we prove that the dedicated sensing beamformer is unnecessary for improving sensing MI and develop a low-complexity iterative algorithm to jointly optimize the BS and IRS active/passive beamformers. Then, for the second case, we propose an alternative iterative algorithm, which can also be applied to the first case, to solve the beamforming design problem under the general setup. Numerical results are provided to validate the performance of the proposed algorithms, as compared to various benchmark schemes.

Title: Semantic-Enabled 6G Communication: A Task-oriented and Privacy-preserving Perspective
Authors: Shuaishuai Guo, Anbang Zhang, Yanhu Wang, Chenyuan Feng, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: Task-oriented semantic communication (ToSC) emerges as an innovative approach in the 6G landscape, characterized by the transmission of only vital information that is directly pertinent to a specific task. While ToSC offers an efficient mode of communication, it concurrently raises concerns regarding privacy, as sophisticated adversaries might possess the capability to reconstruct the original data from the transmitted features. This paper provides an in-depth analysis of privacy-preserving strategies specifically designed for ToSC relying on deep neural network-based joint source and channel coding (DeepJSCC). Our study encompasses a detailed comparative assessment of trustworthy feature perturbation methods such as differential privacy (DP) and encryption, alongside intrinsic security incorporation approaches like adversarial learning to train the JSCC and learning-based vector quantization (LBVQ). Our comparative analysis underscores the integration of advanced explainable learning algorithms into communication systems, positing a new benchmark for privacy standards in the forthcoming 6G era.

Title: Incremental Composition of Learned Control Barrier Functions in Unknown Environments
Authors: Paul Lutkus, Deepika Anantharaman, Stephen Tu, Lars Lindemann
Abstract: We consider the problem of safely exploring a static and unknown environment while learning valid control barrier functions (CBFs) from sensor data. Existing works either assume known environments, target specific dynamics models, or use a-priori valid CBFs, and are thus limited in their safety guarantees for general systems during exploration. We present a method for safely exploring the unknown environment by incrementally composing a global CBF from locally-learned CBFs. The challenge here is that local CBFs may not have well-defined end behavior outside their training domain, i.e. local CBFs may be positive (indicating safety) in regions where no training data is available. We show that well-defined end behavior can be obtained when local CBFs are parameterized by compactly-supported radial basis functions. For learning local CBFs, we collect sensor data, e.g. LiDAR capturing obstacles in the environment, and augment it with simulated data from a safe oracle controller. Our work complements recent efforts to learn CBFs from safe demonstrations -- where learned safe sets are limited to their training domains -- by demonstrating how to grow the safe set over time as more data becomes available. We evaluate our approach on two simulated systems, where our method successfully explores an unknown environment while maintaining safety throughout the entire execution.

Title: Universal Global State Estimation for Inertial Navigation Systems
Authors: Sifeddine Benahmed, Soulaimane Berkane, Tarek Hamel
Abstract: This paper addresses the problem of accurate pose estimation (position, velocity, and orientation) for a rigid body. By utilizing generic exteroceptive measurements in combination with an Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), we reformulate the vehicle's dynamics and outputs to fit within a linear time-varying (LTV) framework. This transformation enables the application of a linear continuous-time Kalman filter, thereby avoiding the complexities of nonlinear estimators and local Kalman-type filtering methods (e.g., EKF). We perform a complete uniform observability analysis for key benchmark problems (e.g., GPS-INS and Landmark-INS) and derive sufficient conditions for ensuring global uniform exponential stability. Simulations are conducted for two practical applications: stereo-aided inertial navigation systems (INS) with both constant and time-varying gains, as well as GPS-aided INS. The proposed approach notably simplifies observer design for INS.

Title: A New Type of Nonlinear Disturbance Rejection
Authors: Simon Kuang, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Asymptotic disturbance rejection (equivalently tracking) for nonlinear systems has been studied only in qualitative terms (the state is asymptotically stable under bounded disturbances). We show how to prove quantitative performance guarantees for the nonlinear servomechanism problem. Our technique originates by applying a gain inequalities point of view to an ad fontes reexamination of the linear problem: what is the nonlinear equivalent of a sensitivity transfer function with a zero at the origin? We answer: a nonlinear input-output system is high-pass if its output is stable with respect to the \emph{derivative} of the input. We first show that definition generalizes high-pass resistor-capacitor circuit analysis to accommodate nonlinear resistors. We then show that this definition generalizes the steady-state disturbance rejection property of integral feedback controllers for linear systems. The theoretical payoff is that low-frequency disturbance rejection is captured by a quantitative, non-asymptotic output cost bound. Finally, we raise theoretical questions about compositionality of nonlinear operators.

Title: Learning Koopman-based Stability Certificates for Unknown Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Ruikun Zhou, Yiming Meng, Zhexuan Zeng, Jun Liu
Abstract: Koopman operator theory has gained significant attention in recent years for identifying discrete-time nonlinear systems by embedding them into an infinite-dimensional linear vector space. However, providing stability guarantees while learning the continuous-time dynamics, especially under conditions of relatively low observation frequency, remains a challenge within the existing Koopman-based learning frameworks. To address this challenge, we propose an algorithmic framework to simultaneously learn the vector field and Lyapunov functions for unknown nonlinear systems, using a limited amount of data sampled across the state space and along the trajectories at a relatively low sampling frequency. The proposed framework builds upon recently developed high-accuracy Koopman generator learning for capturing transient system transitions and physics-informed neural networks for training Lyapunov functions. We show that the learned Lyapunov functions can be formally verified using a satisfiability modulo theories (SMT) solver and provide less conservative estimates of the region of attraction compared to existing methods.

Title: Semantic Communications for Digital Signals via Carrier Images
Authors: Zhigang Yan, Dong Li
Abstract: Most of current semantic communication (SemCom) frameworks focus on the image transmission, which, however, do not address the problem on how to deliver digital signals without any semantic features. This paper proposes a novel SemCom approach to transmit digital signals by using the image as the carrier signal. Specifically, the proposed approach encodes the digital signal as a binary stream and maps it to mask locations on an image. This allows binary data to be visually represented, enabling the use of existing model, pre-trained Masked Autoencoders (MAE), which are optimized for masked image reconstruction, as the SemCom encoder and decoder. Since MAE can both process and recover masked images, this approach allows for the joint transmission of digital signals and images without incurring significant communication overheads. In addition, considering the mask tokens transmission encoded by the MAE still faces extra costs, we design a sparse encoding module at the transmitter to encode the mask tokens into a sparse matrix, and it can be recovered at the receiver. Thus, this approach simply needs to transmit the latent representations of the unmasked patches and a sparse matrix, which further reduce the transmission overhead compared with the original MAE encoder. Simulation results show that the approach maintains reliable transmission even in a high mask ratio of images.

Title: Active Sampling and Gaussian Reconstruction for Radio Frequency Radiance Field
Authors: Chi-Shiang Gau, Xingyu Chen, Tara Javidi, Xinyu Zhang
Abstract: Radio-frequency (RF) Radiance Field reconstruction is a challenging problem. The difficulty lies in the interactions between the propagating signal and objects, such as reflections and diffraction, which are hard to model precisely, especially when the shapes and materials of the objects are unknown. Previously, a neural network-based method was proposed to reconstruct the RF Radiance Field, showing promising results. However, this neural network-based method has some limitations: it requires a large number of samples for training and is computationally expensive. Additionally, the neural network only provides the predicted mean of the RF Radiance Field and does not offer an uncertainty model. In this work, we propose a training-free Gaussian reconstruction method for RF Radiance Field. Our method demonstrates that the required number of samples is significantly smaller compared to the neural network-based approach. Furthermore, we introduce an uncertainty model that provides confidence estimates for predictions at any selected position in the scene. We also combine the Gaussian reconstruction method with active sampling, which further reduces the number of samples needed to achieve the same performance. Finally, we explore the potential benefits of our method in a quasi-dynamic setting, showcasing its ability to adapt to changes in the scene without requiring the entire process to be repeated.

Title: A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei
Abstract: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. We then develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis to compute the private state set. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against inference attacks and its superiority compared to a truncated Gaussian mechanism.

Title: Muographic Image Upsampling with Machine Learning for Built Infrastructure Applications
Authors: William O'Donnell, David Mahon, Guangliang Yang, Simon Gardner
Abstract: The civil engineering industry faces a critical need for innovative non-destructive evaluation methods, particularly for ageing critical infrastructure, such as bridges, where current techniques fall short. Muography, a non-invasive imaging technique, constructs three-dimensional density maps by detecting interactions of naturally occurring cosmic-ray muons within the scanned volume. Cosmic-ray muons provide deep penetration and inherent safety due to their high momenta and natural source. However, the technology's reliance on this source results in constrained muon flux, leading to prolonged acquisition times, noisy reconstructions and image interpretation challenges. To address these limitations, we developed a two-model deep learning approach. First, we employed a conditional Wasserstein generative adversarial network with gradient penalty (cWGAN-GP) to perform predictive upsampling of undersampled muography images. Using the Structural Similarity Index Measure (SSIM), 1-day sampled images matched the perceptual qualities of a 21-day image, while the Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) indicated noise improvement equivalent to 31 days of sampling. A second cWGAN-GP model, trained for semantic segmentation, quantitatively assessed the upsampling model's impact on concrete sample features. This model achieved segmentation of rebar grids and tendon ducts, with Dice-SÃ¸rensen accuracy coefficients of 0.8174 and 0.8663. Notably, it could mitigate or remove z-plane smearing artifacts caused by muography's inverse imaging problem. Both models were trained on a comprehensive Geant4 Monte-Carlo simulation dataset reflecting realistic civil infrastructure scenarios. Our results demonstrate significant improvements in acquisition speed and image quality, marking a substantial step toward making muography more practical for reinforced concrete infrastructure monitoring applications.

Title: Weakly Supervised Convolutional Dictionary Learning with Shared and Discriminative Components for Classification
Authors: Hao Chen, Yusen Wu, Dayuan Tan
Abstract: In today's data-driven landscape spanning finance, government, and healthcare sectors, the exponential growth of information necessitates robust solutions for secure storage, efficient dissemination, and fine-grained access control. Convolutional dictionary learning emerges as a powerful approach for extracting meaningful representations from complex data. This paper presents a novel weakly supervised convolutional dictionary learning framework that incorporates both shared and discriminative components for classification tasks. Our approach leverages limited label information to learn dictionaries that capture common patterns across classes while simultaneously highlighting class-specific features. By decomposing the learned representations into shared and discriminative parts, we enhance both feature interpretability and classification performance. Extensive experiments across multiple datasets demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art approaches, particularly in scenarios with limited labeled data. The proposed framework offers a promising solution for applications requiring both effective feature extraction and accurate classification in weakly supervised settings.

Title: Ensuring Safe and Smooth Control in Safety-Critical Systems via Filtered Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Shuo Liu, Wei Xiao, Calin A. Belta
Abstract: In safety-critical control systems, ensuring both system safety and smooth control input is essential for theoretical guarantees and practical deployment. Existing Control Barrier Function (CBF) frameworks, especially High-Order CBFs (HOCBFs), effectively enforce safety constraints but often lead to nonsmooth or discontinuous control inputs that can degrade system performance or violate actuator limitations. This paper introduces Filtered Control Barrier Functions (FCBFs), which extend HOCBFs by incorporating an auxiliary dynamic system - referred to as input regularization filter - to produce Lipschitz continuous control inputs. The proposed framework ensures safety, control bounds, and smoothness simultaneously by integrating FCBFs and HOCBFs within a unified quadratic program (QP). Theoretical guarantees are provided and simulations on a unicycle model demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method compared to standard and smoothness-penalized HOCBF approaches.

Title: Unraveling tensor structures in correct-by-design controller synthesis
Authors: Ruohan Wang, Zhiyong Sun, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: Formal safety guarantees on the synthesis of controllers for stochastic systems can be obtained using correct-by-design approaches. These approaches often use abstractions as finite-state Markov Decision Processes. As the state space of these MDPs grows, the curse of dimensionality makes the computational and memory cost of the probabilistic guarantees, quantified with dynamic programming, scale exponentially. In this work, we leverage decoupled dynamics and unravel, via dynamic programming operations, a tree structure in the Canonical Polyadic Decomposition (CPD) of the value functions. For discrete-time stochastic systems with syntactically co-safe linear temporal logic (scLTL) specifications, we provide provable probabilistic safety guarantees and significantly alleviate the computational burden. We provide an initial validation of the theoretical results on several typical case studies and showcase that the uncovered tree structure enables efficient reductions in the computational burden.

Title: Quantifying Grid-Forming Behavior: Bridging Device-level Dynamics and System-Level Stability
Authors: Kehao Zhuang, Huanhai Xin, Verena HÃ¤berle, Xiuqiang He, Linbin Huang, Florian DÃ¶rfler
Abstract: Grid-Forming (GFM) technology is considered a promising solution to build power electronics-dominated power systems. However, the impact of GFM converters on the system stability is still unquantified, creating a gap between the system- and device-level perspectives. To fill this gap, at the device-level, we propose a Forming Index to quantify a converter's response to grid voltage variations, providing a characterization of its GFM behavior. At the system-level, a quantitative notion of System Strength is introduced to capture the fundamental requirements for power system formation. Finally, we establish the alignment between device- and system-level metrics by demonstrating that GFM converters provably enhance system strength.

It was deployed in 17 major healthcare systems in India including diagnostic centers, large hospitals, and government hospitals. Over the deployment period, the system processed over 150,000 scans, averaging 2,000 chest X rays daily, resulting in reduced reporting times and improved diagnostic accuracy. Conclusion: The high precision and recall validate the AI's capability as a reliable tool for autonomous normal abnormal classification, pathology localization, and segmentation. This scalable AI model addresses diagnostic gaps in underserved areas, optimizing radiology workflows and enhancing patient care across diverse healthcare settings in India.

Title: How Cyclic Acoustic Patterns Influence ASMR Perception: A Signal Processing Perspective
Authors: Zexin Fang, Bin Han, Henrik H. Sveen, C. Clark Cao, Hans D. Schotten
Abstract: Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response (ASMR) has been remarkably popular in the recent decade. While its effect has been validated through behavioral studies and neuro-physiological measurements such as electroencephalography (EEG) and related bio-signal analyses, its development and triggers remain a subject of debate. Previous studies suggest that its triggers are highly linked with cyclic patterns: predictable patterns introduce relaxation while variations maintain intrigue. To validate this and further understand the impact of acoustic features on ASMR effects, we designed three distinct cyclic patterns with monophonic and stereophonic variations, while controlling their predictability and randomness, and collected ASMR triggering scores through online surveys. Then, we extracted cyclic features and carried out regression analysis, seeking an explainable mapping of cyclic features and ASMR triggers. We found that relaxing effects accumulate progressively and are independent of spatial orientation. Cyclic patterns significantly influence psychological and physical effects, which remain invariant with time. Regression analysis revealed that smoothly spread and energy-dense cyclic patterns most effectively trigger ASMR responses.

Title: Toward Interpretable Sleep Stage Classification Using Cross-Modal Transformers
Authors: Jathurshan Pradeepkumar, Mithunjha Anandakumar, Vinith Kugathasan, Dhinesh Suntharalingham, Simon L. Kappel, Anjula C. De Silva, Chamira U. S. Edussooriya
Abstract: Accurate sleep stage classification is significant for sleep health assessment. In recent years, several machine-learning based sleep staging algorithms have been developed , and in particular, deep-learning based algorithms have achieved performance on par with human annotation. Despite improved performance, a limitation of most deep-learning based algorithms is their black-box behavior, which have limited their use in clinical settings. Here, we propose a cross-modal transformer, which is a transformer-based method for sleep stage classification. The proposed cross-modal transformer consists of a novel cross-modal transformer encoder architecture along with a multi-scale one-dimensional convolutional neural network for automatic representation learning. Our method outperforms the state-of-the-art methods and eliminates the black-box behavior of deep-learning models by utilizing the interpretability aspect of the attention modules. Furthermore, our method provides considerable reductions in the number of parameters and training time compared to the state-of-the-art methods. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Equitably allocating wildfire resilience investments for power grids: The curse of aggregation and vulnerability indices
Authors: Madeleine Pollack, Ryan Piansky, Swati Gupta, Daniel Molzahn
Abstract: Social vulnerability indices have increased traction for guiding infrastructure investment decisions to prioritize communities that need these investments most. One such plan is the Biden-Harris Justice40 initiative, which aims to guide equitable infrastructure investments by ensuring that disadvantaged communities defined by the Climate & Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST) receive 40% of the total benefit realized by the investment. However, there is limited research on the practicality of applying vulnerability indices like the CEJST to real-world decision-making for policy outcomes. In this paper, we study this gap by examining the effectiveness of vulnerability indices in a case study focused on power shutoff and undergrounding decisions in wildfire-prone regions. Using a mixed-integer program and a high-fidelity synthetic transmission network in Texas, we model resource allocation policies inspired by Justice40 and evaluate their impact on reducing power outages and mitigating wildfire risk for vulnerable groups. Our analysis reveals that the Justice40 framework may fail to protect certain communities facing high wildfire risk. In our case study, we show that indigenous groups are particularly impacted. We posit that this outcome is likely due to information losses from data aggregation and the use of generalized vulnerability indices. Through the use of explicit group-level protections, we are able to bound the best possible outcome for population groups that are proportionally most affected.

Title: Measuring Discrete Sensing Capability for ISAC via Task Mutual Information
Authors: Fei Shang, Haohua Du, Panlong Yang, Xin He, Jingjing Wang, Xiang-Yang Li
Abstract: 6G technology offers a broader range of possibilities for communication systems to perform ubiquitous sensing tasks, including health monitoring, object recognition, and autonomous driving. Since even minor environmental changes can significantly degrade system performance, and conducting long-term posterior experimental evaluations in all scenarios is often infeasible, it is crucial to perform a priori performance assessments to design robust and reliable systems. In this paper, we consider a discrete ubiquitous sensing system where the sensing target has \(m\) different states \(W\), which can be characterized by \(n\)-dimensional independent features \(X^n\). This model not only provides the possibility of optimizing the sensing systems at a finer granularity and balancing communication and sensing resources, but also provides theoretical explanations for classical intuitive feelings (like more modalities and more accuracy) in wireless sensing. Furthermore, we validate the effectiveness of the proposed channel model through real-case studies, including person identification, displacement detection, direction estimation, and device recognition. The evaluation results indicate a Pearson correlation coefficient exceeding 0.9 between our task mutual information and conventional experimental metrics (e.g., accuracy).

Title: Vision Transformers for End-to-End Vision-Based Quadrotor Obstacle Avoidance
Authors: Anish Bhattacharya, Nishanth Rao, Dhruv Parikh, Pratik Kunapuli, Yuwei Wu, Yuezhan Tao, Nikolai Matni, Vijay Kumar
Abstract: We demonstrate the capabilities of an attention-based end-to-end approach for high-speed vision-based quadrotor obstacle avoidance in dense, cluttered environments, with comparison to various state-of-the-art learning architectures. Quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) have tremendous maneuverability when flown fast; however, as flight speed increases, traditional model-based approaches to navigation via independent perception, mapping, planning, and control modules breaks down due to increased sensor noise, compounding errors, and increased processing latency. Thus, learning-based, end-to-end vision-to-control networks have shown to have great potential for online control of these fast robots through cluttered environments. We train and compare convolutional, U-Net, and recurrent architectures against vision transformer (ViT) models for depth image-to-control in high-fidelity simulation, observing that ViT models are more effective than others as quadrotor speeds increase and in generalization to unseen environments, while the addition of recurrence further improves performance while reducing quadrotor energy cost across all tested flight speeds. We assess performance at speeds of up to 7m/s in simulation and hardware. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to utilize vision transformers for end-to-end vision-based quadrotor control.

Title: Stochastic Reservoir Computers
Authors: Peter J. Ehlers, Hendra I. Nurdin, Daniel Soh
Abstract: Reservoir computing is a form of machine learning that utilizes nonlinear dynamical systems to perform complex tasks in a cost-effective manner when compared to typical neural networks. Many recent advancements in reservoir computing, in particular quantum reservoir computing, make use of reservoirs that are inherently stochastic. However, the theoretical justification for using these systems has not yet been well established. In this paper, we investigate the universality of stochastic reservoir computers, in which we use a stochastic system for reservoir computing using the probabilities of each reservoir state as the readout instead of the states themselves. In stochastic reservoir computing, the number of distinct states of the entire reservoir computer can potentially scale exponentially with the size of the reservoir hardware, offering the advantage of compact device size. We prove that classes of stochastic echo state networks, and therefore the class of all stochastic reservoir computers, are universal approximating classes. We also investigate the performance of two practical examples of stochastic reservoir computers in classification and chaotic time series prediction. While shot noise is a limiting factor in the performance of stochastic reservoir computing, we show significantly improved performance compared to a deterministic reservoir computer with similar hardware in cases where the effects of noise are small.

Title: Trustworthy Enhanced Multi-view Multi-modal Alzheimer's Disease Prediction with Brain-wide Imaging Transcriptomics Data
Authors: Shan Cong, Zhoujie Fan, Hongwei Liu, Yinghan Zhang, Xin Wang, Haoran Luo, Xiaohui Yao
Abstract: Brain transcriptomics provides insights into the molecular mechanisms by which the brain coordinates its functions and processes. However, existing multimodal methods for predicting Alzheimer's disease (AD) primarily rely on imaging and sometimes genetic data, often neglecting the transcriptomic basis of brain. Furthermore, while striving to integrate complementary information between modalities, most studies overlook the informativeness disparities between modalities. Here, we propose TMM, a trusted multiview multimodal graph attention framework for AD diagnosis, using extensive brain-wide transcriptomics and imaging data. First, we construct view-specific brain regional co-function networks (RRIs) from transcriptomics and multimodal radiomics data to incorporate interaction information from both biomolecular and imaging perspectives. Next, we apply graph attention (GAT) processing to each RRI network to produce graph embeddings and employ cross-modal attention to fuse transcriptomics-derived embedding with each imagingderived embedding. Finally, a novel true-false-harmonized class probability (TFCP) strategy is designed to assess and adaptively adjust the prediction confidence of each modality for AD diagnosis. We evaluate TMM using the AHBA database with brain-wide transcriptomics data and the ADNI database with three imaging modalities (AV45-PET, FDG-PET, and VBM-MRI). The results demonstrate the superiority of our method in identifying AD, EMCI, and LMCI compared to state-of-the-arts. Code and data are available at this https URL.

Title: ICSD: An Open-source Dataset for Infant Cry and Snoring Detection
Authors: Qingyu Liu, Longfei Song, Dongxing Xu, Yanhua Long
Abstract: The detection and analysis of infant cry and snoring events are crucial tasks within the field of audio signal processing. While existing datasets for general sound event detection are plentiful, they often fall short in providing sufficient, strongly labeled data specific to infant cries and snoring. To provide a benchmark dataset and thus foster the research of infant cry and snoring detection, this paper introduces the Infant Cry and Snoring Detection (ICSD) dataset, a novel, publicly available dataset specially designed for ICSD tasks. The ICSD comprises three types of subsets: a real strongly labeled subset with event-based labels annotated manually, a weakly labeled subset with only clip-level event annotations, and a synthetic subset generated and labeled with strong annotations. This paper provides a detailed description of the ICSD creation process, including the challenges encountered and the solutions adopted. We offer a comprehensive characterization of the dataset, discussing its limitations and key factors for ICSD usage. Additionally, we conduct extensive experiments on the ICSD dataset to establish baseline systems and offer insights into the main factors when using this dataset for ICSD research. Our goal is to develop a dataset that will be widely adopted by the community as a new open benchmark for future ICSD research.

Authors: Lingwei Meng, Shujie Hu, Jiawen Kang, Zhaoqing Li, Yuejiao Wang, Wenxuan Wu, Xixin Wu, Xunying Liu, Helen Meng
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) have revolutionized various domains, bringing significant progress and new opportunities. Despite progress in speech-related tasks, LLMs have not been sufficiently explored in multi-talker scenarios. In this work, we present a pioneering effort to investigate the capability of LLMs in transcribing speech in multi-talker environments, following versatile instructions related to multi-talker automatic speech recognition (ASR), target talker ASR, and ASR based on specific talker attributes such as sex, occurrence order, language, and keyword spoken. Our approach utilizes WavLM and Whisper encoder to extract multi-faceted speech representations that are sensitive to speaker characteristics and semantic context. These representations are then fed into an LLM fine-tuned using LoRA, enabling the capabilities for speech comprehension and transcription. Comprehensive experiments reveal the promising performance of our proposed system, MT-LLM, in cocktail party scenarios, highlighting the potential of LLM to handle speech-related tasks based on user instructions in such complex settings.

Abstract: Decentralized Metaverses, built on Web 3.0 and Web 4.0 technologies, have attracted significant attention across various fields. This innovation leverages blockchain, Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs), Extended Reality (XR) and advanced technologies to create immersive and interconnected digital environments that mirror the real world. This article delves into the Metaverse of Everything (MoE), a platform that fuses the Metaverse concept with the Internet of Everything (IoE), an advanced version of the Internet of Things (IoT) that connects not only physical devices but also people, data and processes within a networked environment. Thus, the MoE integrates generated data and virtual entities, creating an extensive network of interconnected components. This article seeks to advance current MoE, examining decentralization and the application of Opportunistic Edge Computing (OEC) for interactions with surrounding IoT devices and IoE entities. Moreover, it outlines the main challenges to guide researchers and businesses towards building a future cyber-resilient opportunistic MoE.

Title: Polarization Aware Movable Antenna
Authors: Runxin Zhang, Yulin Shao, Yonina C. Eldar
Abstract: This paper presents a polarization-aware movable antenna (PAMA) framework that integrates polarization effects into the design and optimization of movable antennas (MAs). While MAs have proven effective at boosting wireless communication performance, existing studies primarily focus on phase variations caused by different propagation paths and leverage antenna movements to maximize channel gains. This narrow focus limits the full potential of MAs. In this work, we introduce a polarization-aware channel model rooted in electromagnetic theory, unveiling a defining advantage of MAs over other wireless technologies such as precoding: the ability to optimize polarization matching. This new understanding enables PAMA to extend the applicability of MAs beyond radio-frequency, multipath-rich scenarios to higher-frequency bands, such as mmWave, even with a single line-of-sight (LOS) path. Our findings demonstrate that incorporating polarization considerations into MAs significantly enhances efficiency, link reliability, and data throughput, paving the way for more robust and efficient future wireless networks.

Title: SAV-SE: Scene-aware Audio-Visual Speech Enhancement with Selective State Space Model
Authors: Xinyuan Qian, Jiaran Gao, Yaodan Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Hexin Liu, Leibny Paola Garcia, Haizhou Li
Abstract: Speech enhancement plays an essential role in various applications, and the integration of visual information has been demonstrated to bring substantial advantages. However, the majority of current research concentrates on the examination of facial and lip movements, which can be compromised or entirely inaccessible in scenarios where occlusions occur or when the camera view is distant. Whereas contextual visual cues from the surrounding environment have been overlooked: for example, when we see a dog bark, our brain has the innate ability to discern and filter out the barking noise. To this end, in this paper, we introduce a novel task, i.e. SAV-SE. To our best knowledge, this is the first proposal to use rich contextual information from synchronized video as auxiliary cues to indicate the type of noise, which eventually improves the speech enhancement performance. Specifically, we propose the VC-S$^2$E method, which incorporates the Conformer and Mamba modules for their complementary strengths. Extensive experiments are conducted on public MUSIC, AVSpeech and AudioSet datasets, where the results demonstrate the superiority of VC-S$^2$E over other competitive methods. We will make the source code publicly available. Project demo page: this https URL

Title: DGSNA: prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition method
Authors: Zihao Chen, Zhentao Lin, Bi Zeng, Linyi Huang, Zhi Li, Jia Cai
Abstract: To ensure the reliable operation of speech systems across diverse environments, noise addition methods have emerged as the prevailing solution. However, existing methods offer limited coverage of real-world noisy scenes and depend on pre-existing scene-based information and noise. This paper presents prompt-based Dynamic Generative Scene-based Noise Addition (DGSNA), a novel noise addition methodology that integrates Dynamic Generation of Scene-based Information (DGSI) with Scene-based Noise Addition for Speech (SNAS). This integration facilitates automated scene-based noise addition by transforming clean speech into various noise environments, thereby providing a more comprehensive and realistic simulation of diverse noise conditions. Experimental results demonstrate that DGSNA significantly enhances the robustness of speech recognition and keyword spotting models across various noise conditions, achieving a relative improvement of up to 11.21%. Furthermore, DGSNA can be effectively integrated with other noise addition methods to enhance performance. Our implementation and demonstrations are available at this https URL.

Abstract: Traffic simulation is essential for autonomous vehicle (AV) development, enabling comprehensive safety evaluation across diverse driving conditions. However, traditional rule-based simulators struggle to capture complex human interactions, while data-driven approaches often fail to maintain long-term behavioral realism or generate diverse safety-critical events. To address these challenges, we propose TeraSim, an open-source, high-fidelity traffic simulation platform designed to uncover unknown unsafe events and efficiently estimate AV statistical performance metrics, such as crash rates. TeraSim is designed for seamless integration with third-party physics simulators and standalone AV stacks, to construct a complete AV simulation system. Experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness in generating diverse safety-critical events involving both static and dynamic agents, identifying hidden deficiencies in AV systems, and enabling statistical performance evaluation. These findings highlight TeraSim's potential as a practical tool for AV safety assessment, benefiting researchers, developers, and policymakers. The code is available at this https URL.

Title: Comparative Study of Spike Encoding Methods for Environmental Sound Classification
Authors: Andres Larroza, Javier Naranjo-Alcazar, Vicent Ortiz CastellÃ³, Pedro Zuccarello
Abstract: Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) offer a promising approach to reduce energy consumption and computational demands, making them particularly beneficial for embedded machine learning in edge applications. However, data from conventional digital sensors must first be converted into spike trains to be processed using neuromorphic computing technologies. The classification of environmental sounds presents unique challenges due to the high variability of frequencies, background noise, and overlapping acoustic events. Despite these challenges, most studies on spike-based audio encoding focus on speech processing, leaving non-speech environmental sounds underexplored. In this work, we conduct a comprehensive comparison of widely used spike encoding techniques, evaluating their effectiveness on the ESC-10 dataset. By understanding the impact of encoding choices on environmental sound processing, researchers and practitioners can select the most suitable approach for real-world applications such as smart surveillance, environmental monitoring, and industrial acoustic analysis. This study serves as a benchmark for spike encoding in environmental sound classification, providing a foundational reference for future research in neuromorphic audio processing.

Title: Channel Estimation for Pinching-Antenna Systems (PASS)
Authors: Jian Xiao, Ji Wang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Pinching Antennas (PAs) represent a revolutionary flexible antenna technology that leverages dielectric waveguides and electromagnetic coupling to mitigate large-scale path loss. This letter is the first to explore channel estimation for Pinching-Antenna SyStems (PASS), addressing their uniquely ill-conditioned and underdetermined channel characteristics. In particular, two efficient deep learning-based channel estimators are proposed. 1) PAMoE: This estimator incorporates dynamic padding, feature embedding, fusion, and mixture of experts (MoE) modules, which effectively leverage the positional information of PAs and exploit expert diversity. 2) PAformer: This Transformer-style estimator employs the self-attention mechanism to predict channel coefficients in a per-antenna manner, which offers more flexibility to adaptively deal with dynamic numbers of PAs in practical deployment. Numerical results demonstrate that 1) the proposed deep learning-based channel estimators outperform conventional methods and exhibit excellent zero-shot learning capabilities, and 2) PAMoE delivers higher channel estimation accuracy via MoE specialization, while PAformer natively handles an arbitrary number of PAs, trading self-attention complexity for superior scalability.

Title: Bridging conformal prediction and scenario optimization
Authors: Niall O'Sullivan, Licio Romao, Kostas Margellos
Abstract: Conformal prediction and scenario optimization constitute two important classes of statistical learning frameworks to certify decisions made using data. They have found numerous applications in control theory, machine learning and robotics. Despite intense research in both areas, and apparently similar results, a clear connection between these two frameworks has not been established. By focusing on the so-called vanilla conformal prediction, we show rigorously how to choose appropriate score functions and set predictor map to recover well-known bounds on the probability of constraint violation associated with scenario programs. We also show how to treat ranking of nonconformity scores as a one-dimensional scenario program with discarded constraints, and use such connection to recover vanilla conformal prediction guarantees on the validity of the set predictor. We also capitalize on the main developments of the scenario approach, and show how we could analyze calibration conditional conformal prediction under this lens. Our results establish a theoretical bridge between conformal prediction and scenario optimization.
