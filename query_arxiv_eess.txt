Title: Closed-form Expression for the Power Profile in Wideband Systems with Inter-channel Stimulated Raman Scattering
Authors: Lucas Alves Zischler, Chiara Lasagni, Paolo Serena, Alberto Bononi, Giammarco Di Sciullo, Divya A. Shaji, Antonio Mecozzi, Cristian Antonelli
Abstract: Wideband systems experience significant inter-channel stimulated Raman scattering (ISRS) and channel-dependent losses. Due to the non-uniform attenuation profile, the combined effects of ISRS and fiber loss can only be accurately estimated using numerical methods. In this work, we present an approximate closed-form expression for the channels' power profile accounting for these combined effects. We validate the proposed expression against numerical solutions in the case of CLU transmission, showing high accuracy for both single-span and multi-span fiber-optic links. Additionally, we derive an inverse expression, formulated as a function of the output power, which can be utilized to target a desired optical signal-to-noise ratio (OSNR) profile through pre-emphasis of the launched channel powers.

Title: Melody-Lyrics Matching with Contrastive Alignment Loss
Authors: Changhong Wang, Michel Olvera, Gaël Richard
Abstract: The connection between music and lyrics is far beyond semantic bonds. Conceptual pairs in the two modalities such as rhythm and rhyme, note duration and syllabic stress, and structure correspondence, raise a compelling yet seldom-explored direction in the field of music information retrieval. In this paper, we present melody-lyrics matching (MLM), a new task which retrieves potential lyrics for a given symbolic melody from text sources. Rather than generating lyrics from scratch, MLM essentially exploits the relationships between melody and lyrics. We propose a self-supervised representation learning framework with contrastive alignment loss for melody and lyrics. This has the potential to leverage the abundance of existing songs with paired melody and lyrics. No alignment annotations are required. Additionally, we introduce sylphone, a novel representation for lyrics at syllable-level activated by phoneme identity and vowel stress. We demonstrate that our method can match melody with coherent and singable lyrics with empirical results and intuitive examples. We open source code and provide matching examples on the companion webpage: this https URL.

Title: Data-Driven Motion Planning for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Babak Esmaeili, Hamidreza Modares, Stefano Di Cairano
Abstract: This paper proposes a data-driven motion-planning framework for nonlinear systems that constructs a sequence of overlapping invariant polytopes. Around each randomly sampled waypoint, the algorithm identifies a convex admissible region and solves data-driven linear-matrix-inequality problems to learn several ellipsoidal invariant sets together with their local state-feedback gains. The convex hull of these ellipsoids, still invariant under a piece-wise-affine controller obtained by interpolating the gains, is then approximated by a polytope. Safe transitions between nodes are ensured by verifying the intersection of consecutive convex-hull polytopes and introducing an intermediate node for a smooth transition. Control gains are interpolated in real time via simplex-based interpolation, keeping the state inside the invariant polytopes throughout the motion. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on system dynamics models, our method requires only data to compute safe regions and design state-feedback controllers. The approach is validated through simulations, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed method in achieving safe, dynamically feasible paths for complex nonlinear systems.

Title: GEPAR3D: Geometry Prior-Assisted Learning for 3D Tooth Segmentation
Authors: Tomasz Szczepański, Szymon Płotka, Michal K. Grzeszczyk, Arleta Adamowicz, Piotr Fudalej, Przemysław Korzeniowski, Tomasz Trzciński, Arkadiusz Sitek
Abstract: Tooth segmentation in Cone-Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) remains challenging, especially for fine structures like root apices, which is critical for assessing root resorption in orthodontics. We introduce GEPAR3D, a novel approach that unifies instance detection and multi-class segmentation into a single step tailored to improve root segmentation. Our method integrates a Statistical Shape Model of dentition as a geometric prior, capturing anatomical context and morphological consistency without enforcing restrictive adjacency constraints. We leverage a deep watershed method, modeling each tooth as a continuous 3D energy basin encoding voxel distances to boundaries. This instance-aware representation ensures accurate segmentation of narrow, complex root apices. Trained on publicly available CBCT scans from a single center, our method is evaluated on external test sets from two in-house and two public medical centers. GEPAR3D achieves the highest overall segmentation performance, averaging a Dice Similarity Coefficient (DSC) of 95.0% (+2.8% over the second-best method) and increasing recall to 95.2% (+9.5%) across all test sets. Qualitative analyses demonstrated substantial improvements in root segmentation quality, indicating significant potential for more accurate root resorption assessment and enhanced clinical decision-making in orthodontics. We provide the implementation and dataset at this https URL.

Title: Integrating Opinion Dynamics into Safety Control for Decentralized Airplane Encounter Resolution
Authors: Shuhao Qi, Zhiqi Tang, Zhiyong Sun, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: As the airspace becomes increasingly congested, decentralized conflict resolution methods for airplane encounters have become essential. While decentralized safety controllers can prevent dangerous midair collisions, they do not always ensure prompt conflict resolution. As a result, airplane progress may be blocked for extended periods in certain situations. To address this blocking phenomenon, this paper proposes integrating bio-inspired nonlinear opinion dynamics into the airplane safety control framework, thereby guaranteeing both safety and blocking-free resolution. In particular, opinion dynamics enable the safety controller to achieve collaborative decision-making for blocking resolution and facilitate rapid, safe coordination without relying on communication or preset rules. Extensive simulation results validate the improved flight efficiency and safety guarantees. This study provides practical insights into the design of autonomous controllers for airplanes.

Title: On the Utility of Virtual Staining for Downstream Applications as it relates to Task Network Capacity
Authors: Sourya Sengupta, Jianquan Xu, Phuong Nguyen, Frank J. Brooks, Yang Liu, Mark A. Anastasio
Abstract: Virtual staining, or in-silico-labeling, has been proposed to computationally generate synthetic fluorescence images from label-free images by use of deep learning-based image-to-image translation networks. In most reported studies, virtually stained images have been assessed only using traditional image quality measures such as structural similarity or signal-to-noise ratio. However, in biomedical imaging, images are typically acquired to facilitate an image-based inference, which we refer to as a downstream biological or clinical task. This study systematically investigates the utility of virtual staining for facilitating clinically relevant downstream tasks (like segmentation or classification) with consideration of the capacity of the deep neural networks employed to perform the tasks. Comprehensive empirical evaluations were conducted using biological datasets, assessing task performance by use of label-free, virtually stained, and ground truth fluorescence images. The results demonstrated that the utility of virtual staining is largely dependent on the ability of the segmentation or classification task network to extract meaningful task-relevant information, which is related to the concept of network capacity. Examples are provided in which virtual staining does not improve, or even degrades, segmentation or classification performance when the capacity of the associated task network is sufficiently large. The results demonstrate that task network capacity should be considered when deciding whether to perform virtual staining.

Title: Adaptive Compensation of Nonlinear Friction in Mechanical Systems Without Velocity Measurement
Authors: Jose Guadalupe Romero, Romeo Ortega, Leyan Fang, Alexey Bobtsov
Abstract: Friction is an unavoidable phenomenon that exists in all mechanical systems incorporating parts with relative motion. It is well-known that friction is a serious impediment for precise servo control, hence the interest to devise a procedure to compensate for it -- a subject that has been studied by many researchers for many years. The vast majority of friction compensation schemes reported in the literature rely on the availability of velocity measurements, an information that is hard to obtain. A second limitation of the existing procedures is that they rely on mathematical models of friction that contain several unknown parameters, some of them entering nonlinearly in the dynamic equations. In this paper we propose a globally convergent tracking controller for a mechanical system perturbed by static and Coulomb friction, which is a reliable mathematical model of the friction phenomenon, that does not rely one measurement of velocity. The key component is an immersion and invariance-based adaptive speed observer, used for the friction compensation. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first globally convergent solution to this challenging problem. We also present simulation results of the application of our observer for systems affected by friction, which is described by the more advanced LuGre model.

Title: Optimal Messaging Strategy for Incentivizing Agents in Dynamic Systems
Authors: Renyan Sun, Ashutosh Nayyar
Abstract: We consider a finite-horizon discrete-time dynamic system jointly controlled by a designer and one or more agents, where the designer can influence the agents' actions through selective information disclosure. At each time step, the designer sends a message to the agent(s) from a prespecified message space. The designer may also take an action that directly influences system dynamics and rewards. Each agent uses its received message (and its own information) to choose its action. We are interested in the setting where the designer would like to incentivize each agent to play a specific strategy. We consider a notion of incentive compatibility that is based on sequential rationality at each realization of the common information between the designer and the agent(s). Our objective is to find a messaging and action strategy for the designer that maximizes its total expected reward while incentivizing each agent to follow a prespecified strategy. Under certain assumptions on the information structure of the problem, we show that an optimal designer strategy can be computed using a backward inductive algorithm that solves a family of linear programs.

Title: Weakly Supervised Intracranial Aneurysm Detection and Segmentation in MR angiography via Multi-task UNet with Vesselness Prior
Authors: Erin Rainville, Amirhossein Rasoulian, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao
Abstract: Intracranial aneurysms (IAs) are abnormal dilations of cerebral blood vessels that, if ruptured, can lead to life-threatening consequences. However, their small size and soft contrast in radiological scans often make it difficult to perform accurate and efficient detection and morphological analyses, which are critical in the clinical care of the disorder. Furthermore, the lack of large public datasets with voxel-wise expert annotations pose challenges for developing deep learning algorithms to address the issues. Therefore, we proposed a novel weakly supervised 3D multi-task UNet that integrates vesselness priors to jointly perform aneurysm detection and segmentation in time-of-flight MR angiography (TOF-MRA). Specifically, to robustly guide IA detection and segmentation, we employ the popular Frangi's vesselness filter to derive soft cerebrovascular priors for both network input and an attention block to conduct segmentation from the decoder and detection from an auxiliary branch. We train our model on the Lausanne dataset with coarse ground truth segmentation, and evaluate it on the test set with refined labels from the same database. To further assess our model's generalizability, we also validate it externally on the ADAM dataset. Our results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed technique over the SOTA techniques for aneurysm segmentation (Dice = 0.614, 95%HD =1.38mm) and detection (false positive rate = 1.47, sensitivity = 92.9%).

Title: Ambisonics Super-Resolution Using A Waveform-Domain Neural Network
Authors: Ismael Nawfal, Symeon Delikaris Manias, Mehrez Souden, Juha Merimaa, Joshua Atkins, Elisabeth McMullin, Shadi Pirhosseinloo, Daniel Phillips
Abstract: Ambisonics is a spatial audio format describing a sound field. First-order Ambisonics (FOA) is a popular format comprising only four channels. This limited channel count comes at the expense of spatial accuracy. Ideally one would be able to take the efficiency of a FOA format without its limitations. We have devised a data-driven spatial audio solution that retains the efficiency of the FOA format but achieves quality that surpasses conventional renderers. Utilizing a fully convolutional time-domain audio neural network (Conv-TasNet), we created a solution that takes a FOA input and provides a higher order Ambisonics (HOA) output. This data driven approach is novel when compared to typical physics and psychoacoustic based renderers. Quantitative evaluations showed a 0.6dB average positional mean squared error difference between predicted and actual 3rd order HOA. The median qualitative rating showed an 80% improvement in perceived quality over the traditional rendering approach.

Title: RIS-MAE: A Self-Supervised Modulation Classification Method Based on Raw IQ Signals and Masked Autoencoder
Authors: Yunfei Liu, Mingxuan Liu, Wupeng Xie, Xinzhu Liu, Wenxue Liu, Yangang Sun, Xin Qiu, Cui Yuan, Jinhai Li
Abstract: Automatic modulation classification (AMC) is a basic technology in intelligent wireless communication systems. It is important for tasks such as spectrum monitoring, cognitive radio, and secure communications. In recent years, deep learning methods have made great progress in AMC. However, mainstream methods still face two key problems. First, they often use time-frequency images instead of raw signals. This causes loss of key modulation features and reduces adaptability to different communication conditions. Second, most methods rely on supervised learning. This needs a large amount of labeled data, which is hard to get in real-world environments. To solve these problems, we propose a self-supervised learning framework called RIS-MAE. RIS-MAE uses masked autoencoders to learn signal features from unlabeled data. It takes raw IQ sequences as input. By applying random masking and reconstruction, it captures important time-domain features such as amplitude, phase, etc. This helps the model learn useful and transferable representations. RIS-MAE is tested on four datasets. The results show that it performs better than existing methods in few-shot and cross-domain tasks. Notably, it achieves high classification accuracy on previously unseen datasets with only a small number of fine-tuning samples, confirming its generalization ability and potential for real-world deployment.

Title: Neural Co-state Projection Regulator: A Model-free Paradigm for Real-time Optimal Control with Input Constraints
Authors: Lihan Lian, Uduak Inyang-Udoh
Abstract: Learning-based approaches, notably Reinforcement Learning (RL), have shown promise for solving optimal control tasks without explicit system models. However, these approaches are often sample-inefficient, sensitive to reward design and hyperparameters, and prone to poor generalization, especially under input constraints. To address these challenges, we introduce the neural co-state projection regulator (NCPR), a model-free learning-based optimal control framework that is grounded in Pontryagin's Minimum Principle (PMP) and capable of solving quadratic regulator problems in nonlinear control-affine systems with input constraints. In this framework, a neural network (NN) is trained in a self-supervised setting to take the current state of the system as input and predict a finite-horizon trajectory of projected co-states (i.e., the co-state weighted by the system's input gain). Subsequently, only the first element of the NN's prediction is extracted to solve a lightweight quadratic program (QP). This workflow is executed in a feedback control setting, allowing real-time computation of control actions that satisfy both input constraints and first-order optimality conditions. We test the proposed learning-based model-free quadratic regulator on (1) a unicycle model robot reference tracking problem and (2) a pendulum swing-up task. For comparison, reinforcement learning is used on both tasks; and for context, a model-based controller is used in the unicycle model example. Our method demonstrates superior generalizability in terms of both unseen system states and varying input constraints, and also shows improved sampling efficiency.

Title: Beamformed 360° Sound Maps: U-Net-Driven Acoustic Source Segmentation and Localization
Authors: Belman Jahir Rodriguez, Sergio F. Chevtchenko, Marcelo Herrera Martinez, Yeshwant Bethy, Saeed Afshar
Abstract: We introduce a U-net model for 360° acoustic source localization formulated as a spherical semantic segmentation task. Rather than regressing discrete direction-of-arrival (DoA) angles, our model segments beamformed audio maps (azimuth and elevation) into regions of active sound presence. Using delay-and-sum (DAS) beamforming on a custom 24-microphone array, we generate signals aligned with drone GPS telemetry to create binary supervision masks. A modified U-Net, trained on frequency-domain representations of these maps, learns to identify spatially distributed source regions while addressing class imbalance via the Tversky loss. Because the network operates on beamformed energy maps, the approach is inherently array-independent and can adapt to different microphone configurations without retraining from scratch. The segmentation outputs are post-processed by computing centroids over activated regions, enabling robust DoA estimates. Our dataset includes real-world open-field recordings of a DJI Air 3 drone, synchronized with 360° video and flight logs across multiple dates and locations. Experimental results show that U-net generalizes across environments, providing improved angular precision, offering a new paradigm for dense spatial audio understanding beyond traditional Sound Source Localization (SSL).

Title: Model-Driven Deep Learning Enhanced Joint Beamforming and Mode Switching for RDARS-Aided MIMO Systems
Authors: Chengwang Ji, Kehui Li, Haiquan Lu, Qiaoyan Peng, Jintao Wang, Shaodan Ma
Abstract: Reconfigurable distributed antenna and reflecting surface (RDARS) is a promising architecture for future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. In particular, the dynamic working mode configuration for the RDARS-aided system brings an extra selection gain compared to the existing reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided system and distributed antenna system (DAS). In this paper, we consider the RDARS-aided downlink multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system and aim to maximize the weighted sum rate (WSR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming matrices at the based station (BS) and RDARS, as well as mode switching matrix at RDARS. The optimization problem is challenging to be solved due to the non-convex objective function and mixed integer binary constraint. To this end, a penalty term-based weight minimum mean square error (PWM) algorithm is proposed by integrating the majorization-minimization (MM) and weight minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods. To further escape the local optimum point in the PWM algorithm, a model-driven DL method is integrated into this algorithm, where the key variables related to the convergence of PWM algorithm are trained to accelerate the convergence speed and improve the system performance. Simulation results are provided to show that the PWM-based beamforming network (PWM-BFNet) can reduce the number of iterations by half and achieve performance improvements of 26.53% and 103.2% at the scenarios of high total transmit power and a large number of RDARS transmit elements (TEs), respectively.

Title: STAR-RIS-aided RSMA for the URLLC multi-user MIMO Downlink
Authors: Mohammad Soleymani, Ignacio Santamaria, Eduard Jorswieck, Robert Schober, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Rate splitting multiple access (RSMA) is intrinsically amalgamated with simultaneously transmitting and reflecting (STAR) reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) to enhance energy efficiency (EE) of the finite block length (FBL) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) downlink. An alternating optimization-based algorithm is proposed to jointly optimize the transmit beamforming matrices, STAR-RIS configurations, and rate-splitting parameters. STAR-RIS attains 360-degree full-plane coverage, while RSMA provides a prominent gain by efficiently managing interference. Numerical results reveal a strong synergy between RSMA and STAR-RIS, demonstreating significant EE gains over reflective RIS and spatial division multiple access (SDMA).

Title: Diffusion-Based User-Guided Data Augmentation for Coronary Stenosis Detection
Authors: Sumin Seo, In Kyu Lee, Hyun-Woo Kim, Jaesik Min, Chung-Hwan Jung
Abstract: Coronary stenosis is a major risk factor for ischemic heart events leading to increased mortality, and medical treatments for this condition require meticulous, labor-intensive analysis. Coronary angiography provides critical visual cues for assessing stenosis, supporting clinicians in making informed decisions for diagnosis and treatment. Recent advances in deep learning have shown great potential for automated localization and severity measurement of stenosis. In real-world scenarios, however, the success of these competent approaches is often hindered by challenges such as limited labeled data and class imbalance. In this study, we propose a novel data augmentation approach that uses an inpainting method based on a diffusion model to generate realistic lesions, allowing user-guided control of severity. Extensive evaluation on lesion detection and severity classification across various synthetic dataset sizes shows superior performance of our method on both a large-scale in-house dataset and a public coronary angiography dataset. Furthermore, our approach maintains high detection and classification performance even when trained with limited data, highlighting its clinical importance in improving the assessment of severity of stenosis and optimizing data utilization for more reliable decision support.

Title: When Vision-Language Model (VLM) Meets Beam Prediction: A Multimodal Contrastive Learning Framework
Authors: Ji Wang, Bin Tang, Jian Xiao, Qimei Cui, Xingwang Li, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: As the real propagation environment becomes in creasingly complex and dynamic, millimeter wave beam prediction faces huge challenges. However, the powerful cross modal representation capability of vision-language model (VLM) provides a promising approach. The traditional methods that rely on real-time channel state information (CSI) are computationally expensive and often fail to maintain accuracy in such environments. In this paper, we present a VLM-driven contrastive learning based multimodal beam prediction framework that integrates multimodal data via modality-specific encoders. To enforce cross-modal consistency, we adopt a contrastive pretraining strategy to align image and LiDAR features in the latent space. We use location information as text prompts and connect it to the text encoder to introduce language modality, which further improves cross-modal consistency. Experiments on the DeepSense-6G dataset show that our VLM backbone provides additional semantic grounding. Compared with existing methods, the overall distance-based accuracy score (DBA-Score) of 0.9016, corresponding to 1.46% average improvement.

Title: Wavelet-Based Time-Frequency Fingerprinting for Feature Extraction of Traditional Irish Music
Authors: Noah Shore
Abstract: This work presents a wavelet-based approach to time-frequency fingerprinting for time series feature extraction, with a focus on audio identification from live recordings of traditional Irish tunes. The challenges of identifying features in time-series data are addressed by employing a continuous wavelet transform to extract spectral features and wavelet coherence analysis is used to compare recorded audio spectrograms to synthetically generated tunes. The synthetic tunes are derived from ABC notation, which is a common symbolic representation for Irish music. Experimental results demonstrate that the wavelet-based method can accurately and efficiently identify recorded tunes. This research study also details the performance of the wavelet coherence model, highlighting its strengths over other methods of time-frequency decomposition. Additionally, we discuss and deploy the model on several applications beyond music, including in EEG signal analysis and financial time series forecasting.

Title: Feasibility of Extracting Skin Nerve Activity from Electrocardiogram Recorded at A Low Sampling Frequency
Authors: Youngsun Kong, Farnoush Baghestani, I-Ping Chen, Ki Chon
Abstract: Skin nerve activity (SKNA) derived from electrocardiogram (ECG) signals has been a promising non-invasive surrogate for accurate and effective assessment of the sympathetic nervous system (SNS). Typically, SKNA extraction requires a higher sampling frequency than the typical ECG recording requirement (> 2 kHz) because analysis tools extract SKNA from the 0.5-1 kHz frequency band. However, ECG recording systems commonly provide a sampling frequency of 1 kHz or lower, particularly for wearable devices. Our recent power spectral analysis exhibited that 150-500 Hz frequency bands are dominant during sympathetic stimulation. Therefore, we hypothesize that SKNA can be extracted from ECG sampled at a lower sampling frequency. We collected ECG signals from 16 participants during SNS stimulation and resampled the signals at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our statistical analyses of significance, classification performance, and reliability indicate no significant difference between SKNA indices derived from ECG signals sampled at 0.5, 1, and 4 kHz. Our findings indicate that conventional ECG devices, which are limited to low sampling rates due to resource constraints or outdated guidelines, can be used to reliably collect SKNA if muscle artifact contamination is minimal.

Title: VR-PTOLEMAIC: A Virtual Environment for the Perceptual Testing of Spatial Audio Algorithms
Authors: Paolo Ostan, Francesca Del Gaudio, Federico Miotello, Mirco Pezzoli, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: The perceptual evaluation of spatial audio algorithms is an important step in the development of immersive audio applications, as it ensures that synthesized sound fields meet quality standards in terms of listening experience, spatial perception and auditory realism. To support these evaluations, virtual reality can offer a powerful platform by providing immersive and interactive testing environments. In this paper, we present VR-PTOLEMAIC, a virtual reality evaluation system designed for assessing spatial audio algorithms. The system implements the MUSHRA (MUlti-Stimulus test with Hidden Reference and Anchor) evaluation methodology into a virtual environment. In particular, users can position themselves in each of the 25 simulated listening positions of a virtually recreated seminar room and evaluate simulated acoustic responses with respect to the actually recorded second-order ambisonic room impulse responses, all convolved with various source signals. We evaluated the usability of the proposed framework through an extensive testing campaign in which assessors were asked to compare the reconstruction capabilities of various sound field reconstruction algorithms. Results show that the VR platform effectively supports the assessment of spatial audio algorithms, with generally positive feedback on user experience and immersivity.

Title: Dynamic Real-Time Ambisonics Order Adaptation for Immersive Networked Music Performances
Authors: Paolo Ostan, Carlo Centofanti, Mirco Pezzoli, Alberto Bernardini, Claudia Rinaldi, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: Advanced remote applications such as Networked Music Performance (NMP) require solutions to guarantee immersive real-world-like interaction among users. Therefore, the adoption of spatial audio formats, such as Ambisonics, is fundamental to let the user experience an immersive acoustic scene. The accuracy of the sound scene reproduction increases with the order of the Ambisonics enconding, resulting in an improved immersivity at the cost of a greater number of audio channels, which in turn escalates both bandwidth requirements and susceptibility to network impairments (e.g., latency, jitter, and packet loss). These factors pose a significant challenge for interactive music sessions, which demand high spatial fidelity and low end-to-end delay. We propose a real-time adaptive higher-order Ambisonics strategy that continuously monitors network throughput and dynamically scales the Ambisonics order. When available bandwidth drops below a preset threshold, the order is lowered to prevent audio dropouts; it then reverts to higher orders once conditions recover, thus balancing immersion and reliability. A MUSHRA-based evaluation indicates that this adaptive approach is promising to guarantee user experience in bandwidth-limited NMP scenarios.

Title: Subband Architecture Aided Selective Fixed-Filter Active Noise Control
Authors: Hong-Cheng Liang, Man-Wai Mak, Kong Aik Lee
Abstract: The feedforward selective fixed-filter method selects the most suitable pre-trained control filter based on the spectral features of the detected reference signal, effectively avoiding slow convergence in conventional adaptive algorithms. However, it can only handle limited types of noises, and the performance degrades when the input noise exhibits non-uniform power spectral density. To address these limitations, this paper devises a novel selective fixed-filter scheme based on a delayless subband structure. In the off-line training stage, subband control filters are pre-trained for different frequency ranges and stored in a dedicated sub-filter database. During the on-line control stage, the incoming noise is decomposed using a polyphase FFT filter bank, and a frequency-band-matching mechanism assigns each subband signal the most appropriate control filter. Subsequently, a weight stacking technique is employed to combine all subband weights into a fullband filter, enabling real-time noise suppression. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed scheme provides fast convergence, effective noise reduction, and strong robustness in handling more complicated noisy environments.

Title: Low-dimensional observer design for stable linear systems by model reduction
Authors: M.F. Shakib, M. Khalil, R. Postoyan
Abstract: This paper presents a low-dimensional observer design for stable, single-input single-output, continuous-time linear time-invariant (LTI) systems. Leveraging the model reduction by moment matching technique, we approximate the system with a reduced-order model. Based on this reduced-order model, we design a low-dimensional observer that estimates the states of the original system. We show that this observer establishes exact asymptotic state reconstruction for a given class of inputs tied to the observer's dimension. Furthermore, we establish an exponential input-to-state stability property for generic inputs, ensuring a bounded estimation error. Numerical simulations confirm the effectiveness of the approach for a benchmark model reduction problem.

Title: Cyber-Physical Co-Simulation of Load Frequency Control under Load-Altering Attacks
Authors: Michał Forystek, Andrew D. Syrmakesis, Alkistis Kontou, Panos Kotsampopoulos, Nikos D. Hatziargyriou, Charalambos Konstantinou
Abstract: Integrating Information and Communications Technology (ICT) devices into the power grid brings many benefits. However, it also exposes the grid to new potential cyber threats. Many control and protection mechanisms, such as Load Frequency Control (LFC), responsible for maintaining nominal frequency during load fluctuations and Under Frequency Load Shedding (UFLS) disconnecting portion of the load during an emergency, are dependent on information exchange through the communication network. The recently emerging Load Altering Attacks (LAAs) utilize a botnet of high-wattage devices to introduce load fluctuation. In their dynamic form (DLAAs), they manipulate the load in response to live grid frequency measurements for increased efficiency, posing a notable threat to grid stability. Recognizing the importance of communication networks in power grid cyber security research, this paper presents an open-source co-simulation environment that models the power grid with the corresponding communication network, implementing grid protective mechanisms. This setup allows the comprehensive analysis of the attacks in concrete LFC and UFLS scenarios.

Title: FMPlug: Plug-In Foundation Flow-Matching Priors for Inverse Problems
Authors: Yuxiang Wan, Ryan Devera, Wenjie Zhang, Ju Sun
Abstract: We present FMPlug, a novel plug-in framework that enhances foundation flow-matching (FM) priors for solving ill-posed inverse problems. Unlike traditional approaches that rely on domain-specific or untrained priors, FMPlug smartly leverages two simple but powerful insights: the similarity between observed and desired objects and the Gaussianity of generative flows. By introducing a time-adaptive warm-up strategy and sharp Gaussianity regularization, FMPlug unlocks the true potential of domain-agnostic foundation models. Our method beats state-of-the-art methods that use foundation FM priors by significant margins, on image super-resolution and Gaussian deblurring.

Title: Petri Net Modeling and Deadlock-Free Scheduling of Attachable Heterogeneous AGV Systems
Authors: Boyu Li, Zhengchen Li, Weimin Wu, Mengchu Zhou
Abstract: The increasing demand for automation and flexibility drives the widespread adoption of heterogeneous automated guided vehicles (AGVs). This work intends to investigate a new scheduling problem in a material transportation system consisting of attachable heterogeneous AGVs, namely carriers and shuttles. They can flexibly attach to and detach from each other to cooperatively execute complex transportation tasks. While such collaboration enhances operational efficiency, the attachment-induced synchronization and interdependence render the scheduling coupled and susceptible to deadlock. To tackle this challenge, Petri nets are introduced to model AGV schedules, well describing the concurrent and sequential task execution and carrier-shuttle synchronization. Based on Petri net theory, a firing-driven decoding method is proposed, along with deadlock detection and prevention strategies to ensure deadlock-free schedules. Furthermore, a Petri net-based metaheuristic is developed in an adaptive large neighborhood search framework and incorporates an effective acceleration method to enhance computational efficiency. Finally, numerical experiments using real-world industrial data validate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithm against the scheduling policy applied in engineering practice, an exact solver, and four state-of-the-art metaheuristics. A sensitivity analysis is also conducted to provide managerial insights.

Title: AI-Driven Collaborative Satellite Object Detection for Space Sustainability
Authors: Peng Hu, Wenxuan Zhang
Abstract: The growing density of satellites in low-Earth orbit (LEO) presents serious challenges to space sustainability, primarily due to the increased risk of in-orbit collisions. Traditional ground-based tracking systems are constrained by latency and coverage limitations, underscoring the need for onboard, vision-based space object detection (SOD) capabilities. In this paper, we propose a novel satellite clustering framework that enables the collaborative execution of deep learning (DL)-based SOD tasks across multiple satellites. To support this approach, we construct a high-fidelity dataset simulating imaging scenarios for clustered satellite formations. A distance-aware viewpoint selection strategy is introduced to optimize detection performance, and recent DL models are used for evaluation. Experimental results show that the clustering-based method achieves competitive detection accuracy compared to single-satellite and existing approaches, while maintaining a low size, weight, and power (SWaP) footprint. These findings underscore the potential of distributed, AI-enabled in-orbit systems to enhance space situational awareness and contribute to long-term space sustainability.

Title: Learning to optimize with guarantees: a complete characterization of linearly convergent algorithms
Authors: Andrea Martin, Ian R. Manchester, Luca Furieri
Abstract: In high-stakes engineering applications, optimization algorithms must come with provable worst-case guarantees over a mathematically defined class of problems. Designing for the worst case, however, inevitably sacrifices performance on the specific problem instances that often occur in practice. We address the problem of augmenting a given linearly convergent algorithm to improve its average-case performance on a restricted set of target problems - for example, tailoring an off-the-shelf solver for model predictive control (MPC) for an application to a specific dynamical system - while preserving its worst-case guarantees across the entire problem class. Toward this goal, we characterize the class of algorithms that achieve linear convergence for classes of nonsmooth composite optimization problems. In particular, starting from a baseline linearly convergent algorithm, we derive all - and only - the modifications to its update rule that maintain its convergence properties. Our results apply to augmenting legacy algorithms such as gradient descent for nonconvex, gradient-dominated functions; Nesterov's accelerated method for strongly convex functions; and projected methods for optimization over polyhedral feasibility sets. We showcase effectiveness of the approach on solving optimization problems with tight iteration budgets in application to ill-conditioned systems of linear equations and MPC for linear systems.

Abstract: With its wide coverage and uninterrupted service, satellite communication is a critical technology for next-generation 6G communications. High throughput satellite (HTS) systems, utilizing multipoint beam and frequency multiplexing techniques, enable satellite communication capacity of up to Tbps to meet the growing traffic demand. Therefore, it is imperative to review the-state-of-the-art of multibeam HTS systems and identify their associated challenges and perspectives. Firstly, we summarize the multibeam HTS hardware foundations, including ground station systems, on-board payloads, and user terminals. Subsequently, we review the flexible on-board radio resource allocation approaches of bandwidth, power, time slot, and joint allocation schemes of HTS systems to optimize resource utilization and cater to non-uniform service demand. Additionally, we survey multibeam precoding methods for the HTS system to achieve full-frequency reuse and interference cancellation, which are classified according to different deployments such as single gateway precoding, multiple gateway precoding, on-board precoding, and hybrid on-board/on-ground precoding. Finally, we disscuss the challenges related to Q/V band link outage, time and frequency synchronization of gateways, the accuracy of channel state information (CSI), payload light-weight development, and the application of deep learning (DL). Research on these topics will contribute to enhancing the performance of HTS systems and finally delivering high-speed data to areas underserved by terrestrial networks.

Title: AoI-Aware Resource Allocation with Deep Reinforcement Learning for HAPS-V2X Networks
Authors: Ahmet Melih Ince, Ayse Elif Canbilen, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: Sixth-generation (6G) networks are designed to meet the hyper-reliable and low-latency communication (HRLLC) requirements of safety-critical applications such as autonomous driving. Integrating non-terrestrial networks (NTN) into the 6G infrastructure brings redundancy to the network, ensuring continuity of communications even under extreme conditions. In particular, high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) stand out for their wide coverage and low latency advantages, supporting communication reliability and enhancing information freshness, especially in rural areas and regions with infrastructure constraints. In this paper, we present reinforcement learning-based approaches using deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) to dynamically optimize the age-of-information (AoI) in HAPS-enabled vehicle-to-everything (V2X) networks. The proposed method improves information freshness and overall network reliability by enabling independent learning without centralized coordination. The findings reveal the potential of HAPS-supported solutions, combined with DDPG-based learning, for efficient AoI-aware resource allocation in platoon-based autonomous vehicle systems.

Title: Hyperproperty-Constrained Secure Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Ernest Bonnah, Luan Viet Nguyen, Khaza Anuarul Hoque
Abstract: Hyperproperties for Time Window Temporal Logic (HyperTWTL) is a domain-specific formal specification language known for its effectiveness in compactly representing security, opacity, and concurrency properties for robotics applications. This paper focuses on HyperTWTL-constrained secure reinforcement learning (SecRL). Although temporal logic-constrained safe reinforcement learning (SRL) is an evolving research problem with several existing literature, there is a significant research gap in exploring security-aware reinforcement learning (RL) using hyperproperties. Given the dynamics of an agent as a Markov Decision Process (MDP) and opacity/security constraints formalized as HyperTWTL, we propose an approach for learning security-aware optimal policies using dynamic Boltzmann softmax RL while satisfying the HyperTWTL constraints. The effectiveness and scalability of our proposed approach are demonstrated using a pick-up and delivery robotic mission case study. We also compare our results with two other baseline RL algorithms, showing that our proposed method outperforms them.

Title: DeformTune: A Deformable XAI Music Prototype for Non-Musicians
Authors: Ziqing Xu, Nick Bryan-Kinns
Abstract: Many existing AI music generation tools rely on text prompts, complex interfaces, or instrument-like controls, which may require musical or technical knowledge that non-musicians do not possess. This paper introduces DeformTune, a prototype system that combines a tactile deformable interface with the MeasureVAE model to explore more intuitive, embodied, and explainable AI interaction. We conducted a preliminary study with 11 adult participants without formal musical training to investigate their experience with AI-assisted music creation. Thematic analysis of their feedback revealed recurring challenge--including unclear control mappings, limited expressive range, and the need for guidance throughout use. We discuss several design opportunities for enhancing explainability of AI, including multimodal feedback and progressive interaction support. These findings contribute early insights toward making AI music systems more explainable and empowering for novice users.

Title: DiSC-Med: Diffusion-based Semantic Communications for Robust Medical Image Transmission
Authors: Fupei Guo, Hao Zheng, Xiang Zhang, Li Chen, Yue Wang, Songyang Zhang
Abstract: The rapid development of artificial intelligence has driven smart health with next-generation wireless communication technologies, stimulating exciting applications in remote diagnosis and intervention. To enable a timely and effective response for remote healthcare, efficient transmission of medical data through noisy channels with limited bandwidth emerges as a critical challenge. In this work, we propose a novel diffusion-based semantic communication framework, namely DiSC-Med, for the medical image transmission, where medical-enhanced compression and denoising blocks are developed for bandwidth efficiency and robustness, respectively. Unlike conventional pixel-wise communication framework, our proposed DiSC-Med is able to capture the key semantic information and achieve superior reconstruction performance with ultra-high bandwidth efficiency against noisy channels. Extensive experiments on real-world medical datasets validate the effectiveness of our framework, demonstrating its potential for robust and efficient telehealth applications.

Title: A Practical Finite Element Approach for Simulating Dynamic Crack Growth in Cu/Ultra Low-k Interconnect Structures
Authors: Yuxi Xie, Ethan J. Wu, Lu Xu, Jimmy Perez, Shaofan Li
Abstract: This work presents a practical finite element modeling strategy, the Crack Element Method (CEM), for simulating the dynamic crack propagation in two-dimensional structures. The method employs an element-splitting algorithm based on the Edge-based Smoothed Finite Element Method (ES-FEM) to capture the element-wise crack growth while reducing the formation of poorly shaped elements that can compromise numerical accuracy and computational performance. A fracture energy release rate formulation is also developed based on the evolving topology of the split elements. The proposed approach is validated through a series of classical benchmark problems, demonstrating its accuracy and robustness in addressing dynamic fracture scenarios. Finally, the applicability of the CEM is illustrated in a case study involving patterned Cu/Ultra Low-k interconnect structures.

Title: Audio Prototypical Network For Controllable Music Recommendation
Authors: Fırat Öncel, Emiliano Penaloza, Haolun Wu, Shubham Gupta, Mirco Ravanelli, Laurent Charlin, Cem Subakan
Abstract: Traditional recommendation systems represent user preferences in dense representations obtained through black-box encoder models. While these models often provide strong recommendation performance, they lack interpretability for users, leaving users unable to understand or control the system's modeling of their preferences. This limitation is especially challenging in music recommendation, where user preferences are highly personal and often evolve based on nuanced qualities like mood, genre, tempo, or instrumentation. In this paper, we propose an audio prototypical network for controllable music recommendation. This network expresses user preferences in terms of prototypes representative of semantically meaningful features pertaining to musical qualities. We show that the model obtains competitive recommendation performance compared to popular baseline models while also providing interpretable and controllable user profiles.

Title: Robust Classification under Noisy Labels: A Geometry-Aware Reliability Framework for Foundation Models
Authors: Ecem Bozkurt, Antonio Ortega
Abstract: Foundation models (FMs) pretrained on large datasets have become fundamental for various downstream machine learning tasks, in particular in scenarios where obtaining perfectly labeled data is prohibitively expensive. In this paper, we assume an FM has to be fine-tuned with noisy data and present a two-stage framework to ensure robust classification in the presence of label noise without model retraining. Recent work has shown that simple k-nearest neighbor (kNN) approaches using an embedding derived from an FM can achieve good performance even in the presence of severe label noise. Our work is motivated by the fact that these methods make use of local geometry. In this paper, following a similar two-stage procedure, reliability estimation followed by reliability-weighted inference, we show that improved performance can be achieved by introducing geometry information. For a given instance, our proposed inference uses a local neighborhood of training data, obtained using the non-negative kernel (NNK) neighborhood construction. We propose several methods for reliability estimation that can rely less on distance and local neighborhood as the label noise increases. Our evaluation on CIFAR-10 and DermaMNIST shows that our methods improve robustness across various noise conditions, surpassing standard K-NN approaches and recent adaptive-neighborhood baselines.

Title: Energy Efficient Trajectory Control and Resource Allocation in Multi-UAV-assisted MEC via Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Saichao Liu, Geng Sun, Chuang Zhang, Xuejie Liu, Jiacheng Wang, Changyuan Zhao, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: Mobile edge computing (MEC) is a promising technique to improve the computational capacity of smart devices (SDs) in Internet of Things (IoT). However, the performance of MEC is restricted due to its fixed location and limited service scope. Hence, we investigate an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-assisted MEC system, where multiple UAVs are dispatched and each UAV can simultaneously provide computing service for multiple SDs. To improve the performance of system, we formulated a UAV-based trajectory control and resource allocation multi-objective optimization problem (TCRAMOP) to simultaneously maximize the offloading number of UAVs and minimize total offloading delay and total energy consumption of UAVs by optimizing the flight paths of UAVs as well as the computing resource allocated to served SDs. Then, consider that the solution of TCRAMOP requires continuous decision-making and the system is dynamic, we propose an enhanced deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm, namely, distributed proximal policy optimization with imitation learning (DPPOIL). This algorithm incorporates the generative adversarial imitation learning technique to improve the policy performance. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed DPPOIL and prove that the learned strategy of DPPOIL is better compared with other baseline methods.

Title: Advancing Speech Quality Assessment Through Scientific Challenges and Open-source Activities
Authors: Wen-Chin Huang
Abstract: Speech quality assessment (SQA) refers to the evaluation of speech quality, and developing an accurate automatic SQA method that reflects human perception has become increasingly important, in order to keep up with the generative AI boom. In recent years, SQA has progressed to a point that researchers started to faithfully use automatic SQA in research papers as a rigorous measurement of goodness for speech generation systems. We believe that the scientific challenges and open-source activities of late have stimulated the growth in this field. In this paper, we review recent challenges as well as open-source implementations and toolkits for SQA, and highlight the importance of maintaining such activities to facilitate the development of not only SQA itself but also generative AI for speech.

Title: Active IRS-Enabled Integrated Sensing and Communications with Extended Targets
Authors: Yuan Fang, Xianxin Song, Huazhou Hou, Ziguo Zhong, Xianghao Yu, Jie Xu, Yongming Huang
Abstract: This paper studies the active intelligent reflecting surface (IRS)-enabled integrated sensing and communications (ISAC), in which an active IRS is deployed to assist the base station (BS) in serving multiple communication users (CUs) and simultaneously sensing an \emph{extended} target at the non-line-of-sight (NLoS) area of the BS. The active IRS has the capability of amplifying the reflected signals so as to overcome significant reflection path loss in NLoS communication and sensing. In particular, we derive the sensing Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) for estimating the target response matrix. Accordingly, we jointly optimize the transmit beamforming at the BS and the reflective beamforming at the active IRS to minimize the sensing CRB, subject to the signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) requirements at the CUs, the transmit power budgets at the BS and active IRS, as well as the power amplification gain constraints at the active IRS. The CRB minimization problem is highly non-convex and thus difficult to solve in general. To address this challenge, we first focus on two specified conditions by considering the sensing-only scenario via ignoring the SINR constraints for communications, for which the closed-form optimal transmit beamforming is derived. Then, we propose two efficient alternating optimization (AO)-based algorithms to obtain high-quality solutions for the general ISAC scenarios. Next, we analyze the inherent relationship between the power scaling at the BS and the amplification scaling at the active IRS. It is shown that the active IRS always amplifies the signal using the maximum amplification gain under practical system settings. Finally, numerical results are provided to verify the effectiveness of the proposed AO-based algorithms and the benefits of active IRS-enabled ISAC compared to its passive IRSs counterparts.

Title: Cued-Agent: A Collaborative Multi-Agent System for Automatic Cued Speech Recognition
Authors: Guanjie Huang, Danny H.K. Tsang, Shan Yang, Guangzhi Lei, Li Liu
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) is a visual communication system that combines lip-reading with hand coding to facilitate communication for individuals with hearing impairments. Automatic CS Recognition (ACSR) aims to convert CS hand gestures and lip movements into text via AI-driven methods. Traditionally, the temporal asynchrony between hand and lip movements requires the design of complex modules to facilitate effective multimodal fusion. However, constrained by limited data availability, current methods demonstrate insufficient capacity for adequately training these fusion mechanisms, resulting in suboptimal performance. Recently, multi-agent systems have shown promising capabilities in handling complex tasks with limited data availability. To this end, we propose the first collaborative multi-agent system for ACSR, named Cued-Agent. It integrates four specialized sub-agents: a Multimodal Large Language Model-based Hand Recognition agent that employs keyframe screening and CS expert prompt strategies to decode hand movements, a pretrained Transformer-based Lip Recognition agent that extracts lip features from the input video, a Hand Prompt Decoding agent that dynamically integrates hand prompts with lip features during inference in a training-free manner, and a Self-Correction Phoneme-to-Word agent that enables post-process and end-to-end conversion from phoneme sequences to natural language sentences for the first time through semantic refinement. To support this study, we expand the existing Mandarin CS dataset by collecting data from eight hearing-impaired cuers, establishing a mixed dataset of fourteen subjects. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our Cued-Agent performs superbly in both normal and hearing-impaired scenarios compared with state-of-the-art methods. The implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: IN2OUT: Fine-Tuning Video Inpainting Model for Video Outpainting Using Hierarchical Discriminator
Authors: Sangwoo Youn, Minji Lee, Nokap Tony Park, Yeonggyoo Jeon, Taeyoung Na
Abstract: Video outpainting presents a unique challenge of extending the borders while maintaining consistency with the given content. In this paper, we suggest the use of video inpainting models that excel in object flow learning and reconstruction in outpainting rather than solely generating the background as in existing methods. However, directly applying or fine-tuning inpainting models to outpainting has shown to be ineffective, often leading to blurry results. Our extensive experiments on discriminator designs reveal that a critical component missing in the outpainting fine-tuning process is a discriminator capable of effectively assessing the perceptual quality of the extended areas. To tackle this limitation, we differentiate the objectives of adversarial training into global and local goals and introduce a hierarchical discriminator that meets both objectives. Additionally, we develop a specialized outpainting loss function that leverages both local and global features of the discriminator. Fine-tuning on this adversarial loss function enhances the generator's ability to produce both visually appealing and globally coherent outpainted scenes. Our proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art methods both quantitatively and qualitatively. Supplementary materials including the demo video and the code are available in SigPort.

Title: LO-Aware Adaptive Modulation for Rydberg Atomic Receivers
Authors: Jiuyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Rydberg atomic (RA) receivers represent a revolutionary quantum technology for wireless communications, offering unprecedented sensitivity beyond conventional radio frequency (RF) antennas. However, these receivers detect only signal amplitude, losing critical phase information. While reference signals generated by a local oscillator (LO) can assist in phase recovery, existing modulation schemes designed for conventional systems perform poorly with this quantum detection mechanism. This paper introduces a breakthrough LO-aware adaptive modulation (LOAM) scheme specifically developed for RA receivers that dynamically adapts to complex fading channel coefficients. LOAM maximizes the minimum amplitude difference between constellation points, ensuring optimal detection performance. The innovation employs an adaptive co-linear constellation architecture aligned with the combined phase of reference signal and channel coefficient. For strong reference signals, LOAM generates symmetric constellation points centered at origin; for weak signals, it adopts non-symmetric distributions. The paper mathematically derives the threshold governing these operational regimes. Simulation results reveal the transformative impact of LOAM, demonstrating performance gains exceeding 45 dB over conventional modulation schemes, including quadrature amplitude modulation (QAM), phase-shift keying (PSK), and pulse-amplitude modulation (PAM).

Title: Semantic and Temporal Integration in Latent Diffusion Space for High-Fidelity Video Super-Resolution
Authors: Yiwen Wang, Xinning Chai, Yuhong Zhang, Zhengxue Cheng, Jun Zhao, Rong Xie, Li Song
Abstract: Recent advancements in video super-resolution (VSR) models have demonstrated impressive results in enhancing low-resolution videos. However, due to limitations in adequately controlling the generation process, achieving high fidelity alignment with the low-resolution input while maintaining temporal consistency across frames remains a significant challenge. In this work, we propose Semantic and Temporal Guided Video Super-Resolution (SeTe-VSR), a novel approach that incorporates both semantic and temporal-spatio guidance in the latent diffusion space to address these challenges. By incorporating high-level semantic information and integrating spatial and temporal information, our approach achieves a seamless balance between recovering intricate details and ensuring temporal coherence. Our method not only preserves high-reality visual content but also significantly enhances fidelity. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SeTe-VSR outperforms existing methods in terms of detail recovery and perceptual quality, highlighting its effectiveness for complex video super-resolution tasks.

Title: A Novel Modeling Framework and Data Product for Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light Image Reconstruction (1986-2024)
Authors: Yihe Tian, Kwan Man Cheng, Zhengbo Zhang, Tao Zhang, Suju Li, Dongmei Yan, Bing Xu
Abstract: Artificial Night-Time Light (NTL) remote sensing is a vital proxy for quantifying the intensity and spatial distribution of human activities. Although the NPP-VIIRS sensor provides high-quality NTL observations, its temporal coverage, which begins in 2012, restricts long-term time-series studies that extend to earlier periods. Despite the progress in extending VIIRS-like NTL time-series, current methods still suffer from two significant shortcomings: the underestimation of light intensity and the structural omission. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel reconstruction framework consisting of a two-stage process: construction and refinement. The construction stage features a Hierarchical Fusion Decoder (HFD) designed to enhance the fidelity of the initial reconstruction. The refinement stage employs a Dual Feature Refiner (DFR), which leverages high-resolution impervious surface masks to guide and enhance fine-grained structural details. Based on this framework, we developed the Extended VIIRS-like Artificial Nighttime Light (EVAL) product for China, extending the standard data record backwards by 26 years to begin in 1986. Quantitative evaluation shows that EVAL significantly outperforms existing state-of-the-art products, boosting the $\text{R}^2$ from 0.68 to 0.80 while lowering the RMSE from 1.27 to 0.99. Furthermore, EVAL exhibits excellent temporal consistency and maintains a high correlation with socioeconomic parameters, confirming its reliability for long-term analysis. The resulting EVAL dataset provides a valuable new resource for the research community and is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Learning-Based Rate-Adaptive CSI Feedback for Wideband XL-MIMO Systems in the Near-Field Domain
Authors: Zhenyu Liu, Yi Ma, Rahim Tafazolli
Abstract: Accurate and efficient channel state information (CSI) feedback is crucial for unlocking the substantial spectral efficiency gains of extremely large-scale MIMO (XL-MIMO) systems in future 6G networks. However, the combination of near-field spherical wave propagation and frequency-dependent beam split effects in wideband scenarios poses significant challenges for CSI representation and compression. This paper proposes WideNLNet-CA, a rate-adaptive deep learning framework designed to enable efficient CSI feedback in wideband near-field XL-MIMO systems. WideNLNet-CA introduces a lightweight encoder-decoder architecture with multi-stage downsampling and upsampling, incorporating computationally efficient residual blocks to capture complex multi-scale channel features with reduced overhead. A novel compression ratio adaptive module with feature importance estimation is introduced to dynamically modulate feature selection based on target compression ratios, enabling flexible adaptation across a wide range of feedback rates using a single model. Evaluation results demonstrate that WideNLNet-CA consistently outperforms existing compressive sensing and deep learning-based works across various compression ratios and bandwidths, while maintaining fast inference and low model storage requirements.

Title: Organic Electrochemical Neurons: Nonlinear Tools for Complex Dynamics
Authors: Gonzalo Rivera-Sierra, Roberto Fenollosa, Juan Bisquert
Abstract: Hybrid oscillator architectures that combine feedback oscillators with self-sustained negative resistance oscillators have emerged as a promising platform for artificial neuron design. In this work, we introduce a modeling and analysis framework for amplifier-assisted organic electrochemical neurons, leveraging nonlinear dynamical systems theory. By formulating the system as coupled differential equations describing membrane voltage and internal state variables, we identify the conditions for self-sustained oscillations and characterize the resulting dynamics through nullclines, phase-space analysis, and bifurcation behavior, providing complementary insight to standard circuit-theoretic arguments of the operation of oscillators. Our simplified yet rigorous model enables tractable analysis of circuits integrating classical feedback components (e.g., operational amplifiers) with novel devices exhibiting negative differential resistance, such as organic electrochemical transistors (OECT). This approach reveals the core mechanisms behind oscillation generation, demonstrating the utility of dynamic systems theory in understanding and designing complex hybrid circuits. Beyond neuromorphic and bioelectronic applications, the proposed framework offers a generalizable foundation for developing tunable, biologically inspired oscillatory systems in sensing, signal processing, and adaptive control.

Title: Criticality-Based Dynamic Topology Optimization for Enhancing Aerial-Marine Swarm Resilience
Authors: Ruiyang Huang, Haocheng Wang, Yixuan Shen, Ning Gao, Qiang Ni, Shi Jin, Yifan Wu
Abstract: Heterogeneous marine-aerial swarm networks encounter substantial difficulties due to targeted communication disruptions and structural weaknesses in adversarial environments. This paper proposes a two-step framework to strengthen the network's resilience. Specifically, our framework combines the node prioritization based on criticality with multi-objective topology optimization. First, we design a three-layer architecture to represent structural, communication, and task dependencies of the swarm networks. Then, we introduce the SurBi-Ranking method, which utilizes graph convolutional networks, to dynamically evaluate and rank the criticality of nodes and edges in real time. Next, we apply the NSGA-III algorithm to optimize the network topology, aiming to balance communication efficiency, global connectivity, and mission success rate. Experiments demonstrate that compared to traditional methods like K-Shell, our SurBi-Ranking method identifies critical nodes and edges with greater accuracy, as deliberate attacks on these components cause more significant connectivity degradation. Furthermore, our optimization approach, when prioritizing SurBi-Ranked critical components under attack, reduces the natural connectivity degradation by around 30%, achieves higher mission success rates, and incurs lower communication reconfiguration costs, ensuring sustained connectivity and mission effectiveness across multi-phase operations.

Title: Wind Power Scenario Generation based on the Generalized Dynamic Factor Model and Generative Adversarial Network
Authors: Young-ho Cho, Hao Zhu, Duehee Lee, Ross Baldick
Abstract: For conducting resource adequacy studies, we synthesize multiple long-term wind power scenarios of distributed wind farms simultaneously by using the spatio-temporal features: spatial and temporal correlation, waveforms, marginal and ramp rates distributions of waveform, power spectral densities, and statistical characteristics. Generating the spatial correlation in scenarios requires the design of common factors for neighboring wind farms and antithetical factors for distant wind farms. The generalized dynamic factor model (GDFM) can extract the common factors through cross spectral density analysis, but it cannot closely imitate waveforms. The GAN can synthesize plausible samples representing the temporal correlation by verifying samples through a fake sample discriminator. To combine the advantages of GDFM and GAN, we use the GAN to provide a filter that extracts dynamic factors with temporal information from the observation data, and we then apply this filter in the GDFM to represent both spatial and frequency correlations of plausible waveforms. Numerical tests on the combination of GDFM and GAN have demonstrated performance improvements over competing alternatives in synthesizing wind power scenarios from Australia, better realizing plausible statistical characteristics of actual wind power compared to alternatives such as the GDFM with a filter synthesized from distributions of actual dynamic filters and the GAN with direct synthesis without dynamic factors.

Title: AudioGen-Omni: A Unified Multimodal Diffusion Transformer for Video-Synchronized Audio, Speech, and Song Generation
Authors: Le Wang, Jun Wang, Feng Deng, Chen Zhang, Kun Gai, Di Zhang
Abstract: We present AudioGen-Omni - a unified approach based on multimodal diffusion transformers (MMDit), capable of generating high-fidelity audio, speech, and songs coherently synchronized with the input video. AudioGen-Omni introduces a novel joint training paradigm that seamlessly integrates large-scale video-text-audio corpora, enabling a model capable of generating semantically rich, acoustically diverse audio conditioned on multimodal inputs and adaptable to a wide range of audio generation tasks. AudioGen-Omni employs a unified lyrics-transcription encoder that encodes graphemes and phonemes from both sung and spoken inputs into dense frame-level representations. Dense frame-level representations are fused using an AdaLN-based joint attention mechanism enhanced with phase-aligned anisotropic positional infusion (PAAPI), wherein RoPE is selectively applied to temporally structured modalities to ensure precise and robust cross-modal alignment. By unfreezing all modalities and masking missing inputs, AudioGen-Omni mitigates the semantic constraints of text-frozen paradigms, enabling effective cross-modal conditioning. This joint training approach enhances audio quality, semantic alignment, and lip-sync accuracy, while also achieving state-of-the-art results on Text-to-Audio/Speech/Song tasks. With an inference time of 1.91 seconds for 8 seconds of audio, it offers substantial improvements in both efficiency and generality.

Title: SU-ESRGAN: Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN for Super-Resolution of Satellite and Drone Imagery with Fine-Tuning for Cross Domain Evaluation
Authors: Prerana Ramkumar
Abstract: Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) have achieved realistic super-resolution (SR) of images however, they lack semantic consistency and per-pixel confidence, limiting their credibility in critical remote sensing applications such as disaster response, urban planning and agriculture. This paper introduces Semantic and Uncertainty-Aware ESRGAN (SU-ESRGAN), the first SR framework designed for satellite imagery to integrate the ESRGAN, segmentation loss via DeepLabv3 for class detail preservation and Monte Carlo dropout to produce pixel-wise uncertainty maps. The SU-ESRGAN produces results (PSNR, SSIM, LPIPS) comparable to the Baseline ESRGAN on aerial imagery. This novel model is valuable in satellite systems or UAVs that use wide field-of-view (FoV) cameras, trading off spatial resolution for coverage. The modular design allows integration in UAV data pipelines for on-board or post-processing SR to enhance imagery resulting due to motion blur, compression and sensor limitations. Further, the model is fine-tuned to evaluate its performance on cross domain applications. The tests are conducted on two drone based datasets which differ in altitude and imaging perspective. Performance evaluation of the fine-tuned models show a stronger adaptation to the Aerial Maritime Drone Dataset, whose imaging characteristics align with the training data, highlighting the importance of domain-aware training in SR-applications.

Title: Numerical Uncertainty in Linear Registration: An Experimental Study
Authors: Niusha Mirhakimi, Yohan Chatelain, Jean-Baptiste Poline, Tristan Glatard
Abstract: While linear registration is a critical step in MRI preprocessing pipelines, its numerical uncertainty is understudied. Using Monte-Carlo Arithmetic (MCA) simulations, we assessed the most commonly used linear registration tools within major software packages (SPM, FSL, and ANTs) across multiple image similarity measures, two brain templates, and both healthy control (HC, n=50) and Parkinson's Disease (PD, n=50) cohorts. Our findings highlight the influence of linear registration tools and similarity measures on numerical stability. Among the evaluated tools and with default similarity measures, SPM exhibited the highest stability. FSL and ANTs showed greater and similar ranges of variability, with ANTs demonstrating particular sensitivity to numerical perturbations that occasionally led to registration failure. Furthermore, no significant differences were observed between healthy and PD cohorts, suggesting that numerical stability analyses obtained with healthy subjects may generalise to clinical populations. Finally, we also demonstrated how numerical uncertainty measures may support automated quality control (QC) of linear registration results. Overall, our experimental results characterize the numerical stability of linear registration experimentally and can serve as a basis for future uncertainty analyses.

Title: SpA2V: Harnessing Spatial Auditory Cues for Audio-driven Spatially-aware Video Generation
Authors: Kien T. Pham, Yingqing He, Yazhou Xing, Qifeng Chen, Long Chen
Abstract: Audio-driven video generation aims to synthesize realistic videos that align with input audio recordings, akin to the human ability to visualize scenes from auditory input. However, existing approaches predominantly focus on exploring semantic information, such as the classes of sounding sources present in the audio, limiting their ability to generate videos with accurate content and spatial composition. In contrast, we humans can not only naturally identify the semantic categories of sounding sources but also determine their deeply encoded spatial attributes, including locations and movement directions. This useful information can be elucidated by considering specific spatial indicators derived from the inherent physical properties of sound, such as loudness or frequency. As prior methods largely ignore this factor, we present SpA2V, the first framework explicitly exploits these spatial auditory cues from audios to generate videos with high semantic and spatial correspondence. SpA2V decomposes the generation process into two stages: 1) Audio-guided Video Planning: We meticulously adapt a state-of-the-art MLLM for a novel task of harnessing spatial and semantic cues from input audio to construct Video Scene Layouts (VSLs). This serves as an intermediate representation to bridge the gap between the audio and video modalities. 2) Layout-grounded Video Generation: We develop an efficient and effective approach to seamlessly integrate VSLs as conditional guidance into pre-trained diffusion models, enabling VSL-grounded video generation in a training-free manner. Extensive experiments demonstrate that SpA2V excels in generating realistic videos with semantic and spatial alignment to the input audios.

Title: Online Fine-Tuning of Carbon Emission Predictions using Real-Time Recurrent Learning for State Space Models
Authors: Julian Lemmel, Manuel Kranzl, Adam Lamine, Philipp Neubauer, Radu Grosu, Sophie Neubauer
Abstract: This paper introduces a new approach for fine-tuning the predictions of structured state space models (SSMs) at inference time using real-time recurrent learning. While SSMs are known for their efficiency and long-range modeling capabilities, they are typically trained offline and remain static during deployment. Our method enables online adaptation by continuously updating model parameters in response to incoming data. We evaluate our approach for linear-recurrent-unit SSMs using a small carbon emission dataset collected from embedded automotive hardware. Experimental results show that our method consistently reduces prediction error online during inference, demonstrating its potential for dynamic, resource-constrained environments.

Title: OpenACE: An Open Benchmark for Evaluating Audio Coding Performance
Authors: Jozef Coldenhoff, Niclas Granqvist, Milos Cernak
Abstract: Audio and speech coding lack unified evaluation and open-source testing. Many candidate systems were evaluated on proprietary, non-reproducible, or small data, and machine learning-based codecs are often tested on datasets with similar distributions as trained on, which is unfairly compared to digital signal processing-based codecs that usually work well with unseen data. This paper presents a full-band audio and speech coding quality benchmark with more variable content types, including traditional open test vectors. An example use case of audio coding quality assessment is presented with open-source Opus, 3GPP's EVS, and recent ETSI's LC3 with LC3+ used in Bluetooth LE Audio profiles. Besides, quality variations of emotional speech encoding at 16 kbps are shown. The proposed open-source benchmark contributes to audio and speech coding democratization and is available at this https URL.

Title: Risk-Aware Autonomous Driving with Linear Temporal Logic Specifications
Authors: Shuhao Qi, Zengjie Zhang, Zhiyong Sun, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: Human drivers naturally balance the risks of different concerns while driving, including traffic rule violations, minor accidents, and fatalities. However, achieving the same behavior in autonomous driving systems remains an open problem. This paper extends a risk metric that has been verified in human-like driving studies to encompass more complex driving scenarios specified by linear temporal logic (LTL) that go beyond just collision risks. This extension incorporates the timing and severity of events into LTL specifications, thereby reflecting a human-like risk awareness. Without sacrificing expressivity for traffic rules, we adopt LTL specifications composed of safety and co-safety formulas, allowing the control synthesis problem to be reformulated as a reachability problem. By leveraging occupation measures, we further formulate a linear programming (LP) problem for this LTL-based risk metric. Consequently, the synthesized policy balances different types of driving risks, including both collision risks and traffic rule violations. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is validated by three typical traffic scenarios in Carla simulator.

Title: Navigating Distribution Shifts in Medical Image Analysis: A Survey
Authors: Zixian Su, Jingwei Guo, Xi Yang, Qiufeng Wang, Frans Coenen, Kaizhu Huang
Abstract: Medical Image Analysis (MedIA) has become indispensable in modern healthcare, enhancing clinical diagnostics and personalized treatment. Despite the remarkable advancements supported by deep learning (DL) technologies, their practical deployment faces challenges due to distribution shifts, where models trained on specific datasets underperform across others from varying hospitals, regions, or patient populations. To navigate this issue, researchers have been actively developing strategies to increase the adaptability and robustness of DL models, enabling their effective use in unfamiliar and diverse environments. This paper systematically reviews approaches that apply DL techniques to MedIA systems affected by distribution shifts. Unlike traditional categorizations based on technical specifications, our approach is grounded in the real-world operational constraints faced by healthcare institutions. Specifically, we categorize the existing body of work into Joint Training, Federated Learning, Fine-tuning, and Domain Generalization, with each method tailored to distinct scenarios caused by Data Accessibility, Privacy Concerns, and Collaborative Protocols. This perspective equips researchers with a nuanced understanding of how DL can be strategically deployed to address distribution shifts in MedIA, ensuring diverse and robust medical applications. By delving deeper into these topics, we highlight potential pathways for future research that not only address existing limitations but also push the boundaries of deployable MedIA technologies.

Title: DoF Analysis and Beamforming Design for Active IRS-aided Multi-user MIMO Wireless Communication in Rank-deficient Channels
Authors: Jinbing Jiang, Feng Shu, Xuehui Wang, Ke Yang, Chong Shen, Qi Zhang, Dongming Wang, Jiangzhou Wang
Abstract: Due to its ability of significantly improving data rate, intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) will be a potential crucial technique for the future generation wireless networks like 6G. In this paper, we will focus on the analysis of degree of freedom (DoF) in IRS-aided multi-user MIMO network. Firstly, the DoF upper bound of IRS-aided single-user MIMO network, i.e., the achievable maximum DoF of such a system, is derived, and the corresponding results are extended to the case of IRS-aided multiuser MIMO by using the matrix rank inequalities. In particular, in serious rank-deficient, also called low-rank, channels like line-of-sight (LoS), the network DoF may doubles over no-IRS with the help of IRS. To verify the rate performance gain from augmented DoF, three closed-form beamforming methods, null-space projection plus maximize transmit power and maximize receive power (NSP-MTP-MRP), Schmidt orthogonalization plus minimum mean square error (SO-MMSE) and two-layer leakage plus MMSE (TLL-MMSE) are proposed to achieve the maximum DoF. Simulation results shows that IRS does make a dramatic rate enhancement. For example, in a serious deficient channel, the sum-rate of the proposed TLL-MMSE aided by IRS is about twice that of no IRS. This means that IRS may achieve a significant DoF improvement in such a channel.

Authors: Mingyao Cui, Qunsong Zeng, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Rydberg Atomic REceiver (RARE) is driving a paradigm shift in electromagnetic (EM) wave measurement by harnessing the electron transition phenomenon of Rydberg atoms. Operating at the quantum scale, such receivers have the potential to breakthrough the performance limit of classic receivers, sparking a revolution in physical-layer wireless communications. The objective of this paper is to offer insights into RARE-empowered communications. We first provide a comprehensive introduction to the fundamental principles of RAREs. Then, a thorough comparison between RAREs and classic receivers is conducted in terms of the antenna size, sensitivity, and bandwidth. Subsequently, we overview the recent progresses in RARE-aided wireless communications, covering the frequency-division multiplexing, multiple-input-multiple-output, wireless sensing, and quantum many-body techniques. Moreover, the unique application of RARE in multiband sensing and communication is introduced. Finally, we conclude by providing promising research directions.

Title: Generating Novel Brain Morphology by Deforming Learned Templates
Authors: Alan Q. Wang, Fangrui Huang, Bailey Trang, Wei Peng, Mohammad Abbasi, Kilian Pohl, Mert Sabuncu, Ehsan Adeli
Abstract: Designing generative models for 3D structural brain MRI that synthesize morphologically-plausible and attribute-specific (e.g., age, sex, disease state) samples is an active area of research. Existing approaches based on frameworks like GANs or diffusion models synthesize the image directly, which may limit their ability to capture intricate morphological details. In this work, we propose a 3D brain MRI generation method based on state-of-the-art latent diffusion models (LDMs), called MorphLDM, that generates novel images by applying synthesized deformation fields to a learned template. Instead of using a reconstruction-based autoencoder (as in a typical LDM), our encoder outputs a latent embedding derived from both an image and a learned template that is itself the output of a template decoder; this latent is passed to a deformation field decoder, whose output is applied to the learned template. A registration loss is minimized between the original image and the deformed template with respect to the encoder and both decoders. Empirically, our approach outperforms generative baselines on metrics spanning image diversity, adherence with respect to input conditions, and voxel-based morphometry.

Title: Prescribed-Time Boresight Control of Spacecraft Under Pointing Constraints
Authors: Xiaodong Shao, Haoyang Yang, Haoran Li, Zongyu Zuo, Jose Guadalupe Romero, Qinglei Hu
Abstract: This article proposes an integrated boresight guidance and control (IBGC) scheme to address the boresight reorientation problem of spacecraft under temporal and pointing constraints. A $C^1$ continuous, saturated prescribed-time adjustment (PPTA) function is presented, along with the establishment of a practical prescribed-time stability criterion. Utilizing the time scale transformation technique and the PPTA function, we propose a prescribed-time guidance law that guides the boresight vector from almost any initial orientation in free space to a small neighborhood of the goal orientation within a preassigned time, while avoiding all forbidden zones augmented with safety margins. Subsequently, a prescribed-time disturbance observer (PTDO) is derived to reconstruct the external disturbances. By leveraging barrier and PPTA functions, a PTDO-based reduced-attitude tracking controller is developed, which ensures prescribed-time boresight tracking within a ``safe tube''. By judiciously setting the safety margins, settling times, and safe tube for the guidance and control laws, the proposed IBGC scheme achieves pointing-constrained boresight reorientation within a required task completion time. Simulation and experimental results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed IBGC scheme.

Title: HuiduRep: A Robust Self-Supervised Framework for Learning Neural Representations from Extracellular Recordings
Authors: Feng Cao, Zishuo Feng, Wei Shi, Jicong Zhang
Abstract: Extracellular recordings are transient voltage fluctuations in the vicinity of neurons, serving as a fundamental modality in neuroscience for decoding brain activity at single-neuron resolution. Spike sorting, the process of attributing each detected spike to its corresponding neuron, is a pivotal step in brain sensing pipelines. However, it remains challenging under low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), electrode drift, and cross-session variability. In this paper, we propose HuiduRep, a robust self-supervised representation learning framework that extracts discriminative and generalizable features from extracellular recordings. By integrating contrastive learning with a denoising autoencoder, HuiduRep learns latent representations robust to noise and drift. With HuiduRep, we develop a spike sorting pipeline that clusters spike representations without ground truth labels. Experiments on hybrid and real-world datasets demonstrate that HuiduRep achieves strong robustness. Furthermore, the pipeline significantly outperforms state-of-the-art tools such as KiloSort4 and MountainSort5 on accuracy and precision on diverse datasets. These findings demonstrate the potential of self-supervised spike representation learning as a foundational tool for robust and generalizable processing of extracellular recordings.

Title: Edge Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Network Optimisation in O-RAN
Authors: Abdelaziz Salama, Zeinab Nezami, Mohammed M. H. Qazzaz, Maryam Hafeez, Syed Ali Raza Zaidi
Abstract: The deployment of AI agents within legacy Radio Access Network (RAN) infrastructure poses significant safety and reliability challenges for future 6G networks. This paper presents a novel Edge AI framework for autonomous network optimisation in Open RAN environments, addressing these challenges through three core innovations: (1) a persona-based multi-tools architecture enabling distributed, context-aware decision-making; (2) proactive anomaly detection agent powered by traffic predictive tool; and (3) a safety, aligned reward mechanism that balances performance with operational stability. Integrated into the RAN Intelligent Controller (RIC), our framework leverages multimodal data fusion, including network KPIs, a traffic prediction model, and external information sources, to anticipate and respond to dynamic network conditions. Extensive evaluation using realistic 5G scenarios demonstrates that the edge framework achieves zero network outages under high-stress conditions, compared to 8.4% for traditional fixed-power networks and 3.3% for large language model (LLM) agent-based approaches, while maintaining near real-time responsiveness and consistent QoS. These results establish that, when equipped with the right tools and contextual awareness, AI agents can be safely and effectively deployed in critical network infrastructure, laying the framework for intelligent and autonomous 5G and beyond network operations.

Authors: Ashkan Moradi, Fadila Zerka, Joeran S. Bosma, Mohammed R. S. Sunoqrot, Bendik S. Abrahamsen, Derya Yakar, Jeroen Geerdink, Henkjan Huisman, Tone Frost Bathen, Mattijs Elschot
Abstract: Purpose: To develop and optimize a federated learning (FL) framework across multiple clients for biparametric MRI prostate segmentation and clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) detection. Materials and Methods: A retrospective study was conducted using Flower FL to train a nnU-Net-based architecture for MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection, using data collected from January 2010 to August 2021. Model development included training and optimizing local epochs, federated rounds, and aggregation strategies for FL-based prostate segmentation on T2-weighted MRIs (four clients, 1294 patients) and csPCa detection using biparametric MRIs (three clients, 1440 patients). Performance was evaluated on independent test sets using the Dice score for segmentation and the Prostate Imaging: Cancer Artificial Intelligence (PI-CAI) score, defined as the average of the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve and average precision, for csPCa detection. P-values for performance differences were calculated using permutation testing. Results: The FL configurations were independently optimized for both tasks, showing improved performance at 1 epoch 300 rounds using FedMedian for prostate segmentation and 5 epochs 200 rounds using FedAdagrad, for csPCa detection. Compared with the average performance of the clients, the optimized FL model significantly improved performance in prostate segmentation and csPCa detection on the independent test set. The optimized FL model showed higher lesion detection performance compared to the FL-baseline model, but no evidence of a difference was observed for prostate segmentation. Conclusions: FL enhanced the performance and generalizability of MRI prostate segmentation and csPCa detection compared with local models, and optimizing its configuration further improved lesion detection performance.

Title: Constrained Stochastic Recursive Momentum Successive Convex Approximation
Authors: Basil M. Idrees, Lavish Arora, Ketan Rajawat
Abstract: We consider stochastic optimization problems with non-convex functional constraints, such as those arising in trajectory generation, sparse approximation, and robust classification. To this end, we put forth a recursive momentum-based accelerated successive convex approximation (SCA) algorithm. At each iteration, the proposed algorithm entails constructing convex surrogates of the stochastic objective and the constraint functions, and solving the resulting convex optimization problem. A recursive update rule is employed to track the gradient of the stochastic objective function, which contributes to variance reduction and hence accelerates the algorithm convergence. A key ingredient of the proof is a new parameterized version of the standard Mangasarian-Fromowitz Constraints Qualification, that allows us to bound the dual variables and hence obtain problem-dependent bounds on the rate at which the iterates approach an $\epsilon$-stationary point. Remarkably, the proposed algorithm achieves near-optimal stochastic first-order (SFO) complexity with adaptive step sizes closely matching that achieved by state-of-the-art stochastic optimization algorithms for solving unconstrained problems. As an example, we detail an obstacle-avoiding trajectory optimization problem that can be solved using the proposed algorithm and show that its performance is superior to that of the existing algorithms used for trajectory optimization. The performance of the proposed algorithm is also shown to be comparable to that of a specialized sparse classification algorithm applied to a binary classification problem.

Title: Accurate Cross-modal Reconstruction of Vehicle Target from Sparse-aspect Multi-baseline SAR data
Authors: Da Li, Guoqiang Zhao, Chen Yao, Kaiqiang Zhu, Houjun Sun, Jiacheng Bao, Maokun Li
Abstract: Multi-aspect multi-baseline SAR 3D imaging is a critical remote sensing technique, promising in urban mapping and monitoring. However, sparse observation due to constrained flight trajectories degrade imaging quality, particularly for anisotropic small targets like vehicles and aircraft. In the past, compressive sensing (CS) was the mainstream approach for sparse 3D SAR reconstruction. More recently, deep learning (DL) has emerged as a powerful alternative, markedly boosting reconstruction quality and efficiency through strong data-driven representations capabilities and fast inference characteristics. However, existing DL methods typically train deep neural networks (DNNs) using only high-resolution radar images. This unimodal learning paradigm precludes the incorporation of complementary information from other data sources, thereby limiting potential improvements in reconstruction performance. In this paper, we introduce cross-modal learning and propose a Cross-Modal 3D-SAR Reconstruction Network (CMAR-Net) that enhances sparse 3D SAR reconstruction by fusing heterogeneous information. Leveraging cross-modal supervision from 2D optical images and error propagation guaranteed by differentiable rendering, CMAR-Net achieves efficient training and reconstructs highly sparse-aspect multi-baseline SAR image into visually structured and accurate 3D images, particularly for vehicle targets. Trained solely on simulated data, CMAR-Net exhibits strong generalization across extensive real-world evaluations on parking lot measurements containing numerous civilian vehicles, outperforming state-of-the-art CS and DL methods in structural accuracy. Our work highlights the potential of cross-modal learning for 3D SAR reconstruction and introduces a novel framework for radar imaging research.

Title: Polynomial time constructive decision algorithm for multivariable quantum signal processing
Authors: Yuki Ito, Hitomi Mori, Kazuki Sakamoto, Keisuke Fujii
Abstract: Quantum signal processing (QSP) and quantum singular value transformation (QSVT) have provided a unified framework for understanding many quantum algorithms, including factorization, matrix inversion, and Hamiltonian simulation. As a multivariable version of QSP, multivariable quantum signal processing (M-QSP) is proposed. M-QSP interleaves signal operators corresponding to each variable with signal processing operators, which provides an efficient means to perform multivariable polynomial transformations. However, the necessary and sufficient condition for what types of polynomials can be constructed by M-QSP is unknown. In this paper, we propose a classical algorithm to determine whether a given pair of multivariable Laurent polynomials can be implemented by M-QSP, which returns True or False. As one of the most important properties of this algorithm, it returning True is the necessary and sufficient condition. The proposed classical algorithm runs in polynomial time in the number of variables and signal operators. Our algorithm also provides a constructive method to select the necessary parameters for implementing M-QSP. These findings offer valuable insights for identifying practical applications of M-QSP.

Title: PATH: A Discrete-sequence Dataset for Evaluating Online Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Approaches for Multivariate Time Series
Authors: Lucas Correia, Jan-Christoph Goos, Thomas Bäck, Anna V. Kononova
Abstract: Benchmarking anomaly detection approaches for multivariate time series is a challenging task due to a lack of high-quality datasets. Current publicly available datasets are too small, not diverse and feature trivial anomalies, which hinders measurable progress in this research area. We propose a solution: a diverse, extensive, and non-trivial dataset generated via state-of-the-art simulation tools that reflects realistic behaviour of an automotive powertrain, including its multivariate, dynamic and variable-state properties. Additionally, our dataset represents a discrete-sequence problem, which remains unaddressed by previously-proposed solutions in literature. To cater for both unsupervised and semi-supervised anomaly detection settings, as well as time series generation and forecasting, we make different versions of the dataset available, where training and test subsets are offered in contaminated and clean versions, depending on the task. We also provide baseline results from a selection of approaches based on deterministic and variational autoencoders, as well as a non-parametric approach. As expected, the baseline experimentation shows that the approaches trained on the semi-supervised version of the dataset outperform their unsupervised counterparts, highlighting a need for approaches more robust to contaminated training data. Furthermore, results show that the threshold used can have a large influence on detection performance, hence more work needs to be invested in methods to find a suitable threshold without the need for labelled data.

Title: FLOAT: Generative Motion Latent Flow Matching for Audio-driven Talking Portrait
Authors: Taekyung Ki, Dongchan Min, Gyeongsu Chae
Abstract: With the rapid advancement of diffusion-based generative models, portrait image animation has achieved remarkable results. However, it still faces challenges in temporally consistent video generation and fast sampling due to its iterative sampling nature. This paper presents FLOAT, an audio-driven talking portrait video generation method based on flow matching generative model. Instead of a pixel-based latent space, we take advantage of a learned orthogonal motion latent space, enabling efficient generation and editing of temporally consistent motion. To achieve this, we introduce a transformer-based vector field predictor with an effective frame-wise conditioning mechanism. Additionally, our method supports speech-driven emotion enhancement, enabling a natural incorporation of expressive motions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method outperforms state-of-the-art audio-driven talking portrait methods in terms of visual quality, motion fidelity, and efficiency.

Title: Data-driven tool wear prediction in milling, based on a process-integrated single-sensor approach
Authors: Eric Hirsch, Christian Friedrich
Abstract: Accurate tool wear prediction is essential for maintaining productivity and minimizing costs in machining. However, the complex nature of the tool wear process poses significant challenges to achieving reliable predictions. This study explores data-driven methods, in particular deep learning, for tool wear prediction. Traditional data-driven approaches often focus on a single process, relying on multi-sensor setups and extensive data generation, which limits generalization to new settings. Moreover, multi-sensor integration is often impractical in industrial environments. To address these limitations, this research investigates the transferability of predictive models using minimal training data, validated across two processes. Furthermore, it uses a simple setup with a single acceleration sensor to establish a low-cost data generation approach that facilitates the generalization of models to other processes via transfer learning. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including transformer-inspired convolutional neural networks (CNN), long short-term memory networks (LSTM), support vector machines (SVM), and decision trees, trained on different input formats such as feature vectors and short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The performance of the models is evaluated on two machines and on different amounts of training data, including scenarios with significantly reduced datasets, providing insight into their effectiveness under constrained data conditions. The results demonstrate the potential of specific models and configurations for effective tool wear prediction, contributing to the development of more adaptable and efficient predictive maintenance strategies in machining. Notably, the ConvNeXt model has an exceptional performance, achieving 99.1\% accuracy in identifying tool wear using data from only four milling tools operated until they are worn.

Title: AudioMiXR: Spatial Audio Object Manipulation with 6DoF for Sound Design in Augmented Reality
Authors: Brandon Woodard, Margarita Geleta, Joseph J. LaViola Jr., Andrea Fanelli, Rhonda Wilson
Abstract: We present AudioMiXR, an augmented reality (AR) interface intended to assess how users manipulate virtual audio objects situated in their physical space using six degrees of freedom (6DoF) deployed on a head-mounted display (Apple Vision Pro) for 3D sound design. Existing tools for 3D sound design are typically constrained to desktop displays, which may limit spatial awareness of mixing within the execution environment. Utilizing an XR HMD to create soundscapes may provide a real-time test environment for 3D sound design, as modern HMDs can provide precise spatial localization assisted by cross-modal interactions. However, there is no research on design guidelines specific to sound design with six degrees of freedom (6DoF) in XR. To provide a first step toward identifying design-related research directions in this space, we conducted an exploratory study where we recruited 27 participants, consisting of expert and non-expert sound designers. The goal was to assess design lessons that can be used to inform future research venues in 3D sound design. We ran a within-subjects study where users designed both a music and cinematic soundscapes. After thematically analyzing participant data, we constructed two design lessons: 1. Proprioception for AR Sound Design, and 2. Balancing Audio-Visual Modalities in AR GUIs. Additionally, we provide application domains that can benefit most from 6DoF sound design based on our results.

Title: Semantic-Aware Adaptive Video Streaming Using Latent Diffusion Models for Wireless Networks
Authors: Zijiang Yan, Jianhua Pei, Hongda Wu, Hina Tabassum, Ping Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel Semantic Communication (SemCom) framework for real-time adaptive-bitrate video streaming by integrating Latent Diffusion Models (LDMs) within the FFmpeg techniques. This solution addresses the challenges of high bandwidth usage, storage inefficiencies, and quality of experience (QoE) degradation associated with traditional Constant Bitrate Streaming (CBS) and Adaptive Bitrate Streaming (ABS). The proposed approach leverages LDMs to compress I-frames into a latent space, offering significant storage and semantic transmission savings without sacrificing high visual quality. While retaining B-frames and P-frames as adjustment metadata to support efficient refinement of video reconstruction at the user side, the proposed framework further incorporates state-of-the-art denoising and Video Frame Interpolation (VFI) techniques. These techniques mitigate semantic ambiguity and restore temporal coherence between frames, even in noisy wireless communication environments. Experimental results demonstrate the proposed method achieves high-quality video streaming with optimized bandwidth usage, outperforming state-of-the-art solutions in terms of QoE and resource efficiency. This work opens new possibilities for scalable real-time video streaming in 5G and future post-5G networks.

Title: System Identification from Partial Observations under Adversarial Attacks
Authors: Jihun Kim, Javad Lavaei
Abstract: This paper is concerned with the partially observed linear system identification, where the goal is to obtain reasonably accurate estimation of the balanced truncation of the true system up to order $k$ from output measurements. We consider the challenging case of system identification under adversarial attacks, where the probability of having an attack at each time is $\Theta(1/k)$ while the value of the attack is arbitrary. We first show that the $\ell_1$-norm estimator exactly identifies the true Markov parameter matrix for nilpotent systems under any type of attack. We then build on this result to extend it to general systems and show that the estimation error exponentially decays as $k$ grows. The estimated balanced truncation model accordingly shows an exponentially decaying error for the identification of the true system up to a similarity transformation. This work is the first to provide the input-output analysis of the system with partial observations under arbitrary attacks.

Title: Simultaneous Motion And Noise Estimation with Event Cameras
Authors: Shintaro Shiba, Yoshimitsu Aoki, Guillermo Gallego
Abstract: Event cameras are emerging vision sensors whose noise is challenging to characterize. Existing denoising methods for event cameras are often designed in isolation and thus consider other tasks, such as motion estimation, separately (i.e., sequentially after denoising). However, motion is an intrinsic part of event data, since scene edges cannot be sensed without motion. We propose, to the best of our knowledge, the first method that simultaneously estimates motion in its various forms (e.g., ego-motion, optical flow) and noise. The method is flexible, as it allows replacing the one-step motion estimation of the widely-used Contrast Maximization framework with any other motion estimator, such as deep neural networks. The experiments show that the proposed method achieves state-of-the-art results on the E-MLB denoising benchmark and competitive results on the DND21 benchmark, while demonstrating effectiveness across motion estimation and intensity reconstruction tasks. Our approach advances event-data denoising theory and expands practical denoising use-cases via open-source code. Project page: this https URL

Title: Conformal changepoint localization
Authors: Sanjit Dandapanthula, Aaditya Ramdas
Abstract: Changepoint localization is the problem of estimating the index at which a change occurred in the data generating distribution of an ordered list of data, or declaring that no change occurred. We present the broadly applicable CONCH (CONformal CHangepoint localization) algorithm, which uses a matrix of conformal p-values to produce a confidence interval for a (single) changepoint under the mild assumption that the pre-change and post-change distributions are each exchangeable. We exemplify the CONCH algorithm on a variety of synthetic and real-world datasets, including using black-box pre-trained classifiers to detect changes in sequences of images, text, and accelerometer data.

Title: SwitchCodec: A High-Fidelity Nerual Audio Codec With Sparse Quantization
Authors: Jin Wang, Wenbin Jiang, Xiangbo Wang, Yubo You, Sheng Fang
Abstract: Neural audio compression has emerged as a promising technology for efficiently representing speech, music, and general audio. However, existing methods suffer from significant performance degradation at limited bitrates, where the available embedding space is sharply constrained. To address this, we propose a universal high-fidelity neural audio compression algorithm featuring Residual Experts Vector Quantization (REVQ), which substantially expands the embedding space with minimal impact on bandwidth. A gentle load-balancing strategy is introduced to ensure the full utilization of this expanded space. Furthermore, we develop a novel multi-tiered discriminator that periodically stratifies STFT spectra, guiding the generator to focus on critical spectral regions. To support multiple bitrates without quality loss at the lower end, we adopt an efficient post-training strategy. Our proposed model achieves impressive performance, with PESQ and ViSQOL scores of 2.87 and 4.27, respectively, at 2.67 kbps bandwidth. The approach effectively reduces spectral blur, decreasing the distance to the original mel-spectrogram by 13%. Notably, our post-training strategy achieves performance comparable to dedicated fixed-bitrate models while reducing the required training time by half. Extensive ablation studies confirm the superiority of our method over baselines.

Title: Improving Code Switching with Supervised Fine Tuning and GELU Adapters
Authors: Linh Pham
Abstract: There are few code switching datasets, labeled or unlabled, that exist today. As a result, ASR requires new methods to utilize the vast monolingual data and models that exist. This paper uses OpenAI's open source ASR model, Whisper, which has been pre-trained on 680K hours of audio to perform monolingual ASR tasks. In Part 1, this paper examines how exploiting Whisper's monolingual ability to individually tokenize training text, called "Switching Tokenizers Method", improves transcription accuracy. In Part 2, we combine the Switching Tokenizers Method from part 1 and train a GELU based adapter on the encoder. These two methods reduced Total Mixed Error Rate (MER) to 9.4% for the ASCEND dataset, 6% for SEAME devman and 9.7% for SEAME devsge, outperforming current SoTA methods.

Title: Next Tokens Denoising for Speech Synthesis
Authors: Yanqing Liu, Ruiqing Xue, Chong Zhang, Yufei Liu, Gang Wang, Bohan Li, Yao Qian, Lei He, Shujie Liu, Sheng Zhao
Abstract: While diffusion and autoregressive (AR) models have significantly advanced generative modeling, they each present distinct limitations. AR models, which rely on causal attention, cannot exploit future context and suffer from slow generation speeds. Conversely, diffusion models struggle with key-value (KV) caching. To overcome these challenges, we introduce Dragon-FM, a novel text-to-speech (TTS) design that unifies AR and flow-matching. This model processes 48 kHz audio codec tokens in chunks at a compact rate of 12.5 tokens per second. This design enables AR modeling across chunks, ensuring global coherence, while parallel flow-matching within chunks facilitates fast iterative denoising. Thus, the model leverages KV-cache across chunks and utilizes bidirectional context within each chunk. Furthermore, it bridges continuous and discrete feature modeling, demonstrating that continuous AR flow-matching can predict discrete tokens with finite scalar quantizers. This efficient codec and fast chunk-autoregressive architecture also make the model highly effective for generating long-form content, such as podcasts. Experiments on podcast datasets demonstrate its capability to efficiently generate high-quality zero-shot podcasts.

Title: Bayesian Optimization of Process Parameters of a Sensor-Based Sorting System using Gaussian Processes as Surrogate Models
Authors: Felix Kronenwett, Georg Maier, Thomas Längle
Abstract: Sensor-based sorting systems enable the physical separation of a material stream into two fractions. The sorting decision is based on the image data evaluation of the sensors used and is carried out using actuators. Various process parameters must be set depending on the properties of the material stream, the dimensioning of the system, and the required sorting accuracy. However, continuous verification and re-adjustment are necessary due to changing requirements and material stream compositions. In this paper, we introduce an approach for optimizing, recurrently monitoring and adjusting the process parameters of a sensor-based sorting system. Based on Bayesian Optimization, Gaussian process regression models are used as surrogate models to achieve specific requirements for system behavior with the uncertainties contained therein. This method minimizes the number of necessary experiments while simultaneously considering two possible optimization targets based on the requirements for both material output streams. In addition, uncertainties are considered during determining sorting accuracies in the model calculation. We evaluated the method with three example process parameters.

Title: Learning to Drift with Individual Wheel Drive: Maneuvering Autonomous Vehicle at the Handling Limits
Authors: Yihan Zhou, Yiwen Lu, Bo Yang, Jiayun Li, Yilin Mo
Abstract: Drifting, characterized by controlled vehicle motion at high sideslip angles, is crucial for safely handling emergency scenarios at the friction limits. While recent reinforcement learning approaches show promise for drifting control, they struggle with the significant simulation-to-reality gap, as policies that perform well in simulation often fail when transferred to physical systems. In this paper, we present a reinforcement learning framework with GPU-accelerated parallel simulation and systematic domain randomization that effectively bridges the gap. The proposed approach is validated on both simulation and a custom-designed and open-sourced 1/10 scale Individual Wheel Drive (IWD) RC car platform featuring independent wheel speed control. Experiments across various scenarios from steady-state circular drifting to direction transitions and variable-curvature path following demonstrate that our approach achieves precise trajectory tracking while maintaining controlled sideslip angles throughout complex maneuvers in both simulated and real-world environments.
