Title: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Content Preserving Perspective: A Review
Authors: Mehran Safayani, Behnaz Mirzapour, Hanieh Aghaebrahimian, Nasrin Salehi, Hamid Ravaee
Abstract: Image-to-image translation (I2I) transforms an image from a source domain to a target domain while preserving source content. Most computer vision applications are in the field of image-to-image translation, such as style transfer, image segmentation, and photo enhancement. The degree of preservation of the content of the source images in the translation process can be different according to the problem and the intended application. From this point of view, in this paper, we divide the different tasks in the field of image-to-image translation into three categories: Fully Content preserving, Partially Content preserving, and Non-Content preserving. We present different tasks, datasets, methods, results of methods for these three categories in this paper. We make a categorization for I2I methods based on the architecture of different models and study each category separately. In addition, we introduce well-known evaluation criteria in the I2I translation field. Specifically, nearly 70 different I2I models were analyzed, and more than 10 quantitative evaluation metrics and 30 distinct tasks and datasets relevant to the I2I translation problem were both introduced and assessed. Translating from simulation to real images could be well viewed as an application of fully content preserving or partially content preserving unsupervised image-to-image translation methods. So, we provide a benchmark for Sim-to-Real translation, which can be used to evaluate different methods. In general, we conclude that because of the different extent of the obligation to preserving content in various applications, it is better to consider this issue in choosing a suitable I2I model for a specific application.

Title: Color Universal Design Neural Network for the Color Vision Deficiencies
Authors: Sunyong Seo, Jinho Park
Abstract: Information regarding images should be visually understood by anyone, including those with color deficiency. However, such information is not recognizable if the color that seems to be distorted to the color deficiencies meets an adjacent object. The aim of this paper is to propose a color universal design network, called CUD-Net, that generates images that are visually understandable by individuals with color deficiency. CUD-Net is a convolutional deep neural network that can preserve color and distinguish colors for input images by regressing the node point of a piecewise linear function and using a specific filter for each image. To generate CUD images for color deficiencies, we follow a four-step process. First, we refine the CUD dataset based on specific criteria by color experts. Second, we expand the input image information through pre-processing that is specialized for color deficiency vision. Third, we employ a multi-modality fusion architecture to combine features and process the expanded images. Finally, we propose a conjugate loss function based on the composition of the predicted image through the model to address one-to-many problems that arise from the dataset. Our approach is able to produce high-quality CUD images that maintain color and contrast stability. The code for CUD-Net is available on the GitHub repository

Title: Improving Lesion Segmentation in Medical Images by Global and Regional Feature Compensation
Authors: Chuhan Wang, Zhenghao Chen, Jean Y. H. Yang, Jinman Kim
Abstract: Automated lesion segmentation of medical images has made tremendous improvements in recent years due to deep learning advancements. However, accurately capturing fine-grained global and regional feature representations remains a challenge. Many existing methods obtain suboptimal performance on complex lesion segmentation due to information loss during typical downsampling operations and the insufficient capture of either regional or global features. To address these issues, we propose the Global and Regional Compensation Segmentation Framework (GRCSF), which introduces two key innovations: the Global Compensation Unit (GCU) and the Region Compensation Unit (RCU). The proposed GCU addresses resolution loss in the U-shaped backbone by preserving global contextual features and fine-grained details during multiscale downsampling. Meanwhile, the RCU introduces a self-supervised learning (SSL) residual map generated by Masked Autoencoders (MAE), obtained as pixel-wise differences between reconstructed and original images, to highlight regions with potential lesions. These SSL residual maps guide precise lesion localization and segmentation through a patch-based cross-attention mechanism that integrates regional spatial and pixel-level features. Additionally, the RCU incorporates patch-level importance scoring to enhance feature fusion by leveraging global spatial information from the backbone. Experiments on two publicly available medical image segmentation datasets, including brain stroke lesion and coronary artery calcification datasets, demonstrate that our GRCSF outperforms state-of-the-art methods, confirming its effectiveness across diverse lesion types and its potential as a generalizable lesion segmentation solution.

Title: ReMAC:Digital Multiple Access Computing by Repeated Transmission
Authors: Xiaojing Yan, Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione
Abstract: In this paper, we consider the ChannelComp framework, where multiple transmitters aim to compute a function of their values at a common receiver while using digital modulations over a multiple access channel. ChannelComp provides a general framework for computation by designing digital constellations for over-the-air computation. Currently, ChannelComp uses a symbol-level encoding. However, encoding repeated transmissions of the same symbol and performing the function computation using the corresponding received sequence may significantly improve the computation performance and reduce the encoding complexity. In this paper, we propose a new scheme where each transmitter repeats the transmission of the same symbol over multiple time slots while encoding such repetitions and designing constellation diagrams to minimize computational errors. We formally model such a scheme by an optimization problem, whose solution jointly identifies the constellation diagram and the repetition code. We call the proposed scheme ReMAC. To manage the computational complexity of the optimization, we divide it into two tractable subproblems. We verify the performance of ReMAC by numerical experiments. The simulation results reveal that ReMAC can reduce the computation error in noisy and fading channels by approximately up to 7.5$dB compared to standard ChannelComp, particularly for product functions.

Title: A Low-Complexity Plug-and-Play Deep Learning Model for Massive MIMO Precoding Across Sites
Authors: Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan, Ahmed Ibrahim, Jean-François Frigon, François Leduc-Primeau
Abstract: Massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) technology has transformed wireless communication by enhancing spectral efficiency and network capacity. This paper proposes a novel deep learning-based mMIMO precoder to tackle the complexity challenges of existing approaches, such as weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE), while leveraging meta-learning domain generalization and a teacher-student architecture to improve generalization across diverse communication environments. When deployed to a previously unseen site, the proposed model achieves excellent sum-rate performance while maintaining low computational complexity by avoiding matrix inversions and by using a simpler neural network structure. The model is trained and tested on a custom ray-tracing dataset composed of several base station locations. The experimental results indicate that our method effectively balances computational efficiency with high sum-rate performance while showcasing strong generalization performance in unseen environments. Furthermore, with fine-tuning, the proposed model outperforms WMMSE across all tested sites and SNR conditions while reducing complexity by at least 73$\times$.

Title: Compression of Site-Specific Deep Neural Networks for Massive MIMO Precoding
Authors: Ghazal Kasalaee, Ali Hasanzadeh Karkan, Jean-François Frigon, François Leduc-Primeau
Abstract: The deployment of deep learning (DL) models for precoding in massive multiple-input multiple-output (mMIMO) systems is often constrained by high computational demands and energy consumption. In this paper, we investigate the compute energy efficiency of mMIMO precoders using DL-based approaches, comparing them to conventional methods such as zero forcing and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE). Our energy consumption model accounts for both memory access and calculation energy within DL accelerators. We propose a framework that incorporates mixed-precision quantization-aware training and neural architecture search to reduce energy usage without compromising accuracy. Using a ray-tracing dataset covering various base station sites, we analyze how site-specific conditions affect the energy efficiency of compressed models. Our results show that deep neural network compression generates precoders with up to 35 times higher energy efficiency than WMMSE at equal performance, depending on the scenario and the desired rate. These results establish a foundation and a benchmark for the development of energy-efficient DL-based mMIMO precoders.

Title: Demand Response Optimization MILP Framework for Microgrids with DERs
Authors: K. Victor Sam Moses Babu, Pratyush Chakraborty, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: The integration of renewable energy sources in microgrids introduces significant operational challenges due to their intermittent nature and the mismatch between generation and demand patterns. Effective demand response (DR) strategies are crucial for maintaining system stability and economic efficiency, particularly in microgrids with high renewable penetration. This paper presents a comprehensive mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) framework for optimizing DR operations in a microgrid with solar generation and battery storage systems. The framework incorporates load classification, dynamic price thresholding, and multi-period coordination for optimal DR event scheduling. Analysis across seven distinct operational scenarios demonstrates consistent peak load reduction of 10\% while achieving energy cost savings ranging from 13.1\% to 38.0\%. The highest performance was observed in scenarios with high solar generation, where the framework achieved 38.0\% energy cost reduction through optimal coordination of renewable resources and DR actions. The results validate the framework's effectiveness in managing diverse operational challenges while maintaining system stability and economic efficiency.

Title: Instantaneous directional channel measurements at 14 GHz and 160 GHz via a virtual circular array
Authors: Wilhelm Keusgen, Taro Eichler
Abstract: In this paper a novel frequency-scalable rotary platform design is introduced which allows for flexible directional channel measurements using different types of antennas, and which can also be used with frequency extenders for measurements up to the THz region. The measurement platform has been applied to measure the channel properties including the direction of arrival at the FR3 frequency 14 GHz and in the D-band at 160 GHz in a large hall indoor environment with LOS distances up to 40 m. The results show very good agreement of strong path components for both frequencies as well as interesting dependencies of delay spread, angular spread, and Ricean K- factor on distance and frequency and can be used to parameterize a path loss model.

Title: A comparative study of different TSO-DSO coordination in the reserve market
Authors: Hang Nguyen, Phuong Nguyen, Koen Kok
Abstract: The increasing penetration of Distributed Energy Resources (DERs) in the distribution system has led to the emergence of a new market actor - the aggregator. The aggregator serves as a facilitator, enabling flexibility asset owners to get access to different markets. In which, EVs aggregators are gaining more attention due to their expanding use and potential to provide services in various types of markets, particularly in the reserve market. Currently, TSO indirectly utilizes these resources under the management of the distribution system operators (DSO), which can negatively impact the distribution grid. Conversely, adjustments from DSOs can impact service provision to TSO due to the shortage of TSO usage information. These factors highlight the importance of evaluating the service provision from aggregators under different TSO-DSO coordination schemes. This paper focuses on the provision of flexibility from electric vehicles (EVs) aggregators for balancing service in the TSO-DSO hybrid-managed and compares it with the DSO-managed coordination schemes. The behavior of aggregators reacting to price fluctuations and TSO requests under different coordination schemes and simulation scenarios is thoroughly evaluated. Additionally, their impact on the grid is analyzed through the DSO's congestion management process and validated using data from a real part of the Dutch distribution network. Results find that the hybrid-managed coordination scheme gives more benefit to the aggregator than the DSO-managed scheme and the EVs aggregator will gain more profit in winter than summer due to more upward regulation service is needed.

Title: A procedure for assessing of machine health index data prediction quality
Authors: Daniel Kuzio, Radosław Zimroz, Agnieszka Wyłomańska
Abstract: The paper discusses the challenge of evaluating the prognosis quality of machine health index (HI) data. Many existing solutions in machine health forecasting involve visually assessing the quality of predictions to roughly gauge the similarity between predicted and actual samples, lacking precise measures or decisions. In this paper, we introduce a universal procedure with multiple variants and criteria. The overarching concept involves comparing predicted data with true HI time series, but each procedure variant has a specific pattern determined through statistical analysis. Additionally, a statistically established threshold is employed to classify the result as either a reliable or non-reliable prognosis. The criteria include both simple measures (MSE, MAPE) and more advanced ones (Space quantiles-inclusion factor, Kupiec's POF, and TUFF statistics). Depending on the criterion chosen, the pattern and decision-making process vary. To illustrate effectiveness, we apply the proposed procedure to HI data sourced from the literature, covering both warning (linear degradation) and critical (exponential degradation) stages. While the method yields a binary output, there is potential for extension to a multi-class classification. Furthermore, experienced users can use the quality measure expressed in percentage for more in-depth analysis.

Title: ASVspoof 5: Design, Collection and Validation of Resources for Spoofing, Deepfake, and Adversarial Attack Detection Using Crowdsourced Speech
Authors: Xin Wang, Héctor Delgado, Hemlata Tak, Jee-weon Jung, Hye-jin Shim, Massimiliano Todisco, Ivan Kukanov, Xuechen Liu, Md Sahidullah, Tomi Kinnunen, Nicholas Evans, Kong Aik Lee, Junichi Yamagishi, Myeonghun Jeong, Ge Zhu, Yongyi Zang, You Zhang, Soumi Maiti, Florian Lux, Nicolas Müller, Wangyou Zhang, Chengzhe Sun, Shuwei Hou, Siwei Lyu, Sébastien Le Maguer, Cheng Gong, Hanjie Guo, Liping Chen, Vishwanath Singh
Abstract: ASVspoof 5 is the fifth edition in a series of challenges which promote the study of speech spoofing and deepfake attacks as well as the design of detection solutions. We introduce the ASVspoof 5 database which is generated in crowdsourced fashion from data collected in diverse acoustic conditions (cf. studio-quality data for earlier ASVspoof databases) and from ~2,000 speakers (cf. ~100 earlier). The database contains attacks generated with 32 different algorithms, also crowdsourced, and optimised to varying degrees using new surrogate detection models. Among them are attacks generated with a mix of legacy and contemporary text-to-speech synthesis and voice conversion models, in addition to adversarial attacks which are incorporated for the first time. ASVspoof 5 protocols comprise seven speaker-disjoint partitions. They include two distinct partitions for the training of different sets of attack models, two more for the development and evaluation of surrogate detection models, and then three additional partitions which comprise the ASVspoof 5 training, development and evaluation sets. An auxiliary set of data collected from an additional 30k speakers can also be used to train speaker encoders for the implementation of attack algorithms. Also described herein is an experimental validation of the new ASVspoof 5 database using a set of automatic speaker verification and spoof/deepfake baseline detectors. With the exception of protocols and tools for the generation of spoofed/deepfake speech, the resources described in this paper, already used by participants of the ASVspoof 5 challenge in 2024, are now all freely available to the community.

Title: Predicting Cognitive Decline: A Multimodal AI Approach to Dementia Screening from Speech
Authors: Lei Chi, Arav Sharma, Ari Gebhardt, Joseph T. Colonel
Abstract: Recent progress has been made in detecting early stage dementia entirely through recordings of patient speech. Multimodal speech analysis methods were applied to the PROCESS challenge, which requires participants to use audio recordings of clinical interviews to predict patients as healthy control, mild cognitive impairment (MCI), or dementia and regress the patient's Mini-Mental State Exam (MMSE) scores. The approach implemented in this work combines acoustic features (eGeMAPS and Prosody) with embeddings from Whisper and RoBERTa models, achieving competitive results in both regression (RMSE: 2.7666) and classification (Macro-F1 score: 0.5774) tasks. Additionally, a novel two-tiered classification setup is utilized to better differentiate between MCI and dementia. Our approach achieved strong results on the test set, ranking seventh on regression and eleventh on classification out of thirty-seven teams, exceeding the baseline results.

Title: Integrated Optimization and Game Theory Framework for Fair Cost Allocation in Community Microgrids
Authors: K. Victor Sam Moses Babu, Pratyush Chakraborty, Mayukha Pal
Abstract: Fair cost allocation in community microgrids remains a significant challenge due to the complex interactions between multiple participants with varying load profiles, distributed energy resources, and storage systems. Traditional cost allocation methods often fail to adequately address the dynamic nature of participant contributions and benefits, leading to inequitable distribution of costs and reduced participant satisfaction. This paper presents a novel framework integrating multi-objective optimization with cooperative game theory for fair and efficient microgrid operation and cost allocation. The proposed approach combines mixed-integer linear programming for optimal resource dispatch with Shapley value analysis for equitable benefit distribution, ensuring both system efficiency and participant satisfaction. The framework was validated using real-world data across six distinct operational scenarios, demonstrating significant improvements in both technical and economic performance. Results show peak demand reductions ranging from 7.8% to 62.6%, solar utilization rates reaching 114.8% through effective storage integration, and cooperative gains of up to $1,801.01 per day. The Shapley value-based allocation achieved balanced benefit-cost distributions, with net positions ranging from -16.0% to +14.2% across different load categories, ensuring sustainable participant cooperation.

Title: Utilizing 3D Fast Spin Echo Anatomical Imaging to Reduce the Number of Contrast Preparations in $T_{1ρ}$ Quantification of Knee Cartilage Using Learning-Based Methods
Authors: Junru Zhong, Chaoxing Huang, Ziqiang Yu, Fan Xiao, Siyue Li, Tim-Yun Michael Ong, Ki-Wai Kevin Ho, Queenie Chan, James F. Griffith, Weitian Chen
Abstract: Purpose: To propose and evaluate an accelerated $T_{1\rho}$ quantification method that combines $T_{1\rho}$-weighted fast spin echo (FSE) images and proton density (PD)-weighted anatomical FSE images, leveraging deep learning models for $T_{1\rho}$ mapping. The goal is to reduce scan time and facilitate integration into routine clinical workflows for osteoarthritis (OA) assessment. Methods: This retrospective study utilized MRI data from 40 participants (30 OA patients and 10 healthy volunteers). A volume of PD-weighted anatomical FSE images and a volume of $T_{1\rho}$-weighted images acquired at a non-zero spin-lock time were used as input to train deep learning models, including a 2D U-Net and a multi-layer perceptron (MLP). $T_{1\rho}$ maps generated by these models were compared with ground truth maps derived from a traditional non-linear least squares (NLLS) fitting method using four $T_{1\rho}$-weighted images. Evaluation metrics included mean absolute error (MAE), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), regional error (RE), and regional percentage error (RPE). Results: Deep learning models achieved RPEs below 5% across all evaluated scenarios, outperforming NLLS methods, especially in low signal-to-noise conditions. The best results were obtained using the 2D U-Net, which effectively leveraged spatial information for accurate $T_{1\rho}$ fitting. The proposed method demonstrated compatibility with shorter TSLs, alleviating RF hardware and specific absorption rate (SAR) limitations. Conclusion: The proposed approach enables efficient $T_{1\rho}$ mapping using PD-weighted anatomical images, reducing scan time while maintaining clinical standards. This method has the potential to facilitate the integration of quantitative MRI techniques into routine clinical practice, benefiting OA diagnosis and monitoring.

Title: Semantic Communication Meets Heterogeneous Network: Emerging Trends, Opportunities, and Challenges
Authors: Guhan Zheng, Qiang Ni, Aryan Kaushik, Lixia Yang
Abstract: Recent developments in machine learning (ML) techniques enable users to extract, transmit, and reproduce information semantics via ML-based semantic communication (SemCom). This significantly increases network spectral efficiency and transmission robustness. In the network, the semantic encoders and decoders among various users, based on ML, however, require collaborative updating according to new transmission tasks. The various heterogeneous characteristics of most networks in turn introduce emerging but unique challenges for semantic codec updating that are different from other general ML model updating. In this article, we first overview the key components of the SemCom system. We then discuss the unique challenges associated with semantic codec updates in heterogeneous networks. Accordingly, we point out a potential framework and discuss the pros and cons thereof. Finally, several future research directions are also discussed.

Title: Joint Transceiver Design for RIS Enhanced Dual-Functional Radar-Communication with Movable Antenna
Authors: Ran Yang, Zheng Dong, Peng Cheng, Yue Xiu, Yan Li, Ning Wei
Abstract: Movable antennas (MAs) have shown significant potential in enhancing the performance of dual-functional radar-communication (DFRC) systems. In this paper, we investigate the MA-based transceiver design for DFRC systems, where a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) is employed to enhance the communication quality in dead zones. To enhance the radar sensing performance, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the radar signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) by jointly optimizing the beamforming vectors, receiving filter, antenna positions, and RIS reflecting coefficients. To tackle this challenging problem, we develop a fractional programming-based optimization framework, incorporating block coordinate descent (BCD), successive convex approximation (SCA), and penalty techniques. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed method can significantly improve the radar SINR and achieve a satisfactory balance between the radar and communication performance compared with existing benchmark schemes.

Title: Multi-user Visible Light Communications with Probabilistic Constellation Shaping and Precoding
Authors: Thang K. Nguyen, Thanh V. Pham, Hoang D. Le, Chuyen T. Nguyen, Anh T. Pham
Abstract: This paper proposes a joint design of probabilistic constellation shaping (PCS) and precoding to enhance the sum-rate performance of multi-user visible light communications (VLC) broadcast channels subject to signal amplitude constraint. In the proposed design, the transmission probabilities of bipolar $M$-pulse amplitude modulation ($M$-PAM) symbols for each user and the transmit precoding matrix are jointly optimized to improve the sum-rate performance. The joint design problem is shown to be a complex multivariate non-convex problem due to the non-convexity of the objective function. To tackle the original non-convex optimization problem, the firefly algorithm (FA), a nature-inspired heuristic optimization approach, is employed to solve a local optima. The FA-based approach, however, suffers from high computational complexity. Thus, using zero-forcing (ZF) precoding, we propose a low-complexity design, which is solved using an alternating optimization approach. Additionally, considering the channel uncertainty, a robust design based on the concept of end-to-end learning with autoencoder (AE) is also presented. Simulation results reveal that the proposed joint design with PCS significantly improves the sum-rate performance compared to the conventional design with uniform signaling. For instance, the joint design achieves $\mathbf{17.5\%}$ and $\mathbf{19.2\%}$ higher sum-rate for 8-PAM and 16-PAM, respectively, at 60 dB peak amplitude-to-noise ratio. Some insights into the optimal symbol distributions of the two joint design approaches are also provided. Furthermore, our results show the advantage of the proposed robust design over the non-robust one under uncertain channel conditions.

Title: A Unifying View of OTFS and Its Many Variants
Authors: Qinwen Deng, Yao Ge, Zhi Ding
Abstract: High mobility environment leads to severe Doppler effects and poses serious challenges to the conventional physical layer based on the widely popular orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The recent emergence of orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) modulation, along with its many related variants, presents a promising solution to overcome such channel Doppler effects. This paper aims to clearly establish the relationships among the various manifestations of OTFS. Among these related modulations, we identify their connections, common features, and distinctions. Building on existing works, this work provides a general overview of various OTFS-related detection schemes and performance comparisons. We first provide an overview of OFDM and filter bank multi-carrier (FBMC) by demonstrating OTFS as a precoded FBMC through the introduction of inverse symplectic finite Fourier transform (ISFFT). We explore the relationship between OTFS and related modulation schemes with similar characteristics. We provide an effective channel model for high-mobility channels and offer a unified detection representation. We provide numerical comparisons of power spectrum density (PSD) and bit error rate (BER) to underscore the benefit of these modulation schemes in high-mobility scenarios. We also evaluate various detection schemes, revealing insights into their efficacies. We discuss opportunities and challenges for OTFS in high mobility, setting the stage for future research and development in this field.

Title: A Stochastic Fundamental Lemma with Reduced Disturbance Data Requirements
Authors: Ruchuan Ou, Guanru Pan, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: Recently, the fundamental lemma by Willems et. al has been extended towards stochastic LTI systems subject to process disturbances. Using this lemma requires previously recorded data of inputs, outputs, and disturbances. In this paper, we exploit causality concepts of stochastic control to propose a variant of the stochastic fundamental lemma that does not require past disturbance data in the Hankel matrices. Our developments rely on polynomial chaos expansions and on the knowledge of the disturbance distribution. Similar to our previous results, the proposed variant of the fundamental lemma allows to predict future input-output trajectories of stochastic LTI systems. We draw upon a numerical example to illustrate the proposed variant in data-driven control context.

Title: Array-Fed RIS: Validation of Friis-Based Modeling Using Full-Wave Simulations
Authors: Krishan Kumar Tiwari, Thomas Flisgen, Wolfgang Heinrich, Giuseppe Caire
Abstract: Space-fed large antenna arrays offer superior efficiency, simplicity, and reductions in size, weight, power, and cost (SWaP-C) compared to constrained-feed systems. Historically, horn antennas have been used for space feeding, but they suffer from limitations such as bulky designs, low aperture efficiency ($\approx 50\%$), and restricted degrees of freedom at the continuous aperture. In contrast, planar patch arrays achieve significantly higher aperture efficiency ($>90\%$) due to their more uniform aperture distribution, reduced weight, and increased degrees of freedom from the discretized aperture. Building on these advantages, we proposed an array-fed Reflective Intelligent Surface (RIS) system, where an active multi-antenna feeder (AMAF) optimizes power transfer by aligning with the principal eigenmode of the AMAF-RIS propagation matrix $\mathbf{T}$. While our previous studies relied on the Friis transmission formula for system modeling, we now validate this approach through full-wave simulations in CST Microwave Studio. By comparing the Friis-based matrix, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm Friis}$, with the full-wave solution, $\mathbf{T}_{\rm this http URL}$, we validate the relevance of the Friis-based modeling for top-level system design. Our findings confirm the feasibility of the proposed AMAF-RIS architecture for next-generation communication systems.

Title: Adaptive Multi-Objective Bayesian Optimization for Capacity Planning of Hybrid Heat Sources in Electric-Heat Coupling Systems of Cold Regions
Authors: Ruizhe Yang, Zhongkai Yi, Ying Xu, Guiyu Chen, Haojie Yang, Rong Yi, Tongqing Li, Miaozhe ShenJin Li, Haoxiang Gao, Hongyu Duan
Abstract: The traditional heat-load generation pattern of combined heat and power generators has become a problem leading to renewable energy source (RES) power curtailment in cold regions, motivating the proposal of a planning model for alternative heat sources. The model aims to identify non-dominant capacity allocation schemes for heat pumps, thermal energy storage, electric boilers, and combined storage heaters to construct a Pareto front, considering both economic and sustainable objectives. The integration of various heat sources from both generation and consumption sides enhances flexibility in utilization. The study introduces a novel optimization algorithm, the adaptive multi-objective Bayesian optimization (AMBO). Compared to other widely used multi-objective optimization algorithms, AMBO eliminates predefined parameters that may introduce subjectivity from planners. Beyond the algorithm, the proposed model incorporates a noise term to account for inevitable simulation deviations, enabling the identification of better-performing planning results that meet the unique requirements of cold regions. What's more, the characteristics of electric-thermal coupling scenarios are captured and reflected in the operation simulation model to make sure the simulation is close to reality. Numerical simulation verifies the superiority of the proposed approach in generating a more diverse and evenly distributed Pareto front in a sample-efficient manner, providing comprehensive and objective planning choices.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for 6G: Prototypes, Experimental Results and Link/System level Simulations
Authors: Sundar Aditya, Yong Jin Daniel Kim, David Vargas, David Redgate, Onur Dizdar, Neil Bhushan, Xinze Lyu, Sibo Zhang, Stephen Wang, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a powerful and versatile physical layer multiple access technique that generalizes and has better interference management capabilities than 5G-based Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). It is also a rapidly maturing technology, all of which makes it a natural successor to SDMA in 6G. In this article, we describe RSMA's suitability for 6G by presenting: i) link and system level simulations of RSMA's performance gains over SDMA in realistic environments, and (ii) pioneering experimental results that demonstrate RSMA's gains over SDMA for key use cases like enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBb), and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We also comment on the status of standardization activities for RSMA.

Title: Joint Attention Mechanism Learning to Facilitate Opto-physiological Monitoring during Physical Activity
Authors: Xiaoyu Zheng, Sijung Hu, Vincent Dwyer, Mahsa Derakhshani, Laura Barrett
Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring is a non-contact technique for measuring cardiac signals, i.e., photoplethysmography (PPG). Quality PPG signals directly lead to reliable physiological readings. However, PPG signal acquisition procedures are often accompanied by spurious motion artefacts (MAs), especially during low-to-high-intensity physical activity. This study proposes a practical adversarial learning approach for opto-physiological monitoring by using a generative adversarial network with an attention mechanism (AM-GAN) to model motion noise and to allow MA removal. The AM-GAN learns an MA-resistant mapping from raw and noisy signals to clear PPG signals in an adversarial manner, guided by an attention mechanism to directly translate the motion reference of triaxial acceleration to the MAs appearing in the raw signal. The AM-GAN was experimented with three various protocols engaged with 39 subjects in various physical activities. The average absolute error for heart rate (HR) derived from the MA-free PPG signal via the AM-GAN, is 1.81 beats/min for the IEEE-SPC dataset and 3.86 beats/min for the PPGDalia dataset. The same procedure applied to an in-house LU dataset resulted in average absolute errors for HR and respiratory rate (RR) of less than 1.37 beats/min and 2.49 breaths/min, respectively. The study demonstrates the robustness and resilience of AM-GAN, particularly during low-to-high-intensity physical activities.

Title: Frequency Domain Stability and Convergence Analysis for General Reset Control Systems Architecture
Authors: S. Ali Hosseini, S. Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: A key factor that generates significant interest in reset control systems, especially within industrial contexts, is their potential to be designed using a frequency-domain loop-shaping procedure. On the other hand, formulating and assessing stability analysis for these nonlinear elements often depends on access to parametric models and numerically solving linear matrix inequalities. These specific factors could present challenges to the successful implementation of reset control within industrial settings. Moreover, one of the most effective structures for implementing reset elements is to use them in parallel with a linear element. Therefore, this article presents the development of the frequency domain-based $H_\beta$ stability method from a series to a more general structure of reset control systems. Additionally, it investigates the behavior of different reset elements in terms of the feasibility of stability in the presence of time delay. To illustrate the research findings, two examples are provided, including one from an industrial application.

Title: Uplink OFDM Channel Prediction with Hybrid CNN-LSTM for 6G Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Bruno De Filippo, Carla Amatetti, Alessandro Vanelli-Coralli
Abstract: Wireless communications are typically subject to complex channel dynamics, requiring the transmission of pilot sequences to estimate and equalize such effects and correctly receive information bits. This is especially true in 6G non-terrestrial networks (NTNs) in low Earth orbit, where one end of the communication link orbits around the Earth at several kilometers per second, and a multi-carrier waveform, such as orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM), is employed. To minimize the pilot overhead, we remove pilot symbols every other OFDM slot and propose a channel predictor to obtain the channel frequency response (CFR) matrix in absence of pilots. The algorithm employs an encoder-decoder convolutional neural network and a long short-term memory layer, along with skip connections, to predict the CFR matrix on the upcoming slot based on the current one. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed predictor through numerical simulations in tapped delay line channel models, highlighting the effective throughput improvement. We further assess the generalization capabilities of the model, showing minimal throughput degradation when testing under different Doppler spreads and in both line of sight (LoS) and non-LoS propagation conditions. Finally, we discuss computational-complexity-related aspects of the lightweight hybrid CNN-LSTM architecture.

Title: ESPARGOS: An Ultra Low-Cost, Realtime-Capable Multi-Antenna WiFi Channel Sounder
Authors: Florian Euchner, Tim Schneider, Marc Gauger, Stephan ten Brink
Abstract: Multi-antenna channel sounding is a technique for measuring the propagation characteristics of electromagnetic waves that is commonly employed for parameterizing channel models. Channel sounders are usually custom-built from many Software Defined Radio receivers, making them expensive to procure and difficult to operate, which constrains the set of users to a few specialized scientific institutions and industrial research laboratories. Recent developments in Joint Communications and Sensing (JCaS) extend the possible uses of channel data to applications like human activity recognition, human presence detection, user localization and wireless Channel Charting, all of which are of great interest to security researchers, experts in industrial automation and others. However, due to a lack of affordable, easy-to-use and commercially available multi-antenna channel sounders, those scientific communities can be hindered by their lack of access to wireless channel measurements. To lower the barrier to entry for channel sounding, we develop an ultra low-cost measurement hardware platform based on mass-produced WiFi chips, which is easily affordable to research groups and even hobbyists.

Title: Coupled Rendezvous and Docking Maneuver control of satellite using Reinforcement learning-based Adaptive Fixed-Time Sliding Mode Controller
Authors: Rakesh Kumar Sahoo, Manoranjan Sinha
Abstract: Satellite dynamics in unknown environments are inherently uncertain due to factors such as varying gravitational fields, atmospheric drag, and unpredictable interactions with space debris or other celestial bodies. Traditional sliding mode controllers with fixed parameters often struggle to maintain optimal performance under these fluctuating conditions. Therefore, an adaptive controller is essential to address these challenges by continuously tuning its gains in real-time. In this paper, we have tuned the slopes of the Fixed-time Sliding surface adaptively using reinforcement learning for coupled rendezvous and docking maneuver of chaser satellite with the target satellite in an unknown space environment. The neural network model is used to determine the optimal gains of reaching law of the fixed-time sliding surface. We have assumed that we don't have an accurate model of the system so we have added noise in the tangent space instead of directly on the manifold to preserve the geometric structure of the system while ensuring mathematically consistent uncertainty propagation. The reinforcement learning is used as an approximator to represent the value function of the agent to estimate the dynamical model of the system using the Actor-Critic method. The proposed control algorithm integrates a neural network and a sliding mode controller in a cascade loop architecture, where the tracking error dynamically tunes the sliding surface gains. Global fixed-time stability of the closed-loop feedback system is proved within the Lyapunov framework. This comprehensive approach of fixed-time sliding mode controller using a Reinforcement Learning based ensures the completion of the mission efficiently while addressing the critical challenges posed by the uncertain environment. The simulation results presented support the claims made.

Title: Exact Leader Estimation: A New Approach for Distributed Differentiation
Authors: Rodrigo Aldana-Lopez, David Gomez-Gutierrez, Elio Usai, Hernan Haimovich
Abstract: A novel strategy aimed at cooperatively differentiating a signal among multiple interacting agents is introduced, where none of the agents needs to know which agent is the leader, i.e. the one producing the signal to be differentiated. Every agent communicates only a scalar variable to its neighbors; except for the leader, all agents execute the same algorithm. The proposed strategy can effectively obtain derivatives up to arbitrary $m$-th order in a finite time under the assumption that the $(m+1)$-th derivative is bounded. The strategy borrows some of its structure from the celebrated homogeneous robust exact differentiator by A. Levant, inheriting its exact differentiation capability and robustness to measurement noise. Hence, the proposed strategy can be said to perform robust exact distributed differentiation. In addition, and for the first time in the distributed leader-observer literature, sampled-data communication and bounded measurement noise are considered, and corresponding steady-state worst-case accuracy bounds are derived. The effectiveness of the proposed strategy is verified numerically for second- and fourth-order systems, i.e., for estimating derivatives of up to first and third order, respectively.

Authors: Huanqing Wang, Kaixiang Zhang, Amin Vahidi-Moghaddam, Haowei An, Nan Li, Daning Huang, Zhaojian Li
Abstract: Spacecraft are vital to space exploration and are often equipped with lightweight, flexible appendages to meet strict weight constraints. These appendages pose significant challenges for modeling and control due to their inherent nonlinearity. Data-driven control methods have gained traction to address such challenges. This paper introduces, to the best of the authors' knowledge, the first application of the data-enabled predictive control (DeePC) framework to boundary control for flexible spacecraft. Leveraging the fundamental lemma, DeePC constructs a non-parametric model by utilizing recorded past trajectories, eliminating the need for explicit model development. The developed method also incorporates dimension reduction techniques to enhance computational efficiency. Through comprehensive numerical simulations, this study compares the proposed method with Lyapunov-based control, demonstrating superior performance and offering a thorough evaluation of data-driven control for flexible spacecraft.

Title: Learned Correction Methods for Ultrasound Computed Tomography Imaging Using Simplified Physics Models
Authors: Luke Lozenski, Hanchen Wang, Fu Li, Mark A. Anastasio, Brendt Wohlberg, Youzuo Lin, Umberto Villa
Abstract: Ultrasound computed tomography (USCT) is an emerging modality for breast imaging. Image reconstruction methods that incorporate accurate wave physics produce high resolution quantitative images of acoustic properties but are computationally expensive. The use of a simplified linear model in reconstruction reduces computational expense at the cost of reduced accuracy. This work aims to systematically compare different learning approaches for USCT reconstruction utilizing simplified linear models. This work considered various learning approaches to compensate for errors stemming from a linearized wave propagation model: correction in the data and image domains. The resulting image reconstruction methods are systematically assessed, alongside data-driven and model-based methods, in four virtual imaging studies utilizing anatomically realistic numerical phantoms. Image quality was assessed utilizing relative root mean square error (RRMSE), structural similarity index measure (SSIM), and a task-based assessment for tumor detection. Correction in the measurement domain resulted in images with minor visual artifacts and highly accurate task performance. Correction in the image domain demonstrated a heavy bias on training data, resulting in hallucinations, but greater robustness to measurement noise. Combining both forms of correction performed best in terms of RRMSE and SSIM, at the cost of task performance. This work systematically assessed learned reconstruction methods incorporating an approximated physical model for USCT imaging. Results demonstrated the importance of incorporating physics, compared to data-driven methods. Learning a correction in the data domain led to better task performance and robust out-of-distribution generalization compared to correction in the image domain.

Title: Enhancing Traffic Safety Analysis with Digital Twin Technology: Integrating Vehicle Dynamics and Environmental Factors into Microscopic Traffic Simulation
Authors: Guanhao Xu, Jianfei Chen, Zejiang Wang, Anye Zhou, Max Schrader, Joshua Bittle, Yunli Shao
Abstract: Traffic safety is a critical concern in transportation engineering and urban planning. Traditional traffic safety analysis requires trained observers to collect data in the field, which is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and sometimes inaccurate. In recent years, microscopic traffic simulation, which simulates individual vehicles' movements within a transportation network, have been utilized to study traffic safety. However, microscopic traffic simulation only focuses on traffic-related factors, such as traffic volume, traffic signals, and lane configurations, neglecting vehicle dynamics and environment-related factors like weather and lighting conditions, which can significantly impact traffic safety. In light of this, this paper explores the application of digital twin technology in traffic safety analysis, integrating vehicle simulators, which consider vehicle dynamics and environmental factors, and microscopic traffic simulators, which simulate the operations of traffic flow, for enhanced safety evaluations. Various scenarios, including different weather conditions and visibility levels, are simulated using a digital twin of a road segment in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. The simulations employ Surrogate Safety Measures (SSMs) like Time to Collision (TTC) and Deceleration Rate to Avoid a Crash (DRAC) to assess safety under varying conditions. The results demonstrate that traffic digital twin can identify potential safety issues that traditional microscopic simulation cannot, providing insights for improving traffic control strategies and transportation infrastructure to enhance traffic safety.

Title: A Data-Driven Method for Microgrid System Identification: Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Mohan Du, Xiaozhe Wang
Abstract: Microgrids (MGs) play a crucial role in utilizing distributed energy resources (DERs) like solar and wind power, enhancing the sustainability and flexibility of modern power systems. However, the inherent variability in MG topology, power flow, and DER operating modes poses significant challenges to the accurate system identification of MGs, which is crucial for designing robust control strategies and ensuring MG stability. This paper proposes a Physically Consistent Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics (PC-SINDy) method for accurate MG system identification. By leveraging an analytically derived library of candidate functions, PC-SINDy extracts accurate dynamic models using only phasor measurement unit (PMU) data. Simulations on a 4-bus system demonstrate that PC-SINDy can reliably and accurately predict frequency trajectories under large disturbances, including scenarios not encountered during the identification/training phase, even when using noisy, low-sampled PMU data.

Title: Towards model based control of the Vertical Gradient Freeze crystal growth process
Authors: Stefan Ecklebe, Frank Woittennek, Jan Winkler, Christiane Frank-Rotsch, Natasha Dropka
Abstract: In this contribution tracking control designs using output feedback are presented for a two-phase Stefan problem arising in the modeling of the Vertical Gradient Freeze process. The two-phase Stefan problem, consisting of two coupled free boundary problems, is a vital part of many crystal growth processes due to the temporally varying extent of the solid and liquid domains during growth. After discussing the special needs of the process, collocated as well as flatness-based state feedback designs are carried out. To render the setup complete, an observer design is performed, using a flatness-based approximation of the original distributed parameter system. The quality of the provided approximations as well as the performance of the open and closed loop control setups is analysed in several simulations.

The proposed method leverages deep learning-based illumination-resilient features and LiDAR-Inertial-Visual Odometry (LIVO). By incorporating advanced techniques such as uniform depth distribution of features enabled by depth association with LiDAR point clouds and adaptive feature matching utilizing Superpoint and LightGlue, LIR-LIVO achieves state-of-the-art (SOTA) accuracy and robustness with low computational cost. Experiments are conducted on benchmark datasets, including NTU-VIRAL, Hilti'22, and R3LIVE-Dataset. The corresponding results demonstrate that our proposed method outperforms other SOTA methods on both standard and challenging datasets. Particularly, the proposed method demonstrates robust pose estimation under poor ambient lighting conditions in the Hilti'22 dataset.

Title: Multispectral Remote Sensing for Weed Detection in West Australian Agricultural Lands
Authors: Haitian Wang, Muhammad Ibrahim, Yumeng Miao, D ustin Severtson, Atif Mansoor, Ajmal S. Mian
Abstract: The Kondinin region in Western Australia faces significant agricultural challenges due to pervasive weed infestations, causing economic losses and ecological impacts. This study constructs a tailored multispectral remote sensing dataset and an end-to-end framework for weed detection to advance precision agriculture practices. Unmanned aerial vehicles were used to collect raw multispectral data from two experimental areas (E2 and E8) over four years, covering 0.6046 km^{2} and ground truth annotations were created with GPS-enabled vehicles to manually label weeds and crops. The dataset is specifically designed for agricultural applications in Western Australia. We propose an end-to-end framework for weed detection that includes extensive preprocessing steps, such as denoising, radiometric calibration, image alignment, orthorectification, and stitching. The proposed method combines vegetation indices (NDVI, GNDVI, EVI, SAVI, MSAVI) with multispectral channels to form classification features, and employs several deep learning models to identify weeds based on the input features. Among these models, ResNet achieves the highest performance, with a weed detection accuracy of 0.9213, an F1-Score of 0.8735, an mIOU of 0.7888, and an mDC of 0.8865, validating the efficacy of the dataset and the proposed weed detection method.

Title: Policy Selection and Schedules for Exclusive Bus Lane and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane in a Bi-modal Transportation Corridor
Authors: Jiaqing Lu, Qianwen Guo, Paul Schonfeld
Abstract: Efficient management of transportation corridors is critical for sustaining urban mobility, directly influencing transportation efficiency. Two prominent strategies for enhancing public transit services and alleviating congestion, Exclusive Bus Lane (EBL) and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane (HOVL), are gaining increasing attention. EBLs prioritize bus transit by providing dedicated lanes for faster travel times, while HOVLs encourage carpooling by reserving lanes for high-occupancy vehicles. However, static implementations of these policies may underutilize road resources and disrupt general-purpose lanes. Dynamic control of these policies, based on real-time demand, can potentially maximize road efficiency and minimize negative impacts. This study develops cost functions for Mixed Traffic Policy (MTP), Exclusive Bus Lane Policy (EBLP), and High Occupancy Vehicle Lane Policy (HOVLP), incorporating optimized bus frequency and demand split under equilibrium condition. Switching thresholds for policy selection are derived to identify optimal periods for implementing each policy based on dynamic demand simulated using an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (O-U) process. Results reveal significant reductions in total system costs with the proposed dynamic policy integration. Compared to static implementations, the combined policy achieves cost reductions of 12.0%, 5.3% and 42.5% relative to MTP-only, EBLP-only, and HOVLP-only scenarios, respectively. Additionally, in two real case studies of existing EBL and HOVL operations, the proposed dynamic policy reduces total costs by 32.2% and 27.9%, respectively. The findings provide valuable insights for policymakers and transit planners, offering a robust framework for dynamically scheduling and integrating EBL and HOVL policies to optimize urban corridor efficiency and reduce overall system costs.

Title: Equity-aware Design and Timing of Fare-free Transit Zoning under Demand Uncertainty
Authors: Qianwen Guo, Jiaqing Lu, Joseph Y. J. Chow, Paul Schonfeld
Abstract: We propose the first analytical stochastic model for optimizing the configuration and implementation policies of fare-free transit. The model focuses on a transportation corridor with two transportation modes: automobiles and buses. The corridor is divided into two sections, an inner one with fare-free transit service and an outer one with fare-based transit service. Under the static version of the model, the optimized length and frequency of the fare-free transit zone can be determined by maximizing total social welfare. The findings indicate that implementing fare-free transit can increase transit ridership and reduce automobile use within the fare-free zone while social equity among the demand groups can be enhanced by lengthening the fare-free zone. Notably, the optimal zone length increases when both social welfare and equity are considered jointly, compared to only prioritizing social welfare. The dynamic model, framed within a market entry and exit real options approach, solves the fare policy switching problem, establishing optimal timing policies for activating or terminating fare-free service. The results from dynamic models reveal earlier implementation and extended durations of fare-free transit in the social welfare-aware regime, driven by lower thresholds compared to the social equity-aware regime.

Title: Are Expressions for Music Emotions the Same Across Cultures?
Authors: Elif Celen, Pol van Rijn, Harin Lee, Nori Jacoby
Abstract: Music evokes profound emotions, yet the universality of emotional descriptors across languages remains debated. A key challenge in cross-cultural research on music emotion is biased stimulus selection and manual curation of taxonomies, predominantly relying on Western music and languages. To address this, we propose a balanced experimental design with nine online experiments in Brazil, the US, and South Korea, involving N=672 participants. First, we sample a balanced set of popular music from these countries. Using an open-ended tagging pipeline, we then gather emotion terms to create culture-specific taxonomies. Finally, using these bottom-up taxonomies, participants rate emotions of each song. This allows us to map emotional similarities within and across cultures. Results show consistency in high arousal, high valence emotions but greater variability in others. Notably, machine translations were often inadequate to capture music-specific meanings. These findings together highlight the need for a domain-sensitive, open-ended, bottom-up emotion elicitation approach to reduce cultural biases in emotion research.

Title: Delay Analysis of 5G HARQ in the Presence of Decoding and Feedback Latencies
Authors: Vishnu N Moothedath, Sangwon Seo, Neda Petreska, Bernhard Kloiber, James Gross
Abstract: The growing demand for stringent quality of service (QoS) guarantees in 5G networks requires accurate characterisation of delay performance, often measured using Delay Violation Probability (DVP) for a given target delay. Widely used retransmission schemes like Automatic Repeat reQuest (ARQ) and Hybrid ARQ (HARQ) improve QoS through effective feedback, incremental redundancy (IR), and parallel retransmission processes. However, existing works to quantify the DVP under these retransmission schemes overlook practical aspects such as decoding complexity, feedback delays, and the resulting need for multiple parallel ARQ/HARQ processes that enable packet transmissions without waiting for previous feedback, thus exploiting valuable transmission opportunities. This work proposes a comprehensive multi-server delay model for ARQ/HARQ that incorporates these aspects. Using a finite blocklength error model, we derive closed-form expressions and algorithms for accurate DVP evaluation under realistic 5G configurations aligned with 3GPP standards. Our numerical evaluations demonstrate notable improvements in DVP accuracy over the state-of-the-art, highlight the impact of parameter tuning and resource allocation, and reveal how DVP affects system throughput.

Title: A Bundle-based Augmented Lagrangian Framework: Algorithm, Convergence, and Primal-dual Principles
Authors: Feng-Yi Liao, Yang Zheng
Abstract: We propose a new bundle-based augmented Lagrangian framework for solving constrained convex problems. Unlike the classical (inexact) augmented Lagrangian method (ALM) that has a nested double-loop structure, our framework features a $\textit{single-loop}$ process. Motivated by the proximal bundle method (PBM), we use a $\textit{bundle}$ of past iterates to approximate the subproblem in ALM to get a computationally efficient update at each iteration. We establish sub-linear convergences for primal feasibility, primal cost values, and dual iterates under mild assumptions. With further regularity conditions, such as quadratic growth, our algorithm enjoys $\textit{linear}$ convergences. Importantly, this linear convergence can happen for a class of conic optimization problems, including semidefinite programs. Our proof techniques leverage deep connections with inexact ALM and primal-dual principles with PBM.

Title: Data Sensor Fusion In Digital Twin Technology For Enhanced Capabilities In A Home Environment
Authors: Benjamin Momoh, Salisu Yahaya
Abstract: This paper investigates the integration of data sensor fusion in digital twin technology to bolster home environment capabilities, particularly in the context of challenges brought on by the coronavirus pandemic and its economic effects. The study underscores the crucial role of digital transformation in not just adapting to, but also mitigating disruptions during the fourth industrial revolution. Using the Wit Motion sensor, data was collected for activities such as walking, working, sitting, and lying, with sensors measuring accelerometers, gyroscopes, and magnetometers. The research integrates Cyber-physical systems, IoT, AI, and robotics to fortify digital twin capabilities. The paper compares sensor fusion methods, including feature-level fusion, decision-level fusion, and Kalman filter fusion, alongside machine learning models like SVM, GBoost, and Random Forest to assess model effectiveness. Results show that sensor fusion significantly improves the accuracy and reliability of these models, as it compensates for individual sensor weaknesses, particularly with magnetometers. Despite higher accuracy in ideal conditions, integrating data from multiple sensors ensures more consistent and reliable results in real-world settings, thereby establishing a robust system that can be confidently applied in practical scenarios.

Title: Quantum code division multiple access based continuous-variable quantum key distribution
Authors: Shahnoor Ali, Neel Kanth Kundu
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a quantum code division multiple access (q-CDMA) based continuous-variable quantum key distribution (CV-QKD) system. In the proposed system, the quantum states of two senders ($\text{Alice}_{1,2}$) are chaotically encoded through chaotic phase shifters and then transmitted over a quantum channel. At the receiver, the quantum states are decoded via chaos synchronization to separate the quantum states sent by the different senders and received by the two receivers ($\text{Bob}_{1,2}$) separately. We characterize the input-output relation of the quadrature between the two senders and receivers and then analyze the secret key rate (SKR) of the q-CDMA-based CV-QKD system. Our numerical results reveal that the q-CDMA approach can significantly enhance the SKR for both users when compared to the single-user case without the q-CDMA approach.

Title: Dynamic Rolling Horizon Optimization for Network-Constrained V2X Value Stacking of Electric Vehicles Under Uncertainties
Authors: Canchen Jiang, Ariel Liebman, Bo Jie, Hao Wang
Abstract: Electric vehicle (EV) coordination can provide significant benefits through vehicle-to-everything (V2X) by interacting with the grid, buildings, and other EVs. This work aims to develop a V2X value-stacking framework, including vehicle-to-building (V2B), vehicle-to-grid (V2G), and energy trading, to maximize economic benefits for residential communities while maintaining distribution voltage. This work also seeks to quantify the impact of prediction errors related to building load, renewable energy, and EV arrivals. A dynamic rolling-horizon optimization (RHO) method is employed to leverage multiple revenue streams and maximize the potential of EV coordination. To address energy uncertainties, including hourly local building load, local photovoltaic (PV) generation, and EV arrivals, this work develops a Transformer-based forecasting model named Gated Recurrent Units-Encoder-Temporal Fusion Decoder (GRU-EN-TFD). The simulation results, using real data from Australia's National Electricity Market, and the Independent System Operators in New England and New York in the US, reveal that V2X value stacking can significantly reduce energy costs. The proposed GRU-EN-TFD model outperforms the benchmark forecast model. Uncertainties in EV arrivals have a more substantial impact on value-stacking performance, highlighting the significance of its accurate forecast. This work provides new insights into the dynamic interactions among residential communities, unlocking the full potential of EV batteries.

Title: Global Stabilization of Chemostats with Nonzero Mortality and Substrate Dynamics
Authors: Iasson Karafyllis, Epiphane Loko, Miroslav Krstic, Antoine Chaillet
Abstract: In "chemostat"-type population models that incorporate substrate (nutrient) dynamics, the dependence of the birth (or growth) rate on the substrate concentration introduces nonlinear coupling that creates a challenge for stabilization that is global, namely, for all positive concentrations of the biomass and nutrients. This challenge for global stabilization has been overcome in the literature using relatively simple feedback when natural mortality of the biomass is absent. However, under natural mortality, it takes fortified, more complex feedback, outside of the existing nonlinear control design toolbox, to avoid biomass extinction from nutrient-depleted initial conditions. Such fortified feedback, the associated control Laypunov function design, and Lyapunov analysis of global stability are provided in this paper. We achieve global stabilization for two different chemostat models: (i) a lumped model, with two state variables, and (ii) a three-state model derived from an age-structured infinite-dimensional model. The proposed feedback stabilizers are explicit, applicable to both the lumped and the age-structured models, and coincide with simple feedback laws proposed in the literature when the mortality rate is zero. Global stabilization means subject to constraints: all positive biomass and nutrient concentrations are within the region of attraction of the desired equilibrium, and, additionally, this is achieved with a dilution input that is guaranteed to remain positive. For the lumped case with Haldane kinetics, we show that the reproduction rate dominating the mortality (excluding the reproduction and mortality being in balance) is not only sufficient but also necessary for global stabilization. The obtained results are illustrated with simple examples.

Title: Learning to Predict Global Atrial Fibrillation Dynamics from Sparse Measurements
Authors: Alexander Jenkins, Andrea Cini, Joseph Barker, Alexander Sharp, Arunashis Sau, Varun Valentine, Srushti Valasang, Xinyang Li, Tom Wong, Timothy Betts, Danilo Mandic, Cesare Alippi, Fu Siong Ng
Abstract: Catheter ablation of Atrial Fibrillation (AF) consists of a one-size-fits-all treatment with limited success in persistent AF. This may be due to our inability to map the dynamics of AF with the limited resolution and coverage provided by sequential contact mapping catheters, preventing effective patient phenotyping for personalised, targeted ablation. Here we introduce FibMap, a graph recurrent neural network model that reconstructs global AF dynamics from sparse measurements. Trained and validated on 51 non-contact whole atria recordings, FibMap reconstructs whole atria dynamics from 10% surface coverage, achieving a 210% lower mean absolute error and an order of magnitude higher performance in tracking phase singularities compared to baseline methods. Clinical utility of FibMap is demonstrated on real-world contact mapping recordings, achieving reconstruction fidelity comparable to non-contact mapping. FibMap's state-spaces and patient-specific parameters offer insights for electrophenotyping AF. Integrating FibMap into clinical practice could enable personalised AF care and improve outcomes.

Title: Inverse Design with Dynamic Mode Decomposition
Authors: Yunpeng Zhu, Liangliang Cheng, Anping Jing, Hanyu Huo, Ziqiang Lang, Bo Zhang, J. Nathan Kutz
Abstract: We introduce a computationally efficient method for the automation of inverse design in science and engineering. Based on simple least-square regression, the underlying dynamic mode decomposition algorithm can be used to construct a low-rank subspace spanning multiple experiments in parameter space. The proposed inverse design dynamic mode composition (ID-DMD) algorithm leverages the computed low-dimensional subspace to enable fast digital design and optimization on laptop-level computing, including the potential to prescribe the dynamics themselves. Moreover, the method is robust to noise, physically interpretable, and can provide uncertainty quantification metrics. The architecture can also efficiently scale to large-scale design problems using randomized algorithms in the ID-DMD. The simplicity of the method and its implementation are highly attractive in practice, and the ID-DMD has been demonstrated to be an order of magnitude more accurate than competing methods while simultaneously being 3-5 orders faster on challenging engineering design problems ranging from structural vibrations to fluid dynamics. Due to its speed, robustness, interpretability, and ease-of-use, ID-DMD in comparison with other leading machine learning methods represents a significant advancement in data-driven methods for inverse design and optimization, promising a paradigm shift in how to approach inverse design in practice.

SQ-GAN employs off-the-shelf semantic semantic segmentation and a new specifically developed semantic-conditioned adaptive mask module (SAMM) to selectively encode semantically significant features of the images. SQ-GAN outperforms state-of-the-art image compression schemes such as JPEG2000 and BPG across multiple metrics, including perceptual quality and semantic segmentation accuracy on the post-decoding reconstructed image, at extreme low compression rates expressed in bits per pixel.

Title: Real-Time Fast Marching Tree for Mobile Robot Motion Planning in Dynamic Environments
Authors: Jefferson Silveira, Kleber Cabral, Sidney Givigi, Joshua A. Marshall
Abstract: This paper proposes the Real-Time Fast Marching Tree (RT-FMT), a real-time planning algorithm that features local and global path generation, multiple-query planning, and dynamic obstacle avoidance. During the search, RT-FMT quickly looks for the global solution and, in the meantime, generates local paths that can be used by the robot to start execution faster. In addition, our algorithm constantly rewires the tree to keep branches from forming inside the dynamic obstacles and to maintain the tree root near the robot, which allows the tree to be reused multiple times for different goals. Our algorithm is based on the planners Fast Marching Tree (FMT*) and Real-time Rapidly-Exploring Random Tree (RT-RRT*). We show via simulations that RT-FMT outperforms RT- RRT* in both execution cost and arrival time, in most cases. Moreover, we also demonstrate via simulation that it is worthwhile taking the local path before the global path is available in order to reduce arrival time, even though there is a small possibility of taking an inferior path.

Title: LEO Satellite and RIS: Two Keys to Seamless Indoor and Outdoor Localization
Authors: Pinjun Zheng, Xing Liu, Yuchen Zhang, Jiguang He, Gonzalo Seco-Granados, Tareq Y. Al-Naffouri
Abstract: The contemporary landscape of wireless technology underscores the critical role of precise localization services. Traditional global navigation satellite systems (GNSS)-based solutions, however, fall short when it comes to indoor environments, and existing indoor localization techniques such as electromagnetic fingerprinting methods face challenges of additional implementation costs and limited coverage. This article explores an innovative solution that blends low Earth orbit (LEO) satellites with reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs), unlocking its potential for realizing seamless indoor and outdoor localization (SIOL) with global coverage. After a comprehensive review of the distinctive characteristics of LEO satellites and RISs, we showcase their potential for SIOL applications through two case studies on position error bound evaluation. Finally, we discuss system architectures and highlight open challenges in such systems.

Title: A Lightweight Energy Management Method for Hybrid PV/Battery/Load Systems
Authors: Mohsen Banaei, Razgar Ebrahimy, Henrik Madsen
Abstract: In this paper, a computationally lightweight algorithm is introduced for hybrid PV/Battery/Load systems that is price responsive, responds fast, does not require powerful hardware, and considers the operational limitations of the system. The method is applied to two buildings equipped with PV and battery. Simulation results show that the method can give results that are up to 3.9% more expensive than the Model predictive control (MPC) approach while the runtime of the program is up to 1000 times less than the MPC. Also, while the runtime of the proposed method is in the range of the self-consumption maximization (SCM) approach as the fastest method, its electricity cost is about 3.2% cheaper than the SCM method. Simulation results also show that in case of providing grid services by the battery the difference between electricity cost of the proposed approach and MPC can reduce which makes the method good for such applications.

Title: Dionysos.jl: a Modular Platform for Smart Symbolic Control
Authors: Julien Calbert, Adrien Banse, Benoît Legat, Raphaël M. Jungers
Abstract: We introduce this http URL, a modular package for solving optimal control problems for complex dynamical systems using state-of-the-art and experimental techniques from symbolic control, optimization, and learning. More often than not with Cyber-Physical systems, the only sensible way of developing a controller is by discretizing the different variables, thus transforming the control task into a purely combinatorial problem on a finite-state mathematical object, called an abstraction of this system. Although this approach offers a safety-critical framework, the available techniques suffer important scalability issues. In order to render these techniques practical, it is necessary to construct smarter abstractions that differ from classical techniques by partitioning the state-space in a non trivial way.

Title: Data-driven Modeling of Combined Sewer Systems for Urban Sustainability: An Empirical Evaluation
Authors: Vipin Singh, Tianheng Ling, Teodor Chiaburu, Felix Biessmann
Abstract: Climate change poses complex challenges, with extreme weather events becoming increasingly frequent and difficult to model. Examples include the dynamics of Combined Sewer Systems (CSS). Overburdened CSS during heavy rainfall will overflow untreated wastewater into surface water bodies. Classical approaches to modeling the impact of extreme rainfall events rely on physical simulations, which are particularly challenging to create for large urban infrastructures. Deep Learning (DL) models offer a cost-effective alternative for modeling the complex dynamics of sewer systems. In this study, we present a comprehensive empirical evaluation of several state-of-the-art DL time series models for predicting sewer system dynamics in a large urban infrastructure, utilizing three years of measurement data. We especially investigate the potential of DL models to maintain predictive precision during network outages by comparing global models, which have access to all variables within the sewer system, and local models, which are limited to data from a restricted set of local sensors. Our findings demonstrate that DL models can accurately predict the dynamics of sewer system load, even under network outage conditions. These results suggest that DL models can effectively aid in balancing the load redistribution in CSS, thereby enhancing the sustainability and resilience of urban infrastructures.

Title: A novel and efficient parameter estimation of the Lognormal-Rician turbulence model based on k-Nearest Neighbor and data generation method
Authors: Maoke Miao, Xinyu Zhang, Bo Liu, Rui Yin, Jiantao Yuan, Feng Gao, Xiao-Yu Chen
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel and efficient parameter estimator based on $k$-Nearest Neighbor ($k$NN) and data generation method for the Lognormal-Rician turbulence channel. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) goodness-of-fit statistical tools are employed to investigate the validity of $k$NN approximation under different channel conditions and it is shown that the choice of $k$ plays a significant role in the approximation accuracy. We present several numerical results to illustrate that solving the constructed objective function can provide a reasonable estimate for the actual values. The accuracy of the proposed estimator is investigated in terms of the mean square error. The simulation results show that increasing the number of generation samples by two orders of magnitude does not lead to a significant improvement in estimation performance when solving the optimization problem by the gradient descent algorithm. However, the estimation performance under the genetic algorithm (GA) approximates to that of the saddlepoint approximation and expectation-maximization estimators. Therefore, combined with the GA, we demonstrate that the proposed estimator achieves the best tradeoff between the computation complexity and the accuracy.

Title: MT2KD: Towards A General-Purpose Encoder for Speech, Speaker, and Audio Events
Authors: Xiaoyu Yang, Qiujia Li, Chao Zhang, Phil Woodland
Abstract: With the advances in deep learning, the performance of end-to-end (E2E) single-task models for speech and audio processing has been constantly improving. However, it is still challenging to build a general-purpose model with high performance on multiple tasks, since different speech and audio processing tasks usually require different training data, input features, or model architectures to achieve optimal performance. In this work, MT2KD, a novel two-stage multi-task learning framework is proposed to build a general-purpose speech and audio encoder that jointly performs three fundamental tasks: automatic speech recognition (ASR), audio tagging (AT) and speaker verification (SV). In the first stage, multi-teacher knowledge distillation (KD) is applied to align the feature spaces of three single-task high-performance teacher encoders into a single student encoder using the same unlabelled data. In the second stage, multi-task supervised fine-tuning is carried out by initialising the model from the first stage and training on the separate labelled data of each single task. Experiments demonstrate that the proposed multi-task training pipeline significantly outperforms a baseline model trained with multi-task learning from scratch. The final system achieves good performance on ASR, AT and SV: with less than 4% relative word-error-rate increase on ASR, only 1.9 lower mean averaged precision on AT and 0.23% absolute higher equal error rate on SV compared to the best-performing single-task encoders, using only a 66M total model parameters.

Title: Fully Unsupervised Dynamic MRI Reconstruction via Diffeo-Temporal Equivariance
Authors: Andrew Wang, Mike Davies
Abstract: Reconstructing dynamic MRI image sequences from undersampled accelerated measurements is crucial for faster and higher spatiotemporal resolution real-time imaging of cardiac motion, free breathing motion and many other applications. Classical paradigms, such as gated cine MRI, assume periodicity, disallowing imaging of true motion. Supervised deep learning methods are fundamentally flawed as, in dynamic imaging, ground truth fully-sampled videos are impossible to truly obtain. We propose an unsupervised framework to learn to reconstruct dynamic MRI sequences from undersampled measurements alone by leveraging natural geometric spatiotemporal equivariances of MRI. Dynamic Diffeomorphic Equivariant Imaging (DDEI) significantly outperforms state-of-the-art unsupervised methods such as SSDU on highly accelerated dynamic cardiac imaging. Our method is agnostic to the underlying neural network architecture and can be used to adapt the latest models and post-processing approaches. Our code and video demos are at this https URL.

Title: A Unified Model for Compressed Sensing MRI Across Undersampling Patterns
Authors: Armeet Singh Jatyani, Jiayun Wang, Aditi Chandrashekar, Zihui Wu, Miguel Liu-Schiaffini, Bahareh Tolooshams, Anima Anandkumar
Abstract: Compressed Sensing MRI reconstructs images of the body's internal anatomy from undersampled measurements, thereby reducing the scan time - the time subjects need to remain still. Recently, deep neural networks have shown great potential for reconstructing high-fidelity images from highly undersampled measurements in the frequency space. However, one needs to train multiple models for different undersampling patterns and desired output image resolutions, since most networks operate on a fixed discretization. Such approaches are highly impractical in clinical settings, where undersampling patterns and image resolutions are frequently changed to accommodate different real-time imaging and diagnostic requirements. We propose a unified model robust to different measurement undersampling patterns and image resolutions in compressed sensing MRI. Our model is based on neural operators, a discretization-agnostic architecture. Neural operators are employed in both image and measurement space, which capture local and global image features for MRI reconstruction. Empirically, we achieve consistent performance across different undersampling rates and patterns, with an average 11 percent SSIM and 4dB PSNR improvement over a state-of-the-art CNN, End-to-End VarNet. For efficiency, our inference speed is also 1,400x faster than diffusion methods. The resolution-agnostic design also enhances zero-shot super-resolution and extended field of view in reconstructed images. Our unified model offers a versatile solution for MRI, adapting seamlessly to various measurement undersampling and imaging resolutions, making it highly effective for flexible and reliable clinical imaging.

Title: AI Flow at the Network Edge
Authors: Jiawei Shao, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Recent advancements in large language models (LLMs) and their multimodal variants have led to remarkable progress across various domains, demonstrating impressive capabilities and unprecedented potential. In the era of ubiquitous connectivity, leveraging communication networks to distribute intelligence is a transformative concept, envisioning AI-powered services accessible at the network edge. However, pushing large models from the cloud to resource-constrained environments faces critical challenges. Model inference on low-end devices leads to excessive latency and performance bottlenecks, while raw data transmission over limited bandwidth networks causes high communication overhead. This article presents AI Flow, a framework that streamlines the inference process by jointly leveraging the heterogeneous resources available across devices, edge nodes, and cloud servers, making intelligence flow across networks. To facilitate cooperation among multiple computational nodes, the proposed framework explores a paradigm shift in the design of communication network systems from transmitting information flow to intelligence flow, where the goal of communications is task-oriented and folded into the inference process. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed framework through an image captioning use case, showcasing the ability to reduce response latency while maintaining high-quality captions. This article serves as a position paper for identifying the motivation, challenges, and principles of AI Flow.

Title: Resonant Beam Multi-Target DOA Estimation
Authors: Yixuan Guo, Qingwei Jiang, Mingliang Xiong, Wen Fang, Mingqing Liu, Qingqing Zhang, Qingwen Liu, Gang Yan
Abstract: With the increasing demand for internet of things (IoT) applications, especially for location-based services, how to locate passive mobile targets (MTs) with minimal beam control has become a challenge. Resonant beam systems are considered promising IoT technologies with advantages such as beam self-alignment and energy concentration. To establish a resonant system in the radio frequency (RF) band and achieve multi-target localization, this paper designs a multi-target resonant system architecture, allowing a single base station (BS) to independently connect with multiple MTs. By employing a retro-directive array, a multi-channel cyclic model is established to realize one-to-many electromagnetic wave propagation and MT direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation through echo resonance. Simulation results show that the proposed system supports resonant establishment between the BS and multiple MTs. This helps the BS to still have high DOA estimation accuracy in the face of multiple passive MTs, and can ensure that the DOA error is less than 1 degree within a range of 6 meters at a 50degree field of view, with higher accuracy than active beamforming localization systems.

Title: DM-Mamba: Dual-domain Multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction
Authors: Yucong Meng, Zhiwei Yang, Zhijian Song, Yonghong Shi
Abstract: The accelerated MRI reconstruction poses a challenging ill-posed inverse problem due to the significant undersampling in k-space. Deep neural networks, such as CNNs and ViT, have shown substantial performance improvements for this task while encountering the dilemma between global receptive fields and efficient computation. To this end, this paper pioneers exploring Mamba, a new paradigm for long-range dependency modeling with linear complexity, for efficient and effective MRI reconstruction. However, directly applying Mamba to MRI reconstruction faces three significant issues: (1) Mamba's row-wise and column-wise scanning disrupts k-space's unique spectrum, leaving its potential in k-space learning unexplored. (2) Existing Mamba methods unfold feature maps with multiple lengthy scanning paths, leading to long-range forgetting and high computational burden. (3) Mamba struggles with spatially-varying contents, resulting in limited diversity of local representations. To address these, we propose a dual-domain multi-scale Mamba for MRI reconstruction from the following perspectives: (1) We pioneer vision Mamba in k-space learning. A circular scanning is customized for spectrum unfolding, benefiting the global modeling of k-space. (2) We propose a multi-scale Mamba with an efficient scanning strategy in both image and k-space domains. It mitigates long-range forgetting and achieves a better trade-off between efficiency and performance. (3) We develop a local diversity enhancement module to improve the spatially-varying representation of Mamba. Extensive experiments are conducted on three public datasets for MRI reconstruction under various undersampling patterns. Comprehensive results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods with lower computational cost. Implementation code will be available at this https URL.

Title: Post-Training Quantization for Vision Mamba with k-Scaled Quantization and Reparameterization
Authors: Bo-Yun Shi, Yi-Cheng Lo, An-Yeu (Andy)Wu, Yi-Min Tsai
Abstract: The Mamba model, utilizing a structured state-space model (SSM), offers linear time complexity and demonstrates significant potential. Vision Mamba (ViM) extends this framework to vision tasks by incorporating a bidirectional SSM and patch embedding, surpassing Transformer-based models in performance. While model quantization is essential for efficient computing, existing works have focused solely on the original Mamba model and have not been applied to ViM. Additionally, they neglect quantizing the SSM layer, which is central to Mamba and can lead to substantial error propagation by naive quantization due to its inherent structure. In this paper, we focus on the post-training quantization (PTQ) of ViM. We address the issues with three core techniques: 1) a k-scaled token-wise quantization method for linear and convolutional layers, 2) a reparameterization technique to simplify hidden state quantization, and 3) a factor-determining method that reduces computational overhead by integrating operations. Through these methods, the error caused by PTQ can be mitigated. Experimental results on ImageNet-1k demonstrate only a 0.8-1.2\% accuracy degradation due to PTQ, highlighting the effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Integration of Prior Knowledge into Direct Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Amir Modares, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.

Title: Less is More for Synthetic Speech Detection in the Wild
Authors: Ashi Garg, Zexin Cai, Henry Li Xinyuan, Leibny Paola García-Perera, Kevin Duh, Sanjeev Khudanpur, Matthew Wiesner, Nicholas Andrews
Abstract: Driven by advances in self-supervised learning for speech, state-of-the-art synthetic speech detectors have achieved low error rates on popular benchmarks such as ASVspoof. However, prior benchmarks do not address the wide range of real-world variability in speech. Are reported error rates realistic in real-world conditions? To assess detector failure modes and robustness under controlled distribution shifts, we introduce ShiftySpeech, a benchmark with more than 3000 hours of synthetic speech from 7 domains, 6 TTS systems, 12 vocoders, and 3 languages. We found that all distribution shifts degraded model performance, and contrary to prior findings, training on more vocoders, speakers, or with data augmentation did not guarantee better generalization. In fact, we found that training on less diverse data resulted in better generalization, and that a detector fit using samples from a single carefully selected vocoder and a single speaker achieved state-of-the-art results on the challenging In-the-Wild benchmark.

Title: MonoDETR: Depth-guided Transformer for Monocular 3D Object Detection
Authors: Renrui Zhang, Han Qiu, Tai Wang, Ziyu Guo, Yiwen Tang, Xuanzhuo Xu, Ziteng Cui, Yu Qiao, Peng Gao, Hongsheng Li
Abstract: Monocular 3D object detection has long been a challenging task in autonomous driving. Most existing methods follow conventional 2D detectors to first localize object centers, and then predict 3D attributes by neighboring features. However, only using local visual features is insufficient to understand the scene-level 3D spatial structures and ignores the long-range inter-object depth relations. In this paper, we introduce the first DETR framework for Monocular DEtection with a depth-guided TRansformer, named MonoDETR. We modify the vanilla transformer to be depth-aware and guide the whole detection process by contextual depth cues. Specifically, concurrent to the visual encoder that captures object appearances, we introduce to predict a foreground depth map, and specialize a depth encoder to extract non-local depth embeddings. Then, we formulate 3D object candidates as learnable queries and propose a depth-guided decoder to conduct object-scene depth interactions. In this way, each object query estimates its 3D attributes adaptively from the depth-guided regions on the image and is no longer constrained to local visual features. On KITTI benchmark with monocular images as input, MonoDETR achieves state-of-the-art performance and requires no extra dense depth annotations. Besides, our depth-guided modules can also be plug-and-play to enhance multi-view 3D object detectors on nuScenes dataset, demonstrating our superior generalization capacity.

Title: Toward A Dynamic Comfort Model for Human-Building Interaction in Grid-Interactive Efficient Buildings: Supported by Field Data
Authors: SungKu Kang, Kunind Sharma, Maharshi Pathak, Emily Casavant, Katherine Bassett, Misha Pavel, David Fannon, Michael Kane
Abstract: Controlling building electric loads could alleviate the increasing grid strain caused by the adoption of renewables and electrification. However, current approaches that automatically setback thermostats on the hottest day compromise their efficacy by neglecting human-building interaction (HBI). This study aims to define challenges and opportunities for developing engineering models of HBI to be used in the design of controls for grid-interactive efficient buildings (GEBs). Building system and measured and just-in-time surveyed psychophysiological data were collected from 41 participants in 20 homes from April-September. ASHRAE Standard 55 thermal comfort models for building design were evaluated with these data. Increased error bias was observed with increasing spatiotemporal temperature variations. Unsurprising, considering these models neglect such variance, but questioning their suitability for GEBs controlling thermostat setpoints, and given the observed 4°F intra-home spatial temperature variation. The results highlight opportunities for reducing these biases in GEBs through a paradigm shift to modeling discomfort instead of comfort, increasing use of low-cost sensors, and models that account for the observed dynamic occupant behavior: of the thermostat setpoint overrides made with 140-minutes of a previous setpoint change, 95% of small changes ( 2°F) were made with 120-minutes, while 95% of larger changes ( 10°F) were made within only 70-minutes.

Title: CDSD: Chinese Dysarthria Speech Database
Authors: Yan Wang, Mengyi Sun, Xinchen Kang, Jingting Li, Pengfei Guo, Ming Gao, Su-Jing Wang
Abstract: Dysarthric speech poses significant challenges for individuals with dysarthria, impacting their ability to communicate socially. Despite the widespread use of Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), accurately recognizing dysarthric speech remains a formidable task, largely due to the limited availability of dysarthric speech data. To address this gap, we developed the Chinese Dysarthria Speech Database (CDSD), the most extensive collection of Chinese dysarthria data to date, featuring 133 hours of recordings from 44 speakers. Our benchmarks reveal a best Character Error Rate (CER) of 16.4\%. Compared to the CER of 20.45\% from our additional human experiments, Dysarthric Speech Recognition (DSR) demonstrates its potential in significant improvement of communication for individuals with dysarthria. The CDSD database will be made publicly available at this http URL.

Title: A Polynomial Chaos Approach to Stochastic LQ Optimal Control: Error Bounds and Infinite-Horizon Results
Authors: Ruchuan Ou, Jonas Schießl, Michael Heinrich Baumann, Lars Grüne, Timm Faulwasser
Abstract: The stochastic linear--quadratic regulator problem subject to Gaussian disturbances is well known and usually addressed via a moment-based reformulation. Here, we leverage polynomial chaos expansions, which model random variables via series expansions in a suitable $\mathcal{L}^2$ probability space, to tackle the non-Gaussian case. We present the optimal solutions for finite and infinite horizons and we analyze the infinite-horizon asymptotics. We show that the limit of the optimal state-input trajectory is the unique solution to a corresponding stochastic stationary optimization problem in the sense of probability measures. Moreover, we provide a constructive error analysis for finite-dimensional polynomial chaos approximations of the optimal solutions and of the optimal stationary pair in non-Gaussian settings. A numerical example illustrates our findings.

Title: Fluid Antenna Array Enhanced Over-the-Air Computation
Authors: Deyou Zhang, Sicong Ye, Ming Xiao, Kezhi Wang, Marco Di Renzo, Mikael Skoglund
Abstract: Over-the-air computation (AirComp) has emerged as a promising technology for fast wireless data aggregation by harnessing the superposition property of wireless multiple-access channels. This paper investigates a fluid antenna (FA) array-enhanced AirComp system, employing the new degrees of freedom achieved by antenna movements. Specifically, we jointly optimize the transceiver design and antenna position vector (APV) to minimize the mean squared error (MSE) between target and estimated function values. To tackle the resulting highly non-convex problem, we adopt an alternating optimization technique to decompose it into three subproblems. These subproblems are then iteratively solved until convergence, leading to a locally optimal solution. Numerical results show that FA arrays with the proposed transceiver and APV design significantly outperform the traditional fixed-position antenna arrays in terms of MSE.

Title: Image and Point-cloud Classification for Jet Analysis in High-Energy Physics: A survey
Authors: Hamza Kheddar, Yassine Himeur, Abbes Amira, Rachik Soualah
Abstract: Nowadays, there has been a growing trend in the field of high-energy physics (HEP), in both its experimental and phenomenological studies, to incorporate machine learning (ML) and its specialized branch, deep learning (DL). This review paper provides a thorough illustration of these applications using different ML and DL approaches. The first part of the paper examines the basics of various particle physics types and establishes guidelines for assessing particle physics alongside the available learning models. Next, a detailed classification is provided for representing Jets that are reconstructed in high-energy collisions, mainly in proton-proton collisions at well-defined beam energies. This section covers various datasets, preprocessing techniques, and feature extraction and selection methods. The presented techniques can be applied to future hadron-hadron colliders (HHC), such as the high-luminosity LHC (HL-LHC) and the future circular collider - hadron-hadron (FCChh). The authors then explore several AI techniques analyses designed specifically for both image and point-cloud (PC) data in HEP. Additionally, a closer look is taken at the classification associated with Jet tagging in hadron collisions. In this review, various state-of-the-art (SOTA) techniques in ML and DL are examined, with a focus on their implications for HEP demands. More precisely, this discussion addresses various applications in extensive detail, such as Jet tagging, Jet tracking, particle classification, and more. The review concludes with an analysis of the current state of HEP using DL methodologies. It highlights the challenges and potential areas for future research, which are illustrated for each application.

Title: Port-Hamiltonian Architectural Bias for Long-Range Propagation in Deep Graph Networks
Authors: Simon Heilig, Alessio Gravina, Alessandro Trenta, Claudio Gallicchio, Davide Bacciu
Abstract: The dynamics of information diffusion within graphs is a critical open issue that heavily influences graph representation learning, especially when considering long-range propagation. This calls for principled approaches that control and regulate the degree of propagation and dissipation of information throughout the neural flow. Motivated by this, we introduce (port-)Hamiltonian Deep Graph Networks, a novel framework that models neural information flow in graphs by building on the laws of conservation of Hamiltonian dynamical systems. We reconcile under a single theoretical and practical framework both non-dissipative long-range propagation and non-conservative behaviors, introducing tools from mechanical systems to gauge the equilibrium between the two components. Our approach can be applied to general message-passing architectures, and it provides theoretical guarantees on information conservation in time. Empirical results prove the effectiveness of our port-Hamiltonian scheme in pushing simple graph convolutional architectures to state-of-the-art performance in long-range benchmarks.

Title: FH-DRL: Exponential-Hyperbolic Frontier Heuristics with DRL for accelerated Exploration in Unknown Environments
Authors: Seunghyeop Nam, Tuan Anh Nguyen, Eunmi Choi, Dugki Min
Abstract: Autonomous robot exploration in large-scale or cluttered environments remains a central challenge in intelligent vehicle applications, where partial or absent prior maps constrain reliable navigation. This paper introduces FH-DRL, a novel framework that integrates a customizable heuristic function for frontier detection with a Twin Delayed DDPG (TD3) agent for continuous, high-speed local navigation. The proposed heuristic relies on an exponential-hyperbolic distance score, which balances immediate proximity against long-range exploration gains, and an occupancy-based stochastic measure, accounting for environmental openness and obstacle densities in real time. By ranking frontiers using these adaptive metrics, FH-DRL targets highly informative yet tractable waypoints, thereby minimizing redundant paths and total exploration time. We thoroughly evaluate FH-DRL across multiple simulated and real-world scenarios, demonstrating clear improvements in travel distance and completion time over frontier-only or purely DRL-based exploration. In structured corridor layouts and maze-like topologies, our architecture consistently outperforms standard methods such as Nearest Frontier, Cognet Frontier Exploration, and Goal Driven Autonomous Exploration. Real-world tests with a Turtlebot3 platform further confirm robust adaptation to previously unseen or cluttered indoor spaces. The results highlight FH-DRL as an efficient and generalizable approach for frontier-based exploration in large or partially known environments, offering a promising direction for various autonomous driving, industrial, and service robotics tasks.

Title: MDSGen: Fast and Efficient Masked Diffusion Temporal-Aware Transformers for Open-Domain Sound Generation
Authors: Trung X. Pham, Tri Ton, Chang D. Yoo
Abstract: We introduce MDSGen, a novel framework for vision-guided open-domain sound generation optimized for model parameter size, memory consumption, and inference speed. This framework incorporates two key innovations: (1) a redundant video feature removal module that filters out unnecessary visual information, and (2) a temporal-aware masking strategy that leverages temporal context for enhanced audio generation accuracy. In contrast to existing resource-heavy Unet-based models, \texttt{MDSGen} employs denoising masked diffusion transformers, facilitating efficient generation without reliance on pre-trained diffusion models. Evaluated on the benchmark VGGSound dataset, our smallest model (5M parameters) achieves $97.9$% alignment accuracy, using $172\times$ fewer parameters, $371$% less memory, and offering $36\times$ faster inference than the current 860M-parameter state-of-the-art model ($93.9$% accuracy). The larger model (131M parameters) reaches nearly $99$% accuracy while requiring $6.5\times$ fewer parameters. These results highlight the scalability and effectiveness of our approach.

Title: Enhancing Learned Image Compression via Cross Window-based Attention
Authors: Priyanka Mudgal, Feng Liu
Abstract: In recent years, learned image compression methods have demonstrated superior rate-distortion performance compared to traditional image compression methods. Recent methods utilize convolutional neural networks (CNN), variational autoencoders (VAE), invertible neural networks (INN), and transformers. Despite their significant contributions, a main drawback of these models is their poor performance in capturing local redundancy. Therefore, to leverage global features along with local redundancy, we propose a CNN-based solution integrated with a feature encoding module. The feature encoding module encodes important features before feeding them to the CNN and then utilizes cross-scale window-based attention, which further captures local redundancy. Cross-scale window-based attention is inspired by the attention mechanism in transformers and effectively enlarges the receptive field. Both the feature encoding module and the cross-scale window-based attention module in our architecture are flexible and can be incorporated into any other network architecture. We evaluate our method on the Kodak and CLIC datasets and demonstrate that our approach is effective and on par with state-of-the-art methods. Our code is publicly available at this https URL. .

Title: Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector
Authors: Yachao Yuan, Yu Huang, Yali Yuan, Jin Wang
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

Title: Investigation of Holographic Beamforming via Dynamic Metasurface Antennas in QoS Guaranteed Power Efficient Networks
Authors: Askin Altinoklu, Leila Musavian
Abstract: This work focuses on designing a power-efficient network for Dynamic Metasurface Antennas (DMA)-aided multi-user multiple-input single-output (MISO) antenna systems. Power efficiency is achieved through holographic beamforming in a DMA-aided network, minimizing total transmission power while ensuring a guaranteed signal-to-noise-and-interference ratio (SINR) for multiple users in downlink. Unlike conventional MISO systems, which have well-explored beamforming solutions, DMA require specialized methods due to their unique physical constraints and wave-domain precoding capabilities. To achieve this, optimization algorithms relying on alternating optimization and semi-definite programming, are developed, including spherical-wave channel modelling of near-field communication. In this setup, the beamforming performance of DMA-aided precoding is analyzed in comparison to its optimal limits and traditional fully digital (FD) architectures, considering the effects of the Lorentzian constraints of metasurfaces and the degree of freedom (DoF) limitations due to a reduced number of RF chains. We demonstrate that the performance gap caused by DoF constraints becomes more significant as the number of users increases, highlighting the trade-offs of DMA in high-density wireless networks.

Title: NBM: an Open Dataset for the Acoustic Monitoring of Nocturnal Migratory Birds in Europe
Authors: Louis Airale, Adrien Pajot, Juliette Linossier
Abstract: The persisting threats on migratory bird populations highlight the urgent need for effective monitoring techniques that could assist in their conservation. Among these, passive acoustic monitoring is an essential tool, particularly for nocturnal migratory species that are difficult to track otherwise. This work presents the Nocturnal Bird Migration (NBM) dataset, a collection of 13,359 annotated vocalizations from 117 species of the Western Palearctic. The dataset includes precise time and frequency annotations, gathered by dozens of bird enthusiasts across France, enabling novel downstream acoustic analysis. In particular, we prove the utility of this database by training an original two-stage deep object detection model tailored for the processing of audio data. While allowing the precise localization of bird calls in spectrograms, this model shows competitive accuracy on the 45 main species of the dataset with state-of-the-art systems trained on much larger audio collections. These results highlight the interest of fostering similar open-science initiatives to acquire costly but valuable fine-grained annotations of audio files. All data and code are made openly available.

Abstract: With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.

Title: Computing Capacity-Cost Functions for Continuous Channels in Wasserstein Space
Authors: Xinyang Li, Vlad C. Andrei, Ullrich J. Mönich, Fan Liu, Holger Boche
Abstract: This paper investigates the problem of computing capacity-cost (C-C) functions for continuous channels. Motivated by the Kullback-Leibler divergence (KLD) proximal reformulation of the classical Blahut-Arimoto (BA) algorithm, the Wasserstein distance is introduced to the proximal term for the continuous case, resulting in an iterative algorithm related to the Wasserstein gradient descent. Practical implementation involves moving particles along the negative gradient direction of the objective function's first variation in the Wasserstein space and approximating integrals by the importance sampling (IS) technique. Such formulation is also applied to the rate-distortion (R-D) function for continuous source spaces and thus provides a unified computation framework for both problems.

Title: Continuous Autoregressive Modeling with Stochastic Monotonic Alignment for Speech Synthesis
Authors: Weiwei Lin, Chenghan He
Abstract: We propose a novel autoregressive modeling approach for speech synthesis, combining a variational autoencoder (VAE) with a multi-modal latent space and an autoregressive model that uses Gaussian Mixture Models (GMM) as the conditional probability distribution. Unlike previous methods that rely on residual vector quantization, our model leverages continuous speech representations from the VAE's latent space, greatly simplifying the training and inference pipelines. We also introduce a stochastic monotonic alignment mechanism to enforce strict monotonic alignments. Our approach significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art autoregressive model VALL-E in both subjective and objective evaluations, achieving these results with only 10.3\% of VALL-E's parameters. This demonstrates the potential of continuous speech language models as a more efficient alternative to existing quantization-based speech language models.

Title: Visual-based spatial audio generation system for multi-speaker environments
Authors: Xiaojing Liu, Ogulcan Gurelli, Yan Wang, Joshua Reiss
Abstract: In multimedia applications such as films and video games, spatial audio techniques are widely employed to enhance user experiences by simulating 3D sound: transforming mono audio into binaural formats. However, this process is often complex and labor-intensive for sound designers, requiring precise synchronization of audio with the spatial positions of visual components. To address these challenges, we propose a visual-based spatial audio generation system - an automated system that integrates face detection YOLOv8 for object detection, monocular depth estimation, and spatial audio techniques. Notably, the system operates without requiring additional binaural dataset training. The proposed system is evaluated against existing Spatial Audio generation system using objective metrics. Experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly improves spatial consistency between audio and video, enhances speech quality, and performs robustly in multi-speaker scenarios. By streamlining the audio-visual alignment process, the proposed system enables sound engineers to achieve high-quality results efficiently, making it a valuable tool for professionals in multimedia production.

Title: Global linearization without hyperbolicity
Authors: Matthew D. Kvalheim, Eduardo D. Sontag
Abstract: We give a proof of an extension of the Hartman-Grobman theorem to nonhyperbolic but asymptotically stable equilibria of vector fields. Moreover, the linearizing topological conjugacy is (i) defined on the entire basin of attraction if the vector field is complete, and (ii) a $C^{k\geq 1}$ diffeomorphism on the complement of the equilibrium if the vector field is $C^k$ and the underlying space is not $5$-dimensional. We also show that the $C^k$ statement in the $5$-dimensional case is equivalent to the $4$-dimensional smooth Poincaré conjecture.
