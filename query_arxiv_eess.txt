Title: Frequency-Aware Sparse Optimization for Diagnosing Grid Instabilities and Collapses
Authors: Swadesh Vhakta, Denis Osipov, Reetam Sen Biswas, Amritanshu Pandey, Seyyedali Hosseinalipour, Shimiao Li
Abstract: This paper aims to proactively diagnose and manage frequency instability risks from a steady-state perspective, without the need for derivative-dependent transient modeling. Specifically, we jointly address two questions (Q1) Survivability: following a disturbance and the subsequent primary frequency response, can the system settle into a healthy steady state (feasible with an acceptable frequency deviation $\Delta f$)? (Q2) Dominant Vulnerability: if found unstable, what critical vulnerabilities create instability and/or full collapse? To address these questions, we first augment steady-state power flow states to include frequency-dependent governor relationships (i.e., governor power flow). Afterwards, we propose a frequency-aware sparse optimization that finds the minimal set of bus locations with measurable compensations (corrective actions) to enforce power balance and maintain frequency within predefined/acceptable bounds. We evaluate our method on standard transmission systems to empirically validate its ability to localize dominant sources of vulnerabilities. For a 1354-bus large system, our method detects compensations to only four buses under N-1 generation outage (3424.8 MW) while enforcing a maximum allowable steady-state frequency drop of 0.06 Hz (otherwise, frequency drops by nearly 0.08 Hz). We further validate the scalability of our method, requiring less than four minutes to obtain sparse solutions for the 1354-bus system.

Title: EvoPS: Evolutionary Patch Selection for Whole Slide Image Analysis in Computational Pathology
Authors: Saya Hashemian, Azam Asilian Bidgoli
Abstract: In computational pathology, the gigapixel scale of Whole-Slide Images (WSIs) necessitates their division into thousands of smaller patches. Analyzing these high-dimensional patch embeddings is computationally expensive and risks diluting key diagnostic signals with many uninformative patches. Existing patch selection methods often rely on random sampling or simple clustering heuristics and typically fail to explicitly manage the crucial trade-off between the number of selected patches and the accuracy of the resulting slide representation. To address this gap, we propose EvoPS (Evolutionary Patch Selection), a novel framework that formulates patch selection as a multi-objective optimization problem and leverages an evolutionary search to simultaneously minimize the number of selected patch embeddings and maximize the performance of a downstream similarity search task, generating a Pareto front of optimal trade-off solutions. We validated our framework across four major cancer cohorts from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) using five pretrained deep learning models to generate patch embeddings, including both supervised CNNs and large self-supervised foundation models. The results demonstrate that EvoPS can reduce the required number of training patch embeddings by over 90% while consistently maintaining or even improving the final classification F1-score compared to a baseline that uses all available patches' embeddings selected through a standard extraction pipeline. The EvoPS framework provides a robust and principled method for creating efficient, accurate, and interpretable WSI representations, empowering users to select an optimal balance between computational cost and diagnostic performance.

Title: ARGUS: A Framework for Risk-Aware Path Planning in Tactical UGV Operations
Authors: Nuno Soares, António Grilo
Abstract: This thesis presents the development of ARGUS, a framework for mission planning for Unmanned Ground Vehicles (UGVs) in tactical environments. The system is designed to translate battlefield complexity and the commander's intent into executable action plans. To this end, ARGUS employs a processing pipeline that takes as input geospatial terrain data, military intelligence on existing threats and their probable locations, and mission priorities defined by the commander. Through a set of integrated modules, the framework processes this information to generate optimized trajectories that balance mission objectives against the risks posed by threats and terrain characteristics. A fundamental capability of ARGUS is its dynamic nature, which allows it to adapt plans in real-time in response to unforeseen events, reflecting the fluid nature of the modern battlefield. The system's interoperability were validated in a practical exercise with the Portuguese Army, where it was successfully demonstrated that the routes generated by the model can be integrated and utilized by UGV control systems. The result is a decision support tool that not only produces an optimal trajectory but also provides the necessary insights for its execution, thereby contributing to greater effectiveness and safety in the employment of autonomous ground systems.

Title: Over-the-Air Transmission of Zak-OTFS on mmWave Communications Testbed
Authors: Sabarinath Ramachandran, Venkatesh Khammammetti, Prasanthi Maddala, Narayan Mandayam, Ivan Seskar, Robert Calderbank
Abstract: Millimeter-wave (mmWave) communication offers vast bandwidth for next-generation wireless systems but faces severe path loss, Doppler effects, and hardware impairments. Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has emerged as a robust waveform for high-mobility and doubly dispersive channels, outperforming OFDM under strong Doppler. However, the most studied multicarrier OTFS (MC-OTFS) is not easily predictable because the input-output (I$/$O) relation is not given by (twisted) convolution. Recently, the Zak-transform based OTFS (Zak-OTFS or OTFS 2$.$0) was proposed, which provides a single domain delay Doppler (DD) processing framework with predictable I$/$O behavior. This paper presents one of the first over-the-air (OTA) demonstrations of Zak-OTFS at mmWave frequencies. We design a complete Zak-OTFS based mmWave OTA system featuring root-raised-cosine (RRC) filtering for enhanced DD-domain predictability, higher-order modulations up to 16-QAM, and a low-overhead preamble for synchronization. A comprehensive signal model incorporating carrier frequency offset (CFO) and timing impairments is developed, showing these effects can be jointly captured within the effective DD-domain channel. Experimental validation on the COSMOS testbed confirms the feasibility and robustness of Zak-OTFS under realistic mmWave conditions, highlighting its potential for efficient implementations in beyond-5G and 6G systems.

Title: Distributed Adaptive Estimation over Sensor Networks with Partially Unknown Source Dynamics
Authors: Moh Kamalul Wafi, Hamidreza Montazeri Hedesh, Milad Siami
Abstract: This paper studies distributed adaptive estimation over sensor networks with partially known source dynamics. We present parallel continuous-time and discrete-time designs in which each node runs a local adaptive observer and exchanges information over a directed graph. For both time scales, we establish stability of the network coupling operators, prove boundedness of all internal signals, and show convergence of each node estimate to the source despite model uncertainty and disturbances. We further derive input-to-state stability (ISS) bounds that quantify robustness to bounded process noise. A key distinction is that the discrete-time design uses constant adaptive gains and per-step regressor normalization to handle sampling effects, whereas the continuous-time design does not. A unified Lyapunov framework links local observer dynamics with graph topology. Simulations on star, cyclic, and path networks corroborate the analysis, demonstrating accurate tracking, robustness, and scalability with the number of sensing nodes.

Title: Evolutionary Analysis of Continuous-time Finite-state Mean Field Games with Discounted Payoffs
Authors: Leonardo Pedroso, Andrea Agazzi, W.P.M.H. Heemels, Mauro Salazar
Abstract: We consider a class of continuous-time dynamic games involving a large number of players. Each player selects actions from a finite set and evolves through a finite set of states. State transitions occur stochastically and depend on the player's chosen action. A player's single-stage reward depends on their state, action, and the population-wide distribution of states and actions, capturing aggregate effects such as congestion in traffic networks. Each player seeks to maximize a discounted infinite-horizon reward. Existing evolutionary game-theoretic approaches introduce a model for the way individual players update their decisions in static environments without individual state dynamics. In contrast, this work develops an evolutionary framework for dynamic games with explicit state evolution, which is necessary to model many applications. We introduce a mean field approximation of the finite-population game and establish approximation guarantees. Since state-of-the-art solution concepts for dynamic games lack an evolutionary interpretation, we propose a new concept - the Mixed Stationary Nash Equilibrium (MSNE) - which admits one. We characterize an equivalence between MSNE and the rest points of the proposed mean field evolutionary model and we give conditions for the evolutionary stability of MSNE.

Title: Fractional Programming and Manifold Optimization for Reciprocal BD-RIS Scattering Matrix Design
Authors: Marko Fidanovski, Iván Alexander Morales Sandoval, Kuranage Roche Rayan Ranasinghe, Giuseppe Thadeu Freitas de Abreu, Emil Björnson, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: We investigate the problem of maximizing the sum-rate performance of a beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surface (BD-RIS)-aided multi-user (MU)-multiple-input single-output (MISO) system using fractional programming (FP) techniques. More specifically, we leverage the Lagrangian Dual Transform (LDT) and Quadratic Transform (QT) to derive an equivalent objective function which is then solved iteratively via a manifold optimization framework. It is shown that these techniques reduce the complexity of the optimization problem for the scattering matrix solution, while also providing notable performance gains compared to state-of-the-art (SotA) methods under the same system conditions. Simulation results confirm the effectiveness of the proposed method in improving sum-rate performance.

Title: Synergistic Development of Cybersecurity and Functional Safety for Smart Electric Vehicles
Authors: Siddhesh Pimpale
Abstract: The introduction of Smart Electric Vehicles (SEVs) represents an increasingly disruption on automotive area, once integrates advanced computer and communication technologies to highly electrical cars, which come with high performances, environment friendly and user friendly characteristics . But the increasing complexity of SEVs prompted by greater dependence on interconnected systems, autonomous capabilities and electrification, presents new challenges in cybersecurity as well as functional safety. The safety and reliability of such vehicles is paramount, as unsafe or unreliable operation in either case represents an unacceptable risk in terms of the performance of the vehicle and safety of the passenger. This paper investigates the integrated development of cybersecurity and functional safety for SEVs, emphasizing the requirement for the parallel development of these domains as components that are not treated separately. In SEVs, cybersecurity is quite crucial in order to prevent the threats of hacking, data breaches and unauthorized access to vehicle systems. Functional safety ensures that important vehicle functions (braking, steering, battery control, etc.) keep working even if some part fails. This convergence of functional safety issues with cybersecurity issues is becoming more crucial, since a security incident can result in a failure of catastrophic consequences for a functional safety system and, conversely. This paper reports the current state of cybersecurity and functional safety standards for SEVs, highlighting challenges that include the weaknesses of communication networks, the potential security threats of over-the-air updates, and the demand for real-time responsive systems for failure.

Title: AURORA: Autonomous Updating of ROM and Controller via Recursive Adaptation
Authors: Jiachen Li, Shihao Li, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: Real-time model-based control of high-dimensional nonlinear systems faces computational intractability, while traditional reduced-order model (ROM) control requires manual expert tuning without online adaptation. We propose AURORA (\textbf{A}utonomous \textbf{U}pdating of \textbf{RO}M and Controller via \textbf{R}ecursive \textbf{A}daptation), a multi-agent LLM framework automating ROM-based controller design with online adaptation. AURORA employs five specialized agents collaborating through iterative generation-judge-revision cycles, with an Evaluation Agent diagnosing degradation sources and routing corrections appropriately. Validated on eight benchmark systems spanning mechanical assemblies, thermal PDEs, and robots. Comparative evaluation across five state-of-the-art LLMs demonstrates high autonomy with minimal intervention, establishing practical viability for autonomous control design.

Title: A Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model for Generalized Power System Time-Series Data Analytics
Authors: Zhenghao Zhou, Yiyan Li, Xinjie Yu, Runlong Liu, Zelin Guo, Zheng Yan, Mo-Yuen Chow, Yuqi Yang, Yang Xu
Abstract: Power system time series analytics is critical in understanding the system operation conditions and predicting the future trends. Despite the wide adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) tools, many AI-based time series analytical models suffer from task-specificity (i.e. one model for one task) and structural rigidity (i.e. the input-output format is fixed), leading to limited model performances and resource wastes. In this paper, we propose a Causal-Guided Multimodal Large Language Model (CM-LLM) that can solve heterogeneous power system time-series analysis tasks. First, we introduce a physics-statistics combined causal discovery mechanism to capture the causal relationship, which is represented by graph, among power system variables. Second, we propose a multimodal data preprocessing framework that can encode and fuse text, graph and time series to enhance the model performance. Last, we formulate a generic "mask-and-reconstruct" paradigm and design a dynamic input-output padding mechanism to enable CM-LLM adaptive to heterogeneous time-series analysis tasks with varying sample lengths. Simulation results based on open-source LLM Qwen and real-world dataset demonstrate that, after simple fine-tuning, the proposed CM-LLM can achieve satisfying accuracy and efficiency on three heterogeneous time-series analytics tasks: missing data imputation, forecasting and super resolution.

Title: Generative Decoding of Compressed CSI for MIMO Precoding Design
Authors: Hao Luo, Saeed R. Khosravirad, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: Massive MIMO systems can enhance spectral and energy efficiency, but they require accurate channel state information (CSI), which becomes costly as the number of antennas increases. While machine learning (ML) autoencoders show promise for CSI reconstruction and reducing feedback overhead, they introduce new challenges with standardization, interoperability, and backward compatibility. Also, the significant data collection needed for training makes real-world deployment difficult. To overcome these drawbacks, we propose an ML-based, decoder-only solution for compressed CSI. Our approach uses a standardized encoder for CSI compression on the user side and a site-specific generative decoder at the base station to refine the compressed CSI using environmental knowledge. We introduce two training schemes for the generative decoder: An end-to-end method and a two-stage method, both utilizing a goal-oriented loss function. Furthermore, we reduce the data collection overhead by using a site-specific digital twin to generate synthetic CSI data for training. Our simulations highlight the effectiveness of this solution across various feedback overhead regimes.

Title: Deep generative priors for robust and efficient electron ptychography
Authors: Arthur R. C. McCray, Stephanie M. Ribet, Georgios Varnavides, Colin Ophus
Abstract: Electron ptychography enables dose-efficient atomic-resolution imaging, but conventional reconstruction algorithms suffer from noise sensitivity, slow convergence, and extensive manual hyperparameter tuning for regularization, especially in three-dimensional multislice reconstructions. We introduce a deep generative prior (DGP) framework for electron ptychography that uses the implicit regularization of convolutional neural networks to address these challenges. Two DGPs parameterize the complex-valued sample and probe within an automatic-differentiation mixed-state multislice forward model. Compared to pixel-based reconstructions, DGPs offer four key advantages: (i) greater noise robustness and improved information limits at low dose; (ii) markedly faster convergence, especially at low spatial frequencies; (iii) improved depth regularization; and (iv) minimal user-specified regularization. The DGP framework promotes spatial coherence and suppresses high-frequency noise without extensive tuning, and a pre-training strategy stabilizes reconstructions. Our results establish DGP-enabled ptychography as a robust approach that reduces expertise barriers and computational cost, delivering robust, high-resolution imaging across diverse materials and biological systems.

Title: Deep-Learning-based Frequency-Domain Watermarking for Energy System Time Series Data Asset Protection
Authors: Zhenghao Zhou, Yiyan Li, Xinjie Yu, Jian Ping, Xiaoyuan Xu, Zheng Yan, Mohammad Shahidehpour
Abstract: Data has been regarded as a valuable asset with the fast development of artificial intelligence technologies. In this paper, we introduce deep-learning neural network-based frequency-domain watermarking for protecting energy system time series data assets and secure data authenticity when being shared or traded across communities. First, the concept and desired watermarking characteristics are introduced. Second, a deep-learning neural network-based watermarking model with specially designed loss functions and network structure is proposed to embed watermarks into the original dataset. Third, a frequency-domain data preprocessing method is proposed to eliminate the frequency bias of neural networks when learning time series datasets to enhance the model performances. Last, a comprehensive watermarking performance evaluation framework is designed for measuring its invisibility, restorability, robustness, secrecy, false-positive detection, generalization, and capacity. Case studies based on practical load and photovoltaic time series datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.

Title: Experimental Evaluation of Fuzzy-Integral and Classical controls for Power Management in a 24 GHz mmWave 5G Transceiver
Authors: Karel Walter Gomez Orellana, Berthyn Rodrigo Tiñini Chuquimia, Juan Carlos Paredes Condori, Rodrigo Apaza Huanca, Hugo Orlando Condori Quispe
Abstract: The deployment of 5G millimeter-wave (mmWave) systems poses significant challenges in maintaining power amplifier linearity and efficiency under varying conditions, such as temperature-induced gain variations that degrade error vector magnitude (EVM). This paper presents a comparative study of three control strategies-PID, pure integral, and fuzzy-integral (FI)-for adaptive power management in a 24 GHz mmWave transceiver. The FI controller integrates fuzzy logic for handling nonlinearities with integral action for zero steady-state error. Experimental results show the FI controller outperforms others in settling time, stability, and EVM minimization.

Title: Deep Learning Analysis of Prenatal Ultrasound for Identification of Ventriculomegaly
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Inok Lee, Robin Ducharme, Aylin Erman, Olivier X. Miguel, Kevin Dick, Adrian D. C. Chan, Steven Hawken, Mark Walker, Felipe Moretti
Abstract: The proposed study aimed to develop a deep learning model capable of detecting ventriculomegaly on prenatal ultrasound images. Ventriculomegaly is a prenatal condition characterized by dilated cerebral ventricles of the fetal brain and is important to diagnose early, as it can be associated with an increased risk for fetal aneuploidies and/or underlying genetic syndromes. An Ultrasound Self-Supervised Foundation Model with Masked Autoencoding (USF-MAE), recently developed by our group, was fine-tuned for a binary classification task to distinguish fetal brain ultrasound images as either normal or showing ventriculomegaly. The USF-MAE incorporates a Vision Transformer encoder pretrained on more than 370,000 ultrasound images from the OpenUS-46 corpus. For this study, the pretrained encoder was adapted and fine-tuned on a curated dataset of fetal brain ultrasound images to optimize its performance for ventriculomegaly detection. Model evaluation was conducted using 5-fold cross-validation and an independent test cohort, and performance was quantified using accuracy, precision, recall, specificity, F1-score, and area under the receiver operating characteristic curve (AUC). The proposed USF-MAE model reached an F1-score of 91.76% on the 5-fold cross-validation and 91.78% on the independent test set, with much higher scores than those obtained by the baseline models by 19.37% and 16.15% compared to VGG-19, 2.31% and 2.56% compared to ResNet-50, and 5.03% and 11.93% compared to ViT-B/16, respectively. The model also showed a high mean test precision of 94.47% and an accuracy of 97.24%. The Eigen-CAM (Eigen Class Activation Map) heatmaps showed that the model was focusing on the ventricle area for the diagnosis of ventriculomegaly, which has explainability and clinical plausibility.

Title: Comparative Study of Q-Learning for State-Feedback LQG Control with an Unknown Model
Authors: Mingxiang Liu, Damián Marelli, Minyue Fu, Qianqian Cai
Abstract: We study the problem of designing a state feedback linear quadratic Gaussian (LQG) con- troller for a system in which the system matrices as well as the process noise covariance are unknown. We do a rigorous comparison between two approaches. The first is the classic one in which a system identification stage is used to estimate the unknown parameters, which are then used in a state-feedback LQG (SF-LQG) controller design. The second approach is a recently proposed one using a reinforcement learning paradigm called Q-learning. We do the comparison in terms of complexity and accuracy of the resulting controller. We show that the classic approach asymptotically efficient, giving virtually no room for improvement in terms of accuracy. We also propose a novel Q-learning-based method which we show asymptotically achieves the optimal controller design. We complement our proposed method with a numerically efficient algorithmic implementation aiming at making it competitive in terms of computations. Nevertheless, our complexity analysis shows that the classic approach is still numerically more efficient than this Q-learning-based alternative. We then conclude that the classic approach remains being the best choice for addressing the SF-LQG design in the case of unknown parameters.

Title: MA-Aided Hierarchical Hybrid Beamforming for Multi-User Wideband Beam Squint Mitigation
Authors: Cixiao Zhang, Yin Xu, Xinghao Guo, Xiaowu Ou, Dazhi He, Wenjun Zhang
Abstract: In wideband near-field arrays, frequency-dependent array responses cause wavefronts at different frequencies to deviate from that at the center frequency, producing beam squint and degrading multi-user performance. True-time-delay (TTD) circuits can realign the frequency dependence but require large delay ranges and intricate calibration, limiting scalability. Another line of work explores one- and two-dimensional array geometries, including linear, circular, and concentric circular, that exhibit distinct broadband behaviors such as different beam-squint sensitivities and focusing characteristics. These observations motivate adapting the array layout to enable wideband-friendly focusing and enhance multi-user performance without TTD networks. We propose a movable antenna (MA) aided architecture based on hierarchical sub-connected hybrid beamforming (HSC-HBF) in which antennas are grouped into tiles and only the tile centers are repositioned, providing slow geometric degrees of freedom that emulate TTD-like broadband focusing while keeping hardware and optimization complexity low. We show that the steering vector is inherently frequency dependent and that reconfiguring tile locations improves broadband focusing. Simulations across wideband near-field scenarios demonstrate robust squint suppression and consistent gains over fixed-layout arrays, achieving up to 5\% higher sum rate, with the maximum improvement exceeding 140\%.

Title: Conical Localization via Modified Polar Representation: A Unified Framework for Robust 3-D Positioning with 1-D Sensor Arrays
Authors: Ehsan Alamdari, Rouhollah Amiri
Abstract: This paper presents a unified framework for robust three-dimensional (3-D) source localization using a network of sensors equipped with one-dimensional (1-D) linear arrays. While such arrays offer practical advantages in terms of cost and size, existing localization methods suffer from a fundamental limitation: their performance degrades significantly as the source moves into the far-field, a common challenge known as the thresholding effect. To address this issue, we reformulate the localization problem in the modified polar representation (MPR) coordinate system, which parameterizes the source location using its azimuth, elevation, and inverse-range. We have developed a constrained weighted least squares (CWLS) estimator, which is subsequently transformed into a tight semidefinite programming (SDP) problem via semidefinite relaxation, enhanced with additional constraints to improve accuracy. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed estimator attains the Cramer-Rao lower bound (CRLB) for both angle and inverse-range estimation in near-field scenarios. More importantly, it maintains this optimal performance in the far-field, substantially outperforming state-of-the-art methods, which exhibit significant error at large ranges. The proposed solution thus provides a reliable, unified localization system that is effective irrespective of the source range.

Title: Toward Adaptive BCIs: Enhancing Decoding Stability via User State-Aware EEG Filtering
Authors: Yeon-Woo Choi, Hye-Bin Shin, Dan Li
Abstract: Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) often suffer from limited robustness and poor long-term adaptability. Model performance rapidly degrades when user attention fluctuates, brain states shift over time, or irregular artifacts appear during interaction. To mitigate these issues, we introduce a user state-aware electroencephalogram (EEG) filtering framework that refines neural representations before decoding user intentions. The proposed method continuously estimates the user's cognitive state (e.g., focus or distraction) from EEG features and filters unreliable segments by applying adaptive weighting based on the estimated attention level. This filtering stage suppresses noisy or out-of-focus epochs, thereby reducing distributional drift and improving the consistency of subsequent decoding. Experiments on multiple EEG datasets that emulate real BCI scenarios demonstrate that the proposed state-aware filtering enhances classification accuracy and stability across different user states and sessions compared with conventional preprocessing pipelines. These findings highlight that leveraging brain-derived state information--even without additional user labels--can substantially improve the reliability of practical EEG-based BCIs.

Title: Optimisation of Power Modulation for Hall-Héroult Cells: Process Operability and Constraints as Virtual Energy Storage
Authors: Choon-Jie Wong (1), Adam A. Larkin (1), Jie Bao (1), Maria Skyllas-Kazacos (1), Barry J. Welch (1), Nadia Ahli (2), Maitha Faraj (2), Mohamed Mahmoud (2) ((1) UNSW Sydney, (2) Emirates Global Aluminium)
Abstract: Aluminium is manufactured through the Hall-Héroult process, which is very energy intensive. Power modulation, as an industrial-scale demand-side power management approach, allows aluminium smelters to operate with variable power consumption rates and as such be powered by renewable energy sources. In this way, aluminium smelting cells can be used as a large virtual energy storage to balance power demand-supply and stabilise electrical grids. This paper studies the potential optimal power modulation operating conditions, including time-varying line current and anode-cathode distance (ACD) profiles to maximise the aluminium reduction cell profitability subject to constraints on the cell thermal balance. To deal with the complex cell dynamics which are spatially distributed and multi-timescale, a novel optimisation approach that utilises both reduced-order and detailed models is developed. The results yield insight into the optimal line current and ACD profiles for different power modulation scenarios including the time of use electricity tariff and spot price. These results can form the foundation for further studies into online control policies of aluminium reduction cells.

Title: From Natural Language to Certified H-infinity Controllers: Integrating LLM Agents with LMI-Based Synthesis
Authors: Shihao Li, Jiachen Li, Jiamin Xu, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: We present \textsc{S2C} (Specification-to-Certified-Controller), a multi-agent framework that maps natural-language requirements to certified $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ state-feedback controllers via LMI synthesis. \textsc{S2C} coordinates five roles -- \textit{SpecInt} (spec extraction), \textit{Solv} (bounded-real lemma (BRL) LMI), \textit{Tester} (Monte Carlo and frequency-domain checks), \textit{Adapt} (spec refinement), and \textit{CodeGen} (deployable code). The loop is stabilized by a severity- and iteration-aware $\gamma$-floor guardrail and a decay-rate region constraint enforcing $\Re\lambda(A{+}BK)<-\alpha$ with $\alpha=3.9/T_s$ derived from settling-time targets. For state feedback, verification reports disturbance rejection $\big\|C\,(sI-(A{+}BK))^{-1}E\big\|_\infty$ alongside time-domain statistics; discrete benchmarks are converted to continuous time via a Tustin (bilinear) transform when needed. On 14 COMPleib problems, \textsc{S2C} attains \textbf{100\%} synthesis success and \textbf{100\%} convergence within six iterations, with strong decay-rate satisfaction and near-target certified $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ levels; it improves robustness metrics relative to single-shot BRL and BRL+$\alpha$ baselines. An ablation over LLM backbones (GPT-5, GPT-5 mini, DeepSeek-V3, Qwen-2.5-72B, Llama-4 Maverick) shows the pipeline is robust across models, while stronger models yield the highest effectiveness. These results indicate that LLM agents can integrate certificate-bearing control synthesis from high-level intent, enabling rapid end-to-end prototyping without sacrificing formal guarantees.

Title: DynaQuant: Dynamic Mixed-Precision Quantization for Learned Image Compression
Authors: Youneng Bao, Yulong Cheng, Yiping Liu, Yichen Yang, Peng Qin, Mu Li, Yongsheng Liang
Abstract: Prevailing quantization techniques in Learned Image Compression (LIC) typically employ a static, uniform bit-width across all layers, failing to adapt to the highly diverse data distributions and sensitivity characteristics inherent in LIC models. This leads to a suboptimal trade-off between performance and efficiency. In this paper, we introduce DynaQuant, a novel framework for dynamic mixed-precision quantization that operates on two complementary levels. First, we propose content-aware quantization, where learnable scaling and offset parameters dynamically adapt to the statistical variations of latent features. This fine-grained adaptation is trained end-to-end using a novel Distance-aware Gradient Modulator (DGM), which provides a more informative learning signal than the standard Straight-Through Estimator. Second, we introduce a data-driven, dynamic bit-width selector that learns to assign an optimal bit precision to each layer, dynamically reconfiguring the network's precision profile based on the input data. Our fully dynamic approach offers substantial flexibility in balancing rate-distortion (R-D) performance and computational cost. Experiments demonstrate that DynaQuant achieves rd performance comparable to full-precision models while significantly reducing computational and storage requirements, thereby enabling the practical deployment of advanced LIC on diverse hardware platforms.

Title: An Innovations-Based Data-Driven Kalman Predictor for Predictive Control
Authors: Mohamed Abdalmoaty, Roy S. Smith
Abstract: A recently developed data-driven Kalman filter requires offline measurement of the process disturbance; a requirement that is often unmet for many practical applications. We propose a solution that parametrizes the Kalman filter exclusively using measured input and output data. The key idea is to use the innovations form which naturally accounts for the process disturbance and measurement noise into a single orthogonal stochastic process. Unlike process disturbances, the innovations process can be estimated directly from input-output data via a numerically efficient projection step. The performance of the method is demonstrated using a benchmark simulation.

Title: From Noise to Latent: Generating Gaussian Latents for INR-Based Image Compression
Authors: Chaoyi Lin, Yaojun Wu, Yue Li, Junru Li, Kai Zhang, Li Zhang
Abstract: Recent implicit neural representation (INR)-based image compression methods have shown competitive performance by overfitting image-specific latent codes. However, they remain inferior to end-to-end (E2E) compression approaches due to the absence of expressive latent representations. On the other hand, E2E methods rely on transmitting latent codes and requiring complex entropy models, leading to increased decoding complexity. Inspired by the normalization strategy in E2E codecs where latents are transformed into Gaussian noise to demonstrate the removal of spatial redundancy, we explore the inverse direction: generating latents directly from Gaussian noise. In this paper, we propose a novel image compression paradigm that reconstructs image-specific latents from a multi-scale Gaussian noise tensor, deterministically generated using a shared random seed. A Gaussian Parameter Prediction (GPP) module estimates the distribution parameters, enabling one-shot latent generation via reparameterization trick. The predicted latent is then passed through a synthesis network to reconstruct the image. Our method eliminates the need to transmit latent codes while preserving latent-based benefits, achieving competitive rate-distortion performance on Kodak and CLIC dataset. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to explore Gaussian latent generation for learned image compression.

Title: Automatic Music Mixing using a Generative Model of Effect Embeddings
Authors: Eloi Moliner, Marco A. Martínez-Ramírez, Junghyun Koo, Wei-Hsiang Liao, Kin Wai Cheuk, Joan Serrà, Vesa Välimäki, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Music mixing involves combining individual tracks into a cohesive mixture, a task characterized by subjectivity where multiple valid solutions exist for the same input. Existing automatic mixing systems treat this task as a deterministic regression problem, thus ignoring this multiplicity of solutions. Here we introduce MEGAMI (Multitrack Embedding Generative Auto MIxing), a generative framework that models the conditional distribution of professional mixes given unprocessed tracks. MEGAMI uses a track-agnostic effects processor conditioned on per-track generated embeddings, handles arbitrary unlabeled tracks through a permutation-equivariant architecture, and enables training on both dry and wet recordings via domain adaptation. Our objective evaluation using distributional metrics shows consistent improvements over existing methods, while listening tests indicate performances approaching human-level quality across diverse musical genres.

Title: Spacecraft Angular Rate Estimation via Event-Based Camera Sensing
Authors: Vittorio Franzese, Matteo El Hariry
Abstract: This paper presents a method for determining spacecraft angular rates using event-based camera sensing. This is achieved by analyzing the temporal distribution of brightness events triggered by the apparent motion of stars. The location and polarity of the events are used to infer the apparent motion field of the stars, which is, in turn, employed to estimate the observer angular velocity in the camera frame. This can be converted to the spacecraft angular rates provided an attitude reference. The method is validated through numerical simulation for a synthetic dataset of event streams generated on random spacecraft pointing and rates conditions. The accuracy of the method is assessed, demonstrating its potential to complement or replace conventional rate sensors in spacecraft systems using event camera sensing.

Title: Pruning as Regularization: Sensitivity-Aware One-Shot Pruning in ASR
Authors: Julian Irigoyen, Arthur Söhler, Andreas Søeborg Kirkedal
Abstract: We challenge the conventional view of neural network pruning as solely a compression technique, demonstrating that one-shot magnitude pruning serves as a powerful implicit regularizer for ASR. Using Whisper-small, we combine gradient- and Fisher-based sensitivity diagnostics with targeted, component-wise pruning. This reveals architectural asymmetries: decoder FFNs are pruning-fragile, whereas decoder self-attention and the last encoder layers contain redundancy that, when removed, improves generalization. Without fine-tuning, pruning 50% of decoder self-attention reduces WER by 2.38% absolute (20.44% relative) on LibriSpeech test-other; pruning the last four encoder layers at 50% instead yields a 1.72% absolute (14.8% relative) improvement. Gains persisted on Common Voice and TED-LIUM datasets. Beyond regularization benefits, our sensitivity-aware approach enables more aggressive one-shot compression. At 40% sparsity, where established global pruning approaches catastrophically fail, our method preserves near-baseline accuracy. This positions pruning as a first-class architectural design tool: knowing where to prune is as important as how much to prune.

Title: Quantizing Whisper-small: How design choices affect ASR performance
Authors: Arthur Söhler, Julian Irigoyen, Andreas Søeborg Kirkedal
Abstract: Large speech recognition models like Whisper-small achieve high accuracy but are difficult to deploy on edge devices due to their high computational demand. To this end, we present a unified, cross-library evaluation of post-training quantization (PTQ) on Whisper-small that disentangles the impact of quantization scheme, method, granularity, and bit-width. Our study is based on four libraries: PyTorch, Optimum-Quanto, HQQ, and bitsandbytes. Experiments on LibriSpeech test-clean and test-other show that dynamic int8 quantization with Quanto offers the best trade-off, reducing model size by 57% while improving on the baseline's word error rate. Static quantization performed worse, likely due to Whisper's Transformer architecture, while more aggressive formats (e.g., nf4, int3) achieved up to 71% compression at the cost of accuracy in noisy conditions. Overall, our results demonstrate that carefully chosen PTQ methods can substantially reduce model size and inference cost without retraining, enabling efficient deployment of Whisper-small on constrained hardware.

Title: Multi-layer barrier function-based adaptive super-twisting controller
Authors: Antoine Thibault Vié, Leonid Fridman, Roberto Galeazzi, Dimitrios Papageorgiou
Abstract: This article presents an adaptive Super-Twisting Sliding Mode Control framework for uncertain first-order systems, with rate-bounded perturbations, where the bound is constant but unknown. Positive definite barrier functions, when used in self-tuning super-twisting controllers may introduce some conservatism in relation to initial estimations of the perturbation rate bound. Moreover, discrete time implementation of the algorithm does not necessarily guarantee the boundedness of the closed-loop trajectories when sudden changes in the perturbation occur in between two time samples. The salient features of the proposed methodology pertain to extending the use of positive semidefinite barrier functions to Super-Twisting controller adaptation and the employment of a "nested barriers" scheme that ensures boundedness of the solutions even for "unfavourable" perturbations-to-sampling time ratios. The stability of the closed-loop system is assessed via Lyapunov analysis and simulations demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework.

Title: MA-enhanced Mixed Near-field and Far-field Covert Communications
Authors: Chao Zhou, Changsheng You, Cong Zhou, Hai Lin, Yi Gong
Abstract: In this paper, we propose to employ a modular-based movable extremely large-scale array (XL-array) at Alice for enhancing covert communication performance. Compared with existing work that mostly considered either far-field or near-field covert communications, we consider in this paper a more general and practical mixed-field scenario, where multiple Bobs are located in either the near-field or far-field of Alice, in the presence of multiple near-field Willies. Specifically, we first consider a two-Bob-one-Willie system and show that conventional fixed-position XL-arrays suffer degraded sum-rate performance due to the energy-spread effect in mixed-field systems, which, however, can be greatly improved by subarray movement. On the other hand, for transmission covertness, it is revealed that sufficient angle difference between far-field Bob and Willie as well as adequate range difference between near-field Bob and Willie are necessary for ensuring covertness in fixed-position XL-array systems, while this requirement can be relaxed in movable XL-array systems thanks to flexible channel correlation control between Bobs and Willie. Next, for general system setups, we formulate an optimization problem to maximize the achievable sum-rate under covertness constraint. To solve this non-convex optimization problem, we first decompose it into two subproblems, corresponding to an inner problem for beamforming optimization given positions of subarrays and an outer problem for subarray movement optimization. Although these two subproblems are still non-convex, we obtain their high-quality solutions by using the successive convex approximation technique and devising a customized differential evolution algorithm, respectively. Last, numerical results demonstrate the effectiveness of proposed movable XL-array in balancing sum-rate and covert communication requirements.

Title: Mutual Coupling Aware Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Multi-User mmWave Systems
Authors: Tian Qiu, Ruidong Li, Cunhua Pan, Taihaon Zhang, Dongnan Xia, Changhong Wang, Hong Ren
Abstract: This paper proposes a three-stage uplink channel estimation protocol for reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided multi-user (MU) millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems, where both the base station (BS) and the RIS are equipped with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). The proposed approach explicitly accounts for the mutual coupling (MC) effect, modeled via scattering parameter multiport network theory. In Stage~I, a dimension-reduced subspace-based method is proposed to estimate the common angle of arrival (AoA) at the BS using the received signals across all users. In Stage~II, MC-aware cascaded channel estimation is performed for a typical user. The equivalent measurement vectors for each cascaded path are extracted and the reference column is reconstructed using a compressed sensing (CS)-based approach. By leveraging the structure of the cascaded channel, the reference column is rearranged to estimate the AoA at the RIS, thereby reducing the computational complexity associated with estimating other columns. Additionally, the common angle of departure (AoD) at the RIS is also obtained in this stage, which significantly reduces the pilot overhead for estimating the cascaded channels of other users in Stage~III. The RIS phase shift training matrix is designed to optimize performance in the presence of MC and outperforms random phase scheme. Simulation results validate that the proposed method yields better performance than the MC-unaware and existing approaches in terms of estimation accuracy and pilot efficiency.

Title: DMA-aided MU-MISO Systems for Power Splitting SWIPT via Lorentzian-Constrained Holography
Authors: Askin Altinoklu, Leila Musavian
Abstract: This paper presents an optimal power splitting and beamforming design for co-located simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) users in Dynamic Metasurface Antenna (DMA)-aided multiuser multiple-input single-output (MISO) systems. The objective is to minimize transmit power while meeting users signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and energy harvesting (EH) requirements. The problem is solved via an alternating optimization framework based on semidefinite programming (SDP), where metasurface tunability follows Lorentzian-constrained holography (LCH). In contrast to traditional beamforming architectures, DMA-assisted architectures reduce the need for RF chains and phase shifters but require optimization under the Lorentzian constraint limiting the amplitude and phase optimizations. Hence, the proposed method integrates several LCH schemes, including the recently proposed adaptive-radius LCH (ARLCH), and evaluates nonlinear EH models and circuit noise effects. Simulation results show that the proposed design significantly reduces transmit power compared with baseline methods, highlighting the efficiency of ARLCH and optimal power splitting in DMA-assisted SWIPT systems.

Title: A Unified Theory for Transient Synchronization Stability Analysis of Renewable Dominated Power Systems
Authors: Meng Zhan, Miao Han, Yayao Zhang, Hongsheng Xu, Jiabing Hu, Shijie Cheng, Jürgen Kurths
Abstract: The change of electric power generation - from synchronous generator (SG) to converter - is generally regarded as the second revolution of power system. Different from rotor swing of SG in traditional grids mainly described by the swing equation (SE), the converter dynamics plays an indispensable role in modern renewable dominated power systems (RDPS). The high complexity of the RDPS, including spatial large-scale, nonlinearity, multi-time-scale, and even sequential switching, prevents us from fully understanding its dynamics and assessing its transient stability under large disturbance. Here, a variety of transient switching mechanism models of renewable devices relying on wind or solar energies under low-voltage ride-through are established and unified, which can be perfectly described by a generalized swing equation (GSE) under parameter changes for switching dynamics. The GSE focusing on the dominant phase-locking loop dynamics is similar to the SE. Mainly relying on the mechanical equivalence and the energy conservative principle, a substantially improved equal-area criterion method is proposed. Based on this method, even for large-scale renewable fields, the calculation errors for the critical clearing time are only about 1%. This elegant nonlinear-dynamics-based approach establishes a unified theory including modelling and analysis for the RDPS transient dynamics.

Title: Stability of Certainty-Equivalent Adaptive LQR for Linear Systems with Unknown Time-Varying Parameters
Authors: Marcell Bartos, Johannes Köhler, Florian Dörfler, Melanie N. Zeilinger
Abstract: Standard model-based control design deteriorates when the system dynamics change during operation. To overcome this challenge, online and adaptive methods have been proposed in the literature. In this work, we consider the class of discrete-time linear systems with unknown time-varying parameters. We propose a simple, modular, and computationally tractable approach by combining two classical and well-known building blocks from estimation and control: the least mean square filter and the certainty-equivalent linear quadratic regulator. Despite both building blocks being simple and off-the-shelf, our analysis shows that they can be seamlessly combined to a powerful pipeline with stability guarantees. Namely, finite-gain $\ell^2$-stability of the closed-loop interconnection of the unknown system, the parameter estimator, and the controller is proven, despite the presence of unknown disturbances and time-varying parametric uncertainties. Real-world applicability of the proposed algorithm is showcased by simulations carried out on a nonlinear planar quadrotor.

Title: Effective Capacity Analysis of Joint Near and Far-Field Communication in 6G URLLC Networks
Authors: Humera Hameed, Waqas Aman, Muhammad Mahboob Ur Rahman, Ali Arshad Nasir
Abstract: The emergence of 6G networks enables simultaneous near-field and far-field communications through extremely large antenna arrays and high carrier frequencies. While these regimes enhance spatial multiplexing and link capacity, their coexistence poses new challenges in ensuring quality-of-service (QoS) guarantees for delay-sensitive applications. This paper presents an effective capacity (EC) analysis framework that jointly models near- and far-field communication regimes under distance estimation uncertainty. The user location is modeled as a random variable spanning both propagation regions, and tractable closed-form expression for the EC is derived to quantify delay performance. Numerical results illustrate the impact of estimation variance, QoS exponent, far-field boundary and near- field boundary (Fraunhofer distance) on EC performance.

Title: PE-TSFM: Self-Supervised Time-Series Learning for Generalizable Power Converter Health Monitoring under Unseen Conditions
Authors: Xinyuan Liao, Xinyue Zhang, Xing Wei, Junwei Liu, Shuai Zhao, Siqi Bu, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Data-driven health monitoring of power converters remains limited by poor generalization to unseen operating conditions. This work addresses this out-of-distribution (OOD) challenge by building a domain-specific time-series foundation model (PE-TSFM) that learns representations directly from large-scale unlabeled converter data. Unlike generic TSFMs trained on broad time-series datasets, the proposed PE-TSFM is pre-trained entirely on domain data, enabling it to learn the physical relationships unique to power electronics. To further tailor the model to this domain, we introduce a dual-attention mechanism that captures both temporal patterns and inter-channel dependencies. While generic TSFMs primarily model temporal dependencies, the added channel attention captures inter-sensor physical relationships essential for converter degradation analysis. A dataset containing 141 million unlabeled timestamps from an operating power converter is used for pre-training. Experiments show that PE-TSFM achieves 92% accuracy under unseen operating conditions. In contrast, generic TSFMs achieve around 60% and conventional time-series models achieve around 40% accuracy. This result confirms the strong OOD generalization of the proposed PE-TSFM. Ablation studies further verify that the introduced channel attention mechanism significantly improves model performance. In addition, we conduct detailed studies on model scalability, hyperparameter sensitivity, and interpretability to provide a comprehensive understanding of the proposed approach.

The small signal model analysis and phase noise of the VCOs will be presented to evaluate the start-up oscillation condition, oscillation frequency, and phase noise affecting factors. Theoretical analysis and simulation results show the outperformance of the proposed cascode cross-couple LC VCO topology compared to the conventional cross-coupled LC VCO in terms of frequency tuning range, VCO gain and phase noise level.

Title: Extended Time Varying Multi-Cluster Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading Model for Maritime Environment
Authors: Antoine Thibault Vié, Roberto Galeazzi, Dimitrios Papagergiou
Abstract: The recent advancements in autonomous and remote operation of maritime vessels necessitates the development of robust and reliable communication systems to support high-bandwidth applications such as real-time monitoring, navigation, and control. Existing communication channel models, including Rayleigh and Rician fading, are inadequate to accurately describe the dynamic and complex nature of maritime communication, particularly for high-speed vessels in coastal environments. This paper proposes an extension to the Multi-Cluster Fluctuating Two-Ray Fading (MFTR) model that also accounts for key phenomena such as large-scale fading, time-varying parameters and Doppler shifts. The extended MFTR model integrates Stochastic Differential Equations (SDEs) to capture the time-varying characteristics of the channel, such as phase shifts and delays, while considering physical factors like delay-induced power loss and path loss. The accuracy of the proposed model is assessed in simulation.

Title: Power Hardware-in-the-loop Interfacing via $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ Model Matching
Authors: Jonathan Eid, Ashley Meagher, Dmitry Rimorov, Anil Kumar Bonala, Rajendra Thike, James Richard Forbes
Abstract: This paper presents an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ model matching control-based approach to the problem of power hardware-in-the-loop (PHIL) interfacing. The objective is to interconnect a grid simulation and a physical device via an interface in a way that is stable and accurate. Conventional approaches include the ideal transformer method (ITM) and its impedance-based variants, which trade accuracy for stability, as well as some $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control-based approaches, which do not make use of all the available information in their optimization for accuracy. Designing for transparency, as opposed to accuracy as existing approaches do, would achieve both accuracy and stability, while making use of all the dynamical information present in the idealized interconnection of the grid and device. The approach proposed in this paper employs model matching to formulate the PHIL problem as an $\mathcal{H}_\infty$ control problem using transparency as the explicit frequency-domain control objective. The approach is experimentally validated in a real-time resistive-load PHIL setup, and is found to achieve accuracy levels that are comparable or superior to those of an ITM-based interface.

Title: Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation and MCS-based Intelligent Layering
Authors: Dhrumil Bhatt
Abstract: The coexistence of heterogeneous service classes in 5G Enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBB), Ultra-Reliable Low Latency Communication (URLLC), and Massive Machine-Type Communication (mMTC) poses major challenges for meeting diverse Quality-of-Service (QoS) requirements under limited spectrum and power resources. Existing radio access network (RAN) slicing schemes typically optimise isolated layers or objectives, lacking physical-layer realism, slot-level adaptability, and interpretable per-slice performance metrics. This paper presents a joint optimisation framework that integrates Dynamic Hybrid Resource Utilisation with MCS-Based Intelligent Layering, formulated as a mixed-integer linear program (MILP) that jointly allocates bandwidth, power, and modulation and coding scheme (MCS) indices per slice. The model incorporates finite blocklength effects, channel misreporting, and correlated fading to ensure realistic operation. Two modes are implemented: a Baseline Mode that ensures resource-efficient QoS feasibility, and an Ideal-Chaser Mode that minimises deviation from ideal per-slice rates. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves energy efficiencies above $10^7$~kb/J in Baseline Mode and sub-millisecond latency with near-ideal throughput in Ideal-Chaser Mode, outperforming recent optimisation and learning-based methods in delay, fairness, and reliability. The framework provides a unified, interpretable, and computationally tractable solution for dynamic cross-layer resource management in 5G and beyond networks.

Title: Unifying Model and Layer Fusion for Speech Foundation Models
Authors: Yi-Jen Shih, David Harwath
Abstract: Speech Foundation Models have gained significant attention recently. Prior works have shown that the fusion of representations from multiple layers of the same model or the fusion of multiple models can improve performance on downstream tasks. We unify these two fusion strategies by proposing an interface module that enables fusion across multiple upstream speech models while integrating information across their layers. We conduct extensive experiments on different self-supervised and supervised models across various speech tasks, including ASR and paralinguistic analysis, and demonstrate that our method outperforms prior fusion approaches. We further analyze its scalability concerning model size and count, highlighting the importance of selecting appropriate upstream models. Our results show that the proposed interface provides an additional performance boost when given a suitable upstream model selection, making it a promising approach for utilizing Speech Foundation Models.

Title: Active Short Circuit and Safe Discharge Mechanisms in Multi-Phase Inverters During Critical Failures
Authors: Siddhesh Pimpale, Sagar Mahadik
Abstract: The multi-phase inverter has become more complicated, particularly in an Electric Vehicle (EV)'s power train, which requires a robust fault protection system. The proposed active short circuit and safe discharge mechanisms are also included in this work, dedicated to multi-phase converters in failure conditions. With silicon carbide (SiC) power modules increasingly used in high efficiency and high-power applications, the reliability under fault conditions is an extremely important factor. Cascading failures and permanent damage will occur in multi phase inverter systems if short circuit faults are not prevented. The proposed method combines one centralized short circuit detection, active phase shorting and controlled discharge to make these structures more robust. The on chip active short circuit mechanism isolates the affected phases quickly preventing faults from spreading to other areas of the inverter and the safe discharge mechanism controls energy discharged in fault scenarios, which reduces the thermal stress placed on essential components. The experimental results show that the proposed mechanisms can effectively enhance a fault detection performance, system response during faults, and the operation as whole at faults over the several existing methods. These mechanisms are demonstrated to be very important for enhancing the safety and reliability of multiphase inverters, especially for critical applications of such inverters as EV where high operational security is required.

Title: Generative AI Meets 6G and Beyond: Diffusion Models for Semantic Communications
Authors: Hai-Long Qin, Jincheng Dai, Guo Lu, Shuo Shao, Sixian Wang, Tongda Xu, Wenjun Zhang, Ping Zhang, Khaled B. Letaief
Abstract: Semantic communications mark a paradigm shift from bit-accurate transmission toward meaning-centric communication, essential as wireless systems approach theoretical capacity limits. The emergence of generative AI has catalyzed generative semantic communications, where receivers reconstruct content from minimal semantic cues by leveraging learned priors. Among generative approaches, diffusion models stand out for their superior generation quality, stable training dynamics, and rigorous theoretical foundations. However, the field currently lacks systematic guidance connecting diffusion techniques to communication system design, forcing researchers to navigate disparate literatures. This article provides the first comprehensive tutorial on diffusion models for generative semantic communications. We present score-based diffusion foundations and systematically review three technical pillars: conditional diffusion for controllable generation, efficient diffusion for accelerated inference, and generalized diffusion for cross-domain adaptation. In addition, we introduce an inverse problem perspective that reformulates semantic decoding as posterior inference, bridging semantic communications with computational imaging. Through analysis of human-centric, machine-centric, and agent-centric scenarios, we illustrate how diffusion models enable extreme compression while maintaining semantic fidelity and robustness. By bridging generative AI innovations with communication system design, this article aims to establish diffusion models as foundational components of next-generation wireless networks and beyond.

Title: Probabilistic Safety Guarantee for Stochastic Control Systems Using Average Reward MDPs
Authors: Saber Omidi, Marek Petrik, Se Young Yoon, Momotaz Begum
Abstract: Safety in stochastic control systems, which are subject to random noise with a known probability distribution, aims to compute policies that satisfy predefined operational constraints with high confidence throughout the uncertain evolution of the state variables. The unpredictable evolution of state variables poses a significant challenge for meeting predefined constraints using various control methods. To address this, we present a new algorithm that computes safe policies to determine the safety level across a finite state set. This algorithm reduces the safety objective to the standard average reward Markov Decision Process (MDP) objective. This reduction enables us to use standard techniques, such as linear programs, to compute and analyze safe policies. We validate the proposed method numerically on the Double Integrator and the Inverted Pendulum systems. Results indicate that the average-reward MDPs solution is more comprehensive, converges faster, and offers higher quality compared to the minimum discounted-reward solution.

Title: Computable Characterisations of Scaled Relative Graphs of Closed Operators
Authors: Talitha Nauta, Richard Pates
Abstract: Scaled Relative Graphs (SRGs) provide a promising tool for stability and robustness analysis of multi-input-multi-output systems. In this paper, we provide tools for exact and computable constructions of the SRG for closed linear operators, based on maximum and minimum gain computations. The results are suitable for bounded and unbounded operators, and we specify how they can be used to draw SRGs for the typical operators that are used to model linear-time-invariant dynamical systems. Furthermore, for the special case of state-space models, we show how the Bounded Real Lemma can be used to construct the SRG.

Title: Waveform-domain NOMA: An Enabler for ISAC in Uplink Transmission
Authors: Jialiang Zhu, Hamza Haif, Abdelali Arous, Huseyin Arslan, Arman Farhang
Abstract: According to the recent 3GPP decisions on 6G air interface, orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM)-based waveforms are the primary candidates for future integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems. In this paper, we consider a monostatic sensing scenario in which OFDM is used for the downlink and its reflected echo signal is used for sensing. OFDM and discrete Fourier transform-spread OFDM (DFT-s-OFDM) are the options for uplink transmission. When OFDM is used in the uplink, the power difference between this signal and the echo signal leads to a power-domain non-orthogonal multiple access (PD-NOMA) scenario. In contrast, adopting DFT-s-OFDM as uplink signal enables a waveform-domain NOMA(WD-NOMA). Affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM) and orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) have been proven to be DFT-s-OFDM based waveforms. This work focuses on such a WD-NOMA system, where AFDM or OTFS is used as uplink waveform and OFDM is employed for downlink transmission and sensing. We show that the OFDM signal exhibits additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN)-like behavior in the affine domain, allowing it to be modeled as white noise in uplink symbol detection. To enable accurate data detection performance, an AFDM frame design and a noise power estimation (NPE) method are developed. Furthermore, a two-dimensional orthogonal matching pursuit (2D-OMP) algorithm is applied for sensing by iteratively identifying delay-Doppler components of each target. Simulation results demonstrate that the WD-NOMA ISAC system, employing either AFDM or OTFS, outperforms the PD-NOMA ISAC system that uses only the OFDM waveform in terms of bit error rate (BER) performance. Furthermore, the proposed NPE method yields additional improvements in BER.

Title: Toward a Safety Argumentation Lifecycle for Automated Vehicles: Promoting Communication and Interdependency with System Lifecycle Processes
Authors: Marvin Loba, Robert Graubohm, Niklas Braun, Nayel Fabian Salem, Markus Maurer
Abstract: Despite the growing number of automated vehicles on public roads, operating such systems in open contexts will inevitably involve incidents. This results from an inherent risk in road traffic, which arises from multiple sources of complexity and can never be fully eliminated. One central challenge lies in developing a defensible case that the residual risk has been reduced to a reasonable level. While a safety argumentation is a common means to represent this case, there is a need to guide its creation and maintenance by adequate processes. In this paper, we derive requirements for a safety argumentation lifecycle based on examining the current state of the art. In particular, the requirement-driven process design accounts for both identified limitations of current process specifications and implicit knowledge contained in related work. Subsequently, we reflect on interdependencies between the resulting safety argumentation lifecycle and the system lifecycle. Moreover, we discuss a gap in literature regarding transparent ex ante risk communication. Correspondingly, we introduce the concept of representation-supported communication that is based on deriving representations from the argumentation with respect to target stakeholders and communication purposes. Finally, we demonstrate how this approach can be integrated into the system lifecycle to facilitate stakeholder communication.

Title: Low Overhead Channel Estimation in MIMO OTFS Wireless Communication Systems
Authors: Kailong Wang, Athina Petropulu
Abstract: Orthogonal Time Frequency Space (OTFS) modulation has recently garnered attention due to its robustness in high-mobility wireless communication environments. In OTFS, the data symbols are mapped to the Doppler-Delay (DD) domain. In this paper, we address bandwidth-efficient estimation of channel state information (CSI) for MIMO OTFS systems. Existing channel estimation techniques either require non-overlapped DD-domain pilots and associated guard regions across multiple antennas, sacrificing significant communication rate as the number of transmit antennas increases, or sophisticated algorithms to handle overlapped pilots, escalating the cost and complexity of receivers. We introduce a novel pilot-aided channel estimation method that enjoys low overhead while achieving high performance. Our approach embeds pilots within each OTFS burst in the Time-Frequency (TF) domain. We propose a novel use of TF and DD guard bins, aiming to preserve waveform orthogonality on the pilot bins and DD data integrity, respectively. The receiver first obtains low-complexity coarse estimates of the channel parameters. Leveraging the orthogonality, a virtual array (VA) is constructed. This enables the formulation of a sparse signal recovery (SSR) problem, in which the coarse estimates are used to build a low-dimensional dictionary matrix. The SSR solution yields high-resolution estimates of channel parameters. Simulation results show that the proposed approach achieves good performance with only a small number of pilots and guard bins. Furthermore, the required overhead is independent of the number of transmit antennas, ensuring good scalability of the proposed method for large MIMO arrays. The proposed approach considers practical rectangular transmit pulse-shaping and receiver matched filtering, and also accounts for fractional Doppler effects.

Title: MIMO Communications with 1-bit RIS: Asymptotic Analysis and Over-the-Air Channel Diagonalization
Authors: Panagiotis Gavriilidis, Kyriakos Stylianopoulos, George C. Alexandropoulos
Abstract: This paper presents an asymptotic analysis of Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) systems assisted by a 1-bit Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface (RIS) under Ricean fading conditions. Using random matrix theory, we show that, in the asymptotic regime, the dominant singular values and vectors of the transmitter-RIS and RIS-receiver channels converge to their deterministic Line-of-Sight (LoS) components, almost irrespective of the Ricean factors. This enables RIS phase configuration using only LoS information through a closed-form Sign Alignment (SA) rule that maximizes the channel gain. Furthermore, when the RIS is asymptotically larger than the transceiver arrays, proper RIS configuration can render the end-to-end MIMO channel in the capacity formula asymptotically diagonal, thereby eliminating inter-stream interference and enabling Over-The-Air (OTA) spatial multiplexing without channel knowledge at the transmitter. Building on this result, a waterfilling-inspired SA algorithm that allocates RIS elements to spatial streams, based on the asymptotic singular values and statistical channel parameters, is proposed. Simulation results validate the theoretical analyses, demonstrating that the proposed schemes achieve performance comparable to conventional Riemannian manifold optimization, but with orders of magnitude lower runtime.

Title: Nyquist Signaling Modulation (NSM): An FTN-Inspired Paradigm Shift in Modulation Design for 6G and Beyond
Authors: Mohamed Siala, Abdullah Al-Nafisah, Tareq Al-Naffouri
Abstract: Nyquist Signaling Modulations (NSMs) are a new signaling paradigm inspired by faster-than-Nyquist principles but based on a distinct approach that enables controlled inter-symbol interference through carefully designed finite-impulse-response filters. NSMs can operate in any number of dimensions, including mixed-dimensional configurations, offering wide flexibility in filter design, optional energy balancing, and preservation of the 2-ASK minimum squared Euclidean distance (MSED). Both real and rational tapped filters are investigated, and closed-form expressions are derived for the optimal real-tap filters in the one-dimensional case (MS-PRS), providing analytical insight and strong agreement with simulated bit-error behavior across wide SNR ranges. The paradigm is conceptually expanded through an analog Low-Density Generator Matrix (LDGM) formulation, which broadens the NSM family and unifies modulation and coding within a single, structurally coherent framework. When combined with LDPC coding, it enables efficient and naturally synergistic interaction between the analog modulation and the digital LDPC code. Alternatively, when analog LDGM is employed for both source coding and modulation, a simple and harmonious joint source-channel-modulation structure emerges. In both configurations, the constituent blocks exhibit dual graph-based architectures suited to message passing, achieving high flexibility and complexity-efficient operation. Collectively, these results establish promising physical-layer directions for future 6G communication systems.

Title: A bioreactor-based architecture for in vivo model-based and sim-to-real learning control of microbial consortium composition
Authors: Sara Maria Brancato, Davide Salzano, Davide Fiore, Francesco De Lellis, Giovanni Russo, Mario di Bernardo
Abstract: Microbial consortia offer significant biotechnological advantages over monocultures for bioproduction. However, industrial deployment is hampered by the lack of scalable architectures to ensure stable coexistence between populations. Existing strategies rely on genetic modifications, which impose metabolic load, or environmental changes, which can reduce production. We present a versatile control architecture to regulate density and composition of a two-strain consortium without genetic engineering or drastic environmental changes. Our bioreactor-based control architecture comprises a mixing chamber where both strains are co-cultured and a reservoir sustaining the slower-growing strain. For both chambers we develop model-based and sim-to-real learning controllers. The control architecture is then validated in vivo on a two-strain Escherichia coli consortium, achieving precise and robust regulation of consortium density and composition, including tracking of time-varying references and recovery from perturbations.

Title: The curse of dimensionality: what lies beyond the capabilities of physics-informed neural networks
Authors: J. Penuela, H. Ouerdane
Abstract: Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) have emerged as a promising framework for solving forward and inverse problems governed by differential equations. However, their reliability when used in ill-posed inverse problems remains poorly understood. In this study, we explore the fundamental limitations of PINNs using a simple illustrative case: RC low-pass filters. Showing that while PINNs can accurately predict system dynamics in forward problems, they fail to recover unique physical parameters when solving inverse problems when more than two parameters are approximated. Our findings provide grounds to understand the boundaries of PINNs applicability for parameter discovery in physical systems.

Title: Modulo Video Recovery via Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer
Authors: Tianyu Geng, Feng Ji, Wee Peng Tay
Abstract: Conventional image sensors have limited dynamic range, causing saturation in high-dynamic-range (HDR) scenes. Modulo cameras address this by folding incident irradiance into a bounded range, yet require specialized unwrapping algorithms to reconstruct the underlying signal. Unlike HDR recovery, which extends dynamic range from conventional sampling, modulo recovery restores actual values from folded samples. Despite being introduced over a decade ago, progress in modulo image recovery has been slow, especially in the use of modern deep learning techniques. In this work, we demonstrate that standard HDR methods are unsuitable for modulo recovery. Transformers, however, can capture global dependencies and spatial-temporal relationships crucial for resolving folded video frames. Still, adapting existing Transformer architectures for modulo recovery demands novel techniques. To this end, we present Selective Spatiotemporal Vision Transformer (SSViT), the first deep learning framework for modulo video reconstruction. SSViT employs a token selection strategy to improve efficiency and concentrate on the most critical regions. Experiments confirm that SSViT produces high-quality reconstructions from 8-bit folded videos and achieves state-of-the-art performance in modulo video recovery.

Title: Provably Efficient Sample Complexity for Robust CMDP
Authors: Sourav Ganguly, Arnob Ghosh
Abstract: We study the problem of learning policies that maximize cumulative reward while satisfying safety constraints, even when the real environment differs from a simulator or nominal model. We focus on robust constrained Markov decision processes (RCMDPs), where the agent must maximize reward while ensuring cumulative utility exceeds a threshold under the worst-case dynamics within an uncertainty set. While recent works have established finite-time iteration complexity guarantees for RCMDPs using policy optimization, their sample complexity guarantees remain largely unexplored. In this paper, we first show that Markovian policies may fail to be optimal even under rectangular uncertainty sets unlike the {\em unconstrained} robust MDP. To address this, we introduce an augmented state space that incorporates the remaining utility budget into the state representation. Building on this formulation, we propose a novel Robust constrained Value iteration (RCVI) algorithm with a sample complexity of $\mathcal{\tilde{O}}(|S||A|H^5/\epsilon^2)$ achieving at most $\epsilon$ violation using a generative model where $|S|$ and $|A|$ denote the sizes of the state and action spaces, respectively, and $H$ is the episode length. To the best of our knowledge, this is the {\em first sample complexity guarantee} for RCMDP. Empirical results further validate the effectiveness of our approach.

Authors: Brandon Dominique, Prudence Lam, Nicholas Kurtansky, Jochen Weber, Kivanc Kose, Veronica Rotemberg, Jennifer Dy
Abstract: Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have demonstrated expert-level performance in melanoma detection, yet their clinical adoption is hindered by performance disparities across demographic subgroups such as gender, race, and age. Previous efforts to benchmark the performance of AI models have primarily focused on assessing model performance using group fairness metrics that rely on the Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic curve (AUROC), which does not provide insights into a model's ability to provide accurate estimates. In line with clinical assessments, this paper addresses this gap by incorporating calibration as a complementary benchmarking metric to AUROC-based fairness metrics. Calibration evaluates the alignment between predicted probabilities and observed event rates, offering deeper insights into subgroup biases. We assess the performance of the leading skin cancer detection algorithm of the ISIC 2020 Challenge on the ISIC 2020 Challenge dataset and the PROVE-AI dataset, and compare it with the second and third place models, focusing on subgroups defined by sex, race (Fitzpatrick Skin Tone), and age. Our findings reveal that while existing models enhance discriminative accuracy, they often over-diagnose risk and exhibit calibration issues when applied to new datasets. This study underscores the necessity for comprehensive model auditing strategies and extensive metadata collection to achieve equitable AI-driven healthcare solutions.

Title: Geometric Conditions for Lossless Convexification in Fuel-Optimal Control of Linear Systems with Discrete-Valued Inputs
Authors: Felipe Arenas-Uribe, Hasan A. Poonawala, Jesse B. Hoagg
Abstract: Trajectory generation for autonomous systems with discrete-valued actuators is challenging due to the mixed-integer nature of the resulting optimization problems, which are generally intractable for real-time, safety-critical applications. Lossless convexification offers an alternative by reformulating mixed-integer programs as equivalent convex programs that can be solved efficiently with guaranteed convergence. This paper develops a lossless convexification framework for the fuel-optimal control of linear systems with discrete-valued inputs. We extend existing Mayer-form results by showing that, under simple geometric conditions, system normality is preserved when reformulating Lagrange-form problems into Mayer-form. Furthermore, we derive explicit algebraic conditions for normality in systems with cross-polytopic input sets. Leveraging these results and an extreme-point relaxation, we demonstrate that the fuel-optimal control problem admits a lossless convexification, enabling real-time, discrete-valued solutions without resorting to mixed-integer optimization. Numerical results from Monte Carlo simulations confirm that the proposed approach consistently yields discrete-valued control inputs with computation times compatible with real-time implementation.

Title: Global Optimization on Graph-Structured Data via Gaussian Processes with Spectral Representations
Authors: Shu Hong, Yongsheng Mei, Mahdi Imani, Tian Lan
Abstract: Bayesian optimization (BO) is a powerful framework for optimizing expensive black-box objectives, yet extending it to graph-structured domains remains challenging due to the discrete and combinatorial nature of graphs. Existing approaches often rely on either full graph topology-impractical for large or partially observed graphs-or incremental exploration, which can lead to slow convergence. We introduce a scalable framework for global optimization over graphs that employs low-rank spectral representations to build Gaussian process (GP) surrogates from sparse structural observations. The method jointly infers graph structure and node representations through learnable embeddings, enabling efficient global search and principled uncertainty estimation even with limited data. We also provide theoretical analysis establishing conditions for accurate recovery of underlying graph structure under different sampling regimes. Experiments on synthetic and real-world datasets demonstrate that our approach achieves faster convergence and improved optimization performance compared to prior methods.

Authors: Panpan Chen, Nader Motee, Qiyu Sun
Abstract: Nonlinear dynamical systems are widely encountered in various scientific and engineering fields. Despite significant advances in theoretical understanding, developing complete and integrated frameworks for analyzing and designing these systems remains challenging, which underscores the importance of efficient linearization methods. In this paper, we introduce a general linearization framework with emphasis on Carleman linearization and Carleman-Fourier linearization. A detailed case study on finite-section approximation to the lifted infinite-dimensional dynamical system is provided for the dynamical system with its governing function being a trigonometric polynomial of degree one.

Title: SONIC: Supersizing Motion Tracking for Natural Humanoid Whole-Body Control

Abstract: Despite the rise of billion-parameter foundation models trained across thousands of GPUs, similar scaling gains have not been shown for humanoid control. Current neural controllers for humanoids remain modest in size, target a limited behavior set, and are trained on a handful of GPUs over several days. We show that scaling up model capacity, data, and compute yields a generalist humanoid controller capable of creating natural and robust whole-body movements. Specifically, we posit motion tracking as a natural and scalable task for humanoid control, leverageing dense supervision from diverse motion-capture data to acquire human motion priors without manual reward engineering. We build a foundation model for motion tracking by scaling along three axes: network size (from 1.2M to 42M parameters), dataset volume (over 100M frames, 700 hours of high-quality motion data), and compute (9k GPU hours). Beyond demonstrating the benefits of scale, we show the practical utility of our model through two mechanisms: (1) a real-time universal kinematic planner that bridges motion tracking to downstream task execution, enabling natural and interactive control, and (2) a unified token space that supports various motion input interfaces, such as VR teleoperation devices, human videos, and vision-language-action (VLA) models, all using the same policy. Scaling motion tracking exhibits favorable properties: performance improves steadily with increased compute and data diversity, and learned representations generalize to unseen motions, establishing motion tracking at scale as a practical foundation for humanoid control.

Title: Occlusion-Aware Ground Target Search by a UAV in an Urban Environment
Authors: Collin Hague, Artur Wolek
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of searching for a point of interest (POI) moving along an urban road network with an uncrewed aerial vehicle (UAV). The UAV is modeled as a variable-speed Dubins vehicle with a line-of-sight sensor in an urban environment that may occlude the sensor's view of the POI. A search strategy is proposed that exploits a probabilistic visibility volume (VV) to plan its future motion with iterative deepening $A^\ast$. The probabilistic VV is a time-varying three-dimensional representation of the sensing constraints for a particular distribution of the POI's state. To find the path most likely to view the POI, the planner uses a heuristic to optimistically estimate the probability of viewing the POI over a time horizon. The probabilistic VV is max-pooled to create a variable-timestep planner that reduces the search space and balances long-term and short-term planning. The proposed path planning method is compared to prior work with a Monte-Carlo simulation and is shown to outperform the baseline methods in cluttered environments when the UAV's sensor has a higher false alarm probability.

Title: A Dual-Memory Ferroelectric Transistor Emulating Synaptic Metaplasticity for High-Speed Reservoir Computing
Authors: Yifan Wang, Muhammad Sakib Shahriar, Salma Soliman, Noah Vaillancourt, Lance Fernandes, Andrea Padovani, Asif Islam Khan, Md Sakib Hasan, Raisul Islam
Abstract: The exponential growth of edge artificial intelligence demands material-focused solutions to overcome energy consumption and latency limitations when processing real-time temporal data. Physical reservoir computing (PRC) offers an energy-efficient paradigm but faces challenges due to limited device scalability and reconfigurability. Additionally, reservoir and readout layers require memory of different timescales, short-term and long-term respectively - a material challenge hindering CMOS-compatible implementations. This work demonstrates a CMOS-compatible ferroelectric transistor using hafnium-zirconium-oxide (HZO) and silicon, enabling dual-memory operation. This system exhibits non-volatile long-term memory (LTM) from ferroelectric HZO polarization and volatile short-term memory (STM) from engineered non-quasi-static (NQS) channel-charge relaxation driven by gate-source/drain overlap capacitance. Ferroelectric polarization acts as non-volatile programming of volatile dynamics: by modulating threshold voltage, the ferroelectric state deterministically switches the NQS time constant and computational behavior between paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and depression (PPD). This establishes a generalizable material-design principle applicable to diverse ferroelectric-semiconductor heterostructures, extending beyond silicon to oxide semiconductors and heterogeneously-integrated systems. The device solves second-order nonlinear tasks with 3.69 x 10^-3 normalized error using only 16 reservoir states - ~5x reduction - achieving 20 us response time (~1000x faster) and 1.5 x 10^-7 J energy consumption, providing an immediately manufacturable pathway for neuromorphic hardware and energy-efficient edge intelligence.

Title: Algorithm-Relative Trajectory Valuation in Policy Gradient Control
Authors: Shihao Li, Jiachen Li, Jiamin Xu, Christopher Martin, Wei Li, Dongmei Chen
Abstract: We study how trajectory value depends on the learning algorithm in policy-gradient control. Using Trajectory Shapley in an uncertain LQR, we find a negative correlation between Persistence of Excitation (PE) and marginal value under vanilla REINFORCE ($r\approx-0.38$). We prove a variance-mediated mechanism: (i) for fixed energy, higher PE yields lower gradient variance; (ii) near saddles, higher variance increases escape probability, raising marginal contribution. When stabilized (state whitening or Fisher preconditioning), this variance channel is neutralized and information content dominates, flipping the correlation positive ($r\approx+0.29$). Hence, trajectory value is algorithm-relative. Experiments validate the mechanism and show decision-aligned scores (Leave-One-Out) complement Shapley for pruning, while Shapley identifies toxic subsets.

Title: Statistically Assuring Safety of Control Systems using Ensembles of Safety Filters and Conformal Prediction
Authors: Ihab Tabbara, Yuxuan Yang, Hussein Sibai
Abstract: Safety assurance is a fundamental requirement for deploying learning-enabled autonomous systems. Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis is a fundamental method for formally verifying safety and generating safe controllers. However, computing the HJ value function that characterizes the backward reachable set (BRS) of a set of user-defined failure states is computationally expensive, especially for high-dimensional systems, motivating the use of reinforcement learning approaches to approximate the value function. Unfortunately, a learned value function and its corresponding safe policy are not guaranteed to be correct. The learned value function evaluated at a given state may not be equal to the actual safety return achieved by following the learned safe policy. To address this challenge, we introduce a conformal prediction-based (CP) framework that bounds such uncertainty. We leverage CP to provide probabilistic safety guarantees when using learned HJ value functions and policies to prevent control systems from reaching failure states. Specifically, we use CP to calibrate the switching between the unsafe nominal controller and the learned HJ-based safe policy and to derive safety guarantees under this switched policy. We also investigate using an ensemble of independently trained HJ value functions as a safety filter and compare this ensemble approach to using individual value functions alone.

Title: Predict-then-Optimize Method for Seaport Power-Logistics Scheduling: Generalization across Varying Tasks Stream
Authors: Chuanqing Pu, Feilong Fan, Nengling Tai, Yan Xu, Wentao Huang, Honglin Wen
Abstract: Power-logistics scheduling in modern seaports typically follow a predict-then-optimize pipeline. To enhance decision quality, decision-focused learning has been proposed to align forecasting and optimization via end-to-end training. However, most formulations assume a fixed task configuration in downstream optimization, and thus generalize poorly to evolving task structures induced by varying seaport vessel arrivals. We address this gap with a decision-focused continual learning framework that adapts online to a stream of scheduling tasks. Specifically, we introduce Fisher information based regularization to enhance cross-task generalization by preserving parameters critical to prior tasks. A differentiable convex surrogate is also developed to stabilize gradient backpropagation. The proposed approach enables learning a decision-aligned forecasting model for new scheduling tasks while retaining generalization on earlier tasks. Experiments calibrated to the Jurong Port demonstrate superior decision performance and generalization over existing methods with reduced computational cost.

Title: A Two-Layer Electrostatic Film Actuator with High Actuation Stress and Integrated Brake
Authors: Huacen Wang, Hongqiang Wang
Abstract: Robotic systems driven by conventional motors often suffer from challenges such as large mass, complex control algorithms, and the need for additional braking mechanisms, which limit their applications in lightweight and compact robotic platforms. Electrostatic film actuators offer several advantages, including thinness, flexibility, lightweight construction, and high open-loop positioning accuracy. However, the actuation stress exhibited by conventional actuators in air still needs improvement, particularly for the widely used three-phase electrode design. To enhance the output performance of actuators, this paper presents a two-layer electrostatic film actuator with an integrated brake. By alternately distributing electrodes on both the top and bottom layers, a smaller effective electrode pitch is achieved under the same fabrication constraints, resulting in an actuation stress of approximately 241~N/m$^2$, representing a 90.5\% improvement over previous three-phase actuators operating in air. Furthermore, its integrated electrostatic adhesion mechanism enables load retention under braking mode. Several demonstrations, including a tug-of-war between a conventional single-layer actuator and the proposed two-layer actuator, a payload operation, a one-degree-of-freedom robotic arm, and a dual-mode gripper, were conducted to validate the actuator's advantageous capabilities in both actuation and braking modes.

Title: Model Predictive Control via Probabilistic Inference: A Tutorial
Authors: Kohei Honda
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) is a fundamental framework for optimizing robot behavior over a finite future horizon. While conventional numerical optimization methods can efficiently handle simple dynamics and cost structures, they often become intractable for the nonlinear or non-differentiable systems commonly encountered in robotics. This article provides a tutorial on probabilistic inference-based MPC, presenting a unified theoretical foundation and a comprehensive overview of representative methods. Probabilistic inference-based MPC approaches, such as Model Predictive Path Integral (MPPI) control, have gained significant attention by reinterpreting optimal control as a problem of probabilistic inference. Rather than relying on gradient-based numerical optimization, these methods estimate optimal control distributions through sampling-based techniques, accommodating arbitrary cost functions and dynamics. We first derive the optimal control distribution from the standard optimal control problem, elucidating its probabilistic interpretation and key characteristics. The widely used MPPI algorithm is then derived as a practical example, followed by discussions on prior and variational distribution design, tuning principles, and theoretical aspects. This article aims to serve as a systematic guide for researchers and practitioners seeking to understand, implement, and extend these methods in robotics and beyond.

In this short paper we celebrate Zhong-Ping Jiang's 60th birthday by studying a special class of families of interconnected systems: the so-called strings. We develop trajectory-based and Lyapunov-based tools that allow the verification of string stability to homogeneous bidirectional strings. The obtained results are applied to the problem of cruise controller design for a string of vehicles.

Title: Nash-equilibrium Seeking Algorithm for Power-Allocation Games on Networks of International Relations
Authors: Chuanzhe Zhang, Yuke Li, Wenjun Mei
Abstract: In the field of international security, understanding the strategic interactions between countries within a networked context is crucial. Our previous research has introduced a ``games-on-signed graphs'' framework~\cite{LiMorse2022} to analyze these interactions. While the framework is intended to be basic and general, there is much left to be explored, particularly in capturing the complexity of strategic scenarios in international relations. Our paper aims to fill this gap in two key ways. First, we modify the existing preference axioms to allow for a more nuanced understanding of how countries pursue self-survival, defense of allies, and offense toward adversaries. Second, we introduce a novel algorithm that proves the existence of a pure-strategy Nash equilibrium for these revised games. To validate our model, we employ historical data from the year 1940 as the game input and predict countries' survivability. Our contributions thus extend the real-world applicability of the original framework, offering a more comprehensive view of strategic interactions in a networked security environment.

Title: Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP: Macro Placement by Recursively Prototyping and Packing Tree-based Relocating
Authors: Yunqi Shi, Xi Lin, Zhiang Wang, Siyuan Xu, Shixiong Kai, Yao Lai, Chengrui Gao, Ke Xue, Mingxuan Yuan, Chao Qian, Zhi-Hua Zhou
Abstract: This work introduces the Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP method, which generates expert-quality macro placements through recursively prototyping and packing tree-based relocating. We first perform multi-level macro grouping and PPA-aware cell clustering to produce a unified connection matrix that captures both wirelength and dataflow among macros and clusters. Next, we use DREAMPlace to build a mixed-size placement prototype and obtain reference positions for each macro and cluster. Based on this prototype, we introduce ABPlace, an angle-based analytical method that optimizes macro positions on an ellipse to distribute macros uniformly near chip periphery, while optimizing wirelength and dataflow. A packing tree-based relocating procedure is then designed to jointly adjust the locations of macro groups and the macros within each group, by optimizing an expertise-inspired cost function that captures various design constraints through evolutionary search. Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP repeats the above process: Only a subset of macro groups are positioned in each iteration, and the remaining macros are deferred to the next iteration to improve the prototype's accuracy. Using a well-established backend flow with sufficient timing optimizations, Re$^{\text{2}}$MaP achieves up to 22.22% (average 10.26%) improvement in worst negative slack (WNS) and up to 97.91% (average 33.97%) improvement in total negative slack (TNS) compared to the state-of-the-art academic placer Hier-RTLMP. It also ranks higher on WNS, TNS, power, design rule check (DRC) violations, and runtime than the conference version ReMaP, across seven tested cases. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Information Capacity: Evaluating the Efficiency of Large Language Models via Text Compression
Authors: Cheng Yuan, Jiawei Shao, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Recent years have witnessed the rapid advancements of large language models (LLMs) and their expanding applications, leading to soaring demands for computational resources. The widespread adoption of test-time scaling further aggravates the tension between model capability and resource consumption, highlighting the importance of inference efficiency. However, a unified metric that accurately reflects an LLM's efficiency across different model sizes and architectures remains absent. Motivated by the correlation between compression and intelligence, we introduce information capacity, a measure of model efficiency based on text compression performance relative to computational complexity. Larger models can predict the next token more accurately, achieving greater compression gains but at higher computational costs. Empirical evaluations on mainstream open-source models show that models of varying sizes within a series exhibit consistent information capacity. This metric enables a fair efficiency comparison across model series and accurate performance prediction within a model series. A distinctive feature of information capacity is that it incorporates tokenizer efficiency, which affects both input and output token counts but is often neglected in LLM evaluations. We assess the information capacity of 49 models on 5 heterogeneous datasets and observe consistent results on the influences of tokenizer efficiency, pretraining data, and the mixture-of-experts architecture.

Title: Radar-APLANC: Unsupervised Radar-based Heartbeat Sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast
Authors: Ying Wang, Zhaodong Sun, Xu Cheng, Zuxian He, Xiaobai Li
Abstract: Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave (FMCW) radars can measure subtle chest wall oscillations to enable non-contact heartbeat sensing. However, traditional radar-based heartbeat sensing methods face performance degradation due to noise. Learning-based radar methods achieve better noise robustness but require costly labeled signals for supervised training. To overcome these limitations, we propose the first unsupervised framework for radar-based heartbeat sensing via Augmented Pseudo-Label and Noise Contrast (Radar-APLANC). We propose to use both the heartbeat range and noise range within the radar range matrix to construct the positive and negative samples, respectively, for improved noise robustness. Our Noise-Contrastive Triplet (NCT) loss only utilizes positive samples, negative samples, and pseudo-label signals generated by the traditional radar method, thereby avoiding dependence on expensive ground-truth physiological signals. We further design a pseudo-label augmentation approach featuring adaptive noise-aware label selection to improve pseudo-label signal quality. Extensive experiments on the Equipleth dataset and our collected radar dataset demonstrate that our unsupervised method achieves performance comparable to state-of-the-art supervised methods. Our code, dataset, and supplementary materials can be accessed from this https URL.

Title: Dynamic Downlink-Uplink Spectrum Sharing between Terrestrial and Non-Terrestrial Networks
Authors: Sourav Mukherjee, Bho Matthiesen, Armin Dekorsy, Petar Popovski
Abstract: 6G networks are expected to integrate low Earth orbit satellites to ensure global connectivity by extending coverage to underserved and remote regions. However, the deployment of dense mega-constellations introduces severe interference among satellites operating over shared frequency bands. This is, in part, due to the limited flexibility of conventional frequency division duplex (FDD) systems, where fixed bands for downlink (DL) and uplink (UL) transmissions are employed. In this work, we propose dynamic re-assignment of FDD bands for improved interference management in dense deployments and evaluate the performance gain of this approach. To this end, we formulate a joint optimization problem that incorporates dynamic band assignment, user scheduling, and power allocation in both directions. This non-convex mixed integer problem is solved using a combination of equivalence transforms, alternating optimization, and state-of-the-art industrial-grade mixed integer solvers. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed approach of dynamic FDD band assignment significantly enhances system performance over conventional FDD, achieving up to 94\% improvement in throughput in dense deployments.

Title: Melodia: Training-Free Music Editing Guided by Attention Probing in Diffusion Models
Authors: Yi Yang, Haowen Li, Tianxiang Li, Boyu Cao, Xiaohan Zhang, Liqun Chen, Qi Liu
Abstract: Text-to-music generation technology is progressing rapidly, creating new opportunities for musical composition and editing. However, existing music editing methods often fail to preserve the source music's temporal structure, including melody and rhythm, when altering particular attributes like instrument, genre, and mood. To address this challenge, this paper conducts an in-depth probing analysis on attention maps within AudioLDM 2, a diffusion-based model commonly used as the backbone for existing music editing methods. We reveal a key finding: cross-attention maps encompass details regarding distinct musical characteristics, and interventions on these maps frequently result in ineffective modifications. In contrast, self-attention maps are essential for preserving the temporal structure of the source music during its conversion into the target music. Building upon this understanding, we present Melodia, a training-free technique that selectively manipulates self-attention maps in particular layers during the denoising process and leverages an attention repository to store source music information, achieving accurate modification of musical characteristics while preserving the original structure without requiring textual descriptions of the source music. Additionally, we propose two novel metrics to better evaluate music editing methods. Both objective and subjective experiments demonstrate that our approach achieves superior results in terms of textual adherence and structural integrity across various datasets. This research enhances comprehension of internal mechanisms within music generation models and provides improved control for music creation.

Title: RAPTR: Radar-based 3D Pose Estimation using Transformer
Authors: Sorachi Kato, Ryoma Yataka, Pu Perry Wang, Pedro Miraldo, Takuya Fujihashi, Petros Boufounos
Abstract: Radar-based indoor 3D human pose estimation typically relied on fine-grained 3D keypoint labels, which are costly to obtain especially in complex indoor settings involving clutter, occlusions, or multiple people. In this paper, we propose \textbf{RAPTR} (RAdar Pose esTimation using tRansformer) under weak supervision, using only 3D BBox and 2D keypoint labels which are considerably easier and more scalable to collect. Our RAPTR is characterized by a two-stage pose decoder architecture with a pseudo-3D deformable attention to enhance (pose/joint) queries with multi-view radar features: a pose decoder estimates initial 3D poses with a 3D template loss designed to utilize the 3D BBox labels and mitigate depth ambiguities; and a joint decoder refines the initial poses with 2D keypoint labels and a 3D gravity loss. Evaluated on two indoor radar datasets, RAPTR outperforms existing methods, reducing joint position error by $34.3\%$ on HIBER and $76.9\%$ on MMVR. Our implementation is available at this https URL.

Title: HardFlow: Hard-Constrained Sampling for Flow-Matching Models via Trajectory Optimization
Authors: Zeyang Li, Kaveh Alim, Navid Azizan
Abstract: Diffusion and flow-matching have emerged as powerful methodologies for generative modeling, with remarkable success in capturing complex data distributions and enabling flexible guidance at inference time. Many downstream applications, however, demand enforcing hard constraints on generated samples (for example, robot trajectories must avoid obstacles), a requirement that goes beyond simple guidance. Prevailing projection-based approaches constrain the entire sampling path to the constraint manifold, which is overly restrictive and degrades sample quality. In this paper, we introduce a novel framework that reformulates hard-constrained sampling as a trajectory optimization problem. Our key insight is to leverage numerical optimal control to steer the sampling trajectory so that constraints are satisfied precisely at the terminal time. By exploiting the underlying structure of flow-matching models and adopting techniques from model predictive control, we transform this otherwise complex constrained optimization problem into a tractable surrogate that can be solved efficiently and effectively. Furthermore, this trajectory optimization perspective offers significant flexibility beyond mere constraint satisfaction, allowing for the inclusion of integral costs to minimize distribution shift and terminal objectives to further enhance sample quality, all within a unified framework. We provide a control-theoretic analysis of our method, establishing bounds on the approximation error between our tractable surrogate and the ideal formulation. Extensive experiments across diverse domains, including robotics (planning), partial differential equations (boundary control), and vision (text-guided image editing), demonstrate that our algorithm, which we name $\textit{HardFlow}$, substantially outperforms existing methods in both constraint satisfaction and sample quality.

Title: Understanding Electro-communication and Electro-sensing in Weakly Electric Fish using Multi-Agent Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Satpreet H. Singh, Sonja Johnson-Yu, Zhouyang Lu, Aaron Walsman, Federico Pedraja, Denis Turcu, Pratyusha Sharma, Naomi Saphra, Nathaniel B. Sawtell, Kanaka Rajan
Abstract: Weakly electric fish, like Gnathonemus petersii, use a remarkable electrical modality for active sensing and communication, but studying their rich electrosensing and electrocommunication behavior and associated neural activity in naturalistic settings remains experimentally challenging. Here, we present a novel biologically-inspired computational framework to study these behaviors, where recurrent neural network (RNN) based artificial agents trained via multi-agent reinforcement learning (MARL) learn to modulate their electric organ discharges (EODs) and movement patterns to collectively forage in virtual environments. Trained agents demonstrate several emergent features consistent with real fish collectives, including heavy tailed EOD interval distributions, environmental context dependent shifts in EOD interval distributions, and social interaction patterns like freeloading, where agents reduce their EOD rates while benefiting from neighboring agents' active sensing. A minimal two-fish assay further isolates the role of electro-communication, showing that access to conspecific EODs and relative dominance jointly shape foraging success. Notably, these behaviors emerge through evolution-inspired rewards for individual fitness and emergent inter-agent interactions, rather than through rewarding agents explicitly for social interactions. Our work has broad implications for the neuroethology of weakly electric fish, as well as other social, communicating animals in which extensive recordings from multiple individuals, and thus traditional data-driven modeling, are infeasible.

Title: Solving Quadratic Programs with Slack Variables via ADMM without Increasing the Problem Size
Authors: Thomas Lew, Marcus Greiff, John Subosits, Brian Plancher
Abstract: Proximal methods such as the Alternating Direction Method of Multipliers (ADMM) are effective at solving constrained quadratic programs (QPs). To tackle infeasible QPs, slack variables are often introduced to ensure feasibility, which changes the structure of the problem, increases its size, and slows down numerical resolution. In this letter, we propose a simple ADMM scheme to tackle QPs with slack variables without increasing the size of the original problem. The only modification is a slightly different projection in the z-update, while the rest of the algorithm remains standard. We prove that the method is equivalent to applying ADMM to the QP with additional slack variables, even though slack variables are not added. Numerical experiments show speedups of the approach.

Title: Spatio-Temporal Cluster-Triggered Encoding for Spiking Neural Networks
Authors: Lingyun Ke, Minchi Hu
Abstract: Encoding static images into spike trains is a crucial step for enabling Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) to process visual information efficiently. However, existing schemes such as rate coding, Poisson encoding, and time-to-first-spike (TTFS) often ignore spatial relationships and yield temporally inconsistent spike patterns. In this article, a novel cluster-based encoding approach is proposed, which leverages local density computation to preserve semantic structure in both spatial and temporal domains. This method introduces a 2D spatial cluster trigger that identifies foreground regions through connected component analysis and local density estimation. Then, extend to a 3D spatio-temporal (ST3D) framework that jointly considers temporal neighborhoods, producing spike trains with improved temporal consistency. Experiments on the N-MNIST dataset demonstrate that our ST3D encoder achieves 98.17% classification accuracy with a simple single-layer SNN, outperforming standard TTFS encoding (97.58%) and matching the performance of more complex deep architectures while using significantly fewer spikes (~3800 vs ~5000 per sample). The results demonstrate that this approach provides an interpretable and efficient encoding strategy for neuromorphic computing applications.

Title: HQ-SVC: Towards High-Quality Zero-Shot Singing Voice Conversion in Low-Resource Scenarios
Authors: Bingsong Bai, Yizhong Geng, Fengping Wang, Cong Wang, Puyuan Guo, Yingming Gao, Ya Li
Abstract: Zero-shot singing voice conversion (SVC) transforms a source singer's timbre to an unseen target speaker's voice while preserving melodic content without fine-tuning. Existing methods model speaker timbre and vocal content separately, losing essential acoustic information that degrades output quality while requiring significant computational resources. To overcome these limitations, we propose HQ-SVC, an efficient framework for high-quality zero-shot SVC. HQ-SVC first extracts jointly content and speaker features using a decoupled codec. It then enhances fidelity through pitch and volume modeling, preserving critical acoustic information typically lost in separate modeling approaches, and progressively refines outputs via differentiable signal processing and diffusion techniques. Evaluations confirm HQ-SVC significantly outperforms state-of-the-art zero-shot SVC methods in conversion quality and efficiency. Beyond voice conversion, HQ-SVC achieves superior voice naturalness compared to specialized audio super-resolution methods while natively supporting voice super-resolution tasks.

Title: Safe and Optimal Learning from Preferences via Weighted Temporal Logic with Applications in Robotics and Formula 1
Authors: Ruya Karagulle, Cristian-Ioan Vasile, Necmiye Ozay
Abstract: Autonomous systems increasingly rely on human feedback to align their behavior, expressed as pairwise comparisons, rankings, or demonstrations. While existing methods can adapt behaviors, they often fail to guarantee safety in safety-critical domains. We propose a safety-guaranteed, optimal, and efficient approach to solve the learning problem from preferences, rankings, or demonstrations using Weighted Signal Temporal Logic (WSTL). WSTL learning problems, when implemented naively, lead to multi-linear constraints in the weights to be learned. By introducing structural pruning and log-transform procedures, we reduce the problem size and recast the problem as a Mixed-Integer Linear Program while preserving safety guarantees. Experiments on robotic navigation and real-world Formula 1 data demonstrate that the method effectively captures nuanced preferences and models complex task objectives.

Title: Lyapunov-Krasovskii Functionals of Robust Type for the Stability Analysis in Time-Delay Systems
Authors: Tessina H. Scholl
Abstract: Inspired by the widespread concept of Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of complete type, this article proposes an alternative class of functionals, termed Lyapunov-Krasovskii functionals of robust type. Their construction aims at improving deducible robustness bounds of linear systems with a constant delay. These refer to bounds on nonlinear or uncertain terms that can be added to the system without compromising the proof of stability. The defining equation of complete-type functionals relies on the template of a Lyapunov equation. In contrast, the proposed functionals are related to an algebraic Riccati equation. The article proves properties that make these functionals suitable tools for the stability analysis via Lyapunov arguments. The derived linear bounds on the norm of admissible perturbations mirror bounds from the small gain theorem or the complex stability radius. More general sector-based absolute stability bounds can also be addressed. Existence of the functionals is proven via the Kalman-Yakubovich-Popov lemma combined with a splitting approach. In particular, for any asymptotically stable nominal system, there exists a Lyapunov-Krasovskii functional of robust type that proves a nonzero bound on admissible perturbations. This robustness bound significantly improves results from complete-type functionals.

Title: Disturbance-Adaptive Data-Driven Predictive Control: Trading Comfort Violations for Savings in Building Climate Control
Authors: Jicheng Shi, Christophe Salzmann, Colin N. Jones
Abstract: Model Predictive Control (MPC) has demonstrated significant potential in improving energy efficiency in building climate control, outperforming traditional controllers commonly used in modern building management systems. Among MPC variants, Data-driven Predictive Control (DPC) offers the advantage of modeling building dynamics directly from data, thereby substantially reducing commissioning efforts. However, inevitable model uncertainties and measurement noise can result in comfort violations, even with dedicated MPC setups. This paper introduces a Disturbance-Adaptive DPC (DAD-DPC) framework that ensures asymptotic satisfaction of predefined violation bounds without knowing the uncertainty and noise distributions. The framework employs a data-driven pipeline based on Willems' Fundamental Lemma and conformal prediction for application in building climate control. The proposed DAD-DPC framework was validated through four building cases using the high-fidelity BOPTEST simulation platform and an occupied campus building, Polydome. DAD-DPC successfully regulated the average comfort violations to meet pre-defined bounds. Notably, the 5%-violation DAD-DPC setup achieved 30.1%/11.2%/27.1%/20.5% energy savings compared to default controllers across four cases. These results demonstrate the framework's effectiveness in balancing energy consumption and comfort violations, offering a practical solution for building climate control applications.

Title: Joint Attention Mechanism Learning to Facilitate Opto-physiological Monitoring during Physical Activity
Authors: Xiaoyu Zheng, Sijung Hu, Vincent Dwyer, Mahsa Derakhshani, Laura Barrett
Abstract: Opto-physiological monitoring including photoplethysmography (PPG) provides non-invasive cardiac and respiratory measurements, yet motion artefacts (MAs) during physical activity degrade its signal quality and downstream estimation concurrently. An attention-mechanism-based generative adversarial network (AM-GAN) was proposed to model motion artefacts and mitigate their impact on raw PPG signals. The AM-GAN learns how to transform motion-affected PPG into artefact-reduced waveforms to align with triaxial acceleration signals corresponding to artefact components gained from a triaxial accelerometer. The AM-GAN has been validated across four experimental protocols with 43 participants performing activities from low to high intensity (6--12km/h). With the public datasets, the AM-GAN achieves mean absolute error (MAE) for heart rate (HR) of 1.81 beats/min on IEEE-SPC and 3.86 beats/min on PPGDalia. On the in-house LU dataset, it shows the MAEs < 1.37 beats/min for HR and 2.49 breaths/min for respiratory rate (RR). A further in-house C2 dataset with three oxygen levels (16%, 18%, and 21%) was applied in the AM-GAN to attain a MAE of 1.65% for SpO2. The outcome demonstrates that the AM-GAN offers a robust and reliable physiological estimation under various intensities of physical activity.

Title: Path planning with moving obstacles using stochastic optimal control
Authors: Seyyed Reza Jafari (1), Anders Hansson (1), Bo Wahlberg (2) ((1) Linköping University, Linköping, Sweden, (2) KTH Royal Institute of Technology, Stockholm, Sweden)
Abstract: Navigating a collision-free, optimal path for a robot poses a perpetual challenge, particularly in the presence of moving objects such as humans. In this study, we formulate the problem of finding an optimal path as a stochastic optimal control problem. However, obtaining a solution to this problem is nontrivial. Therefore, we consider a simplified problem, which is more tractable. For this simplified formulation, we are able to solve the corresponding Bellman equation. However, the solution obtained from the simplified problem does not sufficiently address the original problem of interest. To address the full problem, we propose a numerical procedure where we solve an optimization problem at each sampling instant. The solution to the simplified problem is integrated into the online formulation as a final-state penalty. We illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method using a numerical example.

Title: A Novel Online Pseudospectral Method for Approximation of Nonlinear Systems Dynamics
Authors: Arian Yousefian, Avimanyu Sahoo, Vignesh Narayanan
Abstract: This note presents an online pseudospectral method for system identification using Chebyshev polynomial basis under aperiodic sampling. The system dynamics are approximated piecewise by introducing a sliding time window. The number of sampling instants (Chebyshev nodes) within each sliding window is selected dynamically based on a proposed node-selection criterion that guarantees desired approximation accuracy. The system states are measured at these aperiodic instants and used to estimate the coefficients of the basis polynomials using least squares. An adaptive state estimator is also proposed to reconstruct the continuous states using the approximated dynamics. The boundedness of the parameter and state estimation errors is proven analytically and validated numerically.

Title: Targeted Unlearning Using Perturbed Sign Gradient Methods With Applications On Medical Images
Authors: George R. Nahass, Zhu Wang, Homa Rashidisabet, Won Hwa Kim, Sasha Hubschman, Jeffrey C. Peterson, Chad A. Purnell, Pete Setabutr, Ann Q. Tran, Darvin Yi, Sathya N. Ravi
Abstract: Machine unlearning aims to remove the influence of specific training samples from a trained model without full retraining. While prior work has largely focused on privacy-motivated settings, we recast unlearning as a general-purpose tool for post-deployment model revision. Specifically, we focus on utilizing unlearning in clinical contexts where data shifts, device deprecation, and policy changes are common. To this end, we propose a bilevel optimization formulation of boundary-based unlearning that can be solved using iterative algorithms. We provide convergence guarantees when first-order algorithms are used to unlearn. Our method introduces tunable loss design for controlling the forgetting-retention tradeoff and supports novel model composition strategies that merge the strengths of distinct unlearning runs. Across benchmark and real-world clinical imaging datasets, our approach outperforms baselines on both forgetting and retention metrics, including scenarios involving imaging devices and anatomical outliers. This work establishes machine unlearning as a modular, practical alternative to retraining for real-world model maintenance in clinical applications.

Title: On hallucinations in AI-generated content for nuclear medicine imaging (the DREAM report)
Authors: Menghua Xia, Reimund Bayerlein, Yanis Chemli, Xiaofeng Liu, Jinsong Ouyang, MingDe Lin, Georges El Fakhri, Ramsey D. Badawi, Quanzheng Li, Chi Liu
Abstract: Artificial intelligence-generated content (AIGC) has shown remarkable performance in nuclear medicine imaging (NMI), offering cost-effective software solutions for tasks such as image enhancement, motion correction, and attenuation correction. However, these advancements come with the risk of hallucinations, generating realistic yet factually incorrect content. Hallucinations can misrepresent anatomical and functional information, compromising diagnostic accuracy and clinical trust. This paper presents a comprehensive perspective of hallucination-related challenges in AIGC for NMI, introducing the DREAM report, which covers recommendations for definition, representative examples, detection and evaluation metrics, underlying causes, and mitigation strategies. This position statement paper aims to initiate a common understanding for discussions and future research toward enhancing AIGC applications in NMI, thereby supporting their safe and effective deployment in clinical practice.

Title: Filling of incomplete sinograms from sparse PET detector configurations using a residual U-Net
Authors: Klara Leffler, Luigi Tommaso Luppino, Samuel Kuttner, Karin Söderkvist, Jan Axelsson
Abstract: Long axial field-of-view PET scanners offer increased field-of-view and sensitivity compared to traditional PET scanners. However, a significant cost is associated with the densely packed photodetectors required for the extended-coverage systems, limiting clinical utilisation. To mitigate the cost limitations, alternative sparse system configurations have been proposed, allowing an extended field-of-view PET design with detector costs similar to a standard PET system, albeit at the expense of image quality. In this work, we propose a deep sinogram restoration network to fill in the missing sinogram data. Our method utilises a modified Residual U-Net, trained on clinical PET scans from a GE Signa PET/MR, simulating the removal of 50% of the detectors in a chessboard pattern (retaining only 25% of all lines of response). The model successfully recovers missing counts, with a mean absolute error below two events per pixel, outperforming 2D interpolation in both sinogram and reconstructed image domain. Notably, the predicted sinograms exhibit a smoothing effect, leading to reconstructed images lacking sharpness in finer details. Despite these limitations, the model demonstrates a substantial capacity for compensating for the undersampling caused by the sparse detector configuration. This proof-of-concept study suggests that sparse detector configurations, combined with deep learning techniques, offer a viable alternative to conventional PET scanner designs. This approach supports the development of cost-effective, total body PET scanners, allowing a significant step forward in medical imaging technology.

Title: Multi-Symbol Digital AirComp via Modulation Design and Power Adaptation
Authors: Xiaojing Yan, Saeed Razavikia, Carlo Fischione
Abstract: Recently, over-the-air computation (AirComp) leverages the superposition property of wireless channels to enable efficient function computation over a multiple access channel (MAC). However, existing digital AirComp methods either rely on single-symbol modulation, which limits flexibility and robustness, or on multi-symbol extensions that suffer from high complexity or approximation errors. To overcome these limitations, we propose a new multi-symbol modulation framework, termed sequential modulation for AirComp (SeMAC), which encodes each input into a sequence of symbols with distinct constellation diagrams across multiple time slots. This approach increases design flexibility and robustness against channel noise. Specifically, the modulation design is formulated as a non-convex optimization problem and efficiently solved through a successive convex approximation (SCA) combined with stochastic subgradient descent (SSD). For fixed modulation formats, we further develop SeMAC with power adaptation (SeMAC-PA) to adjusts transmit power and phase while preserving the modulation structure. Notably, numerical results show that SeMAC improves computation accuracy by up to 14 dB compared to the existing methods for computing nonlinear functions such as the product function.

Title: CoCoLIT: ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation for MRI to Amyloid PET Synthesis
Authors: Alec Sargood, Lemuel Puglisi, James H. Cole, Neil P. Oxtoby, Daniele Ravì, Daniel C. Alexander
Abstract: Synthesizing amyloid PET scans from the more widely available and accessible structural MRI modality offers a promising, cost-effective approach for large-scale Alzheimer's Disease (AD) screening. This is motivated by evidence that, while MRI does not directly detect amyloid pathology, it may nonetheless encode information correlated with amyloid deposition that can be uncovered through advanced modeling. However, the high dimensionality and structural complexity of 3D neuroimaging data pose significant challenges for existing MRI-to-PET translation methods. Modeling the cross-modality relationship in a lower-dimensional latent space can simplify the learning task and enable more effective translation. As such, we present CoCoLIT (ControlNet-Conditioned Latent Image Translation), a diffusion-based latent generative framework that incorporates three main innovations: (1) a novel Weighted Image Space Loss (WISL) that improves latent representation learning and synthesis quality; (2) a theoretical and empirical analysis of Latent Average Stabilization (LAS), an existing technique used in similar generative models to enhance inference consistency; and (3) the introduction of ControlNet-based conditioning for MRI-to-PET translation. We evaluate CoCoLIT's performance on publicly available datasets and find that our model significantly outperforms state-of-the-art methods on both image-based and amyloid-related metrics. Notably, in amyloid-positivity classification, CoCoLIT outperforms the second-best method with improvements of +10.5% on the internal dataset and +23.7% on the external dataset. The code and models of our approach are available at this https URL.

Title: py360tool: Um framework para manipulação de vídeo 360$^\circ$ com ladrilhos
Authors: Henrique Domingues Garcia, Marcelo Menezes de Carvalho
Abstract: The streaming of 360$^\circ$ videos is one of the most bandwidth-demanding virtual reality (VR) applications, as the video must be encoded in ultra-high resolution to ensure an immersive experience. To optimize its transmission, current approaches partition the spherical video into tiles, which are encoded at different bitrates and selectively delivered, based on the viewing direction of the user (viewport). The complexity of this architecture, which involves viewport prediction, tile selection, bit rate adaptation, and handling of parallel streaming, requires new tools to evaluate quality of experience (QoE) and quality of service (QoS), especially due to its interactive nature and low reproducibility. This work introduces py360tools, a Python library to handle tile-based 360$^\circ$ video streaming. The library automates key client-side tasks, such as spherical projection reconstruction, viewport extraction, and tile selection, facilitating the playback and simulation of streaming sessions. Furthermore, py360tools offers a flexible architecture, enabling efficient analysis of different projections and tiling strategies.

Title: HyDeFuse: Provably Convergent Denoiser-Driven Hyperspectral Fusion
Authors: Sagar Kumar, Unni V S, Kunal Narayan Chaudhury
Abstract: Hyperspectral (HS) images provide fine spectral resolution but have limited spatial resolution, whereas multispectral (MS) images capture finer spatial details but have fewer bands. HS-MS fusion aims to integrate HS and MS images to generate a single image with improved spatial and spectral resolution. This is commonly formulated as an inverse problem with a linear forward model. However, reconstructing high-quality images using the forward model alone is challenging, necessitating the use of regularization techniques. In this work, we investigate the paradigm of denoiser-driven regularization, where a powerful off-the-shelf denoiser is used for implicit regularization within an iterative algorithm. This has shown much promise but remains relatively underexplored in hyperspectral imaging. The technical challenge lies in designing hyperspectral denoisers that can guarantee convergence while strong denoisers can produce high-quality reconstructions, they may also cause instability or divergence. Specifically, we consider a denoiser-driven fusion algorithm, HyDeFuse, which leverages a class of pseudo-linear denoisers for implicit regularization. We demonstrate how the contraction mapping theorem can be applied to establish global linear convergence of HyDeFUse. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings and present fusion results on publicly available datasets to demonstrate the performance of HyDeFuse.

Title: Say More with Less: Variable-Frame-Rate Speech Tokenization via Adaptive Clustering and Implicit Duration Coding
Authors: Rui-Chen Zheng, Wenrui Liu, Hui-Peng Du, Qinglin Zhang, Chong Deng, Qian Chen, Wen Wang, Yang Ai, Zhen-Hua Ling
Abstract: Existing speech tokenizers typically assign a fixed number of tokens per second, regardless of the varying information density or temporal fluctuations in the speech signal. This uniform token allocation mismatches the intrinsic structure of speech, where information is distributed unevenly over time. To address this, we propose VARSTok, a VAriable-frame-Rate Speech Tokenizer that adapts token allocation based on local feature similarity. VARSTok introduces two key innovations: (1) a temporal-aware density peak clustering algorithm that adaptively segments speech into variable-length units, and (2) a novel implicit duration coding scheme that embeds both content and temporal span into a single token index, eliminating the need for auxiliary duration predictors. Extensive experiments show that VARSTok significantly outperforms strong fixed-rate baselines. Notably, it achieves superior reconstruction naturalness while using up to 23% fewer tokens than a 40 Hz fixed-frame-rate baseline. VARSTok further yields lower word error rates and improved naturalness in zero-shot text-to-speech synthesis. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to demonstrate that a fully dynamic, variable-frame-rate acoustic speech tokenizer can be seamlessly integrated into downstream speech language models.

Title: Short Blocks, Fast Sensing: Finite Blocklength Tradeoffs in RIS-Assisted ISAC
Authors: Adam Umra, Kevin Weinberger, Aymen Khaleel, Gerald Enzner, Aydin Sezgin
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is a cornerstone for future sixth-generation (6G) networks, enabling simultaneous connectivity and environmental awareness. However, practical realization faces significant challenges, including residual self-interference (SI) in full-duplex systems and performance degradation of short-packet transmissions under finite blocklength (FBL) constraints. This work studies a reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-assisted full-duplex ISAC system serving multiple downlink users while tracking a moving target, explicitly accounting for SI and FBL effects in both communication and sensing. We formulate an optimization framework to minimize service adaptation gaps while ensuring sensing reliability, solved via alternating optimization and successive convex approximation. Numerical results show that short blocklengths enable fast adaptation but raise radar outage from fewer pulses and motion sensitivity. Longer blocklengths improve signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) and reduce outages but allow motion to degrade sensing. A "sweet spot" arises where blocklength and beamformer allocation optimize throughput and sensing, seen as a local minimum in radar SINR variance. RIS-assisted optimization identifies this balance, achieving reliable communication and radar sensing jointly.

Title: Well-Designed k-Space Coverage is Important for Good MRI Denoising
Authors: Jiayang Wang, Justin P. Haldar
Abstract: Object: Modern computational MRI denoising approaches are often designed assuming fixed k-space coverage. This contrasts with earlier acquisition-design literature that leveraged k-space coverage modifications (e.g., reducing spatial resolution) to improve SNR. This work investigates whether the performance of modern computational denoising methods can be further enhanced by k-space coverage modifications. Materials and Methods: Using realistic simulations of noisy data, k-space coverage and averaging patterns were optimized for two advanced image denoising/reconstruction approaches: parallel imaging with total variation regularization and a U-Net neural network. For reference, comparisons against classical linear filtering/apodization methods were also performed. Performance was quantified using normalized root-mean-squared error (NRMSE) and structural similarity (SSIM) metrics. Results: Advanced computational denoising methods can be substantially enhanced, both quantitatively and qualitatively, by reducing the spatial resolution of the acquisition to improve SNR. Indeed, even simple linear filtering/apodization with optimized k-space coverage can rival advanced methods using naive higher-resolution coverage. Discussion: Classical acquisition design principles that allow spatial resolution to be traded for SNR enhancement are still very relevant for modern computational denoising techniques. However, the optimization of k-space coverage and denoising/reconstruction methods can also be somewhat confounded because the NRMSE and SSIM metrics have low sensitivity to spatial resolution.

Title: Zero-Shot Function Encoder-Based Differentiable Predictive Control
Authors: Hassan Iqbal, Xingjian Li, Tyler Ingebrand, Adam Thorpe, Krishna Kumar, Ufuk Topcu, Ján Drgoňa
Abstract: We introduce a differentiable framework for zero-shot adaptive control over parametric families of nonlinear dynamical systems. Our approach integrates a function encoder-based neural ODE (FE-NODE) for modeling system dynamics with a differentiable predictive control (DPC) for offline self-supervised learning of explicit control policies. The FE-NODE captures nonlinear behaviors in state transitions and enables zero-shot adaptation to new systems without retraining, while the DPC efficiently learns control policies across system parameterizations, thus eliminating costly online optimization common in classical model predictive control. We demonstrate the efficiency, accuracy, and online adaptability of the proposed method across a range of nonlinear systems with varying parametric scenarios, highlighting its potential as a general-purpose tool for fast zero-shot adaptive control.

Title: HarmoQ: Harmonized Post-Training Quantization for High-Fidelity Image
Authors: Hongjun Wang, Jiyuan Chen, Xuan Song, Yinqiang Zheng
Abstract: Post-training quantization offers an efficient pathway to deploy super-resolution models, yet existing methods treat weight and activation quantization independently, missing their critical interplay. Through controlled experiments on SwinIR, we uncover a striking asymmetry: weight quantization primarily degrades structural similarity, while activation quantization disproportionately affects pixel-level accuracy. This stems from their distinct roles--weights encode learned restoration priors for textures and edges, whereas activations carry input-specific intensity information. Building on this insight, we propose HarmoQ, a unified framework that harmonizes quantization across components through three synergistic steps: structural residual calibration proactively adjusts weights to compensate for activation-induced detail loss, harmonized scale optimization analytically balances quantization difficulty via closed-form solutions, and adaptive boundary refinement iteratively maintains this balance during optimization. Experiments show HarmoQ achieves substantial gains under aggressive compression, outperforming prior art by 0.46 dB on Set5 at 2-bit while delivering 3.2x speedup and 4x memory reduction on A100 GPUs. This work provides the first systematic analysis of weight-activation coupling in super-resolution quantization and establishes a principled solution for efficient high-quality image restoration.

Title: EndoIR: Degradation-Agnostic All-in-One Endoscopic Image Restoration via Noise-Aware Routing Diffusion
Authors: Tong Chen, Xinyu Ma, Long Bai, Wenyang Wang, Yue Sun, Luping Zhou
Abstract: Endoscopic images often suffer from diverse and co-occurring degradations such as low lighting, smoke, and bleeding, which obscure critical clinical details. Existing restoration methods are typically task-specific and often require prior knowledge of the degradation type, limiting their robustness in real-world clinical use. We propose EndoIR, an all-in-one, degradation-agnostic diffusion-based framework that restores multiple degradation types using a single model. EndoIR introduces a Dual-Domain Prompter that extracts joint spatial-frequency features, coupled with an adaptive embedding that encodes both shared and task-specific cues as conditioning for denoising. To mitigate feature confusion in conventional concatenation-based conditioning, we design a Dual-Stream Diffusion architecture that processes clean and degraded inputs separately, with a Rectified Fusion Block integrating them in a structured, degradation-aware manner. Furthermore, Noise-Aware Routing Block improves efficiency by dynamically selecting only noise-relevant features during denoising. Experiments on SegSTRONG-C and CEC datasets demonstrate that EndoIR achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple degradation scenarios while using fewer parameters than strong baselines, and downstream segmentation experiments confirm its clinical utility.

Title: Correct-by-Design Control Synthesis of Stochastic Multi-agent Systems: a Robust Tensor-based Solution
Authors: Ruohan Wang, Siyuan Liu, Zhiyong Sun, Sofie Haesaert
Abstract: Discrete-time stochastic systems with continuous spaces are hard to verify and control, even with MDP abstractions due to the curse of dimensionality. We propose an abstraction-based framework with robust dynamic programming mappings that deliver control strategies with provable lower bounds on temporal-logic satisfaction, quantified via approximate stochastic simulation relations. Exploiting decoupled dynamics, we reveal a Canonical Polyadic Decomposition tensor structure in value functions that makes dynamic programming scalable. The proposed method provides correct-by-design probabilistic guarantees for temporal logic specifications. We validate our results on continuous-state linear stochastic systems.

Title: QP Chaser: Polynomial Trajectory Generation for Autonomous Aerial Tracking
Authors: Yunwoo Lee, Jungwon Park, Seungwoo Jung, Boseong Jeon, Dahyun Oh, H. Jin Kim
Abstract: Maintaining the visibility of the target is one of the major objectives of aerial tracking missions. This paper proposes a target-visible trajectory planning pipeline using quadratic programming. Our approach can handle various tracking settings, including single and dual target following and both static and dynamic environments, unlike other works that focus on a single specific setup. In contrast to other studies that fully trust the predicted trajectory of the target and consider only the visibility of the center of the target, our pipeline considers error in target path prediction and the entire body of the target to maintain the target visibility robustly. First, a prediction module uses a sample-check strategy to quickly calculate the reachable areas of moving objects, which represent the areas their bodies can reach, considering obstacles. Subsequently, the planning module formulates a single QP problem, considering path homotopy, to generate a tracking trajectory that maximizes the visibility of the target's reachable area among obstacles. The performance of the planner is validated in multiple scenarios, through high-fidelity simulations and real-world experiments.

Title: Certified Robust Invariant Polytope Training in Neural Controlled ODEs
Authors: Akash Harapanahalli, Samuel Coogan
Abstract: We consider a nonlinear control system modeled as an ordinary differential equation subject to disturbance, with a state feedback controller parameterized as a feedforward neural network. We propose a framework for training controllers with certified robust forward invariant polytopes, where any trajectory initialized inside the polytope remains within the polytope, regardless of the disturbance. First, we parameterize a family of lifted control systems in a higher dimensional space, where the original neural controlled system evolves on an invariant subspace of each lifted system. We use interval analysis and neural network verifiers to further construct a family of lifted embedding systems, carefully capturing the knowledge of this invariant subspace. If the vector field of any lifted embedding system satisfies a sign constraint at a single point, then a certain convex polytope of the original system is robustly forward invariant. Treating the neural network controller and the lifted system parameters as variables, we propose an algorithm to train controllers with certified forward invariant polytopes in the closed-loop control system. Through two examples, we demonstrate how the simplicity of the sign constraint allows our approach to scale with system dimension to over $50$ states, and outperform state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based sampling approaches in runtime.

Title: SCoTT: Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking for Wireless-Aware Robot Navigation in Digital Twins
Authors: Aladin Djuhera, Amin Seffo, Vlad C. Andrei, Holger Boche, Walid Saad
Abstract: Path planning under wireless performance constraints is a complex challenge in robot navigation. However, naively incorporating such constraints into classical planning algorithms often incurs prohibitive search costs. In this paper, we propose SCoTT, a wireless-aware path planning framework that leverages vision-language models (VLMs) to co-optimize average path gains and trajectory length using wireless heatmap images and ray-tracing data from a digital twin (DT). At the core of our framework is Strategic Chain-of-Thought Tasking (SCoTT), a novel prompting paradigm that decomposes the exhaustive search problem into structured subtasks, each solved via chain-of-thought prompting. To establish strong baselines, we compare classical A* and wireless-aware extensions of it, and derive DP-WA*, an optimal, iterative dynamic programming algorithm that incorporates all path gains and distance metrics from the DT, but at significant computational cost. In extensive experiments, we show that SCoTT achieves path gains within 2% of DP-WA* while consistently generating shorter trajectories. Moreover, SCoTT's intermediate outputs can be used to accelerate DP-WA* by reducing its search space, saving up to 62% in execution time. We validate our framework using four VLMs, demonstrating effectiveness across both large and small models, thus making it applicable to a wide range of compact models at low inference cost. We also show the practical viability of our approach by deploying SCoTT as a ROS node within Gazebo simulations. Finally, we discuss data acquisition pipelines, compute requirements, and deployment considerations for VLMs in 6G-enabled DTs, underscoring the potential of natural language interfaces for wireless-aware navigation in real-world applications.

Title: On the Surprising Effectiveness of Spectral Clipping in Learning Stable Linear and Latent-Linear Dynamical Systems
Authors: Hanyao Guo, Yunhai Han, Harish Ravichandar
Abstract: When learning stable linear dynamical systems from data, three important properties are desirable: i) predictive accuracy, ii) verifiable stability, and iii) computational efficiency. Unconstrained minimization of prediction errors leads to high accuracy and efficiency but cannot guarantee stability. Existing methods to enforce stability often preserve accuracy, but do so only at the cost of increased computation. In this work, we investigate if a seemingly-naive procedure can simultaneously offer all three desiderata. Specifically, we consider a post-hoc procedure in which we surgically manipulate the spectrum of the linear system after it was learned using unconstrained least squares. We call this approach spectral clipping (SC) as it involves eigen decomposition and subsequent reconstruction of the system matrix after any eigenvalues whose magnitude exceeds one have been clipped to one (without altering the eigenvectors). We also show that SC can be readily combined with Koopman operators to learn nonlinear dynamical systems that can generate stable predictions of nonlinear phenomena, such as those underlying complex dexterous manipulation skills involving multi-fingered robotic hands. Through comprehensive experiments involving two different applications and publicly available benchmark datasets, we show that this simple technique can efficiently learn highly-accurate predictive dynamics that are provably-stable. Notably, we find that SC can match or outperform strong baselines while being orders-of-magnitude faster. Finally, we find that SC can learn stable robot policies even when the training data includes unsuccessful or truncated demonstrations. Our code and datasets can be found at this https URL.

Title: On the Convergence and Stability of Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning, and Online Decision Transformers
Authors: Miroslav Štrupl, Oleg Szehr, Francesco Faccio, Dylan R. Ashley, Rupesh Kumar Srivastava, Jürgen Schmidhuber
Abstract: This article provides a rigorous analysis of convergence and stability of Episodic Upside-Down Reinforcement Learning, Goal-Conditioned Supervised Learning and Online Decision Transformers. These algorithms performed competitively across various benchmarks, from games to robotic tasks, but their theoretical understanding is limited to specific environmental conditions. This work initiates a theoretical foundation for algorithms that build on the broad paradigm of approaching reinforcement learning through supervised learning or sequence modeling. At the core of this investigation lies the analysis of conditions on the underlying environment, under which the algorithms can identify optimal solutions. We also assess whether emerging solutions remain stable in situations where the environment is subject to tiny levels of noise. Specifically, we study the continuity and asymptotic convergence of command-conditioned policies, values and the goal-reaching objective depending on the transition kernel of the underlying Markov Decision Process. We demonstrate that near-optimal behavior is achieved if the transition kernel is located in a sufficiently small neighborhood of a deterministic kernel. The mentioned quantities are continuous (with respect to a specific topology) at deterministic kernels, both asymptotically and after a finite number of learning cycles. The developed methods allow us to present the first explicit estimates on the convergence and stability of policies and values in terms of the underlying transition kernels. On the theoretical side we introduce a number of new concepts to reinforcement learning, like working in segment spaces, studying continuity in quotient topologies and the application of the fixed-point theory of dynamical systems. The theoretical study is accompanied by a detailed investigation of example environments and numerical experiments.

Title: Quality Over Quantity? LLM-Based Curation for a Data-Efficient Audio-Video Foundation Model
Authors: Ali Vosoughi, Dimitra Emmanouilidou, Hannes Gamper
Abstract: Integrating audio and visual data for training multimodal foundational models remains a challenge. The Audio-Video Vector Alignment (AVVA) framework addresses this by considering AV scene alignment beyond mere temporal synchronization, and leveraging Large Language Models (LLMs) for data curation. AVVA implements a scoring mechanism for selecting aligned training data segments. It integrates Whisper, a speech-based foundation model, for audio and DINOv2 for video analysis in a dual-encoder structure with contrastive learning on AV pairs. Evaluations on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed model architecture and data curation approach. AVVA achieves a significant improvement in top-k accuracies for video-to-audio retrieval on all datasets compared to DenseAV, while using only 192 hrs of curated training data. Furthermore, an ablation study indicates that the data curation process effectively trades data quality for data quantity, yielding increases in top-k retrieval accuracies on AudioCaps, VALOR, and VGGSound, compared to training on the full spectrum of uncurated data.

Title: FaSDiff: Balancing Perception and Semantics in Face Compression via Stable Diffusion Priors
Authors: Yimin Zhou, Yichong Xia, Bin Chen, Mingyao Hong, Jiawei Li, Zhi Wang, Yaowei Wang
Abstract: With the increasing deployment of facial image data across a wide range of applications, efficient compression tailored to facial semantics has become critical for both storage and transmission. While recent learning-based face image compression methods have achieved promising results, they often suffer from degraded reconstruction quality at low bit rates. Directly applying diffusion-based generative priors to this task leads to suboptimal performance in downstream machine vision tasks, primarily due to poor preservation of high-frequency details. In this work, we propose FaSDiff (\textbf{Fa}cial Image Compression with a \textbf{S}table \textbf{Diff}usion Prior), a novel diffusion-driven compression framework designed to enhance both visual fidelity and semantic consistency. FaSDiff incorporates a high-frequency-sensitive compressor to capture fine-grained details and generate robust visual prompts for guiding the diffusion model. To address low-frequency degradation, we further introduce a hybrid low-frequency enhancement module that disentangles and preserves semantic structures, enabling stable modulation of the diffusion prior during reconstruction. By jointly optimizing perceptual quality and semantic preservation, FaSDiff effectively balances human visual fidelity and machine vision accuracy. Extensive experiments demonstrate that FaSDiff outperforms state-of-the-art methods in both perceptual metrics and downstream task performance.

Title: UniCUE: Unified Recognition and Generation Framework for Chinese Cued Speech Video-to-Speech Generation
Authors: Jinting Wang, Shan Yang, Chenxing Li, Dong Yu, Li Liu
Abstract: Cued Speech (CS) enhances lipreading via hand coding, offering visual phonemic cues that support precise speech perception for the hearing-impaired. The task of CS Video-to-Speech generation (CSV2S) aims to convert CS videos into intelligible speech signals. Most existing research focuses on CS Recognition (CSR), which transcribes video content into text. Consequently, a common solution for CSV2S is to integrate CSR with a text-to-speech (TTS) system. However, this pipeline relies on text as an intermediate medium, which may lead to error propagation and temporal misalignment between speech and CS video dynamics. In contrast, directly generating audio speech from CS video (direct CSV2S) often suffers from the inherent multimodal complexity and the limited availability of CS data. To address these challenges, we propose UniCUE, the first unified framework for CSV2S that directly generates speech from CS videos without relying on intermediate text. The core innovation of UniCUE lies in integrating an understanding task (CSR) that provides fine-grained CS visual-semantic cues to guide speech generation. Specifically, UniCUE incorporates a pose-aware visual processor, a semantic alignment pool that enables precise visual-semantic mapping, and a VisioPhonetic adapter to bridge the understanding and generation tasks within a unified architecture. To support this framework, we construct UniCUE-HI, a large-scale Mandarin CS dataset containing 11282 videos from 14 cuers, including both hearing-impaired and normal-hearing individuals. Extensive experiments on this dataset demonstrate that UniCUE achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple evaluation metrics.

Title: Optimism as Risk-Seeking in Multi-Agent Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Runyu Zhang, Na Li, Asuman Ozdaglar, Jeff Shamma, Gioele Zardini
Abstract: Risk sensitivity has become a central theme in reinforcement learning (RL), where convex risk measures and robust formulations provide principled ways to model preferences beyond expected return. Recent extensions to multi-agent RL (MARL) have largely emphasized the risk-averse setting, prioritizing robustness to uncertainty. In cooperative MARL, however, such conservatism often leads to suboptimal equilibria, and a parallel line of work has shown that optimism can promote cooperation. Existing optimistic methods, though effective in practice, are typically heuristic and lack theoretical grounding. Building on the dual representation for convex risk measures, we propose a principled framework that interprets risk-seeking objectives as optimism. We introduce optimistic value functions, which formalize optimism as divergence-penalized risk-seeking evaluations. Building on this foundation, we derive a policy-gradient theorem for optimistic value functions, including explicit formulas for the entropic risk/KL-penalty setting, and develop decentralized optimistic actor-critic algorithms that implement these updates. Empirical results on cooperative benchmarks demonstrate that risk-seeking optimism consistently improves coordination over both risk-neutral baselines and heuristic optimistic methods. Our framework thus unifies risk-sensitive learning and optimism, offering a theoretically grounded and practically effective approach to cooperation in MARL.

Title: Enhancing Diffusion Model Guidance through Calibration and Regularization
Authors: Seyed Alireza Javid, Amirhossein Bagheri, Nuria González-Prelcic
Abstract: Classifier-guided diffusion models have emerged as a powerful approach for conditional image generation, but they suffer from overconfident predictions during early denoising steps, causing the guidance gradient to vanish. This paper introduces two complementary contributions to address this issue. First, we propose a differentiable calibration objective based on the Smooth Expected Calibration Error (Smooth ECE), which improves classifier calibration with minimal fine-tuning and yields measurable improvements in Frechet Inception Distance (FID). Second, we develop enhanced sampling guidance methods that operate on off-the-shelf classifiers without requiring retraining. These include tilted sampling with batch-level reweighting, adaptive entropy-regularized sampling to preserve diversity, and a novel f-divergence-based sampling strategy that strengthens class-consistent guidance while maintaining mode coverage. Experiments on ImageNet 128x128 demonstrate that our divergence-regularized guidance achieves an FID of 2.13 using a ResNet-101 classifier, improving upon existing classifier-guided diffusion methods while requiring no diffusion model retraining. The results show that principled calibration and divergence-aware sampling provide practical and effective improvements for classifier-guided diffusion.
