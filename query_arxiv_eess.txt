Title: RUL-QMoE: Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Remaining Useful Life Predictions of Varying Battery Materials
Authors: Sel Ly, Rufan Yang, Ninad Dixit, Hung Dinh Nguyen
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries are the major type of battery used in a variety of everyday applications, including electric vehicles (EVs), mobile devices, and energy storage systems. Predicting the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of Li-ion batteries is crucial for ensuring their reliability, safety, and cost-effectiveness in battery-powered systems. The materials used for the battery cathodes and their designs play a significant role in determining the degradation rates and RUL, as they lead to distinct electrochemical reactions. Unfortunately, RUL prediction models often overlook the cathode materials and designs to simplify the model-building process, ignoring the effects of these electrochemical reactions. Other reasons are that specifications related to battery materials may not always be readily available, and a battery might consist of a mix of different materials. As a result, the predictive models that are developed often lack generalizability. To tackle these challenges, this paper proposes a novel material-based Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) approach for predicting the RUL of batteries, specifically addressing the complexities associated with heterogeneous battery chemistries. The MoE is integrated into a probabilistic framework, called Multiple Non-crossing Quantile Mixture-of-Experts for Probabilistic Prediction (RUL-QMoE), which accommodates battery operational conditions and enables uncertainty quantification. The RUL-QMoE model integrates specialized expert networks for five battery types: LFP, NCA, NMC, LCO, and NMC-LCO, within a gating mechanism that dynamically assigns relevance based on the battery's input features. Furthermore, by leveraging non-crossing quantile regression, the proposed RUL-QMoE produces coherent and interpretable predictive distributions of the battery's RUL, enabling robust uncertainty quantification in the battery's RUL prediction.

Authors: Bahareh Rahmani, Harsha Reddy Bindela, Rama Kanth Reddy Gosula, Krishna Yedubati, Mohammad Amir Salari, Leslie Hinyard, Payam Norouzzadeh, Eli Snir, Martin Schoen
Abstract: A combination of traditional image processing methods with advanced neural networks concretes a predictive and preventive healthcare paradigm. This study offers rapid, accurate, and non-invasive diagnostic solutions that can significantly impact patient outcomes, particularly in areas with limited access to radiologists and healthcare resources. In this project, deep learning methods apply in enhancing the diagnosis of respiratory diseases such as COVID-19, lung cancer, and pneumonia from chest x-rays. We trained and validated various neural network models, including CNNs, VGG16, InceptionV3, and EfficientNetB0, with high accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 scores to highlight the models' reliability and potential in real-world diagnostic applications.

Title: Distributed Beamforming in Massive MIMO Communication for a Constellation of Airborne Platform Stations
Authors: Hesam Khoshkbari, Georges Kaddoum, Bassant Selim, Omid Abbasi, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: Non-terrestrial base stations (NTBSs), including high-altitude platform stations (HAPSs) and hot-air balloons (HABs), are integral to next-generation wireless networks, offering coverage in remote areas and enhancing capacity in dense regions. In this paper, we propose a distributed beamforming framework for a massive MIMO network with a constellation of aerial platform stations (APSs). Our approach leverages an entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) model, where each APS operates as an independent agent using imperfect channel state information (CSI) in both training and testing phases. Unlike conventional methods, our model does not require CSI sharing among APSs, significantly reducing overhead. Simulations results demonstrate that our method outperforms zero forcing (ZF) and maximum ratio transmission (MRT) techniques, particularly in high-interference scenarios, while remaining robust to CSI imperfections. Additionally, our framework exhibits scalability, maintaining stable performance over an increasing number of users and various cluster configurations. Therefore, the proposed method holds promise for dynamic and interference-rich NTBS networks, advancing scalable and robust wireless solutions.

Title: Beamforming for Massive MIMO Aerial Communications: A Robust and Scalable DRL Approach
Authors: Hesam Khoshkbari, Georges Kaddoum, Omid Abbasi, Bassant Selim, Halim Yanikomeroglu
Abstract: This paper presents a distributed beamforming framework for a constellation of airborne platform stations (APSs) in a massive Multiple-Input and Multiple-Output (MIMO) non-terrestrial network (NTN) that targets the downlink sum-rate maximization under imperfect local channel state information (CSI). We propose a novel entropy-based multi-agent deep reinforcement learning (DRL) approach where each non-terrestrial base station (NTBS) independently computes its beamforming vector using a Fourier Neural Operator (FNO) to capture long-range dependencies in the frequency domain. To ensure scalability and robustness, the proposed framework integrates transfer learning based on a conjugate prior mechanism and a low-rank decomposition (LRD) technique, thus enabling efficient support for large-scale user deployments and aerial layers. Our simulation results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over baseline schemes including WMMSE, ZF, MRT, CNN-based DRL, and the deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) method in terms of average sum rate, robustness to CSI imperfection, user mobility, and scalability across varying network sizes and user densities. Furthermore, we show that the proposed method achieves significant computational efficiency compared to CNN-based and WMMSE methods, while reducing communication overhead in comparison with shared-critic DRL approaches.

Title: A multimodal Transformer for InSAR-based ground deformation forecasting with cross-site generalization across Europe
Authors: Wendong Yao, Binhua Huang, Soumyabrata Dev
Abstract: Near-real-time regional-scale monitoring of ground deformation is increasingly required to support urban planning, critical infrastructure management, and natural hazard mitigation. While Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) and continental-scale services such as the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) provide dense observations of past motion, predicting the next observation remains challenging due to the superposition of long-term trends, seasonal cycles, and occasional abrupt discontinuities (e.g., co-seismic steps), together with strong spatial heterogeneity. In this study we propose a multimodal patch-based Transformer for single-step, fixed-interval next-epoch nowcasting of displacement maps from EGMS time series (resampled to a 64x64 grid over 100 km x 100 km tiles). The model ingests recent displacement snapshots together with (i) static kinematic indicators (mean velocity, acceleration, seasonal amplitude) computed in a leakage-safe manner from the training window only, and (ii) harmonic day-of-year encodings. On the eastern Ireland tile (E32N34), the STGCN is strongest in the displacement-only setting, whereas the multimodal Transformer clearly outperforms CNN-LSTM, CNN-LSTM+Attn, and multimodal STGCN when all models receive the same multimodal inputs, achieving RMSE = 0.90 mm and $R^2$ = 0.97 on the test set with the best threshold accuracies.

Title: Hardware Acceleration for Neural Networks: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Bin Xu, Ayan Banerjee, Sandeep Gupta
Abstract: Neural networks have become a dominant computational workload across cloud and edge platforms, but rapid growth in model size and deployment diversity has exposed hardware bottlenecks increasingly dominated by memory movement, communication, and irregular operators rather than peak arithmetic throughput. This survey reviews the technology landscape for hardware acceleration of deep learning, spanning GPUs and tensor-core architectures; domain-specific accelerators (e.g., TPUs/NPUs); FPGA-based designs; ASIC inference engines; and emerging LLM-serving accelerators such as LPUs (language processing units), alongside in-/near-memory computing and neuromorphic/analog approaches. We organize the space using a unified taxonomy across (i) workloads (CNNs, RNNs, GNNs, and Transformers/LLMs), (ii) execution settings (training vs.\ inference; datacenter vs.\ edge), and (iii) optimization levers (reduced precision, sparsity and pruning, operator fusion, compilation and scheduling, and memory-system/interconnect design). We synthesize key architectural ideas including systolic arrays, vector and SIMD engines, specialized attention and softmax kernels, quantization-aware datapaths, and high-bandwidth memory, and we discuss how software stacks and compilers bridge model semantics to hardware. Finally, we highlight open challenges -- including efficient long-context LLM inference (KV-cache management), robust support for dynamic and sparse workloads, energy- and security-aware deployment, and fair benchmarking -- and point to promising directions for the next generation of neural acceleration.

Title: Movable Antenna Enhanced Multi-Region Beam Coverage: A Multi-Notch-Filter-Inspired Design
Authors: Dong Wang, Weidong Mei, Zhi Chen, Boyu Ning
Abstract: Movable antenna (MA) has emerged as a promising technology to enhance wireless communication performance by exploiting the new degree of freedom (DoF) via antenna position optimization. In this letter, we investigate the MA-enhanced wide beam coverage over multiple subregions in the spatial domain. Specifically, we aim to maximize the minimum beam gain over the desired subregions by jointly optimizing the transmit beamforming and antenna position vector (APV). Although this problem is non-convex, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve it by leveraging the similarity between the considered multi-region coverage and classical multi-notch filter (MNF) design. In particular, we construct a spatial MNF-based transmit beamforming vector by assuming a continuous amplitude and phase-shift profile within the antenna movement region. Based on this continuous profile, we propose a sequential update algorithm to select an optimal subset of MA positions for multi-region coverage, jointly with a Gibbs sampling (GS) procedure to avoid undesired local optimum. Numerical results show that our proposed algorithm can significantly outperform conventional fixed position antennas (FPAs) and achieve a comparable performance to the alternating optimization (AO) algorithm with dramatically lower complexity.

Title: Economic and Technical Feasibility of V2G in Non-Road Mobile Machinery sector
Authors: Rößler Nicolas, Khan Irfan, Schade Thomas, Wellmann Christoph, Cao Xinyuan, Kopynske Milan, Xia Feihong, Savelsberg Rene, Andert Jakob
Abstract: This paper investigates the economic and technical feasibility of integrating Vehicle-to-Grid (V2G) technology in the Non-Road Mobile Machinery (NRMM) sector. These often-idling assets, with their substantial battery capacities, present a unique opportunity to participate in energy markets, providing grid services and generating additional revenue. A novel methodology is introduced that integrates Bayesian Optimization (BO) to optimize the energy infrastructure together with an operating strategy optimization to reduce the electricity costs while enhancing grid interaction. While the focus lies on the methodology, the financial opportunities for the use-case of an electric NRMM rental service will be presented. However, the study is limited by the availability of real-world data on the usage of electric NRMM and does not address regulatory challenges of V2G. Further research is needed to extend the model accuracy and validate these findings.

Title: Targeted Semantic Segmentation of Himalayan Glacial Lakes Using Time-Series SAR: Towards Automated GLOF Early Warning
Authors: Pawan Adhikari, Satish Raj Regmi, Hari Ram Shrestha
Abstract: Glacial Lake Outburst Floods (GLOFs) are one of the most devastating climate change induced hazards. Existing remote monitoring approaches often prioritise maximising spatial coverage to train generalistic models or rely on optical imagery hampered by persistent cloud coverage. This paper presents an end-to-end, automated deep learning pipeline for the targeted monitoring of high-risk Himalayan glacial lakes using time-series Sentinel-1 SAR. We introduce a "temporal-first" training strategy, utilising a U-Net with an EfficientNet-B3 backbone trained on a curated dataset of a cohort of 4 lakes (Tsho Rolpa, Chamlang Tsho, Tilicho and Gokyo Lake). The model achieves an IoU of 0.9130 validating the success and efficacy of the "temporal-first" strategy required for transitioning to Early Warning Systems. Beyond the model, we propose an operational engineering architecture: a Dockerised pipeline that automates data ingestion via the ASF Search API and exposes inference results via a RESTful endpoint. This system shifts the paradigm from static mapping to dynamic and automated early warning, providing a scalable architectural foundation for future development in Early Warning Systems.

Title: Discovering Optimal Robust Minimum Redundancy Arrays (RMRAs) through Exhaustive Search and Algebraic Formulation of a New Sub-Optimal RMRA
Authors: Ashish Patwari, Sanjeeva Reddy S, G Ramachandra Reddy
Abstract: Modern sparse arrays are maximally economic in that they retain just as many sensors required to provide a specific aperture while maintaining a hole-free difference coarray. As a result, these are susceptible to the failure of even a single sensor. Contrarily, two-fold redundant sparse arrays (TFRSAs) and robust minimum redundancy arrays (RMRAs) ensure robustness against single-sensor failures due to their inherent redundancy in their coarrays. At present, optimal RMRA configurations are known only for arrays with sensor counts N=6 to N=10. To this end, this paper proposes two objectives: (i) developing a systematic algorithm to discover optimal RMRAs for N>10, and (ii) obtaining a new family of near-/sub-optimal RMRA that can be completely specified using closed-form expressions (CFEs). We solve the combinatorial optimization problem of finding RMRAs using an exhaustive search technique implemented in MATLAB. Optimal RMRAs for N = 11 to 14 were successfully found and near/sub-optimal arrays for N = 15 to 20 were determined using the proposed technique. As a byproduct of the exhaustive search, a large catalogue of valid near- and sub-optimal RMRAs was also obtained. In the second stage, CFEs for a new TFRSA were obtained by applying pattern mining and algebraic generalizations to the arrays obtained through exhaustive search. The proposed family enjoys CFEs for sensor positions, available aperture, and achievable degrees of freedom (DOFs). The CFEs have been thoroughly validated using MATLAB and are found to be valid for $N\geq8$. Hence, it can be concluded that the novelty of this work is two-fold: extending the catalogue of known optimal RMRAs and formulating a sub-optimal RMRA that abides by CFEs.

Title: Hybrid Voltage and Current Control Method for Harmonic Mitigation of Single-Phase AC Loads in DC Microgrids
Authors: Mehdi Baharizadeh, Mohammad Sadegh Golsorkhi, Neda Keshavarzi, Thomas Ebel
Abstract: DC microgrids provide an efficient framework for the interconnection of DC distributed energy resources (DERs) and DC loads. To continue to supply legacy single-phase AC loads, DC/AC converters can be integrated in the DC microgrid. The oscillatory instantaneous power of the single-phase AC load translates into a harmonic current on the converter's DC side, which increases the losses and causes unwanted voltage harmonics in the DC microgrid. To mitigate this issue, this paper proposes a hybrid voltage and current control method (HCM) for DERs. This scheme consists of an inner current control loop and an outer control layer which determines the reference for the inner loop. The outer control layer combines the DC voltage control loop with an output harmonic current control loop. This hybrid structure enables simultaneous regulation of the DC components of the DER output voltage and control of the harmonic component of the DER output current in accordance with the local single-phase AC load's demand. Frequency-domain analysis of the proposed method is presented to demonstrate the DC voltage and harmonic current loops are decoupled and there is no unwanted interaction between them. Additionally, time-domain response of the proposed scheme is validated through hardware-in-the-loop test results.

Title: Now or Never: Continuous Surveillance AIoT System for Ephemeral Events in Intermittent Sensor Networks
Authors: Joonhee Lee, Kichang Lee, Jeonggil Ko
Abstract: Wilderness monitoring tasks, such as poaching surveillance and forest fire detection, require pervasive and high-accuracy sensing. While AIoT offers a promising path, covering vast, inaccessible regions necessitates the massive deployment of maintenance-free, battery-less nodes with limited computational resources. However, these constraints create a critical `Availability Gap.' Conventional intermittent operations prioritize computation throughput, forcing sensors to sleep during energy buffering. Consequently, systems miss ephemeral, `now-or-never' events (e.g., Vocalizations of natural monuments or Fire), which is fatal for detecting rare but high-stakes anomalies. To address this, we propose an Energy-aware Elastic Split Computing Algorithm that prioritizes continuous sensing by dynamically offloading tasks to energy-rich neighbors. Preliminary results demonstrate stable monitoring of an additional $2,496\;\text{m}^2$ and the capture of approximately 103 more critical events per day. Ultimately, this algorithm establishes a robust foundation for building resilient, fail-safe surveillance systems even on resource-constrained nodes.

Title: The OCR-PT-CT Project: Semi-Automatic Recognition of Ancient Egyptian Hieroglyphs Based on Metric Learning
Authors: David Fuentes-Jimenez, Daniel Pizarro, Álvaro Hernández, Adin Bartoli, César Guerra Méndez, Laura de Diego-Otón, Sira Palazuelos-Cagigas, Carlos Gracia Zamacona
Abstract: Digital humanities are significantly transforming how Egyptologists study ancient Egyptian texts. The OCR-PT-CT project proposes a recognition method for hieroglyphs based on images of Coffin Texts (CT) from Adriaan de Buck (1935-1961) and Pyramid Texts (PT) from Middle Kingdom coffins (James Allen, 2006). The system identifies hieroglyphs and transcribes them into Gardiner's codes. A web tool organizes them by spells and witnesses, storing the data in CSV format for integration with the MORTEXVAR dataset, which collects Coffin Texts with metadata, transliterations, and translations for research. Recognition has been addressed in two ways: a Mobilenet neural network trained on 140 hieroglyph classes achieved 93.87 \% accuracy but struggled with underrepresented classes. A novel Deep Metric Learning approach improves flexibility for new or data-limited signs, achieving 97.70 \% accuracy and recognizing more hieroglyphs. Due to its superior performance under class imbalance and adaptability, the final system adopts Deep Metric Learning as the default classifier.

Title: Quantifying the advantage of vector over scalar magnetic sensor networks for undersea surveillance
Authors: Wenchao Li, Xuezhi Wang, Qiang Sun, Allison N. Kealy, Andrew D. Greentree
Abstract: Magnetic monitoring of maritime environments is an important problem for monitoring and optimising shipping, as well as national security. New developments in compact, fibre-coupled quantum magnetometers have led to the opportunity to critically evaluate how best to create such a sensor network. Here we explore various magnetic sensor network architectures for target identification. Our modelling compares networks of scalar vs vector magnetometers. We implement an unscented Kalman filter approach to perform target tracking, and we find that vector networks provide a significant improvement in target tracking, specifically tracking accuracy and resilience compared with scalar networks.

Title: Safe Sliding Mode Control for Marine Vessels Using High-Order Control Barrier Functions and Fast Projection
Authors: Spyridon Syntakas, Kostas Vlachos
Abstract: This paper presents a novel safe control framework that integrates Sliding Mode Control (SMC), High-Order Control Barrier Functions (HOCBFs) with state-dependent adaptiveness and a lightweight projection for collision-free navigation of an over-actuated 3-DOF marine surface vessel subjected to strong environmental disturbances (wind, waves, and current). SMC provides robustness to matched disturbances common in marine operations, while HOCBFs enforce forward invariance of obstacle-avoidance constraints. A fast half-space projection method adjusts the SMC control only when needed, preserving robustness and minimizing chattering. The approach is evaluated on a nonlinear marine platform model that includes added mass, hydrodynamic damping, and full thruster allocation. Simulation results show robust navigation, guaranteed obstacle avoidance, and computational efficiency suitable for real-time embedded use. For small marine robots and surface vessels with limited onboard computational resources-where execution speed and computational efficiency are critical-the SMC-HOCBF framework constitutes a strong candidate for safety-critical control.

Title: Generative Video Compression: Towards 0.01% Compression Rate for Video Transmission
Authors: Xiangyu Chen, Jixiang Luo, Jingyu Xu, Fangqiu Yi, Chi Zhang, Xuelong Li
Abstract: Whether a video can be compressed at an extreme compression rate as low as 0.01%? To this end, we achieve the compression rate as 0.02% at some cases by introducing Generative Video Compression (GVC), a new framework that redefines the limits of video compression by leveraging modern generative video models to achieve extreme compression rates while preserving a perception-centric, task-oriented communication paradigm, corresponding to Level C of the Shannon-Weaver model. Besides, How we trade computation for compression rate or bandwidth? GVC answers this question by shifting the burden from transmission to inference: it encodes video into extremely compact representations and delegates content reconstruction to the receiver, where powerful generative priors synthesize high-quality video from minimal transmitted information. Is GVC practical and deployable? To ensure practical deployment, we propose a compression-computation trade-off strategy, enabling fast inference on consume-grade GPUs. Within the AI Flow framework, GVC opens new possibility for video communication in bandwidth- and resource-constrained environments such as emergency rescue, remote surveillance, and mobile edge computing. Through empirical validation, we demonstrate that GVC offers a viable path toward a new effective, efficient, scalable, and practical video communication paradigm.

Title: OptiVote: Non-Coherent FSO Over-the-Air Majority Vote for Communication-Efficient Distributed Federated Learning in Space Data Centers
Authors: Anbang Zhang, Chenyuan Feng, Wai Ho Mow, Jia Ye, Shuaishuai Guo, Geyong Min, Tony Q. S. Quek
Abstract: The rapid deployment of mega-constellations is driving the long-term vision of space data centers (SDCs), where interconnected satellites form in-orbit distributed computing and learning infrastructures. Enabling distributed federated learning in such systems is challenging because iterative training requires frequent aggregation over inter-satellite links that are bandwidth- and energy-constrained, and the link conditions can be highly dynamic. In this work, we exploit over-the-air computation (AirComp) as an in-network aggregation primitive. However, conventional coherent AirComp relies on stringent phase alignment, which is difficult to maintain in space environments due to satellite jitter and Doppler effects. To overcome this limitation, we propose OptiVote, a robust and communication-efficient non-coherent free-space optical (FSO) AirComp framework for federated learning toward Space Data Centers. OptiVote integrates sign stochastic gradient descent (signSGD) with a majority-vote (MV) aggregation principle and pulse-position modulation (PPM), where each satellite conveys local gradient signs by activating orthogonal PPM time slots. The aggregation node performs MV detection via non-coherent energy accumulation, transforming phase-sensitive field superposition into phase-agnostic optical intensity combining, thereby eliminating the need for precise phase synchronization and improving resilience under dynamic impairments. To mitigate aggregation bias induced by heterogeneous FSO channels, we further develop an importance-aware, channel state information (CSI)-free dynamic power control scheme that balances received energies without additional signaling. We provide theoretical analysis by characterizing the aggregate error probability under statistical FSO channels and establishing convergence guarantees for non-convex objectives.

Title: New Insights into Cascaded Geometric Flight Control: From Performance Guarantees to Practical Pitfalls
Authors: Brett T. Lopez
Abstract: We present a new stability proof for cascaded geometric control used by aerial vehicles tracking time-varying position trajectories. Our approach uses sliding variables and a recently proposed quaternion-based sliding controller to demonstrate that exponentially convergent position trajectory tracking is theoretically possible. Notably, our analysis reveals new aspects of the control strategy, including how tracking error in the attitude loop influences the position loop, how model uncertainties affect the closed-loop system, and the practical pitfalls of the control architecture.

Title: Low-complexity spectral shaping method for OFDM signals with dynamically adaptive emission mask
Authors: Javier Giménez, José A. Cortés, Luis Díez
Abstract: Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) signals with rectangular pulses exhibit low spectral confinement. Shaping their power spectral density (PSD) is imperative in the increasingly overcrowded spectrum to benefit from the cognitive radio (CR) paradigm. However, since the available spectrum is non-contiguous and its occupancy changes with time, the spectral shaping solution has to be dynamically adapted. This work proposes a framework that allows using a reduced set of preoptimized pulses to shape the spectrum of OFDM signals, irrespective of its spectral width and location, by means of simple transformations. The employed pulses combine active interference cancellation (AIC) and adaptive symbol transition (AST) terms in a transparent way to the receiver. They can be easily adapted online by the communication device to changes in the location or width of the transmission band, which contrasts with existing methods of the same type that require solving NP-hard optimization problems.

Title: Multipliers for forced Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities
Authors: William Paul Heath, Sayar Das, Joaquin Carrasco
Abstract: Dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee the stability of Lurye systems with slope-restricted nonlinearities, but give no guarantee that the closed-loop system has finite incremental gain. We show that multipliers guarantee the closed-loop power gain to be bounded and quantifiable. Power may be measured about an appropriate steady state bias term, provided the multiplier does not require the nonlinearity to be odd. Hence dynamic multipliers can be used to guarantee such Lurye systems have low sensitivity to noise, provided other exogenous signals have constant steady state. For periodic excitation, the closed-loop response can apparently have a subharmonic or chaotic response. We revisit a class of multipliers that can guarantee a unique, attractive and period-preserving solution. We show the multipliers can be derived using classical tools and reconsider assumptions required for their application. Their phase limitations are inherited from those of discrete-time multipliers. The multipliers cannot be used at all frequencies unless the circle criterion can also be applied; this is consistent with known results about dynamic multipliers and incremental stability.

Title: Design of Linear Residual Generators for Combined Fault Detection and Estimation in Nonlinear Systems
Authors: Sunjeev Venkateswaran, Costas Kravaris
Abstract: A systematic method for the design of linear residual generators for combined fault detection and estimation in nonlinear systems is developed. The proposed residual generator is a linear functional observer built for an extended system that incorporates the fault dynamics from a linear exo-system, and in addition possesses disturbance-decoupling properties. Necessary and sufficient conditions for the existence of such residual generators for nonlinear systems are derived. As long as these conditions are satisfied, we obtain explicit design formulas for the residual generator. The results are illustrated through a chemical reactor case study, which demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.

Title: The Wigner-Ville Transform as an Information Theoretic Tool in Radio-frequency Signal Analysis
Authors: Erik Lentz, Emily Ellwein, Bill Kay, Audun Myers, Cameron Mackenzie
Abstract: This paper presents novel interpretations to the field of classical signal processing of the Wigner-Ville transform as an information measurement tool. The transform's utility in detecting and localizing information-laden signals amidst noisy and cluttered backgrounds, and further providing measure of their information volumes, are detailed herein using Tsallis' entropy and information and related functionals. Example use cases in radio frequency communications are given, where Wigner-Ville-based detection measures can be seen to provide significant sensitivity advantage, for some shown contexts greater than 15~dB advantage, over energy-based measures and without extensive training routines. Such an advantage is particularly significant for applications which have limitations on observation resources including time/space integration pressures and transient and/or feeble signals, where Wigner-Ville-based methods would improve sensing effectiveness by multiple orders of magnitude. The potential for advancement of several such applications is discussed.

Title: Automated Classification of First-Trimester Fetal Heart Views Using Ultrasound-Specific Self-Supervised Learning
Authors: Youssef Megahed, Aylin Erman, Robin Ducharme, Mark C. Walker, Steven Hawken, Adrian D. C. Chan
Abstract: Congenital heart disease remains the most common congenital anomaly and a leading cause of neonatal morbidity and mortality. Although first-trimester fetal echocardiography offers an opportunity for earlier detection, automated analysis at this stage is challenging due to small cardiac structures, low signal-to-noise ratio, and substantial inter-operator variability. In this work, we evaluate a self-supervised ultrasound foundation model, USF-MAE, for first-trimester fetal heart view classification. USF-MAE is pretrained using masked autoencoding modelling on more than 370,000 unlabelled ultrasound images spanning over 40 anatomical regions and is subsequently fine-tuned for downstream classification. As a proof of concept, the pretrained Vision Transformer encoder was fine-tuned on an open-source dataset of 6,720 first-trimester fetal echocardiography images to classify five categories: aorta, atrioventricular flows, V sign, X sign, and Other. Model performance was benchmarked against supervised convolutional neural network baselines (ResNet-18 and ResNet-50) and a Vision Transformer (ViT-B/16) model pretrained on natural images (ImageNet-1k). All models were trained and evaluated using identical preprocessing, data splits, and optimization protocols. On an independent test set, USF-MAE achieved the highest performance across all evaluation metrics, with 90.57% accuracy, 91.15% precision, 90.57% recall, and 90.71% F1-score. This represents an improvement of +2.03% in accuracy and +1.98% in F1-score compared with the strongest baseline, ResNet-18. The proposed approach demonstrated robust performance without reliance on aggressive image preprocessing or region-of-interest cropping and showed improved discrimination of non-diagnostic frames.

Title: Energy-Aware Bayesian Control Barrier Functions for Physics-Informed Gaussian Process Dynamics
Authors: Chi Ho Leung, Philip E. Paré
Abstract: We study safe control for dynamical systems whose continuous-time dynamics are learned with Gaussian processes (GPs), focusing on mechanical and port-Hamiltonian systems where safety is naturally expressed via energy constraints. The availability of a GP Hamiltonian posterior naturally raises the question of how to systematically exploit this structure to design an energy-aware control barrier function with high-probability safety guarantees. We address this problem by developing a Bayesian-CBF framework and instantiating it with energy-aware Bayesian-CBFs (EB-CBFs) that construct conservative energy-based barriers directly from the Hamiltonian and vector-field posteriors, yielding safety filters that minimally modify a nominal controller while providing probabilistic energy safety guarantees. Numerical simulations on a mass-spring system demonstrate that the proposed EB-CBFs achieve high-probability safety under noisy sampled GP-learned dynamics.

Title: A Graph Neural Network with Auxiliary Task Learning for Missing PMU Data Reconstruction
Authors: Bo Li, Zijun Chen, Haiwang Zhong, Di Cao, Guangchun Ruan
Abstract: In wide-area measurement systems (WAMS), phasor measurement unit (PMU) measurement is prone to data missingness due to hardware failures, communication delays, and cyber-attacks. Existing data-driven methods are limited by inadaptability to concept drift in power systems, poor robustness under high missing rates, and reliance on the unrealistic assumption of full system observability. Thus, this paper proposes an auxiliary task learning (ATL) method for reconstructing missing PMU data. First, a K-hop graph neural network (GNN) is proposed to enable direct learning on the subgraph consisting of PMU nodes, overcoming the limitation of the incompletely observable system. Then, an auxiliary learning framework consisting of two complementary graph networks is designed for accurate reconstruction: a spatial-temporal GNN extracts spatial-temporal dependencies from PMU data to reconstruct missing values, and another auxiliary GNN utilizes the low-rank property of PMU data to achieve unsupervised online learning. In this way, the low-rank properties of the PMU data are dynamically leveraged across the architecture to ensure robustness and self-adaptation. Numerical results demonstrate the superior offline and online performance of the proposed method under high missing rates and incomplete observability.

Title: Power Minimization in Pinching-Antenna Systems under Probabilistic LoS Blockage
Authors: Lei Li, Yanqing Xu, Tenghao Cai, Tsung-Hui Chang
Abstract: With great flexibility to adjust antenna positions, pinching antennas (PAs) are promising for alleviating large-scale attenuation in wireless networks. In this work, we investigate the antenna positioning and beamforming (AP-BF) design in a multi-PA multi-user system under probabilistic light-of-sight (LoS) blockage and formulate a power minimization problem subject to per-user signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) constraints. For a single PA, we prove the convexity of the simplified problem and obtain its global optimum. For multiple PAs, we derive closed-form BF structures and develop an efficient first-order algorithm to achieve high-quality local solutions. Extensive numerical results validate the efficacy of our proposed designs and the substantial performance advantage of PA systems compared with conventional fixed-antenna systems in a term of power saving.

Title: Resource Allocation via Backscatter-Aware Transmit Antenna Selection for Low-PAPR and Ultra-Reliable WSNs
Authors: Rahul Gulia, Ashish Sheikh, Feyisayo Favour Popoola, Serisha Vadlamudi
Abstract: This paper addresses a fundamental physical layer conflict in hybrid Wireless Sensor Networks (WSNs) between high-throughput primary communication and the stringent power envelope requirements of passive backscatter sensors. We propose a Backscatter-Constrained Transmit Antenna Selection (BC-TAS) framework, a per-subcarrier selection strategy for multi-antenna illuminators operating within a Multi-Dimensional Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (MD-OFDM) architecture. Unlike conventional signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) centric selection schemes, BC-TAS employs a multi-objective cost function that jointly maximizes desired link reliability, stabilizes the incident RF energy envelope at passive Surface Acoustic Wave (SAW) sensors, and suppresses interference toward coexisting victim receivers. By exploiting the inherent sparsity of MD-OFDM, the proposed framework enables dual-envelope regulation, simultaneously reducing the transmitter Peak-to-Average Power Ratio (PAPR) and the Backscatter Crest Factor (BCF) observed at the tag. To enhance robustness under imperfect Channel State Information (CSI), a Kalman-based channel smoothing mechanism is incorporated to maintain selection stability in low-SNR regimes. Numerical results using IEEE 802.11be dispersive channel models and a nonlinear Rapp power amplifier demonstrate that BC-TAS achieves orders-of-magnitude improvement in outage probability and significant gains in energy efficiency compared to conventional MU-MIMO baselines, while ensuring spectral mask compliance under reduced power amplifier back-off. These results establish BC-TAS as an effective illuminator-side control mechanism for enabling reliable and energy-stable sensing and communication coexistence in dense, power-constrained wireless environments.

Title: Decentralized No-Regret Frequency-Time Scheduling for FMCW Radar Interference Avoidance
Authors: Yunian Pan, Jun Li, Lifan Xu, Shunqiao Sun, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: Automotive FMCW radars are indispensable to modern ADAS and autonomous-driving systems, but their increasing density has intensified the risk of mutual interference. Existing mitigation techniques, including reactive receiver-side suppression, proactive waveform design, and cooperative scheduling, often face limitations in scalability, reliance on side-channel communication, or degradation of range-Doppler resolution. Building on our earlier work on decentralized Frequency-Domain No-Regret hopping, this paper introduces a unified time-frequency game-theoretic framework that enables radars to adapt across both spectral and temporal resources. We formulate the interference-avoidance problem as a repeated anti-coordination game, in which each radar autonomously updates a mixed strategy over frequency subbands and chirp-level time offsets using regret-minimization dynamics. We show that the proposed Time-Frequency No-Regret Hopping algorithm achieves vanishing external and swap regret, and that the induced empirical play converges to an $\varepsilon$-coarse correlated equilibrium or a correlated equilibrium. Theoretical analysis provides regret bounds in the joint domain, revealing how temporal adaptation implicitly regularizes frequency selection and enhances robustness against asynchronous interference. Numerical experiments with multi-radar scenarios demonstrate substantial improvements in SINR, collision rate, and range-Doppler quality compared with time-frequency random hopping and centralized Nash-based benchmarks.

Title: A Uniform Pilot and Data Payload Optimization Framework for OTFS-Based ISAC
Authors: Borui Du, Yumeng Zhang, Christos Masouros, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: The orthogonal time frequency space (OTFS) signal is considered a promising solution for high-mobility wireless environments. It manages Doppler effects by utilizing delay-Doppler (DD) domain processing. However, the relatively long OTFS frame duration could introduce considerable sensing or communication latency when radar and communication are performed separately. By operating in a dual-functional radar and communication (DFRC) mode, the OTFS system performs sensing and data transmission simultaneously, thereby reducing the resulting latency. Nevertheless, the optimal OTFS DFRC signal strategy remains insufficiently explored. This paper investigates the optimal signal design for OTFS DFRC systems, focusing on pilot symbol design and data symbol power allocation. Specifically, we derive a channel capacity lower bound metric for communication that considers channel estimation errors in OTFS. For sensing, we derive an integrated sidelobe level (ISL), accounting for the randomness of the data symbols alongside the deterministic pilot symbols. Leveraging the above metrics, we formulate an optimization problem that balances radar and communication performance, and then solve it using an alternating optimization framework. We validate the proposed signal through numerical analysis and Monte Carlo simulations. Our analysis shows that OTFS DFRC enforces a deterministic pilot signal that is characterized by a concentrated peak in the DD domain, which furnishes a common structure in the DD domain facilitating sensing and channel estimation, with data multiplexed in other DD grids, thereby unifying sensing and communication within a single OTFS signal. Compared with conventional OTFS signals, the proposed OTFS DFRC signal expands the achievable sensing-communication performance region, delivering at least a 9.45 dB ISL suppression for sensing and a 4.82 dB SINR ratio gain for communication.

Title: Taking Advantage of Rational Canonical Form for Faster Ring-LWE based Encrypted Controller with Recursive Multiplication
Authors: Donghyeon Song, Yeongjun Jang, Joowon Lee, Junsoo Kim
Abstract: This paper aims to provide an efficient implementation of encrypted linear dynamic controllers that perform recursive multiplications on a Ring-Learning With Errors (Ring-LWE) based cryptosystem. By adopting a system-theoretical approach, we significantly reduce both time and space complexities, particularly the number of homomorphic operations required for recursive multiplications. Rather than encrypting the entire state matrix of a given controller, the state matrix is transformed into its rational canonical form, whose sparse and circulant structure enables that encryption and computation are required only on its nontrivial columns. Furthermore, we propose a novel method to ``pack'' each of the input and the output matrices into a single polynomial, thereby reducing the number of homomorphic operations. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed design enables a remarkably fast implementation of encrypted controllers.

Title: An Adaptive, Disentangled Representation for Multidimensional MRI Reconstruction
Authors: Ruiyang Zhao, Fan Lam
Abstract: We present a new approach for representing and reconstructing multidimensional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. Our method builds on a novel, learned feature-based image representation that disentangles different types of features, such as geometry and contrast, into distinct low-dimensional latent spaces, enabling better exploitation of feature correlations in multidimensional images and incorporation of pre-learned priors specific to different feature types for reconstruction. More specifically, the disentanglement was achieved via an encoderdecoder network and image transfer training using large public data, enhanced by a style-based decoder design. A latent diffusion model was introduced to impose stronger constraints on distinct feature spaces. New reconstruction formulations and algorithms were developed to integrate the learned representation with a zero-shot selfsupervised learning adaptation and subspace modeling. The proposed method has been evaluated on accelerated T1 and T2 parameter mapping, achieving improved performance over state-of-the-art reconstruction methods, without task-specific supervised training or fine-tuning. This work offers a new strategy for learning-based multidimensional image reconstruction where only limited data are available for problem-specific or task-specific training.

Title: Waste-to-Energy-Coupled AI Data Centers: Cooling Efficiency and Grid Resilience
Authors: Qi He, Chunyu Qu
Abstract: AI data-center expansion is increasingly constrained by the coupled availability of deliverable electricity and heat-rejection (cooling) capacity. We propose and evaluate an integrated Waste-to-Energy-AI Data Center configuration that treats cooling as a first-class energy service rather than an unavoidable electricity burden. The coupled system is modeled as an input-output 'black box' with transparent boundaries and a standalone benchmark in which mechanical chilling is powered by grid electricity. The central mechanism is energy-grade matching: low-grade WtE thermal output drives absorption cooling to deliver chilled service, thereby displacing baseline cooling electricity. We show that thermoeconomic superiority is governed by three first-order determinants, (i) cooling coverage of IT heat load, (ii) parasitic electricity for transport and auxiliaries, and (iii) distance-driven delivery decay, yielding a break-even corridor beyond which net benefits vanish. Comparative statics characterize sensitivity to IT utilization, feedstock quality (waste LHV and throughput), climate parameterization, and corridor distance. We translate these accounting gains into decision language through a computable prototype for Levelized Cost of Computing (LCOC) and an ESG valuation channel grounded in measurable mechanisms, without re-deriving full lifecycle inventories. The framework provides siting-ready feasibility conditions for WtE-AIDC coupling in urban AI corridors under grid stress.

Title: Average Consensus with Dynamic Quantization Framing and Finite-Time Termination over Limited-Bandwidth Directed Networks
Authors: Evagoras Makridis, Gabriele Oliva, Apostolos I. Rikos, Themistoklis Charalambous
Abstract: This paper proposes a deterministic distributed algorithm, referred to as PP-ACDC, that achieves exact average consensus over possibly unbalanced directed graphs using only a fixed and a priori specified number of quantization bits. The method integrates Push-Pull (surplus) consensus dynamics with a dynamic quantization framing scheme combining zooming and midpoint shifting, enabling agents to preserve the true global average while progressively refining their quantization precision. We establish a rigorous convergence theory showing that PP-ACDC achieves asymptotic (exact) average consensus on any strongly connected digraph under appropriately chosen quantization parameters. Moreover, we develop a fully distributed and synchronized finite-time termination mechanism, and we provide a formal proof on the detection of $\epsilon$-convergence to the average within a finite number of iterations. Numerical simulations corroborate the theoretical results and demonstrate that PP-ACDC achieves reliable, communication-efficient, and precise average consensus even under very tight bit budgets, underscoring its suitability for large-scale and resource-constrained multi-agent systems operating over directed networks.

Title: Beam-Squint-Aided Hierarchical Sensing for Integrated Sensing and Communications with Uniform Planar Arrays
Authors: Jaehong Jo, Jihun Park, Yo-Seb Jeon, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a novel hierarchical sensing framework for wideband integrated sensing and communications with uniform planar arrays (UPAs). Leveraging the beam-squint effect inherent in wideband orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) systems, the proposed framework enables efficient two-dimensional angle estimation through a structured multi-stage sensing process. Specifically, the sensing procedure first searches over the elevation angle domain, followed by a dedicated search over the azimuth angle domain given the estimated elevation angles. In each stage, true-time-delay lines and phase shifters of the UPA are jointly configured to cover multiple grid points simultaneously across OFDM subcarriers. To enable accurate and efficient target localization, we formulate the angle estimation problem as a sparse signal recovery problem and develop a modified matching pursuit algorithm tailored to the hierarchical sensing architecture. Additionally, we design power allocation strategies that minimize total transmit power while meeting performance requirements for both sensing and communication. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed framework achieves superior performance over conventional sensing methods with reduced sensing power.

Title: Exact compensation of communication delays for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent linear systems with applications to SIR epidemic model
Authors: Qin Fang, Mamadou Diagne, Yang Zhu
Abstract: This paper investigates the output synchronization problem for discrete-time heterogeneous multi-agent systems (MASs) subject to distinct communication delays. The presence of such delays prevents the instantaneous delivery of information from neighboring nodes, thereby severely degrading the performance of standard distributed control schemes. To overcome this, we propose a prediction-based framework for exact delay compensation. Specifically, we introduce predictors combined with a mechanism of distributed predictors, which enables the recursive reconstruction of future state information across the communication network. Building upon these predictors, we construct prediction-based distributed observers and formulate both prediction-based distributed state-feedback and dynamic output-feedback controllers. Theoretical analysis confirms that the proposed strategy eliminates the impact of delays after a finite number of steps, ensuring output synchronization. The effectiveness of the methods is validated through a numerical example and a Koopman operator-based linear Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) epidemic model. Notably, for a population of 4 million, the proposed delay compensation strategy achieves a reduction of over 200,000 infected individuals at the peak, underscoring its potential significance in epidemic mitigation.

Title: Trustworthy Equipment Monitoring via Cascaded Anomaly Detection and Thermal Localization
Authors: Sungwoo Kang
Abstract: Predictive maintenance demands accurate anomaly detection and trustable explanations. Although multimodal fusion of sensor time-series and thermal imagery shows promise, we demonstrate that naive fusion strategies can paradoxically degrade performance. This paper introduces a Cascaded Anomaly Detection framework that decouples detection and localization. Stage 1 employs an LSTM-based sensor encoder with temporal attention for high-accuracy detection, while Stage 2 activates a CNN-based thermal encoder for post-detection fault localization. Our results reveal that sensor-only detection outperforms full fusion by 8.3 percentage points (93.08% vs. 84.79% F1-score), challenging the assumption that additional modalities invariably improve performance. We further contribute an explainability pipeline integrating SHAP, temporal/spatial attention, and gate weight analysis. This analysis uncovers a "modality bias" where fusion models assign 65-87% weight to the weaker thermal modality. Validated on a real-world bearing dataset (78,397 samples), our cascaded approach achieves state-of-the-art accuracy while providing actionable diagnostics for maintenance decision-making.

Title: Digitalizing Over-the-Air Computation via The Novel Complement Coded Modulation
Authors: Zhixu Wang, Jiacheng Yao, Wei Xu, Wei Shi, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: To overcome inherent limitations of analog signals in over-the-air computation (AirComp), this letter proposes a two's complement-based coding scheme for the AirComp implementation with compatible digital modulations. Specifically, quantized discrete values are encoded into binary sequences using the two's complement and transmitted over multiple subcarriers. At the receiver, we design a decoder that constructs a functional mapping between the superimposed digital modulation signals and the target of computational results, theoretically ensuring asymptotic error free computation with the minimal codeword length. To further mitigate the adverse effects of channel fading, we adopt a truncated inversion strategy for pre-processing. Benefiting from the unified symbol distribution after the proposed encoding, we derive the optimal linear minimum mean squared error (LMMSE) detector in closed form and propose a low complexity algorithm seeking for the optimal truncation selection. Furthermore, the inherent importance differences among the coded outputs motivate an uneven power allocation strategy across subcarriers to improve computational accuracy. Numerical results validate the superiority of the proposed scheme over existing digital AirComp approaches, especially at low signal to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes.

Title: Efficient Joint Resource Allocation for Wireless Powered ISAC with Target Localization
Authors: Boyao Li, Qinwei He, Boao Zhang, Xiaopeng Yuan, Anke Schmeink
Abstract: Wireless powered integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) faces a fundamental tradeoff between energy supply, communication throughput, and sensing accuracy. This paper investigates a wireless powered ISAC system with target localization requirements, where users harvest energy from wireless power transfer (WPT) and then conduct ISAC transmissions in a time-division manner. In addition to energy supply, the WPT signal also contributes to target sensing, and the localization accuracy is characterized by Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) constraints. Under this setting, we formulate a max-min throughput maximization problem by jointly allocating the WPT duration, ISAC transmission time allocation, and transmit power. Due to the nonconvexity of the resulting problem, a suitable reformulation is developed by exploiting variable substitutions and the monotonicity of logarithmic functions, based on which an efficient successive convex approximation (SCA)-based iterative algorithm is proposed. Simulation results demonstrate convergence and significant performance gains over benchmark schemes, highlighting the importance of coordinated time-power optimization in balancing sensing accuracy and communication performance in wireless powered ISAC systems.

Title: Heterogeneous Multi-Agent Multi-Target Tracking using Cellular Sheaves
Authors: Tyler Hanks, Cristian F. Nino, Joana Bou Barcelo, Austin Copeland, Warren Dixon, James Fairbanks
Abstract: Multi-agent target tracking in the presence of nonlinear dynamics and agent heterogeneity, where state-space dimensions may differ, is a challenging problem that traditional graph Laplacian methods cannot easily address. This work leverages the framework of cellular sheaves, a mathematical generalization of graph theory, to natively model such heterogeneous systems. While existing coordination sheaf frameworks focus on cooperative problems like consensus, this work extends them to the non-cooperative target-tracking problem. The tracking of multiple, unknown targets is formulated as a harmonic extension problem on a cellular sheaf, accommodating nonlinear dynamics and external disturbances for all agents. A decentralized control law is developed using the sheaf Laplacian, and a corresponding Lyapunov-based stability analysis is provided to guarantee tracking error convergence, with results validated by simulation.

Title: One-Shot Camera-Based Extrusion Optimization for High Speed Fused Filament Fabrication
Authors: Yufan Lin, Xavier Guidetti, Yannick Nagel, Efe C. Balta, John Lygeros
Abstract: Off-the-shelf fused filament fabrication 3D printers are widely accessible and convenient, yet they exhibit quality loss at high speeds due to dynamic mis-synchronization between printhead motion and material extrusion systems, notably corner over-extrusion. Existing methods require specialized hardware, extensive calibration, or firmware modifications that are inaccessible to most users. This work presents a practical, end-to-end optimization framework that enhances high-speed printing using only standard 3D printers and a phone camera, without requiring additional complex setup. The method employs a one-shot calibration approach in which two simple printed patterns, captured by a phone camera, enable identification of extrusion dynamics and cornering behavior. The identified systems enable a model-based constrained optimal control strategy that generates optimized G-code, synchronizing motion and extrusion. Experiments show reduced width tracking error, mitigated corner defects, and lower surface roughness, achieving surface quality at 3600 mm/min comparable to conventional printing at 1600 mm/min, effectively doubling production speed while maintaining print quality. This accessible, hardware-minimal approach enables a wide range of fused filament fabrication users to achieve high-quality, high-speed additive manufacturing.

Title: No Vision, No Wearables: 5G-based 2D Human Pose Recognition with Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Haojin Li, Dongzhe Li, Anbang Zhang, Wenqi Zhang, Chen Sun, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: With the increasing maturity of contactless human pose recognition (HPR) technology, indoor interactive applications have raised higher demands for natural, controller-free interaction methods. However, current mainstream HPR solutions relying on vision or radio-frequency (RF) (including WiFi, radar) still face various challenges in practical deployment, such as privacy concerns, susceptibility to occlusion, dedicated equipment and functions, and limited sensing resolution and range. 5G-based integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) technology, by merging communication and sensing functions, offers a new approach to address these challenges in contactless HPR. We propose a practical 5G-based ISAC system capable of inferring 2D HPR from uplink sounding reference signals (SRS). Specifically, rich features are extracted from multiple domains and employ an encoder to achieve unified alignment and representation in a latent space. Subsequently, low-dimensional features are fused to output the human pose state. Experimental results demonstrate that in typical indoor environments, our proposed 5G-based ISAC HPR system significantly outperforms current mainstream baseline solutions in HPR performance, providing a solid technical foundation for universal human-computer interaction.

Title: Fundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing -- Part I: Narrow-Band Systems
Authors: Tong Wei, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M.R., Björn Ottersten
Abstract: Extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) envisioned for 6G enable high-resolution sensing. However, the ELAAs worked in extremely high frequency will push operation into the near-field region, where spherical wavefronts invalidate classical far-field models and alter fundamental estimation limits. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part II) is to develop the theory of fundamental limits for near-field sensing systems in detail. In this paper (Part I), we develop a unified narrow-band near-field signal model for joint parameter sensing of moving targets using the ELAAs. Leveraging the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive closed-form Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section (RCS) under the slow-time sampling model. To obtain interpretable insights, we further establish explicit far-field and near-field approximations that reveal how the bounds scale with array aperture, target range, carrier wavelength, and coherent integration length. The resulting expressions expose the roles of self-information terms and their cross terms, clarifying when Fresnel corrections become non-negligible and providing beamformer and algorithm design guidelines for near-field sensing with ELAAs. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and their far-field and near-field approximations, demonstrating accurate agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative array sizes and target ranges.

Title: Fundamental Limits for Near-Field Sensing -- Part II: Wide-Band Systems
Authors: Tong Wei, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Bhavani Shankar M.R., Björn Ottersten
Abstract: Near-field sensing with extremely large-scale antenna arrays (ELAAs) in practical 6G systems is expected to operate over broad bandwidths, where delay, Doppler, and spatial effects become tightly coupled across frequency. The purpose of this and the companion paper (Part I) is to develop the unified Cram'er--Rao bounds (CRBs) for sensing systems spanning from far-field to near-field, and narrow-band to wide-band. This paper (Part II) derives fundamental estimation limits for a wide-band near-field sensing systems employing orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing signaling over a coherent processing interval. We establish an exact near-field wide-band signal model that captures frequency-dependent propagation, spherical-wave geometry, and the intrinsic coupling between target location and motion parameters across subcarriers and slow time. Similar as Part I using the Slepian--Bangs formulation, we derive the wide-band Fisher information matrix and the CRBs for joint estimation of target position, velocity, and radar cross-section, and we show how wide-band information aggregates across orthogonal subcarriers. We further develop tractable far-field and near-field approximations which provide design-level insights into the roles of bandwidth, coherent integration length, and array aperture, and clarify when wide-band effects. Simulation results validate the derived CRBs and its approximations, demonstrating close agreement with the analytical scaling laws across representative ranges, bandwidths, and array configurations.

Title: Overflow-Avoiding Memory AMP
Authors: Shunqi Huang, Lei Liu, Brian M. Kurkoski
Abstract: Approximate Message Passing (AMP) type algorithms are widely used for signal recovery in high-dimensional noisy linear systems. Recently, a principle called Memory AMP (MAMP) was proposed. Leveraging this principle, the gradient descent MAMP (GD-MAMP) algorithm was designed, inheriting the strengths of AMP and OAMP/VAMP. In this paper, we first provide an overflow-avoiding GD-MAMP (OA-GD-MAMP) to address the overflow problem that arises from some intermediate variables exceeding the range of floating point numbers. Second, we develop a complexity-reduced GD-MAMP (CR-GD-MAMP) to reduce the number of matrix-vector products per iteration by 1/3 (from 3 to 2) with little to no impact on the convergence speed.

Title: Random Modulation: Achieving Asymptotic Replica Optimality over Arbitrary Norm-Bounded and Spectrally Convergent Channel Matrices
Authors: Lei Liu, Yuhao Chi, Shunqi Huang
Abstract: This paper introduces a random modulation technique that is decoupled from the channel matrix, allowing it to be applied to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. The proposed random modulation constructs an equivalent dense and random channel matrix, ensuring that the signals undergo sufficient statistical channel fading. It also guarantees the asymptotic replica maximum a posteriori (MAP) bit-error rate (BER) optimality of approximate message passing (AMP)-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices when their state evolution has a unique fixed point. Then, a low-complexity cross-domain memory approximate message passing (CD-MAMP) detector is proposed for random modulation, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the random transform-domain channel. Furthermore, the optimal power allocation schemes are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random-modulated linear systems, assuming the availability of channel state information (CSI) at the transceiver. Numerical results show that the proposed random modulation can achieve BER and block-error rate (BLER) performance gains of up to 2 - 3 dB compared to existing OFDM/OTFS/AFDM with 5G-NR LDPC codes, under both average and optimized power allocation.

Abstract: Existing audio language models typically rely on task-specific fine-tuning to accomplish particular audio tasks. In contrast, humans are able to generalize to new audio tasks with only a few examples or simple instructions. GPT-3 has shown that scaling next-token prediction pretraining enables strong generalization capabilities in text, and we believe this paradigm is equally applicable to the audio domain. By scaling MiMo-Audio's pretraining data to over one hundred million of hours, we observe the emergence of few-shot learning capabilities across a diverse set of audio tasks. We develop a systematic evaluation of these capabilities and find that MiMo-Audio-7B-Base achieves SOTA performance on both speech intelligence and audio understanding benchmarks among open-source models. Beyond standard metrics, MiMo-Audio-7B-Base generalizes to tasks absent from its training data, such as voice conversion, style transfer, and speech editing. MiMo-Audio-7B-Base also demonstrates powerful speech continuation capabilities, capable of generating highly realistic talk shows, recitations, livestreaming and debates. At the post-training stage, we curate a diverse instruction-tuning corpus and introduce thinking mechanisms into both audio understanding and generation. MiMo-Audio-7B-Instruct achieves open-source SOTA on audio understanding benchmarks (MMSU, MMAU, MMAR, MMAU-Pro), spoken dialogue benchmarks (Big Bench Audio, MultiChallenge Audio) and instruct-TTS evaluations, approaching or surpassing closed-source models. Model checkpoints and full evaluation suite are available at this https URL.

Title: Continuous Angular Power Spectrum Recovery From Channel Covariance via Chebyshev Polynomials
Authors: Shengsong Luo, Ruilin Wu, Chongbin Xu, Junjie Ma, Xiaojun Yuan, Xin Wang
Abstract: This paper proposes a Chebyshev polynomial expansion framework for the recovery of a continuous angular power spectrum (APS) from channel covariance. By exploiting the orthogonality of Chebyshev polynomials in a transformed domain, we derive an exact series representation of the covariance and reformulate the inherently ill-posed APS inversion as a finite-dimensional linear regression problem via truncation. The associated approximation error is directly controlled by the tail of the APS's Chebyshev series and decays rapidly with increasing angular smoothness. Building on this representation, we derive an exact semidefinite characterization of nonnegative APS and introduce a derivative-based regularizer that promotes smoothly varying APS profiles while preserving transitions of clusters. Simulation results show that the proposed Chebyshev-based framework yields accurate APS reconstruction, and enables reliable downlink (DL) covariance prediction from uplink (UL) measurements in a frequency division duplex (FDD) setting. These findings indicate that jointly exploiting smoothness and nonnegativity in a Chebyshev domain provides an effective tool for covariance-domain processing in multi-antenna systems.

Title: Random Multiplexing
Authors: Lei Liu, Yuhao Chi, Shunqi Huang, Zhaoyang Zhang
Abstract: As wireless communication applications evolve from traditional multipath environments to high-mobility scenarios like unmanned aerial vehicles, multiplexing techniques have advanced accordingly. Traditional single-carrier frequency-domain equalization (SC-FDE) and orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) have given way to emerging orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) and affine frequency-division multiplexing (AFDM). These approaches exploit specific channel structures to diagonalize or sparsify the effective channel, thereby enabling low-complexity detection. However, their reliance on these structures significantly limits their robustness in dynamic, real-world environments. To address these challenges, this paper studies a random multiplexing technique that is decoupled from the physical channels, enabling its application to arbitrary norm-bounded and spectrally convergent channel matrices. Random multiplexing achieves statistical fading-channel ergodicity for transmitted signals by constructing an equivalent input-isotropic channel matrix in the random transform domain. It guarantees the asymptotic replica MAP bit-error rate (BER) optimality of AMP-type detectors for linear systems with arbitrary norm-bounded, spectrally convergent channel matrices and signaling configurations, under the unique fixed point assumption. A low-complexity cross-domain memory AMP (CD-MAMP) detector is considered, leveraging the sparsity of the time-domain channel and the randomness of the equivalent channel. Optimal power allocations are derived to minimize the replica MAP BER and maximize the replica constrained capacity of random multiplexing systems. The optimal coding principle and replica constrained-capacity optimality of CD-MAMP detector are investigated for random multiplexing systems. Additionally, the versatility of random multiplexing in diverse wireless applications is explored.

Authors: Manuel Bied, John Arockiasamy, Andy Comeca, Maximilian Schrapel, Victoria Yang, Alexey Rolich, Barbara Bruno, Maike Schwammberger, Dieter Fiems, Alexey Vinel
Abstract: On the way towards full autonomy, sharing roads between automated vehicles and human actors in so-called mixed traffic is unavoidable. Moreover, even if all vehicles on the road were autonomous, pedestrians would still be crossing the streets. We propose social robots as moderators between autonomous vehicles and vulnerable road users (VRU). To this end, we identify four enablers requiring integration: (1) advanced perception, allowing the robot to see the environment; (2) vehicular communications allowing connected vehicles to share intentions and the robot to send guiding commands; (3) social human-robot interaction allowing the robot to effectively communicate with VRUs and drivers; (4) formal specification allowing the robot to understand traffic and plan accordingly. This paper presents an overview of the key enablers and report on a first proof-of-concept integration of the first three enablers envisioning a social robot advising pedestrians in scenarios with a cooperative automated e-bike.

Title: Fast and Realistic Automated Scenario Simulations and Reporting for an Autonomous Racing Stack
Authors: Giovanni Lambertini, Matteo Pini, Eugenio Mascaro, Francesco Moretti, Ayoub Raji, Marko Bertogna
Abstract: In this paper, we describe the automated simulation and reporting pipeline implemented for our autonomous racing stack, this http URL. The backbone of the simulation is based on a high-fidelity model of the vehicle interfaced as a Functional Mockup Unit (FMU). The pipeline can execute the software stack and the simulation up to three times faster than real-time, locally or on GitHub for Continuous Integration/- Continuous Delivery (CI/CD). As the most important input of the pipeline, there is a set of running scenarios. Each scenario allows the initialization of the ego vehicle in different initial conditions (position and speed), as well as the initialization of any other configuration of the stack. This functionality is essential to validate efficiently critical modules, like the one responsible for high-speed overtaking maneuvers or localization, which are among the most challenging aspects of autonomous racing. Moreover, we describe how we implemented a fault injection module, capable of introducing sensor delays and perturbations as well as modifying outputs of any node of the stack. Finally, we describe the design of our automated reporting process, aimed at maximizing the effectiveness of the simulation analysis.

Title: Adaptive Learning Guided by Bias-Noise-Alignment Diagnostics
Authors: Akash Samanta, Sheldon Williamson
Abstract: Learning systems deployed in nonstationary and safety-critical environments often suffer from instability, slow convergence, or brittle adaptation when learning dynamics evolve over time. While modern optimization, reinforcement learning, and meta-learning methods adapt to gradient statistics, they largely ignore the temporal structure of the error signal itself. This paper proposes a diagnostic-driven adaptive learning framework that explicitly models error evolution through a principled decomposition into bias, capturing persistent drift; noise, capturing stochastic variability; and alignment, capturing repeated directional excitation leading to overshoot. These diagnostics are computed online from lightweight statistics of loss or temporal-difference error trajectories and are independent of model architecture or task domain. We show that the proposed bias-noise-alignment decomposition provides a unifying control backbone for supervised optimization, actor-critic reinforcement learning, and learned optimizers. Building on this framework, we derive diagnostic-driven instantiations including a stabilized supervised optimizer, a diagnostic-regulated actor-critic scheme, and a diagnostic-conditioned learned optimizer. Under standard smoothness assumptions, we establish bounded effective updates and stability properties for all cases. Representative diagnostic illustrations in actor-critic learning highlight how the proposed signals modulate adaptation in response to temporal-difference error structure. Overall, this work elevates error evolution to a first-class object in adaptive learning and provides an interpretable, lightweight foundation for reliable learning in dynamic environments.

Title: F2IDiff: Real-world Image Super-resolution using Feature to Image Diffusion Foundation Model
Authors: Devendra K. Jangid, Ripon K. Saha, Dilshan Godaliyadda, Jing Li, Seok-Jun Lee, Hamid R. Sheikh
Abstract: With the advent of Generative AI, Single Image Super-Resolution (SISR) quality has seen substantial improvement, as the strong priors learned by Text-2-Image Diffusion (T2IDiff) Foundation Models (FM) can bridge the gap between High-Resolution (HR) and Low-Resolution (LR) images. However, flagship smartphone cameras have been slow to adopt generative models because strong generation can lead to undesirable hallucinations. For substantially degraded LR images, as seen in academia, strong generation is required and hallucinations are more tolerable because of the wide gap between LR and HR images. In contrast, in consumer photography, the LR image has substantially higher fidelity, requiring only minimal hallucination-free generation. We hypothesize that generation in SISR is controlled by the stringency and richness of the FM's conditioning feature. First, text features are high level features, which often cannot describe subtle textures in an image. Additionally, Smartphone LR images are at least $12MP$, whereas SISR networks built on T2IDiff FM are designed to perform inference on much smaller images ($<1MP$). As a result, SISR inference has to be performed on small patches, which often cannot be accurately described by text feature. To address these shortcomings, we introduce an SISR network built on a FM with lower-level feature conditioning, specifically DINOv2 features, which we call a Feature-to-Image Diffusion (F2IDiff) Foundation Model (FM). Lower level features provide stricter conditioning while being rich descriptors of even small patches.

Title: CPR: Causal Physiological Representation Learning for Robust ECG Analysis under Distribution Shifts
Authors: Shunbo Jia, Caizhi Liao
Abstract: Deep learning models for Electrocardiogram (ECG) diagnosis have achieved remarkable accuracy but exhibit fragility against adversarial perturbations, particularly Smooth Adversarial Perturbations (SAP) that mimic biological morphology. Existing defenses face a critical dilemma: Adversarial Training (AT) provides robustness but incurs a prohibitive computational burden, while certified methods like Randomized Smoothing (RS) introduce significant inference latency, rendering them impractical for real-time clinical monitoring. We posit that this vulnerability stems from the models' reliance on non-robust spurious correlations rather than invariant pathological features. To address this, we propose Causal Physiological Representation Learning (CPR). Unlike standard denoising approaches that operate without semantic constraints, CPR incorporates a Physiological Structural Prior within a causal disentanglement framework. By modeling ECG generation via a Structural Causal Model (SCM), CPR enforces a structural intervention that strictly separates invariant pathological morphology (P-QRS-T complex) from non-causal artifacts. Empirical results on PTB-XL demonstrate that CPR significantly outperforms standard clinical preprocessing methods. Specifically, under SAP attacks, CPR achieves an F1 score of 0.632, surpassing Median Smoothing (0.541 F1) by 9.1%. Crucially, CPR matches the certified robustness of Randomized Smoothing while maintaining single-pass inference efficiency, offering a superior trade-off between robustness, efficiency, and clinical interpretability.

Title: VLA-RAIL: A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker for VLA Models and Robots
Authors: Yongsheng Zhao, Lei Zhao, Baoping Cheng, Gongxin Yao, Xuanzhang Wen, Han Gao
Abstract: Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have achieved remarkable breakthroughs in robotics, with the action chunk playing a dominant role in these advances. Given the real-time and continuous nature of robotic motion control, the strategies for fusing a queue of successive action chunks have a profound impact on the overall performance of VLA models. Existing methods suffer from jitter, stalling, or even pauses in robotic action execution, which not only limits the achievable execution speed but also reduces the overall success rate of task completion. This paper introduces VLA-RAIL (A Real-Time Asynchronous Inference Linker), a novel framework designed to address these issues by conducting model inference and robot motion control asynchronously and guaranteeing smooth, continuous, and high-speed action execution. The core contributions of the paper are two fold: a Trajectory Smoother that effectively filters out the noise and jitter in the trajectory of one action chunk using polynomial fitting and a Chunk Fuser that seamlessly align the current executing trajectory and the newly arrived chunk, ensuring position, velocity, and acceleration continuity between two successive action chunks. We validate the effectiveness of VLA-RAIL on a benchmark of dynamic simulation tasks and several real-world manipulation tasks. Experimental results demonstrate that VLA-RAIL significantly reduces motion jitter, enhances execution speed, and improves task success rates, which will become a key infrastructure for the large-scale deployment of VLA models.

Title: Multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis under unseen working conditions
Authors: Pengcheng Xia, Yixiang Huang, Chengjin Qin, Chengliang Liu
Abstract: Intelligent fault diagnosis has become an indispensable technique for ensuring machinery reliability. However, existing methods suffer significant performance decline in real-world scenarios where models are tested under unseen working conditions, while domain adaptation approaches are limited to their reliance on target domain samples. Moreover, most existing studies rely on single-modal sensing signals, overlooking the complementary nature of multi-modal information for improving model generalization. To address these limitations, this paper proposes a multi-modal cross-domain mixed fusion model with dual disentanglement for fault diagnosis. A dual disentanglement framework is developed to decouple modality-invariant and modality-specific features, as well as domain-invariant and domain-specific representations, enabling both comprehensive multi-modal representation learning and robust domain generalization. A cross-domain mixed fusion strategy is designed to randomly mix modality information across domains for modality and domain diversity augmentation. Furthermore, a triple-modal fusion mechanism is introduced to adaptively integrate multi-modal heterogeneous information. Extensive experiments are conducted on induction motor fault diagnosis under both unseen constant and time-varying working conditions. The results demonstrate that the proposed method consistently outperforms advanced methods and comprehensive ablation studies further verify the effectiveness of each proposed component and multi-modal fusion.

Title: BatteryAgent: Synergizing Physics-Informed Interpretation with LLM Reasoning for Intelligent Battery Fault Diagnosis
Authors: Songqi Zhou, Ruixue Liu, Boman Su, Jiazhou Wang, Yixing Wang, Benben Jiang
Abstract: Fault diagnosis of lithium-ion batteries is critical for system safety. While existing deep learning methods exhibit superior detection accuracy, their "black-box" nature hinders interpretability. Furthermore, restricted by binary classification paradigms, they struggle to provide root cause analysis and maintenance recommendations. To address these limitations, this paper proposes BatteryAgent, a hierarchical framework that integrates physical knowledge features with the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). The framework comprises three core modules: (1) A Physical Perception Layer that utilizes 10 mechanism-based features derived from electrochemical principles, balancing dimensionality reduction with physical fidelity; (2) A Detection and Attribution Layer that employs Gradient Boosting Decision Trees and SHAP to quantify feature contributions; and (3) A Reasoning and Diagnosis Layer that leverages an LLM as the agent core. This layer constructs a "numerical-semantic" bridge, combining SHAP attributions with a mechanism knowledge base to generate comprehensive reports containing fault types, root cause analysis, and maintenance suggestions. Experimental results demonstrate that BatteryAgent effectively corrects misclassifications on hard boundary samples, achieving an AUROC of 0.986, which significantly outperforms current state-of-the-art methods. Moreover, the framework extends traditional binary detection to multi-type interpretable diagnosis, offering a new paradigm shift from "passive detection" to "intelligent diagnosis" for battery safety management.

Title: Control of Microrobots with Reinforcement Learning under On-Device Compute Constraints
Authors: Yichen Liu, Kesava Viswanadha, Zhongyu Li, Nelson Lojo, Kristofer S. J. Pister
Abstract: An important function of autonomous microrobots is the ability to perform robust movement over terrain. This paper explores an edge ML approach to microrobot locomotion, allowing for on-device, lower latency control under compute, memory, and power constraints. This paper explores the locomotion of a sub-centimeter quadrupedal microrobot via reinforcement learning (RL) and deploys the resulting controller on an ultra-small system-on-chip (SoC), SC$\mu$M-3C, featuring an ARM Cortex-M0 microcontroller running at 5 MHz. We train a compact FP32 multilayer perceptron (MLP) policy with two hidden layers ($[128, 64]$) in a massively parallel GPU simulation and enhance robustness by utilizing domain randomization over simulation parameters. We then study integer (Int8) quantization (per-tensor and per-feature) to allow for higher inference update rates on our resource-limited hardware, and we connect hardware power budgets to achievable update frequency via a cycles-per-update model for inference on our Cortex-M0. We propose a resource-aware gait scheduling viewpoint: given a device power budget, we can select the gait mode (trot/intermediate/gallop) that maximizes expected RL reward at a corresponding feasible update frequency. Finally, we deploy our MLP policy on a real-world large-scale robot on uneven terrain, qualitatively noting that domain-randomized training can improve out-of-distribution stability. We do not claim real-world large-robot empirical zero-shot transfer in this work.

Title: Throughput Optimization in UAV-Mounted RIS under Jittering and Imperfect CSI via DRL
Authors: Anas K. Saeed, Mahmoud M. Salim, Ali Arshad Nasir, Ali H. Muqaibel
Abstract: Reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RISs) mounted on unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can reshape wireless propagation on-demand. However, their performance is sensitive to UAV jitter and cascaded channel uncertainty. This paper investigates a downlink multiple-input single-output UAV-mounted RIS system in which a ground multiple-antenna base station (BS) serves multiple single-antenna users under practical impairments. Our goal is to maximize the expected throughput under stochastic three-dimensional UAV jitter and imperfect cascaded channel state information (CSI) based only on the available channel estimates. This leads to a stochastic nonconvex optimization problem subject to a BS transmit power constraint and strict unit-modulus constraints on all RIS elements. To address this problem, we design a model-free deep reinforcement learning (DRL) framework with a contextual bandit formulation. A differentiable feasibility layer is utilized to map continuous actions to feasible solutions, while the reward is a Monte Carlo estimate of the expected throughput. We instantiate this framework with constrained variants of deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG) and twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradient (TD3) that do not use target networks. Simulations show that the proposed algorithms yield higher throughput than conventional alternating optimization-based weighted minimum mean-square error (AO-WMMSE) baselines under severe jitter and low CSI quality. Across different scenarios, the proposed methods achieve performance that is either comparable to or slightly below the AO-WMMSE benchmark, based on sample average approximation (SAA) with a relative gap ranging from 0-12%. Moreover, the proposed DRL controllers achieve online inference times of 0.6 ms per decision versus roughly 370-550 ms for AO-WMMSE solvers.

Title: Sidelink Positioning: Standardization Advancements, Challenges and Opportunities
Authors: Yuan Gao, Guangjin Pan, Zhiyong Zhong, Zhengyu Jin, Yichen Hu, Yifei Jin, Shugong Xu
Abstract: With the integration of cellular networks in vertical industries that demand precise location information, such as vehicle-to-everything (V2X), public safety, and Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT), positioning has become an imperative component for future wireless networks. By exploiting a wider spectrum, multiple antennas and flexible architectures, cellular positioning achieves ever-increasing positioning accuracy. Still, it faces fundamental performance degradation when the distance between user equipment (UE) and the base station (BS) is large or in non-line-of-sight (NLoS) scenarios. To this end, the 3rd generation partnership project (3GPP) Rel-18 proposes to standardize sidelink (SL) positioning, which provides unique opportunities to extend the positioning coverage via direct positioning signaling between UEs. Despite the standardization advancements, the capability of SL positioning is controversial, especially how much spectrum is required to achieve the positioning accuracy defined in 3GPP. To this end, this article summarizes the latest standardization advancements of 3GPP on SL positioning comprehensively, covering a) network architecture; b) positioning types; and c) performance requirements. The capability of SL positioning using various positioning methods under different imperfect factors is evaluated and discussed in-depth. Finally, according to the evolution of SL in 3GPP Rel-19, we discuss the possible research directions and challenges of SL positioning.

Title: MSACL: Multi-Step Actor-Critic Learning with Lyapunov Certificates for Exponentially Stabilizing Control
Authors: Yongwei Zhang, Yuanzhe Xing, Quan Quan, Zhikun She
Abstract: Achieving provable stability in model-free reinforcement learning (RL) remains a challenge, particularly in balancing exploration with rigorous safety. This article introduces MSACL, a framework that integrates exponential stability theory with maximum entropy RL through multi-step Lyapunov certificate learning. Unlike methods relying on complex reward engineering, MSACL utilizes off-policy multi-step data to learn Lyapunov certificates satisfying theoretical stability conditions. By introducing Exponential Stability Labels (ESL) and a $\lambda$-weighted aggregation mechanism, the framework effectively balances the bias-variance trade-off in multi-step learning. Policy optimization is guided by a stability-aware advantage function, ensuring the learned policy promotes rapid Lyapunov descent. We evaluate MSACL across six benchmarks, including stabilization and nonlinear tracking tasks, demonstrating its superiority over state-of-the-art Lyapunov-based RL algorithms. MSACL achieves exponential stability and rapid convergence under simple rewards, while exhibiting significant robustness to uncertainties and generalization to unseen trajectories. Sensitivity analysis establishes the multi-step horizon $n=20$ as a robust default across diverse systems. By linking Lyapunov theory with off-policy actor-critic frameworks, MSACL provides a foundation for verifiably safe learning-based control. Source code and benchmark environments will be made publicly available.

Title: A Close Examination of the Multipath Propagation Stochastic Model for Communications over Power Lines
Authors: José A. Cortés, Alberto Pittolo, Irene Povedano, Francisco J. Cañete, Andrea M. Tonello
Abstract: This paper focuses on the parameterization of the multipath propagation model (MPM) for indoor broadband power line communications (PLC), which up to now has been established in an heuristic way. The MPM model was initially proposed in the PLC context for outdoor channels in the band up to 20 MHz, but its number of parameters becomes extremely large when used to model indoor channel frequency responses (CFR), which are much more frequency-selective than outdoor ones, and the band is extended to 80 MHz. This work proposes a fitting procedure that addresses this problem. It allows determining the model parameters that yield the best fit to each channel of a large database of single-input single-output (SISO) experimental measurements acquired in typical home premises of different European countries. Then, the statistics of the MPM parameters are analyzed. The study unveils the relation between the model parameters and the main characteristics of the actual CFR like the frequency selectivity and the average attenuation. It also estimates the probability density function (PDF) of each parameter and proposes a fitting distribution for each of them. Moreover, the relationship among the main parameters of the model, as well as their impact on the performance of PLC communication systems are also explored. Provided results can be helpful for the development of MPM-based models for indoor broadband PLC.

Title: Myopically Verifiable Probabilistic Certificates for Safe Control and Learning
Authors: Zhuoyuan Wang, Haoming Jing, Christian Kurniawan, Albert Chern, Yorie Nakahira
Abstract: This paper addresses the design of safety certificates for stochastic systems, with a focus on ensuring long-term safety through fast real-time control. In stochastic environments, set invariance-based methods that restrict the probability of risk events in infinitesimal time intervals may exhibit significant long-term risks due to cumulative uncertainties/risks. On the other hand, reachability-based approaches that account for the long-term future may require prohibitive computation in real-time decision making. To overcome this challenge involving stringent long-term safety vs. computation tradeoffs, we first introduce a novel technique termed `probabilistic invariance'. This technique characterizes the invariance conditions of the probability of interest. When the target probability is defined using long-term trajectories, this technique can be used to design myopic conditions/controllers with assured long-term safe probability. Then, we integrate this technique into safe control and learning. The proposed control methods efficiently assure long-term safety using neural networks or model predictive controllers with short outlook horizons. The proposed learning methods can be used to guarantee long-term safety during and after training. Finally, we demonstrate the performance of the proposed techniques in numerical simulations.

Title: Regularized autoregressive modeling and its application to audio signal reconstruction
Authors: Ondřej Mokrý, Pavel Rajmic
Abstract: Autoregressive (AR) modeling is invaluable in signal processing, in particular in speech and audio fields. Attempts in the literature can be found that regularize or constrain either the time-domain signal values or the AR coefficients, which is done for various reasons, including the incorporation of prior information or numerical stabilization. Although these attempts are appealing, an encompassing and generic modeling framework is still missing. We propose such a framework and the related optimization problem and algorithm. We discuss the computational demands of the algorithm and explore the effects of various improvements on its convergence speed. In the experimental part, we demonstrate the usefulness of our approach on the audio declipping and dequantization problems. We compare its performance against state-of-the-art methods and demonstrate the competitiveness of the proposed method in declipping musical signals, and its superiority in declipping speech. The evaluation includes a heuristic algorithm of generalized linear prediction (GLP), a strong competitor which has only been presented as a patent and is new in the scientific community.

Title: Two-Stage Robust Optimal Operation of Distribution Networks Considering Renewable Energy and Demand Asymmetric Uncertainties
Authors: Zhisheng Xiong, Bo Zeng, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara
Abstract: This paper presents a confidence level-based distributionally information gap decision theory (CL-DIGDT) framework for the two-stage robust optimal operation of distribution networks, aiming at deriving an optimal operational scheme capable of addressing asymmetric uncertainties related to renewable energy and load demands. Building on conventional IGDT, the proposed framework utilizes the confidence level to capture the asymmetric characteristics of uncertainties and maximize the risk-averse capability of the solution in a probabilistic manner. To account for the probabilistic consideration, the imprecise Dirichlet model is employed to construct the ambiguity sets of uncertainties, reducing reliance on precise probability distributions. Consequently, a two-stage robust optimal operation model for distribution networks using CL-DIGDT is developed. An iterative method is proposed to solve the model and determine the upper and lower bounds of the objective function. Case study demonstrates that the proposed approach yields a more robust and statistically optimized solution with required accuracy compared to existing method, contributing to a reduction in first-stage cost by 0.84%, second-stage average cost by 6.7%, and significantly increasing the reliability of the solution by 8%.

Kevin Zhou, Qiyong Cao, Chunpeng Zhao, Xinbao Wu, Yu Wang
Abstract: The segmentation of pelvic fracture fragments in CT and X-ray images is crucial for trauma diagnosis, surgical planning, and intraoperative guidance. However, accurately and efficiently delineating the bone fragments remains a significant challenge due to complex anatomy and imaging limitations. The PENGWIN challenge, organized as a MICCAI 2024 satellite event, aimed to advance automated fracture segmentation by benchmarking state-of-the-art algorithms on these complex tasks. A diverse dataset of 150 CT scans was collected from multiple clinical centers, and a large set of simulated X-ray images was generated using the DeepDRR method. Final submissions from 16 teams worldwide were evaluated under a rigorous multi-metric testing scheme. The top-performing CT algorithm achieved an average fragment-wise intersection over union (IoU) of 0.930, demonstrating satisfactory accuracy. However, in the X-ray task, the best algorithm achieved an IoU of 0.774, which is promising but not yet sufficient for intra-operative decision-making, reflecting the inherent challenges of fragment overlap in projection imaging. Beyond the quantitative evaluation, the challenge revealed methodological diversity in algorithm design. Variations in instance representation, such as primary-secondary classification versus boundary-core separation, led to differing segmentation strategies. Despite promising results, the challenge also exposed inherent uncertainties in fragment definition, particularly in cases of incomplete fractures. These findings suggest that interactive segmentation approaches, integrating human decision-making with task-relevant information, may be essential for improving model reliability and clinical applicability.

Authors: Qianglong Dai, Yong Zeng, Huizhi Wang, Changsheng You, Chao Zhou, Hongqiang Cheng, Xiaoli Xu, Shi Jin, A. Lee Swindlehurst, Yonina C. Eldar, Robert Schober, Rui Zhang, Xiaohu You
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) is one of the key usage scenarios for future sixth-generation (6G) mobile communication networks, where communication and sensing (C&S) services are simultaneously provided through shared wireless spectrum, signal processing modules, hardware, and network infrastructure. Such an integration is strengthened by the technology trends in 6G, such as denser network nodes, larger antenna arrays, wider bandwidths, higher frequency bands, and more efficient utilization of spectrum and hardware resources, which incentivize and empower enhanced sensing capabilities. As the dominant waveform used in contemporary communication systems, orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) is still expected to be a very competitive technology for 6G, rendering it necessary to thoroughly investigate the potential and challenges of OFDM ISAC. Thus, this paper aims to provide a comprehensive tutorial overview of ISAC systems enabled by large-scale multi-input multi-output (MIMO) and OFDM technologies and to discuss their fundamental principles, advantages, and enabling signal processing methods. To this end, a unified MIMO-OFDM ISAC system model is first introduced, followed by four frameworks for estimating parameters across the spatial, delay, and Doppler domains, including parallel one-domain, sequential one-domain, joint two-domain, and joint three-domain parameter estimation. Next, sensing algorithms and performance analyses are presented in detail for far-field scenarios where uniform plane wave (UPW) propagation is valid, followed by their extensions to near-field scenarios where uniform spherical wave (USW) characteristics need to be considered. Finally, this paper points out open challenges and outlines promising avenues for future research on MIMO-OFDM ISAC.

Title: Hybrid Learning: A Novel Combination of Self-Supervised and Supervised Learning for Joint MRI Reconstruction and Denoising in Low-Field MRI
Authors: Haoyang Pei, Nikola Janjuvsevic, Renqing Luo, Ding Xia, Xiang Xu, William Moore, Yao Wang, Hersh Chandarana, Li Feng
Abstract: Deep learning has demonstrated strong potential for MRI reconstruction. However, conventional supervised learning requires high-quality, high-SNR references for network training, which are often difficult or impossible to obtain in different scenarios, particularly in low-field MRI. Self-supervised learning provides an alternative by removing the need for training references, but its reconstruction performance can degrade when the baseline SNR is low. To address these limitations, we propose hybrid learning, a two-stage training framework that integrates self-supervised and supervised learning for joint MRI reconstruction and denoising when only low-SNR training references are available. Hybrid learning is implemented in two sequential stages. In the first stage, self-supervised learning is applied to fully sampled low-SNR data to generate higher-quality pseudo-references. In the second stage, these pseudo-references are used as targets for supervised learning to reconstruct and denoise undersampled noisy data. The proposed technique was evaluated in multiple experiments involving simulated and real low-field MRI in the lung and brain at different field strengths. Hybrid learning consistently improved image quality over both standard self-supervised learning and supervised learning with noisy training references at different acceleration rates, noise levels, and field strengths, achieving higher SSIM and lower NMSE. The hybrid learning approach is effective for both Cartesian and non-Cartesian acquisitions. Hybrid learning provides an effective solution for training deep MRI reconstruction models in the absence of high-SNR references. By improving image quality in low-SNR settings, particularly for low-field MRI, it holds promise for broader clinical adoption of deep learning-based reconstruction methods.

Title: Algorithms for Nonlinear Mixed-Integer Location Estimation
Authors: Ophir Uziel, Efi Fogel, Dan Halperin, Sivan Toledo
Abstract: For three decades, carrier-phase observations have been used to obtain the most accurate location estimates using global navigation satellite systems (GNSS). These estimates are computed by minimizing a nonlinear mixed-integer least-squares problem. Existing algorithms linearize the problem, orthogonally project it to eliminate real variables, and then solve the integer least-square problem. There is now considerable interest in developing similar localization techniques for terrestrial and indoor settings. We show that algorithms that linearize first fail in these settings and we propose several algorithms for computing the estimates. Some of our algorithms are elimination algorithms that start by eliminating the non-linear terms in the constraints; others construct a geometric arrangement that allows us to efficiently enumerate integer solutions (in polynomial time). We focus on simplified localization problems in which the measurements are range (distance) measurements and carrier phase range measurements, with no nuisance parameters. The simplified problem allows us to focus on the core question of untangling the nonlinearity and the integer nature of some parameters. We show using simulations that the new algorithms are effective at close ranges at which the linearize-first approach fails.

Title: Frequency-switching Array Enhanced Physical-Layer Security in Terahertz Bands: A Movable Antenna Perspective
Authors: Cong Zhou, Changsheng You, Chao Zhou, Weidong Mei, Zhi Chen, Chengwen Xing, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new frequency-switching array (FSA) to enhance the physical-layer security (PLS) in the presence of multiple eavesdroppers (Eves), where the carrier frequency can be flexibly switched and small frequency offsets can be imposed on each antenna at the secrecy transmitter (Alice).First, we analytically show that by flexibly controlling the carrier frequency parameters, FSAs can effectively form uniform/non-uniform sparse arrays, hence resembling existing mechanically controlled movable antennas (MAs) via the control of inter-antenna spacing and providing additional degree-of-freedom in the beam this http URL the proposed FSA suffers from additional path-gain attenuation in the received signals, it can overcome several hardware and signal processing issues incurred by MAs, such as limited positioning accuracy, extra hardware and energy this http URL, a secrecy-rate maximization problem is formulated under the constraints on the frequency this http URL shed useful insights, we first consider a secrecy-guaranteed problem with a null-steering constraint for which maximum ratio transmission beamformer is considered at Alice and the frequency offsets are set as uniform frequency this http URL, it is shown that the proposed FSA can flexibly realize null-steering over Eve in both the angular domain and range domain, thereby achieving improved PLS this http URL, for the general case, we propose an efficient algorithm to solve the formulated non-convex optimization problem by using the block coordinate descent and projected gradient ascent techniques. Finally, numerical results demonstrate that the proposed FSA achieves superior secrecy rate performance over conventional fixed-position array, while it only suffers a slight secrecy rate loss than the existing mechanically controlled MA.

Title: An Efficient Detector for Faulty GNSS Measurements Detection With Non-Gaussian Noises
Authors: Penggao Yan, Baoshan Song, Xiao Xia, Weisong Wen, Li-Ta Hsu
Abstract: Fault detection is crucial to ensure the reliability of navigation systems. However, mainstream fault detection methods are developed based on Gaussian assumptions on nominal errors, while current attempts at non-Gaussian fault detection are either heuristic or lack rigorous statistical properties. The performance and reliability of these methods are challenged in real-world applications. This paper proposes the jackknife detector, a fault detection method tailored for linearized pseudorange-based positioning systems under non-Gaussian nominal errors. Specifically, by leveraging the jackknife technique, a test statistic is derived as a linear combination of measurement errors, eliminating the need for restrictive distributional assumptions while maintaining computational efficiency. A hypothesis test with the Bonferroni correction is then constructed to detect potential faults in measurements. Theoretical analysis proves the equivalence between the jackknife detector and the solution separation (SS) detector, while revealing the former's superior computational efficiency. Through a worldwide simulation and a real-world satellite clock anomaly detection experiment--both involving non-Gaussian nominal errors--the proposed jackknife detector demonstrates equivalent detection performance to the SS detector but achieves a fourfold improvement in computational efficiency. These results highlight the jackknife detector's substantial potential for real-time applications requiring robust and efficient fault detection in non-Gaussian noise environments.

Title: Efficient Artifacts Removal for Adaptive Deep Brain Stimulation and a Temporal Event Localization Analysis
Authors: Tzu-Chi Liu, Po-Lin Chen, Yi-Chieh Chen, Po-Hsun Tu, Chih-Hua Yeh, Mun-Chun Yeap, Chiung-Chu Chen, Hau-Tieng Wu
Abstract: Adaptive deep brain stimulation (aDBS) leverages symptom-related biomarkers to deliver personalized neuromodulation therapy, with the potential to improve treatment efficacy and reduce power consumption compared to conventional DBS. However, stimulation-induced signal contamination remains a major technical barrier to advancing its clinical application. Existing artifact removal strategies, both front-end and back-end, face trade-offs between artifact suppression and algorithmic flexibility. Among back-end algorithms, Shrinkage and Manifold-based Artifact Removal using Template Adaptation (SMARTA) has shown promising performance in mitigating stimulus artifacts with minimal distortion to local field potentials (LFPs), but its high computational demand and inability to handle transient direct current (DC) artifacts limit its use in real-time applications. To address this, we developed SMARTA+, a computationally efficient extension of SMARTA capable of suppressing both stimulus and transient DC artifacts while supporting flexible algorithmic design. We evaluated SMARTA+ using semi-real aDBS data and real data from Parkinson's disease patients. Compared to SMARTA and other established methods, SMARTA+ achieved comparable or superior artifact removal while significantly reducing computation time. It preserved spectral and temporal structures, ranging from beta band to high-frequency oscillations, and demonstrated robustness across diverse stimulation protocols. Temporal event localization analysis further showed improved accuracy in detecting beta bursts. These findings support SMARTA+ as a promising tool for advancing real-time, closed-loop aDBS systems.

Title: Pinching Antenna Systems for Integrated Sensing and Communications
Authors: Haochen Li, Ruikang Zhong, Jiayi Lei, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: Recently, the pinching antenna system (PASS) has attracted considerable attention due to their advantages in flexible deployment and reduction of signal propagation loss. In this work, a multiple waveguide PASS assisted integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system is proposed, where the base station (BS) is equipped with transmitting pinching antennas (PAs) and receiving uniform linear array (ULA) antennas. The full-duplex (FD) BS transmits the communication and sensing signals through the PAs on waveguides and collects the echo sensing signals with the mounted ULA. Based on this configuration, a target sensing Cramer Rao Bound (CRB) minimization problem is formulated under communication quality-of-service (QoS) constraints, power budget constraint, and PA deployment constraints. The alternating optimization (AO) method is employed to address the formulated non-convex optimization problem. In each iteration, the overall optimization problem is decomposed into a digital beamforming sub-problem and a pinching beamforming sub-problem. The sensing covariance matrix and communication beamforming matrix at the BS are optimized by solving the digital beamforming sub-problem with semidefinite relaxation (SDR). The PA deployment is updated by solving the pinching beamforming sub-problem with the successive convex approximation (SCA) method, penalty method, and element-wise optimization. Simulation results show that the proposed PASS assisted ISAC framework achieves superior performance over benchmark schemes, is less affected by stringent communication constraints compared to conventional MIMO-ISAC, and benefits further from increasing the number of waveguides and PAs per waveguide.

Title: Dual-IRS Aided Near-/Hybrid-Field SWIPT: Passive Beamforming and Independent Antenna Power Splitting Design
Authors: Chaoying Huang, Wen Chen, Qingqing Wu, Xusheng Zhu, Zhendong Li, Ying Wang, Jinhong Yuan
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel dual-intelligent reflecting surface (IRS) aided interference-limited simultaneous wireless information and power transfer (SWIPT) system with independent power splitting (PS), where each receiving antenna applies different PS factors to offer an advantageous trade-off between the useful information and harvested energy. We separately establish the near- and hybrid-field channel models for IRS-reflected links to evaluate the performance gain more precisely and practically. Specifically, we formulate an optimization problem of maximizing the harvested power by jointly optimizing dual-IRS phase shifts, independent PS ratio, and receive beamforming vector in both near- and hybrid-field cases. In the near-field case, the alternating optimization algorithm is proposed to solve the non-convex problem by applying the Lagrange duality method and the difference-of-convex (DC) programming. In the hybrid-field case, we first present an interesting result that the AP-IRS-user channel gains are invariant to the phase shifts of dual-IRS, which allows the optimization problem to be transformed into a convex one. Then, we derive the asymptotic performance of the combined channel gains in closed-form and analyze the characteristics of the dual-IRS. Numerical results validate our analysis and indicate the performance gains of the proposed scheme that dual-IRS-aided SWIPT with independent PS over other benchmark schemes.

Title: Hybrid dynamical systems modeling of power systems
Authors: B.G. Odunlami, M. Netto, Y. Susuki
Abstract: The increasing integration of renewable energy sources has introduced complex dynamic behavior in power systems that challenge the adequacy of traditional continuous-time modeling approaches. These developments call for modeling frameworks that can capture the intricate interplay between continuous dynamics and discrete events characterizing modern grid operations. Hybrid dynamical systems offer a rigorous foundation for representing such mixed dynamics and have emerged as a valuable tool in power system analysis. Despite their potential, existing studies remain focused on isolated applications or case-specific implementations, offering limited generalizability and guidance for model selection. This paper addresses that gap by providing a comprehensive overview of hybrid modeling approaches relevant to power systems. It critically examines key formalisms, including hybrid automata, switched systems, and piecewise affine models, evaluating their respective strengths, limitations, and suitability across control, stability, and system design tasks. In doing so, the paper identifies open challenges and outlines future research directions to support the systematic application of hybrid methods in renewable-rich, converter-dominated power systems

Title: Time-Modulated Intelligent Reflecting Surfaces for Integrated Sensing, Communication and Security: A Generative AI Design Framework
Authors: Zhihao Tao, Athina Petropulu, H. Vincent Poor
Abstract: We propose a novel approach to achieve physical layer security for integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) systems operating in the presence of targets that may be eavesdroppers. The system is aided by a time-modulated intelligent reflecting surface (TM-IRS), which is configured to preserve the integrity of the transmitted data at one or more legitimate communication users (CUs) while making them appear scrambled in all other directions. The TM-IRS design leverages a generative flow network (GFlowNet) framework to learn a stochastic policy that samples high-performing TM-IRS configurations from a vast discrete parameter space. Specifically, we begin by formulating the achievable sum rate for the legitimate CUs and the beampattern gain toward the target direction, based on which we construct reward functions for GFlowNets that jointly capture both communication and sensing performance. The TM-IRS design is modeled as a deterministic Markov decision process (MDP), where each terminal state corresponds to a complete configuration of TM-IRS parameters. GFlowNets, parametrized by deep neural networks are employed to learn a stochastic policy that samples TM-IRS parameter sets with probability proportional to their associated reward. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed GFlowNet-based method in integrating sensing, communication and security simultaneously, and also exhibit significant sampling efficiency as compared to the exhaustive combinatorial search and enhanced robustness against the existing benchmarks of physical layer security.

Title: GroundGazer: Camera-based indoor localization of mobile robots with millimeter accuracy at low cost
Authors: Sven Hinderer, Jakob Hüsken, Bohan Sun, Bin Yang
Abstract: Highly accurate indoor localization systems with mm positioning accuracy are currently very expensive. They include range finders (such as LiDAR), tachymeters, and motion capture systems relying on multiple high-end cameras. In this work, we introduce a high-accuracy, planar indoor localization system named GroundGazer (GG) for autonomous mobile robots (AMRs). GG estimates the AMR's position with mm and its heading with sub-degree accuracy. The system requires only a monocular (fisheye) camera, a chessboard floor, and an optional laser diode. Our system is simple and low-cost, easy to set up, portable, robust, scalable to large areas and robot swarms, and potentially extendable to 3D position and orientation estimation.

Title: Fast, Differentiable, GPU-Accelerated Ray Tracing for Multiple Diffraction and Reflection Paths
Authors: Jérome Eertmans, Sophie Lequeu, Benoît Legat, Laurent Jacques, Claude Oestges
Abstract: We present a fast, differentiable, GPU-accelerated optimization method for ray path tracing in environments containing planar reflectors and straight diffraction edges. Based on Fermat's principle, our approach reformulates the path-finding problem as the minimization of total path length, enabling efficient parallel execution on modern GPU architectures. Unlike existing methods that require separate algorithms for reflections and diffractions, our unified formulation maintains consistent problem dimensions across all interaction sequences, making it particularly suitable for vectorized computation. Through implicit differentiation, we achieve efficient gradient computation without differentiating through solver iterations, significantly outperforming traditional automatic differentiation approaches. Numerical simulations demonstrate convergence rates comparable to specialized Newton methods while providing superior scalability for large-scale applications. The method integrates seamlessly with differentiable programming libraries such as JAX and DrJIT, enabling new possibilities in inverse design and optimization for wireless propagation modeling.

Title: Agentic AI Systems in Electrical Power Systems Engineering: Current State-of-the-Art and Challenges
Authors: Soham Ghosh, Gaurav Mittal
Abstract: Agentic AI systems have recently emerged as a critical and transformative approach in artificial intelligence, offering capabilities that extend far beyond traditional AI agents and contemporary generative AI models. This rapid evolution necessitates a clear conceptual and taxonomical understanding to differentiate this new paradigm. Our paper addresses this gap by providing a comprehensive review that establishes a precise definition and taxonomy for "agentic AI," with the aim of distinguishing it from previous AI paradigms. The concepts are gradually introduced, starting with a highlight of its diverse applications across the broader field of engineering. The paper then presents four detailed, state-of-the-art use case applications specifically within electrical engineering. These case studies demonstrate practical impact, ranging from an advanced agentic framework for streamlining complex power system studies and benchmarking to a novel system developed for survival analysis of dynamic pricing strategies in battery swapping stations. Finally, to ensure robust deployment, the paper provides detailed failure mode investigations. From these findings, we derive actionable recommendations for the design and implementation of safe, reliable, and accountable agentic AI systems, offering a critical resource for researchers and practitioners.

Title: Single-View Tomographic Reconstruction Using Learned Primal Dual
Authors: Sean Breckling, Matthew Swan, Keith D. Tan, Derek Wingard, Brandon Baldonado, Yoohwan Kim, Ju-Yeon Jo, Evan Scott, Jordan Pillow
Abstract: The Learned Primal Dual (LPD) method has shown promising results in various tomographic reconstruction modalities, particularly under challenging acquisition restrictions such as limited viewing angles or a limited number of views. We investigate the performance of LPD in a more extreme case: single-view tomographic reconstructions of axially-symmetric targets. This study considers two modalities: the first assumes low-divergence or parallel X-rays. The second models a cone-beam X-ray imaging testbed. For both modalities, training data is generated using closed-form integral transforms, or physics-based ray-tracing software, then corrupted with blur and noise. Our results are then compared against common numerical inversion methodologies.

Title: Simultaneous Source Separation, Synchronization, Localization and Mapping for 6G Systems
Authors: Alexander Venus, Erik Leitinger, Klaus Witrisal
Abstract: Multipath-based simultaneous localization and mapping (MP-SLAM) is a promising approach for future 6G networks to jointly estimate the positions of transmitters and receivers together with the propagation environment. In cooperative MP-SLAM, information collected by multiple mobile terminals (MTs) is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness. Existing methods, however, typically assume perfectly synchronized base stations (BSs) and orthogonal transmission sequences, rendering inter-BS interference at the MTs negligible. In this work, we relax these assumptions and address simultaneous source separation, synchronization, and mapping. A relevant example arises in modern 5G systems, where BSs employ muting patterns to mitigate interference, yet localization performance still degrades. We propose a novel BS-dependent data association and synchronization bias model, integrated into a joint Bayesian framework and inferred via the sum-product algorithm on a factor graph. The impact of joint synchronization and source separation is analyzed under various system configurations. Compared with state-of-the-art cooperative MP-SLAM assuming orthogonal and synchronized BSs, our statistical analysis shows no significant performance degradation. The proposed BS-dependent data association model constitutes a principled approach for classifying features by arbitrary properties, such as reflection order or feature type (scatterers versus walls).

Title: Effective Online Exam Proctoring by Combining Lightweight Face Detection and Deep Recognition
Authors: Xu Yang, Juantao Zhong, Daoyuan Wu, Xiao Yi, Jimmy H. M. Lee, Tan Lee, Peng Han
Abstract: Online exams conducted via video conferencing platforms such as Zoom have become widespread, yet ensuring exam integrity remains challenging due to the difficulty of monitoring multiple video feeds in real time. We present iExam, an online exam proctoring and analysis system that combines lightweight real-time face detection with deep face recognition for postexam analysis. iExam assists invigilators by monitoring student presence during exams and identifies abnormal behaviors, such as face disappearance, face rotation, and identity substitution, from recorded videos. The system addresses three key challenges: (i)efficient real-time video capture and analysis, (ii) automated student identity labeling using enhanced OCR on dynamic Zoom name tags, and (iii) resource-efficient training and inference on standard teacher devices. Extensive experiments show that iExam achieves 90.4% accuracy in real-time face detection and 98.4% accuracy in post-exam recognition with low overhead, demonstrating its practicality and effectiveness for online exam proctoring.

Title: The Power of Preconditioning in Overparameterized Low-Rank Matrix Sensing
Authors: Xingyu Xu, Yandi Shen, Yuejie Chi, Cong Ma
Abstract: We propose $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$, a preconditioned gradient descent method to tackle the low-rank matrix sensing problem when the true rank is unknown, and when the matrix is possibly ill-conditioned. Using overparametrized factor representations, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ starts from a small random initialization, and proceeds by gradient descent with a specific form of damped preconditioning to combat bad curvatures induced by overparameterization and ill-conditioning. At the expense of light computational overhead incurred by preconditioners, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ is remarkably robust to ill-conditioning compared to vanilla gradient descent ($\textsf{GD}$) even with overprameterization. Specifically, we show that, under the Gaussian design, $\textsf{ScaledGD($\lambda$)}$ converges to the true low-rank matrix at a constant linear rate after a small number of iterations that scales only logarithmically with respect to the condition number and the problem dimension. This significantly improves over the convergence rate of vanilla $\textsf{GD}$ which suffers from a polynomial dependency on the condition number. Our work provides evidence on the power of preconditioning in accelerating the convergence without hurting generalization in overparameterized learning.

Title: HIDFlowNet: A Flow-Based Deep Network for Hyperspectral Image Denoising
Authors: Qizhou Wang, Li Pang, Xiangyong Cao, Zhiqiang Tian, Deyu Meng
Abstract: Hyperspectral image (HSI) denoising is essentially ill-posed since a noisy HSI can be degraded from multiple clean HSIs. However, existing deep learning (DL)-based approaches only restore one clean HSI from the given noisy HSI with a deterministic mapping, thus ignoring the ill-posed issue and always resulting in an over-smoothing problem. Additionally, these DL-based methods often neglect that noise is part of the high-frequency component and their network architectures fail to decouple the learning of low-frequency and high-frequency. To alleviate these issues, this paper proposes a flow-based HSI denoising network (HIDFlowNet) to directly learn the conditional distribution of the clean HSI given the noisy HSI and thus diverse clean HSIs can be sampled from the conditional distribution. Overall, our HIDFlowNet is induced from the generative flow model and is comprised of an invertible decoder and a conditional encoder, which can explicitly decouple the learning of low-frequency and high-frequency information of HSI. Specifically, the invertible decoder is built by staking a succession of invertible conditional blocks (ICBs) to capture the local high-frequency details. The conditional encoder utilizes down-sampling operations to obtain low-resolution images and uses transformers to capture correlations over a long distance so that global low-frequency information can be effectively extracted. Extensive experiments on simulated and real HSI datasets verify that our proposed HIDFlowNet can obtain better or comparable results compared with other state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Ricci-Notation Tensor Framework for Model-based Approaches to Imaging
Authors: Dileepan Joseph (Electrical and Computer Engineering, University of Alberta)
Abstract: Model-based approaches to imaging, like specialized image enhancements in astronomy, facilitate explanations of relationships between observed inputs and computed outputs. These models may be expressed with extended matrix-vector (EMV) algebra, especially when they involve only scalars, vectors, and matrices, and with n-mode or index notations, when they involve multidimensional arrays, also called numeric tensors or, simply, tensors. While this paper features an example, inspired by exoplanet imaging, that employs tensors to reveal (inverse) 2D fast Fourier transforms in an image enhancement model, the work is actually about the tensor algebra and software, or tensor frameworks, available for model-based imaging. The paper proposes a Ricci-notation tensor (RT) framework, comprising a dual-variant index notation, with Einstein summation convention, and codesigned object-oriented software, called the RTToolbox for MATLAB. Extensions to Ricci notation offer novel representations for entrywise, pagewise, and broadcasting operations popular in EMV frameworks for imaging. Complementing the EMV algebra computable with MATLAB, the RTToolbox demonstrates programmatic and computational efficiency via careful design of numeric tensor and dual-variant index classes. Compared to its closest competitor, also a numeric tensor framework that uses index notation, the RT framework enables superior ways to model imaging problems and, thereby, to develop solutions.

Title: Photon Absorption Remote Sensing Virtual Histopathology: A Preliminary Exploration of Diagnostic Equivalence to Gold-Standard H&E Staining in Skin Cancer Excisional Biopsies
Authors: Benjamin R. Ecclestone, James E. D. Tweel, Marie Abi Daoud, Hager Gaouda, Deepak Dinakaran, Michael P. Wallace, Ally Khan Somani, Gilbert Bigras, John R. Mackey, Parsin Haji Reza
Abstract: Photon Absorption Remote Sensing (PARS) enables label-free imaging of subcellular morphology by observing biomolecule specific absorption interactions. Coupled with deep-learning, PARS produces label-free virtual Hematoxylin and Eosin (H&E) stained images in unprocessed tissues. This study evaluates the diagnostic performance of PARS virtual H&E images in excisional skin biopsies, including Squamous (SCC), Basal (BCC) Cell Carcinoma, and normal skin. Sixteen unstained formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded skin excisions were PARS imaged, virtually H&E stained, then chemically stained and imaged at 40x. Seven fellowship trained dermatopathologists assessed all images. Example PARS and chemical H&E whole-slide images from this study are available at the BioImage Archive (this https URL). Concordance analysis indicates 95.5% agreement between primary diagnoses from PARS versus H&E images (Cohen's k=0.93). Inter-rater reliability was near-perfect for both image types (Fleiss' k=0.89 for PARS, k=0.80 for H&E). For subtype classification, agreement was near-perfect 91% (k=0.73) for SCC and was perfect for BCC. For malignancy confinement (e.g., cancer margins), agreement was 92% between PARS and H&E (k=0.718). During assessment dermatopathologists could not reliably distinguish image origin (PARS vs. H&E), and diagnostic confidence was equivalent. Inter-rater reliability for PARS virtual H&E was consistent with reported histologic evaluation benchmarks. These results indicate that PARS virtual histology may be diagnostically equivalent to chemical H&E staining in dermatopathology diagnostics, while enabling assessment directly from unlabeled slides. In turn, the label-free PARS virtual H&E imaging workflow may preserve tissue for downstream analysis while producing data well-suited for AI integration potentially accelerating and enhancing skin cancer diagnostics.

Title: Zoomer: Adaptive Image Focus Optimization for Black-box MLLM

Abstract: Multimodal large language models (MLLMs) such as GPT-4o, Gemini Pro, and Claude 3.5 have enabled unified reasoning over text and visual inputs, yet they often hallucinate in real world scenarios especially when small objects or fine spatial context are involved. We pinpoint two core causes of this failure: the absence of region-adaptive attention and inflexible token budgets that force uniform downsampling, leading to critical information loss. To overcome these limitations, we introduce Zoomer, a visual prompting framework that delivers token-efficient, detail-preserving image representations for black-box MLLMs. Zoomer integrates (1) a prompt-aware emphasis module to highlight semantically relevant regions, (2) a spatial-preserving orchestration schema to maintain object relationships, and (3) a budget-aware strategy to adaptively allocate tokens between global context and local details. Extensive experiments on nine benchmarks and three commercial MLLMs demonstrate that Zoomer boosts accuracy by up to 27% while cutting image token usage by up to 67%. Our approach establishes a principled methodology for robust, resource-aware multimodal understanding in settings where model internals are inaccessible.

Title: Multi-Antenna Users in Cell-Free Massive MIMO: Stream Allocation and Necessity of Downlink Pilots
Authors: Eren Berk Kama, Junbeom Kim, Emil Björnson
Abstract: We consider a cell-free massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) system with multiple antennas on the users and access points (APs). In previous works, the downlink spectral efficiency (SE) has been evaluated using the hardening bound that requires no downlink pilots. This approach works well for single-antenna users. In this paper, we show that much higher SEs can be achieved if downlink pilots are sent when having multi-antenna users. The reason is that the effective channel matrix does not harden. We propose a pilot-based downlink estimation scheme, derive a new SE expression, and show numerically that it yields substantially higher performance when having correlated Rayleigh fading channels. In cases with multi-antenna users, the APs can either transmit the same or different data streams. The latter reduces the fronthaul signaling but comes with a SE loss. We propose precoding and combining schemes for these cases and consider whether channel knowledge is shared between the APs. Finally, we show numerically how the number of users, APs, and the number of antennas on users and APs affect the SE.

Title: Automatic Stage Lighting Control: Is it a Rule-Driven Process or Generative Task?
Authors: Zijian Zhao, Dian Jin, Zijing Zhou, Xiaoyu Zhang
Abstract: Stage lighting is a vital component in live music performances, shaping an engaging experience for both musicians and audiences. In recent years, Automatic Stage Lighting Control (ASLC) has attracted growing interest due to the high costs of hiring or training professional lighting engineers. However, most existing ASLC solutions only classify music into limited categories and map them to predefined light patterns, resulting in formulaic and monotonous outcomes that lack rationality. To address this gap, this paper presents Skip-BART, an end-to-end model that directly learns from experienced lighting engineers and predict vivid, human-like stage lighting. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to conceptualize ASLC as a generative task rather than merely a classification problem. Our method adapts the BART model to take audio music as input and produce light hue and value (intensity) as output, incorporating a novel skip connection mechanism to enhance the relationship between music and light within the frame grid. To address the lack of available datasets, we create the first stage lighting dataset, along with several pre-training and transfer learning techniques to improve model training with limited data. We validate our method through both quantitative analysis and an human evaluation, demonstrating that Skip-BART outperforms conventional rule-based methods across all evaluation metrics and shows only a limited gap compared to real lighting engineers. To support further research, we have made our self-collected dataset, code, and trained model parameters available at this https URL .

Title: Some remarks on stochastic converse Lyapunov theorems
Authors: Pavel Osinenko, Grigory Yaremenko
Abstract: In this brief note, we investigate some constructions of Lyapunov functions for stochastic discrete-time stabilizable dynamical systems, in other words, controlled Markov chains. The main question here is whether a Lyapunov function in some statistical sense exists if the respective controlled Markov chain admits a stabilizing policy. We demonstrate some constructions extending on the classical results for deterministic systems. Some limitations of the constructed Lyapunov functions for stabilization are discussed, particularly for stabilization in mean. Although results for deterministic systems are well known, the stochastic case was addressed in less detail, which the current paper remarks on. A distinguishable feature of this work is the study of stabilizers that possess computationally tractable convergence certificates.

Title: Mamba2 Meets Silence: Robust Vocal Source Separation for Sparse Regions
Authors: Euiyeon Kim, Yong-Hoon Choi
Abstract: We introduce a new music source separation model tailored for accurate vocal isolation. Unlike Transformer-based approaches, which often fail to capture intermittently occurring vocals, our model leverages Mamba2, a recent state space model, to better capture long-range temporal dependencies. To handle long input sequences efficiently, we combine a band-splitting strategy with a dual-path architecture. Experiments show that our approach outperforms recent state-of-the-art models, achieving a cSDR of 11.03 dB-the best reported to date-and delivering substantial gains in uSDR. Moreover, the model exhibits stable and consistent performance across varying input lengths and vocal occurrence patterns. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of Mamba-based models for high-resolution audio processing and open up new directions for broader applications in audio research.

Title: STSR: High-Fidelity Speech Super-Resolution via Spectral-Transient Context Modeling
Authors: Jiajun Yuan, Xiaochen Wang, Yuhang Xiao, Yulin Wu, Chenhao Hu, Xueyang Lv
Abstract: Speech super-resolution (SR) reconstructs high-fidelity wideband speech from low-resolution inputs-a task that necessitates reconciling global harmonic coherence with local transient sharpness. While diffusion-based generative models yield impressive fidelity, their practical deployment is often stymied by prohibitive computational demands. Conversely, efficient time-domain architectures lack the explicit frequency representations essential for capturing long-range spectral dependencies and ensuring precise harmonic alignment. We introduce STSR, a unified end-to-end framework formulated in the MDCT domain to circumvent these limitations. STSR employs a Spectral-Contextual Attention mechanism that harnesses hierarchical windowing to adaptively aggregate non-local spectral context, enabling consistent harmonic reconstruction up to 48 kHz. Concurrently, a sparse-aware regularization strategy is employed to mitigate the suppression of transient components inherent in compressed spectral representations. STSR consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines in both perceptual fidelity and zero-shot generalization, providing a robust, real-time paradigm for high-quality speech restoration.

Title: Chunk Based Speech Pre-training with High Resolution Finite Scalar Quantization
Authors: Yun Tang, Cindy Tseng
Abstract: Low latency speech human-machine communication is becoming increasingly necessary as speech technology advances quickly in the last decade. One of the primary factors behind the advancement of speech technology is self-supervised learning. Most self-supervised learning algorithms are designed with full utterance assumption and compromises have to made if partial utterances are presented, which are common in the streaming applications. In this work, we propose a chunk based self-supervised learning (Chunk SSL) algorithm as an unified solution for both streaming and offline speech pre-training. Chunk SSL is optimized with the masked prediction loss and an acoustic encoder is encouraged to restore indices of those masked speech frames with help from unmasked frames in the same chunk and preceding chunks. A copy and append data augmentation approach is proposed to conduct efficient chunk based pre-training. Chunk SSL utilizes a finite scalar quantization (FSQ) module to discretize input speech features and our study shows a high resolution FSQ codebook, i.e., a codebook with vocabulary size up to a few millions, is beneficial to transfer knowledge from the pre-training task to the downstream tasks. A group masked prediction loss is employed during pre-training to alleviate the high memory and computation cost introduced by the large codebook. The proposed approach is examined in two speech to text tasks, i.e., speech recognition and speech translation. Experimental results on the \textsc{Librispeech} and \textsc{Must-C} datasets show that the proposed method could achieve very competitive results for speech to text tasks at both streaming and offline modes.

Title: Value of Multi-pursuer Single-evader Pursuit-evasion Game with Terminal Cost of Evader's Position: Relaxation of Convexity Condition
Authors: Weiwen Huang, Li Liang, Ningsheng Xu, Fang Deng
Abstract: In this study, we consider a multi-pursuer single-evader quantitative pursuit-evasion game with payoff function that includes only the terminal cost. The terminal cost is a function related only to the terminal position of the evader. This problem has been extensively studied in target defense games. Here, we prove that a candidate for the value function generated by geometric method is the viscosity solution of the corresponding Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs partial differential equation (HJI PDE) Dirichlet problem. Therefore, the value function of the game at each point can be computed by a mathematical program. In our work, the convexity of the terminal cost or the target is not required. The terminal cost only needs to be locally Lipschitz continuous. The cases in which the terminal costs or the targets are not convex are covered. Therefore, our result is more universal than those of previous studies, and the complexity of the proof is improved. We also discuss the optimal strategies in this game and present an intuitive explanation of this value function.

Title: Hear: Hierarchically Enhanced Aesthetic Representations For Multidimensional Music Evaluation
Authors: Shuyang Liu, Yuan Jin, Rui Lin, Shizhe Chen, Junyu Dai, Tao Jiang
Abstract: Evaluating song aesthetics is challenging due to the multidimensional nature of musical perception and the scarcity of labeled data. We propose HEAR, a robust music aesthetic evaluation framework that combines: (1) a multi-source multi-scale representations module to obtain complementary segment- and track-level features, (2) a hierarchical augmentation strategy to mitigate overfitting, and (3) a hybrid training objective that integrates regression and ranking losses for accurate scoring and reliable top-tier song identification. Experiments demonstrate that HEAR consistently outperforms the baseline across all metrics on both tracks of the ICASSP 2026 SongEval benchmark. The code and trained model weights are available at this https URL.

Title: Deep Reinforcement Learning Optimization for Uncertain Nonlinear Systems via Event-Triggered Robust Adaptive Dynamic Programming
Authors: Ningwei Bai, Chi Pui Chan, Qichen Yin, Tengyang Gong, Yunda Yan, Zezhi Tang
Abstract: This work proposes a unified control architecture that couples a Reinforcement Learning (RL)-driven controller with a disturbance-rejection Extended State Observer (ESO), complemented by an Event-Triggered Mechanism (ETM) to limit unnecessary computations. The ESO is utilized to estimate the system states and the lumped disturbance in real time, forming the foundation for effective disturbance compensation. To obtain near-optimal behavior without an accurate system description, a value-iteration-based Adaptive Dynamic Programming (ADP) method is adopted for policy approximation. The inclusion of the ETM ensures that parameter updates of the learning module are executed only when the state deviation surpasses a predefined bound, thereby preventing excessive learning activity and substantially reducing computational load. A Lyapunov-oriented analysis is used to characterize the stability properties of the resulting closed-loop system. Numerical experiments further confirm that the developed approach maintains strong control performance and disturbance tolerance, while achieving a significant reduction in sampling and processing effort compared with standard time-triggered ADP schemes.

Title: Fun-Audio-Chat Technical Report
Authors: Tongyi Fun Team, Qian Chen, Luyao Cheng, Chong Deng, Xiangang Li, Jiaqing Liu, Chao-Hong Tan, Wen Wang, Junhao Xu, Jieping Ye, Qinglin Zhang, Qiquan Zhang, Jingren Zhou
Abstract: Recent advancements in joint speech-text models show great potential for seamless voice interactions. However, existing models face critical challenges: temporal resolution mismatch between speech tokens (25Hz) and text tokens (~3Hz) dilutes semantic information, incurs high computational costs, and causes catastrophic forgetting of text LLM knowledge. We introduce Fun-Audio-Chat, a Large Audio Language Model addressing these limitations via two innovations from our previous work DrVoice. First, Dual-Resolution Speech Representations (DRSR): the Shared LLM processes audio at efficient 5Hz (via token grouping), while the Speech Refined Head generates high-quality tokens at 25Hz, balancing efficiency (~50% GPU reduction) and quality. Second, Core-Cocktail Training, a two-stage fine-tuning with intermediate merging that mitigates catastrophic forgetting. We then apply Multi-Task DPO Training to enhance robustness, audio understanding, instruction-following and voice empathy. This multi-stage post-training enables Fun-Audio-Chat to retain text LLM knowledge while gaining powerful audio understanding, reasoning, and generation. Unlike recent LALMs requiring large-scale audio-text pre-training, Fun-Audio-Chat leverages pre-trained models and extensive post-training. Fun-Audio-Chat 8B and MoE 30B-A3B achieve competitive performance on Speech-to-Text and Speech-to-Speech tasks, ranking top among similar-scale models on Spoken QA benchmarks. They also achieve competitive to superior performance on Audio Understanding, Speech Function Calling, Instruction-Following and Voice Empathy. We develop Fun-Audio-Chat-Duplex, a full-duplex variant with strong performance on Spoken QA and full-duplex interactions. We open-source Fun-Audio-Chat-8B with training and inference code, and provide an interactive demo, at this https URL .

Title: Contingency Model-based Control (CMC) for Communicationless Cooperative Collision Avoidance in Robot Swarms
Authors: Georg Schildbach
Abstract: Cooperative collision avoidance between robots, or `agents,' in swarm operations remains an open challenge. Assuming a decentralized architecture, each agent is responsible for making its own decisions and choosing its control actions. Most existing approaches rely on a (wireless) communication network between (some of) the agents. In reality, however, communication is brittle. It may be affected by latency, further delays and packet losses, and transmission faults. Moreover, it is subject to adversarial attacks, such as jamming or spoofing. This paper proposes Contingency Model-based Control (CMC), a decentralized cooperative approach that does not rely on communication. Instead, the control algorithm is based on consensual rules that are designed for all agents offline, similar to traffic rules. For CMC, this includes the definition of a contingency trajectory for each robot, and perpendicular bisecting planes as collision avoidance constraints. The setup permits a full guarantee of recursive feasibility and collision avoidance between all swarm members in closed-loop operation. CMC naturally satisfies the plug & play paradigm, i.e., new robots may enter the swarm dynamically. The effectiveness of the CMC regime is demonstrated in two numerical examples, showing that the collision avoidance guarantee is intact and the robot swarm operates smoothly in a constrained environment.

Title: Leveraging High-Fidelity Digital Models and Reinforcement Learning for Mission Engineering: A Case Study of Aerial Firefighting Under Perfect Information
Authors: İbrahim Oğuz Çetinkaya, Sajad Khodadadian, Taylan G. Topcu
Abstract: As systems engineering (SE) objectives evolve from design and operation of monolithic systems to complex System of Systems (SoS), the discipline of Mission Engineering (ME) has emerged which is increasingly being accepted as a new line of thinking for the SE community. Moreover, mission environments are uncertain, dynamic, and mission outcomes are a direct function of how the mission assets will interact with this environment. This proves static architectures brittle and calls for analytically rigorous approaches for ME. To that end, this paper proposes an intelligent mission coordination methodology that integrates digital mission models with Reinforcement Learning (RL), that specifically addresses the need for adaptive task allocation and reconfiguration. More specifically, we are leveraging a Digital Engineering (DE) based infrastructure that is composed of a high-fidelity digital mission model and agent-based simulation; and then we formulate the mission tactics management problem as a Markov Decision Process (MDP), and employ an RL agent trained via Proximal Policy Optimization. By leveraging the simulation as a sandbox, we map the system states to actions, refining the policy based on realized mission outcomes. The utility of the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator is demonstrated through an aerial firefighting case study. Our findings indicate that the RL-based intelligent mission coordinator not only surpasses baseline performance but also significantly reduces the variability in mission performance. Thus, this study serves as a proof of concept demonstrating that DE-enabled mission simulations combined with advanced analytical tools offer a mission-agnostic framework for improving ME practice; which can be extended to more complicated fleet design and selection problems in the future from a mission-first perspective.
