Title: Fuzzy Model Identification and Self Learning with Smooth Compositions
Authors: Ebrahim Navid Sadjadi, Jesus Garcia, Jose M. Molina, Akbar Hashemi Borzabadi, Monireh Asadi Abchouyeh
Abstract: This paper develops a smooth model identification and self-learning strategy for dynamic systems taking into account possible parameter variations and uncertainties. We have tried to solve the problem such that the model follows the changes and variations in the system on a continuous and smooth surface. Running the model to adaptively gain the optimum values of the parameters on a smooth surface would facilitate further improvements in the application of other derivative based optimization control algorithms such as MPC or robust control algorithms to achieve a combined modeling-control scheme. Compared to the earlier works on the smooth fuzzy modeling structures, we could reach a desired trade-off between the model optimality and the computational load. The proposed method has been evaluated on a test problem as well as the non-linear dynamic of a chemical process.

Title: Multi-Center Study on Deep Learning-Assisted Detection and Classification of Fetal Central Nervous System Anomalies Using Ultrasound Imaging
Authors: Yang Qi, Jiaxin Cai, Jing Lu, Runqing Xiong, Rongshang Chen, Liping Zheng, Duo Ma
Abstract: Prenatal ultrasound evaluates fetal growth and detects congenital abnormalities during pregnancy, but the examination of ultrasound images by radiologists requires expertise and sophisticated equipment, which would otherwise fail to improve the rate of identifying specific types of fetal central nervous system (CNS) abnormalities and result in unnecessary patient examinations. We construct a deep learning model to improve the overall accuracy of the diagnosis of fetal cranial anomalies to aid prenatal diagnosis. In our collected multi-center dataset of fetal craniocerebral anomalies covering four typical anomalies of the fetal central nervous system (CNS): anencephaly, encephalocele (including meningocele), holoprosencephaly, and rachischisis, patient-level prediction accuracy reaches 94.5%, with an AUROC value of 99.3%. In the subgroup analyzes, our model is applicable to the entire gestational period, with good identification of fetal anomaly types for any gestational period. Heatmaps superimposed on the ultrasound images not only provide a visual interpretation for the algorithm but also provide an intuitive visual aid to the physician by highlighting key areas that need to be reviewed, helping the physician to quickly identify and validate key areas. Finally, the retrospective reader study demonstrates that by combining the automatic prediction of the DL system with the professional judgment of the radiologist, the diagnostic accuracy and efficiency can be effectively improved and the misdiagnosis rate can be reduced, which has an important clinical application prospect.

Title: Integrated Strategy for Urban Traffic Optimization: Prediction, Adaptive Signal Control, and Distributed Communication via Messaging
Authors: Ismail Zrigui, Samira Khoulji, Mohamed Larbi Kerkeb
Abstract: This work introduces an integrated approach to optimizing urban traffic by combining predictive modeling of vehicle flow, adaptive traffic signal control, and a modular integration architecture through distributed messaging. Using real-time data from various sensors, the system anticipates traffic fluctuations and dynamically adjusts signal phase durations to minimize delays and improve traffic flow. This proactive adjustment, supported by algorithms inspired by simulated annealing and reinforcement learning, also enhances energy efficiency, reduces pollutant emissions, and responds effectively to unexpected events (adverse weather, accidents, or temporary gatherings). Preliminary simulations conducted in a realistic urban environment demonstrate a significant reduction in average waiting times. Future developments include incorporating data from connected vehicles, integrating new modes of transport, and continuously refining predictive models to address the growing challenges of urban mobility.

Title: SMTL: A Stratified Logic for Expressive Multi-Level Temporal Specifications
Authors: Ali Baheri, Peng Wei
Abstract: We present \textbf{\underline{S}}tratified \textbf{\underline{M}}etric \textbf{\underline{T}}emporal \textbf{\underline{L}}ogic (SMTL), a novel formalism for specifying and verifying properties of complex cyber-physical systems that exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal and abstraction scales. SMTL extends existing temporal logics by incorporating a stratification operator, enabling the association of temporal properties with specific abstraction levels. This allows for the natural expression of multi-scale requirements while maintaining formal reasoning about inter-level relationships. We formalize the syntax and semantics of SMTL, proving that it strictly subsumes metric temporal logic (MTL) and offers enhanced expressiveness by capturing properties unattainable in existing logics. Numerical simulations comparing agents operating under MTL and SMTL specifications show that SMTL enhances agent coordination and safety, reducing collision rates without substantial computational overhead or compromising path efficiency. These findings underscore SMTL's potential as a valuable tool for designing and verifying complex multi-agent systems operating across diverse temporal and abstraction scales.

Title: Timely Remote Estimation with Memory at the Receiver
Authors: Sirin Chakraborty, Yin Sun
Abstract: In this study, we consider a remote estimation system that estimates a time-varying target based on sensor data transmitted over wireless channel. Due to transmission errors, some data packets fail to reach the receiver. To mitigate this, the receiver uses a buffer to store recently received data packets, which allows for more accurate estimation from the incomplete received data. Our research focuses on optimizing the transmission scheduling policy to minimize the estimation error, which is quantified as a function of the age of information vector associated with the buffered packets. Our results show that maintaining a buffer at the receiver results in better estimation performance for non-Markovian sources.

Title: Tree-NET: Enhancing Medical Image Segmentation Through Efficient Low-Level Feature Training
Authors: Orhan Demirci, Bulent Yilmaz
Abstract: This paper introduces Tree-NET, a novel framework for medical image segmentation that leverages bottleneck feature supervision to enhance both segmentation accuracy and computational efficiency. While previous studies have employed bottleneck feature supervision, their applications have largely been limited to the training phase, offering no computational benefits during training or evaluation. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first to propose a framework that incorporates two additional training phases for segmentation models, utilizing bottleneck features at both input and output stages. This approach significantly improves computational performance by reducing input and output dimensions with a negligible addition to parameter count, without compromising accuracy. Tree-NET features a three-layer architecture comprising Encoder-Net and Decoder-Net, which are autoencoders designed to compress input and label data, respectively, and Bridge-Net, a segmentation framework that supervises the bottleneck features. By focusing on dense, compressed representations, Tree-NET enhances operational efficiency and can be seamlessly integrated into existing segmentation models without altering their internal structures or increasing model size. We evaluate Tree-NET on two critical segmentation tasks -- skin lesion and polyp segmentation -- using various backbone models, including U-NET variants and Polyp-PVT. Experimental results demonstrate that Tree-NET reduces FLOPs by a factor of 4 to 13 and decreases memory usage, while achieving comparable or superior accuracy compared to the original architectures. These findings underscore Tree-NET's potential as a robust and efficient solution for medical image segmentation.

Title: RainGaugeNet: CSI-Based Sub-6 GHz Rainfall Attenuation Measurement and Classification for ISAC Applications
Authors: Yan Li, Jie Yang, Yixuan Huang, Tao Yang, Chao-Kai Wen, Shi Jin
Abstract: Rainfall impacts daily activities and can lead to severe hazards such as flooding. Traditional rainfall measurement systems often lack granularity or require extensive infrastructure. While the attenuation of electromagnetic waves due to rainfall is well-documented for frequencies above 10 GHz, sub-6 GHz bands are typically assumed to experience negligible effects. However, recent studies suggest measurable attenuation even at these lower frequencies. This study presents the first channel state information (CSI)-based measurement and analysis of rainfall attenuation at 2.8 GHz. The results confirm the presence of rain-induced attenuation at this frequency, although classification remains challenging. The attenuation follows a power-law decay model, with the rate of attenuation decreasing as rainfall intensity increases. Additionally, rainfall onset significantly increases the delay spread. Building on these insights, we propose RainGaugeNet, the first CSI-based rainfall classification model that leverages multipath and temporal features. Using only 20 seconds of CSI data, RainGaugeNet achieved over 90% classification accuracy in line-of-sight scenarios and over 85% in non-lineof-sight scenarios, significantly outperforming state-of-the-art methods.

Title: tCURLoRA: Tensor CUR Decomposition Based Low-Rank Parameter Adaptation for Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Guanghua He, Wangang Cheng, Hancan Zhu, Xiaohao Cai, Gaohang Yu
Abstract: Transfer learning, by leveraging knowledge from pre-trained models, has significantly enhanced the performance of target tasks. However, as deep neural networks scale up, full fine-tuning introduces substantial computational and storage challenges in resource-constrained environments, limiting its widespread adoption. To address this, parameter-efficient fine-tuning (PEFT) methods have been developed to reduce computational complexity and storage requirements by minimizing the number of updated parameters. While matrix decomposition-based PEFT methods, such as LoRA, show promise, they struggle to fully capture the high-dimensional structural characteristics of model weights. In contrast, high-dimensional tensors offer a more natural representation of neural network weights, allowing for a more comprehensive capture of higher-order features and multi-dimensional interactions. In this paper, we propose tCURLoRA, a novel fine-tuning method based on tensor CUR decomposition. By concatenating pre-trained weight matrices into a three-dimensional tensor and applying tensor CUR decomposition, we update only the lower-order tensor components during fine-tuning, effectively reducing computational and storage overhead. Experimental results demonstrate that tCURLoRA outperforms existing PEFT methods in medical image segmentation tasks.

Title: Scattering Environment Aware Joint Multi-user Channel Estimation and Localization with Spatially Reused Pilots
Authors: Kaiyuan Tian, Yani Chi, Yufan Zhou, An Liu
Abstract: The increasing number of users leads to an increase in pilot overhead, and the limited pilot resources make it challenging to support all users using orthogonal pilots. By fully capturing the inherent physical characteristics of the multi-user (MU) environment, it is possible to reduce pilot costs and improve the channel estimation performance. In reality, users nearby may share the same scatterer, while users further apart tend to have orthogonal channels. This paper proposes a two-timescale approach for joint MU uplink channel estimation and localization in MIMO-OFDM systems, which fully captures the spatial characteristics of MUs. To accurately represent the structure of the MU channel, the channel is modeled in the 3-D location domain. In the long-timescale phase, the time-space-time multiple signal classification (TST-MUSIC) algorithm initially offers a rough approximation of scatterer positions for each user, which is subsequently refined through the scatterer association algorithm based on density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm. The BS then utilizes this prior information to apply a graph-coloring-based user grouping algorithm, enabling spatial division multiplexing of pilots and reducing pilot overhead. In the short timescale phase, a low-complexity scattering environment aware location-domain turbo channel estimation (SEA-LD-TurboCE) algorithm is introduced to merge the overlapping scatterer information from MUs, facilitating high-precision joint MU channel estimation and localization under spatially reused pilots. Simulation results verify the superior channel estimation and localization performance of our proposed scheme over the baselines.

Title: Digital Deep Joint Source-Channel Coding with Blind Training for Adaptive Modulation and Power Control
Authors: Yongjeong Oh, Joohyuk Park, Jinho Choi, Jihong Park, Yo-Seb Jeon
Abstract: This paper proposes a novel digital deep joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) framework that achieves robust performance across diverse communication environments without requiring extensive retraining and prior knowledge of communication environments. Traditional digital DeepJSCC techniques often face challenges in adapting to various communication environments, as they require significant training overhead and large amounts of communication data to develop either multiple specialized models or a single generalized model, in pre-defined communication environments. To address this challenge, in our framework, an error-adaptive blind training strategy is devised, which eliminates the need for prior knowledge of communication environments. This is achieved by modeling the relationship between the encoder's output and the decoder's input using binary symmetric channels, and optimizing bit-flip probabilities by treating them as trainable parameters. In our framework, a training-aware communication strategy is also presented, which dynamically selects the optimal encoder-decoder pair and transmission parameters based on current channel conditions. In particular, in this strategy, an adaptive power and modulation control method is developed to minimize the total transmission power, while maintaining high task performance. Simulation results demonstrate that our framework outperforms existing DeepJSCC methods, achieving higher peak signal-to-noise ratio, lower power consumption, and requiring significantly fewer encoder-decoder pairs for adaptation.

Title: Stochastic Generalized Dynamic Games with Coupled Chance Constraints
Authors: Seyed Shahram Yadollahi, Hamed Kebriaei, Sadegh Soudjani
Abstract: Designing multi-agent systems with safety constraints and uncertain dynamics is a challenging problem. This paper studies a stochastic dynamic non-cooperative game with coupling safety chance constraints. The uncertainty is assumed to satisfy a concentration of measure property. Firstly, due to the non-convexity of chance constraints, a convex under-approximation of chance constraints is given using constraints on the expectation. Then, the conditions for the existence of the stochastic generalized Nash equilibrium (SGNE) of the under-approximated game are investigated, and the relation between the $\varepsilon-$SGNE of the original game and the under-approximated one is derived. A sampling-based algorithm is proposed for the SGNE seeking of the under-approximated game that does not require knowing the distribution of the uncertainty nor the analytical computation of expectations. Finally, under some assumptions on the game's pseudo-gradient mapping, the almost sure convergence of the algorithm to SGNE is proven. A numerical study is carried out on demand-side management in microgrids with shared battery to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed scheme.

Title: On Symmetries in Analytic Input-Output Systems
Authors: W. Steven Gray, Erik I. Verriest
Abstract: There are many notions of symmetry for state space models. They play a role in understanding when systems are time reversible, provide a system theoretic interpretation of thermodynamics, and have applications in certain stabilization and optimal control problems. The earliest form of symmetry for analytic input-output systems is due to Fliess who introduced systems described by an exchangeable generating series. In this case, one is able to write the output as a memoryless analytic function of the integral of each input. The first goal of this paper is to describe two new types of symmetry for such Chen--Fliess input-output systems, namely, coefficient reversible symmetry and palindromic symmetry. Each concept is then related to the notion of an exchangeable series. The second goal of the paper is to provide an in-depth analysis of Chen--Fliess input-output systems whose generating series are linear time-varying, palindromic, and have generating series coefficients growing at a maximal rate while ensuring some type of convergence. It is shown that such series have an infinite Hankel rank and Lie rank, have a certain infinite dimensional state space realization, and a description of their relative degree and zero dynamics is given.

Title: Deep Learning-Driven Segmentation of Ischemic Stroke Lesions Using Multi-Channel MRI
Authors: Ashiqur Rahman, Muhammad E. H. Chowdhury, Md Sharjis Ibne Wadud, Rusab Sarmun, Adam Mushtak, Sohaib Bassam Zoghoul, Israa Al-Hashimi
Abstract: Ischemic stroke, caused by cerebral vessel occlusion, presents substantial challenges in medical imaging due to the variability and subtlety of stroke lesions. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) plays a crucial role in diagnosing and managing ischemic stroke, yet existing segmentation techniques often fail to accurately delineate lesions. This study introduces a novel deep learning-based method for segmenting ischemic stroke lesions using multi-channel MRI modalities, including Diffusion Weighted Imaging (DWI), Apparent Diffusion Coefficient (ADC), and enhanced Diffusion Weighted Imaging (eDWI). The proposed architecture integrates DenseNet121 as the encoder with Self-Organized Operational Neural Networks (SelfONN) in the decoder, enhanced by Channel and Space Compound Attention (CSCA) and Double Squeeze-and-Excitation (DSE) blocks. Additionally, a custom loss function combining Dice Loss and Jaccard Loss with weighted averages is introduced to improve model performance. Trained and evaluated on the ISLES 2022 dataset, the model achieved Dice Similarity Coefficients (DSC) of 83.88% using DWI alone, 85.86% with DWI and ADC, and 87.49% with the integration of DWI, ADC, and eDWI. This approach not only outperforms existing methods but also addresses key limitations in current segmentation practices. These advancements significantly enhance diagnostic precision and treatment planning for ischemic stroke, providing valuable support for clinical decision-making.

Title: Optimizing Audio Compression Through Entropy-Controlled Dithering
Authors: Ellison Murray, Morriel Kasher, Predrag Spasojevic
Abstract: This paper explores entropy-controlled dithering techniques in audio compression, examining the application of standard and modified TPDFs, combined with noise shaping and entropy-controlled parameters, across various audio contexts, including pitch, loudness, rhythm, and instrumentation variations. Perceptual quality metrics such as VISQOL and STOI were used to evaluate performance. The results demonstrate that TPDF-based dithering consistently outperforms RPDF, particularly under optimal alpha conditions, while highlighting performance variability based on signal characteristics. These findings suggest the situational appropriateness of using various TPDF distributions. This work emphasizes the trade-off between entropy and perceptual fidelity, offering insights into the potential of entropy-controlled dithering as a foundation for enhanced audio compression algorithms. A practical implementation as a Digital Audio Workstation plugin introduces customizable dithering controls, laying the groundwork for future advancements in audio compression algorithms.

Title: Diabetic Retinopathy Detection Using CNN with Residual Block with DCGAN
Authors: Debjany Ghosh Aronno, Sumaiya Saeha
Abstract: Diabetic Retinopathy (DR) is a major cause of blindness worldwide, caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina due to diabetes. Early detection and classification of DR are crucial for timely intervention and preventing vision loss. This work proposes an automated system for DR detection using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) with a residual block architecture, which enhances feature extraction and model performance. To further improve the model's robustness, we incorporate advanced data augmentation techniques, specifically leveraging a Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network (DCGAN) for generating diverse retinal images. This approach increases the variability of training data, making the model more generalizable and capable of handling real-world variations in retinal images. The system is designed to classify retinal images into five distinct categories, from No DR to Proliferative DR, providing an efficient and scalable solution for early diagnosis and monitoring of DR progression. The proposed model aims to support healthcare professionals in large-scale DR screening, especially in resource-constrained settings.

Title: Multi-Satellite Beam Hopping and Power Allocation Using Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Xia Xie, Kexin Fan, Wenfeng Deng, Nikolaos Pappas, Qinyu Zhang
Abstract: In non-geostationary orbit (NGSO) satellite communication systems, effectively utilizing beam hopping (BH) technology is crucial for addressing uneven traffic demands. However, optimizing beam scheduling and resource allocation in multi-NGSO BH scenarios remains a significant challenge. This paper proposes a multi-NGSO BH algorithm based on deep reinforcement learning (DRL) to optimize beam illumination patterns and power allocation. By leveraging three degrees of freedom (i.e., time, space, and power), the algorithm aims to optimize the long-term throughput and the long-term cumulative average delay (LTCAD). The solution is based on proximal policy optimization (PPO) with a hybrid action space combining discrete and continuous actions. Using two policy networks with a shared base layer, the proposed algorithm jointly optimizes beam scheduling and power allocation. One network selects beam illumination patterns in the discrete action space, while the other manages power allocation in the continuous space. Simulation results show that the proposed algorithm significantly reduces LTCAD while maintaining high throughput in time-varying traffic scenarios. Compared to the four benchmark methods, it improves network throughput by up to $8.9\%$ and reduces LTCAD by up to $69.2\%$

Title: Framework for lung CT image segmentation based on UNet++
Authors: Hao Ziang, Jingsi Zhang, Lixian Li
Abstract: Recently, the state-of-art models for medical image segmentation is U-Net and their variants. These networks, though succeeding in deriving notable results, ignore the practical problem hanging over the medical segmentation field: overfitting and small dataset. The over-complicated deep neural networks unnecessarily extract meaningless information, and a majority of them are not suitable for lung slice CT image segmentation task. To overcome the two limitations, we proposed a new whole-process network merging advanced UNet++ model. The network comprises three main modules: data augmentation, optimized neural network, parameter fine-tuning. By incorporating diverse methods, the training results demonstrate a significant advantage over similar works, achieving leading accuracy of 98.03% with the lowest overfitting. potential. Our network is remarkable as one of the first to target on lung slice CT images.

Title: Aerial Active STAR-RIS-Aided IoT NOMA Networks
Authors: Jingjing Zhao, Qian Xu, Xidong Mu, Yuanwei Liu, Yanbo Zhu
Abstract: A novel framework of the unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)-mounted active simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) communications with the non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) is proposed for Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks. In particular, an active STAR-RIS is deployed onboard to enhance the communication link between the base station (BS) and the IoT devices, and NOMA is utilized for supporting the multi-device connectivity. Based on the proposed framework, a system sum rate maximization problem is formulated for the joint optimization of the active STAR-RIS beamforming, the UAV trajectory design, and the power allocation. To solve the non-convex problem with highly-coupled variables, an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm is proposed to decouple the original problem into three subproblems. Specifically, for the active STAR-RIS beamforming, the amplification coefficient, the power-splitting ratio, and the phase shift are incorporated into a combined variable to simplify the optimization process. Afterwards, the penalty-based method is invoked for handling the non-convex rank-one constraint. For the UAV trajectory design and the power allocation subproblems, the successive convex optimization method is applied for iteratively approximating the local-optimal solution. Numerical results demonstrate that: 1) the proposed algorithm achieves superior performance compared to the benchmarks in terms of the sum rate; and 2) the UAV-mounted active STAR-RIS can effectively enhance the channel gain from the BS to the IoT devices by the high-quality channel construction and the power compensation.

Title: Efficient Long Speech Sequence Modelling for Time-Domain Depression Level Estimation
Authors: Shuanglin Li, Zhijie Xie, Syed Mohsen Naqvi
Abstract: Depression significantly affects emotions, thoughts, and daily activities. Recent research indicates that speech signals contain vital cues about depression, sparking interest in audio-based deep-learning methods for estimating its severity. However, most methods rely on time-frequency representations of speech which have recently been criticized for their limitations due to the loss of information when performing time-frequency projections, e.g. Fourier transform, and Mel-scale transformation. Furthermore, segmenting real-world speech into brief intervals risks losing critical interconnections between recordings. Additionally, such an approach may not adequately reflect real-world scenarios, as individuals with depression often pause and slow down in their conversations and interactions. Building on these observations, we present an efficient method for depression level estimation using long speech signals in the time domain. The proposed method leverages a state space model coupled with the dual-path structure-based long sequence modelling module and temporal external attention module to reconstruct and enhance the detection of depression-related cues hidden in the raw audio waveforms. Experimental results on the AVEC2013 and AVEC2014 datasets show promising results in capturing consequential long-sequence depression cues and demonstrate outstanding performance over the state-of-the-art.

Title: A Frequency-aware Augmentation Network for Mental Disorders Assessment from Audio
Authors: Shuanglin Li, Siyang Song, Rajesh Nair, Syed Mohsen Naqvi
Abstract: Depression and Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) stand out as the common mental health challenges today. In affective computing, speech signals serve as effective biomarkers for mental disorder assessment. Current research, relying on labor-intensive hand-crafted features or simplistic time-frequency representations, often overlooks critical details by not accounting for the differential impacts of various frequency bands and temporal fluctuations. Therefore, we propose a frequency-aware augmentation network with dynamic convolution for depression and ADHD assessment. In the proposed method, the spectrogram is used as the input feature and adopts a multi-scale convolution to help the network focus on discriminative frequency bands related to mental disorders. A dynamic convolution is also designed to aggregate multiple convolution kernels dynamically based upon their attentions which are input-independent to capture dynamic information. Finally, a feature augmentation block is proposed to enhance the feature representation ability and make full use of the captured information. Experimental results on AVEC 2014 and self-recorded ADHD dataset prove the robustness of our method, an RMSE of 9.23 was attained for estimating depression severity, along with an accuracy of 89.8\% in detecting ADHD.

Title: Remote Inference over Dynamic Links via Adaptive Rate Deep Task-Oriented Vector Quantization
Authors: Eyal Fishel, May Malka, Shai Ginzach, Nir Shlezinger
Abstract: A broad range of technologies rely on remote inference, wherein data acquired is conveyed over a communication channel for inference in a remote server. Communication between the participating entities is often carried out over rate-limited channels, necessitating data compression for reducing latency. While deep learning facilitates joint design of the compression mapping along with encoding and inference rules, existing learned compression mechanisms are static, and struggle in adapting their resolution to changes in channel conditions and to dynamic links. To address this, we propose Adaptive Rate Task-Oriented Vector Quantization (ARTOVeQ), a learned compression mechanism that is tailored for remote inference over dynamic links. ARTOVeQ is based on designing nested codebooks along with a learning algorithm employing progressive learning. We show that ARTOVeQ extends to support low-latency inference that is gradually refined via successive refinement principles, and that it enables the simultaneous usage of multiple resolutions when conveying high-dimensional data. Numerical results demonstrate that the proposed scheme yields remote deep inference that operates with multiple rates, supports a broad range of bit budgets, and facilitates rapid inference that gradually improves with more bits exchanged, while approaching the performance of single-rate deep quantization methods.

Title: Low RCS High-Gain Broadband Substrate Integrated Waveguide Antenna Based on Elliptical Polarization Conversion Metasurface
Authors: Cuiqin Zhao, Dongya Shen, Yanming Duan, Yuting Wang, Huihui Xiao, Longxiang Luo
Abstract: Designed an elliptical polarization conversion metasurface (PCM) for Ka-band applications, alongside a high-gain substrate integrated waveguide (SIW) antenna. The PCM elements are integrated into the antenna design in a chessboard array configuration, with the goal of achieving effective reduction in the antenna's radar cross section (RCS). Both the PCM elements and antenna structure exhibit a simple design. The top layer of the metasurface (MS) elements employs an elliptical pattern symmetric along the diagonal, enabling efficient conversion of linearly polarized waves. The antenna component, on the other hand, consists of a broadband dipole antenna fed by SIW slot coupling. Verified through simulations, the polarization conversion bandwidth of this PCM unit reaches 80.38% where polarization conversion ratio (PCR) exceeds 90% (25.3-59.3GHz), demonstrating exceptional conversion performance. When the dipole antenna is combined with the PCM, its -10dB impedance bandwidth reaches to 15.09% (33.7-39.2GHz), with a maximum realized gain of 9.1dBi. Notably, the antenna loaded with the chessboard PCM structure effectively disperses the energy of scattered echoes around, significantly reducing the concentration of scattered energy in the direction of the incident wave, thereby achieving an effective reduction in RCS.

Title: Scaling Achievable Rates in SIM-aided MIMO Systems with Metasurface Layers: A Hybrid Optimization Framework
Authors: Eduard E. Bahingayi, Nemanja Stefan Perović, Le-Nam Tran
Abstract: We investigate the achievable rate (AR) of a stacked intelligent metasurface (SIM)-aided holographic multiple-input multiple-output (HMIMO) system by jointly optimizing the SIM phase shifts and power allocation. Contrary to earlier studies suggesting that the AR decreases when the number of metasurface layers increases past a certain point for \emph{a fixed SIM thickness}, our findings demonstrate consistent increase. To achieve this, we introduce two problem formulations: one based on directly maximizing the AR (RMax) and the other focused on minimizing inter-stream interference (IMin). To solve the RMax problem, we apply Riemannian manifold optimization (RMO) and weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) methods to optimize the SIM phase shifts and power allocation alternately. For the IMin problem, we derive an efficient algorithm that iteratively updates each meta-atom's phase shift using a closed-form expression while keeping others fixed. Our key contribution is integrating these two approaches, where the IMin solution initializes the SIM phase shifts in the first algorithm. This hybrid strategy enhances AR performance across varying numbers of metasurface layers. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithms outperform existing benchmarks. Most importantly, we show that increasing the number of metasurface layers while keeping the SIM thickness fixed leads to significant AR improvements.

Title: KM-UNet KAN Mamba UNet for medical image segmentation
Authors: Yibo Zhang
Abstract: Medical image segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging analysis. Traditional CNN-based methods struggle with modeling long-range dependencies, while Transformer-based models, despite their success, suffer from quadratic computational complexity. To address these limitations, we propose KM-UNet, a novel U-shaped network architecture that combines the strengths of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) and state-space models (SSMs). KM-UNet leverages the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem for efficient feature representation and SSMs for scalable long-range modeling, achieving a balance between accuracy and computational efficiency. We evaluate KM-UNet on five benchmark datasets: ISIC17, ISIC18, CVC, BUSI, and GLAS. Experimental results demonstrate that KM-UNet achieves competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art methods in medical image segmentation tasks. To the best of our knowledge, KM-UNet is the first medical image segmentation framework integrating KANs and SSMs. This work provides a valuable baseline and new insights for the development of more efficient and interpretable medical image segmentation systems.

Title: A Novel Comprehensive Multiport Network Model for Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM) Characterization and OptimizationA
Authors: Andrea Abrardo, Giulio Bartoli, Alberto Toccafondi
Abstract: Reconfigurable Intelligent Surfaces (RIS) are transformative technologies for next-generation wireless communication, offering advanced control over electromagnetic wave propagation. While RIS have been extensively studied, Stacked Intelligent Metasurfaces (SIM), which extend the RIS concept to multi-layered systems, present significant modeling and optimization challenges. This work addresses these challenges by introducing a new optimization framework for heterogeneous SIM architectures that, compared to previous approaches, is based on a comprehensive model without relying on specific assumptions, allowing for a broader applicability of the results. To this end, we first present a model based on multi-port network theory for characterizing a general electromagnetic collaborative object (ECO) and derive a general framework for ECO optimization. We then introduce the SIM as an ECO with a specific architecture and provide insights into SIM optimization for various architectures, discussing the complexity in each case. Next, we analyze the impact of commonly used assumptions, and as a further contribution, we propose a backpropagation algorithm for implementing the gradient descent method for a simplified SIM configuration.

Title: Back to Base: Towards Hands-Off Learning via Safe Resets with Reach-Avoid Safety Filters
Authors: Azra Begzadić, Nikhil Uday Shinde, Sander Tonkens, Dylan Hirsch, Kaleb Ugalde, Michael C. Yip, Jorge Cortés, Sylvia Herbert
Abstract: Designing controllers that accomplish tasks while guaranteeing safety constraints remains a significant challenge. We often want an agent to perform well in a nominal task, such as environment exploration, while ensuring it can avoid unsafe states and return to a desired target by a specific time. In particular we are motivated by the setting of safe, efficient, hands-off training for reinforcement learning in the real world. By enabling a robot to safely and autonomously reset to a desired region (e.g., charging stations) without human intervention, we can enhance efficiency and facilitate training. Safety filters, such as those based on control barrier functions, decouple safety from nominal control objectives and rigorously guarantee safety. Despite their success, constructing these functions for general nonlinear systems with control constraints and system uncertainties remains an open problem. This paper introduces a safety filter obtained from the value function associated with the reach-avoid problem. The proposed safety filter minimally modifies the nominal controller while avoiding unsafe regions and guiding the system back to the desired target set. By preserving policy performance while allowing safe resetting, we enable efficient hands-off reinforcement learning and advance the feasibility of safe training for real world robots. We demonstrate our approach using a modified version of soft actor-critic to safely train a swing-up task on a modified cartpole stabilization problem.

Title: Modeling measurements for quantitative imaging subsurface targets
Authors: Arnold Kim, Chrysoula Tsogka
Abstract: We study ground-penetrating synthetic aperture radar measurements of scattering by targets located below a rough air-soil interface. By considering the inherent space/angle limitations of this imaging modality, we introduce a simplified model for measurements. This model assumes (i) first-order interactions between the target and the air-soil interface, (ii) scattering by the target below a flat air-soil interface, and (iii) a point target model. Using the method of fundamental solutions to simulate two-dimensional simulations of scalar waves for the direct scattering problem, we systematically study each of these data modeling assumptions. To test and validate these assumptions, we apply principal component analysis to approximately remove ground bounce signals from measurements and then apply Kirchhoff migration on that processed data to produce images. We show that images using this modeled data are nearly identical to those that use simulated measurements from the full direct scattering problem. In that way, we show that this model contains the essential information contained in measurements. Consequently, it provides a theoretical framework for understanding how inherent space/angle limitations affect subsurface imaging systems.

Title: Multi-Transmission Node DER Aggregation: Chance-Constrained Unit Commitment with Bounded Hetero-Dimensional Mixture Model for Uncertain Distribution Factors
Authors: Weilun Wang, Zhentong Shao, Yikui Liu, Brent Eldridge, Abhishek Somani, Jesse T. Holzer, Lei Wu
Abstract: To facilitate the integration of distributed energy resources (DERs) into the wholesale market while maintaining the tractability of associated market operation tools such as unit commitment (UC), existing DER aggregation (DERA) studies usually consider that each DERA is presented on a single node of the transmission network. Nevertheless, the increasing scale and geographical distribution of DERs spur the emergence of DERAs covering multiple transmission nodes, posing new challenges in modeling such multi-transmission-node DERAs (M-DERAs). Indeed, assessing the aggregated impact of an M-DERA on power flows is a non-trivial task, because the sensitivities of each transmission line to DERs at different transmission nodes are not identical. Inspired by the distribution factor (DF) based shift factor (SF) aggregation strategy in industry practice, this paper proposes a novel DF-based chance-constrained UC (CCUC) model to determine system optimal operation plans with M-DERAs. DFs, treated as uncertain parameters to describe possible responses of DERs against aggregated dispatch instructions from regional transmission organizations, are modeled via a bounded hetero-dimensional mixture model (BHMM) by leveraging historical DF records distributed on multiple hyperplanes in a bounded space. With this, power flow limits are modeled as chance constraints in CCUC, which is reformulated into a scenarios-based stochastic form and solved by Benders decomposition. The proposed method is tested on an IEEE 24-bus system to illustrate its effectiveness in managing M-DERA integration while ensuring operational economics and mitigating the overloading of transmission lines.

Title: New Paradigm for Unified Near-Field and Far-Field Wireless Communications
Authors: Zhaocheng Wang, Haochen Wu, Yuanbin Chen, Liyang Lu
Abstract: Current Type I and Type II codebooks in fifth generation (5G) wireless communications are limited in supporting the coexistence of far-field and near-field user equipments, as they are exclusively designed for far-field scenarios. To fill this knowledge gap and encourage relevant proposals by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP), this article provides a novel codebook to facilitate a unified paradigm for the coexistence of far-field and near-field contexts. It ensures efficient precoding for all user equipments (UEs), while removing the need for the base station to identify whether one specific UE stays in either near-field or far-field regions. Additionally, our proposed codebook ensures compliance with current 3GPP standards for working flow and reference signals. Simulation results demonstrate the superior performance and versatility of our proposed codebook, validating its effectiveness in unifying near-field and far-field precoding for sixth-generation (6G) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems.

Title: A Large-dimensional Analysis of ESPRIT DoA Estimation: Inconsistency and a Correction via RMT
Authors: Zhengyu Wang, Wei Yang, Xiaoyi Mai, Zenan Ling, Zhenyu Liao, Robert C. Qiu
Abstract: In this paper, we perform asymptotic analyses of the widely used ESPRIT direction-of-arrival (DoA) estimator for large arrays, where the array size $N$ and the number of snapshots $T$ grow to infinity at the same pace. In this large-dimensional regime, the sample covariance matrix (SCM) is known to be a poor eigenspectral estimator of the population covariance. We show that the classical ESPRIT algorithm, that relies on the SCM, and as a consequence of the large-dimensional inconsistency of the SCM, produces inconsistent DoA estimates as $N,T \to \infty$ with $N/T \to c \in (0,\infty)$, for both widely- and closely-spaced DoAs. Leveraging tools from random matrix theory (RMT), we propose an improved G-ESPRIT method and prove its consistency in the same large-dimensional setting. From a technical perspective, we derive a novel bound on the eigenvalue differences between two potentially non-Hermitian random matrices, which may be of independent interest. Numerical simulations are provided to corroborate our theoretical findings.

Title: An Efficient Pre-Processing Method for 6G Dynamic Ray-Tracing Channel Modeling
Authors: Songjiang Yang, Cheng-Xiang Wang, Yinghua Wang, Jie Huang, Yuyang Zhou, el-Hadi M. Aggoune
Abstract: The ray-tracing is often employed in urban areas for channel modeling with high accuracy but encounters a substantial computational complexity for high mobility scenarios. In this paper, we propose a novel pre-processing method for dynamic ray-tracing to reduce the computational burden in high-mobility scenarios by prepending the intersection judgment to the pre-processing stage. The proposed method generates an inter-visibility matrix that establishes visibility relationships among static objects in the environment considering the intersection judgment. Moreover, the inter-visibility matrix can be employed to create the inter-visibility table for mobile transmitters and receivers, which can improve the efficiency of constructing an image tree for the three-dimensional (3D) dynamic ray-tracing method. The results show that the proposed pre-processing method in dynamic ray-tracing has considerable time-saving compared with the traditional method while maintaining the same accuracy. The channel characteristics computed by the proposed method can well match to the channel measurements.

Title: Spectrum Sharing in Satellite-Terrestrial Integrated Networks: Frameworks, Approaches, and Opportunities
Authors: Bodong Shang, Zheng Wang, Xiangyu Li, Chungang Yang, Chao Ren, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: To accommodate the increasing communication needs in non-terrestrial networks (NTNs), wireless users in remote areas may require access to more spectrum than is currently allocated. Terrestrial networks (TNs), such as cellular networks, are deployed in specific areas, but many underused licensed spectrum bands remain in remote areas. Therefore, bringing NTNs to a shared spectrum with TNs can improve network capacity under reasonable interference management. However, in satellite-terrestrial integrated networks (STINs), the comprehensive coverage of a satellite and the unbalanced communication resources of STINs make it challenging to effectively manage mutual interference between NTN and TN. This article presents the fundamentals and prospects of spectrum sharing (SS) in STINs by introducing four SS frameworks, their potential application scenarios, and technical challenges. Furthermore, advanced SS approaches related to interference management in STINs and performance metrics of SS in STINs are introduced. Moreover, a preliminary performance evaluation showcases the potential for sharing the spectrum between NTN and TN. Finally, future research opportunities for SS in STINs are discussed.

Title: Ultrasound-QBench: Can LLMs Aid in Quality Assessment of Ultrasound Imaging?
Authors: Hongyi Miao, Jun Jia, Yankun Cao, Yingjie Zhou, Yanwei Jiang, Zhi Liu, Guangtao Zhai
Abstract: With the dramatic upsurge in the volume of ultrasound examinations, low-quality ultrasound imaging has gradually increased due to variations in operator proficiency and imaging circumstances, imposing a severe burden on diagnosis accuracy and even entailing the risk of restarting the diagnosis in critical cases. To assist clinicians in selecting high-quality ultrasound images and ensuring accurate diagnoses, we introduce Ultrasound-QBench, a comprehensive benchmark that systematically evaluates multimodal large language models (MLLMs) on quality assessment tasks of ultrasound images. Ultrasound-QBench establishes two datasets collected from diverse sources: IVUSQA, consisting of 7,709 images, and CardiacUltraQA, containing 3,863 images. These images encompassing common ultrasound imaging artifacts are annotated by professional ultrasound experts and classified into three quality levels: high, medium, and low. To better evaluate MLLMs, we decompose the quality assessment task into three dimensionalities: qualitative classification, quantitative scoring, and comparative assessment. The evaluation of 7 open-source MLLMs as well as 1 proprietary MLLMs demonstrates that MLLMs possess preliminary capabilities for low-level visual tasks in ultrasound image quality classification. We hope this benchmark will inspire the research community to delve deeper into uncovering and enhancing the untapped potential of MLLMs for medical imaging tasks.

Title: Channel Modeling and Rate Analysis of Optical Inter-Satellite Link (OISL)
Authors: Bodong Shang, Shuo Zhang, Zi Jing Wong
Abstract: Optical inter-satellite links (OISLs) improve connectivity between satellites in space. They offer advantages such as high-throughput data transfer and reduced size, weight, and power requirements compared to traditional radio frequency transmission. However, the channel model and communication performance for long-distance inter-satellite laser transmission still require in-depth study. In this paper, we first develop a channel model for OISL communication within non-terrestrial networks (NTN) by accounting for pointing errors caused by satellite jitter and tracking noise. We derive the distributions of the channel state arising from these pointing errors and calculate their average value. Additionally, we determine the average achievable data rate for OISL communication in NTN and design a cooperative OISL system, highlighting a trade-off between concentrating beam energy and balancing misalignment. We calculate the minimum number of satellites required in cooperative OISLs to achieve a targeted data transmission size while adhering to latency constraints. This involves exploring the balance between the increased data rate of each link and the cumulative latency across all links. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed analytical model and provide insights into the optimal number of satellites needed for cooperative OISLs and the optimal laser frequency to use.

Title: Digital Twin Aided Channel Estimation: Zone-Specific Subspace Prediction and Calibration
Authors: Sadjad Alikhani, Ahmed Alkhateeb
Abstract: Effective channel estimation in sparse and high-dimensional environments is essential for next-generation wireless systems, particularly in large-scale MIMO deployments. This paper introduces a novel framework that leverages digital twins (DTs) as priors to enable efficient zone-specific subspace-based channel estimation (CE). Subspace-based CE significantly reduces feedback overhead by focusing on the dominant channel components, exploiting sparsity in the angular domain while preserving estimation accuracy. While DT channels may exhibit inaccuracies, their coarse-grained subspaces provide a powerful starting point, reducing the search space and accelerating convergence. The framework employs a two-step clustering process on the Grassmann manifold, combined with reinforcement learning (RL), to iteratively calibrate subspaces and align them with real-world counterparts. Simulations show that digital twins not only enable near-optimal performance but also enhance the accuracy of subspace calibration through RL, highlighting their potential as a step towards learnable digital twins.

Title: ICFNet: Integrated Cross-modal Fusion Network for Survival Prediction
Authors: Binyu Zhang, Zhu Meng, Junhao Dong, Fei Su, Zhicheng Zhao
Abstract: Survival prediction is a crucial task in the medical field and is essential for optimizing treatment options and resource allocation. However, current methods often rely on limited data modalities, resulting in suboptimal performance. In this paper, we propose an Integrated Cross-modal Fusion Network (ICFNet) that integrates histopathology whole slide images, genomic expression profiles, patient demographics, and treatment protocols. Specifically, three types of encoders, a residual orthogonal decomposition module and a unification fusion module are employed to merge multi-modal features to enhance prediction accuracy. Additionally, a balanced negative log-likelihood loss function is designed to ensure fair training across different patients. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our ICFNet outperforms state-of-the-art algorithms on five public TCGA datasets, including BLCA, BRCA, GBMLGG, LUAD, and UCEC, and shows its potential to support clinical decision-making and advance precision medicine.

Title: Gaming on Coincident Peak Shaving: Equilibrium and Strategic Behavior
Authors: Liudong Chen, Bolun Xu
Abstract: Coincident peak demand charges are imposed by power system operators or electric utilities when the overall system demand, aggregated across multiple consumers, reaches its peak. These charges incentivize consumers to reduce their demand during peak periods, a practice known as coincident peak shaving. In this paper, we analyze the coincident peak shaving problem through the lens of game theory, developing a theoretical model to examine the impact of strategic consumer behavior on system efficiency. We demonstrate that the game structure exhibits varying characteristics - concave, quasi-concave/discontinuous, or non-concave/discontinuous - depending on the extent of consumers demand-shifting capabilities. For a two-agent, two-period setting, we derive closed-form Nash equilibrium solutions under each condition and generalize our findings to cases with multiple agents. We prove the stability of the equilibrium points and present an algorithm for computing equilibrium outcomes across all game scenarios. We also show that the peak-shaving effectiveness of the game model matches that of the centralized peak-shaving model but with increased levels of anarchy. In the cases of quasi-concave and non-concave game conditions, we analytically demonstrate in the two-agent setting that anarchy increases with consumers flexibility and inequity, as measured by their marginal shifting costs, and we also analyze the influence of the number of agents on anarchy. Finally, we provide numerical simulations to validate our theoretical results.

Title: Ray-Tracing Channel Modeling for LEO Satellite-to-Ground Communication Systems
Authors: Jiahao Ning, Jinhao Deng, Yuanfang Li, Chi Zhao, Jiashu Liu, Songjiang Yang, Yinghua Wang, Jie Huang, Cheng-Xiang Wang
Abstract: Based on the vision of global coverage for sixth-generation (6G) wireless communication systems, the low earth orbit (LEO) satellite-to-ground channel model for urban scenarios has emerged as highly important for the system design. In this paper, we propose an LEO satellite-to-ground channel model through shooting and bouncing rays (SBR) algorithm to analyze the channel characteristics. The orbit of LEO is modeled by the simplified general perturbations 4 (SGP4), and an accurate celestial model is applied to calculate the Doppler shift of multipath in a transmission time window of LEO satellite-to-ground communications. Channel characteristics of LEO satellite-to-ground communications such as the root-mean-square (RMS) delay spread, the Doppler shift, and the received power at different times are obtained. The simulation results show that the received power is only significantly noticeable in the transmission time window when the satellite is close to the receiver. Proposed model validates the effectiveness of ray-tracing in actual LEO satellite-to-ground communication scenarios and extends the calculation of the Doppler shift.

Title: Rydberg Atomic Quantum Receivers for Multi-Target DOA Estimation
Authors: Tierui Gong, Chau Yuen, Chong Meng Samson See, Mérouane Debbah, Lajos Hanzo
Abstract: Quantum sensing technologies have experienced rapid progresses since entering the `second quantum revolution'. Among various candidates, schemes relying on Rydberg atoms exhibit compelling advantages for detecting radio frequency signals. Based on this, Rydberg atomic quantum receivers (RAQRs) have emerged as a promising solution to classical wireless communication and sensing. To harness the advantages and exploit the potential of RAQRs in wireless sensing, we investigate the realization of the direction of arrival (DOA) estimation by RAQRs. Specifically, we first conceive a Rydberg atomic quantum uniform linear array (RAQ-ULA) aided receiver for multi-target detection and propose the corresponding signal model of this sensing system. Furthermore, we propose the Rydberg atomic quantum estimation of signal parameters by designing a rotational invariance based technique termed as RAQ-ESPRIT relying on our model. The proposed algorithm solves the sensor gain mismatch problem, which is due to the presence of the RF local oscillator in the RAQ-ULA and cannot be well addressed by using the conventional ESPRIT. Lastly, we characterize our scheme through numerical simulations.

Title: Diff-Lung: Diffusion-Based Texture Synthesis for Enhanced Pathological Tissue Segmentation in Lung CT Scans
Authors: Rezkellah Noureddine Khiati, Pierre-Yves Brillet, Radu Ispas, Catalin Fetita
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the extent of lung pathological patterns (fibrosis, ground-glass opacity, emphysema, consolidation) is prerequisite for diagnosis and follow-up of interstitial lung diseases. However, segmentation is challenging due to the significant class imbalance between healthy and pathological tissues. This paper addresses this issue by leveraging a diffusion model for data augmentation applied during training an AI model. Our approach generates synthetic pathological tissue patches while preserving essential shape characteristics and intricate details specific to each tissue type. This method enhances the segmentation process by increasing the occurence of underrepresented classes in the training data. We demonstrate that our diffusion-based augmentation technique improves segmentation accuracy across all pathological tissue types, particularly for the less common patterns. This advancement contributes to more reliable automated analysis of lung CT scans, potentially improving clinical decision-making and patient outcomes

Title: A Volumetric Approach to Privacy of Dynamical Systems
Authors: Chuanghong Weng, Ehsan Nekouei
Abstract: Information-theoretic metrics, such as mutual information, have been widely used to evaluate privacy leakage in dynamic systems. However, these approaches are typically limited to stochastic systems and face computational challenges. In this paper, we introduce a novel volumetric framework for analyzing privacy in systems affected by unknown but bounded noise. Our model considers a dynamic system comprising public and private states, where an observation set of the public state is released. An adversary utilizes the observed public state to infer an uncertainty set of the private state, referred to as the inference attack. We define the evolution dynamics of these inference attacks and quantify the privacy level of the private state using the volume of its uncertainty sets. For linear scalar systems, we derive an explicit formulation of the uncertainty set. For multi-dimensional linear systems, we develop an approximate computation method leveraging interval analysis. We investigate the properties of the proposed volumetric privacy measure and demonstrate that it is bounded by the information gain derived from the observation set. Furthermore, we propose an optimization approach to designing privacy filter using randomization and linear programming based on the proposed privacy measure. The effectiveness of the optimal privacy filter design is evaluated through a production-inventory case study, illustrating its robustness against the inference attack.

Title: Region of Interest based Medical Image Compression
Authors: Utkarsh Prakash Srivastava, Toshiaki Fujii
Abstract: The vast volume of medical image data necessitates efficient compression techniques to support remote healthcare services. This paper explores Region of Interest (ROI) coding to address the balance between compression rate and image quality. By leveraging UNET segmentation on the Brats 2020 dataset, we accurately identify tumor regions, which are critical for diagnosis. These regions are then subjected to High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) for compression, enhancing compression rates while preserving essential diagnostic information. This approach ensures that critical image regions maintain their quality, while non-essential areas are compressed more. Our method optimizes storage space and transmission bandwidth, meeting the demands of telemedicine and large-scale medical imaging. Through this technique, we provide a robust solution that maintains the integrity of vital data and improves the efficiency of medical image handling.

Title: Finite-Sample Learning Control for LQR Over Unknown Lossy Channels
Authors: Zhenning Zhang, Liang Xu, Yilin Mo, Xiaofan Wang
Abstract: This paper investigates the Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) problem over an unknown Bernoulli packet drop channel. The unknown packet drop probability is estimated using finite samples, then the estimated probability is used to design a formally equivalent optimal controller. If the estimation error is too large, the estimated controller cannot mean-square stabilize the system. For n-dimensional systems, the upper bound on the estimation error is provided to guarantee the stability of the closed-loop system. And we present an analytical expression for the gap between the performance of the estimated controller and the optimal performance. Next, we derive the upper bound on sample complexity for the stabilizability of the estimated controller. The tailored results with less conservatism are delivered for scalar systems and n-dimensional systems with invertible input matrix. Furthermore, a sufficient condition that does not depend on unknown channel information is provided to determine whether the estimated controller stabilizes the system with a certain probability. Finally, Numerical examples are used to demonstrate our results.

Title: Fluid Antennas: Reshaping Intrinsic Properties for Flexible Radiation Characteristics in Intelligent Wireless Networks
Authors: Wen-Jun Lu, Chun-Xing He, Yongxu Zhu, Kin-Fai Tong, Kai-Kit Wong, Hyundong Shin, Tie Jun Cui
Abstract: Fluid antennas present a relatively new idea for harnessing the fading and interference issues in multiple user wireless systems, such as 6G. Here, we systematically compare their unique radiation beam forming mechanism to the existing multiple-antenna systems in a wireless system. Subsequently, a unified mathematical model for fluid antennas is deduced based on the eigenmode theory. As mathematically derived from the multimode resonant theory, the spectral expansion model of any antennas which occupy variable spaces and have changeable feeding schemes can be generalized as fluid antennas. Non-liquid and liquid fluid antenna examples are presented, simulated and discussed. The symmetry or modal parity of eigenmodes is explored as an additional degree of freedom to design the fluid antennas for future wireless systems. As conceptually deduced and illustrated, the multi-dimensional and continuously adaptive ability of eigenmodes can be considered as the most fundamental intrinsic characteristic of the fluid antenna systems. It opens an uncharted area in the developments of intelligent antennas (IAs), which brings more flexibility to on-demand antenna beam null manipulating techniques for future wireless applications.

Title: Deep Generative Model-Aided Power System Dynamic State Estimation and Reconstruction with Unknown Control Inputs or Data Distributions
Authors: Jianhua Pei, Ping Wang, Jingyu Wang, Dongyuan Shi
Abstract: Fast and robust dynamic state estimation (DSE) is essential for accurately capturing the internal dynamic processes of power systems, and it serves as the foundation for reliably implementing real-time dynamic modeling, monitoring, and control applications. Nonetheless, on one hand, traditional DSE methods based on Kalman filtering or particle filtering have high accuracy requirements for system parameters, control inputs, phasor measurement unit (PMU) data, and centralized DSE communication. Consequently, these methods often face accuracy bottlenecks when dealing with structural or system process errors, unknown control vectors, PMU anomalies, and communication contingencies. On the other hand, deep learning-aided DSE, while parameter-free, often suffers from generalization issues under unforeseen operating conditions. To address these challenges, this paper proposes an effective approach that leverages deep generative models from AI-generated content (AIGC) to assist DSE. The proposed approach employs an encoder-decoder architecture to estimate unknown control input variables, a robust encoder to mitigate the impact of bad PMU data, and latent diffusion model to address communication issues in centralized DSE. Additionally, a lightweight adaptor is designed to quickly adjust the latent vector distribution. Extensive experimental results on the IEEE 39-bus system and the NPCC 140-bus system demonstrate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed method in addressing DSE modeling imperfection, measurement uncertainties, communication contingencies, and unknown distribution challenges, while also proving its ability to reduce data storage and communication resource requirements.

Title: Two-Timescale Channel Estimation for RIS-Aided Near-Field Communications
Authors: Jeongjae Lee, Songnam Hong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the channel estimation problem in reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS)-aided near-field communication systems, where the extremely large number of RIS elements imposes considerable pilot overhead and computational complexity. To address this, we employ a two-timescale channel estimation strategy that exploits the asymmetric coherence times of the RIS-base station (BS) channel and the User-RIS channel. We derive a time-scaling property indicating that for any two effective channels within the longer coherence time, one effective channel can be represented as the product of a vector, referred to as the small-timescale effective channel, and the other effective channel. By utilizing the estimated effective channel along with processed observations from our piecewise beam training, we present an efficient method for estimating subsequent small-timescale effective channels. We theoretically establish the efficacy of the proposed RIS design and demonstrate, through simulations, the superiority of our channel estimation method in terms of pilot overhead and computational complexity compared to existing methods across various realistic channel models.

Title: GLFC: Unified Global-Local Feature and Contrast Learning with Mamba-Enhanced UNet for Synthetic CT Generation from CBCT
Authors: Xianhao Zhou, Jianghao Wu, Huangxuan Zhao, Lei Chen, Shaoting Zhang, Guotai Wang, Guotai Wang
Abstract: Generating synthetic Computed Tomography (CT) images from Cone Beam Computed Tomography (CBCT) is desirable for improving the image quality of CBCT. Existing synthetic CT (sCT) generation methods using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) and Transformers often face difficulties in effectively capturing both global and local features and contrasts for high-quality sCT generation. In this work, we propose a Global-Local Feature and Contrast learning (GLFC) framework for sCT generation. First, a Mamba-Enhanced UNet (MEUNet) is introduced by integrating Mamba blocks into the skip connections of a high-resolution UNet for effective global and local feature learning. Second, we propose a Multiple Contrast Loss (MCL) that calculates synthetic loss at different intensity windows to improve quality for both soft tissues and bone regions. Experiments on the SynthRAD2023 dataset demonstrate that GLFC improved the SSIM of sCT from 77.91% to 91.50% compared with the original CBCT, and significantly outperformed several existing methods for sCT generation.

Title: AC-aware Optimization Framework for Under-Frequency Load Shedding
Authors: Mazen Elsaadany, Muhammad Hamza Ali, Amritanshu Pandey, Mads R.Almassalkhi
Abstract: Under-frequency load shedding (UFLS) prevents system collapse during large disturbances. Increased penetration of distributed energy resources (DERs) and reduced system inertia makes it challenging to design a static UFLS scheme, which relies on preset frequency thresholds and load shed fractions to meet design criteria across all possible operating conditions. Due to non-linearity and traceability issues, previous adaptive UFLS schemes use simplified tractable frequency models that overlook AC network effects such as voltage-dependent load/generation. This paper leverages model order reduction techniques to obtain a higher fidelity low-order model of system frequency dynamics that captures AC network effects while incorporating turbine governor action and their associated limits. The model is then used in a new AC-aware predictive optimization framework to adapt UFLS setpoints periodically based on current operating conditions while minimizing load shed. Validated on a 1,648-bus system with PSS/E simulations, the proposed method meets design criteria under various operating conditions and disturbance scenarios. Furthermore, the framework outperforms conventional static UFLS schemes and adaptive UFLS schemes based on simplified dynamic models.

Title: A Trust-Guided Approach to MR Image Reconstruction with Side Information
Authors: Arda Atalık, Sumit Chopra, Daniel K. Sodickson
Abstract: Reducing MRI scan times can improve patient care and lower healthcare costs. Many acceleration methods are designed to reconstruct diagnostic-quality images from limited sets of acquired $\textit{k}$-space data. This task can be framed as a linear inverse problem (LIP), where, as a result of undersampling, the forward operator may become rank-deficient or exhibit small singular values. This results in ambiguities in reconstruction, in which multiple generally incorrect or non-diagnostic images can map to the same acquired data. To address such ambiguities, it is crucial to incorporate prior knowledge, for example in the form of regularization. Another form of prior knowledge less commonly used in medical imaging is contextual side information garnered from other sources than the current acquisition. Here, we propose the $\textbf{T}$rust-$\textbf{G}$uided $\textbf{V}$ariational $\textbf{N}$etwork $\textbf{(TGVN)}$, a novel end-to-end deep learning framework that effectively integrates side information into LIPs. TGVN eliminates undesirable solutions from the ambiguous space of the forward operator while remaining faithful to the acquired data. We demonstrate its effectiveness in multi-coil, multi-contrast MR image reconstruction, where incomplete or low-quality measurements from one contrast are used as side information to reconstruct high-quality images of another contrast from heavily under-sampled data. Our method is robust across different contrasts, anatomies, and field strengths. Compared to baselines that also utilize side information, TGVN achieves superior image quality at challenging under-sampling levels, drastically speeding up acquisition while minimizing hallucinations. Our approach is also versatile enough to incorporate many different types of side information (including previous scans or even text) into any LIP.

Title: Enabling Efficient Optimal Control of Reconfigurable Battery Systems by Unifying System Modeling and Narrowing Search Space
Authors: Changyou Geng, Dezhi Ren, Xinyi Zheng, Weiji Han
Abstract: Reconfigurable battery systems (RBSs) are emerging as a promising solution to improving fault tolerance, charge and thermal balance, energy delivery, etc. To optimize these performance metrics, high-dimensional nonlinear integer programming problems need to be formulated and solved. During this process, it is necessary to address multiple challenges stemming from nonlinear battery characteristics, discrete switch states, dynamic system configurations, as well as the curse of dimensionality inherent in large-scale systems. Thus, we propose a unified modeling framework to accommodate various potential configurations of an RBS and even to cover different RBS designs, significantly facilitating the topology design and optimization problem formulation for RBSs. Moreover, to solve the formulated RBS problems, the search space is tailored to encompass only feasible SSVs, thereby ensuring safe system operation while substantially curtailing search efforts. These proposed methods, focusing on unifying the system modeling and narrowing the search space, lay a solid foundation for effectively formulating and efficiently solving RBS optimal control problems. The accuracy and effectiveness of the proposed methods are demonstrated by simulation and experimental tests.

Title: DDRM-PR: Fourier Phase Retrieval using Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models
Authors: Mehmet Onurcan Kaya, Figen S. Oktem
Abstract: Diffusion models have demonstrated their utility as learned priors for solving various inverse problems. However, most existing approaches are limited to linear inverse problems. This paper exploits the efficient and unsupervised posterior sampling framework of Denoising Diffusion Restoration Models (DDRM) for the solution of nonlinear phase retrieval problem, which requires reconstructing an image from its noisy intensity-only measurements such as Fourier intensity. The approach combines the model-based alternating-projection methods with the DDRM to utilize pretrained unconditional diffusion priors for phase retrieval. The performance is demonstrated through both simulations and experimental data. Results demonstrate the potential of this approach for improving the alternating-projection methods as well as its limitations.

Title: Single-Channel Distance-Based Source Separation for Mobile GPU in Outdoor and Indoor Environments
Authors: Hanbin Bae, Byungjun Kang, Jiwon Kim, Jaeyong Hwang, Hosang Sung, Hoon-Young Cho
Abstract: This study emphasizes the significance of exploring distance-based source separation (DSS) in outdoor environments. Unlike existing studies that primarily focus on indoor settings, the proposed model is designed to capture the unique characteristics of outdoor audio sources. It incorporates advanced techniques, including a two-stage conformer block, a linear relation-aware self-attention (RSA), and a TensorFlow Lite GPU delegate. While the linear RSA may not capture physical cues as explicitly as the quadratic RSA, the linear RSA enhances the model's context awareness, leading to improved performance on the DSS that requires an understanding of physical cues in outdoor and indoor environments. The experimental results demonstrated that the proposed model overcomes the limitations of existing approaches and considerably enhances energy efficiency and real-time inference speed on mobile devices.

Title: Convergence in On-line Learning of Static and Dynamic Systems
Authors: Torbjörn Wigren, Ruoqi Zhang, Per Mattsson
Abstract: The paper derives new conditions for global convergence of the adaptive moment generation algorithm when applied for on-line, or equivalently, recursive supervised learning of static and dynamic nonlinear systems. The paper also proposes a difference equation based nonlinear dynamic model, that enforces {\em structure} and results in a new type of recurrent neural network. The convergence analysis applies averaging using Ljung's associated differential equation method. It is first proved that the asymptotic update behaviour of the adaptive moment generation algorithm is equivalent to a scaled stochastic gradient update for the standard hyper-parameter setting, or equivalent to a sign-sign update strategy in case the internal filtering of the algorithm is turned off. The analysis is concluded by proving global convergence to the set of parameters that gives a correct input-output description of the true system. The two hyper-parameter settings are evaluated with a Monte-Carlo analysis when the adaptive moment generation algorithm is applied for learning of nonlinear automotive cruise control dynamics. This validates the correct operation of the structured recurrent neural network and confirms the expected reduced convergence speed for the sign-sign update case.

The COVID-19 pandemic has heightened the need for accurate remote medical assessments, emphasizing the importance of precise tongue attribute recognition via telehealth. To address this, we propose a Sign-Oriented multi-label Attributes Detection framework. Our approach begins with an adaptive tongue feature extraction module that standardizes tongue images and mitigates environmental factors. This is followed by a Sign-oriented Network (SignNet) that identifies specific tongue attributes, emulating the diagnostic process of experienced practitioners and enabling comprehensive health evaluations. To validate our methodology, we developed an extensive tongue image dataset specifically designed for telemedicine. Unlike existing datasets, ours is tailored for remote diagnosis, with a comprehensive set of attribute labels. This dataset will be openly available, providing a valuable resource for research. Initial tests have shown improved accuracy in detecting various tongue attributes, highlighting our framework's potential as an essential tool for remote medical assessments.

Title: Benefit evaluation of V2X-enhanced braking in view obstructed crossing use cases
Authors: Jan Zimmermann, Ignacio Llatser, Michael Scherl, Florian Wildschütte, Frank Hofmann
Abstract: If a crash between two vehicles is imminent, an Automatic Emergency Brake (AEB) is activated to avoid or mitigate the accident. However, the trigger mechanism of the AEB relies on the vehicle's onboard sensors, such as radar and cameras, that require a line of sight to detect the crash opponent. If the line of sight is impaired, for example by bad weather or an obstruction, the AEB cannot be activated in time to avoid the crash. To deal with these cases, a 2-stage braking system is proposed, where the first stage consists of a partial brake that is triggered by Vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication. The second stage is composed of the standard AEB that is triggered exclusively by an onboard sensor detection. The performance of this V2X-enhanced 2-stage braking system is analysed in obstructed crossing use cases and the results are compared against the use of an AEB-only system. The benefit is quantitatively assessed by determination of the crash avoidance rate and, if the crash cannot be avoided, by estimation of the crash severity mitigation.

Title: Joint Secrecy Rate Achieving and Authentication Enhancement via Tag-based Encoding in Chaotic UAV Communication Environment
Authors: Junjie Wang, Fang Fang, Gangtao Han, Ning Wang, Xianbin Wang
Abstract: Secure communication is crucial in many emerging systems enabled by unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) communication networks. To protect legitimate communication in a chaotic UAV environment, where both eavesdropping and jamming become straightforward from multiple adversaries with line-of-sight signal propagation, a new reliable and integrated physical layer security mechanism is proposed in this paper for a massive multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) UAV system. Particularly, a physical layer fingerprint, also called a tag, is first embedded into each message for authentication purpose. We then propose to reuse the tag additionally as a reference to encode each message to ensure secrecy for confidentiality enhancement at a low cost. Specifically, we create a new dual-reference symmetric tag generation mechanism by inputting an encoding-insensitive feature of plaintext along with the key into a hash function. At a legitimate receiver, an expected tag, reliable for decoding, can be symmetrically regenerated based on the received ciphertext, and authentication can be performed by comparing the regenerated reference tag to the received tag. However, an illegitimate receiver can only receive the fuzzy tag which can not be used to decode the received message. Additionally, we introduce artificial noise (AN) to degrade eavesdropping to further decrease message leakage. To verify the efficiency of our proposed tag-based encoding (TBE) scheme, we formulate two optimization problems including ergodic sum secrecy rate maximization and authentication fail probability minimization. The power allocation solutions are derived by difference-of-convex (DC) programming and the Lagrange method, respectively. The simulation results demonstrate the superior performance of the proposed TBE approach compared to the prior AN-aided tag embedding scheme.

Title: Distributionally Robust Control Synthesis for Stochastic Systems with Safety and Reach-Avoid Specifications
Authors: Yu Chen, Yuda Li, Shaoyuan Li, Xiang Yin
Abstract: We investigate the problem of synthesizing distributionally robust control policies for stochastic systems under safety and reach-avoid specifications. Using a game-theoretical framework, we consider the setting where the probability distribution of the disturbance at each time step is selected from an ambiguity set defined by the Wasserstein distance. The goal is to synthesize a distributionally robust control policy that ensures the satisfaction probability exceeds a specified threshold under any distribution within the ambiguity set. First, for both safety and reach-avoid specifications, we establish the existence of optimal policies by leveraging the dynamic programming principles. Then we demonstrate how the associated optimization problem can be efficiently solved using the dual representation of Wasserstein distributionally robust optimization. Furthermore, for safety specifications in particular, we introduce a novel concept of distributionally robust control barrier certificates and show how these enable the efficient synthesis of controllers through sum-of-squares programming techniques. Finally, our experimental results reveal that incorporating distributional robustness during the synthesis phase significantly improves the satisfaction probability during online execution, even with limited statistical knowledge of the disturbance distribution.

Title: Noise-Robust Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection Through Self-Supervised Pretraining
Authors: Holger Severin Bovbjerg (1), Jan Østergaard (1), Jesper Jensen (1 and 2), Zheng-Hua Tan (1) ((1) Aalborg University, (2) Oticon A/S)
Abstract: Target-Speaker Voice Activity Detection (TS-VAD) is the task of detecting the presence of speech from a known target-speaker in an audio frame. Recently, deep neural network-based models have shown good performance in this task. However, training these models requires extensive labelled data, which is costly and time-consuming to obtain, particularly if generalization to unseen environments is crucial. To mitigate this, we propose a causal, Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) pretraining framework, called Denoising Autoregressive Predictive Coding (DN-APC), to enhance TS-VAD performance in noisy conditions. We also explore various speaker conditioning methods and evaluate their performance under different noisy conditions. Our experiments show that DN-APC improves performance in noisy conditions, with a general improvement of approx. 2% in both seen and unseen noise. Additionally, we find that FiLM conditioning provides the best overall performance. Representation analysis via tSNE plots reveals robust initial representations of speech and non-speech from pretraining. This underscores the effectiveness of SSL pretraining in improving the robustness and performance of TS-VAD models in noisy environments.

Title: Detecting and Mitigating Adversarial Attacks on Deep Learning-Based MRI Reconstruction Without Any Retraining
Authors: Mahdi Saberi, Chi Zhang, Mehmet Akcakaya
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) methods, especially those based on physics-driven DL, have become the state-of-the-art for reconstructing sub-sampled magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data. However, studies have shown that these methods are susceptible to small adversarial input perturbations, or attacks, resulting in major distortions in the output images. Various strategies have been proposed to reduce the effects of these attacks, but they require retraining and may lower reconstruction quality for non-perturbed/clean inputs. In this work, we propose a novel approach for detecting and mitigating adversarial attacks on MRI reconstruction models without any retraining. Our detection strategy is based on the idea of cyclic measurement consistency. The output of the model is mapped to another set of MRI measurements for a different sub-sampling pattern, and this synthesized data is reconstructed with the same model. Intuitively, without an attack, the second reconstruction is expected to be consistent with the first, while with an attack, disruptions are present. Subsequently, this idea is extended to devise a novel objective function, which is minimized within a small ball around the attack input for mitigation. Experimental results show that our method substantially reduces the impact of adversarial perturbations across different datasets, attack types/strengths and PD-DL networks, and qualitatively and quantitatively outperforms conventional mitigation methods that involve retraining.

Title: Optical Character Recognition using Convolutional Neural Networks for Ashokan Brahmi Inscriptions
Authors: Yash Agrawal, Srinidhi Balasubramanian, Rahul Meena, Rohail Alam, Himanshu Malviya, Rohini P
Abstract: This research paper delves into the development of an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) system for the recognition of Ashokan Brahmi characters using Convolutional Neural Networks. It utilizes a comprehensive dataset of character images to train the models, along with data augmentation techniques to optimize the training process. Furthermore, the paper incorporates image preprocessing to remove noise, as well as image segmentation to facilitate line and character segmentation. The study mainly focuses on three pre-trained CNNs, namely LeNet, VGG-16, and MobileNet and compares their accuracy. Transfer learning was employed to adapt the pre-trained models to the Ashokan Brahmi character dataset. The findings reveal that MobileNet outperforms the other two models in terms of accuracy, achieving a validation accuracy of 95.94% and validation loss of 0.129. The paper provides an in-depth analysis of the implementation process using MobileNet and discusses the implications of the findings. The use of OCR for character recognition is of significant importance in the field of epigraphy, specifically for the preservation and digitization of ancient scripts. The results of this research paper demonstrate the effectiveness of using pre-trained CNNs for the recognition of Ashokan Brahmi characters.

Title: Communication Efficient Cooperative Edge AI via Event-Triggered Computation Offloading
Authors: You Zhou, Changsheng You, Kaibin Huang
Abstract: Rare events, despite their infrequency, often carry critical information and require immediate attentions in mission-critical applications such as autonomous driving, healthcare, and industrial automation. The data-intensive nature of these tasks and their need for prompt responses, combined with designing edge AI (or edge inference), pose significant challenges in systems and techniques. Existing edge inference approaches often suffer from communication bottlenecks due to high-dimensional data transmission and fail to provide timely responses to rare events, limiting their effectiveness for mission-critical applications in the sixth-generation (6G) mobile networks. To overcome these challenges, we propose a channel-adaptive, event-triggered edge-inference framework that prioritizes efficient rare-event processing. Central to this framework is a dual-threshold, multi-exit architecture, which enables early local inference for rare events detected locally while offloading more complex rare events to edge servers for detailed classification. To further enhance the system's performance, we developed a channel-adaptive offloading policy paired with an online algorithm to dynamically determine the optimal confidence thresholds for controlling offloading decisions. The associated optimization problem is solved by reformulating the original non-convex function into an equivalent strongly convex one. Using deep neural network classifiers and real medical datasets, our experiments demonstrate that the proposed framework not only achieves superior rare-event classification accuracy, but also effectively reduces communication overhead, as opposed to existing edge-inference approaches.

Title: KANS: Knowledge Discovery Graph Attention Network for Soft Sensing in Multivariate Industrial Processes
Authors: Hwa Hui Tew, Gaoxuan Li, Fan Ding, Xuewen Luo, Junn Yong Loo, Chee-Ming Ting, Ze Yang Ding, Chee Pin Tan
Abstract: Soft sensing of hard-to-measure variables is often crucial in industrial processes. Current practices rely heavily on conventional modeling techniques that show success in improving accuracy. However, they overlook the non-linear nature, dynamics characteristics, and non-Euclidean dependencies between complex process variables. To tackle these challenges, we present a framework known as a Knowledge discovery graph Attention Network for effective Soft sensing (KANS). Unlike the existing deep learning soft sensor models, KANS can discover the intrinsic correlations and irregular relationships between the multivariate industrial processes without a predefined topology. First, an unsupervised graph structure learning method is introduced, incorporating the cosine similarity between different sensor embedding to capture the correlations between sensors. Next, we present a graph attention-based representation learning that can compute the multivariate data parallelly to enhance the model in learning complex sensor nodes and edges. To fully explore KANS, knowledge discovery analysis has also been conducted to demonstrate the interpretability of the model. Experimental results demonstrate that KANS significantly outperforms all the baselines and state-of-the-art methods in soft sensing performance. Furthermore, the analysis shows that KANS can find sensors closely related to different process variables without domain knowledge, significantly improving soft sensing accuracy.

Title: ST-HCSS: Deep Spatio-Temporal Hypergraph Convolutional Neural Network for Soft Sensing
Authors: Hwa Hui Tew, Fan Ding, Gaoxuan Li, Junn Yong Loo, Chee-Ming Ting, Ze Yang Ding, Chee Pin Tan
Abstract: Higher-order sensor networks are more accurate in characterizing the nonlinear dynamics of sensory time-series data in modern industrial settings by allowing multi-node connections beyond simple pairwise graph edges. In light of this, we propose a deep spatio-temporal hypergraph convolutional neural network for soft sensing (ST-HCSS). In particular, our proposed framework is able to construct and leverage a higher-order graph (hypergraph) to model the complex multi-interactions between sensor nodes in the absence of prior structural knowledge. To capture rich spatio-temporal relationships underlying sensor data, our proposed ST-HCSS incorporates stacked gated temporal and hypergraph convolution layers to effectively aggregate and update hypergraph information across time and nodes. Our results validate the superiority of ST-HCSS compared to existing state-of-the-art soft sensors, and demonstrates that the learned hypergraph feature representations aligns well with the sensor data correlations.

Title: Detecting Music Performance Errors with Transformers
Authors: Benjamin Shiue-Hal Chou, Purvish Jajal, Nicholas John Eliopoulos, Tim Nadolsky, Cheng-Yun Yang, Nikita Ravi, James C. Davis, Kristen Yeon-Ji Yun, Yung-Hsiang Lu
Abstract: Beginner musicians often struggle to identify specific errors in their performances, such as playing incorrect notes or rhythms. There are two limitations in existing tools for music error detection: (1) Existing approaches rely on automatic alignment; therefore, they are prone to errors caused by small deviations between alignment targets.; (2) There is a lack of sufficient data to train music error detection models, resulting in over-reliance on heuristics. To address (1), we propose a novel transformer model, Polytune, that takes audio inputs and outputs annotated music scores. This model can be trained end-to-end to implicitly align and compare performance audio with music scores through latent space representations. To address (2), we present a novel data generation technique capable of creating large-scale synthetic music error datasets. Our approach achieves a 64.1% average Error Detection F1 score, improving upon prior work by 40 percentage points across 14 instruments. Additionally, compared with existing transcription methods repurposed for music error detection, our model can handle multiple instruments. Our source code and datasets are available at this https URL.

Title: RadHop-Net: A Lightweight Radiomics-to-Error Regression for False Positive Reduction In MRI Prostate Cancer Detection
Authors: Vasileios Magoulianitis, Jiaxin Yang, Catherine A. Alexander, C.-C. Jay Kuo
Abstract: Clinically significant prostate cancer (csPCa) is a leading cause of cancer death in men, yet it has a high survival rate if diagnosed early. Bi-parametric MRI (bpMRI) reading has become a prominent screening test for csPCa. However, this process has a high false positive (FP) rate, incurring higher diagnostic costs and patient discomfort. This paper introduces RadHop-Net, a novel and lightweight CNN for FP reduction. The pipeline consists of two stages: Stage 1 employs data driven radiomics to extract candidate ROIs. In contrast, Stage 2 expands the receptive field about each ROI using RadHop-Net to compensate for the predicted error from Stage 1. Moreover, a novel loss function for regression problems is introduced to balance the influence between FPs and true positives (TPs). RadHop-Net is trained in a radiomics-to-error manner, thus decoupling from the common voxel-to-label approach. The proposed Stage 2 improves the average precision (AP) in lesion detection from 0.407 to 0.468 in the publicly available pi-cai dataset, also maintaining a significantly smaller model size than the state-of-the-art.

Title: SMDP-Based Dynamic Batching for Improving Responsiveness and Energy Efficiency of Batch Services
Authors: Yaodan Xu, Sheng Zhou, Zhisheng Niu
Abstract: For servers incorporating parallel computing resources, batching is a pivotal technique for providing efficient and economical services at scale. Parallel computing resources exhibit heightened computational and energy efficiency when operating with larger batch sizes. However, in the realm of online services, the adoption of a larger batch size may lead to longer response times. This paper aims to provide a dynamic batching scheme that delicately balances latency and efficiency. The system is modeled as a batch service queue with size-dependent service times. Then, the design of dynamic batching is formulated as a semi-Markov decision process (SMDP) problem, with the objective of minimizing the weighted sum of average response time and average power consumption. A method is proposed to derive an approximate optimal SMDP solution, representing the chosen dynamic batching policy. By introducing an abstract cost to reflect the impact of "tail" states, the space complexity and the time complexity of the procedure can decrease by 63.5% and 98%, respectively. Numerical results showcase the superiority of SMDP-based batching policies across various parameter setups. Additionally, the proposed scheme exhibits noteworthy flexibility in balancing power consumption and latency.

Title: Vulnerability Liquefaction Mapping in Padang City Based on Cloud Computing Using Optical Satellite Imagery Data
Authors: Pakhrur Razi, Amalia Putri, Josaphat Tetuko Sri Sumantyo, Akmam
Abstract: Liquefaction is a significant geological hazard in earthquake-prone locations like Padang City, Indonesia. The phenomenon happens when saturated soil loses strength owing to seismic shaking, resulting in substantial infrastructure damage. Accurate identification of sensitive locations is critical to catastrophe mitigation. This study aims to map water distribution using optical satellite data and estimate its importance as a crucial element in determining liquefaction vulnerability. The Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI) was used to assess water and vegetation indexes, taking advantage of its sensitivity to water content in varied land surfaces. We recommended using the NIR (near-infrared) and SWIR (short wave infrared) bands with 832.8 nm and 2202.4 nm, respectively, which are sensitive to soil water content. High-resolution satellite data were used to create NDWI maps, highlighting locations with high water saturation. These findings were combined with geological and seismic data to identify liquefaction-prone zones. The study found that locations with high water content, as measured by NDWI, are highly associated with greater liquefaction susceptibility. The findings highlight the importance of water distribution in determining soil behavior during seismic occurrences. This study highlights the value of NDWI as a low-cost and efficient tool for measuring liquefaction vulnerability at the regional level. The technique offers insights into Padang City's urban planning, catastrophe risk reduction, and community preparedness.

Title: Encircling General 2-D Boundaries by Mobile Robots with Collision Avoidance: A Vector Field Guided Approach
Authors: Yuan Tian, Bin Zhang, Xiaodong Shao, David Navarro-Alarcon
Abstract: The ability to automatically encircle boundaries with mobile robots is crucial for tasks such as border tracking and object enclosing. Previous research has primarily focused on regular boundaries, often assuming that their geometric equations are known in advance, which is not often the case in practice. In this paper, we investigate a more general case and propose an algorithm that addresses geometric irregularities of boundaries without requiring prior knowledge of their analytical expressions. To achieve this, we develop a Fourier-based curve fitting method for boundary approximation using sampled points, enabling parametric characterization of general 2-D boundaries. This approach allows star-shaped boundaries to be fitted into polar-angle-based parametric curves, while boundaries of other shapes are handled through decomposition. Then, we design a vector field (VF) to achieve the encirclement of the parameterized boundary, wherein a polar radius error is introduced to measure the robot's ``distance'' to the boundary. The controller is finally synthesized using a control barrier function and quadratic programming to mediate some potentially conflicting specifications: boundary encirclement, obstacle avoidance, and limited actuation. In this manner, the VF-guided reference control not only guides the boundary encircling action, but can also be minimally modified to satisfy obstacle avoidance and input saturation constraints. Simulations and experiments are presented to verify the performance of our new method, which can be applied to mobile robots to perform practical tasks such as cleaning chemical spills and environment monitoring.

Title: Towards a constructive framework for control theory
Authors: Pavel Osinenko
Abstract: This work presents a framework for control theory based on constructive analysis to account for discrepancy between mathematical results and their implementation in a computer, also referred to as computational uncertainty. In control engineering, the latter is usually either neglected or considered submerged into some other type of uncertainty, such as system noise, and addressed within robust control. However, even robust control methods may be compromised when the mathematical objects involved in the respective algorithms fail to exist in exact form and subsequently fail to satisfy the required properties. For instance, in general stabilization using a control Lyapunov function, computational uncertainty may distort stability certificates or even destabilize the system despite robustness of the stabilization routine with regards to system, actuator and measurement noise. In fact, battling numerical problems in practical implementation of controllers is common among control engineers. Such observations indicate that computational uncertainty should indeed be addressed explicitly in controller synthesis and system analysis. The major contribution here is a fairly general framework for proof techniques in analysis and synthesis of control systems based on constructive analysis which explicitly states that every computation be doable only up to a finite precision thus accounting for computational uncertainty. A series of previous works is overviewed, including constructive system stability and stabilization, approximate optimal controls, eigenvalue problems, Caratheodory trajectories, measurable selectors. Additionally, a new constructive version of the Danskin's theorem, which is crucial in adversarial defense, is presented.

Title: Efficient Video-Based ALPR System Using YOLO and Visual Rhythm
Authors: Victor Nascimento Ribeiro, Nina S. T. Hirata
Abstract: Automatic License Plate Recognition (ALPR) involves extracting vehicle license plate information from image or a video capture. These systems have gained popularity due to the wide availability of low-cost surveillance cameras and advances in Deep Learning. Typically, video-based ALPR systems rely on multiple frames to detect the vehicle and recognize the license plates. Therefore, we propose a system capable of extracting exactly one frame per vehicle and recognizing its license plate characters from this singular image using an Optical Character Recognition (OCR) model. Early experiments show that this methodology is viable.

Title: Securing Integrated Sensing and Communication Against a Mobile Adversary: A Stackelberg Game with Deep Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Milad Tatar Mamaghani, Xiangyun Zhou, Nan Yang, A. Lee Swindlehurst
Abstract: In this paper, we study a secure integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) system employing a full-duplex base station with sensing capabilities against a mobile proactive adversarial target$\unicode{x2014}$a malicious unmanned aerial vehicle (M-UAV). We develop a game-theoretic model to enhance communication security, radar sensing accuracy, and power efficiency. The interaction between the legitimate network and the mobile adversary is formulated as a non-cooperative Stackelberg game (NSG), where the M-UAV acts as the leader and strategically adjusts its trajectory to improve its eavesdropping ability while conserving power and avoiding obstacles. In response, the legitimate network, acting as the follower, dynamically allocates resources to minimize network power usage while ensuring required secrecy rates and sensing performance. To address this challenging problem, we propose a low-complexity successive convex approximation (SCA) method for network resource optimization combined with a deep reinforcement learning (DRL) algorithm for adaptive M-UAV trajectory planning through sequential interactions and learning. Simulation results demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed method in addressing security challenges of dynamic ISAC systems in 6G, i.e., achieving a Stackelberg equilibrium with robust performance while mitigating the adversary's ability to intercept network signals.

Title: Design and Benchmarking of A Multi-Modality Sensor for Robotic Manipulation with GAN-Based Cross-Modality Interpretation
Authors: Dandan Zhang, Wen Fan, Jialin Lin, Haoran Li, Qingzheng Cong, Weiru Liu, Nathan F. Lepora, Shan Luo
Abstract: In this paper, we present the design and benchmark of an innovative sensor, ViTacTip, which fulfills the demand for advanced multi-modal sensing in a compact design. A notable feature of ViTacTip is its transparent skin, which incorporates a `see-through-skin' mechanism. This mechanism aims at capturing detailed object features upon contact, significantly improving both vision-based and proximity perception capabilities. In parallel, the biomimetic tips embedded in the sensor's skin are designed to amplify contact details, thus substantially augmenting tactile and derived force perception abilities. To demonstrate the multi-modal capabilities of ViTacTip, we developed a multi-task learning model that enables simultaneous recognition of hardness, material, and textures. To assess the functionality and validate the versatility of ViTacTip, we conducted extensive benchmarking experiments, including object recognition, contact point detection, pose regression, and grating identification. To facilitate seamless switching between various sensing modalities, we employed a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN)-based approach. This method enhances the applicability of the ViTacTip sensor across diverse environments by enabling cross-modality interpretation.

Title: On The Causal Network Of Face-selective Regions In Human Brain During Movie Watching
Authors: Ali Bavafa, Gholam-Ali Hossein-Zadeh
Abstract: Understanding the causal interactions in simple brain tasks, such as face detection, remains a challenging and ambiguous process for researchers. In this study, we address this issue by employing a novel causal discovery method -- Directed Acyclic Graphs via M-matrices for Acyclicity (DAGMA) -- to investigate the causal structure of the brain's face-selective network and gain deeper insights into its mechanism. Using natural movie stimuli, we extract causal network of face-selective regions and analyze how frames containing faces influence this network. Our findings reveal that the presence of faces in the stimuli have causal effect both on the number and strength of causal connections within the network. Additionally, our results highlight the crucial role of subcortical regions in satisfying causal sufficiency, emphasizing its importance in causal studies of brain. This study provides a new perspective on understanding the causal architecture of the face-selective network of the brain, motivating further research on neural causality.

Title: Connecting the Unconnectable through Feedback
Authors: Yimeng Li, Yulin Shao
Abstract: Reliable uplink connectivity remains a persistent challenge for IoT devices, particularly those at the cell edge, due to their limited transmit power and single-antenna configurations. This paper introduces a novel framework aimed at connecting the unconnectable, leveraging real-time feedback from access points (APs) to enhance uplink coverage without increasing the energy consumption of IoT devices. At the core of this approach are feedback channel codes, which enable IoT devices to dynamically adapt their transmission strategies based on AP decoding feedback, thereby reducing the critical uplink SNR required for successful communication. Analytical models are developed to quantify the coverage probability and the number of connectable APs, providing a comprehensive understanding of the system's performance. Numerical results validate the proposed method, demonstrating substantial improvements in coverage range and connectivity, particularly for devices at the cell edge, with up to a 51% boost in connectable APs. Our approach offers a robust and energy-efficient solution to overcoming uplink coverage limitations, enabling IoT networks to connect devices in challenging environments.

Abstract: Gradient descent is the method of choice for training large artificial intelligence systems. As these systems become larger, a better understanding of the mechanisms behind gradient training would allow us to alleviate compute costs and help steer these systems away from harmful behaviors. To that end, we suggest utilizing the circuit perspective brought forward by mechanistic interpretability. After laying out our intuition, we illustrate how it enables us to design a curriculum for efficient learning in a controlled setting. The code is available at \url{this https URL}.

Title: Prepending or Cross-Attention for Speech-to-Text? An Empirical Comparison
Authors: Tsz Kin Lam, Marco Gaido, Sara Papi, Luisa Bentivogli, Barry Haddow
Abstract: Following the remarkable success of Large Language Models (LLMs) in NLP tasks, there is increasing interest in extending their capabilities to speech -- the most common form in communication. To integrate speech into LLMs, one promising approach is dense feature prepending (DFP) which prepends the projected speech representations to the textual representations, allowing end-to-end training with the speech encoder. However, DFP typically requires connecting a text decoder to a speech encoder. This raises questions about the importance of having a sophisticated speech encoder for DFP, and how its performance compares with a standard encoder-decoder (i.e. cross-attention) architecture. In order to perform a controlled architectural comparison, we train all models from scratch, rather than using large pretrained models, and use comparable data and parameter settings, testing speech-to-text recognition (ASR) and translation (ST) on MuST-C v1.0 and CoVoST2 datasets. We study the influence of a speech encoder in DFP. More importantly, we compare DFP and cross-attention under a variety of configurations, such as CTC compression, sequence-level knowledge distillation, generation speed and GPU memory footprint on monolingual, bilingual and multilingual models. Despite the prevalence of DFP over cross-attention, our overall results do not indicate a clear advantage of DFP.

Title: JammingSnake: A follow-the-leader continuum robot with variable stiffness based on fiber jamming
Authors: Chen Qian, Tangyou Liu, Liao Wu
Abstract: Follow-the-leader (FTL) motion is essential for continuum robots operating in fragile and confined environments. It allows the robot to exert minimal force on its surroundings, reducing the risk of damage. This paper presents a novel design of a snake-like robot capable of achieving FTL motion by integrating fiber jamming modules (FJMs). The proposed robot can dynamically adjust its stiffness during propagation and interaction with the environment. An algorithm is developed to independently control the tendon and FJM insertion movements, allowing the robot to maintain its shape while minimizing the forces exerted on surrounding structures. To validate the proposed design, comparative tests were conducted between a traditional tendon-driven robot and the novel design under different configurations. The results demonstrate that our design relies significantly less on contact with the surroundings to maintain its shape. This highlights its potential for safer and more effective operations in delicate environments, such as minimally invasive surgery (MIS) or industrial in-situ inspection.

Title: Fastest Mixing Reversible Markov Chain: Clique Lifted Graphs and Subgraphs
Authors: Saber Jafarizadeh
Abstract: Markov chains are one of the well-known tools for modeling and analyzing stochastic systems. At the same time, they are used for constructing random walks that can achieve a given stationary distribution. This paper is concerned with determining the transition probabilities that optimize the mixing time of the reversible Markov chains towards a given equilibrium distribution. This problem is referred to as the Fastest Mixing Reversible Markov Chain (FMRMC) problem. It is shown that for a given base graph and its clique lifted graph, the FMRMC problem over the clique lifted graph is reducible to the FMRMC problem over the base graph, while the optimal mixing times on both graphs are identical. Based on this result and the solution of the semidefinite programming formulation of the FMRMC problem, the problem has been addressed over a wide variety of topologies with the same base graph. Second, the general form of the FMRMC problem is addressed on stand-alone topologies as well as subgraphs of an arbitrary graph. For subgraphs, it is shown that the optimal transition probabilities over edges of the subgraph can be determined independent of rest of the topology.

Title: MedSegDiffNCA: Diffusion Models With Neural Cellular Automata for Skin Lesion Segmentation
Authors: Avni Mittal, John Kalkhof, Anirban Mukhopadhyay, Arnav Bhavsar
Abstract: Denoising Diffusion Models (DDMs) are widely used for high-quality image generation and medical image segmentation but often rely on Unet-based architectures, leading to high computational overhead, especially with high-resolution images. This work proposes three NCA-based improvements for diffusion-based medical image segmentation. First, Multi-MedSegDiffNCA uses a multilevel NCA framework to refine rough noise estimates generated by lower level NCA models. Second, CBAM-MedSegDiffNCA incorporates channel and spatial attention for improved segmentation. Third, MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA combines these methods with a new RGB channel loss for semantic guidance. Evaluations on Lesion segmentation show that MultiCBAM-MedSegDiffNCA matches Unet-based model performance with dice score of 87.84% while using 60-110 times fewer parameters, offering a more efficient solution for low resource medical settings.

Title: Reducing the Gap Between Pretrained Speech Enhancement and Recognition Models Using a Real Speech-Trained Bridging Module
Authors: Zhongjian Cui, Chenrui Cui, Tianrui Wang, Mengnan He, Hao Shi, Meng Ge, Caixia Gong, Longbiao Wang, Jianwu Dang
Abstract: The information loss or distortion caused by single-channel speech enhancement (SE) harms the performance of automatic speech recognition (ASR). Observation addition (OA) is an effective post-processing method to improve ASR performance by balancing noisy and enhanced speech. Determining the OA coefficient is crucial. However, the currently supervised OA coefficient module, called the bridging module, only utilizes simulated noisy speech for training, which has a severe mismatch with real noisy speech. In this paper, we propose training strategies to train the bridging module with real noisy speech. First, DNSMOS is selected to evaluate the perceptual quality of real noisy speech with no need for the corresponding clean label to train the bridging module. Additional constraints during training are introduced to enhance the robustness of the bridging module further. Each utterance is evaluated by the ASR back-end using various OA coefficients to obtain the word error rates (WERs). The WERs are used to construct a multidimensional vector. This vector is introduced into the bridging module with multi-task learning and is used to determine the optimal OA coefficients. The experimental results on the CHiME-4 dataset show that the proposed methods all had significant improvement compared with the simulated data trained bridging module, especially under real evaluation sets.

Title: Blockage-Aware UAV-Assisted Wireless Data Harvesting With Building Avoidance
Authors: Gitae Park, Kanghyun Heo, Kisong Lee
Abstract: Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) offer dynamic trajectory control, enabling them to avoid obstacles and establish line-of-sight (LoS) wireless channels with ground nodes (GNs), unlike traditional ground-fixed base stations. This study addresses the joint optimization of scheduling and three-dimensional (3D) trajectory planning for UAV-assisted wireless data harvesting. The objective is to maximize the minimum uplink throughput among GNs while accounting for signal blockages and building avoidance. To achieve this, we first present mathematical models designed to avoid cuboid-shaped buildings and to determine wireless signal blockage by buildings through rigorous mathematical proof. The optimization problem is formulated as nonconvex mixed-integer nonlinear programming and solved using advanced techniques. Specifically, the problem is decomposed into convex subproblems via quadratic transform and successive convex approximation. Building avoidance and signal blockage constraints are incorporated using the separating hyperplane method and an approximated indicator function. These subproblems are then iteratively solved using the block coordinate descent algorithm. Simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed approach. The UAV dynamically adjusts its trajectory and scheduling policy to maintain LoS channels with GNs, significantly enhancing network throughput compared to existing schemes. Moreover, the trajectory of the UAV adheres to building avoidance constraints for its continuous trajectory, ensuring uninterrupted operation and compliance with safety requirements.

Title: Neural Reflectance Fields for Radio-Frequency Ray Tracing
Authors: Haifeng Jia, Xinyi Chen, Yichen Wei, Yifei Sun, Yibo Pi
Abstract: Ray tracing is widely employed to model the propagation of radio-frequency (RF) signal in complex environment. The modelling performance greatly depends on how accurately the target scene can be depicted, including the scene geometry and surface material properties. The advances in computer vision and LiDAR make scene geometry estimation increasingly accurate, but there still lacks scalable and efficient approaches to estimate the material reflectivity in real-world environment. In this work, we tackle this problem by learning the material reflectivity efficiently from the path loss of the RF signal from the transmitters to receivers. Specifically, we want the learned material reflection coefficients to minimize the gap between the predicted and measured powers of the receivers. We achieve this by translating the neural reflectance field from optics to RF domain by modelling both the amplitude and phase of RF signals to account for the multipath effects. We further propose a differentiable RF ray tracing framework that optimizes the neural reflectance field to match the signal strength measurements. We simulate a complex real-world environment for experiments and our simulation results show that the neural reflectance field can successfully learn the reflection coefficients for all incident angles. As a result, our approach achieves better accuracy in predicting the powers of receivers with significantly less training data compared to existing approaches.

Title: LoRaConnect: Unlocking HTTP Potential on LoRa Backbones for Remote Areas and Ad-Hoc Networks
Authors: Atonu Ghosh, Sudip Misra
Abstract: The minimal infrastructure requirements of LoRa make it suitable for deployments in remote and disaster-stricken areas. Concomitantly, the modern era is witnessing the proliferation of web applications in all aspects of human life, including IoT and other network services. Contemporary IoT and network solutions heavily rely on web applications to render services. However, despite the recent research and development pivoted around LoRa, there is still a lack of studies focusing on web application access over LoRa networks. Specifically, technical challenges like payload size limitation, low data rate, and contentions in multi-user setups limit the applicability of LoRa for web applications. Hence, we propose LoRaWeb, which enables web access over LoRa networks. The LoRaWeb hardware tethers a WiFi hotspot to which the client devices connect and access the web pages using a web browser. LoRa backbone of the network handles the web page transmission from the requester and receiver devices. LoRaWeb implements a synchronization procedure to address the aforementioned challenges for effective message exchange between requesters and responders. The system implements a caching mechanism to reduce latency and contention. Additionally, it implements a message-slicing mechanism in the application layer to overcome the hardware limitations on the message length. The actual hardware-based implementation results indicate seamless deployment, and the results indicate an average access time of ~$0.95 S$ for a $1.5 KB$ and ~$6 S$ for a $10 KB$ size web page.

Title: IRIS: A Bayesian Approach for Image Reconstruction in Radio Interferometry with expressive Score-Based priors
Authors: Noé Dia, M. J. Yantovski-Barth, Alexandre Adam, Micah Bowles, Laurence Perreault-Levasseur, Yashar Hezaveh, Anna Scaife
Abstract: Inferring sky surface brightness distributions from noisy interferometric data in a principled statistical framework has been a key challenge in radio astronomy. In this work, we introduce Imaging for Radio Interferometry with Score-based models (IRIS). We use score-based models trained on optical images of galaxies as an expressive prior in combination with a Gaussian likelihood in the uv-space to infer images of protoplanetary disks from visibility data of the DSHARP survey conducted by ALMA. We demonstrate the advantages of this framework compared with traditional radio interferometry imaging algorithms, showing that it produces plausible posterior samples despite the use of a misspecified galaxy prior. Through coverage testing on simulations, we empirically evaluate the accuracy of this approach to generate calibrated posterior samples.

Title: Can Impressions of Music be Extracted from Thumbnail Images?
Authors: Takashi Harada, Takehiro Motomitsu, Katsuhiko Hayashi, Yusuke Sakai, Hidetaka Kamigaito
Abstract: In recent years, there has been a notable increase in research on machine learning models for music retrieval and generation systems that are capable of taking natural language sentences as inputs. However, there is a scarcity of large-scale publicly available datasets, consisting of music data and their corresponding natural language descriptions known as music captions. In particular, non-musical information such as suitable situations for listening to a track and the emotions elicited upon listening is crucial for describing music. This type of information is underrepresented in existing music caption datasets due to the challenges associated with extracting it directly from music data. To address this issue, we propose a method for generating music caption data that incorporates non-musical aspects inferred from music thumbnail images, and validated the effectiveness of our approach through human evaluations. Additionally, we created a dataset with approximately 360,000 captions containing non-musical aspects. Leveraging this dataset, we trained a music retrieval model and demonstrated its effectiveness in music retrieval tasks through evaluation.

Title: UDMC: Unified Decision-Making and Control Framework for Urban Autonomous Driving with Motion Prediction of Traffic Participants
Authors: Haichao Liu, Kai Chen, Yulin Li, Zhenmin Huang, Ming Liu, Jun Ma
Abstract: Current autonomous driving systems often struggle to balance decision-making and motion control while ensuring safety and traffic rule compliance, especially in complex urban environments. Existing methods may fall short due to separate handling of these functionalities, leading to inefficiencies and safety compromises. To address these challenges, we introduce UDMC, an interpretable and unified Level 4 autonomous driving framework. UDMC integrates decision-making and motion control into a single optimal control problem (OCP), considering the dynamic interactions with surrounding vehicles, pedestrians, road lanes, and traffic signals. By employing innovative potential functions to model traffic participants and regulations, and incorporating a specialized motion prediction module, our framework enhances on-road safety and rule adherence. The integrated design allows for real-time execution of flexible maneuvers suited to diverse driving scenarios. High-fidelity simulations conducted in CARLA exemplify the framework's computational efficiency, robustness, and safety, resulting in superior driving performance when compared against various baseline models. Our open-source project is available at this https URL.

Title: Energy Optimization of Multi-task DNN Inference in MEC-assisted XR Devices: A Lyapunov-Guided Reinforcement Learning Approach
Authors: Yanzan Sun, Jiacheng Qiu, Guangjin Pan, Shugong Xu, Shunqing Zhang, Xiaoyun Wang, Shuangfeng Han
Abstract: Extended reality (XR), blending virtual and real worlds, is a key application of future networks. While AI advancements enhance XR capabilities, they also impose significant computational and energy challenges on lightweight XR devices. In this paper, we developed a distributed queue model for multi-task DNN inference, addressing issues of resource competition and queue coupling. In response to the challenges posed by the high energy consumption and limited resources of XR devices, we designed a dual time-scale joint optimization strategy for model partitioning and resource allocation, formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. This strategy aims to minimize the total energy consumption of XR devices while ensuring queue stability and adhering to computational and communication resource constraints. To tackle this problem, we devised a Lyapunov-guided Proximal Policy Optimization algorithm, named LyaPPO. Numerical results demonstrate that the LyaPPO algorithm outperforms the baselines, achieving energy conservation of 24.79% to 46.14% under varying resource capacities. Specifically, the proposed algorithm reduces the energy consumption of XR devices by 24.29% to 56.62% compared to baseline algorithms.

Title: Rotatable Antenna Enabled Wireless Communication: Modeling and Optimization
Authors: Beixiong Zheng, Qingjie Wu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: Fluid antenna system (FAS) and movable antenna (MA) have recently emerged as promising technologies to exploit new degrees of freedom (DoFs) in the spatial domain, which have attracted growing attention in wireless communication. In this paper, we propose a new rotatable antenna (RA) model to improve the performance of wireless communication systems. Different from conventional fixed antennas, the proposed RA system can flexibly alter the three-dimensional (3D) boresight direction of each antenna independently by adjusting its deflection angles to achieve a desired array directional gain pattern. Specifically, we investigate an RA-enabled uplink communication system, where the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of all RAs at the base station (BS) are jointly optimized to maximize the minimum signal-to-interference-plus-noise ratio (SINR) among all the users. In the special single-user and free-space propagation setup, the optimal deflection angles of RAs are derived in closed form with the maximum-ratio combining (MRC) beamformer applied at the BS. Moreover, we analyze the asymptotic performance with an infinite number of antennas based on this solution, which theoretically proves that the RA system can achieve a higher array gain as compared to the fixed-antenna system. In the general multi-user and multi-path channel setup, we first propose an alternating optimization (AO) algorithm to alternately optimize the receive beamforming and the deflection angles of RAs in an iterative manner. Then, a two-stage algorithm that solves the formulated problem without the need for iteration is further proposed to reduce computational complexity. Simulation results are provided to validate our analytical results and demonstrate that the proposed RA system can significantly outperform other benchmark schemes.

Title: A System for Melodic Harmonization using Schoenberg Regions, Giant Steps, and Church Modes
Authors: Frederick Fernandes
Abstract: Systems such as Microsoft Songsmith automatically assign chords and harmony to a melody by minimizing the dissonance across all chord changes. Although this produces harmonious music, it is not what practicing musicians do. In this paper, I describe Harmonizer, a prototype system for melodic harmonization. Harmonizer uses Schoenberg's chart of regions as the underlying data structure that allows harmonization using several different methods. Because the chart reveals inter-chordal relationships, the harmonizations may be programmed to emphasize desired relationships. In the prototype Harmonizer, I also explore recent signal-processing methods that enable songwriters to easily input a melody by singing or by playing a musical instrument. The prototype Harmonizer is available on GitHub and a video demonstrating its distinctive harmonizations is on YouTube as explained in the Results section of the paper.

Title: Markov Decision Processes for Satellite Maneuver Planning and Collision Avoidance
Authors: William Kuhl, Jun Wang, Duncan Eddy, Mykel Kochenderfer
Abstract: This paper presents a decentralized, online planning approach for scalable maneuver planning for large constellations. While decentralized, rule-based strategies have facilitated efficient scaling, optimal decision-making algorithms for satellite maneuvers remain underexplored. As commercial satellite constellations grow, there are benefits of online maneuver planning, such as using real-time trajectory predictions to improve state knowledge, thereby reducing maneuver frequency and conserving fuel. We address this gap in the research by treating the satellite maneuver planning problem as a Markov decision process (MDP). This approach enables the generation of optimal maneuver policies online with low computational cost. This formulation is applied to the low Earth orbit collision avoidance problem, considering the problem of an active spacecraft deciding to maneuver to avoid a non-maneuverable object. We test the policies we generate in a simulated low Earth orbit environment, and compare the results to traditional rule-based collision avoidance techniques.

Title: CCStereo: Audio-Visual Contextual and Contrastive Learning for Binaural Audio Generation
Authors: Yuanhong Chen, Kazuki Shimada, Christian Simon, Yukara Ikemiya, Takashi Shibuya, Yuki Mitsufuji
Abstract: Binaural audio generation (BAG) aims to convert monaural audio to stereo audio using visual prompts, requiring a deep understanding of spatial and semantic information. However, current models risk overfitting to room environments and lose fine-grained spatial details. In this paper, we propose a new audio-visual binaural generation model incorporating an audio-visual conditional normalisation layer that dynamically aligns the mean and variance of the target difference audio features using visual context, along with a new contrastive learning method to enhance spatial sensitivity by mining negative samples from shuffled visual features. We also introduce a cost-efficient way to utilise test-time augmentation in video data to enhance performance. Our approach achieves state-of-the-art generation accuracy on the FAIR-Play and MUSIC-Stereo benchmarks.

Title: Local Reactive Control for Mobile Manipulators with Whole-Body Safety in Complex Environments
Authors: Chunxin Zheng, Yulin Li, Zhiyuan Song, Zhihai Bi, Jinni Zhou, Boyu Zhou, Jun Ma
Abstract: Mobile manipulators typically encounter significant challenges in navigating narrow, cluttered environments due to their high-dimensional state spaces and complex kinematics. While reactive methods excel in dynamic settings, they struggle to efficiently incorporate complex, coupled constraints across the entire state space. In this work, we present a novel local reactive controller that reformulates the time-domain single-step problem into a multi-step optimization problem in the spatial domain, leveraging the propagation of a serial kinematic chain. This transformation facilitates the formulation of customized, decoupled link-specific constraints, which is further solved efficiently with augmented Lagrangian differential dynamic programming (AL-DDP). Our approach naturally absorbs spatial kinematic propagation in the forward pass and processes all link-specific constraints simultaneously during the backward pass, enhancing both constraint management and computational efficiency. Notably, in this framework, we formulate collision avoidance constraints for each link using accurate geometric models with extracted free regions, and this improves the maneuverability of the mobile manipulator in narrow, cluttered spaces. Experimental results showcase significant improvements in safety, efficiency, and task completion rates. These findings underscore the robustness of the proposed method, particularly in narrow, cluttered environments where conventional approaches could falter.

Title: Samba-asr state-of-the-art speech recognition leveraging structured state-space models
Authors: Syed Abdul Gaffar Shakhadri, Kruthika KR, Kartik Basavaraj Angadi
Abstract: We propose Samba ASR, the first state-of-the-art Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model leveraging the novel Mamba architecture as both encoder and decoder, built on the foundation of state-space models (SSMs). Unlike transformer-based ASR models, which rely on self-attention mechanisms to capture dependencies, Samba ASR effectively models both local and global temporal dependencies using efficient state-space dynamics, achieving remarkable performance gains. By addressing the limitations of transformers, such as quadratic scaling with input length and difficulty in handling long-range dependencies, Samba ASR achieves superior accuracy and efficiency. Experimental results demonstrate that Samba ASR surpasses existing open-source transformer-based ASR models across various standard benchmarks, establishing it as the new state of the art in ASR. Extensive evaluations on benchmark datasets show significant improvements in Word Error Rate (WER), with competitive performance even in low-resource scenarios. Furthermore, the computational efficiency and parameter optimization of the Mamba architecture make Samba ASR a scalable and robust solution for diverse ASR tasks. Our contributions include: A new Samba ASR architecture demonstrating the superiority of SSMs over transformer-based models for speech sequence processing. A comprehensive evaluation on public benchmarks showcasing state-of-the-art performance. An analysis of computational efficiency, robustness to noise, and sequence generalization. This work highlights the viability of Mamba SSMs as a transformer-free alternative for efficient and accurate ASR. By leveraging state-space modeling advancements, Samba ASR sets a new benchmark for ASR performance and future research.

Title: Constrained Multi-Modal Density Control of Linear Systems via Covariance Steering Theory
Authors: Isin M Balci, Efstathios Bakolas
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate finite-horizon optimal density steering problems for discrete-time stochastic linear dynamical systems whose state probability densities can be represented as Gaussian Mixture Models (GMMs). Our goal is to compute optimal controllers that can ensure that the terminal state distribution will match the desired distribution exactly (hard-constrained version) or closely (soft-constrained version) where in the latter case we employ a Wasserstein like metric that can measure the distance between different GMMs. Our approach relies on a class of randomized control policies which allow us to reformulate the proposed density steering problems as finite-dimensional optimization problems, and in particular, linear and bilinear programs. Additionally, we explore more general density steering problems based on the approximation of general distributions by GMMs and characterize bounds for the error between the terminal distribution under our policy and the approximated GMM terminal state distribution. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through non-trivial numerical experiments.

Title: Spectrum Sharing in 6G Space-Ground Integrated Networks: A Ground Protection Zone-Based Design
Authors: Bodong Shang, Xiangyu Li, Zheng Wang, Junchao Ma
Abstract: Space-ground integrated network (SGIN) has been envisioned as a competitive solution for large scale and wide coverage of future wireless networks. By integrating both the non-terrestrial network (NTN) and the terrestrial network (TN), SGIN can provide high speed and omnipresent wireless network access for the users using the predefined licensed spectrums. Considering the scarcity of the spectrum resource and the low spectrum efficiency of the SGIN, we enable the NTN and TN to share the spectrum to improve overall system performance, i.e., weighted-sum area data rate (WS-ADR). However, mutual interference between NTN and TN is often inevitable and thus causes SGIN performance degradation. In this work, we consider a ground protection zone for the TN base stations, in which the NTN users are only allowed to use the NTN reserved spectrum to mitigate the NTN and TN mutual interference. We analytically derive the coverage probability and area data rate (ADR) of the typical users and study the performance under various protection zone sizes and spectrum allocation parameter settings. Simulation and numerical results demonstrate that the WS-ADR could be maximized by selecting the appropriate radius of protection zone and bandwidth allocation factor in the SGIN.

Title: Towards HRTF Personalization using Denoising Diffusion Models
Authors: Juan Camilo Albarracín Sánchez, Luca Comanducci, Mirco Pezzoli, Fabio Antonacci
Abstract: Head-Related Transfer Functions (HRTFs) have fundamental applications for realistic rendering in immersive audio scenarios. However, they are strongly subject-dependent as they vary considerably depending on the shape of the ears, head and torso. Thus, personalization procedures are required for accurate binaural rendering. Recently, Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), a class of generative learning techniques, have been applied to solve a variety of signal processing-related problems. In this paper, we propose a first approach for using DDPM conditioned on anthropometric measurements to generate personalized Head-Related Impulse Response (HRIR), the time-domain representation of HRTF. The results show the feasibility of DDPMs for HRTF personalization obtaining performance in line with state-of-the-art models.

Title: MSA-CNN: A Lightweight Multi-Scale CNN with Attention for Sleep Stage Classification
Authors: Stephan Goerttler, Yucheng Wang, Emadeldeen Eldele, Min Wu, Fei He
Abstract: Recent advancements in machine learning-based signal analysis, coupled with open data initiatives, have fuelled efforts in automatic sleep stage classification. Despite the proliferation of classification models, few have prioritised reducing model complexity, which is a crucial factor for practical applications. In this work, we introduce Multi-Scale and Attention Convolutional Neural Network (MSA-CNN), a lightweight architecture featuring as few as ~10,000 parameters. MSA-CNN leverages a novel multi-scale module employing complementary pooling to eliminate redundant filter parameters and dense convolutions. Model complexity is further reduced by separating temporal and spatial feature extraction and using cost-effective global spatial convolutions. This separation of tasks not only reduces model complexity but also mirrors the approach used by human experts in sleep stage scoring. We evaluated both small and large configurations of MSA-CNN against nine state-of-the-art baseline models across three public datasets, treating univariate and multivariate models separately. Our evaluation, based on repeated cross-validation and re-evaluation of all baseline models, demonstrated that the large MSA-CNN outperformed all baseline models on all three datasets in terms of accuracy and Cohen's kappa, despite its significantly reduced parameter count. Lastly, we explored various model variants and conducted an in-depth analysis of the key modules and techniques, providing deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms. The code for our models, baselines, and evaluation procedures is available at this https URL.

Title: Online Collaborative Resource Allocation and Task Offloading for Multi-access Edge Computing
Authors: Geng Sun, Minghua Yuan, Zemin Sun, Jiacheng Wang, Hongyang Du, Dusit Niyato, Zhu Han, Dong In Kim
Abstract: Multi-access edge computing (MEC) is emerging as a promising paradigm to provide flexible computing services close to user devices (UDs). However, meeting the computation-hungry and delay-sensitive demands of UDs faces several challenges, including the resource constraints of MEC servers, inherent dynamic and complex features in the MEC system, and difficulty in dealing with the time-coupled and decision-coupled optimization. In this work, we first present an edge-cloud collaborative MEC architecture, where the MEC servers and cloud collaboratively provide offloading services for UDs. Moreover, we formulate an energy-efficient and delay-aware optimization problem (EEDAOP) to minimize the energy consumption of UDs under the constraints of task deadlines and long-term queuing delays. Since the problem is proved to be non-convex mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP), we propose an online joint communication resource allocation and task offloading approach (OJCTA). Specifically, we transform EEDAOP into a real-time optimization problem by employing the Lyapunov optimization framework. Then, to solve the real-time optimization problem, we propose a communication resource allocation and task offloading optimization method by employing the Tammer decomposition mechanism, convex optimization method, bilateral matching mechanism, and dependent rounding method. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed OJCTA can achieve superior system performance compared to the benchmark approaches.

Title: SYKI-SVC: Advancing Singing Voice Conversion with Post-Processing Innovations and an Open-Source Professional Testset
Authors: Yiquan Zhou, Wenyu Wang, Hongwu Ding, Jiacheng Xu, Jihua Zhu, Xin Gao, Shihao Li
Abstract: Singing voice conversion aims to transform a source singing voice into that of a target singer while preserving the original lyrics, melody, and various vocal techniques. In this paper, we propose a high-fidelity singing voice conversion system. Our system builds upon the SVCC T02 framework and consists of three key components: a feature extractor, a voice converter, and a post-processor. The feature extractor utilizes the ContentVec and Whisper models to derive F0 contours and extract speaker-independent linguistic features from the input singing voice. The voice converter then integrates the extracted timbre, F0, and linguistic content to synthesize the target speaker's waveform. The post-processor augments high-frequency information directly from the source through simple and effective signal processing to enhance audio quality. Due to the lack of a standardized professional dataset for evaluating expressive singing conversion systems, we have created and made publicly available a specialized test set. Comparative evaluations demonstrate that our system achieves a remarkably high level of naturalness, and further analysis confirms the efficacy of our proposed system design.

Title: Piano Transcription by Hierarchical Language Modeling with Pretrained Roll-based Encoders
Authors: Dichucheng Li, Yongyi Zang, Qiuqiang Kong
Abstract: Automatic Music Transcription (AMT), aiming to get musical notes from raw audio, typically uses frame-level systems with piano-roll outputs or language model (LM)-based systems with note-level predictions. However, frame-level systems require manual thresholding, while the LM-based systems struggle with long sequences. In this paper, we propose a hybrid method combining pre-trained roll-based encoders with an LM decoder to leverage the strengths of both methods. Besides, our approach employs a hierarchical prediction strategy, first predicting onset and pitch, then velocity, and finally offset. The hierarchical prediction strategy reduces computational costs by breaking down long sequences into different hierarchies. Evaluated on two benchmark roll-based encoders, our method outperforms traditional piano-roll outputs 0.01 and 0.022 in onset-offset-velocity F1 score, demonstrating its potential as a performance-enhancing plug-in for arbitrary roll-based music transcription encoder. We release the code of this work at this https URL.

Title: Enhancing Multirotor Drone Efficiency: Exploring Minimum Energy Consumption Rate of Forward Flight under Varying Payload
Authors: Ayush Patnaik, Nicolas Michel, Xinfan Lin
Abstract: Multirotor unmanned aerial vehicle is a prevailing type of aircraft with wide real-world applications. Energy efficiency is a critical aspect of its performance, determining the range and duration of the missions that can be performed. In this study, we show both analytically and numerically that the optimum of a key energy efficiency index in forward flight, namely energy per meter traveled per unit mass, is a constant under different vehicle mass (including payload). Note that this relationship is only true under the optimal forward velocity that minimizes the energy consumption (under different mass), but not under arbitrary velocity. The study is based on a previously developed model capturing the first-principle energy dynamics of the multirotor, and a key step is to prove that the pitch angle under optimal velocity is a constant. By employing both analytical derivation and validation studies, the research provides critical insights into the optimization of multirotor energy efficiency, and facilitate the development of flight control strategies to extend mission duration and range.

Title: Deep-Relative-Trust-Based Diffusion for Decentralized Deep Learning
Authors: Muyun Li, Aaron Fainman, Stefan Vlaski
Abstract: Decentralized learning strategies allow a collection of agents to learn efficiently from local data sets without the need for central aggregation or orchestration. Current decentralized learning paradigms typically rely on an averaging mechanism to encourage agreement in the parameter space. We argue that in the context of deep neural networks, which are often over-parameterized, encouraging consensus of the neural network outputs, as opposed to their parameters can be more appropriate. This motivates the development of a new decentralized learning algorithm, termed DRT diffusion, based on deep relative trust (DRT), a recently introduced similarity measure for neural networks. We provide convergence analysis for the proposed strategy, and numerically establish its benefit to generalization, especially with sparse topologies, in an image classification task.

Title: FaceSpeak: Expressive and High-Quality Speech Synthesis from Human Portraits of Different Styles
Authors: Tian-Hao Zhang, Jiawei Zhang, Jun Wang, Xinyuan Qian, Xu-Cheng Yin
Abstract: Humans can perceive speakers' characteristics (e.g., identity, gender, personality and emotion) by their appearance, which are generally aligned to their voice style. Recently, vision-driven Text-to-speech (TTS) scholars grounded their investigations on real-person faces, thereby restricting effective speech synthesis from applying to vast potential usage scenarios with diverse characters and image styles. To solve this issue, we introduce a novel FaceSpeak approach. It extracts salient identity characteristics and emotional representations from a wide variety of image styles. Meanwhile, it mitigates the extraneous information (e.g., background, clothing, and hair color, etc.), resulting in synthesized speech closely aligned with a character's persona. Furthermore, to overcome the scarcity of multi-modal TTS data, we have devised an innovative dataset, namely Expressive Multi-Modal TTS, which is diligently curated and annotated to facilitate research in this domain. The experimental results demonstrate our proposed FaceSpeak can generate portrait-aligned voice with satisfactory naturalness and quality.

Title: Classifier-Guided Captioning Across Modalities
Authors: Ariel Shaulov, Tal Shaharabany, Eitan Shaar, Gal Chechik, Lior Wolf
Abstract: Most current captioning systems use language models trained on data from specific settings, such as image-based captioning via Amazon Mechanical Turk, limiting their ability to generalize to other modality distributions and contexts. This limitation hinders performance in tasks like audio or video captioning, where different semantic cues are needed. Addressing this challenge is crucial for creating more adaptable and versatile captioning frameworks applicable across diverse real-world contexts. In this work, we introduce a method to adapt captioning networks to the semantics of alternative settings, such as capturing audibility in audio captioning, where it is crucial to describe sounds and their sources. Our framework consists of two main components: (i) a frozen captioning system incorporating a language model (LM), and (ii) a text classifier that guides the captioning system. The classifier is trained on a dataset automatically generated by GPT-4, using tailored prompts specifically designed to enhance key aspects of the generated captions. Importantly, the framework operates solely during inference, eliminating the need for further training of the underlying captioning model. We evaluate the framework on various models and modalities, with a focus on audio captioning, and report promising results. Notably, when combined with an existing zero-shot audio captioning system, our framework improves its quality and sets state-of-the-art performance in zero-shot audio captioning.

Title: Multimodal Machine Learning Can Predict Videoconference Fluidity and Enjoyment
Authors: Andrew Chang, Viswadruth Akkaraju, Ray McFadden Cogliano, David Poeppel, Dustin Freeman
Abstract: Videoconferencing is now a frequent mode of communication in both professional and informal settings, yet it often lacks the fluidity and enjoyment of in-person conversation. This study leverages multimodal machine learning to predict moments of negative experience in videoconferencing. We sampled thousands of short clips from the RoomReader corpus, extracting audio embeddings, facial actions, and body motion features to train models for identifying low conversational fluidity, low enjoyment, and classifying conversational events (backchanneling, interruption, or gap). Our best models achieved an ROC-AUC of up to 0.87 on hold-out videoconference sessions, with domain-general audio features proving most critical. This work demonstrates that multimodal audio-video signals can effectively predict high-level subjective conversational outcomes. In addition, this is a contribution to research on videoconferencing user experience by showing that multimodal machine learning can be used to identify rare moments of negative user experience for further study or mitigation.

Title: Adaptive Local Neighborhood-based Neural Networks for MR Image Reconstruction from Undersampled Data
Authors: Shijun Liang, Anish Lahiri, Saiprasad Ravishankar
Abstract: Recent medical image reconstruction techniques focus on generating high-quality medical images suitable for clinical use at the lowest possible cost and with the fewest possible adverse effects on patients. Recent works have shown significant promise for reconstructing MR images from sparsely sampled k-space data using deep learning. In this work, we propose a technique that rapidly estimates deep neural networks directly at reconstruction time by fitting them on small adaptively estimated neighborhoods of a training set. In brief, our algorithm alternates between searching for neighbors in a data set that are similar to the test reconstruction, and training a local network on these neighbors followed by updating the test reconstruction. Because our reconstruction model is learned on a dataset that is in some sense similar to the image being reconstructed rather than being fit on a large, diverse training set, it is more adaptive to new scans. It can also handle changes in training sets and flexible scan settings, while being relatively fast. Our approach, dubbed LONDN-MRI, was validated on multiple data sets using deep unrolled reconstruction networks. Reconstructions were performed at four fold and eight fold undersampling of k-space with 1D variable-density random phase-encode undersampling masks. Our results demonstrate that our proposed locally-trained method produces higher-quality reconstructions compared to models trained globally on larger datasets as well as other scan-adaptive methods.

Title: Evolution of flexible industrial assembly
Authors: Ali Ahmad Malik
Abstract: Assembly is a key industrial process to achieve finished goods. Driven by market demographics and technological advancements, industrial assembly has evolved through several phases i.e. craftmanship, bench assembly, assembly lines and flexible assembly cells. Due to the complexity and variety of assembly tasks, besides significant advancement of automation technologies in other manufacturing activities, humans are still considered vital for assembly operations. The rationalization of manufacturing automation has considerably remained away from assembly systems. The advancement in assembly has only been in terms of better scheduling of work tasks and avoiding of wastes. With smart manufacturing technologies such as collaborative robots, additive manufacturing, and digital twins, the opportunities have arisen for the next reshaping of assembly systems. The new paradigm promises a higher degree of automation yet remaining flexible. This may result into a new manufacturing paradigm driven by the advancement of new technologies, new customer expectations and by establishing new kinds of manufacturing systems. This study explores the future collaborative assembly cells, presents a generic framework to develop them and the basic building blocks.

Title: Beyond Traditional Beamforming: Singular Vector Projection for MU-MIMO
Authors: Md Saheed Ullah, Rafid Umayer Murshed, Mohammad Saquib, Md. Forkan Uddin
Abstract: This letter introduces a low-complexity beamforming approach for MU-MIMO systems with multiple data streams per user, minimizing inter-user interference and improving spectral efficiency (SE). The Interference-Optimized Singular Vector Beamforming (IOSVB) algorithm is developed by correlating inter-user interference with channel singular vectors. It blends interference minimization and SE maximization by identifying ideal singular vectors. Extensive simulations demonstrate that IOSVB provides near-optimal SE performance, closely matching exhaustive search results while reducing the computational overhead. This novel approach in MU-MIMO systems is a promising option for future 6G wireless communication networks due to its excellent performance and reduced complexity.

Title: FLLIC: Functionally Lossless Image Compression
Authors: Xi Zhang, Xiaolin Wu
Abstract: Recently, DNN models for lossless image coding have surpassed their traditional counterparts in compression performance, reducing the previous lossless bit rate by about ten percent for natural color images. But even with these advances, mathematically lossless image compression (MLLIC) ratios for natural images still fall short of the bandwidth and cost-effectiveness requirements of most practical imaging and vision systems at present and beyond. To overcome the performance barrier of MLLIC, we question the very necessity of MLLIC. Considering that all digital imaging sensors suffer from acquisition noises, why should we insist on mathematically lossless coding, i.e., wasting bits to preserve noises? Instead, we propose a new paradigm of joint denoising and compression called functionally lossless image compression (FLLIC), which performs lossless compression of optimally denoised images (the optimality may be task-specific). Although not literally lossless with respect to the noisy input, FLLIC aims to achieve the best possible reconstruction of the latent noise-free original image. Extensive experiments show that FLLIC achieves state-of-the-art performance in joint denoising and compression of noisy images and does so at a lower computational cost.

Abstract: This paper presents a nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode-based adaptive smooth control methodology for a distributed space telescope demonstration mission. The distributed space telescope has a flexible focal length that corresponds to the relative position in the formation flying concept. The limited specification of a CubeSat generally restricts the performance of actuators, most critically the degrees of freedom of controlled motion. This investigation leads to the development of an adaptive smooth control methodology via nonsingular fast terminal sliding modes. The adaptive smooth control algorithm that was developed for a single-input single-output system is adopted and extended to the relative orbit and attitude control systems of the distributed space telescope. The software simulation is conducted under a real mission, which means the real CubeSat structures, hardware specifications, and operational constraints. The proposed algorithm possesses only seven parameters that can be easily adjusted considering their physical meanings. Furthermore, the pre-designated error bounds are analytically derived, which enhances the applicability of the algorithm to real missions. The simulation compares the efficiency of the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode controller with the linear quadratic regulator and proportional derivative algorithms. The results verify that the adaptive smooth nonsingular fast terminal sliding mode control algorithm shows better control performance in the perspective of the alignment time and the fuel consumption for the distributed space telescope demonstration mission.

Title: Inverse Optimal Control for Linear Quadratic Tracking with Unknown Target States
Authors: Yao Li, Chengpu Yu, Hao Fang, Jie Chen
Abstract: This paper addresses the inverse optimal control for the linear quadratic tracking problem with a fixed but unknown target state, which aims to estimate the possible triplets comprising the target state, the state weight matrix, and the input weight matrix from observed optimal control input and the corresponding state trajectories. Sufficient conditions have been provided for the unique determination of both the linear quadratic cost function as well as the target state. A computationally efficient and numerically reliable parameter identification algorithm is proposed by equating optimal control strategies with a system of linear equations, and the associated relative error upper bound is derived in terms of data volume and signal-to-noise ratio. Moreover, the proposed inverse optimal control algorithm is applied for the joint cluster coordination and intent identification of a multi-agent system. By incorporating the structural constraint of the Laplace matrix, the relative error upper bound can be reduced accordingly. Finally, the algorithm's efficiency and accuracy are validated by a vehicle-on-a-lever example and a multi-agent formation control example.

Title: Array Synthesis in Terms of Characteristic Modes and Generalized Scattering Matrices
Authors: Leonardo Mörlein, Dirk Manteuffel
Abstract: The synthesis of antenna arrays in presence of mutual coupling using generalized scattering matrices in terms of characteristic modes is proposed. For the synthesis, the array is built of synthetic elements that are described by their modal scattering and radiation behavior. In particular, the question of how to describe the degrees of freedom of such elements is addressed. The eigenvalues of the characteristic modes of the element geometry and the modal radiation behavior of the antenna are thereby selected as degrees of freedom for the model of the synthetic elements. Using this model and a modal coupling matrix, an approach to optimize the modal configuration of the elements within an array is proposed. Finally, a close to reality example shows how the proposed theory can be used to enhance the cross-polarization rejection of a circularly polarized patch antenna array with a fixed beam.

Title: Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generation of Image Sequence and Application in MRI
Authors: Guanxiong Luo, Shoujin Huang, Martin Uecker
Abstract: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements, which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space). These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times, resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In MRI applications, the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations, due to the learned inter-image dependencies. The project code is available at this https URL.

Authors: Malitha Gunawardhana, Anuradha Kulathilaka, Jichao Zhao
Abstract: Atrial fibrillation (AFib) is the prominent cardiac arrhythmia in the world. It affects mostly the elderly population, with potential consequences such as stroke and heart failure in the absence of necessary treatments as soon as possible. The importance of atrial scarring in the development and progression of AFib has gained recognition, positioning late gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance imaging (LGE-MRI) as a crucial technique for the non-invasive evaluation of atrial scar tissue. This review delves into the recent progress in segmenting atrial scars using LGE-MRIs, emphasizing the importance of precise scar measurement in the treatment and management of AFib. Initially, it provides a detailed examination of AFib. Subsequently, it explores the application of deep learning in this domain. The review culminates in a discussion of the latest research advancements in atrial scar segmentation using deep learning methods. By offering a thorough analysis of current technologies and their impact on AFib management strategies, this review highlights the integral role of deep learning in enhancing atrial scar segmentation and its implications for future therapeutic approaches.

Title: Restore-RWKV: Efficient and Effective Medical Image Restoration with RWKV
Authors: Zhiwen Yang, Jiayin Li, Hui Zhang, Dan Zhao, Bingzheng Wei, Yan Xu
Abstract: Transformers have revolutionized medical image restoration, but the quadratic complexity still poses limitations for their application to high-resolution medical images. The recent advent of the Receptance Weighted Key Value (RWKV) model in the natural language processing field has attracted much attention due to its ability to process long sequences efficiently. To leverage its advanced design, we propose Restore-RWKV, the first RWKV-based model for medical image restoration. Since the original RWKV model is designed for 1D sequences, we make two necessary modifications for modeling spatial relations in 2D medical images. First, we present a recurrent WKV (Re-WKV) attention mechanism that captures global dependencies with linear computational complexity. Re-WKV incorporates bidirectional attention as basic for a global receptive field and recurrent attention to effectively model 2D dependencies from various scan directions. Second, we develop an omnidirectional token shift (Omni-Shift) layer that enhances local dependencies by shifting tokens from all directions and across a wide context range. These adaptations make the proposed Restore-RWKV an efficient and effective model for medical image restoration. Even a lightweight variant of Restore-RWKV, with only 1.16 million parameters, achieves comparable or even superior results compared to existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods. Extensive experiments demonstrate that the resulting Restore-RWKV achieves SOTA performance across a range of medical image restoration tasks, including PET image synthesis, CT image denoising, MRI image super-resolution, and all-in-one medical image restoration.

Title: Channel Estimation for Movable-Antenna MIMO Systems Via Tensor Decomposition
Authors: Ruoyu Zhang, Lei Cheng, Wei Zhang, Xinrong Guan, Yueming Cai, Wen Wu, Rui Zhang
Abstract: In this letter, we investigate the channel estimation problem for MIMO wireless communication systems with movable antennas (MAs) at both the transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx). To achieve high channel estimation accuracy with low pilot training overhead, we propose a tensor decomposition-based method for estimating the parameters of multi-path channel components, including their azimuth and elevation angles, as well as complex gain coefficients, thereby reconstructing the wireless channel between any pair of Tx and Rx MA positions in the Tx and Rx regions. First, we introduce a two-stage Tx-Rx successive antenna movement pattern for pilot training, such that the received pilot signals in both stages can be expressed as a third-order tensor. Then, we obtain the factor matrices of the tensor via the canonical polyadic decomposition, and thereby estimate the angle/gain parameters for enabling the channel reconstruction between arbitrary Tx/Rx MA positions. In addition, we analyze the uniqueness condition of the tensor decomposition, which ensures the complete channel reconstruction between the whole Tx and Rx regions based on the channel measurements at only a finite number of Tx/Rx MA positions. Finally, simulation results are presented to evaluate the proposed tensor decomposition-based method as compared to existing methods, in terms of channel estimation accuracy and pilot overhead.

Title: Distillation Learning Guided by Image Reconstruction for One-Shot Medical Image Segmentation
Authors: Feng Zhou, Yanjie Zhou, Longjie Wang, Yun Peng, David E. Carlson, Liyun Tu
Abstract: Traditional one-shot medical image segmentation (MIS) methods use registration networks to propagate labels from a reference atlas or rely on comprehensive sampling strategies to generate synthetic labeled data for training. However, these methods often struggle with registration errors and low-quality synthetic images, leading to poor performance and generalization. To overcome this, we introduce a novel one-shot MIS framework based on knowledge distillation, which allows the network to directly 'see' real images through a distillation process guided by image reconstruction. It focuses on anatomical structures in a single labeled image and a few unlabeled ones. A registration-based data augmentation network creates realistic, labeled samples, while a feature distillation module helps the student network learn segmentation from these samples, guided by the teacher network. During inference, the streamlined student network accurately segments new images. Evaluations on three public datasets (OASIS for T1 brain MRI, BCV for abdomen CT, and VerSe for vertebrae CT) show superior segmentation performance and generalization across different medical image datasets and modalities compared to leading methods.

Title: Robust Backstepping Control of a Quadrotor Unmanned Aerial Vehicle Under Colored Noises
Authors: Mehmet Karahan
Abstract: Advances in software and hardware technologies have facilitated the production of quadrotor unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nowadays, people actively use quadrotor UAVs in essential missions such as search and rescue, counter-terrorism, firefighting, surveillance, and cargo transportation. While performing these tasks, quadrotors must operate in noisy environments. Therefore, a robust controller design that can control the altitude and attitude of the quadrotor in noisy environments is of great importance. Many researchers have focused only on white Gaussian noise in their studies, whereas researchers need to consider the effects of all colored noises during the operation of the quadrotor. This study aims to design a robust controller that is resistant to all colored noises. Firstly, a nonlinear quadrotor model was created with this http URL, a backstepping controller resistant to colored noises was designed. The designed backstepping controller was tested under Gaussian white, pink, brown, blue, and purple noises. PID and Lyapunov-based controller designs were also carried out, and their time responses (rise time, overshoot, settling time) were compared with those of the backstepping controller. In the simulations, time was in seconds, altitude was in meters, and roll, pitch, and yaw references were in radians. Rise and settling time values were in seconds, and overshoot value was in percent. When the obtained values are examined, simulations prove that the proposed backstepping controller has the least overshoot and the shortest settling time under all noise types.

Title: TC-KANRecon: High-Quality and Accelerated MRI Reconstruction via Adaptive KAN Mechanisms and Intelligent Feature Scaling
Authors: Ruiquan Ge, Xiao Yu, Yifei Chen, Guanyu Zhou, Fan Jia, Shenghao Zhu, Junhao Jia, Chenyan Zhang, Yifei Sun, Dong Zeng, Changmiao Wang, Qiegen Liu, Shanzhou Niu
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) has become essential in clinical diagnosis due to its high resolution and multiple contrast mechanisms. However, the relatively long acquisition time limits its broader application. To address this issue, this study presents an innovative conditional guided diffusion model, named as TC-KANRecon, which incorporates the Multi-Free U-KAN (MF-UKAN) module and a dynamic clipping strategy. TC-KANRecon model aims to accelerate the MRI reconstruction process through deep learning methods while maintaining the quality of the reconstructed images. The MF-UKAN module can effectively balance the tradeoff between image denoising and structure preservation. Specifically, it presents the multi-head attention mechanisms and scalar modulation factors, which significantly enhances the model's robustness and structure preservation capabilities in complex noise environments. Moreover, the dynamic clipping strategy in TC-KANRecon adjusts the cropping interval according to the sampling steps, thereby mitigating image detail loss typicalching the visual features of the images. Furthermore, the MC-Model incorporates full-sampling k-space information, realizing efficient fusion of conditional information, enhancing the model's ability to process complex data, and improving the realism and detail richness of reconstructed images. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms other MRI reconstruction methods in both qualitative and quantitative evaluations. Notably, TC-KANRecon method exhibits excellent reconstruction results when processing high-noise, low-sampling-rate MRI data. Our source code is available at this https URL.

Authors: Malitha Gunawardhana, Fangqiang Xu, Jichao Zhao
Abstract: Cardiac segmentation is a critical task in medical imaging, essential for detailed analysis of heart structures, which is crucial for diagnosing and treating various cardiovascular diseases. With the advent of deep learning, automated segmentation techniques have demonstrated remarkable progress, achieving high accuracy and efficiency compared to traditional manual methods. Among these techniques, the nnU-Net framework stands out as a robust and versatile tool for medical image segmentation. In this study, we evaluate the performance of nnU-Net in segmenting cardiac magnetic resonance images (MRIs). Utilizing five cardiac segmentation datasets, we employ various nnU-Net configurations, including 2D, 3D full resolution, 3D low resolution, 3D cascade, and ensemble models. Our study benchmarks the capabilities of these configurations and examines the necessity of developing new models for specific cardiac segmentation tasks.

Title: Near-Field Signal Processing: Unleashing the Power of Proximity
Authors: Ahmet M. Elbir, Özlem Tuğfe Demir, Kumar Vijay Mishra, Symeon Chatzinotas, Martin Haardt
Abstract: After nearly a century of specialized applications in optics, remote sensing, and acoustics, the near-field (NF) electromagnetic propagation zone is experiencing a resurgence in research interest. This renewed attention is fueled by the emergence of promising applications in various fields such as wireless communications, holography, medical imaging, and quantum-inspired systems. Signal processing within NF sensing and wireless communications environments entails addressing issues related to extended scatterers, range-dependent beampatterns, spherical wavefronts, mutual coupling effects, and the presence of both reactive and radiative fields. Recent investigations have focused on these aspects in the context of extremely large arrays and wide bandwidths, giving rise to novel challenges in channel estimation, beamforming, beam training, sensing, and localization. While NF optics has a longstanding history, advancements in NF phase retrieval techniques and their applications have lately garnered significant research attention. Similarly, utilizing NF localization with acoustic arrays represents a contemporary extension of established principles in NF acoustic array signal processing. This article aims to provide an overview of state-of-the-art signal processing techniques within the NF domain, offering a comprehensive perspective on recent advances in diverse applications.

Title: A Homogeneous Graph Neural Network for Precoding and Power Allocation in Scalable Wireless Networks
Authors: Mingjun Sun, Shaochuan Wu, Haojie Wang, Yuanwei Liu, Guoyu Li, Tong Zhang
Abstract: Deep learning is widely used in wireless communications but struggles with fixed neural network sizes, which limit their adaptability in environments where the number of users and antennas varies. To overcome this, this paper introduced a generalization strategy for precoding and power allocation in scalable wireless networks. Initially, we employ an innovative approach to abstract the wireless network into a homogeneous graph. This primarily focuses on bypassing the heterogeneous features between transmitter (TX) and user entities to construct a virtual homogeneous graph serving optimization objectives, thereby enabling all nodes in the virtual graph to share the same neural network. This ``TX entity'' is known as a base station (BS) in cellular networks and an access point (AP) in cell-free networks. Subsequently, we design a universal graph neural network, termed the information carrying graph neural network (ICGNN), to capture and integrate information from this graph, maintaining permutation invariance. Lastly, using ICGNN as the core algorithm, we tailor the neural network's input and output for specific problem requirements and validate its performance in two scenarios: 1) in cellular networks, we develop a matrix-inverse-free multi-user multi-input multi-output (MU-MIMO) precoding scheme using the conjugate gradient (CG) method, adaptable to varying user and antenna numbers; 2) in a cell-free network, facing dynamic variations in the number of users served by APs, the number of APs serving each user, and the number of antennas per AP, we propose a universal power allocation scheme. Simulations demonstrate that the proposed approach not only significantly reduces computational complexity but also achieves, and potentially exceeds, the spectral efficiency (SE) of conventional algorithms.

Title: DDEvENet: Evidence-based Ensemble Learning for Uncertainty-aware Brain Parcellation Using Diffusion MRI
Authors: Chenjun Li, Dian Yang, Shun Yao, Shuyue Wang, Ye Wu, Le Zhang, Qiannuo Li, Kang Ik Kevin Cho, Johanna Seitz-Holland, Lipeng Ning, Jon Haitz Legarreta, Yogesh Rathi, Carl-Fredrik Westin, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Nir A. Sochen, Ofer Pasternak, Fan Zhang
Abstract: In this study, we developed an Evidence-based Ensemble Neural Network, namely EVENet, for anatomical brain parcellation using diffusion MRI. The key innovation of EVENet is the design of an evidential deep learning framework to quantify predictive uncertainty at each voxel during a single inference. To do so, we design an evidence-based ensemble learning framework for uncertainty-aware parcellation to leverage the multiple dMRI parameters derived from diffusion MRI. Using EVENet, we obtained accurate parcellation and uncertainty estimates across different datasets from healthy and clinical populations and with different imaging acquisitions. The overall network includes five parallel subnetworks, where each is dedicated to learning the FreeSurfer parcellation for a certain diffusion MRI parameter. An evidence-based ensemble methodology is then proposed to fuse the individual outputs. We perform experimental evaluations on large-scale datasets from multiple imaging sources, including high-quality diffusion MRI data from healthy adults and clinically diffusion MRI data from participants with various brain diseases (schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder, Parkinson's disease, cerebral small vessel disease, and neurosurgical patients with brain tumors). Compared to several state-of-the-art methods, our experimental results demonstrate highly improved parcellation accuracy across the multiple testing datasets despite the differences in dMRI acquisition protocols and health conditions. Furthermore, thanks to the uncertainty estimation, our EVENet approach demonstrates a good ability to detect abnormal brain regions in patients with lesions, enhancing the interpretability and reliability of the segmentation results.

Title: LlamaPartialSpoof: An LLM-Driven Fake Speech Dataset Simulating Disinformation Generation
Authors: Hieu-Thi Luong, Haoyang Li, Lin Zhang, Kong Aik Lee, Eng Siong Chng
Abstract: Previous fake speech datasets were constructed from a defender's perspective to develop countermeasure (CM) systems without considering diverse motivations of attackers. To better align with real-life scenarios, we created LlamaPartialSpoof, a 130-hour dataset that contains both fully and partially fake speech, using a large language model (LLM) and voice cloning technologies to evaluate the robustness of CMs. By examining valuable information for both attackers and defenders, we identify several key vulnerabilities in current CM systems, which can be exploited to enhance attack success rates, including biases toward certain text-to-speech models or concatenation methods. Our experimental results indicate that the current fake speech detection system struggle to generalize to unseen scenarios, achieving a best performance of 24.49% equal error rate.

Title: Denoising Variational Autoencoder as a Feature Reduction Pipeline for the Diagnosis of Autism based on Resting-state fMRI
Authors: Xinyuan Zheng, Orren Ravid, Robert A.J. Barry, Yoojean Kim, Qian Wang, Young-geun Kim, Xi Zhu, Xiaofu He
Abstract: Autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) are developmental conditions characterized by restricted interests and difficulties in communication. The complexity of ASD has resulted in a deficiency of objective diagnostic biomarkers. Deep learning methods have gained recognition for addressing these challenges in neuroimaging analysis, but finding and interpreting such diagnostic biomarkers are still challenging computationally. Here, we propose a feature reduction pipeline using resting-state fMRI data. We used Craddock atlas and Power atlas to extract functional connectivity data from rs-fMRI, resulting in over 30 thousand features. By using a denoising variational autoencoder, our proposed pipeline further compresses the connectivity features into 5 latent Gaussian distributions, providing is a low-dimensional representation of the data to promote computational efficiency and interpretability. To test the method, we employed the extracted latent representations to classify ASD using traditional classifiers such as SVM on a large multi-site dataset. The 95% confidence interval for the prediction accuracy of SVM is [0.63, 0.76] after site harmonization using the extracted latent distributions. Without using DVAE for dimensionality reduction, the prediction accuracy is 0.70, which falls within the interval. The DVAE successfully encoded the diagnostic information from rs-fMRI data without sacrificing prediction performance. The runtime for training the DVAE and obtaining classification results from its extracted latent features was 7 times shorter compared to training classifiers directly on the raw data. Our findings suggest that the Power atlas provides more effective brain connectivity insights for diagnosing ASD than Craddock atlas. Additionally, we visualized the latent representations to gain insights into the brain networks contributing to the differences between ASD and neurotypical brains.

Title: Sequential drone routing for data assimilation on a 2D airborne contaminant dispersion problem
Authors: Daniele Giovanni Gioia, Jacopo Bonari, Daniel Lichte, Alexander Popp
Abstract: The combined use of data from different sources can be critical in emergencies, where accurate models are needed to make real-time decisions, but high-fidelity representations and detailed information are simply unavailable. This study presents a data assimilation framework based on an ensemble Kalman filter that sequentially exploits and improves an advection-diffusion model in a case study concerning an airborne contaminant dispersion problem over a complex two-dimensional domain. An autonomous aerial drone is used to sequentially observe the actual contaminant concentration in a small fraction of the domain, orders of magnitude smaller than the total domain area. Such observations are synchronized with the data assimilation framework, iteratively adjusting the simulation. The path of the drone is sequentially optimized by balancing exploration and exploitation according to the available knowledge at each decision time. Starting from an erroneous initial model based on approximated assumptions that represent the limited initial knowledge available during emergency scenarios, results show how the proposed framework sequentially improves its belief about the dispersion dynamics, thus providing a reliable contaminant concentration map.

Authors: Naren Sengodan
Abstract: Breast cancer histopathology image classification is critical for early detection and improved patient outcomes. 1 This study introduces a novel approach leveraging EfficientNetV2 models, to improve feature extraction and focus on relevant tissue regions. The proposed models were evaluated on the BreakHis dataset across multiple magnification scales (40X, 100X, 200X, and 400X). 2 Among them, the EfficientNetV2-XL with CBAM achieved outstanding performance, reaching a peak accuracy of 98.96 percent and an F1-score of 98.31 percent at 400X magnification, outperforming state-of-the-art methods. 3 By integrating Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization (CLAHE) for preprocessing and optimizing computational efficiency, this method demonstrates its suitability for real-time clinical deployment. 3 The results underscore the potential of attention-enhanced scalable architectures in advancing diagnostic precision for breast cancer detection.

Title: Modulating State Space Model with SlowFast Framework for Compute-Efficient Ultra Low-Latency Speech Enhancement
Authors: Longbiao Cheng, Ashutosh Pandey, Buye Xu, Tobi Delbruck, Vamsi Krishna Ithapu, Shih-Chii Liu
Abstract: Deep learning-based speech enhancement (SE) methods often face significant computational challenges when needing to meet low-latency requirements because of the increased number of frames to be processed. This paper introduces the SlowFast framework which aims to reduce computation costs specifically when low-latency enhancement is needed. The framework consists of a slow branch that analyzes the acoustic environment at a low frame rate, and a fast branch that performs SE in the time domain at the needed higher frame rate to match the required latency. Specifically, the fast branch employs a state space model where its state transition process is dynamically modulated by the slow branch. Experiments on a SE task with a 2 ms algorithmic latency requirement using the Voice Bank + Demand dataset show that our approach reduces computation cost by 70% compared to a baseline single-branch network with equivalent parameters, without compromising enhancement performance. Furthermore, by leveraging the SlowFast framework, we implemented a network that achieves an algorithmic latency of just 62.5 {\mu}s (one sample point at 16 kHz sample rate) with a computation cost of 100 M MACs/s, while scoring a PESQ-NB of 3.12 and SISNR of 16.62.

Title: A Novel Automatic Real-time Motion Tracking Method for Magnetic Resonance Imaging-guided Radiotherapy: Leveraging the Enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection Framework with Automatic Segmentation
Authors: Shengqi Chen, Zilin Wang, Jianrong Dai, Shirui Qin, Ying Cao, Ruiao Zhao, Jiayun Chen, Guohua Wu, Yuan Tang
Abstract: Background and Purpose: Accurate motion tracking in MRI-guided Radiotherapy (MRIgRT) is essential for effective treatment delivery. This study aimed to enhance motion tracking precision in MRIgRT through an automatic real-time markerless tracking method using an enhanced Tracking-Learning-Detection (ETLD) framework with automatic segmentation. Materials and Methods: We developed a novel MRIgRT motion tracking and segmentation method by integrating the ETLD framework with an improved Chan-Vese model (ICV), named ETLD+ICV. The ETLD framework was upgraded for real-time cine MRI, including advanced image preprocessing, no-reference image quality assessment, an enhanced median-flow tracker, and a refined detector with dynamic search region adjustments. ICV was used for precise target volume coverage, refining the segmented region frame by frame using tracking results, with key parameters optimized. The method was tested on 3.5D MRI scans from 10 patients with liver metastases. Results: Evaluation of 106,000 frames across 77 treatment fractions showed sub-millimeter tracking errors of less than 0.8mm, with over 99% precision and 98% recall for all subjects in the Beam Eye View(BEV)/Beam Path View(BPV) orientation. The ETLD+ICV method achieved a dice global score of more than 82% for all subjects, demonstrating the method's extensibility and precise target volume coverage. Conclusion: This study successfully developed an automatic real-time markerless motion tracking method for MRIgRT that significantly outperforms current methods. The novel method not only delivers exceptional precision in tracking and segmentation but also shows enhanced adaptability to clinical demands, making it an indispensable asset in improving the efficacy of radiotherapy treatments.

Title: Sensing and Mitigation of Multi-Scatterer Self-Interference for Full-Duplex MIMO Communications
Authors: Anil Kurt, Gokhan M. Guvensen
Abstract: This paper proposes the joint use of digital self-interference cancellation (DSIC) and spatial suppression to mitigate far-field self-interference (SI) in full-duplex multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. Far-field SI, caused by echoes from environmental scatterers, is modeled based on the scatterers' angle and delay parameters, stored in a scatterer map. For each scatterer, the most suitable action regarding communication is selected from transmit beamforming, receive beamforming, DSIC, and no-action. This selection is based on simple metrics that show the expected uplink and downlink communication performance. In addition, emerging scatterers that deteriorate the communication are detected, and their delay and angles are acquired, providing an up-to-date scatterer map and presenting a \emph{sensing for communication} case. The proposed selection policy is compared with the individual implementations of DSIC and spatial suppression, highlighting the failure cases for each. It is shown that the proposed policy stays unaffected in these problematic cases and achieves SI-free performance.

Title: Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions for Open-Loop and Closed-Loop Reset Control with Application to Mechatronics Systems
Authors: Xinxin Zhang, S. Hassan HosseinNia
Abstract: Reset control enhances the performance of high-precision mechatronics systems. This paper introduces a generalized reset feedback control structure that integrates a single reset-state reset controller, a shaping filter for tuning reset actions, and linear compensators arranged in series and parallel configurations with the reset controller. This structure offers greater tuning flexibility to optimize reset control performance. However, frequency-domain analysis for such systems remains underdeveloped. To address this gap, this study makes three key contributions: (1) developing Higher-Order Sinusoidal Input Describing Functions (HOSIDFs) for open-loop reset control systems; (2) deriving HOSIDFs for closed-loop reset control systems and establishing a connection with open-loop analysis; and (3) creating a MATLAB-based App to implement these methods, providing mechatronics engineers with a practical tool for reset control system design and analysis. The accuracy of the proposed methods is validated through simulations and experiments. Finally, the utility of the proposed methods is demonstrated through case studies that analyze and compare the performance of three controllers: a PID controller, a reset controller, and a shaped reset controller on a precision motion stage. Both analytical and experimental results demonstrate that the shaped reset controller provides higher tracking precision while reducing actuation forces, outperforming both the reset and PID controllers. These findings highlight the effectiveness of the proposed frequency-domain methods in analyzing and optimizing the performance of reset-controlled mechatronics systems.

Title: Integrated Learning and Optimization for Congestion Management and Profit Maximization in Real-Time Electricity Market
Authors: Imran Pervez, Ricardo Pinto Lima, Omar Knio
Abstract: We develop novel integrated learning and optimization (ILO) methodologies to solve economic dispatch (ED) and DC optimal power flow (DCOPF) problems for better economic operation. The optimization problem for ED is formulated with load being an unknown parameter while DCOPF consists of load and power transfer distribution factor (PTDF) matrix as unknown parameters. PTDF represents the incremental variations of real power on transmission lines which occur due to real power transfers between two regions. These values represent a linearized approximation of power flows over the transmission lines. We develop novel ILO formulations to solve post-hoc penalties in electricity market and line congestion problems using ED and DCOPF optimization formulations. Our proposed methodologies capture the real-time electricity market and line congestion behavior to train the regret function which eventually train unknown loads at different buses and line PTDF matrix to achieve the afore-mentioned post-hoc goals. The proposed methodology is compared to sequential learning and optimization (SLO) which train load and PTDF forecasts for accuracy rather than economic operation. Our experimentation prove the superiority of ILO in minimizing the post-hoc penalties in electricity markets and minimizing the line congestion thereby improving the economic operation with noticeable amount.

Title: AutoGAN-Distiller: Searching to Compress Generative Adversarial Networks
Authors: Yonggan Fu, Wuyang Chen, Haotao Wang, Haoran Li, Yingyan Celine Lin, Zhangyang Wang
Abstract: The compression of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) has lately drawn attention, due to the increasing demand for deploying GANs into mobile devices for numerous applications such as image translation, enhancement and editing. However, compared to the substantial efforts to compressing other deep models, the research on compressing GANs (usually the generators) remains at its infancy stage. Existing GAN compression algorithms are limited to handling specific GAN architectures and losses. Inspired by the recent success of AutoML in deep compression, we introduce AutoML to GAN compression and develop an AutoGAN-Distiller (AGD) framework. Starting with a specifically designed efficient search space, AGD performs an end-to-end discovery for new efficient generators, given the target computational resource constraints. The search is guided by the original GAN model via knowledge distillation, therefore fulfilling the compression. AGD is fully automatic, standalone (i.e., needing no trained discriminators), and generically applicable to various GAN models. We evaluate AGD in two representative GAN tasks: image translation and super resolution. Without bells and whistles, AGD yields remarkably lightweight yet more competitive compressed models, that largely outperform existing alternatives. Our codes and pretrained models are available at this https URL.

Title: Losses Can Be Blessings: Routing Self-Supervised Speech Representations Towards Efficient Multilingual and Multitask Speech Processing
Authors: Yonggan Fu, Yang Zhang, Kaizhi Qian, Zhifan Ye, Zhongzhi Yu, Cheng-I Lai, Yingyan Celine Lin
Abstract: Self-supervised learning (SSL) for rich speech representations has achieved empirical success in low-resource Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) and other speech processing tasks, which can mitigate the necessity of a large amount of transcribed speech and thus has driven a growing demand for on-device ASR and other speech processing. However, advanced speech SSL models have become increasingly large, which contradicts the limited on-device resources. This gap could be more severe in multilingual/multitask scenarios requiring simultaneously recognizing multiple languages or executing multiple speech processing tasks. Additionally, strongly overparameterized speech SSL models tend to suffer from overfitting when being finetuned on low-resource speech corpus. This work aims to enhance the practical usage of speech SSL models towards a win-win in both enhanced efficiency and alleviated overfitting via our proposed S$^3$-Router framework, which for the first time discovers that simply discarding no more than 10\% of model weights via only finetuning model connections of speech SSL models can achieve better accuracy over standard weight finetuning on downstream speech processing tasks. More importantly, S$^3$-Router can serve as an all-in-one technique to enable (1) a new finetuning scheme, (2) an efficient multilingual/multitask solution, (3) a state-of-the-art ASR pruning technique, and (4) a new tool to quantitatively analyze the learned speech representation. We believe S$^3$-Router has provided a new perspective for practical deployment of speech SSL models. Our codes are available at: this https URL.

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a Vision-Audio-Language Omni-peRception pretraining model (VALOR) for multi-modal understanding and generation. Different from widely-studied vision-language pretraining models, VALOR jointly models relationships of vision, audio and language in an end-to-end manner. It contains three separate encoders for single modality representations, and a decoder for multimodal conditional text generation. We design two pretext tasks to pretrain VALOR model, including Multimodal Grouping Alignment (MGA) and Multimodal Grouping Captioning (MGC). MGA projects vision, language and audio to the same common space, building vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language alignment simultaneously. MGC learns how to generate text tokens in conditions of vision, audio or their both. To promote vision-audio-language pretraining research, we construct a large-scale high-quality tri-modality dataset named VALOR-1M, which contains 1M audiable videos with human annotated audiovisual captions. Extensive experiments show that VALOR can learn strong multimodal correlations and be generalized to various downstream tasks (e.g., retrieval, captioning and question answering), with different input modalities (e.g., vision-language, audio-language and audiovisual-language). VALOR achieves new state-of-the-art performances on series of public cross-modality benchmarks. Code and data are available at project page this https URL.

Title: Tactile-based Exploration, Mapping and Navigation with Collision-Resilient Aerial Vehicles
Authors: Karishma Patnaik, Aravind Adhith Pandian Saravanakumaran, Wenlong Zhang
Abstract: This article introduces XPLORER, a passive deformable UAV with a spring-augmented chassis and proprioceptive state awareness, designed to endure collisions and maintain smooth contact. We develop a fast-converging external force estimation algorithm for XPLORER that leverages onboard sensors and proprioceptive data for contact and collision detection. Using this force information, we propose four motion primitives, including three novel tactile-based primitives: tactile-traversal, tactile-turning, and ricocheting-to aid XPLORER in navigating unknown environments. These primitives are synthesized autonomously in real-time to enable efficient exploration and navigation by leveraging collisions and contacts. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, highlighting the potential of passive deformable UAVs for contact-rich real-world tasks such as non-destructive inspection, surveillance and mapping, and pursuit/evasion.

Title: Sequences with identical autocorrelation functions
Authors: Daniel J. Katz, Adeebur Rahman, Michael J Ward
Abstract: Aperiodic autocorrelation is an important indicator of performance of sequences used in communications, remote sensing, and scientific instrumentation. Knowing a sequence's autocorrelation function, which reports the autocorrelation at every possible translation, is equivalent to knowing the magnitude of the sequence's Fourier transform. The phase problem is the difficulty in resolving this lack of phase information. We say that two sequences are equicorrelational to mean that they have the same aperiodic autocorrelation function. Sequences used in technological applications often have restrictions on their terms: they are not arbitrary complex numbers, but come from a more restricted alphabet. For example, binary sequences involve terms equal to only $+1$ and $-1$. We investigate the necessary and sufficient conditions for two sequences to be equicorrelational, where we take their alphabet into consideration. There are trivial forms of equicorrelationality arising from modifications that predictably preserve the autocorrelation, for example, negating a binary sequence or reversing the order of its terms. By a search of binary sequences up to length $44$, we find that nontrivial equicorrelationality among binary sequences does occur, but is rare. An integer $n$ is said to be equivocal when there are binary sequences of length $n$ that are nontrivially equicorrelational; otherwise $n$ is unequivocal. For $n \leq 44$, we found that the unequivocal lengths are $1$--$8$, $10$, $11$, $13$, $14$, $19$, $22$, $23$, $26$, $29$, $37$, and $38$. We pose open questions about the finitude of unequivocal numbers and the probability of nontrivial equicorrelationality occurring among binary sequences.

Title: Meta-Learning for Resource Allocation in Uplink Multi-Active STAR-RIS-aided NOMA System
Authors: Sepideh Javadi, Armin Farhadi, Mohammad Robat Mili, Eduard Jorswieck, Naofal Al-Dhahir
Abstract: Simultaneously transmitting and reflecting reconfigurable intelligent surface (STAR-RIS) is a novel technology which enables the full-space coverage. In this letter, a multi-active STAR-RIS-aided system using non-orthogonal multiple access in an uplink transmission is considered, where the second-order reflections among multiple active STAR-RISs assist the transmission from the single-antenna users to the multi-antenna base station. Specifically, the total sum rate maximization problem is solved by jointly optimizing the active beamforming, power allocation, transmission and reflection beamforming at the active STAR-RISs, and user-active STAR-RIS assignment. To solve the non-convex optimization problem, a novel deep reinforcement learning algorithm is proposed which integrates Meta-learning and deep deterministic policy gradient (DDPG), denoted by Meta-DDPG. Numerical results reveal that our proposed Meta-DDPG algorithm outperforms the DDPG algorithm with $19\%$ improvement, while second-order reflections among multi-active STAR-RISs provide $74.1\%$ enhancement in the total data rate.

Title: Automated Security Response through Online Learning with Adaptive Conjectures
Authors: Kim Hammar, Tao Li, Rolf Stadler, Quanyan Zhu
Abstract: We study automated security response for an IT infrastructure and formulate the interaction between an attacker and a defender as a partially observed, non-stationary game. We relax the standard assumption that the game model is correctly specified and consider that each player has a probabilistic conjecture about the model, which may be misspecified in the sense that the true model has probability 0. This formulation allows us to capture uncertainty and misconception about the infrastructure and the intents of the players. To learn effective game strategies online, we design Conjectural Online Learning (COL), a novel method where a player iteratively adapts its conjecture using Bayesian learning and updates its strategy through rollout. We prove that the conjectures converge to best fits, and we provide a bound on the performance improvement that rollout enables with a conjectured model. To characterize the steady state of the game, we propose a variant of the Berk-Nash equilibrium. We present COL through an advanced persistent threat use case. Testbed evaluations show that COL produces effective security strategies that adapt to a changing environment. We also find that COL enables faster convergence than current reinforcement learning techniques.

Title: Normalizing Flow-based Differentiable Particle Filters
Authors: Xiongjie Chen, Yunpeng Li
Abstract: Recently, there has been a surge of interest in incorporating neural networks into particle filters, e.g. differentiable particle filters, to perform joint sequential state estimation and model learning for non-linear non-Gaussian state-space models in complex environments. Existing differentiable particle filters are mostly constructed with vanilla neural networks that do not allow density estimation. As a result, they are either restricted to a bootstrap particle filtering framework or employ predefined distribution families (e.g. Gaussian distributions), limiting their performance in more complex real-world scenarios. In this paper we present a differentiable particle filtering framework that uses (conditional) normalizing flows to build its dynamic model, proposal distribution, and measurement model. This not only enables valid probability densities but also allows the proposed method to adaptively learn these modules in a flexible way, without being restricted to predefined distribution families. We derive the theoretical properties of the proposed filters and evaluate the proposed normalizing flow-based differentiable particle filters' performance through a series of numerical experiments.

Title: Prompt-Singer: Controllable Singing-Voice-Synthesis with Natural Language Prompt
Authors: Yongqi Wang, Ruofan Hu, Rongjie Huang, Zhiqing Hong, Ruiqi Li, Wenrui Liu, Fuming You, Tao Jin, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Recent singing-voice-synthesis (SVS) methods have achieved remarkable audio quality and naturalness, yet they lack the capability to control the style attributes of the synthesized singing explicitly. We propose Prompt-Singer, the first SVS method that enables attribute controlling on singer gender, vocal range and volume with natural language. We adopt a model architecture based on a decoder-only transformer with a multi-scale hierarchy, and design a range-melody decoupled pitch representation that enables text-conditioned vocal range control while keeping melodic accuracy. Furthermore, we explore various experiment settings, including different types of text representations, text encoder fine-tuning, and introducing speech data to alleviate data scarcity, aiming to facilitate further research. Experiments show that our model achieves favorable controlling ability and audio quality. Audio samples are available at this http URL .

Title: Frieren: Efficient Video-to-Audio Generation Network with Rectified Flow Matching
Authors: Yongqi Wang, Wenxiang Guo, Rongjie Huang, Jiawei Huang, Zehan Wang, Fuming You, Ruiqi Li, Zhou Zhao
Abstract: Video-to-audio (V2A) generation aims to synthesize content-matching audio from silent video, and it remains challenging to build V2A models with high generation quality, efficiency, and visual-audio temporal synchrony. We propose Frieren, a V2A model based on rectified flow matching. Frieren regresses the conditional transport vector field from noise to spectrogram latent with straight paths and conducts sampling by solving ODE, outperforming autoregressive and score-based models in terms of audio quality. By employing a non-autoregressive vector field estimator based on a feed-forward transformer and channel-level cross-modal feature fusion with strong temporal alignment, our model generates audio that is highly synchronized with the input video. Furthermore, through reflow and one-step distillation with guided vector field, our model can generate decent audio in a few, or even only one sampling step. Experiments indicate that Frieren achieves state-of-the-art performance in both generation quality and temporal alignment on VGGSound, with alignment accuracy reaching 97.22%, and 6.2% improvement in inception score over the strong diffusion-based baseline.

Title: A Reference-free Metric for Language-Queried Audio Source Separation using Contrastive Language-Audio Pretraining
Authors: Feiyang Xiao, Jian Guan, Qiaoxi Zhu, Xubo Liu, Wenbo Wang, Shuhan Qi, Kejia Zhang, Jianyuan Sun, Wenwu Wang
Abstract: Language-queried audio source separation (LASS) aims to separate an audio source guided by a text query, with the signal-to-distortion ratio (SDR)-based metrics being commonly used to objectively measure the quality of the separated audio. However, the SDR-based metrics require a reference signal, which is often difficult to obtain in real-world scenarios. In addition, with the SDR-based metrics, the content information of the text query is not considered effectively in LASS. This paper introduces a reference-free evaluation metric using a contrastive language-audio pretraining (CLAP) module, termed CLAPScore, which measures the semantic similarity between the separated audio and the text query. Unlike SDR, the proposed CLAPScore metric evaluates the quality of the separated audio based on the content information of the text query, without needing a reference signal. Experiments show that the CLAPScore provides an effective evaluation of the semantic relevance of the separated audio to the text query, as compared to the SDR metric, offering an alternative for the performance evaluation of LASS systems. The code for evaluation is publicly available.

Abstract: The semiconductor industry has prioritized automating repetitive tasks through closed-loop, self-driving experimentation, accelerating the optimization of complex multi-step processes. The emergence of machine learning (ML) has ushered in self-driving processes with minimal human intervention. This work introduces SemiEpi, a self-driving platform designed to execute molecular beam epitaxy (MBE) growth of semiconductor heterostructures through multi-step processes, in-situ monitoring, and on-the-fly feedback control. By integrating standard reactor, parameter initialization, and multiple ML models, SemiEpi identifies optimal initial conditions and proposes experiments for multi-step heterostructure growth, eliminating the need for extensive expertise in MBE processes. SemiEpi initializes material growth parameters tailored to specific material characteristics, and fine-tuned control over the growth process is then achieved through ML optimization. We optimize the growth for InAs quantum dots (QDs) heterostructures to showcase the power of SemiEpi, achieving a QD density of 5E10/cm2, 1.6-fold increased photoluminescence (PL) intensity and reduced full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 29.13 meV. This work highlights the potential of closed-loop, ML-guided systems to address challenges in multi-step growth. Our method is critical to achieve repeatable materials growth using commercially scalable tools. Furthermore, our strategy facilitates developing a hardware-independent process and enhancing process repeatability and stability, even without exhaustive knowledge of growth parameters.

Title: Meta-Learning for Hybrid Precoding in Millimeter Wave MIMO System
Authors: Yifan Guo
Abstract: The hybrid analog/digital architecture that connects a limited number of RF chains to multiple antennas through phase shifters could effectively address the energy consumption issues in massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. However, the main challenges in hybrid precoding lie in the coupling between analog and digital precoders and the constant modulus constraint. Generally, traditional optimization algorithms for this problem typically suffer from high computational complexity or suboptimal performance, while deep learning based solutions exhibit poor scalability and robustness. This paper proposes a plug and play, free of pre-training solution that leverages gradient guided meta learning (GGML) framework to maximize the spectral efficiency of MIMO systems through hybrid precoding. Specifically, GGML utilizes gradient information as network input to facilitate the sharing of gradient information flow. We retain the iterative process of traditional algorithms and leverage meta learning to alternately optimize the precoder. Simulation results show that this method outperforms existing methods, demonstrates robustness to variations in system parameters, and can even exceed the performance of fully digital weighted minimum mean square error (WMMSE) precoding with the same number of antennas.

Title: DRCap: Decoding CLAP Latents with Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Zero-shot Audio Captioning
Authors: Xiquan Li, Wenxi Chen, Ziyang Ma, Xuenan Xu, Yuzhe Liang, Zhisheng Zheng, Qiuqiang Kong, Xie Chen
Abstract: While automated audio captioning (AAC) has made notable progress, traditional fully supervised AAC models still face two critical challenges: the need for expensive audio-text pair data for training and performance degradation when transferring across domains. To overcome these limitations, we present DRCap, a data-efficient and flexible zero-shot audio captioning system that requires text-only data for training and can quickly adapt to new domains without additional fine-tuning. DRCap integrates a contrastive language-audio pre-training (CLAP) model and a large-language model (LLM) as its backbone. During training, the model predicts the ground-truth caption with a fixed text encoder from CLAP, whereas, during inference, the text encoder is replaced with the audio encoder to generate captions for audio clips in a zero-shot manner. To mitigate the modality gap of the CLAP model, we use both the projection strategy from the encoder side and the retrieval-augmented generation strategy from the decoder side. Specifically, audio embeddings are first projected onto a text embedding support to absorb extensive semantic information within the joint multi-modal space of CLAP. At the same time, similar captions retrieved from a datastore are fed as prompts to instruct the LLM, incorporating external knowledge to take full advantage of its strong generative capability. Conditioned on both the projected CLAP embedding and the retrieved similar captions, the model is able to produce a more accurate and semantically rich textual description. By tailoring the text embedding support and the caption datastore to the target domain, DRCap acquires a robust ability to adapt to new domains in a training-free manner. Experimental results demonstrate that DRCap outperforms all other zero-shot models in in-domain scenarios and achieves state-of-the-art performance in cross-domain scenarios.

Title: How to Learn a New Language? An Efficient Solution for Self-Supervised Learning Models Unseen Languages Adaption in Low-Resource Scenario
Authors: Shih-Heng Wang, Zih-Ching Chen, Jiatong Shi, Ming-To Chuang, Guan-Ting Lin, Kuan-Po Huang, David Harwath, Shang-Wen Li, Hung-yi Lee
Abstract: The utilization of speech Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) models achieves impressive performance on Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR). However, in low-resource language ASR, they encounter the domain mismatch problem between pre-trained and low-resource languages. Typical solutions like fine-tuning the SSL model suffer from high computation costs while using frozen SSL models as feature extractors comes with poor performance. To handle these issues, we extend a conventional efficient fine-tuning scheme based on the adapter. We add an extra intermediate adaptation to warm up the adapter and downstream model initialization. Remarkably, we update only 1-5% of the total model parameters to achieve the adaptation. Experimental results on the ML-SUPERB dataset show that our solution outperforms conventional efficient fine-tuning. It achieves up to a 28% relative improvement in the Character/Phoneme error rate when adapting to unseen languages.

Title: AI-powered Digital Twin of the Ocean: Reliable Uncertainty Quantification for Real-time Wave Height Prediction with Deep Ensemble
Authors: Dongeon Lee, Sunwoong Yang, Jae-Won Oh, Su-Gil Cho, Sanghyuk Kim, Namwoo Kang
Abstract: Environmental pollution and fossil fuel depletion have prompted the need for renewable energy-based power generation. However, its stability is often challenged by low energy density and non-stationary conditions. Wave energy converters (WECs), in particular, need reliable real-time wave height prediction to address these issues caused by irregular wave patterns, which can lead to the inefficient and unstable operation of WECs. In this study, we propose an AI-powered reliable real-time wave height prediction model that integrates long short-term memory (LSTM) networks for temporal prediction with deep ensemble (DE) for robust uncertainty quantification (UQ), ensuring high accuracy and reliability. To further enhance the reliability, uncertainty calibration is applied, which has proven to significantly improve the quality of the quantified uncertainty. Using real operational data from an oscillating water column-wave energy converter (OWC-WEC) system in Jeju, South Korea, the model achieves notable accuracy (R2 > 0.9), while increasing uncertainty quality by over 50% through simple calibration technique. Furthermore, a comprehensive parametric study is conducted to explore the effects of key model hyperparameters, offering valuable guidelines for diverse operational scenarios, characterized by differences in wavelength, amplitude, and period. These results demonstrate the model's capability to deliver reliable predictions, facilitating digital twin of the ocean.

Title: LEDiff: Latent Exposure Diffusion for HDR Generation
Authors: Chao Wang, Zhihao Xia, Thomas Leimkuehler, Karol Myszkowski, Xuaner Zhang
Abstract: While consumer displays increasingly support more than 10 stops of dynamic range, most image assets such as internet photographs and generative AI content remain limited to 8-bit low dynamic range (LDR), constraining their utility across high dynamic range (HDR) applications. Currently, no generative model can produce high-bit, high-dynamic range content in a generalizable way. Existing LDR-to-HDR conversion methods often struggle to produce photorealistic details and physically-plausible dynamic range in the clipped areas. We introduce LEDiff, a method that enables a generative model with HDR content generation through latent space fusion inspired by image-space exposure fusion techniques. It also functions as an LDR-to-HDR converter, expanding the dynamic range of existing low-dynamic range images. Our approach uses a small HDR dataset to enable a pretrained diffusion model to recover detail and dynamic range in clipped highlights and shadows. LEDiff brings HDR capabilities to existing generative models and converts any LDR image to HDR, creating photorealistic HDR outputs for image generation, image-based lighting (HDR environment map generation), and photographic effects such as depth of field simulation, where linear HDR data is essential for realistic quality.

Abstract: With the growing demand for seamless connectivity and intelligent communication, the integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and sixth-generation (6G) communication networks has emerged as a transformative paradigm. By embedding AI capabilities across various network layers, this integration enables optimized resource allocation, improved efficiency, and enhanced system robust performance, particularly in intricate and dynamic environments. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of AI and communication for 6G networks, with a focus on emphasizing their foundational principles, inherent challenges, and future research opportunities. We first review the integration of AI and communications in the context of 6G, exploring the driving factors behind incorporating AI into wireless communications, as well as the vision for the convergence of AI and 6G. The discourse then transitions to a detailed exposition of the envisioned integration of AI within 6G networks, delineated across three progressive developmental stages. The first stage, AI for Network, focuses on employing AI to augment network performance, optimize efficiency, and enhance user service experiences. The second stage, Network for AI, highlights the role of the network in facilitating and buttressing AI operations and presents key enabling technologies, such as digital twins for AI and semantic communication. In the final stage, AI as a Service, it is anticipated that future 6G networks will innately provide AI functions as services, supporting application scenarios like immersive communication and intelligent industrial robots. In addition, we conduct an in-depth analysis of the critical challenges faced by the integration of AI and communications in 6G. Finally, we outline promising future research opportunities that are expected to drive the development and refinement of AI and 6G communications.

Title: Joint Task Offloading and Routing in Wireless Multi-hop Networks Using Biased Backpressure Algorithm
Authors: Zhongyuan Zhao, Jake Perazzone, Gunjan Verma, Kevin Chan, Ananthram Swami, Santiago Segarra
Abstract: A significant challenge for computation offloading in wireless multi-hop networks is the complex interaction among traffic flows in the presence of interference. Existing approaches often ignore these key effects and/or rely on outdated queueing and channel state information. To fill these gaps, we reformulate joint offloading and routing as a routing problem on an extended graph with physical and virtual links. We adopt the state-of-the-art shortest path-biased Backpressure routing algorithm, which allows the destination and the route of a job to be dynamically adjusted at every time step based on network-wide long-term information and real-time states of local neighborhoods. In large networks, our approach achieves smaller makespan than existing approaches, such as separated Backpressure offloading and joint offloading and routing based on linear programming.

Title: RiTTA: Modeling Event Relations in Text-to-Audio Generation
Authors: Yuhang He, Yash Jain, Xubo Liu, Andrew Markham, Vibhav Vineet
Abstract: Despite significant advancements in Text-to-Audio (TTA) generation models achieving high-fidelity audio with fine-grained context understanding, they struggle to model the relations between audio events described in the input text. However, previous TTA methods have not systematically explored audio event relation modeling, nor have they proposed frameworks to enhance this capability. In this work, we systematically study audio event relation modeling in TTA generation models. We first establish a benchmark for this task by: 1. proposing a comprehensive relation corpus covering all potential relations in real-world scenarios; 2. introducing a new audio event corpus encompassing commonly heard audios; and 3. proposing new evaluation metrics to assess audio event relation modeling from various perspectives. Furthermore, we propose a finetuning framework to enhance existing TTA models ability to model audio events relation. Code is available at: this https URL

Title: Adapting Whisper for Code-Switching through Encoding Refining and Language-Aware Decoding
Authors: Jiahui Zhao, Hao Shi, Chenrui Cui, Tianrui Wang, Hexin Liu, Zhaoheng Ni, Lingxuan Ye, Longbiao Wang
Abstract: Code-switching (CS) automatic speech recognition (ASR) faces challenges due to the language confusion resulting from accents, auditory similarity, and seamless language switches. Adaptation on the pre-trained multi-lingual model has shown promising performance for CS-ASR. In this paper, we adapt Whisper, which is a large-scale multilingual pre-trained speech recognition model, to CS from both encoder and decoder parts. First, we propose an encoder refiner to enhance the encoder's capacity of intra-sentence swithching. Second, we propose using two sets of language-aware adapters with different language prompt embeddings to achieve language-specific decoding information in each decoder layer. Then, a fusion module is added to fuse the language-aware decoding. The experimental results using the SEAME dataset show that, compared with the baseline model, the proposed approach achieves a relative MER reduction of 4.1% and 7.2% on the dev_man and dev_sge test sets, respectively, surpassing state-of-the-art methods. Through experiments, we found that the proposed method significantly improves the performance on non-native language in CS speech, indicating that our approach enables Whisper to better distinguish between the two languages.
