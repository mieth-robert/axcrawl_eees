Title: Musical Score Following using Statistical Inference
Authors: Josephine Cowley
Abstract: Musical score following is the real-time mapping of a performance to corresponding locations in a musical score. Score following can be used in a variety of applications including automatic page turning and real-time accompaniment. This report presents a novel approach for score following motivated by Wilson and Adams's 2013 paper, which introduces Spectral Mixture (SM) kernels for Gaussian Process (GP) regression. Since the SM kernel is derived from a Mixture of Gaussians in the frequency domain, it is particularly suitable for modelling the superposed power spectra of musical notes, in which energy is concentrated at multiples of the fundamental frequency of each note. Our score follower begins by using a GP to statistically infer the musical notes played during 800-sample 'audioframes' (~18 ms) of solo piano music. These predictions are then used in a duration-dependent Hidden Markov Model to predict the most likely score positions in real time. Our two-stage approach achieves successful score following not only on four-part hymns arranged for keyboard, but also on pieces for the violin, oboe, and flute. This showcases the powerful and flexible nature of GPs for statistical inference on musical audio signals. Given the success of this project, we contribute to the literature a first proof of concept of the application of GPs in score following, and more broadly, in online Music Information Retrieval (MIR) tasks. This project also contributes a working score follower product that renders score position in real time using an adapted open-source user interface. Areas for future work include improving accuracy on repeated notes and during heavy use of sustain pedal, adapting to minor deviations from the score, and modelling multi-instrument works.

Title: MoHAVE: Mixture of Hierarchical Audio-Visual Experts for Robust Speech Recognition
Authors: Sungnyun Kim, Kangwook Jang, Sangmin Bae, Sungwoo Cho, Se-Young Yun
Abstract: Audio-visual speech recognition (AVSR) has become critical for enhancing speech recognition in noisy environments by integrating both auditory and visual modalities. However, existing AVSR systems struggle to scale up without compromising computational efficiency. In this study, we introduce MoHAVE (Mixture of Hierarchical Audio-Visual Experts), a novel robust AVSR framework designed to address these scalability constraints. By leveraging a Mixture-of-Experts (MoE) architecture, MoHAVE activates modality-specific expert groups, ensuring dynamic adaptation to various audio-visual inputs with minimal computational overhead. Key contributions of MoHAVE include: (1) a sparse MoE framework that efficiently scales AVSR model capacity, (2) a hierarchical gating mechanism that dynamically utilizes the expert groups based on input context, enhancing adaptability and robustness, and (3) remarkable performance across robust AVSR benchmarks, including LRS3 and MuAViC transcription and translation tasks, setting a new standard for scalable speech recognition systems.

Title: Performance of energy harvesters with parameter mismatch
Authors: Tomasz Burzyński, Piotr Brzeski, Przemysław Perlikowski
Abstract: This study explores the impact of parameter mismatch on the stability of cross-well motion in energy harvesters, using a basin stability metric. Energy harvesters, essential for converting ambient energy into electricity, increasingly incorporate multi-well systems to enhance efficiency. However, these systems are sensitive to initial conditions and parameter variations, which can affect their ability to sustain optimal cross-well motion -- a state associated with maximum power output. Our analysis compared four harvester types under varying levels of parameter mismatch, assessing resilience of the devices to parameter variations. By identifying safe operating ranges within the excitation parameter space, this study provides practical guidance for designing robust, stable harvesters capable of maintaining cross-well motion despite parameter uncertainties. These insights contribute to advancing the reliability of energy harvesting devices in real-world applications where parameter mismatches are inevitable.

Title: Image Watermarking of Generative Diffusion Models
Authors: Yunzhuo Chen, Jordan Vice, Naveed Akhtar, Nur Al Hasan Haldar, Ajmal Mian
Abstract: Embedding watermarks into the output of generative models is essential for establishing copyright and verifiable ownership over the generated content. Emerging diffusion model watermarking methods either embed watermarks in the frequency domain or offer limited versatility of the watermark patterns in the image space, which allows simplistic detection and removal of the watermarks from the generated content. To address this issue, we propose a watermarking technique that embeds watermark features into the diffusion model itself. Our technique enables training of a paired watermark extractor for a generative model that is learned through an end-to-end process. The extractor forces the generator, during training, to effectively embed versatile, imperceptible watermarks in the generated content while simultaneously ensuring their precise recovery. We demonstrate highly accurate watermark embedding/detection and show that it is also possible to distinguish between different watermarks embedded with our method to differentiate between generative models.

Title: Lifetime Analysis of Circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G Balanced Systems in a Shock Environment
Authors: Seung Min Baik, Yongkyu Cho
Abstract: This paper examines the lifetime distributions of circular $k$-out-of-$n$: G balanced systems operating in a shock environment, providing a unified framework for both discrete- and continuous-time perspectives. The system remains functioning only if at least $k$ operating units satisfy a predefined balance condition (BC). Building on this concept, we demonstrate that the shock numbers to failure (SNTF) follow a discrete phase-type distribution by modeling the system's stochastic dynamics with a finite Markov chain and applying BC-based state space consolidation. Additionally, we develop a computationally efficient method for directly computing multi-step transition probabilities of the underlying Markov chain. Next, assuming the inter-arrival times between shocks follow a phase-type distribution, we establish that the continuous-time system lifetime, or the time to system failure (TTF), also follows a phase-type distribution with different parameters. Extensive numerical studies illustrate the impact of key parameters-such as the number of units, minimum requirement of the number of operating units, individual unit reliability, choice of balance condition, and inter-shock time distribution-on the SNTF, TTF, and their variability.

Title: Safe Multi-agent Satellite Servicing with Control Barrier Functions
Authors: Deep Parikh, David van Wijk, Manoranjan Majji
Abstract: The use of control barrier functions under uncertain pose information of multiple small servicing agents is analyzed for a satellite servicing application. The application consists of modular servicing agents deployed towards a tumbling space object from a mothership. Relative position and orientation of each agent is obtained via fusion of relative range and inertial measurement sensors. The control barrier functions are utilized to avoid collisions with other agents for the application of simultaneously relocating servicing agents on a tumbling body. A differential collision detection and avoidance framework using the polytopic hull of the tumbling space object is utilized to safely guide the agents away from the tumbling object.

Title: Enhancing Age-Related Robustness in Children Speaker Verification
Authors: Vishwas M. Shetty, Jiusi Zheng, Steven M. Lulich, Abeer Alwan
Abstract: One of the main challenges in children's speaker verification (C-SV) is the significant change in children's voices as they grow. In this paper, we propose two approaches to improve age-related robustness in C-SV. We first introduce a Feature Transform Adapter (FTA) module that integrates local patterns into higher-level global representations, reducing overfitting to specific local features and improving the inter-year SV performance of the system. We then employ Synthetic Audio Augmentation (SAA) to increase data diversity and size, thereby improving robustness against age-related changes. Since the lack of longitudinal speech datasets makes it difficult to measure age-related robustness of C-SV systems, we introduce a longitudinal dataset to assess inter-year verification robustness of C-SV systems. By integrating both of our proposed methods, the average equal error rate was reduced by 19.4%, 13.0%, and 6.1% in the one-year, two-year, and three-year gap inter-year evaluation sets, respectively, compared to the baseline.

Title: Synthesis of Dynamic Masks for Information-Theoretic Opacity in Stochastic Systems
Authors: Sumukha Udupa, Chongyang Shi, Jie Fu
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the synthesis of dynamic information releasing mechanisms, referred to as ''masks'', to minimize information leakage from a stochastic system to an external observer. Specifically, for a stochastic system, an observer aims to infer whether the final state of the system trajectory belongs to a set of secret states. The dynamic mask seeks to regulate sensor information in order to maximize the observer's uncertainty about the final state, a property known as final-state opacity. While existing supervisory control literature on dynamic masks primarily addresses qualitative opacity, we propose quantifying opacity in stochastic systems by conditional entropy, which is a measure of information leakage in information security. We then formulate a constrained optimization problem to synthesize a dynamic mask that maximizes final-state opacity under a total cost constraint on masking. To solve this constrained optimal dynamic mask synthesis problem, we develop a novel primal-dual policy gradient method. Additionally, we present a technique for computing the gradient of conditional entropy with respect to the masking policy parameters, leveraging observable operators in hidden Markov models. To demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, we apply our method to an illustrative example and a stochastic grid world scenario, showing how our algorithm optimally enforces final-state opacity under cost constraints.

Title: Can Large Language Model Agents Balance Energy Systems?
Authors: Xinxing Ren, Chun Sing Lai, Gareth Taylor, Zekun Guo
Abstract: This paper presents a hybrid approach that integrates Large Language Models (LLMs) with a multi-scenario Stochastic Unit Commitment (SUC) framework, focusing on both efficiency and reliability under high wind generation uncertainties. Numerical experiments on small-to-medium-sized test systems show that while the traditional SUC approach yields a total cost of 99.05 million USD with 3.04 GWh of load curtailment, the LLM-assisted SUC (LLM-SUC) reduces costs to 98.87 million USD and lowers load curtailment to 2.32 GWh, an improvement of nearly 24%. Both methods maintain zero wind curtailment, confirming robust renewable integration. By employing an LLM agent that helps balance the energy system more effectively, the proposed framework enhances demand fulfillment at reduced costs, illustrating the potential of AI to inform generator commitments in uncertain operating conditions. Further gains may be realized by refining prompt design, incorporating historical operational data, and extending this approach to higher-dimensional uncertainties and energy storage systems, ultimately fostering greater resilience, efficiency, and adaptability in next-generation power system operations.

Title: SAMRI-2: A Memory-based Model for Cartilage and Meniscus Segmentation in 3D MRIs of the Knee Joint
Authors: Danielle L. Ferreira, Bruno A. A. Nunes, Xuzhe Zhang, Laura Carretero Gomez, Maggie Fung, Ravi Soni
Abstract: Accurate morphometric assessment of cartilage-such as thickness/volume-via MRI is essential for monitoring knee osteoarthritis. Segmenting cartilage remains challenging and dependent on extensive expert-annotated datasets, which are heavily subjected to inter-reader variability. Recent advancements in Visual Foundational Models (VFM), especially memory-based approaches, offer opportunities for improving generalizability and robustness. This study introduces a deep learning (DL) method for cartilage and meniscus segmentation from 3D MRIs using interactive, memory-based VFMs. To improve spatial awareness and convergence, we incorporated a Hybrid Shuffling Strategy (HSS) during training and applied a segmentation mask propagation technique to enhance annotation efficiency. We trained four AI models-a CNN-based 3D-VNet, two automatic transformer-based models (SaMRI2D and SaMRI3D), and a transformer-based promptable memory-based VFM (SAMRI-2)-on 3D knee MRIs from 270 patients using public and internal datasets and evaluated on 57 external cases, including multi-radiologist annotations and different data acquisitions. Model performance was assessed against reference standards using Dice Score (DSC) and Intersection over Union (IoU), with additional morphometric evaluations to further quantify segmentation accuracy. SAMRI-2 model, trained with HSS, outperformed all other models, achieving an average DSC improvement of 5 points, with a peak improvement of 12 points for tibial cartilage. It also demonstrated the lowest cartilage thickness errors, reducing discrepancies by up to threefold. Notably, SAMRI-2 maintained high performance with as few as three user clicks per volume, reducing annotation effort while ensuring anatomical precision. This memory-based VFM with spatial awareness offers a novel approach for reliable AI-assisted knee MRI segmentation, advancing DL in musculoskeletal imaging.

Title: Accelerating Quantitative MRI using Subspace Multiscale Energy Model (SS-MuSE)
Authors: Yan Chen, Jyothi Rikhab Chand, Steven R. Kecskemeti, James H. Holmes, Mathews Jacob
Abstract: Multi-contrast MRI methods acquire multiple images with different contrast weightings, which are used for the differentiation of the tissue types or quantitative mapping. However, the scan time needed to acquire multiple contrasts is prohibitively long for 3D acquisition schemes, which can offer isotropic image resolution. While deep learning-based methods have been extensively used to accelerate 2D and 2D + time problems, the high memory demand, computation time, and need for large training data sets make them challenging for large-scale volumes. To address these challenges, we generalize the plug-and-play multi-scale energy-based model (MuSE) to a regularized subspace recovery setting, where we jointly regularize the 3D multi-contrast spatial factors in a subspace formulation. The explicit energy-based formulation allows us to use variable splitting optimization methods for computationally efficient recovery.

Title: PainDECOG: Machine Learning-Based Identification of Pain Biomarkers from sEEG Signals
Authors: Sidharth, Vishwas Sathish, Shweta Bansal, Samantha Sun, Timmy Pham, Kurt Weaver, Rajesh P. N. Rao, Jeffrey Herron
Abstract: This study presents a systematic machine-learning approach for classifying acute pain from raw electrophysiological signals. We address binary and ternary classification tasks, leveraging Power-In-Band (PIB) and signal coherence as distinguishing features. Our method evaluates the effectiveness of traditional machine learning algorithms on a manually curated electrophysiological dataset obtained from intracranial electroencephalography (iEEG), offering valuable insights into model performance for pain detection. Furthermore, we identify critical electrode pairings associated with acute pain, providing a clearer understanding of the neural markers that differentiate pain states. This work highlights the potential of targeted feature engineering in advancing pain classification, setting the stage for future enhancements in real-time and personalized pain assessment tools. Additionally, these findings have promising applications in neuromodulation and Deep Brain Stimulation (DBS), where adaptive and closed-loop systems could leverage identified pain markers to modulate pain-related brain regions more precisely, offering improved therapeutic options for chronic pain management

Title: Deep Learning for Wound Tissue Segmentation: A Comprehensive Evaluation using A Novel Dataset
Authors: Muhammad Ashad Kabir, Nidita Roy, Md. Ekramul Hossain, Jill Featherston, Sayed Ahmed
Abstract: Deep learning (DL) techniques have emerged as promising solutions for medical wound tissue segmentation. However, a notable limitation in this field is the lack of publicly available labelled datasets and a standardised performance evaluation of state-of-the-art DL models on such datasets. This study addresses this gap by comprehensively evaluating various DL models for wound tissue segmentation using a novel dataset. We have curated a dataset comprising 147 wound images exhibiting six tissue types: slough, granulation, maceration, necrosis, bone, and tendon. The dataset was meticulously labelled for semantic segmentation employing supervised machine learning techniques. Three distinct labelling formats were developed -- full image, patch, and superpixel. Our investigation encompassed a wide array of DL segmentation and classification methodologies, ranging from conventional approaches like UNet, to generative adversarial networks such as cGAN, and modified techniques like FPN+VGG16. Also, we explored DL-based classification methods (e.g., ResNet50) and machine learning-based classification leveraging DL features (e.g., AlexNet+RF). In total, 82 wound tissue segmentation models were derived across the three labelling formats. Our analysis yielded several notable findings, including identifying optimal DL models for each labelling format based on weighted average Dice or F1 scores. Notably, FPN+VGG16 emerged as the top-performing DL model for wound tissue segmentation, achieving a dice score of 82.25%. This study provides a valuable benchmark for evaluating wound image segmentation and classification models, offering insights to inform future research and clinical practice in wound care. The labelled dataset created in this study is available at this https URL.

Title: Towards Zero-Shot Task-Generalizable Learning on fMRI
Authors: Jiyao Wang, Nicha C. Dvornek, Peiyu Duan, Lawrence H. Staib, James S. Duncan
Abstract: Functional MRI measuring BOLD signal is an increasingly important imaging modality in studying brain functions and neurological disorders. It can be acquired in either a resting-state or a task-based paradigm. Compared to resting-state fMRI, task-based fMRI is acquired while the subject is performing a specific task designed to enhance study-related brain activities. Consequently, it generally has more informative task-dependent signals. However, due to the variety of task designs, it is much more difficult than in resting state to aggregate task-based fMRI acquired in different tasks to train a generalizable model. To resolve this complication, we propose a supervised task-aware network TA-GAT that jointly learns a general-purpose encoder and task-specific contextual information. The encoder-generated embedding and the learned contextual information are then combined as input to multiple modules for performing downstream tasks. We believe that the proposed task-aware architecture can plug-and-play in any neural network architecture to incorporate the prior knowledge of fMRI tasks into capturing functional brain patterns.

Title: ResiComp: Loss-Resilient Image Compression via Dual-Functional Masked Visual Token Modeling
Authors: Sixian Wang, Jincheng Dai, Xiaoqi Qin, Ke Yang, Kai Niu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: Recent advancements in neural image codecs (NICs) are of significant compression performance, but limited attention has been paid to their error resilience. These resulting NICs tend to be sensitive to packet losses, which are prevalent in real-time communications. In this paper, we investigate how to elevate the resilience ability of NICs to combat packet losses. We propose ResiComp, a pioneering neural image compression framework with feature-domain packet loss concealment (PLC). Motivated by the inherent consistency between generation and compression, we advocate merging the tasks of entropy modeling and PLC into a unified framework focused on latent space context modeling. To this end, we take inspiration from the impressive generative capabilities of large language models (LLMs), particularly the recent advances of masked visual token modeling (MVTM). During training, we integrate MVTM to mirror the effects of packet loss, enabling a dual-functional Transformer to restore the masked latents by predicting their missing values and conditional probability mass functions. Our ResiComp jointly optimizes compression efficiency and loss resilience. Moreover, ResiComp provides flexible coding modes, allowing for explicitly adjusting the efficiency-resilience trade-off in response to varying Internet or wireless network conditions. Extensive experiments demonstrate that ResiComp can significantly enhance the NIC's resilience against packet losses, while exhibits a worthy trade-off between compression efficiency and packet loss resilience.

Title: NeuroAMP: A Novel End-to-end General Purpose Deep Neural Amplifier for Personalized Hearing Aids
Authors: Shafique Ahmed, Ryandhimas E. Zezario, Hui-Guan Yuan, Amir Hussain, Hsin-Min Wang, Wei-Ho Chung, Yu Tsao
Abstract: The prevalence of hearing aids is increasing. However, optimizing the amplification processes of hearing aids remains challenging due to the complexity of integrating multiple modular components in traditional methods. To address this challenge, we present NeuroAMP, a novel deep neural network designed for end-to-end, personalized amplification in hearing aids. NeuroAMP leverages both spectral features and the listener's audiogram as inputs, and we investigate four architectures: Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Convolutional Recurrent Neural Network (CRNN), and Transformer. We also introduce Denoising NeuroAMP, an extension that integrates noise reduction along with amplification capabilities for improved performance in real-world scenarios. To enhance generalization, a comprehensive data augmentation strategy was employed during training on diverse speech (TIMIT and TMHINT) and music (Cadenza Challenge MUSIC) datasets. Evaluation using the Hearing Aid Speech Perception Index (HASPI), Hearing Aid Speech Quality Index (HASQI), and Hearing Aid Audio Quality Index (HAAQI) demonstrates that the Transformer architecture within NeuroAMP achieves the best performance, with SRCC scores of 0.9927 (HASQI) and 0.9905 (HASPI) on TIMIT, and 0.9738 (HAAQI) on the Cadenza Challenge MUSIC dataset. Notably, our data augmentation strategy maintains high performance on unseen datasets (e.g., VCTK, MUSDB18-HQ). Furthermore, Denoising NeuroAMP outperforms both the conventional NAL-R+WDRC approach and a two-stage baseline on the VoiceBank+DEMAND dataset, achieving a 10% improvement in both HASPI (0.90) and HASQI (0.59) scores. These results highlight the potential of NeuroAMP and Denoising NeuroAMP to deliver notable improvements in personalized hearing aid amplification.

Title: Blind Massive MIMO for Dense IoT Networks
Authors: Jeongjae Lee, Songnam Hong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the downlink communication challenges in heavy-load Internet-of-Things (IoT) networks supported by frequency-division-duplexing (FDD) millimeter-wave (mmWave) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems. The excessive overhead required for obtaining channel state information at the transmitter (CSIT) is essential to achieve high spectral efficiency through conventional massive MIMO techniques; however, it hinders the deployment of ultra-reliable low-latency communications (URLLC) and leads to significant energy expenditure, particularly in dense IoT networks. To address this challenge, we propose an innovative CSIT-Free MIMO precoding method, referred to as CIRculant information Classification via Linear Estimation (CIRCLE). Our major contribution is the design of a CSIT-independent (or deterministic) precoding, which is constructed by leveraging the circulant permutation of the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) matrix. This design enables interference-free signal combining at the IoT devices. Through theoretical analysis and simulations, we verify the effectiveness of the proposed CIRCLE method.

Title: Generalizable speech deepfake detection via meta-learned LoRA
Authors: Janne Laakkonen, Ivan Kukanov, Ville Hautamäki
Abstract: Generalizable deepfake detection can be formulated as a detection problem where labels (bonafide and fake) are fixed but distributional drift affects the deepfake set. We can always train our detector with one-selected attacks and bonafide data, but an attacker can generate new attacks by just retraining his generator with a different seed. One reasonable approach is to simply pool all different attack types available in training time. Our proposed approach is to utilize meta-learning in combination with LoRA adapters to learn the structure in the training data that is common to all attack types.

Title: Robust Multidimensional Graph Neural Networks for Signal Processing in Wireless Communications with Edge-Graph Information Bottleneck
Authors: Ziheng Liu, Jiayi Zhang, Yiyang Zhu, Enyu Shi, Bo Ai
Abstract: Signal processing is crucial for satisfying the high data rate requirements of future sixth-generation (6G) wireless networks. However, the rapid growth of wireless networks has brought about massive data traffic, which hinders the application of traditional optimization theory-based algorithms. Meanwhile, traditional graph neural networks (GNNs) focus on compressing inputs onto vertices to update representations, which often leads to their inability to effectively distinguish input features and severely weakens performance. In this context, designing efficient signal processing frameworks becomes imperative. Moreover, actual scenarios are susceptible to multipath interference and noise, resulting in specific differences between the received and actual information. To address these challenges, this paper incorporates multidimensional graph neural networks (MDGNNs) with edge-graph information bottleneck (EGIB) to design a robust framework for signal processing. Specifically, MDGNNs utilize hyper-edges instead of vertices to update representations to avoid indistinguishable features and reduce information loss, while EGIB encourages providing minimal sufficient information about outputs to avoid aggregation of irrelevant information. We numerically demonstrate that compared with existing frameworks, the proposed frameworks achieve excellent performance in terms of spectrum efficiency (SE) and network overhead under multiple signal processing tasks. Remarkably, as the interference noise increases, the SE performance of the proposed frameworks gradually stabilizes. This reveals the proposed frameworks have excellent robustness in interference prone environments, especially in wireless policies related to channel matrices.

Title: Nonlinear Feedback Linearization and LQG/LTR Control: A Comparative Study for a Single-Machine Infinite-Bus System
Authors: Pratik Vernekar
Abstract: This paper presents a comparative study of three advanced control strategies for a single-machine infinite-bus (SMIB) system: the nonlinear feedback linearizing controller (NFLC), the integral-NFLC (INFLC), and the linear-quadratic-Gaussian/loop transfer recovery (LQG/LTR) control. The NFLC and INFLC techniques use exact feedback linearization to precisely cancel the SMIB system nonlinearities, enabling the use of decentralized, linear, and optimal controllers for the decoupled generator and turbine-governor systems while remaining unaffected by the SMIB system's internal dynamics and operating conditions. In contrast, the LQG/LTR approach employs an enhanced Kalman filter, designed using the LTR procedure and a detailed frequency-domain loop-shaping analysis, to achieve a reasonable trade-off between optimal performance, noise/disturbance rejection, robustness recovery, and stability margins for the SMIB system. We provide a control synthesis framework for constructing practical, verifiable, scalable, and resilient linear and nonlinear controllers for SMIB and multi-machine power systems by utilizing a high-fidelity plant model for validation, a reduced-order control-design model, and the correlations between the two models' control inputs. Rigorous simulations and comparative analysis of the proposed controllers and a full-state linear-quadratic regulator show the benefits, constraints, and trade-offs of each controller in terms of transient response, steady-state error, robustness, rotor angle stability, frequency control, and voltage regulation under different operating conditions. Ultimately, this study aims to guide the selection of appropriate control strategies for large-scale power systems, enhancing the overall resilience and reliability of the electric grid.

This work presents the first systematic study of multi-die and multi-technology floorplanning. Unlike many conventional approaches, which are primarily driven by area and wirelength, this study additionally considers performance, power, and cost, highlighting the impact of technology selection. A simulated annealing method and a reinforcement learning techniques are developed. Experimental results show that the proposed techniques significantly outperform a naive baseline approach.

Title: SpeechT-RAG: Reliable Depression Detection in LLMs with Retrieval-Augmented Generation Using Speech Timing Information
Authors: Xiangyu Zhang, Hexin Liu, Qiquan Zhang, Beena Ahmed, Julien Epps
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have been increasingly adopted for health-related tasks, yet their performance in depression detection remains limited when relying solely on text input. While Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) typically enhances LLM capabilities, our experiments indicate that traditional text-based RAG systems struggle to significantly improve depression detection accuracy. This challenge stems partly from the rich depression-relevant information encoded in acoustic speech patterns information that current text-only approaches fail to capture effectively. To address this limitation, we conduct a systematic analysis of temporal speech patterns, comparing healthy individuals with those experiencing depression. Based on our findings, we introduce Speech Timing-based Retrieval-Augmented Generation, SpeechT-RAG, a novel system that leverages speech timing features for both accurate depression detection and reliable confidence estimation. This integrated approach not only outperforms traditional text-based RAG systems in detection accuracy but also enhances uncertainty quantification through a confidence scoring mechanism that naturally extends from the same temporal features. Our unified framework achieves comparable results to fine-tuned LLMs without additional training while simultaneously addressing the fundamental requirements for both accuracy and trustworthiness in mental health assessment.

Title: DT4ECG: A Dual-Task Learning Framework for ECG-Based Human Identity Recognition and Human Activity Detection
Authors: Siyu You, Boyuan Gu, Yanhui Yang, Shiyu Yu, Shisheng Guo
Abstract: This article introduces DT4ECG, an innovative dual-task learning framework for Electrocardiogram (ECG)-based human identity recognition and activity detection. The framework employs a robust one-dimensional convolutional neural network (1D-CNN) backbone integrated with residual blocks to extract discriminative ECG features. To enhance feature representation, we propose a novel Sequence Channel Attention (SCA) mechanism, which combines channel-wise and sequential context attention to prioritize informative features across both temporal and channel dimensions. Furthermore, to address gradient imbalance in multi-task learning, we integrate GradNorm, a technique that dynamically adjusts loss weights based on gradient magnitudes, ensuring balanced training across tasks. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of our model, achieving accuracy rates of 99.12% in ID classification and 90.11% in activity classification. These findings underscore the potential of the DT4ECG framework in enhancing security and user experience across various applications such as fitness monitoring and personalized healthcare, thereby presenting a transformative approach to integrating ECG-based biometrics in everyday technologies.

Title: Improved VMD Based Remote Heartbeat Estimation Utilizing 60GHz mmWave Radar
Authors: Boyuan Gu, Yanhui Yang, Siyu You, Haiyang Sun, Jiahui Sun, Shisheng Guo
Abstract: This study introduces an improved VMD based signal decomposition methodology for non-contact heartbeat estimation using millimeterwave (mmWave) radar. Specifically, we first analyze the signal model of the mmWave radar system. The Variational Mode Decomposition (VMD) integrated with the Newton-Raphson-based optimizer (NRBO) algorithm are sequentially utilized for cardiac mechanic signal (CMS) reconstruction. The estimation accuracy is enhanced by adaptively optimizing the VMD parameters including intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) and penalty factor. Eventually, the experimental results of 18 subjects validate the effectiveness of the proposed method by comparing with three commonly used baselines.

Title: Unveiling the Power of Complex-Valued Transformers in Wireless Communications
Authors: Yang Leng, Qingfeng Lin, Long-Yin Yung, Jingreng Lei, Yang Li, Yik-Chung Wu
Abstract: Utilizing complex-valued neural networks (CVNNs) in wireless communication tasks has received growing attention for their ability to provide natural and effective representation of complex-valued signals and data. However, existing studies typically employ complex-valued versions of simple neural network architectures. Not only they merely scratch the surface of the extensive range of modern deep learning techniques, theoretical understanding of the superior performance of CVNNs is missing. To this end, this paper aims to fill both the theoretical and practice gap of employing CVNNs in wireless communications. In particular, we provide a comprehensive description on the various operations in CVNNs and theoretically prove that the CVNN requires fewer layers than the real-valued counterpart to achieve a given approximation error of a continuous function. Furthermore, to advance CVNNs in the field of wireless communications, this paper focuses on the transformer model, which represents a more sophisticated deep learning architecture and has been shown to have excellent performance in wireless communications but only in its real-valued form. In this aspect, we propose a fundamental paradigm of complex-valued transformers for wireless communications. Leveraging this structure, we develop customized complex-valued transformers for three representative applications in wireless communications: channel estimation, user activity detection, and precoding design. These applications utilize transformers with varying levels of sophistication and span a variety of tasks, ranging from regression to classification, supervised to unsupervised learning, and specific module design to end-to-end design. Experimental results demonstrate the superior performance of the complex-valued transformers for the above three applications compared to other traditional real-valued neural network-based methods.

Title: Robust correlation measures for informative frequency band selection in heavy-tailed vibration signal
Authors: Justyna Hebda-Sobkowicz, Radosław Zimroz, Anil Kumar, Agnieszka Wyłomanska
Abstract: Vibration signals are commonly used to detect local damage in rotating machinery. However, raw signals are often noisy, particularly in crusher machines, where the technological process (falling pieces of rock) generates random impulses that complicate detection. To address this, signal pre-filtering (extracting the informative frequency band from noise-affected signals) is necessary. This paper proposes an algorithm for processing vibration signals from a bearing used in an ore crusher. Selecting informative frequency bands (IFBs) in the presence of impulsive noise is notably challenging. The approach employs correlation maps to detect cyclic behavior within specific frequency bands in the time-frequency domain (spectrogram), enabling the identification of IFBs. Robust correlation measures and median filtering are applied to enhance the correlation maps and improve the final IFB selection. Signal segmentation and the use of averaged results for IFB selection are also highlighted. The proposed trimmed and quadrant correlations are compablack with the Pearson and Kendall correlations using simulated signal, real vibration signal from crusher in mining industry and acoustic signal measublack on the test rig. Furthermore, the results of real vibration analyses are compablack with established IFB selectors, including the spectral kurtosis, the alpha selector and the conditional variance-based selector.

Title: Non-negative tensor factorization-based dependence map analysis for local damage detection in presence of non-Gaussian noise
Authors: Anna Michalak, Justyna Hebda-Sobkowicz, Anil Kumar, Radoslaw Zimroz, Rafal Zdunek, Agnieszka Wylomanska
Abstract: The time-frequency map (TFM) is frequently used in condition monitoring, necessitating further processing to select an informative frequency band (IFB) or directly detect damage. However, selecting an IFB is challenging due to the complexity of spectral structures, non-Gaussian disturbances, and overlapping fault signatures in vibration signals. Additionally, dynamic operating conditions and low signal-to-noise ratio further complicate the identification of relevant features that indicate damage. To solve this problem, the present work proposes a novel method for informative band selection and local damage detection in rolling element bearings, utilizing non-negative tensor factorization (NTF)-based dependence map analysis. The recently introduced concept of the dependence map is leveraged, with a set of these maps being factorized to separate informative components from non-informative ones. Dependence maps provide valuable information on the auto-similarity of spectral content, while NTF, a powerful tool commonly used in image processing for feature extraction, enhances this process. The combination of these methods allows for the extraction of IFBs, forming the basis for local damage detection. The effectiveness of the proposed method has been validated using both synthetic and real vibration signals corrupted with non-Gaussian disturbances.

Abstract: Text-to-audio (TTA) systems have recently demonstrated strong performance in synthesizing monaural audio from text. However, the task of generating binaural spatial audio from text, which provides a more immersive auditory experience by incorporating the sense of spatiality, have not been explored yet. In this work, we introduce text-guided binaural audio generation. As an early effort, we focus on the scenario where a monaural reference audio is given additionally. The core problem is to associate specific sound events with their directions, thereby creating binaural spatial audio. The challenge lies in the complexity of textual descriptions and the limited availability of single-source sound event datasets. To address this, we propose AudioSpa, an end-to-end model that applies large language models to process both acoustic and textual information. We employ fusion multi-head attention (FMHA) to integrate text tokens, which enhances the generation capability of the multimodal learning. Additionally, we propose a binaural source localization model to assess the quality of the generated audio. Finally, we design a data augmentation strategy to generate diverse datasets, which enables the model to spatialize sound events across various spatial positions. Experimental results demonstrate that our model is able to put sounds at the specified locations accurately. It achieves competitive performance in both localization accuracy and signal distortion.

Title: Reducing Computational Complexity of Rigidity-Based UAV Trajectory Optimization for Real-Time Cooperative Target Localization
Authors: Halim Lee, Jiwon Seo
Abstract: Accurate and swift localization of the target is crucial in emergencies. However, accurate position data of a target mobile device, typically obtained from global navigation satellite systems (GNSS), cellular networks, or WiFi, may not always be accessible to first responders. For instance, 1) accuracy and availability can be limited in challenging signal reception environments, and 2) in regions where emergency location services are not mandatory, certain mobile devices may not transmit their location during emergencies. As an alternative localization method, a network of unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) can be employed to passively locate targets by collecting radio frequency (RF) signal measurements, such as received signal strength (RSS). In these situations, UAV trajectories play a critical role in localization performance, influencing both accuracy and search time. Previous studies optimized UAV trajectories using the determinant of the Fisher information matrix (FIM), but its performance declines under unfavorable geometric conditions, such as when UAVs start from a single base, leading to position ambiguity. To address this, our prior work introduced a rigidity-based approach, which improved the search time compared to FIM-based methods in our simulation case. However, the high computational cost of rigidity-based optimization, primarily due to singular value decomposition (SVD), limits its practicality. In this paper, we applied techniques to reduce computational complexity, including randomized SVD, smooth SVD, and vertex pruning.

Title: Set-Based Position Ambiguity Reduction Method for Zonotope Shadow Matching in Urban Areas Using Estimated Multipath Errors
Authors: Sanghyun Kim, Jiwon Seo
Abstract: In urban areas, the quality of global navigation satellite system (GNSS) signals deteriorates, leading to reduced positioning accuracy. To address this issue, 3D-mapping-aided (3DMA) techniques, such as shadow matching and zonotope shadow matching (ZSM), have been proposed. However, these methods can introduce a problem known as multi-modal position ambiguity, making it challenging to select the exact mode in which the receiver is located. Accurately selecting the correct mode is essential for improving positioning accuracy. A previous study proposed a method that uses satellite-pseudorange consistency (SPC), calculated from pseudorange measurements, to select the mode containing the receiver. This method achieved a mode selection accuracy of approximately 78%. To further enhance accuracy, the study utilized pseudorange measurements collected at multiple timesteps from a fixed location and a trained line-of-sight (LOS) classifier. However, in practice, collecting data at multiple timesteps from the same location in dynamic environments is challenging. Moreover, the performance of the trained LOS classifier heavily depends on the surrounding environment, leading to low reliability. In this study, we propose a method that estimates and corrects multipath errors based on the mode distribution obtained from the output of ZSM and extract an enhanced SPC using the corrected pseudorange measurements. This enables high mode selection accuracy using only single-timestep pseudorange measurements, without requiring a trained LOS classifier.

Title: Numerical Differentiation-based Electrophysiology-Aware Adaptive ResNet for Inverse ECG Modeling
Authors: Lingzhen Zhu, Kenneth Bilchick, Jianxin Xie
Abstract: Electrocardiographic imaging aims to noninvasively reconstruct the electrical dynamic patterns on the heart surface from body-surface ECG measurements, aiding the mechanistic study of cardiac function. At the core of ECGI lies the inverse ECG problem, a mathematically ill-conditioned challenge where small body measurement errors or noise can lead to significant inaccuracies in the reconstructed heart-surface potentials. %Leveraging a well-developed electrophysiological (EP) model, our previous study developed an EP-informed deep learning framework, demonstrating promising effectiveness in improving cardiac map predictions. To improve the accuracy of ECGI and ensure that cardiac predictions adhere to established physical principles, recent advances have incorporated well-established electrophysiology (EP) laws into their model formulations. However, traditional EP-informed models encounter significant challenges, including overfitting to EP constraints, limitations in network scalability, and suboptimal initialization. These issues compromise prediction accuracy and stability, hindering their effectiveness in practical applications. This highlights the need for an advanced data analytic and predictive tool to achieve reliable cardiac electrodynamic restoration. Here, we present a Numerical Differentiation-based Electrophysiology-Aware Adaptive Residual neural Network (EAND-ARN) for robust inverse ECG modeling. Our method employs numerical differentiation to compute the spatiotemporal derivative, enabling EP constraints to be applied across a local spatiotemporal region, thereby strengthening the overall EP enforcement. Additionally, we design an adaptive residual network to improve gradient flow, enhancing predictive accuracy and mitigating issues with poor initialization. Experimental results show that EAND-ARN significantly outperforms existing methods in current practice.

Title: Hybrid Beamforming Design for Bistatic Integrated Sensing and Communication Systems
Authors: Tianhao Mao, Jie Yang, Le Liang, Shi Jin
Abstract: Integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) in millimeter wave is a key enabler for next-generation networks, which leverages large bandwidth and extensive antenna arrays, benefiting both communication and sensing functionalities. The associated high costs can be mitigated by adopting a hybrid beamforming structure. However, the well-studied monostatic ISAC systems face challenges related to full-duplex operation. To address this issue, this paper focuses on a three-dimensional bistatic configuration that requires only half-duplex base stations. To intuitively evaluate the error bound of bistatic sensing using orthogonal frequency division multiplexing waveforms, we propose a positioning scheme that combines angle-of-arrival and time-of-arrival estimation, deriving the closed-form expression of the position error bound (PEB). Using this PEB, we develop two hybrid beamforming algorithms for joint waveform design, aimed at maximizing achievable spectral efficiency (SE) while ensuring a predefined PEB threshold. The first algorithm leverages a Riemannian trust-region approach, achieving superior performance in terms of global optima and convergence speed compared to conventional gradient-based methods, but with higher complexity. In contrast, the second algorithm, which employs orthogonal matching pursuit, offers a more computationally efficient solution, delivering reasonable SE while maintaining the PEB constraint. Numerical results are provided to validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs.

Title: LMFCA-Net: A Lightweight Model for Multi-Channel Speech Enhancement with Efficient Narrow-Band and Cross-Band Attention
Authors: Yaokai Zhang, Hanchen Pei, Wanqi Wang, Gongping Huang
Abstract: Deep learning based end-to-end multi-channel speech enhancement methods have achieved impressive performance by leveraging sub-band, cross-band, and spatial information. However, these methods often demand substantial computational resources, limiting their practicality on terminal devices. This paper presents a lightweight multi-channel speech enhancement network with decoupled fully connected attention (LMFCA-Net). The proposed LMFCA-Net introduces time-axis decoupled fully-connected attention (T-FCA) and frequency-axis decoupled fully-connected attention (F-FCA) mechanisms to effectively capture long-range narrow-band and cross-band information without recurrent units. Experimental results show that LMFCA-Net performs comparably to state-of-the-art methods while significantly reducing computational complexity and latency, making it a promising solution for practical applications.

Title: Statistical and Deterministic RCS Characterization for ISAC Channel Modeling
Authors: Ali Waqar Azim, Ahmad Bazzi, Roberto Bomfin, Nikolaos Giakoumidis, Theodore S. Rappaport, Marwa Chafii
Abstract: In this study, we perform a statistical analysis of the radar cross section (RCS) for various test targets in an indoor factory at \(25\)-\(28\) GHz, with the goal of formulating parameters that may be used for target identification and other sensing applications for future wireless systems. The analysis is conducted based on measurements in monostatic and bistatic configurations for bistatic angles of \(20^\circ\), \(40^\circ\), and \(60^\circ\), which are functions of transmitter-receiver (T-R) and target positions, via accurate \(3\)dB beamwidth of \(10^\circ\) in both azimuth and elevation planes. The test targets include unmanned aerial vehicles, an autonomous mobile robot, and a robotic arm. We utilize parametric statistical distributions to fit the measured RCS data. The analysis reveals that the \textit{lognormal and gamma distributions} are effective in modeling the RCS of the test targets over different reflecting points of the target itself, i.e. when target is in motion. Additionally, we provide a framework for evaluating the deterministic bistatic RCS of a rectangular sheet of laminated wood, due to its widespread use in indoor hotspot environments. Novel deterministic and statistical RCS models are evaluated, incorporating dependencies on the bistatic angle, T-R distance (\(2\)m -\(10\)m) and the target. The results demonstrate that some proposed RCS models accurately fit the measured data, highlighting their applicability in bistatic configurations.

Title: Improving Rare-Word Recognition in Zero-Shot Settings
Authors: Yash Jogi, Vaibhav Aggarwal, Shabari S Nair, Yash Verma, Aayush Kubba
Abstract: Whisper, despite being trained on 680K hours of web-scaled audio data, faces difficulty in recognising rare words like domain-specific terms, with a solution being contextual biasing through prompting. To improve upon this method, in this paper, we propose a supervised learning strategy to fine-tune Whisper for contextual biasing instruction. We demonstrate that by using only 670 hours of Common Voice English set for fine-tuning, our model generalises to 11 diverse open-source English datasets, achieving a 45.6% improvement in recognition of rare words and 60.8% improvement in recognition of words unseen during fine-tuning over the baseline method. Surprisingly, our model's contextual biasing ability generalises even to languages unseen during fine-tuning.

Title: Runtime Enforcement of CPS against Signal Temporal Logic
Authors: Han Su, Saumya Shankar, Srinivas Pinisetty, Partha S. Roop, Naijun Zhan
Abstract: Cyber-Physical Systems (CPSs), especially those involving autonomy, need guarantees of their safety. Runtime Enforcement (RE) is a lightweight method to formally ensure that some specified properties are satisfied over the executions of the system. Hence, there is recent interest in the RE of CPS. However, existing methods are not designed to tackle specifications suitable for the hybrid dynamics of CPS. With this in mind, we develop runtime enforcement of CPS using properties defined in Signal Temporal Logic (STL). In this work, we aim to construct a runtime enforcer for a given STL formula to minimally modify a signal to satisfy the formula. To achieve this, the STL formula to be enforced is first translated into a timed transducer, while the signal to be corrected is encoded as timed words. We provide timed transducers for the temporal operators \emph{until} and \emph{release} noting that other temporal operators can be expressed using these two. Our approach enables effective enforcement of STL properties for CPS. A case study is provided to illustrate the approach and generate empirical evidence of its suitability for CPS.

Title: Uniform Resampling vs. Image Blur: Aliasing Approximation via Isotropic Gaussian Filtering
Authors: Suayb S. Arslan, Lukas Vogelsang, Michal Fux, Pawan Sinha
Abstract: One of the key approximations to range simulation is downscaling the image, dictated by the natural trigonometric relationships that arise due to long-distance viewing. It is well-known that standard downsampling applied to an image without prior low-pass filtering leads to a type of signal distortion called $aliasing$. In this study, we aim at modeling the distortion due to aliasing and show that a downsampled/upsampled image after an interpolation process can be very well approximated through the application of isotropic Gaussian low-pass filtering to the original image. In other words, the distortion due to aliasing can approximately be generated by low-pass filtering the image with a carefully determined cut-off frequency. We have found that the standard deviation of the isotropic Gaussian kernel $\sigma$ and the reduction factor $m$ (also called downsampling ratio) satisfy an approximate $m \approx 2 \sigma$ relationship. We provide both theoretical and practical arguments using two relatively small face datasets (Chicago DB, LRFID) as well as TinyImageNet to corroborate this empirically observed relationship.

Title: Training Channel Selection for Learning-based 1-bit Precoding in Massive MU-MIMO
Authors: Sitian Li, Andreas Burg, Alexios Balatsoukas-Stimming
Abstract: Learning-based algorithms have gained great popularity in communications since they often outperform even carefully engineered solutions by learning from training samples. In this paper, we show that the selection of appropriate training examples can be important for the performance of such learning-based algorithms. In particular, we consider non-linear 1-bit precoding for massive multi-user MIMO systems using the C2PO algorithm. While previous works have already shown the advantages of learning critical coefficients of this algorithm, we demonstrate that straightforward selection of training samples that follow the channel model distribution does not necessarily lead to the best result. Instead, we provide a strategy to generate training data based on the specific properties of the algorithm, which significantly improves its error floor performance.

Title: Synergizing Covert Transmission and mmWave ISAC for Secure IoT Systems
Authors: Lingyun Xu, Bowen Wang, Ziyang Cheng
Abstract: This work focuses on the synergy of physical layer covert transmission and millimeter wave (mmWave) integrated sensing and communication (ISAC) to improve the performance, and enable secure internet of things (IoT) systems. Specifically, we employ a physical layer covert transmission as a prism, which can achieve simultaneously transmitting confidential signals to a covert communication user equipment (UE) in the presence of a warden and regular communication UEs. We design the transmit beamforming to guarantee information transmission security, communication quality-of-service (QoS) and sensing accuracy. By considering two different beamforming architectures, i.e., fully digital beamforming (FDBF) and hybrid beamforming (HBF), an optimal design method and a low-cost beamforming scheme are proposed to address the corresponding problems, respectively. Numerical simulations validate the effectiveness and superiority of the proposed FDBF/HBF algorithms compared with traditional algorithms in terms of information transmission security, communication QoS and target detection performance.

Title: On Quantizing Neural Representation for Variable-Rate Video Coding
Authors: Junqi Shi, Zhujia Chen, Hanfei Li, Qi Zhao, Ming Lu, Tong Chen, Zhan Ma
Abstract: This work introduces NeuroQuant, a novel post-training quantization (PTQ) approach tailored to non-generalized Implicit Neural Representations for variable-rate Video Coding (INR-VC). Unlike existing methods that require extensive weight retraining for each target bitrate, we hypothesize that variable-rate coding can be achieved by adjusting quantization parameters (QPs) of pre-trained weights. Our study reveals that traditional quantization methods, which assume inter-layer independence, are ineffective for non-generalized INR-VC models due to significant dependencies across layers. To address this, we redefine variable-rate INR-VC as a mixed-precision quantization problem and establish a theoretical framework for sensitivity criteria aimed at simplified, fine-grained rate control. Additionally, we propose network-wise calibration and channel-wise quantization strategies to minimize quantization-induced errors, arriving at a unified formula for representation-oriented PTQ calibration. Our experimental evaluations demonstrate that NeuroQuant significantly outperforms existing techniques in varying bitwidth quantization and compression efficiency, accelerating encoding by up to eight times and enabling quantization down to INT2 with minimal reconstruction loss. This work introduces variable-rate INR-VC for the first time and lays a theoretical foundation for future research in rate-distortion optimization, advancing the field of video coding technology. The materials will be available at this https URL.

Title: A method for signal components identification in acoustic signal with non-Gaussian background noise using clustering of data in time-frequency domain
Authors: A Drewnicka, A Michalak, R Zimroz, A Kumar, A Wyłomańska, J Wodecki
Abstract: This paper presents a novel method for fault detection in vibration/acoustic signals contaminated with non-Gaussian noise, specifically addressing the challenge of random impulsive and wideband disturbances in industrial measurements. While damage detection in Gaussian noise environments is well understood, high-amplitude non-cyclic impulsive disturbances arising from random aspects of industrial processes, such as non-uniform operations and random impacts, pose significant analytical challenges. The proposed method analyzes the distribution densities of spectral vectors derived from spectrograms. It considers a simple additive model consisting of the signal of interest (SOI) and Gaussian and non-Gaussian noise. Using the density-based spatial clustering algorithm (DBSCAN), the method isolates distinct classes of spectral vectors from the spectrogram, effectively separating different signal behaviors and extracting fault-related information. The effectiveness of the proposed method was validated using an envelope spectrum-based indicator (ENVSI) and successfully demonstrated on real signals from an industrial machine with a faulty bearing.

Title: Signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals
Authors: Harry H. Behjat, Carl-Fredrik Westin, Rik Ossenkoppele, Dimitri Van De Ville
Abstract: Analysis of signals defined on complex topologies modeled by graphs is a topic of increasing interest. Signal decomposition plays a crucial role in the representation and processing of such information, in particular, to process graph signals based on notions of scale (e.g., coarse to fine). The graph spectrum is more irregular than for conventional domains; i.e., it is influenced by graph topology, and, therefore, assumptions about spectral representations of graph signals are not easy to make. Here, we propose a tight frame design that is adapted to the graph Laplacian spectral content of given classes of graph signals. The design is based on using the ensemble energy spectral density, a notion of spectral content of given signal sets that we determine either directly using the graph Fourier transform or indirectly through a polynomial-based approximation scheme. The approximation scheme has the benefit that (i) it does not require eigendecomposition of the Laplacian matrix making the method feasible for large graphs, and (ii) it leads to a smooth estimate of the spectral content. A prototype system of spectral kernels each capturing an equal amount of energy is initially defined and subsequently warped using the signal set's ensemble energy spectral density such that the resulting subbands each capture an equal amount of ensemble energy. This approach accounts at the same time for graph topology and signal features, and it provides a meaningful interpretation of subbands in terms of coarse-to-fine representations. We also show how more simplified designs of signal-adapted decomposition of graph signals can be adopted based on ensemble energy estimates. We show the application of proposed methods on the Minnesota road graph and three different designs of brain graphs derived from neuroimaging data.

Furthermore, we present experimental verification in a complex application scenario.

Title: A MIMO Wireless Channel Foundation Model via CIR-CSI Consistency
Authors: Jun Jiang, Wenjun Yu, Yunfan Li, Yuan Gao, Shugong Xu
Abstract: In the field of artificial intelligence, self-supervised learning has demonstrated superior generalization capabilities by leveraging large-scale unlabeled datasets for pretraining, which is especially critical for wireless communication models to adapt to a variety of scenarios. This paper innovatively treats Channel State Information (CSI) and Channel Impulse Response (CIR) as naturally aligned multi-modal data and proposes the first MIMO wireless channel foundation model, named CSI-CLIP. By effectively capturing the joint representations of both CIR and CSI, CSI-CLIP exhibits remarkable adaptability across scenarios and robust feature extraction capabilities. Experimental results show that in positioning task, CSI-CLIP reduces the mean error distance by 22%; in beam management task, it increases accuracy by 1% compared to traditional supervised methods, as well as in the channel identification task. These improvements not only highlight the potential and value of CSI-CLIP in integrating sensing and communication but also demonstrate its significant advantages over existing techniques. Moreover, viewing CSI and CIR as multi-modal pairs and contrastive learning for wireless channel foundation model open up new research directions in the domain of MIMO wireless communications.

Title: Inception networks, Data Augmentation and Transfer Learning in EEG-based photosensitivity diagnosis
Authors: Fernando Moncada Martins, Víctor M. González, José R. Villar, Beatriz García López, Ana Isabel Gómez-Menéndez
Abstract: Photosensitivity refers to a neurophysiological condition in which the brain generates epileptic discharges known as Photoparoxysmal Responses (PPR) in response to light this http URL severe cases, these PPR can lead to epileptic seizures. The standardized diagnostic procedure for this condition is called Intermittent Photic Stimulation. During this procedure, the patient is exposed to a flashing light, aiming to trigger these epileptic reactions while preventing their full development. Meanwhile, brain activity is monitored using Electroencephalography, which is visually analyzed by clinical staff to identify these responses. Hence, the automatic detection of PPR becomes a highly unbalanced problem that has been barely studied in the literature due to photosensitivity's low prevalence. This research tackles this problem and proposes using Inception-based Deep Learning (DL) neural networks that, together with transfer learning, are trained in epilepsy seizure detection and tuned in the PPR automatic detection task. A Data Augmentation (DA) technique is also applied to balance the available data set, evaluating its effects on the DL models. The proposal outperformed state-of-the-art solutions in the literature, achieving higher ratios on standard performance metrics, and with DA significantly improving the Sensitivity without affecting Accuracy and Specificity. This project is currently being developed with patients from Burgos University Hospital, Spain

Title: WeVibe: Weight Change Estimation Through Audio-Induced Shelf Vibrations In Autonomous Stores
Authors: Jiale Zhang, Yuyan Wu, Jesse R Codling, Yen Cheng Chang, Julia Gersey, Pei Zhang, Hae Young Noh, Yiwen Dong
Abstract: Weight change estimation is crucial in various applications, particularly for detecting pick-up and put-back actions when people interact with the shelf while shopping in autonomous stores. Moreover, accurate weight change estimation allows autonomous stores to automatically identify items being picked up or put back, ensuring precise cost estimation. However, the conventional approach of estimating weight changes requires specialized weight-sensing shelves, which are densely deployed weight scales, incurring intensive sensor consumption and high costs. Prior works explored the vibration-based weight sensing method, but they failed when the location of weight change varies. In response to these limitations, we made the following contributions: (1) We propose WeVibe, a first item weight change estimation system through active shelf vibration sensing. The main intuition of the system is that the weight placed on the shelf influences the dynamic vibration response of the shelf, thus altering the shelf vibration patterns. (2) We model a physics-informed relationship between the shelf vibration response and item weight across multiple locations on the shelf based on structural dynamics theory. This relationship is linear and allows easy training of a weight estimation model at a new location without heavy data collection. (3) We evaluate our system on a gondola shelf organized as the real-store settings. WeVibe achieved a mean absolute error down to 38.07g and a standard deviation of 31.2g with one sensor and 10% samples from three weight classes on estimating weight change from 0g to 450g, which can be leveraged for differentiating items with more than 100g differences.

Title: BS-Breath: Respiration Sensing with Cell-free Massive MIMO
Authors: Haoqiu Xiong, Robbert Beerten, Zhuangzhuang Cui, Yang Miao, Sofie Pollin
Abstract: This paper demonstrates the feasibility of respiration pattern estimation utilizing a communication-centric cellfree massive MIMO OFDM Base Station (BS). The sensing target is typically positioned near the User Equipment (UE), which transmits uplink pilots to the BS. Our results demonstrate the potential of massive MIMO systems for accurate and reliable vital sign estimation. Initially, we adopt a single antenna sensing solution that combines multiple subcarriers and a breathing projection to align the 2D complex breathing pattern to a single displacement dimension. Then, Weighted Antenna Combining (WAC) aggregates the 1D breathing signals from multiple antennas. The results demonstrate that the combination of space-frequency resources specifically in terms of subcarriers and antennas yields higher accuracy than using only a single antenna or subcarrier. Our results significantly improved respiration estimation accuracy by using multiple subcarriers and antennas. With WAC, we achieved an average correlation of 0.8 with ground truth data, compared to 0.6 for single antenna or subcarrier methods, a 0.2 correlation increase. Moreover, the system produced perfect breathing rate estimates. These findings suggest that the limited bandwidth (18 MHz in the testbed) can be effectively compensated by utilizing spatial resources, such as distributed antennas.

Title: Spiking Neural Network Feature Discrimination Boosts Modality Fusion
Authors: Katerina Maria Oikonomou, Ioannis Kansizoglou, Antonios Gasteratos
Abstract: Feature discrimination is a crucial aspect of neural network design, as it directly impacts the network's ability to distinguish between classes and generalize across diverse datasets. The accomplishment of achieving high-quality feature representations ensures high intra-class separability and poses one of the most challenging research directions. While conventional deep neural networks (DNNs) rely on complex transformations and very deep networks to come up with meaningful feature representations, they usually require days of training and consume significant energy amounts. To this end, spiking neural networks (SNNs) offer a promising alternative. SNN's ability to capture temporal and spatial dependencies renders them particularly suitable for complex tasks, where multi-modal data are required. In this paper, we propose a feature discrimination approach for multi-modal learning with SNNs, focusing on audio-visual data. We employ deep spiking residual learning for visual modality processing and a simpler yet efficient spiking network for auditory modality processing. Lastly, we deploy a spiking multilayer perceptron for modality fusion. We present our findings and evaluate our approach against similar works in the field of classification challenges. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work investigating feature discrimination in SNNs.

Title: Real Time Control of Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform Using Concerto Reinforcement Learning
Authors: Zhang Minghao, Yang Xiaojun, Wang Zhihe, Wang Liang
Abstract: This paper introduces the CRL2RT algorithm, an advanced reinforcement learning method aimed at improving the real-time control performance of the Direct-Drive Tandem-Wing Experimental Platform (DDTWEP). Inspired by dragonfly flight, DDTWEP's tandem wing structure causes nonlinear and unsteady aerodynamic interactions, leading to complex load behaviors during pitch, roll, and yaw maneuvers. These complexities challenge stable motion control at high frequencies (2000 Hz). To overcome these issues, we developed the CRL2RT algorithm, which combines classical control elements with reinforcement learning-based controllers using a time-interleaved architecture and a rule-based policy composer. This integration ensures finite-time convergence and single-life adaptability. Experimental results under various conditions, including different flapping frequencies and yaw disturbances, show that CRL2RT achieves a control frequency surpassing 2500 Hz on standard CPUs. Additionally, when integrated with classical controllers like PID, Adaptive PID, and Model Reference Adaptive Control (MRAC), CRL2RT enhances tracking performance by 18.3% to 60.7%. These findings demonstrate CRL2RT's broad applicability and superior performance in complex real-time control scenarios, validating its effectiveness in overcoming existing control strategy limitations and advancing robust, efficient real-time control for biomimetic aerial vehicles.

Title: Quaternion-Hadamard Network: A Novel Defense Against Adversarial Attacks with a New Dataset
Authors: Vladimir Frants, Sos Agaian
Abstract: This paper addresses the vulnerability of deep-learning models designed for rain, snow, and haze removal. Despite enhancing image quality in adverse weather, these models are susceptible to adversarial attacks that compromise their effectiveness. Traditional defenses such as adversarial training and model distillation often require extensive retraining, making them costly and impractical for real-world deployment. While denoising and super-resolution techniques can aid image classification models, they impose high computational demands and introduce visual artifacts that hinder image processing tasks. We propose a model-agnostic defense against first-order white-box adversarial attacks using the Quaternion-Hadamard Network (QHNet) to tackle these challenges. White-box attacks are particularly difficult to defend against since attackers have full access to the model's architecture, weights, and training procedures. Our defense introduces the Quaternion Hadamard Denoising Convolutional Block (QHDCB) and the Quaternion Denoising Residual Block (QDRB), leveraging polynomial thresholding. QHNet incorporates these blocks within an encoder-decoder architecture, enhanced by feature refinement, to effectively neutralize adversarial noise. Additionally, we introduce the Adversarial Weather Conditions Vision Dataset (AWCVD), created by applying first-order gradient attacks on state-of-the-art weather removal techniques in scenarios involving haze, rain streaks, and snow. Using PSNR and SSIM metrics, we demonstrate that QHNet significantly enhances the robustness of low-level computer vision models against adversarial attacks compared with state-of-the-art denoising and super-resolution techniques. The source code and dataset will be released alongside the final version of this paper.

Title: YNote: A Novel Music Notation for Fine-Tuning LLMs in Music Generation
Authors: Shao-Chien Lu, Chen-Chen Yeh, Hui-Lin Cho, Chun-Chieh Hsu, Tsai-Ling Hsu, Cheng-Han Wu, Timothy K. Shih, Yu-Cheng Lin
Abstract: The field of music generation using Large Language Models (LLMs) is evolving rapidly, yet existing music notation systems, such as MIDI, ABC Notation, and MusicXML, remain too complex for effective fine-tuning of LLMs. These formats are difficult for both machines and humans to interpret due to their variability and intricate structure. To address these challenges, we introduce YNote, a simplified music notation system that uses only four characters to represent a note and its pitch. YNote's fixed format ensures consistency, making it easy to read and more suitable for fine-tuning LLMs. In our experiments, we fine-tuned GPT-2 (124M) on a YNote-encoded dataset and achieved BLEU and ROUGE scores of 0.883 and 0.766, respectively. With just two notes as prompts, the model was able to generate coherent and stylistically relevant music. We believe YNote offers a practical alternative to existing music notations for machine learning applications and has the potential to significantly enhance the quality of music generation using LLMs.

Title: Multi-Objective Planning with Contextual Lexicographic Reward Preferences
Authors: Pulkit Rustagi, Yashwanthi Anand, Sandhya Saisubramanian
Abstract: Autonomous agents are often required to plan under multiple objectives whose preference ordering varies based on context. The agent may encounter multiple contexts during its course of operation, each imposing a distinct lexicographic ordering over the objectives, with potentially different reward functions associated with each context. Existing approaches to multi-objective planning typically consider a single preference ordering over the objectives, across the state space, and do not support planning under multiple objective orderings within an environment. We present Contextual Lexicographic Markov Decision Process (CLMDP), a framework that enables planning under varying lexicographic objective orderings, depending on the context. In a CLMDP, both the objective ordering at a state and the associated reward functions are determined by the context. We employ a Bayesian approach to infer a state-context mapping from expert trajectories. Our algorithm to solve a CLMDP first computes a policy for each objective ordering and then combines them into a single context-aware policy that is valid and cycle-free. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is evaluated in simulation and using a mobile robot.

Title: F-StrIPE: Fast Structure-Informed Positional Encoding for Symbolic Music Generation
Authors: Manvi Agarwal (IP Paris, LTCI, IDS), Changhong Wang (LTCI), Gael Richard (S2A, IDS)
Abstract: While music remains a challenging domain for generative models like Transformers, recent progress has been made by exploiting suitable musically-informed priors. One technique to leverage information about musical structure in Transformers is inserting such knowledge into the positional encoding (PE) module. However, Transformers carry a quadratic cost in sequence length. In this paper, we propose F-StrIPE, a structure-informed PE scheme that works in linear complexity. Using existing kernel approximation techniques based on random features, we show that F-StrIPE is a generalization of Stochastic Positional Encoding (SPE). We illustrate the empirical merits of F-StrIPE using melody harmonization for symbolic music.

Title: Multi-view 3D surface reconstruction from SAR images by inverse rendering
Authors: Emile Barbier--Renard (IDS, IMAGES), Florence Tupin (IMAGES, IDS), Nicolas Trouvé, Loïc Denis (LabHC)
Abstract: 3D reconstruction of a scene from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) images mainly relies on interferometric measurements, which involve strict constraints on the acquisition process. These last years, progress in deep learning has significantly advanced 3D reconstruction from multiple views in optical imaging, mainly through reconstruction-by-synthesis approaches pioneered by Neural Radiance Fields. In this paper, we propose a new inverse rendering method for 3D reconstruction from unconstrained SAR images, drawing inspiration from optical approaches. First, we introduce a new simplified differentiable SAR rendering model, able to synthesize images from a digital elevation model and a radar backscattering coefficients map. Then, we introduce a coarse-to-fine strategy to train a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) to fit the height and appearance of a given radar scene from a few SAR views. Finally, we demonstrate the surface reconstruction capabilities of our method on synthetic SAR images produced by ONERA's physically-based EMPRISE simulator. Our method showcases the potential of exploiting geometric disparities in SAR images and paves the way for multi-sensor data fusion.

Abstract: A control allocation algorithm using control Lyapunov functions to determine stabilizing charges and thrusts of hybrid Coulomb spacecraft formations (HCSFs) is presented. The goal is to stabilize a desired configuration while minimizing the thruster actuation and maximizing Coulomb actuation to minimize propellant usage. A proportion of the decrease of the control Lyapunov function is designated for Coulomb actuation and the rest is performed by thrusters. Simulations show that an 85% reduction of propellant compared to using solely thrusters is attainable using the proposed algorithm. It is shown that the best role for thrusters in a HCSF is to provide small corrections that cannot be provided by Coulomb actuation.

Title: Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning for Collision Avoidance in Human-Machine Shared Control
Authors: Shiyue Zhao, Junzhi Zhang, Neda Masoud, Jianxiong Li, Yinan Zheng, Xiaohui Hou
Abstract: Human-machine shared control in critical collision scenarios aims to aid drivers' accident avoidance through intervening only when necessary. Existing methods count on replanning collision-free trajectories and imposing human-machine tracking, which usually interrupts the driver's intent and increases the risk of conflict. Additionally, the lack of guaranteed trajectory feasibility under extreme conditions can compromise safety and reliability. This paper introduces a Reachability-Aware Reinforcement Learning framework for shared control, guided by Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) reachability analysis. Machine intervention is activated only when the vehicle approaches the Collision Avoidance Reachable Set (CARS), which represents states where collision is unavoidable. First, we precompute the reachability distributions and the CARS by solving the Bellman equation using offline data. To reduce human-machine conflicts, we develop a driver model for sudden obstacles and propose an authority allocation strategy considering key collision avoidance features. Finally, we train a reinforcement learning agent to reduce human-machine conflicts while enforcing the hard constraint of avoiding entry into the CARS. The proposed method was tested on a real vehicle platform. Results show that the controller intervenes effectively near CARS to prevent collisions while maintaining improved original driving task performance. Robustness analysis further supports its flexibility across different driver attributes.

Title: Demonstration of a planar multimodal periodic filter at THz frequencies
Authors: Ali Dehghanian, Mohsen Haghighat, Thomas Darcie, Levi Smith
Abstract: This paper presents a planar multimodal periodic filter that is constructed from alternating sections of coplanar stripline and the odd-mode of a finite-ground plane coplanar waveguide constructed on a 1 um silicon nitride substrate to facilitate operation at THz frequencies. The multimode configuration differs from standard single-mode periodic filters and enables flexible designs and the possibility for active control of the filter characteristics. For this proof-of-concept, we present the relevant theory and design procedures required to develop a band-stop filter that has a center frequency of fc = 0.8 THz and a bandwidth of df = 0.07 THz. We find good agreement between theory, simulation, and experiment.

Title: Hybrid Deepfake Image Detection: A Comprehensive Dataset-Driven Approach Integrating Convolutional and Attention Mechanisms with Frequency Domain Features
Authors: Kafi Anan, Anindya Bhattacharjee, Ashir Intesher, Kaidul Islam, Abrar Assaeem Fuad, Utsab Saha, Hafiz Imtiaz
Abstract: Effective deepfake detection tools are becoming increasingly essential over the last few years due to the growing usage of deepfakes in unethical practices. There exists a diverse range of deepfake generation techniques, which makes it challenging to develop an accurate universal detection mechanism. The 2025 Signal Processing Cup (DFWild-Cup competition) provided a diverse dataset of deepfake images, which are generated from multiple deepfake image generators, for training machine learning model(s) to emphasize the generalization of deepfake detection. To this end, we proposed an ensemble-based approach that employs three different neural network architectures: a ResNet-34-based architecture, a data-efficient image transformer (DeiT), and an XceptionNet with Wavelet Transform to capture both local and global features of deepfakes. We visualize the specific regions that these models focus for classification using Grad-CAM, and empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of these models in grouping real and fake images into cohesive clusters using t-SNE plots. Individually, the ResNet-34 architecture has achieved 88.9% accuracy, whereas the Xception network and the DeiT architecture have achieved 87.76% and 89.32% accuracy, respectively. With these networks, our weighted ensemble model achieves an excellent accuracy of 93.23% on the validation dataset of the SP Cup 2025 competition. Finally, the confusion matrix and an Area Under the ROC curve of 97.44% further confirm the stability of our proposed method.

Authors: Sanggeon Yun, Ryozo Masukawa, Hanning Chen, SungHeon Jeong, Wenjun Huang, Arghavan Rezvani, Minhyoung Na, Yoshiki Yamaguchi, Mohsen Imani
Abstract: The escalating challenges of managing vast sensor-generated data, particularly in audio applications, necessitate innovative solutions. Current systems face significant computational and storage demands, especially in real-time applications like gunshot detection systems (GSDS), and the proliferation of edge sensors exacerbates these issues. This paper proposes a groundbreaking approach with a near-sensor model tailored for intelligent audio-sensing frameworks. Utilizing a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) module, convolutional neural network (CNN) layers, and HyperDimensional Computing (HDC), our model excels in low-energy, rapid inference, and online learning. It is highly adaptable for efficient ASIC design implementation, offering superior energy efficiency compared to conventional embedded CPUs or GPUs, and is compatible with the trend of shrinking microphone sensor sizes. Comprehensive evaluations at both software and hardware levels underscore the model's efficacy. Software assessments through detailed ROC curve analysis revealed a delicate balance between energy conservation and quality loss, achieving up to 82.1% energy savings with only 1.39% quality loss. Hardware evaluations highlight the model's commendable energy efficiency when implemented via ASIC design, especially with the Google Edge TPU, showcasing its superiority over prevalent embedded CPUs and GPUs.

Title: Sparse learning with concave regularization: relaxation of the irrepresentable condition
Authors: V. Cerone, S. M. Fosson, D. Regruto, A. Salam
Abstract: Learning sparse models from data is an important task in all those frameworks where relevant information should be identified within a large dataset. This can be achieved by formulating and solving suitable sparsity promoting optimization problems. As to linear regression models, Lasso is the most popular convex approach, based on an $\ell_1$-norm regularization. In contrast, in this paper, we analyse a concave regularized approach, and we prove that it relaxes the irrepresentable condition, which is sufficient and essentially necessary for Lasso to select the right significant parameters. In practice, this has the benefit of reducing the number of necessary measurements with respect to Lasso. Since the proposed problem is non-convex, we also discuss different algorithms to solve it, and we illustrate the obtained enhancement via numerical experiments.

Title: GS-GVINS: A Tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System Augmented by 3D Gaussian Splatting
Authors: Zelin Zhou, Saurav Uprety, Shichuang Nie, Hongzhou Yang
Abstract: Recently, the emergence of 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS) has drawn significant attention in the area of 3D map reconstruction and visual SLAM. While extensive research has explored 3DGS for indoor trajectory tracking using visual sensor alone or in combination with Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) and Inertial Measurement Unit (IMU), its integration with GNSS for large-scale outdoor navigation remains underexplored. To address these concerns, we proposed GS-GVINS: a tightly-integrated GNSS-Visual-Inertial Navigation System augmented by 3DGS. This system leverages 3D Gaussian as a continuous differentiable scene representation in largescale outdoor environments, enhancing navigation performance through the constructed 3D Gaussian map. Notably, GS-GVINS is the first GNSS-Visual-Inertial navigation application that directly utilizes the analytical jacobians of SE3 camera pose with respect to 3D Gaussians. To maintain the quality of 3DGS rendering in extreme dynamic states, we introduce a motionaware 3D Gaussian pruning mechanism, updating the map based on relative pose translation and the accumulated opacity along the camera ray. For validation, we test our system under different driving environments: open-sky, sub-urban, and urban. Both self-collected and public datasets are used for evaluation. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of GS-GVINS in enhancing navigation accuracy across diverse driving environments.

Title: A Physics-Informed Machine Learning Framework for Safe and Optimal Control of Autonomous Systems
Authors: Manan Tayal, Aditya Singh, Shishir Kolathaya, Somil Bansal
Abstract: As autonomous systems become more ubiquitous in daily life, ensuring high performance with guaranteed safety is crucial. However, safety and performance could be competing objectives, which makes their co-optimization difficult. Learning-based methods, such as Constrained Reinforcement Learning (CRL), achieve strong performance but lack formal safety guarantees due to safety being enforced as soft constraints, limiting their use in safety-critical settings. Conversely, formal methods such as Hamilton-Jacobi (HJ) Reachability Analysis and Control Barrier Functions (CBFs) provide rigorous safety assurances but often neglect performance, resulting in overly conservative controllers. To bridge this gap, we formulate the co-optimization of safety and performance as a state-constrained optimal control problem, where performance objectives are encoded via a cost function and safety requirements are imposed as state constraints. We demonstrate that the resultant value function satisfies a Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman (HJB) equation, which we approximate efficiently using a novel physics-informed machine learning framework. In addition, we introduce a conformal prediction-based verification strategy to quantify the learning errors, recovering a high-confidence safety value function, along with a probabilistic error bound on performance degradation. Through several case studies, we demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed framework in enabling scalable learning of safe and performant controllers for complex, high-dimensional autonomous systems.

Title: FELLE: Autoregressive Speech Synthesis with Token-Wise Coarse-to-Fine Flow Matching
Authors: Hui Wang, Shujie Liu, Lingwei Meng, Jinyu Li, Yifan Yang, Shiwan Zhao, Haiyang Sun, Yanqing Liu, Haoqin Sun, Jiaming Zhou, Yan Lu, Yong Qin
Abstract: To advance continuous-valued token modeling and temporal-coherence enforcement, we propose FELLE, an autoregressive model that integrates language modeling with token-wise flow matching. By leveraging the autoregressive nature of language models and the generative efficacy of flow matching, FELLE effectively predicts continuous-valued tokens (mel-spectrograms). For each continuous-valued token, FELLE modifies the general prior distribution in flow matching by incorporating information from the previous step, improving coherence and stability. Furthermore, to enhance synthesis quality, FELLE introduces a coarse-to-fine flow-matching mechanism, generating continuous-valued tokens hierarchically, conditioned on the language model's output. Experimental results demonstrate the potential of incorporating flow-matching techniques in autoregressive mel-spectrogram modeling, leading to significant improvements in TTS generation quality, as shown in this https URL.

Title: TAPS: Throat and Acoustic Paired Speech Dataset for Deep Learning-Based Speech Enhancement
Authors: Yunsik Kim, Yonghun Song, Yoonyoung Chung
Abstract: In high-noise environments such as factories, subways, and busy streets, capturing clear speech is challenging due to background noise. Throat microphones provide a solution with their noise-suppressing properties, reducing the noise while recording speech. However, a significant limitation remains: high-frequency information is attenuated as sound waves pass through skin and tissue, reducing speech clarity. Recent deep learning approaches have shown promise in enhancing throat microphone recordings, but further progress is constrained by the absence of standardized dataset. We introduce a throat and acoustic paired speech dataset (TAPS), a collection of paired utterances recorded from 60 native Korean speakers using throat and acoustic microphones. To demonstrate the TAPS's utility, we tested three baseline deep learning models and identified the mapping-based approach as superior in improving speech quality and restoring content. Additionally, we propose an optimal method to mitigate the signal mismatch between throat and acoustic microphones, ensuring model performance. These results highlight the potential of TAPS to serve as a standardized dataset and advance research in throat microphone-based speech enhancement.

Title: Dictionary-Learning-Based Data Pruning for System Identification
Authors: Tingna Wang (1 and 3), Sikai Zhang (2), Limin Sun (1, 3 and 4) ((1) Department of Bridge Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China, (2) Baosight Software (3) Shanghai Qi Zhi Institute, Shanghai, China, (4) State Key Laboratory of Disaster Reduction in Civil Engineering, Tongji University, Shanghai, China)
Abstract: System identification is normally involved in augmenting time series data by time shifting and nonlinearisation (via polynomial basis), which introduce redundancy both feature-wise and sample-wise. Many research works focus on reducing redundancy feature-wise, while less attention is paid to sample-wise redundancy. This paper proposes a novel data pruning method, called (mini-batch) FastCan, to reduce sample-wise redundancy based on dictionary learning. Time series data is represented by some representative samples, called atoms, via dictionary learning. The useful samples are selected based on their correlation with the atoms. The method is tested on one simulated dataset and two benchmark datasets. The R-squared between the coefficients of models trained on the full and the coefficients of models trained on pruned datasets is adopted to evaluate the performance of data pruning methods. It is found that the proposed method significantly outperforms the random pruning method.

Title: How to Divide: A Set Partitioning Strategy Balancing the Trade-off Between Intra-Subset Correlation and Inter-Subset Gain Mutual Influence in Distributed Attack Detection Scheduling Task
Authors: Yuhan Suo, Runqi Chai, Senchun Chai, Zhong-Hua Pang, Jiping Xu, Yuanqing Xia
Abstract: Recently, the efficiency of attack detection in large-scale sensor networks has remained a critical research challenge. Studies have shown that while distributed algorithms offer higher efficiency compared to centralized approaches, they often come at the cost of reduced performance. To strike a balance between detection efficiency and performance in large-scale sensor networks, this paper explores the feasibility of extending existing algorithms to a distributed framework. Starting from the perspective of set partitioning strategies, this study analyzes the key factor that contributes to the performance differences between distributed and centralized algorithms. By examining the gain mutual influence of sensor subsets, an optimal set partitioning strategy is designed to minimize inter-subset mutual influence while enhancing intra-subset correlation. To further reduce the computational cost of gain updates, a suboptimal partitioning strategy based on Grassmann distance is proposed, improving the efficiency of selecting suspicious sensors. Theoretical analysis demonstrates that this approach effectively reduces the computational cost of gain updates while maintaining detection performance. Finally, simulation results validate the effectiveness of the proposed method in enhancing attack detection performance.

Title: Parallel-in-Time Kalman Smoothing Using Orthogonal Transformations
Authors: Shahaf Gargir, Sivan Toledo
Abstract: We present a numerically-stable parallel-in-time linear Kalman smoother. The smoother uses a novel highly-parallel QR factorization for a class of structured sparse matrices for state estimation, and an adaptation of the SelInv selective-inversion algorithm to evaluate the covariance matrices of estimated states. Our implementation of the new algorithm, using the Threading Building Blocks (TBB) library, scales well on both Intel and ARM multi-core servers, achieving speedups of up to 47x on 64 cores. The algorithm performs more arithmetic than sequential smoothers; consequently it is 1.8x to 2.5x slower on a single core. The new algorithm is faster and scales better than the parallel Kalman smoother proposed by Särkkä and Garc\'ıa-Fernández in 2021.

Title: Matrix Low-dimensional Qubit Casting Based Quantum Electromagnetic Transient Network Simulation Program
Authors: Qi Lou, Yijun Xu, Wei Gu
Abstract: In modern power systems, the integration of converter-interfaced generations requires the development of electromagnetic transient network simulation programs (EMTP) that can capture rapid fluctuations. However, as the power system scales, the EMTP's computing complexity increases exponentially, leading to a curse of dimensionality that hinders its practical application. Facing this challenge, quantum computing offers a promising approach for achieving exponential acceleration. To realize this in noisy intermediate-scale quantum computers, the variational quantum linear solution (VQLS) was advocated because of its robustness against depolarizing noise. However, it suffers data inflation issues in its preprocessing phase, and no prior research has applied quantum computing to high-frequency switching EMT this http URL address these issues, this paper first designs the matrix low-dimension qubit casting (MLQC) method to address the data inflation problem in the preprocessing of the admittance matrix for VQLS in EMT networks. Besides, we propose a real-only quantum circuit reduction method tailored to the characteristics of the EMT network admittance matrices. Finally, the proposed quantum EMTP algorithm (QEMTP) has been successfully verified for EMT networks containing a large number of high-frequency switching elements.

Title: On Data-Driven Robust Optimization With Multiple Uncertainty Subsets: Unified Uncertainty Set Representation and Mitigating Conservatism
Authors: Yun Li, Neil Yorke-Smith, Tamas Keviczky
Abstract: Constructing uncertainty sets as unions of multiple subsets has emerged as an effective approach for creating compact and flexible uncertainty representations in data-driven robust optimization (RO). This paper focuses on two separate research questions. The first concerns the computational challenge in applying these uncertainty sets in RO-based predictive control. To address this, a monolithic mixed-integer representation of the uncertainty set is proposed to uniformly describe the union of multiple subsets, enabling the computation of the worst-case uncertainty scenario across all subsets within a single mixed-integer linear programming (MILP) problem. The second research question focuses on mitigating the conservatism of conventional RO formulations by leveraging the structure of the uncertainty set. To achieve this, a novel objective function is proposed to exploit the uncertainty set structure and integrate the existing RO and distributionally robust optimization (DRO) formulations, yielding less conservative solutions than conventional RO formulations while avoiding the high-dimensional continuous uncertainty distributions and incurring high computational burden typically associated with existing DRO formulations. Given the proposed formulations, numerically efficient computation methods based on column-and-constraint generation (CCG) are also developed. Extensive simulations across three case studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed schemes.

Authors: Michele Grimaldi, Patryk Cieslak, Eduardo Ochoa, Vibhav Bharti, Hayat Rajani, Ignacio Carlucho, Maria Koskinopoulou, Yvan R. Petillot, Nuno Gracias
Abstract: Simulations are highly valuable in marine robotics, offering a cost-effective and controlled environment for testing in the challenging conditions of underwater and surface operations. Given the high costs and logistical difficulties of real-world trials, simulators capable of capturing the operational conditions of subsea environments have become key in developing and refining algorithms for remotely-operated and autonomous underwater vehicles. This paper highlights recent enhancements to the Stonefish simulator, an advanced open-source platform supporting development and testing of marine robotics solutions. Key updates include a suite of additional sensors, such as an event-based camera, a thermal camera, and an optical flow camera, as well as, visual light communication, support for tethered operations, improved thruster modelling, more flexible hydrodynamics, and enhanced sonar accuracy. These developments and an automated annotation tool significantly bolster Stonefish's role in marine robotics research, especially in the field of machine learning, where training data with a known ground truth is hard or impossible to collect.

Abstract: Real-time speech interaction, serving as a fundamental interface for human-machine collaboration, holds immense potential. However, current open-source models face limitations such as high costs in voice data collection, weakness in dynamic control, and limited intelligence. To address these challenges, this paper introduces Step-Audio, the first production-ready open-source solution. Key contributions include: 1) a 130B-parameter unified speech-text multi-modal model that achieves unified understanding and generation, with the Step-Audio-Chat version open-sourced; 2) a generative speech data engine that establishes an affordable voice cloning framework and produces the open-sourced lightweight Step-Audio-TTS-3B model through distillation; 3) an instruction-driven fine control system enabling dynamic adjustments across dialects, emotions, singing, and RAP; 4) an enhanced cognitive architecture augmented with tool calling and role-playing abilities to manage complex tasks effectively. Based on our new StepEval-Audio-360 evaluation benchmark, Step-Audio achieves state-of-the-art performance in human evaluations, especially in terms of instruction following. On open-source benchmarks like LLaMA Question, shows 9.3% average performance improvement, demonstrating our commitment to advancing the development of open-source multi-modal language technologies.

Title: Design Considerations Based on Stability for a Class of TCP Algorithms
Authors: Sreekanth Prabhakar, Gaurav Raina
Abstract: Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) continues to be the dominant transport protocol on the Internet. The stability of fluid models has been a key consideration in the design of TCP and the performance evaluation of TCP algorithms. Based on local stability analysis, we formulate some design considerations for a class of TCP algorithms. We begin with deriving sufficient conditions for the local stability of a generalized TCP algorithm in the presence of heterogeneous round-trip delays. Within this generalized model, we consider three specific variants of TCP: TCP Reno, Compound TCP, and Scalable TCP. The sufficient conditions we derive are scalable across network topologies with one, two, and many bottleneck links. We are interested in networks with intermediate and small drop-tail buffers as they offer smaller queuing delays. The small buffer regime is more attractive as the conditions for stability are decentralized. TCP algorithms that follow our design considerations can provide stable operation on any network topology, irrespective of the number of bottleneck links or delays in the network.

Title: NaturalL2S: End-to-End High-quality Multispeaker Lip-to-Speech Synthesis with Differential Digital Signal Processing
Authors: Yifan Liang, Fangkun Liu, Andong Li, Xiaodong Li, Chengshi Zheng
Abstract: Recent advancements in visual speech recognition (VSR) have promoted progress in lip-to-speech synthesis, where pre-trained VSR models enhance the intelligibility of synthesized speech by providing valuable semantic information. The success achieved by cascade frameworks, which combine pseudo-VSR with pseudo-text-to-speech (TTS) or implicitly utilize the transcribed text, highlights the benefits of leveraging VSR models. However, these methods typically rely on mel-spectrograms as an intermediate representation, which may introduce a key bottleneck: the domain gap between synthetic mel-spectrograms, generated from inherently error-prone lip-to-speech mappings, and real mel-spectrograms used to train vocoders. This mismatch inevitably degrades synthesis quality. To bridge this gap, we propose Natural Lip-to-Speech (NaturalL2S), an end-to-end framework integrating acoustic inductive biases with differentiable speech generation components. Specifically, we introduce a fundamental frequency (F0) predictor to capture prosodic variations in synthesized speech. The predicted F0 then drives a Differentiable Digital Signal Processing (DDSP) synthesizer to generate a coarse signal which serves as prior information for subsequent speech synthesis. Additionally, instead of relying on a reference speaker embedding as an auxiliary input, our approach achieves satisfactory performance on speaker similarity without explicitly modelling speaker characteristics. Both objective and subjective evaluation results demonstrate that NaturalL2S can effectively enhance the quality of the synthesized speech when compared to state-of-the-art methods.

Title: Feasibility Evaluation of Quadratic Programs for Constrained Control
Authors: Panagiotis Rousseas, Dimitra Panagou
Abstract: This paper presents a computationally-efficient method for evaluating the feasibility of Quadratic Programs (QPs) for online constrained control. Based on the duality principle, we first show that the feasibility of a QP can be determined by the solution of a properly-defined Linear Program (LP). Our analysis yields a LP that can be solved more efficiently compared to the original QP problem, and more importantly, is simpler in form and can be solved more efficiently compared to existing methods that assess feasibility via LPs. The computational efficiency of the proposed method compared to existing methods for feasibility evaluation is demonstrated in comparative case studies as well as a feasible-constraint selection problem, indicating its promise for online feasibility evaluation of optimization-based controllers.

Title: Robotic CBCT Meets Robotic Ultrasound
Authors: Feng Li, Yuan Bi, Dianye Huang, Zhongliang Jiang, Nassir Navab
Abstract: The multi-modality imaging system offers optimal fused images for safe and precise interventions in modern clinical practices, such as computed tomography - ultrasound (CT-US) guidance for needle insertion. However, the limited dexterity and mobility of current imaging devices hinder their integration into standardized workflows and the advancement toward fully autonomous intervention systems. In this paper, we present a novel clinical setup where robotic cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) and robotic US are pre-calibrated and dynamically co-registered, enabling new clinical applications. This setup allows registration-free rigid registration, facilitating multi-modal guided procedures in the absence of tissue deformation. First, a one-time pre-calibration is performed between the systems. To ensure a safe insertion path by highlighting critical vasculature on the 3D CBCT, SAM2 segments vessels from B-mode images, using the Doppler signal as an autonomously generated prompt. Based on the registration, the Doppler image or segmented vessel masks are then mapped onto the CBCT, creating an optimally fused image with comprehensive detail. To validate the system, we used a specially designed phantom, featuring lesions covered by ribs and multiple vessels with simulated moving flow. The mapping error between US and CBCT resulted in an average deviation of 1.72+-0.62 mm. A user study demonstrated the effectiveness of CBCT-US fusion for needle insertion guidance, showing significant improvements in time efficiency, accuracy, and success rate. Needle intervention performance improved by approximately 50% compared to the conventional US-guided workflow. We present the first robotic dual-modality imaging system designed to guide clinical applications. The results show significant performance improvements compared to traditional manual interventions.

Title: Token Communications: A Unified Framework for Cross-modal Context-aware Semantic Communications
Authors: Li Qiao, Mahdi Boloursaz Mashhadi, Zhen Gao, Rahim Tafazolli, Mehdi Bennis, Dusit Niyato
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce token communications (TokCom), a unified framework to leverage cross-modal context information in generative semantic communications (GenSC). TokCom is a new paradigm, motivated by the recent success of generative foundation models and multimodal large language models (GFM/MLLMs), where the communication units are tokens, enabling efficient transformer-based token processing at the transmitter and receiver. In this paper, we introduce the potential opportunities and challenges of leveraging context in GenSC, explore how to integrate GFM/MLLMs-based token processing into semantic communication systems to leverage cross-modal context effectively, present the key principles for efficient TokCom at various layers in future wireless networks. We demonstrate the corresponding TokCom benefits in a GenSC setup for image, leveraging cross-modal context information, which increases the bandwidth efficiency by 70.8% with negligible loss of semantic/perceptual quality. Finally, the potential research directions are identified to facilitate adoption of TokCom in future wireless networks.

Title: VoLUT: Efficient Volumetric streaming enhanced by LUT-based super-resolution
Authors: Chendong Wang, Anlan Zhang, Yifan Yang, Lili Qiu, Yuqing Yang, Xinyang Jiang, Feng Qian, Suman Banerjee
Abstract: 3D volumetric video provides immersive experience and is gaining traction in digital media. Despite its rising popularity, the streaming of volumetric video content poses significant challenges due to the high data bandwidth requirement. A natural approach to mitigate the bandwidth issue is to reduce the volumetric video's data rate by downsampling the content prior to transmission. The video can then be upsampled at the receiver's end using a super-resolution (SR) algorithm to reconstruct the high-resolution details. While super-resolution techniques have been extensively explored and advanced for 2D video content, there is limited work on SR algorithms tailored for volumetric videos. To address this gap and the growing need for efficient volumetric video streaming, we have developed VoLUT with a new SR algorithm specifically designed for volumetric content. Our algorithm uniquely harnesses the power of lookup tables (LUTs) to facilitate the efficient and accurate upscaling of low-resolution volumetric data. The use of LUTs enables our algorithm to quickly reference precomputed high-resolution values, thereby significantly reducing the computational complexity and time required for upscaling. We further apply adaptive video bit rate algorithm (ABR) to dynamically determine the downsampling rate according to the network condition and stream the selected video rate to the receiver. Compared to related work, VoLUT is the first to enable high-quality 3D SR on commodity mobile devices at line-rate. Our evaluation shows VoLUT can reduce bandwidth usage by 70% , boost QoE by 36.7% for volumetric video streaming and achieve 3D SR speed-up with no quality compromise.

Title: Wearable-based Fair and Accurate Pain Assessment Using Multi-Attribute Fairness Loss in Convolutional Neural Networks
Authors: Yidong Zhu, Shao-Hsien Liu, Mohammad Arif Ul Alam
Abstract: The integration of diverse health data, such as IoT (Internet of Things), EHR (Electronic Health Record), and clinical surveys, with scalable AI(Artificial Intelligence) has enabled the identification of physical, behavioral, and psycho-social indicators of pain. However, the adoption of AI in clinical pain evaluation is hindered by challenges like personalization and fairness. Many AI models, including machine and deep learning, exhibit biases, discriminating against specific groups based on gender or ethnicity, causing skepticism among medical professionals about their reliability. This paper proposes a Multi-attribute Fairness Loss (MAFL) based Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model designed to account for protected attributes in data, ensuring fair pain status predictions while minimizing disparities between privileged and unprivileged groups. We evaluate whether a balance between accuracy and fairness is achievable by comparing the proposed model with existing mitigation methods. Our findings indicate that the model performs favorably against state-of-the-art techniques. Using the NIH All-Of-US dataset, comprising data from 868 individuals over 1500 days, we demonstrate our model's effectiveness, achieving accuracy rates between 75% and 85%.

Title: A Multiobjective Reinforcement Learning Framework for Microgrid Energy Management
Authors: M. Vivienne Liu, Patrick M. Reed, David Gold, Garret Quist, C. Lindsay Anderson
Abstract: The emergence of microgrids (MGs) has provided a promising solution for decarbonizing and decentralizing the power grid, mitigating the challenges posed by climate change. However, MG operations often involve considering multiple objectives that represent the interests of different stakeholders, leading to potentially complex conflicts. To tackle this issue, we propose a novel multi-objective reinforcement learning framework that explores the high-dimensional objective space and uncovers the tradeoffs between conflicting objectives. This framework leverages exogenous information and capitalizes on the data-driven nature of reinforcement learning, enabling the training of a parametric policy without the need for long-term forecasts or knowledge of the underlying uncertainty distribution. The trained policies exhibit diverse, adaptive, and coordinative behaviors with the added benefit of providing interpretable insights on the dynamics of their information use. We employ this framework on the Cornell University MG (CU-MG), which is a combined heat and power MG, to evaluate its effectiveness. The results demonstrate performance improvements in all objectives considered compared to the status quo operations and offer more flexibility in navigating complex operational tradeoffs.

Title: On undesired emergent behaviors in compound prostate cancer detection systems
Authors: Erlend Sortland Rolfsnes, Philip Thangngat, Trygve Eftestøl, Tobias Nordström, Fredrik Jäderling, Martin Eklund, Alvaro Fernandez-Quilez
Abstract: Artificial intelligence systems show promise to aid in the di- agnostic pathway of prostate cancer (PC), by supporting radiologists in interpreting magnetic resonance images (MRI) of the prostate. Most MRI-based systems are designed to detect clinically significant PC le- sions, with the main objective of preventing over-diagnosis. Typically, these systems involve an automatic prostate segmentation component and a clinically significant PC lesion detection component. In spite of the compound nature of the systems, evaluations are presented assum- ing a standalone clinically significant PC detection component. That is, they are evaluated in an idealized scenario and under the assumption that a highly accurate prostate segmentation is available at test time. In this work, we aim to evaluate a clinically significant PC lesion de- tection system accounting for its compound nature. For that purpose, we simulate a realistic deployment scenario and evaluate the effect of two non-ideal and previously validated prostate segmentation modules on the PC detection ability of the compound system. Following, we com- pare them with an idealized setting, where prostate segmentations are assumed to have no faults. We observe significant differences in the de- tection ability of the compound system in a realistic scenario and in the presence of the highest-performing prostate segmentation module (DSC: 90.07+-0.74), when compared to the idealized one (AUC: 77.93 +- 3.06 and 84.30+- 4.07, P<.001). Our results depict the relevance of holistic evalu- ations for PC detection compound systems, where interactions between system components can lead to decreased performance and degradation at deployment time.

Title: Superposition theorem for flexible grids
Authors: Antoine Marot, Noureddine Henka, Benjamin Donnot, Sami Tazi
Abstract: Flexible grid topology has become a key enabler of flexibility in modern power grids, particularly for congestion management. Studying the effects of combinatorial topological changes is therefore of significant interest, though it remains computationally intensive in most cases. To address this, we revisit the superposition theorem, which has served as the foundation for the decomposition of numerous power system problems over the past decades, particularly those involving changes in generation and loads. However, its application has traditionally been restricted to fixed grid topologies, breaking down as soon as a topology change occurs. In this paper, we extend the superposition theorem to accommodate varying grid topologies by leveraging well-known distribution factors. This unified framework applies to all types of topological changes, including line disconnection and reconnection, as well as bus splitting and merging. We provide numerical experiments to validate our approach and highlight its advantages in terms of speed-up and interpretability. Finally, we demonstrate its application in two key use cases: remedial action search and updated security analysis following a topological change. Our results show that the proposed approach achieves more than an order-of-magnitude speed-up for real-sized grids compared to the fastest power flow solvers.

Title: High-Performance Distributed Control for Large-Scale Linear Systems: A Partitioned Distributed Observer Approach
Authors: Haotian Xu, Shuai Liu, Ling Shi
Abstract: In recent years, the distributed-observer-based distributed control law has shown powerful ability to arbitrarily approximate the centralized control performance. However, the traditional distributed observer requires each local observer to reconstruct the state information of the whole system, which is unrealistic for large-scale scenarios. To fill this gap, this paper develops a greedy-idea-based large-scale system partition algorithm, which can significantly reduce the dimension of local observers. Then, the partitioned distributed observer for large-scale systems is proposed to overcome the problem that the system dynamics are difficult to estimate due to the coupling between partitions. Furthermore, the two-layer Lyapunov analysis method is adopted and the dynamic transformation lemma of compact errors is proven, which solves the problem of analyzing stability of the error dynamic of the partitioned distributed observer. Finally, it is proved that the distributed control law based on the partitioned distributed observer can also arbitrarily approximate the control performance of the centralized control law, and the dimension of the local observer is greatly reduced compared with the traditional method. The simulation results show that when the similarity between the physical network and the communication network is about 80%, the local observer dimension is greatly reduced by 90% and the relative error between the performance of the distributed control law and that of the centralized control law is less than 1%.

Title: Joint enhancement of automatic chest X-ray diagnosis and radiological gaze prediction with multi-stage cooperative learning
Authors: Zirui Qiu, Hassan Rivaz, Yiming Xiao
Abstract: Purpose: As visual inspection is an inherent process during radiological screening, the associated eye gaze data can provide valuable insights into relevant clinical decisions. As deep learning has become the state-of-the-art for computer-assisted diagnosis, integrating human behavior, such as eye gaze data, into these systems is instrumental to help align machine predictions with clinical diagnostic criteria, thus enhancing the quality of automatic radiological diagnosis. Methods: We propose a novel deep learning framework for joint disease diagnosis and prediction of corresponding clinical visual attention maps for chest X-ray scans. Specifically, we introduce a new dual-encoder multi-task UNet, which leverages both a DenseNet201 backbone and a Residual and Squeeze-and-Excitation block-based encoder to extract diverse features for visual attention map prediction, and a multi-scale feature-fusion classifier to perform disease classification. To tackle the issue of asynchronous training schedules of individual tasks in multi-task learning, we proposed a multi-stage cooperative learning strategy, with contrastive learning for feature encoder pretraining to boost performance. Results: Our proposed method is shown to significantly outperform existing techniques for chest X-ray diagnosis (AUC=0.93) and the quality of visual attention map prediction (Correlation coefficient=0.58). Conclusion: Benefiting from the proposed multi-task multi-stage cooperative learning, our technique demonstrates the benefit of integrating clinicians' eye gaze into clinical AI systems to boost performance and potentially explainability.

Title: Differentially Private Dual Gradient Tracking for Distributed Resource Allocation
Authors: Wei Huo, Xiaomeng Chen, Lingying Huang, Karl Henrik Johansson, Ling Shi
Abstract: This paper investigates privacy issues in distributed resource allocation over directed networks, where each agent holds a private cost function and optimizes its decision subject to a global coupling constraint through local interaction with other agents. Conventional methods for resource allocation over directed networks require all agents to transmit their original data to neighbors, which poses the risk of disclosing sensitive and private information. To address this issue, we propose an algorithm called differentially private dual gradient tracking (DP-DGT) for distributed resource allocation, which obfuscates the exchanged messages using independent Laplacian noise. Our algorithm ensures that the agents' decisions converge to a neighborhood of the optimal solution almost surely. Furthermore, without the assumption of bounded gradients, we prove that the cumulative differential privacy loss under the proposed algorithm is finite even when the number of iterations goes to infinity. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to simultaneously achieve these two goals in distributed resource allocation problems over directed networks. Finally, numerical simulations on economic dispatch problems within the IEEE 14-bus system illustrate the effectiveness of our proposed algorithm.

Title: Lyapunov-Based Deep Residual Neural Network (ResNet) Adaptive Control
Authors: Omkar Sudhir Patil, Duc M. Le, Emily J. Griffis, Warren E. Dixon
Abstract: Deep Neural Network (DNN)-based controllers have emerged as a tool to compensate for unstructured uncertainties in nonlinear dynamical systems. A recent breakthrough in the adaptive control literature provides a Lyapunov-based approach to derive weight adaptation laws for each layer of a fully-connected feedforward DNN-based adaptive controller. However, deriving weight adaptation laws from a Lyapunov-based analysis remains an open problem for deep residual neural networks (ResNets). This paper provides the first result on Lyapunov-derived weight adaptation for a ResNet-based adaptive controller. A nonsmooth Lyapunov-based analysis is provided to guarantee asymptotic tracking error convergence. Comparative Monte Carlo simulations are provided to demonstrate the performance of the developed ResNet-based adaptive controller. The ResNet-based adaptive controller shows a 64% improvement in the tracking and function approximation performance, in comparison to a fully-connected DNN-based adaptive controller.

Title: Robust and tractable multidimensional exponential analysis
Authors: H. N. Mhaskar, S. Kitimoon, Raghu G. Raj
Abstract: Motivated by a number of applications in signal processing, we study the following question. Given samples of a multidimensional signal of the form \begin{align*} f(\bs\ell)=\sum_{k=1}^K a_k\exp(-i\langle \bs\ell, \w_k\rangle), \\ \w_1,\cdots,\w_k\in\mathbb{R}^q, \ \bs\ell\in \ZZ^q, \ |\bs\ell| <n, \end{align*} determine the values of the number $K$ of components, and the parameters $a_k$ and $\w_k$'s. We develop an algorithm to recuperate these quantities accurately using only a subsample of size $Ø(qn)$ of this data. For this purpose, we use a novel localized kernel method to identify the parameters, including the number $K$ of signals. Our method is easy to implement, and is shown to be stable under a very low SNR range. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our resulting algorithm using 2 and 3 dimensional examples from the literature, and show substantial improvements over state-of-the-art techniques including Prony based, MUSIC and ESPRIT approaches.

Title: Multi-Layer Network Formation through HAPS Base Station and Transmissive RIS-Equipped UAV
Authors: Faical Khennoufa, Khelil Abdellatif, Halim Yanikomeroglu, Metin Ozturk, Taissir Elganimi, Ferdi Kara, Khaled Rabie
Abstract: In order to bolster future wireless networks, there has been a great deal of interest in non-terrestrial networks, especially aerial platforms including high-altitude platform stations (HAPS) and uncrewed aerial vehicles (UAVs). These platforms can integrate advanced technologies such as reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA). In this regard, this paper proposes a multi-layer network architecture consisting of HAPS and UAV, where the former acts as a HAPS super macro base station (HAPS-SMBS), while the latter serves as a relay node for the ground Internet of Things (IoT) devices. The UAV is equipped with active transmissive RIS, which is a novel technology with promising benefits. We also utilize multiple-input single-output (MISO) technology, i.e., multiple antennas at the HAPS-SMBS and a single antenna at the IoT devices. Additionally, we consider NOMA as the multiple access technology as well as the existence of hardware impairments as a practical limitation. We compare the proposed system model with various scenarios, all involving the HAPS-SMBS and RIS-equipped UAV relay combination, but with different types of RIS, antenna configurations, and access technologies. Sum rate and energy efficiency are used as performance metrics, and the findings demonstrate that, in comparison to all benchmarks, the proposed system yields significant performance gains. Moreover, hardware impairment limits the system performance at high transmit power levels.

Title: Reserve Provision from Electric Vehicles: Aggregate Boundaries and Stochastic Model Predictive Control
Authors: Jacob Thrän, Jakub Mareček, Robert N. Shorten, Timothy C. Green
Abstract: Controlled charging of electric vehicles, EVs, is a major potential source of flexibility to facilitate the integration of variable renewable energy and reduce the need for stationary energy storage. To offer system services from EVs, fleet aggregators must address the uncertainty of individual driving and charging behaviour. This paper introduces a means of forecasting the service volume available from EVs by considering several EV batteries as one conceptual battery with aggregate power and energy boundaries. Aggregation avoids the difficult prediction of individual driving behaviour. The predictability of the boundaries is demonstrated using a multiple linear regression model which achieves a normalised root mean square error of 20% - 40% for a fleet of 1,000 EVs. A two-stage stochastic model predictive control algorithm is used to schedule reserve services on a day-ahead basis addressing risk trade-offs by including Conditional Value-at-Risk in the objective function. A case study with 1.2 million domestic EV charge records from Great Britain illustrates that increasing fleet size improves prediction accuracy, thereby increasing reserve revenues and decreasing an aggregator's operational costs. For fleet sizes of 400 or above, cost reductions plateau at 60% compared to uncontrolled charging, with an average of 1.8kW of reserve provided per vehicle.

Title: Real-time Deformation Correction in Additively Printed Flexible Antenna Arrays

Abstract: Conformal phased arrays provide multiple degrees of freedom to the scan angle, which is typically limited by antenna aperture in rigid arrays. Silicon-based RF signal processing offers reliable, reconfigurable, multi-functional, and compact control for conformal phased arrays that can be used for on-the-move communication. While the lightweight, compactness, and shape-changing properties of the conformal phased arrays are attractive, these features result in dynamic deformation of the array during motion leading to significant dynamic beam pointing errors. We propose a silicon-based, compact, reconfigurable solution to self-correct these dynamic deformation-induced beam pointing errors. Furthermore, additive printing is leveraged to enhance the flexibility of the conformal phased arrays, as the printed conductive ink is more flexible than bulk copper and can be easily deposited on flexible sheets using different printing tools, providing an environmentally-friendly solution for large-scale production. The inks such as conventional silver inks are expensive and copper-based printable inks suffer from spontaneous metal oxidation that alters trace impedance and degrades beamforming performance. This work uses a low-cost molecular copper decomposition ink with reliable RF properties at different temperature and strain to print the proposed intelligent conformal phased array operating at 2.1 GHz. Proof-of-concept prototype $2\times2$ array self-corrects the deformation induces beampointing error with an error $<1.25^\circ$. The silicon based array processing part occupying only 2.58 mm$^2$ area and 83 mW power per tile.

Title: Object-Attribute-Relation Representation Based Video Semantic Communication
Authors: Qiyuan Du, Yiping Duan, Qianqian Yang, Xiaoming Tao, Mérouane Debbah
Abstract: With the rapid growth of multimedia data volume, there is an increasing need for efficient video transmission in applications such as virtual reality and future video streaming services. Semantic communication is emerging as a vital technique for ensuring efficient and reliable transmission in low-bandwidth, high-noise settings. However, most current approaches focus on joint source-channel coding (JSCC) that depends on end-to-end training. These methods often lack an interpretable semantic representation and struggle with adaptability to various downstream tasks. In this paper, we introduce the use of object-attribute-relation (OAR) as a semantic framework for videos to facilitate low bit-rate coding and enhance the JSCC process for more effective video transmission. We utilize OAR sequences for both low bit-rate representation and generative video reconstruction. Additionally, we incorporate OAR into the image JSCC model to prioritize communication resources for areas more critical to downstream tasks. Our experiments on traffic surveillance video datasets assess the effectiveness of our approach in terms of video transmission performance. The empirical findings demonstrate that our OAR-based video coding method not only outperforms H.265 coding at lower bit-rates but also synergizes with JSCC to deliver robust and efficient video transmission.

Title: DiTTo-TTS: Diffusion Transformers for Scalable Text-to-Speech without Domain-Specific Factors
Authors: Keon Lee, Dong Won Kim, Jaehyeon Kim, Seungjun Chung, Jaewoong Cho
Abstract: Large-scale latent diffusion models (LDMs) excel in content generation across various modalities, but their reliance on phonemes and durations in text-to-speech (TTS) limits scalability and access from other fields. While recent studies show potential in removing these domain-specific factors, performance remains suboptimal. In this work, we introduce DiTTo-TTS, a Diffusion Transformer (DiT)-based TTS model, to investigate whether LDM-based TTS can achieve state-of-the-art performance without domain-specific factors. Through rigorous analysis and empirical exploration, we find that (1) DiT with minimal modifications outperforms U-Net, (2) variable-length modeling with a speech length predictor significantly improves results over fixed-length approaches, and (3) conditions like semantic alignment in speech latent representations are key to further enhancement. By scaling our training data to 82K hours and the model size to 790M parameters, we achieve superior or comparable zero-shot performance to state-of-the-art TTS models in naturalness, intelligibility, and speaker similarity, all without relying on domain-specific factors.

Title: Wideband Relative Transfer Function (RTF) Estimation Exploiting Frequency Correlations
Authors: Giovanni Bologni, Richard C. Hendriks, Richard Heusdens
Abstract: This article focuses on estimating relative transfer functions (RTFs) for beamforming applications. Traditional methods often assume that spectra are uncorrelated, an assumption that is often violated in practical scenarios due to factors such as time-domain windowing or the non-stationary nature of signals, as observed in speech. To overcome these limitations, we propose an RTF estimation technique that leverages spectral and spatial correlations through subspace analysis. Additionally, we derive Cramér--Rao bounds (CRBs) for the RTF estimation task, providing theoretical insights into the achievable estimation accuracy. These bounds reveal that channel estimation can be performed more accurately if the noise or the target signal exhibits spectral correlations. Experiments with both real and synthetic data show that our technique outperforms the narrowband maximum-likelihood estimator, known as covariance whitening (CW), when the target exhibits spectral correlations. Although the proposed algorithm generally achieves accuracy close to the theoretical bound, there is potential for further improvement, especially in scenarios with highly spectrally correlated noise. While channel estimation has various applications, we demonstrate the method using a minimum variance distortionless (MVDR) beamformer for multichannel speech enhancement. A free Python implementation is also provided.

Title: Machine Learning for Equitable Load Shedding: Real-time Solution via Learning Binding Constraints
Authors: Yuqi Zhou, Joseph Severino, Sanjana Vijayshankar, Juliette Ugirumurera, Jibo Sanyal
Abstract: Timely and effective load shedding in power systems is critical for maintaining supply-demand balance and preventing cascading blackouts. To eliminate load shedding bias against specific regions in the system, optimization-based methods are uniquely positioned to help balance between economical and equity considerations. However, the resulting optimization problem involves complex constraints, which can be time-consuming to solve and thus cannot meet the real-time requirements of load shedding. To tackle this challenge, in this paper we present an efficient machine learning algorithm to enable millisecond-level computation for the optimization-based load shedding problem. Numerical studies on both a 3-bus toy example and a realistic RTS-GMLC system have demonstrated the validity and efficiency of the proposed algorithm for delivering equitable and real-time load shedding decisions.

Title: Certifiable Reachability Learning Using a New Lipschitz Continuous Value Function
Authors: Jingqi Li, Donggun Lee, Jaewon Lee, Kris Shengjun Dong, Somayeh Sojoudi, Claire Tomlin
Abstract: We propose a new reachability learning framework for high-dimensional nonlinear systems, focusing on reach-avoid problems. These problems require computing the reach-avoid set, which ensures that all its elements can safely reach a target set despite disturbances within pre-specified bounds. Our framework has two main parts: offline learning of a newly designed reachavoid value function, and post-learning certification. Compared to prior work, our new value function is Lipschitz continuous and its associated Bellman operator is a contraction mapping, both of which improve the learning performance. To ensure deterministic guarantees of our learned reach-avoid set, we introduce two efficient post-learning certification methods. Both methods can be used online for real-time local certification or offline for comprehensive certification. We validate our framework in a 12-dimensional crazyflie drone racing hardware experiment and a simulated 10-dimensional highway take-over example.

Title: ResSR: A Computationally Efficient Residual Approach to Super-Resolving Multispectral Images
Authors: Haley Duba-Sullivan, Emma J. Reid, Sophie Voisin, Charles A. Bouman, Gregery T. Buzzard
Abstract: Multispectral imaging sensors typically have wavelength-dependent resolution, which limits downstream processing. Consequently, researchers have proposed multispectral image super-resolution (MSI-SR) methods which upsample low-resolution bands to achieve a common resolution across all wavelengths. However, existing MSI-SR methods are computationally expensive because they require spatially regularized deconvolution and/or training-based methods. In this paper, we introduce ResSR, a computationally efficient MSI-SR method that achieves high-quality reconstructions by using spectral decomposition along with spatial residual correction. ResSR applies singular value decomposition to identify correlations across spectral bands, uses pixel-wise computation to upsample the MSI, and then applies a residual correction process to correct the high-spatial frequency components of the upsampled bands. While ResSR is formulated as the solution to a spatially-coupled optimization problem, we use pixel-wise regularization and derive an approximate non-iterative solution, resulting in a computationally efficient, non-iterative algorithm. Results on a combination of simulated and measured data show that ResSR is 2$\times$ to 10$\times$ faster than alternative MSI-SR algorithms, while producing comparable or better image quality.

Title: An Analysis of Logit Learning with the r-Lambert Function
Authors: Rory Gavin, Ming Cao, Keith Paarporn
Abstract: The well-known replicator equation in evolutionary game theory describes how population-level behaviors change over time when individuals make decisions using simple imitation learning rules. In this paper, we study evolutionary dynamics based on a fundamentally different class of learning rules known as logit learning. Numerous previous studies on logit dynamics provide numerical evidence of bifurcations of multiple fixed points for several types of games. Our results here provide a more explicit analysis of the logit fixed points and their stability properties for the entire class of two-strategy population games -- by way of the $r$-Lambert function. We find that for Prisoner's Dilemma and anti-coordination games, there is only a single fixed point for all rationality levels. However, coordination games exhibit a pitchfork bifurcation: there is a single fixed point in a low-rationality regime, and three fixed points in a high-rationality regime. We provide an implicit characterization for the level of rationality where this bifurcation occurs. In all cases, the set of logit fixed points converges to the full set of Nash equilibria in the high rationality limit.

Title: Analog Beamforming Aided by Full-Dimension One-Bit Chains
Authors: Lina Liu, Weimin Xiao, Jialing Liu, Zhigang Rong
Abstract: This paper investigates the design of analog beamforming at the receiver in millimeter-wave (mmWave) multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems, aided by full digital chains featuring 1-bit ADCs. We advocate utilizing these full digital chains to facilitate rapid channel estimation and beam acquisition for subsequent communication, even without prior knowledge of the training pilots. To balance energy consumption and implementation costs, we opt for 1-bit ADCs. We propose a two-stage maximum likelihood (ML)-based algorithm to estimate angles of arrival (AoAs) and facilitate the design of analog beamforming to maximize the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). We validate our proposed beamforming schemes in narrowband coherent channels through synthetic testing and in wideband coherent channels, particularly under the 3GPP clustered-delay-line (CDL)-C channel model.

Title: SynthSOD: Developing an Heterogeneous Dataset for Orchestra Music Source Separation
Authors: Jaime Garcia-Martinez, David Diaz-Guerra, Archontis Politis, Tuomas Virtanen, Julio J. Carabias-Orti, Pedro Vera-Candeas
Abstract: Recent advancements in music source separation have significantly progressed, particularly in isolating vocals, drums, and bass elements from mixed tracks. These developments owe much to the creation and use of large-scale, multitrack datasets dedicated to these specific components. However, the challenge of extracting similarly sounding sources from orchestra recordings has not been extensively explored, largely due to a scarcity of comprehensive and clean (i.e bleed-free) multitrack datasets. In this paper, we introduce a novel multitrack dataset called SynthSOD, developed using a set of simulation techniques to create a realistic (i.e. using high-quality soundfonts), musically motivated, and heterogeneous training set comprising different dynamics, natural tempo changes, styles, and conditions. Moreover, we demonstrate the application of a widely used baseline music separation model trained on our synthesized dataset w.r.t to the well-known EnsembleSet, and evaluate its performance under both synthetic and real-world conditions.

Title: Advancements in Electric Vehicle Charging Optimization: A Survey of Reinforcement Learning Approaches
Authors: Mehrshad Shokati, Parisa Mohammadi, Atoosa Amirinian
Abstract: In response to global warming and energy shortages, there has been a significant shift towards integrating renewable energy sources, energy storage systems, and electric vehicles. Deploying electric vehicles within smart grids offers a promising solution to reduce carbon emissions. However, managing the charging and discharging processes of them as distributed power supplies present significant challenges. Additionally, the intermittent nature of renewable energy, uncertainties in electric vehicle-related parameters, fluctuating energy prices, and varying loads make maintaining stable power system operations more complex. Effective management systems for electric vehicle battery charging are crucial to coordinating these processes and ensuring a secure, efficient, and reliable power system. Reinforcement learning, enhanced by deep learning, has gained substantial interest for its model-free approach and real-time optimization, effectively managing electric vehicle charging by maximizing cumulative rewards. This review synthesizes existing literature on reinforcement learning-based frameworks, objectives, and architectures for electric vehicle charging coordination strategies in power systems, classifying methods into centralized and decentralized categories. Additionally, the article offers suggestions for future research directions to further enhance reinforcement learning-based electric vehicle charging optimization.

Title: Electric Grid Topology and Admittance Estimation: Quantifying Phasor-based Measurement Requirements
Authors: Norak Rin, Iman Shames, Ian R. Petersen, Elizabeth L. Ratnam
Abstract: In this paper, we quantify voltage and current phasor-based measurement requirements for the unique estimation of the electric grid topology and admittance parameters. Our approach is underpinned by the concept of a rigidity matrix that has been extensively studied in graph rigidity theory. Specifically, we show that the rank of the rigidity matrix is the same as that of a voltage coefficient matrix in a corresponding electric power system. Accordingly, we show that there is a minimum number of measurements required to uniquely estimate the admittance matrix and corresponding grid topology. By means of a numerical example on the IEEE 4-node radial network, we demonstrate that our approach is suitable for applications in electric power grids.

Title: DINeuro: Distilling Knowledge from 2D Natural Images via Deformable Tubular Transferring Strategy for 3D Neuron Reconstruction
Authors: Yik San Cheng, Runkai Zhao, Heng Wang, Hanchuan Peng, Yui Lo, Yuqian Chen, Lauren J. O'Donnell, Weidong Cai
Abstract: Reconstructing neuron morphology from 3D light microscope imaging data is critical to aid neuroscientists in analyzing brain networks and neuroanatomy. With the boost from deep learning techniques, a variety of learning-based segmentation models have been developed to enhance the signal-to-noise ratio of raw neuron images as a pre-processing step in the reconstruction workflow. However, most existing models directly encode the latent representative features of volumetric neuron data but neglect their intrinsic morphological knowledge. To address this limitation, we design a novel framework that distills the prior knowledge from a 2D Vision Transformer pre-trained on extensive 2D natural images to facilitate neuronal morphological learning of our 3D Vision Transformer. To bridge the knowledge gap between the 2D natural image and 3D microscopic morphologic domains, we propose a deformable tubular transferring strategy that adapts the pre-trained 2D natural knowledge to the inherent tubular characteristics of neuronal structure in the latent embedding space. The experimental results on the Janelia dataset of the BigNeuron project demonstrate that our method achieves a segmentation performance improvement of 4.53% in mean Dice and 3.56% in mean 95% Hausdorff distance.

Title: Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System and Its Application in Road Transportation
Authors: Yuan Li, Tao Li, Xiaoxue Xu, Xiang Dong, Yincai Cai, Ting Peng
Abstract: Numerous real-world systems, including manufacturing processes, supply chains, and robotic systems, involve multiple independent entities with diverse objectives. The potential for conflicts arises from the inability of these entities to accurately predict and anticipate each other's actions. To address this challenge, we propose the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative System (PHCS) framework. By enabling information sharing and collaborative planning among independent entities, the PHCS facilitates the preemptive resolution of potential conflicts. We apply the PHCS framework to the specific context of road transportation, resulting in the Preemptive Holistic Collaborative Road Transportation System (PHCRTS). This system leverages shared driving intentions and pre-planned trajectories to optimize traffic flow and enhance safety. Simulation experiments in a two-lane merging scenario demonstrate the effectiveness of PHCRTS, reducing vehicle time delays by 90%, increasing traffic capacity by 300%, and eliminating accidents. The PHCS framework offers a promising approach to optimize the performance and safety of complex systems with multiple independent entities.

Title: CBraMod: A Criss-Cross Brain Foundation Model for EEG Decoding
Authors: Jiquan Wang, Sha Zhao, Zhiling Luo, Yangxuan Zhou, Haiteng Jiang, Shijian Li, Tao Li, Gang Pan
Abstract: Electroencephalography (EEG) is a non-invasive technique to measure and record brain electrical activity, widely used in various BCI and healthcare applications. Early EEG decoding methods rely on supervised learning, limited by specific tasks and datasets, hindering model performance and generalizability. With the success of large language models, there is a growing body of studies focusing on EEG foundation models. However, these studies still leave challenges: Firstly, most of existing EEG foundation models employ full EEG modeling strategy. It models the spatial and temporal dependencies between all EEG patches together, but ignores that the spatial and temporal dependencies are heterogeneous due to the unique structural characteristics of EEG signals. Secondly, existing EEG foundation models have limited generalizability on a wide range of downstream BCI tasks due to varying formats of EEG data, making it challenging to adapt to. To address these challenges, we propose a novel foundation model called CBraMod. Specifically, we devise a criss-cross transformer as the backbone to thoroughly leverage the structural characteristics of EEG signals, which can model spatial and temporal dependencies separately through two parallel attention mechanisms. And we utilize an asymmetric conditional positional encoding scheme which can encode positional information of EEG patches and be easily adapted to the EEG with diverse formats. CBraMod is pre-trained on a very large corpus of EEG through patch-based masked EEG reconstruction. We evaluate CBraMod on up to 10 downstream BCI tasks (12 public datasets). CBraMod achieves the state-of-the-art performance across the wide range of tasks, proving its strong capability and generalizability. The source code is publicly available at this https URL.

Title: Uncertainty-Aware Critic Augmentation for Hierarchical Multi-Agent EV Charging Control
Authors: Lo Pang-Yun Ting, Ali Şenol, Huan-Yang Wang, Hsu-Chao Lai, Kun-Ta Chuang, Huan Liu
Abstract: The advanced bidirectional EV charging and discharging technology, aimed at supporting grid stability and emergency operations, has driven a growing interest in workplace applications. It not only reduces electricity expenses but also enhances the resilience in handling practical matters, such as peak power limitation, fluctuating energy prices, and unpredictable EV departures. Considering these factors systematically can benefit energy efficiency in office buildings and for EV users simultaneously. To employ AI to address these issues, we propose HUCA, a novel real-time charging control for regulating energy demands for both the building and EVs. HUCA employs hierarchical actor-critic networks to dynamically reduce electricity costs in buildings, accounting for the needs of EV charging in the dynamic pricing scenario. To tackle the uncertain EV departures, we introduce a new critic augmentation to account for departure uncertainties in evaluating the charging decisions, while maintaining the robustness of the charging control. Experiments on real-world electricity datasets under both simulated certain and uncertain departure scenarios demonstrate that HUCA outperforms baselines in terms of total electricity costs while maintaining competitive performance in fulfilling EV charging requirements. A case study also manifests that HUCA effectively balances energy supply between the building and EVs based on real-time information, showcasing its potential as a key AI-driven solution for vehicle charging control.

Abstract: A framework for identifying nonlinear port-Hamiltonian systems using input-state-output data is introduced. The framework utilizes neural networks' universal approximation capacity to effectively represent complex dynamics in a structured way. We show that using the structure helps to make long-term predictions compared to baselines that do not incorporate physics. We also explore different architectures based on MLPs, KANs, and using prior information. The technique is validated through examples featuring nonlinearities in either the skew-symmetric terms, the dissipative terms, or the Hamiltonian.

Title: On Disentangled Training for Nonlinear Transform in Learned Image Compression
Authors: Han Li, Shaohui Li, Wenrui Dai, Maida Cao, Nuowen Kan, Chenglin Li, Junni Zou, Hongkai Xiong
Abstract: Learned image compression (LIC) has demonstrated superior rate-distortion (R-D) performance compared to traditional codecs, but is challenged by training inefficiency that could incur more than two weeks to train a state-of-the-art model from scratch. Existing LIC methods overlook the slow convergence caused by compacting energy in learning nonlinear transforms. In this paper, we first reveal that such energy compaction consists of two components, i.e., feature decorrelation and uneven energy modulation. On such basis, we propose a linear auxiliary transform (AuxT) to disentangle energy compaction in training nonlinear transforms. The proposed AuxT obtains coarse approximation to achieve efficient energy compaction such that distribution fitting with the nonlinear transforms can be simplified to fine details. We then develop wavelet-based linear shortcuts (WLSs) for AuxT that leverages wavelet-based downsampling and orthogonal linear projection for feature decorrelation and subband-aware scaling for

Abstract: In this paper, we propose a new approach to the linear filtering and smoothing problem and demonstrate its applicability to nonlinear filtering. For the linear case, our main theorem provides an explicit expression for the conditional distribution of the hidden process given the observations, leading to a novel derivation of the linear filtering and smoothing equations. Moreover, the theorem offers an efficient framework for computing the asymptotic expansion of nonlinear filtering.

Title: WhiSPA: Semantically and Psychologically Aligned Whisper with Self-Supervised Contrastive and Student-Teacher Learning
Authors: Rajath Rao, Adithya Ganesan, Oscar Kjell, Jonah Luby, Akshay Raghavan, Scott Feltman, Whitney Ringwald, Ryan L. Boyd, Benjamin Luft, Camilo Ruggero, Neville Ryant, Roman Kotov, H. Andrew Schwartz
Abstract: Current speech encoding pipelines often rely on an additional text-based LM to get robust representations of human communication, even though SotA speech-to-text models often have a LM within. This work proposes an approach to improve the LM within an audio model such that the subsequent text-LM is unnecessary. We introduce WhiSPA (Whisper with Semantic and Psychological Alignment), which leverages a novel audio training objective: contrastive loss with a language model embedding as a teacher. Using over 500k speech segments from mental health audio interviews, we evaluate the utility of aligning Whisper's latent space with semantic representations from a text autoencoder (SBERT) and lexically derived embeddings of basic psychological dimensions: emotion and personality. Over self-supervised affective tasks and downstream psychological tasks, WhiSPA surpasses current speech encoders, achieving an average error reduction of 73.4% and 83.8%, respectively. WhiSPA demonstrates that it is not always necessary to run a subsequent text LM on speech-to-text output in order to get a rich psychological representation of human communication.

Title: Integration of Prior Knowledge into Direct Learning for Safe Control of Linear Systems
Authors: Amir Modares, Bahare Kiumarsi, Hamidreza Modares
Abstract: This paper integrates prior knowledge into direct learning of safe controllers for linear uncertain systems under disturbances. To this end, we characterize the set of all closed-loop systems that can be explained by available prior knowledge of the system model and the disturbances. We leverage matrix zonotopes for data-based characterization of closed-loop systems and show that the explainability of closed-loop systems by prior knowledge can be formalized by adding an equality conformity constraint to the matrix zonotope. We then leverage the resulting constraint matrix zonotope and design safe controllers that conform with both data and prior knowledge. This is achieved by ensuring the inclusion of a constrained zonotope of all possible next states in a {\lambda}-scaled level set of the safe set. We consider both polytope and zonotope safe sets and provide set inclusion conditions using linear programming.

Title: End-to-End Learning Framework for Solving Non-Markovian Optimal Control
Authors: Xiaole Zhang, Peiyu Zhang, Xiongye Xiao, Shixuan Li, Vasileios Tzoumas, Vijay Gupta, Paul Bogdan
Abstract: Integer-order calculus often falls short in capturing the long-range dependencies and memory effects found in many real-world processes. Fractional calculus addresses these gaps via fractional-order integrals and derivatives, but fractional-order dynamical systems pose substantial challenges in system identification and optimal control due to the lack of standard control methodologies. In this paper, we theoretically derive the optimal control via linear quadratic regulator (LQR) for fractional-order linear time-invariant (FOLTI) systems and develop an end-to-end deep learning framework based on this theoretical foundation. Our approach establishes a rigorous mathematical model, derives analytical solutions, and incorporates deep learning to achieve data-driven optimal control of FOLTI systems. Our key contributions include: (i) proposing an innovative system identification method control strategy for FOLTI systems, (ii) developing the first end-to-end data-driven learning framework, Fractional-Order Learning for Optimal Control (FOLOC), that learns control policies from observed trajectories, and (iii) deriving a theoretical analysis of sample complexity to quantify the number of samples required for accurate optimal control in complex real-world problems. Experimental results indicate that our method accurately approximates fractional-order system behaviors without relying on Gaussian noise assumptions, pointing to promising avenues for advanced optimal control.

Title: Recent Advances in Discrete Speech Tokens: A Review
Authors: Yiwei Guo, Zhihan Li, Hankun Wang, Bohan Li, Chongtian Shao, Hanglei Zhang, Chenpeng Du, Xie Chen, Shujie Liu, Kai Yu
Abstract: The rapid advancement of speech generation technologies in the era of large language models (LLMs) has established discrete speech tokens as a foundational paradigm for speech representation. These tokens, characterized by their discrete, compact, and concise nature, are not only advantageous for efficient transmission and storage, but also inherently compatible with the language modeling framework, enabling seamless integration of speech into text-dominated LLM architectures. Current research categorizes discrete speech tokens into two principal classes: acoustic tokens and semantic tokens, each of which has evolved into a rich research domain characterized by unique design philosophies and methodological approaches. This survey systematically synthesizes the existing taxonomy and recent innovations in discrete speech tokenization, conducts a critical examination of the strengths and limitations of each paradigm, and presents systematic experimental comparisons across token types. Furthermore, we identify persistent challenges in the field and propose potential research directions, aiming to offer actionable insights to inspire future advancements in the development and application of discrete speech tokens.

Title: LoRa Fine Synchronization with Two-Pass Time and Frequency Offset Estimation
Authors: Joachim Tapparel, Andreas Burg
Abstract: LoRa is currently one of the most widely used low-power wide-area network (LPWAN) technologies. The physical layer leverages a chirp spread spectrum modulation to achieve long-range communication with low power consumption. Synchronization at long distances is a challenging task as the spread signal can lie multiple orders of magnitude below the thermal noise floor. Multiple research works have proposed synchronization algorithms for LoRa under different hardware impairments. However, the impact of sampling frequency offset (SFO) has mostly either been ignored or tracked only during the data phase, but it often harms synchronization. In this work, we extend existing synchronization algorithms for LoRa to estimate and compensate SFO already in the preamble and show that this early compensation has a critical impact on the estimation of other impairments such as carrier frequency offset and sampling time offset. Therefore it is critical to recover long-range signals.

Title: Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation with Content Preserving Perspective: A Review
Authors: Mehran Safayani, Behnaz Mirzapour, Hanieh aghaebrahimiyan, Nasrin Salehi, Hamid Ravaee
Abstract: Image-to-image translation (I2I) transforms an image from a source domain to a target domain while preserving source content. Most computer vision applications are in the field of image-to-image translation, such as style transfer, image segmentation, and photo enhancement. The degree of preservation of the content of the source images in the translation process can be different according to the problem and the intended application. From this point of view, in this paper, we divide the different tasks in the field of image-to-image translation into three categories: Fully Content preserving, Partially Content preserving, and Non-Content preserving. We present different tasks, datasets, methods, results of methods for these three categories in this paper. We make a categorization for I2I methods based on the architecture of different models and study each category separately. In addition, we introduce well-known evaluation criteria in the I2I translation field. Specifically, nearly 70 different I2I models were analyzed, and more than 10 quantitative evaluation metrics and 30 distinct tasks and datasets relevant to the I2I translation problem were both introduced and assessed. Translating from simulation to real images could be well viewed as an application of fully content preserving or partially content preserving unsupervised image-to-image translation methods. So, we provide a benchmark for Sim-to-Real translation, which can be used to evaluate different methods. In general, we conclude that because of the different extent of the obligation to preserving content in various applications, it is better to consider this issue in choosing a suitable I2I model for a specific application.

Title: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access for 6G: Prototypes, Experimental Results and Link/System level Simulations
Authors: Sundar Aditya, Yong Jin Daniel Kim, David Vargas, David Redgate, Onur Dizdar, Neil Bhushan, Xinze Lyu, Sibo Zhang, Stephen Wang, Bruno Clerckx
Abstract: Rate-Splitting Multiple Access (RSMA) is a powerful and versatile physical layer multiple access technique that generalizes and has better interference management capabilities than 5G-based Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA). It is also a rapidly maturing technology, all of which makes it a natural successor to SDMA in 6G. In this article, we describe RSMA's suitability for 6G by presenting: i) link and system level simulations of RSMA's performance gains over SDMA in realistic environments, and (ii) pioneering experimental results that demonstrate RSMA's gains over SDMA for key use cases like enhanced Mobile Broadband (eMBb), and Integrated Sensing and Communications (ISAC). We also comment on the status of standardization activities for RSMA.

Title: Graph Learning Across Data Silos
Authors: Xiang Zhang, Qiao Wang
Abstract: We consider the problem of inferring graph topology from smooth graph signals in a novel but practical scenario where data are located in distributed clients and prohibited from leaving local clients due to factors such as privacy concerns. The main difficulty in this task is how to exploit the potentially heterogeneous data of all clients under data silos. To this end, we first propose an auto-weighted multiple graph learning model to jointly learn a personalized graph for each local client and a single consensus graph for all clients. The personalized graphs match local data distributions, thereby mitigating data heterogeneity, while the consensus graph captures the global information. Moreover, the model can automatically assign appropriate contribution weights to local graphs based on their similarity to the consensus graph. We next devise a tailored algorithm to solve the induced problem, where all raw data are processed locally without leaving clients. Theoretically, we establish a provable estimation error bound and convergence analysis for the proposed model and algorithm. Finally, extensive experiments on synthetic and real data are carried out, and the results illustrate that our approach can learn graphs effectively in the target scenario.

Title: Neural Network Based Optimization of Transmit Beamforming and RIS Coefficients Using Channel Covariances in MISO Downlink
Authors: Khin Thandar Kyaw, Wiroonsak Santipach, Kritsada Mamat, Kamol Kaemarungsi, Kazuhiko Fukawa, Lunchakorn Wuttisittikulkij
Abstract: We propose an unsupervised beamforming neural network (BNN) and a supervised reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) convolutional neural network (CNN) to optimize transmit beamforming and RIS coefficients of multi-input single-output (MISO) downlink with RIS assistance. To avoid frequent beam updates, the proposed BNN and RIS CNN are based on slow-changing channel covariances and are different from most other neural networks that utilize channel instances. Numerical simulations show that the proposed BNN with RIS CNN can achieve much higher sum rates than zeroforcing beamforming with waterfilling power allocation does, especially for systems with higher load, and reduces computation time.

Title: Non-Parametric Learning of Stochastic Differential Equations with Non-asymptotic Fast Rates of Convergence
Authors: Riccardo Bonalli, Alessandro Rudi
Abstract: We propose a novel non-parametric learning paradigm for the identification of drift and diffusion coefficients of multi-dimensional non-linear stochastic differential equations, which relies upon discrete-time observations of the state. The key idea essentially consists of fitting a RKHS-based approximation of the corresponding Fokker-Planck equation to such observations, yielding theoretical estimates of non-asymptotic learning rates which, unlike previous works, become increasingly tighter when the regularity of the unknown drift and diffusion coefficients becomes higher. Our method being kernel-based, offline pre-processing may be profitably leveraged to enable efficient numerical implementation, offering excellent balance between precision and computational complexity.

Title: Learning-Based Rich Feedback HARQ for Energy-Efficient Uplink Short Packet Transmission
Authors: Martin Voigt Vejling, Federico Chiariotti, Anders Ellersgaard Kalør, Deniz Gündüz, Gianluigi Liva, Petar Popovski
Abstract: The trade-off between reliability, latency, and energy efficiency is a central problem in communication systems. Advanced hybrid automated repeat request (HARQ) techniques reduce retransmissions required for reliable communication but incur high computational costs. Strict energy constraints apply mainly to devices, while the access point receiving their packets is usually connected to the electrical grid. Therefore, moving the computational complexity from the transmitter to the receiver may provide a way to improve this trade-off. We propose the reinforcement-based adaptive feedback (RAF) scheme, a departure from traditional single-bit feedback HARQ, introducing adaptive rich feedback where the receiver requests the coded retransmission of specific symbols. Simulation results show that RAF achieves a better trade-off between energy efficiency, reliability, and latency, compared to existing HARQ solutions. Our RAF scheme can easily adapt to different modulation schemes and can also generalize to different channel statistics.

Title: On convergence analysis of feedback control with integral action and discontinuous relay perturbation
Authors: Michael Ruderman
Abstract: We consider third-order dynamic systems which have an integral feedback action and discontinuous relay disturbance. More specifically for the applications, the focus is on the integral plus state-feedback control of the motion systems with discontinuous Coulomb-type friction. We recall the stiction region is globally attractive where the resulting hybrid system has also solutions in Filippov sense, while the motion trajectories remain in that idle state (called in tribology as stiction) until the formulated sliding-mode condition is violated by the growing integral feedback quantity. We analyze the conditions for occurrence of the slowly converging stick-slip cycles. We also show that the hybrid system is globally but only asymptotically stable, and almost always not exponentially. A particular case of the exponential convergence can appear for some initial values, assuming the characteristic equation of the linear subsystem has dominant real roots. Illustrative numerical examples are provided alongside with the developed analysis. In addition, a laboratory example is shown with experimental evidence to support the convergence analysis provided.

Title: Joint Communication and Sensing in OTFS-based UAV Networks
Authors: Alessandro Nordio, Carla Fabiana Chiasserini, Emanuele Viterbo
Abstract: We consider the problem of accurately localizing $N$ unmanned aerial vehicles (UAV) in 3D space where the UAVs are part of a swarm and communicate with each other through orthogonal time-frequency space (OTFS) modulated signals. The OTFS communication system operates in the delay-Doppler domain and can simultaneously provide range and velocity information about the scatterers in the channels at no additional cost. Each receiving UAV estimates the multipath wireless channel on each link formed by the line-of-sight (LoS) transmission and by the single reflections from the remaining $N-2$ UAVs. The estimated channel delay profiles are communicated to an edge server to estimate the location and velocity of the UAVs from the relative echo delay (RED) measurements between the LoS and the non-LoS paths. To accurately obtain such estimations, we propose a solution called Turbo Iterative Positioning (TIP), initialized by a belief-propagation approach. Enabling a full cold start (no prior knowledge of initial positions), the belief propagation first provides a map associating each echo to a reflecting UAV. The localization of the $N$ UAVs is then derived by iteratively alternating a gradient descent optimization and a refinement of the association maps between UAVs and echos. Given that the OTFS receivers also acquire the Doppler shifts of each path, the UAV's velocities can be sensed jointly with communication. Our numerical results, obtained also using real-world traces, show how the multipath links are beneficial to achieving very accurate position and velocity for all UAVs, even with a limited delay-Doppler resolution. The robustness of our scheme is proven by its performance approaching the Cramer-Rao bound.

Title: HyperFusion: A Hypernetwork Approach to Multimodal Integration of Tabular and Medical Imaging Data for Predictive Modeling
Authors: Daniel Duenias, Brennan Nichyporuk, Tal Arbel, Tammy Riklin Raviv
Abstract: The integration of diverse clinical modalities such as medical imaging and the tabular data extracted from patients' Electronic Health Records (EHRs) is a crucial aspect of modern healthcare. Integrative analysis of multiple sources can provide a comprehensive understanding of the clinical condition of a patient, improving diagnosis and treatment decision. Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) consistently demonstrate outstanding performance in a wide range of multimodal tasks in the medical domain. However, the complex endeavor of effectively merging medical imaging with clinical, demographic and genetic information represented as numerical tabular data remains a highly active and ongoing research pursuit. We present a novel framework based on hypernetworks to fuse clinical imaging and tabular data by conditioning the image processing on the EHR's values and measurements. This approach aims to leverage the complementary information present in these modalities to enhance the accuracy of various medical applications. We demonstrate the strength and generality of our method on two different brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) analysis tasks, namely, brain age prediction conditioned by subject's sex and multi-class Alzheimer's Disease (AD) classification conditioned by tabular data. We show that our framework outperforms both single-modality models and state-of-the-art MRI tabular data fusion methods. A link to our code can be found at this https URL

Title: IRSRMamba: Infrared Image Super-Resolution via Mamba-based Wavelet Transform Feature Modulation Model
Authors: Yongsong Huang, Tomo Miyazaki, Xiaofeng Liu, Shinichiro Omachi
Abstract: Infrared image super-resolution demands long-range dependency modeling and multi-scale feature extraction to address challenges such as homogeneous backgrounds, weak edges, and sparse textures. While Mamba-based state-space models (SSMs) excel in global dependency modeling with linear complexity, their block-wise processing disrupts spatial consistency, limiting their effectiveness for IR image reconstruction. We propose IRSRMamba, a novel framework integrating wavelet transform feature modulation for multi-scale adaptation and an SSMs-based semantic consistency loss to restore fragmented contextual information. This design enhances global-local feature fusion, structural coherence, and fine-detail preservation while mitigating block-induced artifacts. Experiments on benchmark datasets demonstrate that IRSRMamba outperforms state-of-the-art methods in PSNR, SSIM, and perceptual quality. This work establishes Mamba-based architectures as a promising direction for high-fidelity IR image enhancement. Code are available at this https URL.

Title: A Master-Follower Teleoperation System for Robotic Catheterization: Design, Characterization, and Tracking Control
Authors: Ali A. Nazari, Jeremy Catania, Soroush Sadeghian, Amir Jalali, Houman Masnavi, Farrokh Janabi-Sharifi, Kourosh Zareinia
Abstract: Minimally invasive robotic surgery has gained significant attention over the past two decades. Telerobotic systems, combined with robot-mediated minimally invasive techniques, have enabled surgeons and clinicians to mitigate radiation exposure for medical staff and extend medical services to remote and hard-to-reach areas. To enhance these services, teleoperated robotic surgery systems incorporating master and follower devices should offer transparency, enabling surgeons and clinicians to remotely experience a force interaction similar to the one the follower device experiences with patients' bodies. This paper presents the design and development of a three-degree-of-freedom master-follower teleoperated system for robotic catheterization. To resemble manual intervention by clinicians, the follower device features a grip-insert-release mechanism to eliminate catheter buckling and torsion during operation. The bidirectionally navigable ablation catheter is statically characterized for force-interactive medical interventions. The system's performance is evaluated through approaching and open-loop path tracking over typical circular, infinity-like, and spiral paths. Path tracking errors are presented as mean Euclidean error (MEE) and mean absolute error (MAE). The MEE ranges from 0.64 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.53 cm (spiral path). The MAE also ranges from 0.81 cm (infinity-like path) to 1.92 cm (spiral path). The results indicate that while the system's precision and accuracy with an open-loop controller meet the design targets, closed-loop controllers are necessary to address the catheter's hysteresis and dead zone, and system nonlinearities.

Title: Downlink CCM Estimation via Representation Learning with Graph Regularization
Authors: Melih Can Zerin, Elif Vural, Ali Özgür Yılmaz
Abstract: In this paper, we propose an algorithm for downlink (DL) channel covariance matrix (CCM) estimation for frequency division duplexing (FDD) massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) communication systems with base station (BS) possessing a uniform linear array (ULA) antenna structure. We consider a setting where the UL CCM is mapped to DL CCM by a mapping function. We first present a theoretical error analysis of learning a nonlinear embedding by constructing a mapping function, which points to the importance of the Lipschitz regularity of the mapping function for achieving high estimation performance. Then, based on the theoretical ground, we propose a representation learning algorithm as a solution for the estimation problem, where Gaussian RBF kernel interpolators are chosen to map UL CCMs to their DL counterparts. The proposed algorithm is based on the optimization of an objective function that fits a regression model between the DL CCM and UL CCM samples in the training dataset and preserves the local geometric structure of the data in the UL CCM space, while explicitly regulating the Lipschitz continuity of the mapping function in light of our theoretical findings. The proposed algorithm surpasses benchmark methods in terms of three error metrics as shown by simulations.

Title: Global-Local Distillation Network-Based Audio-Visual Speaker Tracking with Incomplete Modalities
Authors: Yidi Li, Yihan Li, Yixin Guo, Bin Ren, Zhenhuan Xu, Hao Guo, Hong Liu, Nicu Sebe
Abstract: In speaker tracking research, integrating and complementing multi-modal data is a crucial strategy for improving the accuracy and robustness of tracking systems. However, tracking with incomplete modalities remains a challenging issue due to noisy observations caused by occlusion, acoustic noise, and sensor failures. Especially when there is missing data in multiple modalities, the performance of existing multi-modal fusion methods tends to decrease. To this end, we propose a Global-Local Distillation-based Tracker (GLDTracker) for robust audio-visual speaker tracking. GLDTracker is driven by a teacher-student distillation model, enabling the flexible fusion of incomplete information from each modality. The teacher network processes global signals captured by camera and microphone arrays, and the student network handles local information subject to visual occlusion and missing audio channels. By transferring knowledge from teacher to student, the student network can better adapt to complex dynamic scenes with incomplete observations. In the student network, a global feature reconstruction module based on the generative adversarial network is constructed to reconstruct global features from feature embedding with missing local information. Furthermore, a multi-modal multi-level fusion attention is introduced to integrate the incomplete feature and the reconstructed feature, leveraging the complementarity and consistency of audio-visual and global-local features. Experimental results on the AV16.3 dataset demonstrate that the proposed GLDTracker outperforms existing state-of-the-art audio-visual trackers and achieves leading performance on both standard and incomplete modalities datasets, highlighting its superiority and robustness in complex conditions. The code and models will be available.

Title: RoboMNIST: A Multimodal Dataset for Multi-Robot Activity Recognition Using WiFi Sensing, Video, and Audio
Authors: Kian Behzad, Rojin Zandi, Elaheh Motamedi, Hojjat Salehinejad, Milad Siami
Abstract: We introduce a novel dataset for multi-robot activity recognition (MRAR) using two robotic arms integrating WiFi channel state information (CSI), video, and audio data. This multimodal dataset utilizes signals of opportunity, leveraging existing WiFi infrastructure to provide detailed indoor environmental sensing without additional sensor deployment. Data were collected using two Franka Emika robotic arms, complemented by three cameras, three WiFi sniffers to collect CSI, and three microphones capturing distinct yet complementary audio data streams. The combination of CSI, visual, and auditory data can enhance robustness and accuracy in MRAR. This comprehensive dataset enables a holistic understanding of robotic environments, facilitating advanced autonomous operations that mimic human-like perception and interaction. By repurposing ubiquitous WiFi signals for environmental sensing, this dataset offers significant potential aiming to advance robotic perception and autonomous systems. It provides a valuable resource for developing sophisticated decision-making and adaptive capabilities in dynamic environments.

Title: Lyapunov Neural ODE State-Feedback Control Policies
Authors: Joshua Hang Sai Ip, Georgios Makrygiorgos, Ali Mesbah
Abstract: Deep neural networks are increasingly used as an effective way to represent control policies in various learning-based control paradigms. For continuous-time optimal control problems (OCPs), which are central to many decision-making tasks, control policy learning can be cast as a neural ordinary differential equation (NODE) problem wherein state and control constraints are naturally accommodated. This paper presents a NODE approach to solving continuous-time OCPs for the case of stabilizing a known constrained nonlinear system around an equilibrium state. The approach, termed Lyapunov-NODE control (L-NODEC), uses a novel Lyapunov loss formulation that incorporates an exponentially-stabilizing control Lyapunov function to learn a state-feedback neural control policy. The proposed Lyapunov loss allows L-NODEC to guarantee exponential stability of the controlled system, as well as its adversarial robustness to perturbations to the initial state. The performance of L-NODEC is illustrated in two problems, including a dose delivery problem in plasma medicine, wherein L-NODEC effectively stabilizes the controlled system around the equilibrium state despite perturbations to the initial state and reduces the inference time necessary to reach equilibrium.

Title: MoWE-Audio: Multitask AudioLLMs with Mixture of Weak Encoders
Authors: Wenyu Zhang, Shuo Sun, Bin Wang, Xunlong Zou, Zhuohan Liu, Yingxu He, Geyu Lin, Nancy F. Chen, Ai Ti Aw
Abstract: The rapid advancements in large language models (LLMs) have significantly enhanced natural language processing capabilities, facilitating the development of AudioLLMs that process and understand speech and audio inputs alongside text. Existing AudioLLMs typically combine a pre-trained audio encoder with a pre-trained LLM, which are subsequently finetuned on specific audio tasks. However, the pre-trained audio encoder has constrained capacity to capture features for new tasks and datasets. To address this, we propose to incorporate mixtures of `weak' encoders (MoWE) into the AudioLLM framework. MoWE supplements a base encoder with a pool of relatively light weight encoders, selectively activated based on the audio input to enhance feature extraction without significantly increasing model size. Our empirical results demonstrate that MoWE effectively improves multi-task performance, broadening the applicability of AudioLLMs to more diverse audio tasks.

Title: S2Cap: A Benchmark and a Baseline for Singing Style Captioning
Authors: Hyunjong Ok, Jaeho Lee
Abstract: Singing voices contain much richer information than common voices, such as diverse vocal and acoustic characteristics. However, existing open-source audio-text datasets for singing voices capture only a limited set of attributes and lacks acoustic features, leading to limited utility towards downstream tasks, such as style captioning. To fill this gap, we formally consider the task of singing style captioning and introduce S2Cap, a singing voice dataset with comprehensive descriptions of diverse vocal, acoustic and demographic attributes. Based on this dataset, we develop a simple yet effective baseline algorithm for the singing style captioning. The algorithm utilizes two novel technical components: CRESCENDO for mitigating misalignment between pretrained unimodal models, and demixing supervision to regularize the model to focus on the singing voice. Despite its simplicity, the proposed method outperforms state-of-the-art baselines.

Title: MusicLIME: Explainable Multimodal Music Understanding
Authors: Theodoros Sotirou, Vassilis Lyberatos, Orfeas Menis Mastromichalakis, Giorgos Stamou
Abstract: Multimodal models are critical for music understanding tasks, as they capture the complex interplay between audio and lyrics. However, as these models become more prevalent, the need for explainability grows-understanding how these systems make decisions is vital for ensuring fairness, reducing bias, and fostering trust. In this paper, we introduce MusicLIME, a model-agnostic feature importance explanation method designed for multimodal music models. Unlike traditional unimodal methods, which analyze each modality separately without considering the interaction between them, often leading to incomplete or misleading explanations, MusicLIME reveals how audio and lyrical features interact and contribute to predictions, providing a holistic view of the model's decision-making. Additionally, we enhance local explanations by aggregating them into global explanations, giving users a broader perspective of model behavior. Through this work, we contribute to improving the interpretability of multimodal music models, empowering users to make informed choices, and fostering more equitable, fair, and transparent music understanding systems.

Title: X-Fi: A Modality-Invariant Foundation Model for Multimodal Human Sensing
Authors: Xinyan Chen, Jianfei Yang
Abstract: Human sensing, which employs various sensors and advanced deep learning technologies to accurately capture and interpret human body information, has significantly impacted fields like public security and robotics. However, current human sensing primarily depends on modalities such as cameras and LiDAR, each of which has its own strengths and limitations. Furthermore, existing multi-modal fusion solutions are typically designed for fixed modality combinations, requiring extensive retraining when modalities are added or removed for diverse scenarios. In this paper, we propose a modality-invariant foundation model for all modalities, X-Fi, to address this issue. X-Fi enables the independent or combinatory use of sensor modalities without additional training by utilizing a transformer structure to accommodate variable input sizes and incorporating a novel "X-fusion" mechanism to preserve modality-specific features during multimodal integration. This approach not only enhances adaptability but also facilitates the learning of complementary features across modalities. Extensive experiments conducted on the MM-Fi and XRF55 datasets, employing six distinct modalities, demonstrate that X-Fi achieves state-of-the-art performance in human pose estimation (HPE) and human activity recognition (HAR) tasks. The findings indicate that our proposed model can efficiently support a wide range of human sensing applications, ultimately contributing to the evolution of scalable, multimodal sensing technologies.

Title: Image-Based Visual Servoing for Enhanced Cooperation of Dual-Arm Manipulation
Authors: Zizhe Zhang, Yuan Yang, Wenqiang Zuo, Guangming Song, Aiguo Song, Yang Shi
Abstract: The cooperation of a pair of robot manipulators is required to manipulate a target object without any fixtures. The conventional control methods coordinate the end-effector pose of each manipulator with that of the other using their kinematics and joint coordinate measurements. Yet, the manipulators' inaccurate kinematics and joint coordinate measurements can cause significant pose synchronization errors in practice. This paper thus proposes an image-based visual servoing approach for enhancing the cooperation of a dual-arm manipulation system. On top of the classical control, the visual servoing controller lets each manipulator use its carried camera to measure the image features of the other's marker and adapt its end-effector pose with the counterpart on the move. Because visual measurements are robust to kinematic errors, the proposed control can reduce the end-effector pose synchronization errors and the fluctuations of the interaction forces of the pair of manipulators on the move. Theoretical analyses have rigorously proven the stability of the closed-loop system. Comparative experiments on real robots have substantiated the effectiveness of the proposed control.

Title: Adaptive NAD: Online and Self-adaptive Unsupervised Network Anomaly Detector
Authors: Yachao Yuan, Yu Huang, Yali Yuan, Jin Wang
Abstract: The widespread usage of the Internet of Things (IoT) has raised the risks of cyber threats, thus developing Anomaly Detection Systems (ADSs) that can adapt to evolving or new attacks is critical. Previous studies primarily focused on offline unsupervised learning methods to safeguard ADSs, which is not applicable in practical real-world applications. Besides, most of them strongly rely on assumptions of known legitimates and fail to satisfy the interpretable requirements in security applications, creating barriers to the adoption in practice. In this paper, we design Adaptive NAD, a general framework to improve and interpret online unsupervised anomaly detection in security domains. An interpretable two-layer anomaly detection strategy is proposed to generate reliable high-confidence pseudo-labels. Then, an online learning scheme is introduced to update Adaptive NAD by a novel threshold calculation technique to adapt to new threats. Experimental results demonstrate that Adaptive NAD achieves more than 5.4%, 23.0%, and 3.2% improvements in SPAUC compared with state-of-the-art solutions on the CIC-Darknet2020, CIC-DoHBrw-2020, and Edge-IIoTset datasets, respectively.

Title: Towards Scalable Insect Monitoring: Ultra-Lightweight CNNs as On-Device Triggers for Insect Camera Traps
Authors: Ross Gardiner, Sareh Rowands, Benno I. Simmons
Abstract: Camera traps, combined with AI, have emerged as a way to achieve automated, scalable biodiversity monitoring. However, the passive infrared (PIR) sensors that trigger camera traps are poorly suited for detecting small, fast-moving ectotherms such as insects. Insects comprise over half of all animal species and are key components of ecosystems and agriculture. The need for an appropriate and scalable insect camera trap is critical in the wake of concerning reports of declines in insect populations. This study proposes an alternative to the PIR trigger: ultra-lightweight convolutional neural networks running on low-powered hardware to detect insects in a continuous stream of captured images. We train a suite of models to distinguish insect images from backgrounds. Our design achieves zero latency between trigger and image capture. Our models are rigorously tested and achieve high accuracy ranging from 91.8% to 96.4% AUC on validation data and >87% AUC on data from distributions unseen during training. The high specificity of our models ensures minimal saving of false positive images, maximising deployment storage efficiency. High recall scores indicate a minimal false negative rate, maximising insect detection. Further analysis with saliency maps shows the learned representation of our models to be robust, with low reliance on spurious background features. Our system is also shown to operate deployed on off-the-shelf, low-powered microcontroller units, consuming a maximum power draw of less than 300mW. This enables longer deployment times using cheap and readily available battery components. Overall we offer a step change in the cost, efficiency and scope of insect monitoring. Solving the challenging trigger problem, we demonstrate a system which can be deployed for far longer than existing designs and budgets power and bandwidth effectively, moving towards a generic insect camera trap.

Title: Optimal Beamforming for Multi-User Continuous Aperture Array (CAPA) Systems
Authors: Zhaolin Wang, Chongjun Ouyang, Yuanwei Liu
Abstract: The optimal beamforming design for multi-user continuous aperture array (CAPA) systems is proposed. In contrast to conventional spatially discrete array (SPDA), the beamformer for CAPA is a continuous function rather than a discrete vector or matrix, rendering beamforming optimization a non-convex integral-based functional programming. To address this challenging issue, the closed-form optimal structure of the CAPA beamformer is first derived for maximizing generic system utility functions, by addressing the inversion of continuous functions and using the Lagrangian duality and the calculus of variations. The derived optimal structure is a linear combination of the continuous channel responses for CAPA, with the linear weights determined by the channel correlations. As a further advance, a monotonic optimization method is proposed for obtaining globally optimal CAPA beamforming based on the derived optimal structure. More particularly, a closed-form fixed-point iteration is proposed to obtain the globally optimal solution to the power minimization problem for CAPA beamforming. Furthermore, based on the optimal structure, the low-complexity maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF), and minimum mean-squared error (MMSE) designs for CAPA beamforming are derived. It is theoretically proved that: 1) the MRT and ZF designs are asymptotically optimal in low and high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) regimes, respectively, and 2) the MMSE design is optimal for signal-to-leakage-plus-noise ratio (SLNR) maximization. Our numerical results validate the effectiveness of the proposed designs and reveal that: i) CAPA achieves significant communication performance gain over SPDA, and ii) the MMSE design achieves nearly optimal performance in most cases, while the MRT and ZF designs achieve nearly optimal performance in specific cases

Title: Gaussian multi-target filtering with target dynamics driven by a stochastic differential equation
Authors: Ángel F. García-Fernández, Simo Särkkä
Abstract: This paper proposes multi-target filtering algorithms in which target dynamics are given in continuous time and measurements are obtained at discrete time instants. In particular, targets appear according to a Poisson point process (PPP) in time with a given Gaussian spatial distribution, targets move according to a general time-invariant linear stochastic differential equation, and the life span of each target is modelled with an exponential distribution. For this multi-target dynamic model, we derive the distribution of the set of new born targets and calculate closed-form expressions for the best fitting mean and covariance of each target at its time of birth by minimising the Kullback-Leibler divergence via moment matching. This yields a novel Gaussian continuous-discrete Poisson multi-Bernoulli mixture (PMBM) filter, and its approximations based on Poisson multi-Bernoulli and probability hypothesis density filtering. These continuous-discrete multi-target filters are also extended to target dynamics driven by nonlinear stochastic differential equations.

Authors: Pratik Shrestha, Sujan Kapali, Swikar Gautam, Vishal Pokharel, Santosh Giri
Abstract: This paper introduces a mobile-based solution that enhances online shoe shopping through 3D modeling and Augmented Reality (AR), leveraging the efficiency of 3D Gaussian Splatting. Addressing the limitations of static 2D images, the framework generates realistic 3D shoe models from 2D images, achieving an average Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (PSNR) of 32, and enables immersive AR interactions via smartphones. A custom shoe segmentation dataset of 3120 images was created, with the best-performing segmentation model achieving an Intersection over Union (IoU) score of 0.95. This paper demonstrates the potential of 3D modeling and AR to revolutionize online shopping by offering realistic virtual interactions, with applicability across broader fashion categories.

Title: Improving Acoustic Side-Channel Attacks on Keyboards Using Transformers and Large Language Models
Authors: Jin Hyun Park, Seyyed Ali Ayati, Yichen Cai
Abstract: The increasing prevalence of microphones in everyday devices and the growing reliance on online services have amplified the risk of acoustic side-channel attacks (ASCAs) targeting keyboards. This study explores deep learning techniques, specifically vision transformers (VTs) and large language models (LLMs), to enhance the effectiveness and applicability of such attacks. We present substantial improvements over prior research, with the CoAtNet model achieving state-of-the-art performance. Our CoAtNet shows a 5.0% improvement for keystrokes recorded via smartphone (Phone) and 5.9% for those recorded via Zoom compared to previous benchmarks. We also evaluate transformer architectures and language models, with the best VT model matching CoAtNet's performance. A key advancement is the introduction of a noise mitigation method for real-world scenarios. By using LLMs for contextual understanding, we detect and correct erroneous keystrokes in noisy environments, enhancing ASCA performance. Additionally, fine-tuned lightweight language models with Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA) deliver comparable performance to heavyweight models with 67X more parameters. This integration of VTs and LLMs improves the practical applicability of ASCA mitigation, marking the first use of these technologies to address ASCAs and error correction in real-world scenarios.

Title: CLaMP 3: Universal Music Information Retrieval Across Unaligned Modalities and Unseen Languages
Authors: Shangda Wu, Zhancheng Guo, Ruibin Yuan, Junyan Jiang, Seungheon Doh, Gus Xia, Juhan Nam, Xiaobing Li, Feng Yu, Maosong Sun
Abstract: CLaMP 3 is a unified framework developed to address challenges of cross-modal and cross-lingual generalization in music information retrieval. Using contrastive learning, it aligns all major music modalities--including sheet music, performance signals, and audio recordings--with multilingual text in a shared representation space, enabling retrieval across unaligned modalities with text as a bridge. It features a multilingual text encoder adaptable to unseen languages, exhibiting strong cross-lingual generalization. Leveraging retrieval-augmented generation, we curated M4-RAG, a web-scale dataset consisting of 2.31 million music-text pairs. This dataset is enriched with detailed metadata that represents a wide array of global musical traditions. To advance future research, we release WikiMT-X, a benchmark comprising 1,000 triplets of sheet music, audio, and richly varied text descriptions. Experiments show that CLaMP 3 achieves state-of-the-art performance on multiple MIR tasks, significantly surpassing previous strong baselines and demonstrating excellent generalization in multimodal and multilingual music contexts.
