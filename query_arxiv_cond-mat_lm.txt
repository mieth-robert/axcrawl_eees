Title: Harnessing Artificial Intelligence for Modeling Amorphous and Amorphous Porous Palladium: A Deep Neural Network Approach
Authors: Isaías Rodríguez
Abstract: Amorphous and amorphous porous palladium are key materials for catalysis, hydrogen storage, and functional applications, but their complex structures present computational challenges. This study employs a deep neural network trained on 33,310 atomic configurations from ab initio molecular dynamics simulations to model their interatomic potential. The AI-driven approach accurately predicts structural and thermal properties while significantly reducing computational costs. Validation against density functional theory confirms its reliability in reproducing forces, energies, and structural distributions. These findings highlight AI's potential in accelerating the study of amorphous materials and advancing their applications in energy and catalysis.

Title: Accelerated Transition Rates in Generalized Kramers Problems for Non-Variational, Non-Normal System
Authors: Virgile Troude, Didier Sornette
Abstract: Kramers' escape problem serves as a paradigm for understanding transitions and various types of reactions, such as chemical and nuclear reactions, in systems driven by thermal fluctuations and damping, particularly within the realm of classical variational dynamics. Here, we generalize Kramers' problem to processes with non-normal dynamics characterized by asymmetry, hierarchy, and stochastic fluctuations, where transient amplification and stochastic perturbations play a critical role. The obtained generalized escape rates are structurally similar to those for variational systems, but with a renormalized temperature proportional to the square of the condition number k which measures non-normality. Because k can take large values (e.g., 10 r more) in many systems, the resulting acceleration of transition rates can be enormous, given the exponential dependence on the inverse temperature in Kramers' formula. We propose that non-normal accelerated escape rates are relevant to a wide range of systems, including biological metabolism, ecosystem shifts, climate dynamics, and socio-economic processes.

Title: Origin of the Zeroth Law of Thermodynamics and its Role in Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Kim Sharp
Abstract: In statistical mechanics the zeroth law of thermodynamics is taken as a postulate which, as its name indicates, logically precedes the first and second laws. Treating it as a postulate has consequences for how temperature is introduced into statistical mechanics and for the molecular interpretation of temperature. One can, however, derive the zeroth law from first principles starting from a classical Hamiltonian using basic mechanics and a geometric representation of the phase space of kinetic energy configurations - the velocity hypersphere. In this approach there is no difficulty in providing a molecular interpretation of temperature, nor in deriving equality of temperature as the condition of thermal equilibrium. The approach to the macroscopic limit as a function of the number of atoms is easily determined. One also obtains with little difficulty the Boltzmann probability distribution, the statistical mechanical definition of entropy and the configuration partition function. These relations, along with the zeroth law, emerge as straightforward consequences of atoms in random motion.

Title: Anomalous suppression of large-scale density fluctuations in classical and quantum spin liquids
Authors: Duyu Chen, Rhine Samajdar, Yang Jiao, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Classical spin liquids (CSLs) are intriguing states of matter that do not exhibit long-range magnetic order and are characterized by an extensive ground-state degeneracy. Adding quantum fluctuations, which induce dynamics between these different classical ground states, can give rise to quantum spin liquids (QSLs). QSLs are highly entangled quantum phases of matter characterized by fascinating emergent properties, such as fractionalized excitations and topological order. One such exotic quantum liquid is the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QSL, which can be regarded as a resonating valence bond (RVB) state formed from superpositions of dimer coverings of an underlying lattice. In this work, we unveil a \textit{hidden} large-scale structural property of archetypal CSLs and QSLs known as hyperuniformity, i.e., normalized infinite-wavelength density fluctuations are completely suppressed in these systems. In particular, we first demonstrate that classical ensembles of close-packed dimers and their corresponding quantum RVB states are perfectly hyperuniform in general. Subsequently, we focus on a ruby-lattice spin liquid that was recently realized in a Rydberg-atom quantum simulator, and show that the QSL remains effectively hyperuniform even in the presence of a finite density of spinon and vison excitations, as long as the dimer constraint is still largely preserved. Moreover, we demonstrate that metrics based on the framework of hyperuniformity can be used to distinguish the QSL from other proximate quantum phases. These metrics can help identify potential QSL candidates, which can then be further analyzed using more advanced, computationally-intensive quantum numerics to confirm their status as true QSLs.

Title: Structural Modulation and Enhanced Magnetic Ordering in Incommensurate K$_{1-{x}}$CrSe$_2$ Crystals
Authors: Felix Eder, Catherine Witteveen, Enrico Giannini, Fabian O. von Rohr
Abstract: Layered delafossite-type compounds and related transition metal dichalcogenides, characterized by their triangular net structures, serve as prototypical systems for exploring the intricate interplay between crystal structure and magnetic behavior. Herein, we report on the discovery of the compound K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ ($x \approx$ 0.13), an incommensurately modulated phase. Single crystals of this compound were grown for the first time using a K/Se self-flux. We find a monoclinic crystal structure with incommensurate modulation, that can be rationalized by a 3+1 dimensional model. This modulation compensates for the under-stoichiometry of K cations, creating pronounced undulations in the CrSe$_2$ layers. Our anisotropic magnetization measurements reveal that K$_{1-x}$CrSe$_2$ undergoes a transition to a long-range magnetically ordered state below $T_{\mathrm N}$ = 133 K, a temperature 1.6 to 3.3 times higher than in earlier reported KCrSe$_2$ compounds. Our findings open new avenues for tuning the magnetic properties of these layered materials through structural modulation.

Title: Is attention all you need to solve the correlated electron problem?
Authors: Max Geier, Khachatur Nazaryan, Timothy Zaklama, Liang Fu
Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moiré quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate, efficient, and unbiased solution. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.

Title: Magnon-phonon interactions from first principles
Authors: Khoa B. Le, Ali Esquembre-Kucukalic, Hsiao-Yi Chen, Ivan Maliyov, Jin-Jian Zhou, Davide Sangalli, Alejandro Molina-Sanchez, Marco Bernardi
Abstract: Modeling spin-wave (magnon) dynamics in novel materials is important to advance spintronics and spin-based quantum technologies. The interactions between magnons and lattice vibrations (phonons) limit the length scale for magnon transport. However, quantifying these interactions remains challenging. Here we show many-body calculations of magnon-phonon (mag-ph) coupling based on the ab initio Bethe-Salpeter equation. We derive expressions for mag-ph coupling matrices and compute them in 2D ferromagnets, focusing on hydrogenated graphene and monolayer CrI3. Our analysis shows that electron-phonon (e-ph) and mag-ph interactions differ significantly, where modes with weak e-ph coupling can exhibit strong mag-ph coupling (and vice versa), and reveals which phonon modes couple more strongly with magnons. In both materials studied here, the inelastic magnon relaxation time is found to decrease abruptly above the threshold for emission of strongly coupled phonons, thereby defining a low-energy window for efficient magnon transport. By averaging in this window, we compute the temperature-dependent magnon mean-free path, a key figure of merit for spintronics, entirely from first principles. The theory and computational tools shown in this work enable studies of magnon interactions, scattering, and dynamics in generic materials, advancing the design of magnetic systems and magnon- and spin-based devices.

Title: Modular programming of interaction and geometric specificity enables assembly of complex DNA origami nanostructures
Authors: Rupam Saha, Daichi Hayakawa, Thomas E. Videbaek, Mason Price, Wei-Shao Wei, Juanita Pombo, Daniel Duke, Gaurav Arya, Gregory M. Grason, W. Benjamin Rogers, Seth Fraden
Abstract: We present a modular DNA origami design approach to address the challenges of assembling geometrically complex nanoscale structures, including those with nonuniform Gaussian curvature. This approach features a core structure that completely conserves the scaffold routing across different designs and preserves more than 70% of the DNA staples between designs, dramatically reducing both cost and effort, while enabling precise and independent programming of subunit interactions and binding angles through adjustable overhang lengths and sequences. Using cryogenic electron microscopy, gel electrophoresis, and coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations, we validate a set of robust design rules. We demonstrate the method's utility by assembling a variety of self-limiting structures, including anisotropic shells with controlled inter-subunit interactions and curvature, and a toroid with globally varying curvature. Our strategy is both cost-effective and versatile, providing a promising and efficient solution for the synthetic fabrication of complex nanostructures.

Title: Machine learning-guided construction of an analytic kinetic energy functional for orbital free density functional theory
Authors: Sergei Manzhos, Johann Luder, Manabu Ihara
Abstract: Machine learning (ML) of kinetic energy functionals (KEF) for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT) holds the promise of addressing an important bottleneck in large-scale ab initio materials modeling where sufficiently accurate analytic KEFs are lacking. However, ML models are not as easily handled as analytic expressions; they need to be provided in the form of algorithms and associated data. Here, we bridge the two approaches and construct an analytic expression for a KEF guided by interpretative machine learning of crystal cell-averaged kinetic energy densities ({\tau}) of several hundred materials. A previously published dataset including multiple phases of 433 unary, binary, and ternary compounds containing Li, Al, Mg, Si, As, Ga, Sb, Na, Sn, P, and In was used for training, including data at the equilibrium geometry as well as strained structures. A hybrid Gaussian process regression - neural network (GPR-NN) method was used to understand the type of functional dependence of {\tau} on the features which contained cell-averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the product of the electron density and Kohn-Sham effective potential. Based on this analysis, an analytic model is constructed that can reproduce Kohn-Sham DFT energy-volume curves with sufficient accuracy (pronounced minima that are sufficiently close to the minima of the Kohn-Sham DFT-based curves and with sufficiently close curvatures) to enable structure optimizations and elastic response calculations.

Title: Magnetic transition in marcasite FeTe2 induced by the competition between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion
Authors: Yue-Fei Hou, Zhibin Shao, Minghu Pan, Shiyang Wu, Fawei Zheng, Zhen-Guo Fu, Ping Zhang
Abstract: The determination of magnetic ground states in crystalline systems holds significant implications for both fundamental condensed matter physics and practical materials engineering. Marcasite-structured FeTe2, classified as a narrow-gap semiconductor, demonstrates anomalous magnetic behavior in low-temperature experimental investigations. This study employs first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations combined with scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy (STM/STS) to elucidate the magnetic ground state of marcasite FeTe2. Our analysis reveals that the interplay between crystal field splitting and Coulomb repulsion critically governs the formation of localized magnetic moments in Fe ions. While bulk FeTe2 is conclusively identified as non-magnetic in its ground state, we demonstrate that the previously observed magnetic responses originate from surface-localized magnetic Fe atoms in FeTe2 specimens. This work establishes a robust yet straightforward criterion for determining ground-state magnetism across diverse localized electron systems, providing critical insights for interpreting magnetic phenomena in correlated electron materials.

Title: Fabrication of self-powered photodetector materials based on Ni-doped ZnO/p-Si heterojunctions
Authors: Eka Nurfani, Aldi Saputra, Novalia Pertiwi, Muhamad F. Arif
Abstract: In this paper, Ni-doped ZnO films were grown on a p-type silicon substrate via spray pyrolysis. The Ni dopant concentrations were varied by adjusting the weight ratio between Zinc Acetate Dehydrate (ZAD) and Nickel Chloride Hexahydrate (NCH), resulting in the ZnO, ZnO:Ni1%, and ZnO:Ni3% samples. Field-effect scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images revealed that Ni doping significantly reduced the nanostructure size from 326 nm (ZnO) to 146 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Similarly, X-ray diffraction (XRD) analysis also shows the decrease of the crystallite size with increasing Ni doping, from 44 nm (ZnO) to 35 nm (ZnO:Ni3%). Current-voltage (I-V) measurements were conducted at a bias voltage of 0 and 5 V to examine electrical and self-powered photodetection properties. All samples demonstrate self-powered photodetector performance. At the bias of 0 V, the undoped ZnO exhibited a higher photo-to-dark-current ratio (162) as compared to ZnO:Ni1% (18) and ZnO:Ni3% (16). The ZnO:Ni3% samples displayed faster rise (0.4 s) and fall times (1.7 s) as compared to the pure ZnO (10.8 s for rise time and 9.1 s for fall time), highlighting their potential for applications requiring rapid photoresponse. The findings provide valuable insights into optimizing the performance of ZnO-based photodetectors through controlled Ni doping, enabling advancements in self-powered photodetection technology for energy-efficient optoelectronic devices.

Title: Prospects for market-specific design of Perovskite-Silicon tandem solar cells
Authors: Karthik Raitani, Pradeep R. Nair
Abstract: The quest for optimal perovskite for tandem cell configurations is challenging as it involves several factors ranging from device level performance under field conditions to degradation rates and cost. Here, we first show that the traditional detailed balance or Shockley-Queisser (SQ) analysis leads to a stringent as well as unoptimized selection criteria for top cell perovskite. On the other hand, through detailed numerical simulations of the annual energy yield, well calibrated with recent temperature dependent experimental results, we identify geographic location-specific criteria for selecting optimal top cell perovskites. Our simulations indicate that, for certain degradation rates, a broad range of perovskite materials could yield comparable levelized cost of electricity (LCOE) - in contrast to the traditional detailed balance analysis. Our quantitative analysis shows that the optimal choice of perovskites indeed depends on the geographic location and relative degradation rate thus elucidating the prospects for market-specific design of P/Si tandem solar cells.

Title: Superconducting Properties of the Titanium-Based Oxides Compounds: A Review
Authors: Junqi He, Yi Zhou
Abstract: In recent years, the superconductivity of novel layered materials, titanium-based pnictide oxides, was discovered. Due to the properties of possessing both cuprate and iron-based superconductors, these compounds have attracted the interest of researchers. Titanium pnictide oxides were reported to have CDW or SDW anomalies, theoretical calculations indicate that this DW behavior originates from the Ti2O layer. These compounds which have Ti2O layers provide a basis for studying the relationship between superconductivity and DW behavior. Superconductivity and DW behavior are two different electronic behaviors that typically compete with each other, but sometimes coexist. The relationship between them has always been a focus of condensed matter physics research. Through in-depth research on titanium-based superconductors, it may help us explain the unconventional superconducting transition phenomena present in iron-based superconductors. In this review, we introduce the latest research on titanium pnictide oxides and the electronic properties of these novel superconductors.

Title: Stark Shift from Quantum Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Pei Li, Ran Xu, Bing Huang, Song Li
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride have emerged as promising candidates for quantum information applications, owing to their efficient and bright single photon emission. Despite the challenges in directly characterizing these emitters, the interaction between external fields and defects, such as the Stark shift, offers valuable insights into their local geometric configurations. In this study, we focus on clarifying the possible origin of the distinct Stark shift characteristics observed experimentally, particularly in the emission range around 2 eV. We find that the local symmetry of the defects plays a crucial role in determining the nature of the Stark shift, which can be either linear or quadratic. Additionally, the local dielectric environment significantly influences the Stark shift response. Our calculations not only enhance the understanding of the micro-structure of these hitherto unknown emitters but also pave the way for their more effective utilization as single-photon sources and qubits in quantum technologies.

Title: Preserving Twist-Angle in Marginally Twisted Double-Bilayer Graphene Devices During Fabrication
Authors: Hyeon-Woo Jeong, Jiho Kim, Boknam Chae, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Gil-Ho Lee
Abstract: Twisted van der Waals heterostructures provide a platform for studying a wide range of electron correlation phenomena, including unconventional superconductivity and correlated insulating states. However, fabricating such devices is challenging due to the difficulty in achieving and maintaining homogeneous twist-angles. Here, we present a fabrication method to preserve the twist-angle with minimal deformation. We fabricated marginally twisted double-bilayer graphene (mTDBG) stacks and directly imaged the resulting triangular superlattice periodicity via scattering-type scanning near-field optical microscopy (s-SNOM). This technique enabled us to monitor twist-angle deformation at each fabrication step, paving the way for more reliable device fabrication and facilitating the exploration of twist-angle-dependent physics.

Title: Quantum kinetic theory of semiclassical Boltzmann equation with side jump and skew scattering
Authors: Da Ma, Zhi-Fan Zhang, Hua Jiang, X. C. Xie
Abstract: The semiclassical Boltzmann equation is widely used to study transport effects. It is usually introduced in an intuitive fashion, which could cause confusion, e.g., over the collision integral with skew scattering. Actually, the Boltzmann equation is closely linked to the quantum density matrix, although term-by-term correspondence between the two is yet to be established. Here we start from the quantum Liouville equation in the interactive picture and show that the diagonal components of the equation yield the Boltzmann equation in homogeneous systems in an applied uniform electric field in the semiclassical limit, while the off-diagonal components give the anomalous velocity induced by Berry curvature and the side-jump velocity. The skew-scattering contribution is obtained when we include corrections beyond the first-Born approximation. The result derived from the denstiy matrix agrees with the semiclassical one from wave-packet analysis, showing that the semiclassical Boltzmann equation is more than an equation built from intuition, and it can be derived with the density matrix. Our work further clarifies the origin of the equation and eliminates the puzzles surrounding it.

Title: Collective Hysteron Behavior in Nonlinear Flow Networks
Authors: Lauren E. Altman, Nadia Awad, Douglas J. Durian, Miguel Ruiz-Garcia, Eleni Katifori
Abstract: Multistability-induced hysteresis has been widely studied in mechanical systems, but such behavior has proven more difficult to reproduce experimentally in flow networks. Natural flow networks like animal and plant vasculature exhibit complex nonlinear behavior to facilitate fluid transport, so multistable flows may inform their functionality. To probe such phenomena in an analogous model system, we utilize an electronic network of hysterons designed to have tunable negative differential resistivity. We demonstrate our system's capability to generate complex global memory states in the form of voltage patterns. The tunable nonlinearity of each element's current-voltage characteristic allows us to navigate this space of hysteretic behavior, and can be utilized to engineer more complex networks with exotic effects such as avalanches and multiperiodic orbits.

Title: Hyperparameter Optimization and Force Error Correction of Neuroevolution Potential for Predicting Thermal Conductivity of Wurtzite GaN
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Wenyang Ding, Shouhang Li, Meng An, Gang Zhang
Abstract: As a representative of wide-bandgap semiconductors, wurtzite gallium nitride (GaN) has been widely utilized in high-power devices due to high breakdown voltage and low specific on resistance. Accurate prediction of wurtzite GaN thermal conductivity is a prerequisite for designing effective thermal management systems of electronic applications. Machine learning driven molecular dynamics simulation offers a promising approach to predicting the thermal conductivity of large-scale systems without requiring predefined parameters. However, these methods often underestimate the thermal conductivity of materials with inherently high thermal conductivity due to the large predicted force error compared with first-principle calculation, posing a critical challenge for their broader application. In this study, we successfully developed a neuroevolution potential for wurtzite GaN and accurately predicted its thermal conductivity, 259 W/m-K at room temperatue, achieving excellent agreement with reported experimental measurements. The hyperparameters of neuroevolution potential (NEP) were optimized based on systematic analysis of reproduced energy and force, structural feature, computational efficiency. Furthermore, a force prediction error correction method was implemented, effectively reducing the error caused by the additional force noise in the Langevin thermostat by extrapolating to the zero-force error limit. This study provides valuable insights and hold significant implication for advancing efficient thermal management technologies in wide bandgap semiconductor devices.

Title: Softening of Vibrational Modes and Anharmonicity Induced Thermal Conductivity Reduction in a-Si:H at High Temperatures
Authors: Zhuo Chen, Yuejin Yuan, Yanzhou Wang, Penghua Ying, Shouhang Li, Cheng Shao, Wenyang Ding, Gang Zhang, Meng An
Abstract: Hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) has garnered considerable attention in the semiconductor industry, particularly for its use in solar cells and passivation layers for high performance silicon solar cells, owing to its exceptional photoelectric properties and scalable manufacturing processes. A comprehensive understanding of thermal transport mechanism in a-Si:H is essential for optimizing thermal management and ensuring the reliable operation of these devices. In this study, we developed a neuroevolution machine learning potential based on first-principles calculations of energy, forces, and virial, which enables accurate modeling of interatomic interactions in both a-Si:H and a-Si systems. Using the homogeneous nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (HNEMD) method, we systematically investigated the thermal conductivity of a-Si:H and a-Si across a temperature range of 300-1000 K and hydrogen concentrations ranging from 6 to 12 at%. Our simulation results found that thermal conductivity of a-Si:H with 12 at% hydrogen was significantly reduced by 12% compared to that of a-Si at 300 K. We analyzed the spectral thermal conductivity, vibrational density of states and lifetimes of vibrational modes, and revealed the softening of vibrational modes and anharmonicity effects contribute to the reduction of thermal conductivity as temperature and hydrogen concentration increase. Furthermore, the influence of hydrogen concentration and temperature on diffuson and propagon contribution to thermal conductivity of a-Si:H was revealed. This study provides valuable insights for developing thermal management strategies in silicon-based semiconducting devices and advances the understanding of thermal transport in amorphous systems.

Title: Dynamics of Baxter-Wu model
Authors: Chen Tang, Wanzhou Zhang, Chengxiang Ding
Abstract: Using Monte Carlo simulations, we investigated the dynamical properties of the Baxter-Wu model under linear quench. For the linear cooling process, the scaling behavior of the excess energy excitation density in the critical region aligns well with the predictions of the Kibble-Zurek (KZ) mechanism. However, the scaling behavior of the excess energy excitation density at the end of linear cooling does not conform to a simple interplay between the KZ mechanism and the coarsening process; after exiting the impulse regime, the system undergoes a decay close to a power-law form, with a decaying exponent that is significantly different from the coarsening exponent observed in instantaneous quenching. For the linear heating process, we found that if the initial state is the ground state of the model, the relevant exponents describing the KZ mechanism are identical to those in the cooling scenario. We find that the system does not directly enter the adiabatic regime after leaving the impulse regime but instead passes through a crossover regime with exponential decay of the excess energy excitation density. If the initial state is ordered but not the ground state of the system, the energy excitation density still exhibits good scaling behavior, but the relevant exponents do not conform to the predictions of the KZ mechanism. We found that this discrepancy is related to the peculiar zero-temperature dynamical properties arising from the unique ground states of the model.

Title: Power-law decay of force on cell membrane tethers reflects long-ranged relaxation of membrane tension
Authors: Emeline Laborie, Andrew Callan-Jones
Abstract: Membrane tension is an acknowledged regulator of a wide array of cell functions; however, whether it acts locally or globally in different contexts remains debated. Recent experiments that locally perturb tension and measure the response elsewhere on the membrane are not conclusive, and the mechanism of diffusive tension relaxation has been called into doubt. Here, we consider the tension response to a sudden extension of a membrane tether, and report a quantitative signature of dynamic tension relaxation, which up to now is missing. We present a theory based on tension diffusion leading to a prediction of power-law decay in time of the force holding the tether, with a material-independent exponent of 1/3. This prediction is confirmed to within a few percent by re-analyzing eleven sets of tether data from two cell types with distinct membrane cortical architectures. Overall, our scaling results indicate the absence of a relevant characteristic length and therefore generically reflect tension relaxation by long-range membrane lipid flows.

Title: Engineered Chirality of One-Dimensional Nanowires

Abstract: The origin and function of chirality in DNA, proteins, and other building blocks of life represent a central question in biology. Observations of spin polarization and magnetization associated with electron transport through chiral molecules, known collectively as the chiral induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, suggest that chirality improves electron transfer by inhibiting backscattering. Meanwhile, the role of coherence in the electron transport within chiral nanowires is believed to be important but is challenging to investigate experimentally. Using reconfigurable nanoscale control over conductivity at the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ interface, we create chiral electron potentials that explicitly lack mirror symmetry. Quantum transport measurements on these chiral regions that constitute effective nanowires for the electrons reveal oscillatory transmission resonances as a function of both magnetic field and chemical potential. We interpret these resonances as arising from an engineered axial spin-orbit interaction within the chiral region. The ability to create 1D effective electron waveguides with this specificity and complexity creates new opportunities to test, via analog quantum simulation, theories about the relationship between chirality and spin-polarized electron transport in one-dimensional geometries.

Title: Simulation study on Conservative Join (C-join) in Skyrmion Brownian circuit
Authors: H. Imanishi, E. Tamura, S. Miki, R. Ishikawa, H. Nomura, M. Goto, Y. Suzuki
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, which exhibit Brownian motion in solid-state systems, are promising candidates as signal carriers for Brownian computing. However, successfully implementing such systems requires two critical components: a Hub to connect multiple wires and a C-join to synchronize the skyrmion signal carriers. While the former has been successfully addressed, the latter remains a significant challenge. In this study, we propose a novel solution by decomposing the C-join into two sub-circuits, the Join and Fork, and validate their functionality using a particle simulation approach. Our results demonstrate that the C-join can effectively synchronize skyrmion signals within 6.8{\mu}s with a 99.9% success rate at low temperatures. Additionally, we construct the Half-adder in a crossing-free architecture utilizing the C-join circuits. These findings pave the way for the realization of skyrmion-based Brownian computing systems.

Title: Dynamic Control of Third-order Nonlinear Optical Properties of Gold Nanoparticle/Liquid Crystal Composites under External Electric Fields
Authors: Shengwei Wang, Mohamed Amine Gharbi, Chandra S Yelleswarapu
Abstract: This study investigates the dynamic control of third-order nonlinear optical absorption properties of gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) dispersed in nematic liquid crystals (LC). By leveraging the reconfigurable nature of liquid crystals under external electric fields, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate AuNP alignment, dimer formation, and subsequently the plasmon coupling effects. Planar oriented and degenerate LC cells were prepared, and their optical responses under varying electric fields were characterized using polarization microscopy, UV-VIS spectroscopy, and Z-scan techniques. In planar cells, the applied electric field reorients LC molecules and AuNPs, influencing plasmon coupling and the nonlinear absorption. Conversely, degenerate cells exhibit more complex behaviors due to multiple LC alignment directions. These findings illustrate the potential of AuNP/nematic LC systems for creating tunable photonic devices responsive to external stimuli.

Title: Altermagnetism in parallel-assembled single-atomic magnetic chains
Authors: Deping Guo, Canbo Zong, Cong Wang, Weihan Zhang, Wei Ji
Abstract: Altermagnetism has recently attracted significant interest in three- and two-dimensional materials, yet its realization in quasi-one-dimensional (Q1D) materials remains largely unexplored due to stringent symmetry constraints. Here, we systematically investigated the emergence of altermagnetism in 30 Q1D monolayer prototypes, self-assembled from intra-chain anti-ferrimagnetically coupled \(XY_n\) single-atomic magnetic chains, using symmetry analysis and high-throughput density functional theory calculations. Symmetry analysis identifies four structural prototypes capable of hosting altermagnetism, which expand to 192 monolayers upon materialization. Our calculations further reveal eight dynamically stable Q1D altermagnets, all belonging to the AA-stacked intra-chain AFM coupled \(\beta\)-\(XY_3\) prototype, exhibiting \(d\)-wave-like spin splitting. Furthermore, we demonstrate the tunability of altermagnetic properties by varying inter-chain spacing and applying external electric fields. By optimizing these parameters, altermagnetism can be significantly enhanced, with spin splitting reaching several hundred meV in CoTe\(_3\), or substantially suppressed, leading to a transition to a nodal-line semiconducting state in CrCl\(_3\). These findings establish a diverse and highly tunable family of Q1D altermagnetic candidate materials.

Title: Ultrafast X-ray induced damage and nonthermal melting in cadmium sulfide
Authors: Nikita Medvedev, Aldo Artímez Peña
Abstract: Cadmium sulfide is a valuable material for solar cells, photovoltaic, and radiation detectors. It is thus important to evaluate the material damage mechanisms and damage threshold in response to irradiation. Here, we simulate the ultrafast XUV/X-ray irradiation of CdS with the combined model, XTANT-3. It accounts for nonequilibrium electronic and atomic dynamics, nonadiabatic coupling between the two systems, nonthermal melting and bond breaking due to electronic excitation. We find that the two phases of CdS, zinc blende and wurtzite, demonstrate very close damage threshold dose of ~0.4-0.5 eV/atom. The damage is mainly thermal, whereas with increase of the dose, nonthermal effects begin to dominate leading to nonthermal melting. The transient disordered state is a high-density liquid, which may be semiconducting or metallic depending on the dose. Later recrystallization may recover the material back to the crystalline phase, or at high doses create an amorphous phase with variable bandgap. The revealed effects may potentially allow for controllable tuning of the band gap via laser irradiation of CdS.

Title: Achieving electrode smoothing by controlling the nucleation phase of metal deposition through polymer-substrate binding
Authors: Ying Xia, Duo Song, Mingyi Zhang, Zheming Wang, Chenyang Shi, Jingshan S. Du, Sun Hae Ra Shin, Mark H. Engelhard, Praveen K. Thallapally, Christine A. Orme, Jinhui Tao, Maria L. Sushko, James. J. De Yoreo, Jun Liu
Abstract: Polymer additives [like polyethylene oxide (PEO)] are widely used for smooth electrode deposition in aqueous zinc and a number of other battery systems currently investigated for energy storage applications. However, the precise mechanism by which they regulate morphology and suppress dendrite formation remains unclear. In this study, we address this knowledge gap by using in-situ electrochemical atomic force microscopy (EC-AFM) to directly observe the interfacial evolution during Zn electrodeposition and polymer adsorption on copper (Cu) substrates in the presence of varying concentrations of ZnSO4 and PEO. Contrary to previous literature assumptions which emphasize the binding to the growing Zn crystal surfaces or Zn2+ ions, our results demonstrate that PEO smooths Zn films by promoting nucleation of (002)-oriented Zn platelets through interactions with the Cu substrate. Density functional theory (DFT) simulations support this finding by showing that PEO adsorption on Cu modifies the interfacial energy of Zn/Cu/electrolyte interfaces, favoring the stabilization of Zn (002) on the Cu substrate, as well as confines Zn electrodeposition to a narrow near-surface region. These findings elucidate a novel design principle for electrode smoothing, emphasizing the importance of substrate selection paired with polymer additives that exhibit an attractive interaction with the substrate, but minimal interaction with growing crystals, offering a mechanistic perspective for improved battery performance.

Title: Thoughts about boosting superconductivity
Authors: Dirk van der Marel
Abstract: In a superconductor electrons form pairs despite the Coulomb repulsion as a result of an effective attractive interaction mediated by, for example phonons. In the present paper DeGennes' description of the dynamically screened Coulomb interaction is adopted for the effective interaction. This model is generalized by including the elastic response of the charge-compensating background and the BCS gap equation is solved for the resulting effective electron-electron interaction. It is demonstrated that the superconducting critical temperature becomes strongly enhanced when the material is tuned close to a structural instability.

Abstract: The topological properties of the one-dimensional interacting systems with spatially modulated interaction in two-particle regime are theoretically investigated. Taking the boson-Hubbard model and spinless fermion interacting model as examples, we show that the energy spectra for doublon (known as two-particle pair) as a function of modulated period exhibit the butterfly-like structure for strongly-correlated limit, whose topological features can be decoded by the topological invariants and topological nontrivial doublon bound edge states. When the nearest-neighbor hopping evolves stronger, the doublon bands could intersect with scattering bands, the one-dimensional interacting systems display the phases of topological insulators and two-particle bound states in the continuum. For a sufficiently larger nearest-neighbor hopping, the doublon collapse takes place, where both the bulk doublon states and topological doublon edge states become unstable and could dissociate into two weakly interacting bosons. For the mapped two-dimensional single-particle systems, numerical calculations manifest the existence of the topological insulator and topological metal phases with corner states located in only one or two corners.

Title: Vortices and antivortices in antiferroelectric PbZrO3
Authors: Ying Liu, Huazhang Zhang, Konstantin Shapovalov, Ranming Niu, Julie M. Cairney, Xiaozhou Liao, Krystian Roleder, Andrzej Majchrowski, Jordi Arbiol, Philippe Ghosez, Gustau Catalan
Abstract: Although ferroelectric materials are characterised by their parallel arrangement of electric dipoles, in the right boundary conditions these dipoles can reorganize themselves into vortices, antivortices and other non-trivial topological structures. By contrast, little is known about how (or whether) antiferroelectrics, which are materials showing an antiparallel arrangement of electric dipoles, can exhibit vortices or antivortices. In this study, using advanced aberration-corrected scanning transmission electron microscopy, we uncover the existence of atomic-scale (anti)vorticity in ferroelastic domain walls of the archetypal antiferroelectric phase of PbZrO3. The finding is supported, and its underlying physics is explained, using both second-principles simulations based on a deep-learning interatomic potential, and continuum field modelling. This discovery expands the field of chiral topologies into antiferroelectrics.

Title: Exact solution of the relationship between the eigenvalue discreteness and the behavior of eigenstates in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices
Authors: Huitong Wei, Xiumei Wang, Xingping Zhou
Abstract: Eigenstate localization and bulk-boundary correspondence are fundamental phenomena in one-dimensional (1D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) lattices. The eigenvalues discreteness and the eigenstates localization exhibit a high degree of consistency as system information evolve. We explore the relationship between the eigenvalue discreteness and the eigenstates behavior in 1D SSH lattices. The discreteness fraction and the inverse participation ratio (IPR) combined with a Taylor expansion are utilized to describe the relationship. In the Hermitian case, we employ the bulk-edge correspondence and the perturbation theory to derive an exact solution considering both zero and non-zero modes. We also extend our analysis to the non-Hermitian cases, assuming that eigenvalues remain purely real. Our findings reveal a logarithmic relationship between the degree of eigenvalue discreteness and eigenstates localization, which holds under both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian conditions. This result is fully consistent with the theoretical predictions.

Title: The Importance of Pure Dephasing in the Optical Response of Excitons in High-quality van der Waals Heterostructures
Authors: Anabel Atash Kahlon, Matan Meshulam, Tomer Eini, Thomas Poirier, James H. Edgar, Seth Ariel Tongay, Itai Epstein
Abstract: Excitons in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) dominate their optical response due to exceptionally large binding energies arising from their two-dimensional nature. Several theoretical models have been proposed to describe this excitonic behavior, however, it remains unclear which model most accurately captures the underlying physical properties of the response. In this work, we experimentally measure the optical response of high-quality monolayer TMD heterostructures and compare the results with the different theoretical models to address this uncertainty. We find that in high-quality heterostructures, quantum mechanical interactions in the form of pure dephasing plays a dominant role, which has been challenging to isolate experimentally in previous studies. Furthermore, accounting for an additional decay rate to the commonly used radiative and non-radiative rates is found to be important for the accurate description of the excitonic response. These findings establish a robust framework for understanding and predicting the optical properties of TMD-based heterostructures, crucial for both fundamental research and optoelectronic applications.

Title: Enhanced collective vibrations in granular materials
Authors: Shihori Koyama, Norihiro Oyama, Hideyuki Mizuno, Atsushi Ikeda
Abstract: Granular materials are defined as collections of macroscopic dissipative particles. Although these systems are ubiquitous in our lives, the nature and the causes of their non-trivial collective dynamics still remain elusive and have attracted significant interest in non-equilibrium physics. Here, we focus on the vibrational dynamics of granular materials. While the vibrational dynamics of random packings have been examined concerning the jamming transition, previous research has overlooked the role of contact dissipations. We conducted numerical and analytical investigations into the vibrational dynamics of random packings influenced by the normal dissipative force, which is the simplest model for contact dissipations. Our findings reveal that the kinetic energy per mode diverges in the low-frequency range, following the scaling law $\mathcal{K}_l \propto \omega^{-2}_l$ with the frequency $\omega_l$, indicating that low-frequency modes experience strong excitation and that the equipartition of energy is violated. Additionally, the spatial structure factor of the velocity field displays the scaling law $S_v(q) \propto q^{-2}$ with the wavenumber $q$, which signifies that the velocity field has an infinitely long range. We demonstrate that these phenomena arise from the effects of weaker damping on softer modes, where the particle displacements parallel to the contacts are minimal in the low-frequency modes, rendering normal dissipation ineffective at dampening these modes.

Title: Visible-range excitons and electronic structure in $d^0$ double perovskite oxides
Authors: Bhagyashree Behera, Debatri Ash, Urmimala Dey, M. K. Roy, Pritha Patra, K. Annapurna, S. K. Rout, Ajay K Himanshu, Rajyavardhan Ray
Abstract: Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons are present in the visible range in {\it all} the considered so-called wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these exciton modes differ from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a detailed and comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Further, our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.

Title: Microwave-regime demonstration of plasmonic non-reciprocity in a flowing two-dimensional electron gas
Authors: Jingyee Chee, Han Sae Jung, Shannon Harvey, Kenneth West, Loren Pfeiffer, Amir Yacoby, Donhee Ham
Abstract: The speed of a plasmonic wave in the presence of electron drift in a conductor depends on the wave's propagation direction, with the wave traveling along the drift (`forward wave') faster than the wave traveling against the drift (`backward wave'). Phenomena related to this plasmonic non-reciprocity -- which is relatively more pronounced in two-dimensional conductors than in bulk conductors and could lead to solid-state device applications -- have been studied in THz and optical spectral regimes. Here we demonstrate the plasmonic non-reciprocity at microwave frequencies (10 $\sim$ 50 GHz). Concretely, we conduct, at 4K, a microwave network analysis on a gated GaAs two-dimensional electron gas with electron drift (i.e., DC current), directly measuring out forward and backward wave speeds via their propagation phase delays. We resolve, for example, forward and backward wave speeds of $4.26 \times 10^{-3} \pm 8.97 \times 10^{-6}$ (normalized to the speed of light). Sufficient consistency between the electron drift speed obtained from the microwave measurement and that alternatively estimated by a DC transport theory further confirms the non-reciprocity. We conclude this paper with a discussion on how to enhance the non-reciprocity for real-world applications, where degeneracy pressure would play an important role.

Title: Higgs-mode-induced instability and kinetic inductance in strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductors
Authors: Takayuki Kubo
Abstract: A perturbative ac field superposed on a dc bias ($J_b$) is known to excite the Higgs mode in superconductors. The dirty limit, where disorder enhances the Higgs resonance, provides an ideal setting for this study and is also relevant to many superconducting devices operating under strong dc biases. In this paper, we derive a general formula for the complex conductivity of disordered superconductors under an arbitrary dc bias using the Keldysh-Usadel theory of nonequilibrium superconductivity. This formula is relatively simple, making it more accessible to a broader research community. Our analysis reveals that in a strongly dc-biased dirty-limit superconductor, the Higgs mode induces an instability in the homogeneous superflow within a specific frequency window, making the high-current-carrying state vulnerable to ac perturbations. This instability, which occurs exclusively in the ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ configuration, leads to a non-monotonic dependence of kinetic inductance on frequency and bias strength. By carefully tuning the dc bias and the frequency of the ac perturbation, the kinetic inductance can be enhanced by nearly two orders of magnitude. In the weak dc bias regime, our formula recovers the well-known quadratic dependence, $L_k \propto 1+ C(J_b/J_{\rm dp})^2$, with coefficients $C=0.409$ for ${\rm ac} \parallel {\rm dc}$ and $C=0.136$ for ${\rm ac} \perp {\rm dc}$, where $J_{\rm dp}$ is the equilibrium depairing current density. These findings establish a robust theoretical framework for dc-biased superconducting systems and suggest that Higgs mode physics could be exploited in the design and optimization of superconducting detectors. Moreover, they may lead to a yet-to-be-explored detector concept based on Higgs mode physics.

Title: High pressure structural and lattice dynamics study of {\alpha}-In$_2$Se$_3$
Authors: Shiyu Feng, Baihong Sun, Wenting Lu, Haikai Zou, Chenxin Wei, Qian Zhang, Bihan Wang, Martin Kunz, Hirokazu Kadobayashi, Azkar Saeed Ahmad, Elad Koren, Elissaios Stavrou
Abstract: Layered $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$has been studied using a concomitant in-situ synchrotron angle dispersive powder x-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy study in a diamond anvil cell up to 60+ GPa, at room temperature. Helium, that remains fairly hydrostatic up to the highest pressure in this study, was used as the pressure-transmitting medium. The results from both experimental methods reveal a pressure-induced structural phase transition from $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ to a monoclinic $\beta$'-In2Se3 structure at $\approx$1 GPa, in agreement with previous studies. Based on our detailed measurements using both experimental techniques and F-f formalism, the $\beta$'-In$_2$Se$_3$ structure remains stable up to 45 GPa, without a clear indication of a phase transition towards the previously reported $\beta$-In2Se3 phase. Above this pressure, In$_2$Se$_3$ adopts a disordered solid-solution-like orthorhombic structure, phase IV. The results are discussed in comparison with the relevant previous studies of $\alpha$-In$_2$Se$_3$ under pressure.

Title: Giant Electro-Viscous Effects in Polar Fluids with Paraelectric-Modulated Antiferroelectric-Ferroelectric Phase Sequence
Authors: Hiroya Nishikawa, Péter Salamon, Marcell Tibor Máthé, Antal Jákli, Fumito Araoka
Abstract: The recently discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid-crystal material DIO exhibits an antiferroelectric (AF) phase, characterized by a sinusoidally modulated structure between the paraelectric (P) and ferroelectric (F) nematic phases. Although these sinusoidal modulated structures associated with the P-AF-F phase sequence is commonly observed in solid ferroelectrics, their presence in soft matter systems is scarce. This study is aimed at examining the macroscopic properties of DIO, identifying unique rheological properties, such as switching between shear thinning and shear thickening behaviors at certain shear rate in the ferroelectric nematic phase. Additionally, a significant electroviscous effect is observed, with the viscosity increasing by 70 times under an ultra-low electric field of 0.15 V um-1 at the AF-F transition.

Title: Symmetry breaking in Prussian Blue Analogues via growth--guided local ordering of hexacyanometallate vacancies
Authors: Yevheniia Kholina, Thomas Weber, Joohee Bang, Arthur Baroni, Marianne Liebi, Semen Gorfman, Ido Biran, Mark Warren, Dmitriy Chernyshov, Arkadiy Simonov
Abstract: We report Growth--Guided Local Ordering, a novel mechanism of symmetry reduction in disordered crystals. This mechanism operates through the directional ordering of point defects during crystal growth, where defect correlations develop preferentially along the growth direction, resulting in reduced symmetry that persists in the final structure through the spatial distribution of defects. We demonstrate this phenomenon in Mn[Co]-Prussian Blue Analogues, disordered cyanide crystals containing numerous Co(CN)$_6$ vacancies. Single crystal diffuse scattering reveals pronounced anisotropy in vacancy distribution: strong correlations along [001] growth direction contrast with weak correlations perpendicular to it. This local ordering reduces the Laue symmetry to tetragonal $4/mmm$, evident in properties such as birefringence, while the average structure retains cubic $m\bar 3m$ symmetry. When growth proceeds along [111] direction, the same mechanism produces domains with trigonal symmetry. Because this mechanism relies on fundamental aspects of crystal growth rather than specific material properties, it offers a general strategy for symmetry control in disordered crystals. Crucially, it transforms the complex task of altering crystal symmetry into the more manageable challenge of controlling growth direction, achievable through various established techniques such as the use of surfactants during crystallization.

Title: Various Architectures of Colloidal Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9; Thermal Stability, Photoluminescence and Magnetic Properties of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 Nanosheets
Authors: Azam Bayat, Ali Reza Mahjoub, Mostafa M. Amini
Abstract: The lindgrenite compounds [Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2] with various architectures and high crystallinity were prepared by a simple surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method. Then, the Cu3Mo2O9 samples were prepared by calcination of the as-synthesized Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2. The resulting samples have high crystallinity, colloidal properties, high-yield, large-scale production capability with using of nontoxic and inexpensive reagents and water as an environmentally solvent. The scanning electron microscope studies show that the as-prepared lindgrenite nanostructures are well crystallized with rod, sheet and hollow sphere morphologies. Meanwhile, the photoluminescence and magnetic properties of the nanosheet samples have been investigated that the both of Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 samples have super paramagnetic behavior at room temperature and in comparison with previous works, Cu3(MoO4)2(OH)2 and Cu3Mo2O9 samples synthesized by the surfactant-assisted hydrothermal method in this work have a very obvious red-shifted PL emission and high intensity.

Title: Electric field control of nonlinear Hall effect in Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4
Authors: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Shuo Wang, Feng Li, Ping Liu, Shuang Zhou, Yong Pu
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE), as an important probe to reveal the symmetry breaking in topological properties of materials, opens up a new dimension for exploring the energy band structure and electron transport mechanism of quantum materials. Current studies mainly focus on the observation of material intrinsic the NLHE or inducing the NLHE response by artificially constructing corrugated/twisted twodimensionalmaterial systems. Notably, the modulation of NLHE signal strength, a core parameter of device performance, has attracted much attention, while theoretical predictions suggest that an applied electric field can achieve the NLHE enhancement through modulation of the Berry curvature dipole (BCD). Here we report effective modulation the magnitude and sign of the NLHE by applying additional constant electric fields of different directions and magnitudes in the semimetal TaIrTe4. The NLHE response strength is enhanced by 168 times compared to the intrinsic one at 4 K when the additional constant electric field of -0.5 kV/cm is applied to the b-axis of TaIrTe4 and the through a.c. current is parallel to the TaIrTe4 a-axis. Scaling law analysis suggests that the enhancement may be the result of the combined effect of the electric field on the intrinsic BCD and disorder scattering effect of TaIrTe4. This work provides a means to study the properties of TaIrTe4, as well as a valuable reference for the study of novel electronic devices.

Title: Hopfield model with quasi-diagonal connection matrix
Authors: Leonid Litinskii
Abstract: We analyze a Hopfield neural network with a quasi-diagonal connection matrix. We use the term "quasi-diagonal matrix" to denote a matrix with all elements equal zero except the elements on the first super- and sub-diagonals of the principle diagonal. The nonzero elements are arbitrary real numbers. Such matrix generalizes the well-known connection matrix of the one dimensional Ising model with open boundary conditions where all nonzero elements equal +1. We present a simple description of the fixed points of the Hopfield neural network and their dependence on the matrix elements. The obtained results also allow us to analyze the cases of a) the nonzero elements constitute arbitrary super- and sub-diagonals and b) periodic boundary conditions.

Title: Thermodynamic Cost of Steady State Erasure
Authors: Deepak Gupta, Kristian Stølevik Olsen, Supriya Krishnamurthy
Abstract: Recent experiments have implemented resetting by means of a time-varying external harmonic trap whereby the trap stiffness is changed from an initial to a final value in finite-time and then the system is reset when it relaxes to an equilibrium distribution in the final trap. Such setups are very similar to those studied in the context of the finite-time Landauer erasure principle. We analyse the thermodynamic costs of such a setup by deriving a moment generating function for the work cost of changing the trap stiffness in finite-time for a system in steady state. We analyse the mean and variance of the work required for a specific experimentally viable protocol and also obtain an optimal protocol which minimises the mean cost. For both these procedures, our analysis captures both the large-time and short-time corrections. For the optimal protocol, we obtain a closed form expression for the mean cost for all protocol durations, thereby making contact with earlier work on geometric measures of dissipation-minimising optimal protocols that implement information erasure.

Title: An ideal entropy transporter with finite power and vanishing fluctuation
Authors: Mingnan Ding, Jun Wu, Xiangjun Xing
Abstract: We study a micro-magnet that interacts with a spin-polarized electric current, a heat bath, as well as a static magnetic field. The resulting non-equilibrium steady-state transports entropy between the current and the heat bath, without need of any thermodynamic force. In the limit of strong magnetic field, both the entropy production rate and the fluctuation of entropy transport become vanishingly small, whereas the average rate of entropy transport remains finite. Our results demonstrate that there is no fundamental limitation on the performance of thermodynamic engines other than the first and second laws of thermodynamics.

Title: Tailoring the normal and superconducting state properties of ternary scandium tellurides, Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M = $ Fe, Ru and Ir) through chemical substitution

Abstract: The pursuit of a unifying theory for non-BCS superconductivity has faced significant challenges. One approach to overcome such challenges is to perform systematic investigations into superconductors containing \textit{d}-electron metals in order to elucidate their underlying mechanisms. Recently, the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ ($M$ = d-electron metal) family has emerged as a unique series of isostructural compounds exhibiting superconductivity across a range of $3d$, $4d$, and $5d$ electron systems. In this study, we employ muon spin rotation, neutron diffraction, and magnetisation techniques to probe the normal and superconducting states at a microscopic level. Our findings reveal extremely dilute superfluid densities that correlate with the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$). Additionally, we identify high-temperature normal-state transitions that are inversely correlated with $T_\mathrm{c}$. Notably, in Sc$_6$FeTe$_2$, the superconducting pairing symmetry is most likely characterised by two nodeless gaps, one of which closes as electron correlations diminish in the Ru and Ir Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds. These results classify the Sc$_6M$Te$_2$ compounds ($M$ = Fe, Ru, Ir) as unconventional bulk superconductors, where the normal-state transitions and superconducting properties are governed by the interplay between electron correlations and spin-orbit coupling of the d-electron metal.

Title: Allegro-FM: Towards Equivariant Foundation Model for Exascale Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Ken-ichi Nomura, Shinnosuke Hattori, Satoshi Ohmura, Ikumi Kanemasu, Kohei Shimamura, Nabankur Dasgupta, Aiichiro Nakano, Rajiv K. Kalia, Priya Vashishta
Abstract: We present a foundation model for exascale molecular dynamics simulations by leveraging an E(3) equivariant network architecture (Allegro) and a set of large-scale organic and inorganic materials datasets merged by Total Energy Alignment (TEA) framework. Thanks to the large-scale training sets, the obtained model (Allegro-FM) is versatile for various materials simulations for diverse downstream tasks covering 89 elements in the periodic table. Allegro-FM exhibits excellent agreements with high-level quantum chemistry theories in describing structural, mechanical, and thermodynamic properties, while exhibiting emergent capabilities for structural correlations, reaction kinetics, mechanical strengths, fracture, and solid/liquid dissolution, for which the model has not been trained. Furthermore, we demonstrate the robust predictability and generalizability of Allegro-FM for chemical reactions using the transition1x that consists of 9.1 million transition state data, as well as calcium silicate hydrates as a testbed. With its computationally efficient, strictly-local network architecture, Allegro-FM scales up to multi-billion-atom systems with a parallel efficiency of 0.964 on the exaflop/s Aurora supercomputer at Argonne Leadership Computing Facility. The approach presented in this work demonstrates the potential of the foundation model for a novel materials design and discovery based on large-scale atomistic simulations.

Title: Effects of particle angularity on granular self-organization
Authors: Dominik Krengel, Haoran Jiang, Takashi Matsushima, Raphael Blumenfeld
Abstract: Recent studies of two-dimensional poly-disperse disc systems revealed a coordinated self-organisation of cell stresses and shapes, with certain distributions collapsing onto a master form for many processes, size distributions, friction coefficients, and cell orders. Here we examine the effects of grain angularity on the indicators of self-organisation, using simulations of bi-disperse regular $N$-polygons and varying $N$ systematically. We find that: the strong correlation between local cell stresses and orientations, as well as the collapses of the conditional distributions of scaled cell stress ratios to a master Weibull form for all cell orders $k$, are independent of angularity and friction coefficient. In contrast, increasing angularity makes the collapses of the conditional distributions sensitive to changes in the friction coefficient.

Title: Quantum Turbulence Across Dimensions: Crossover from two- to three-dimension
Authors: Weican Yang, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic transition of quantum turbulence (QT) in a confined potential field as the system evolves from purely two-dimensional (2D) to quasi-two-dimensional, and ultimately to three-dimensional (3D), by fixing the lateral dimensions of the trapping box while varying its height. In the 2DQT, distinct Onsager vortex cluster formation and inverse energy cascade are observed, while 3DQT exhibits a direct energy cascade consistent with the Vinen turbulence decay rate, which display striking differences. By systematically altering the system height, we explore how dimensionality drives the differentiation of turbulence types and find that this transition is closely related to the excitation of Kelvin waves. Kelvin waves not only introduce additional dissipation mechanisms but also serve as mediators for direct energy transfer across scales. When the wavelength of the permitted Kelvin waves exceeds the critical size of vortex clusters, turbulence begins transitioning to 3D type, culminating in fully developed 3DQT at the characteristic scale. In the transitional region, we observe continuous variations in the decay rate and vortex cluster correlation functions.

Title: Universality and Crossovers for Quantum-Criticality in 2d metals
Authors: Chandra M. Varma
Abstract: A simple generalization of the theory of crossovers in classical-criticality to quantum-criticality gives that, a Heisenberg model with a small anisotropy favoring planar order has a cross-over towards the fixed point of the xy model in the temperature direction which is very rapid compared to those in the orthogonal directions, if the temporal correlation length is much larger than the spatial correlation length, i.e. for a large dynamic exponent $z$. At the other end of the flow, the stability of the fixed point of the quantum xy model coupled to fermions is exponentially enhanced in the temperature direction. This is used to explain why the quantum-critical fluctuations of all measured 2d anti-ferromagnetic compounds - cuprates, heavy-fermion and Fe-based metals shows the characteristic fluctuations of the quantum xy model, and have the same anomalous transport and thermodynamic properties as the cuprates and twisted WSe$_2$ and Graphene. We segue briefly to the range of extended quantum-criticality due to disorder by generalizing the Harris criteria as well, using the properties of the quantum xy model. The observed $T \ln T$ specific heat at criticality is derived quite simply using the same methods which derive the cross-overs. This paper is written for the commemoration volume for Jan Zaanen whom I knew very well, starting from his days as a post-doc at Bell labs to his career as a distinguished Professor at Leiden.

Title: Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of trajectory observables and entropy production, where the uncertainty in observables is quantified by their variance. In the context of information theory, uncertainty is often evaluated in terms of Shannon entropy, but it remains unclear whether there is a quantitative relation between Shannon entropy of the observables and entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we show that uncertainty relations can be formulated with observable Shannon entropy and entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution demands higher entropy production. This Letter elucidates the role of Shannon entropy of observables within stochastic thermodynamics, thereby establishing a foundation for deriving new uncertainty relations.

Title: Identification of metastable lattice distortion free charge density wave at photoinduced interface via TRARPES
Authors: Shaofeng Duan, Binshuo Zhang, Zihao Wang, Shichong Wang, Lingxiao Gu, Haoran Liu, Jiongyu Huang, Jianzhe Liu, Dong Qian, Yanfeng Guo, Wentao Zhang
Abstract: The interplay between different degrees of freedom governs the emergence of correlated electronic states in quantum materials, with charge density waves (CDW) often coexisting with other exotic phases. Under thermal equilibrium, traditional CDW states are consequentially accompanied by structural phase transitions. In contrast, ultrafast photoexcitation allows access to exotic states where a single degree of freedom dominates in the time domain, enabling the study of underlying physics without interference. Here, we report the realization of a long-lived metastable CDW state without lattice distortion at the photoinduced interfaces in GdTe3 using time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. After optical excitation above the CDW melting threshold, we identified emerged metastable interfaces through inverting the CDW-coupled lattice distortions, with lifetimes on the order of 10 picoseconds. These photoinduced interfaces represent a novel CDW state lacking the usual amplitude mode and lattice distortions, allowing quantification of the dominant role of electronic instabilities in CDW order. This work provides a new approach to disentangling electronic instabilities from electron-phonon coupling using a nonequilibrium method.

Title: Enhanced diffusion over a periodic trap by hydrodynamic coupling to an elastic mode
Authors: Juliette Lacherez (LOMA), Maxime Lavaud (LOMA), Yacine Amarouchene (LOMA), David S. Dean (LOMA), Thomas Salez (LOMA)
Abstract: In many physical systems, degrees of freedom are coupled \emph{via} hydrodynamic forces, even in the absence of Hamiltonian interactions. A particularly important and widespread example concerns the transport of microscopic particles in fluids near deformable boundaries. In such a situation, the influence of elastohydrodynamic couplings on Brownian motion remains to be understood. Unfortunately, the temporal and spatial scales associated with the thermal fluctuations of usual surfaces are often so small that their deformations are difficult to monitor experimentally, together with the much slower and larger particle motion at stake. Here, we propose a minimal model describing the hydrodynamic coupling of a colloidal particle to a fluctuating elastic mode, in presence of an external periodic potential. We demonstrate that the late-time diffusion coefficient of the particle increases with the compliance of the elastic mode. Remarkably,  our results reveal that, and quantify how: i) spontaneous microscopic transport in complex environnements can be affected by soft boundaries -- a situation with numerous practical implications in nanoscale and biological physics; ii) the effects of fast and tiny surface deformations are imprinted over the long-term and large-distance colloidal mobility -- and are hence measurable in practice.

Title: Investigation of Fe-Ag and Ag-Fe Interfaces in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayer Using Nuclear Resonance Scattering under X-ray Standing Wave Conditions
Authors: Manisha Priyadarsini, Sharanjeet Singh, Ilya Sergeev, Olaf Leupold, Ajay Gupta, Dileep Kumar
Abstract: Understanding the interfaces of layered nanostructures is key to optimizing their structural and magnetic properties for the desired functionality. In the present work, the two interfaces of a few nm thick Fe layer in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayers are studied with a depth resolution of a fraction of a nanometer using x-ray standing waves (XSWs) generated by an underlying [W-Si]x10 multilayer (MLT) at an x-ray incident angle around the Bragg peak of the MLT. Interface selectivity in Ag-57Fe-Ag trilayers was achieved by moving XSW antinodes across the interfaces by optimizing suitable incident angles and performing depth-resolved nuclear resonance scattering (NRS) and X-ray fluorescence (XRF) measurements for magnetic and structural properties. The combined analysis revealed that the rms roughness of 57Fe-on-Ag and Ag-on-57Fe interfaces are not equal. The roughness of the 57Fe-on-Ag interface is 10 Angstrom, while that of the Ag-on-57Fe interface is 6 Angstrom. 57Fe isotope sensitive NRS revealed that hyperfine field (HFF) at both interfaces of 57Fe-on-Ag and Ag-on-57Fe interfaces are distinct, which is consistent with the difference in interface roughnesses measured as root mean square (RMS) roughness. Thermal annealing induces 57Fe diffusion into the Ag layer, and annealing at 325 C transforms the sample into a paramagnetic state. This behavior is attributed to forming 57Fe nanoparticles within the Ag matrix, exhibiting a paramagnetic nature. These findings provide deep insights into interface properties crucial for developing advanced nanostructures and spintronic devices.

Title: Nonanalytic Landau functionals shaping the finite-size scaling of fluctuations and response functions in and out of equilibrium
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Landau theory relates phase transitions to the minimization of the Landau functional (e.g., free energy functional), which is expressed as a power series of the order parameter. It has been shown that the critical behavior of certain physical systems can be described using Landau functionals that include nonanalytic terms, corresponding to odd or even noninteger powers of the absolute value of the order parameter. In particular, these nonanalytic terms can determine the order of the phase transition and the values of the critical exponents. Here, we show that such terms can also shape the finite-size scaling behavior of fluctuations of observables (e.g., of energy or magnetization) or the response functions (e.g., heat capacity or magnetic susceptibility) at the continuous phase transition point. We demonstrate this on two examples, the equilibrium molecular zipper and the nonequilibrium version of the Curie--Weiss model.

Title: Observation of a $Pbca$ phase and robust metallicity in $\rm{RuO_2}$ under pressure
Authors: He Zhang, Xudong Wei, Wei Zhong, Xiaoli Ma, Liyunxiao Wu, Jie Zhou, Saori Kawaguchi, Hirokazu Kadobayashi, Zhenxiang Cheng, Guoying Gao, Xiaohui Yu, Ho-kwang Mao, Binbin Yue, Fang Hong
Abstract: $\rm{RuO_2}$ stands as a quintessential rutile-type compound under ambient conditions, with its structural exploration under pressure bearing significant implications for both phase transition investigations and Earth science. Nonetheless, the precise phase transition sequence remains a debate. In this study, we disclose the emergence of the $Pbca$ phase alongside the enduring metallic character of $\rm{RuO_2}$ under megabar pressure. Employing state-of-the-art synchrotron X-ray diffraction, our observations delineate a phase transition trajectory progressing through rutile, $\rm{CaCl_2}$, and ultimately $Pbca$ phases. Notably, the $Pbca$ phase manifests immediately just after the rutile-$\rm{CaCl_2}$ transition, confining a narrow pressure regime for the pure $\rm{CaCl_2}$-type phase. Within the pressure range of 15.5 to 35.0 GPa, a coexistence of the $\rm{CaCl_2}$-type and $Pbca$ phases is observed, transforming to a sole presence of the $Pbca$ phase beyond 35.0 GPa. Electrical transport measurements conducted on both single crystal and powder samples confirm the enduring metallic conductivity of $\rm{RuO_2}$, persisting up to at least $\sim$120 GPa, albeit exhibiting a diminished conductivity at ultrahigh pressures due to a reduction in electronic density of states at the Fermi level. This study furnishes compelling evidence for the presence of the $Pbca$ phase across a broad pressure range, diverging from the previously widely acknowledged $Pa\bar{3}$ phase, thereby offering crucial insights into phase transition phenomena in other metal dioxides and advancing our comprehension of electronic behaviors within 4d and 5d electron systems.

Title: Unveiling Optimal Diffusion for Infection Control in Brownian Particle Systems
Authors: Kaito Takahashi, Makiko Sasada, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: Understanding the spread of infectious diseases requires integrating movement and interaction dynamics into epidemiological models. In this study, we investigate the role of particle diffusivity and physical constraints in shaping infection dynamics within a system of Brownian particles. Through numerical simulations and theoretical analyses, we uncover a nontrivial relationship between diffusivity and infection speed: an optimal diffusion coefficient exists that minimizes the infection spreading speed. This counterintuitive result arises from a balance between particle mixing and interaction frequency. The optimal diffusivity is observed in both interacting and non-interacting systems when the infection radius exceeds the mean lattice spacing and the initial configuration is out of equilibrium. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the spread of infections in confined and diffusive environments, with potential implications for designing movement-based strategies for infection control.

Title: Self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion
Authors: Bohan Lyu, Jie Lin
Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.

Title: Even denominator fractional quantum Hall states in the zeroth Landau level of monolayer-like band of ABA trilayer graphene
Authors: Tanima Chanda, Simrandeep Kaur, Harsimran Singh, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Manish Jain, Udit Khanna, Ajit C. Balram, Aveek Bid
Abstract: The fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is a macroscopic manifestation of strong electron-electron interactions. Even denominator FQH states (FQHSs) at half-filling are particularly interesting as they are predicted to host non-Abelian excitations with non-trivial braiding statistics. Such states are predominantly observed in the $N=1$ Landau level (LL) of semiconductors such as GaAs. In this Letter, we report the unanticipated observation of even-denominator FQHSs in the $N=0$ LL of ABA trilayer graphene (TLG), a system characterized by tunable LL mixing and the absence of inversion symmetry. Notably, we find robust FQHSs at $\nu=5/2$ and $\nu=7/2$ when two LLs, originating from a monolayer-like band of TLG with different isospin indices, cross each other. These are flanked by the Levin-Halperin daughter states at $\nu=7/13$ and $\nu=9/17$, respectively, and further away, the standard series of Jain-sequence of composite fermions (CFs) is observed. The even-denominator FQHSs and their accompanying daughter states become stronger with increasing magnetic fields, while concomitantly, a weakening of the CF states is observed. We posit that the absence of inversion symmetry in the system gives rise to additional isospin interactions, which enhance LL mixing and soften the short-range part of the Coulomb repulsion, stabilizing the even-denominator FQHSs. In addition, we demonstrate that these states, along with their daughter states, can be finely tuned with an external displacement field that serves as an important tool to control the LL mixing in the system.

Title: Observation of Coherent Quantum Tunneling of a Massive Atomic Cluster with 435 u
Authors: Han Zhang, Yong-Kui Wang, Yi Zheng, Hai-Tao Bai, Bing Yang
Abstract: Tunneling is a genuine quantum phenomenon typically observed in low-mass particles such as electrons. However, it fades rapidly as mass increases due to the exponential decay of the matter-wave penetration depth. Cooling atoms to nanokelvin temperatures enhances their matter wave characteristics. Here, we report the observation of coherent quantum tunneling of a bonded cluster composed of 5 ultracold rubidium-87 atoms, collectively forming a massive object of 435 u. Using a double-well superlattice, integer occupancy states are prepared, with atoms bonded via strong on-site interactions. We demonstrate that the exponential base of tunneling strength can be tuned to approach unity, drastically reducing its decay for heavier masses and enabling a scalable strategy. Moreover, tunneling is harnessed to create spatially separated Schrödinger-cat states (~320 nm apart), achieving quantum enhancement in measurements. This work markedly raises the mass threshold for quantum tunneling and paves the way for quantum metrology with massive particles.

Title: Dynamical Spreading Under Power Law Potential
Authors: Ido Fanto, Yuval Rosenblum, Ori Harel, Naomi Oppenheimer
Abstract: We investigate the dynamic spreading of a dense suspension of particles under power law repulsive potentials decaying as $1/r^k$. We find analytically that the particles spread in a self-similar form, where the radius grows with time as $t^{1/(k+2)}$. Our results closely align with experiments of paramagnetic colloidal particles under an external magnetic field interacting via a $1/r^3$ potential. We further substantiate the theory by molecular dynamic simulations of thousands of particles in one and two dimensions. The simulations reveal a rich diversity of behaviors contingent on the value of $k$. Specifically, for $k>D-2$ (where $D$ is the dimension), the density is centered in the middle, for $k = D-2$, density is uniform, and for $k<D-2$, there is an aggregation of particles at the edge of the suspension. When two or more such suspensions are placed near each other, the system retains a power-law memory of its initial state, resulting in a particle-free zone at the interface of the merging populations.

Title: Chiral Raman coupling for spin-orbit coupling in ultracold atomic gases
Authors: Biao Shan, Lianghui Huang, Yuhang Zhao, Guoqi Bian, Pengjun Wang, Wei Han, Jing Zhang
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) in ultracold atoms is engineered by light-atom interaction, such as two-photon Raman transitions between two Zeeman spin states. In this work, we propose and experimentally realize chiral Raman coupling to generate SOC in ultracold atomic gases, which exhibits high quantization axis direction-dependence. Chiral Raman coupling for SOC is created by chiral light-atom interaction, in which a circularly polarized electromagnetic field generated by two Raman lasers interacts with two Zeeman spin states $\delta m_{F}=\pm 1$ (chiral transition). We present a simple scheme of chiral one-dimension (1D) Raman coupling by employing two Raman lasers at an intersecting angle 90$^{\circ}$ with the proper polarization configuration. In this case, Raman coupling for SOC exist in one direction of the magnetic quantization axis and disappears in the opposite direction. Then we extend this scheme into a chiral 2D optical square Raman lattice configuration to generate the 1D SOC. There are two orthogonal 1D SOC, which exists in the positive and negative directions of the magnetic quantization axis respectively. This case is compared with 2D SOC based on the nonchiral 2D optical Raman lattice scheme for studying the topological energy band. This work broadens the horizon for understanding chiral physics and simulating topological quantum systems.

Title: Transmission through rectangular potentials in semimetals featuring quadratic dispersion
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We revisit the problem of transmission of quasiparticles through a rectangular potential barrier for semimetals featuring quadratic-in-momentum band-crossings at a nodal point. Although this was considered in Annals of Physics 419 (2020) 168235, the solutions corresponding to evanescent waves were missed, leading to a partial fulfillment of the boundary conditions required to determine the piecewise-continuous wavefunctions. In this paper, our aim is to correct those shortcomings, recompute the transmission coefficients, and show the resulting behaviour of the conductivity and the Fano factor for some representative parameter values.

Title: Fermion mediated pairing in the Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida to Efimov transition regime
Authors: Geyue Cai, Henry Ando, Sarah McCusker, Cheng Chin
Abstract: The Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yoshida (RKKY) interaction and Efimov physics are two distinct quantum phenomena in condensed matter and nuclear physics, respectively. The RKKY interaction describes correlations between impurities mediated by an electron gas, while Efimov physics describes universal bound states of three particles with resonant interactions. Recently, both effects have been observed in Bose-Fermi mixtures in the weak and resonant interaction regimes, respectively. Intriguing conjectures exist to elucidate how the two phenomena meet in the transition regime where the mixture is strongly interacting. In this work, we explore the RKKY-Efimov transition in a mixture of bosonic Cs-133 and fermionic Li-6 near a tunable interspecies Feshbach resonance. From dispersion and relaxation measurements, we find that the transition is highlighted by a fermion-mediated scattering resonance between Cs atoms and a weaker resonance on Li atoms. These resonances represent reactive scattering of Cs and Li atoms in the many-body regime, which reduces to an Efimov resonance in the thermal gas regime. Our observation demonstrates the intriguing interplay of two-, three-, and many-body physics in an Bose-Fermi mixture that connects condensed matter physics, nuclear physics and quantum many-body chemistry.

Title: Rheologically tuned modes of collective transport in active viscoelastic films
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: While many living biological media combine both viscous and elastic properties, most theoretical studies employ either purely fluid- or solid-like descriptions. We here use a unified framework for active films on substrates capable of describing a broad range of viscoelastic behavior to explore the interplay between activity and rheology. The core of the study is a comprehensive state diagram showing a rich world of spatiotemporal dynamic states. Our results demonstrate the potential of tunable rheology to realize modes of controlled active transport on the microscale.

Title: Dynamics and clustering of sedimenting disc lattices
Authors: Harshit Joshi, Rahul Chajwa, Sriram Ramaswamy, Narayanan Menon, Rama Govindarajan
Abstract: Uniform arrays of particles tend to cluster as they sediment in viscous fluids. Shape anisotropy of the particles enriches these dynamics by modifying the mode-structure and the resulting instabilities of the array. A one-dimensional lattice of sedimenting spheroids in the Stokesian regime displays either an exponential or an algebraic rate of clustering depending on the initial lattice spacing (Chajwa et al. 2020). This is caused by an interplay between the Crowley mechanism which promotes clumping, and a shape-induced drift mechanism which subdues it. We theoretically and experimentally investigate the sedimentation dynamics of one-dimensional lattices of oblate spheroids or discs and show a stark difference in clustering behaviour: the Crowley mechanism results in clumps comprised of several spheroids, whereas the drift mechanism results in pairs of spheroids whose asymptotic behavior is determined by pair-hydrodynamic interactions. We find that a Stokeslet, or point-particle, approximation is insufficient to accurately describe the instability and that the corrections provided by the first-reflection are necessary for obtaining some crucial dynamical features. As opposed to a sharp boundary between exponential growth and neutral eigenvalues under the Stokeslet approximation, the first-reflection correction leads to exponential growth for all initial perturbations, but far more rapid algebraic growth than exponential growth at large lattice spacing $d$. For discs with aspect ratio 0.125, corresponding to the experimental value, the instability growth rate is found to decrease with increasing lattice spacing $d$, approximately as $d^{-4.5}$, which is faster than the $d^{-2}$ for spheres (Crowley, 1971). Sedimenting pairs predominantly come together to form '$\perp$', which our theory accounts for through an analysis that builds on Koch & Shaqfeh (1989).

Title: Oscillatory collective motion in viscoelastic and elastic active fluids and solids under circular confinement
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: In an inspiring recent study, Xu et al. [Nat. Phys. 19, 46 (2023)] observed for a living active biofilm under circular confinement two emergent dynamic modes of collective motion in the film. One corresponds to global rotational motion of oscillating sense of rotation, the other one to uniformly translating motion of rotating migration direction. The authors reproduced these features in a discretized theoretical model for elastic active solids. We here demonstrate that the discovered fundamental phenomena are generic and emerge abundantly for a broad range of viscoelastic fluids and solids. Elastic solids represent only one limiting case.

Title: A physics-based data-driven model for CO$_2$ gas diffusion electrodes to drive automated laboratories
Authors: Ivan Grega, Félix Therrien, Abhishek Soni, Karry Ocean, Kevan Dettelbach, Ribwar Ahmadi, Mehrdad Mokhtari, Curtis P. Berlinguette, Yoshua Bengio
Abstract: The electrochemical reduction of atmospheric CO$_2$ into high-energy molecules with renewable energy is a promising avenue for energy storage that can take advantage of existing infrastructure especially in areas where sustainable alternatives to fossil fuels do not exist. Automated laboratories are currently being developed and used to optimize the composition and operating conditions of gas diffusion electrodes (GDEs), the device in which this reaction takes place. Improving the efficiency of GDEs is crucial for this technology to become viable. Here we present a modeling framework to efficiently explore the high-dimensional parameter space of GDE designs in an active learning context. At the core of the framework is an uncertainty-aware physics model calibrated with experimental data. The model has the flexibility to capture various input parameter spaces and any carbon products which can be modeled with Tafel kinetics. It is interpretable, and a Gaussian process layer can capture deviations of real data from the function space of the physical model itself. We deploy the model in a simulated active learning setup with real electrochemical data gathered by the AdaCarbon automated laboratory and show that it can be used to efficiently traverse the multi-dimensional parameter space.

Title: Engineering of electronic and magnetic modulations in gradient functional oxide heterostructures
Authors: Leonard Schüler, Yannik Sievert, Vladimir Roddatis, Ulrich Ross, Vladimir Moshnyaga, Fryderyk Lyzwa
Abstract: Advanced interface engineering provides a way to control the ground state of correlated oxide heterostructures, which enables the shaping of future electronic and magnetic nanodevices with enhanced performance. An especially promising and rather new avenue is to find and explore low-dimensional phases of structural, ferroic and superconducting origin. In this multimodal study, we present a novel dynamic growth control method that enables synthesizing compositionally graded superlattices (SLs) of (LaMnO_3)_10/(SrMnO_3)_10 (LMO/SMO), in which the layers gradually change their composition between LMO and SMO with gradient G values ranging from 0 to 100 %. This leads to strong modulations in the material's electronic properties and of the two-phase ferromagnetic (FM) behavior. In particular, we observe that G has almost no impact on the emergent high-temperature FM phase; in contrast, the low-temperature volume-like FM phase increases drastically with higher G-factors and thus can serve as a precise marker for chemical composition on a nanoscale. Focusing on the interfacial charge transfer found at sharp SMO/LMO interfaces (G=0), we observe that for higher G-factors a long-range charge modulation develops, which is accompanied by an insulator-to-metal transition. These findings showcase G as a crucial control parameter that can shape the superlattice's intrinsic properties and provide a perspective for designing functional oxide heterostructures with artificially disordered interfaces.

Title: Flat-Band Driven Kondo Breakdown and Reentrant Effects in Heavy-Fermion Moir\'{e} Superlattices
Authors: Fabian Eickhoff, Jian-Xin Zhu, Benedikt Fauseweh
Abstract: Moiré superlattices (MSLs) in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures have demonstrated their incredible power in driving emergent electronic phenomena, some of which are reminiscent of those usually only observed in bulk strongly correlated quantum materials. With the recent discovery of van der Waals $f$-electron materials, the design of novel MSLs of intrinsic strong correlation is now within the reach. Here we study the novel electron phases of two-dimensional heavy-fermion MSL with increasingly diluted f-electron local moments. By applying dynamical mean field theory (DMFT) with numerical renormalization group (NRG) as an impurity solver, we demonstrate the appearance of a new energy scale and a re-entrant Kondo breakdown in connection with the emergence of a flat band in the system. We further compare our numerical findings with predictions derived from the Lieb-Mattis theorem and show the necessity of the new energy scale to consistently reconcile the predictions with the conventional single-impurity limit for exceedingly large unit cells.

Title: The First Principles Equation for Coherent Phonons: Dynamics and Polaron distortions
Authors: Gianluca Stefanucci, Enrico Perfetto
Abstract: This paper addresses the first principles description of coherent phonons in systems subjected to optical excitations and/or doping. We reformulate the first-principles Ehrenfest equation (fpEE) [Phys. Rev. X {\bf 13}, 031026 (2023)] in terms of Born-Oppenheimer phonon frequencies and identify key simplifications that lead to current models. Our main findings are that the conventional equation of motion for coherent phonons needs revision, as it does not arise from the fpEE, and that the $e$-$ph$ coupling should be replaced by an unconventional dynamically screened coupling. The fpEE is also used to develop a first-principles polaron theory of lattice distortions.

Title: Silica Aerogel Thin Film on Improving Solar Cell Efficiency
Authors: Yan Che
Abstract: Silica aerogels are nanoporous materials with exceptional optical and physical properties, making them promising candidates to enhance solar cell efficiency as antireflective coatings. This study synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogel thin films under ambient conditions and characterized their porous structure, surface morphology, and optical performance. The films were deposited on monocrystalline silicon solar cells to assess their impact on photovoltaic properties. A two-step acid/base catalyzed sol-gel process was utilized, followed by solvent exchange and surface modification with trimethylchlorosilane. Structural analysis via SEM revealed successful deposition of crack-free films when aging occurred in an ethanol environment. The aerogel displayed considerable specific surface area (115 m2/g), porosity (77.92%), and surface roughness (55-78%) along with a low refractive index (1.05), benefiting light harvesting. Preliminary solar testing showed increased output voltage with a 0.2 mm aerogel coating versus a bare cell. Further IV measurements demonstrated enhanced charge transport and conversion efficiency for the treated cell. The antireflective and light-trapping effects of aerogel appear to improve photon absorption. This initial research validates the potential of ambient pressure-synthesized hydrophobic silica aerogels to increase the performance of silicon photovoltaics cost-effectively. Further optimization of film thickness and morphology could realize higher efficiency gains.

Abstract: We employ spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and circular-dichroism ARPES to systematically investigate the spin texture of Sb-doped MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Our results display a hedgehog-like spin texture in this system which is signified by reversed-orienting out-of-plane spins at the Dirac gap. Our finding reveals the presence of time-reversal symmetry breaking, implying the possibility for realization of high-temperature quantum anomalous Hall effect.

Title: Odd-parity superconductivity underpinned by antiferromagnetism in heavy fermion metal YbRh$_2$Si$_2$
Authors: Lev V. Levitin, Jan Knapp, Petra Knappová, Marijn Lucas, Ján Nyéki, Petri Heikkinen, Vladimir Antonov, Andrew Casey, Andrew F. Ho, Piers Coleman, Christoph Geibel, Alexander Steppke, Kristin Kliemt, Cornelius Krellner, Manuel Brando, John Saunders
Abstract: Topological superconductors are essential elements of the periodic table of topological quantum matter. However, the relevant odd-parity spin-triplet superconductors are rare. We report high-resolution measurements of the complex electrical impedance of YbRh$_2$Si$_2$ down to 0.4 mK, that reveal the presence of several superconducting states, suppressed differently by magnetic field, both Pauli-limited and beyond the Pauli limit. Superconductivity is abruptly switched off at the critical field of the primary antiferromagnetic order. The onset of electro-nuclear spin density wave order enhances the superconductivity, which we account for by the simultaneous formation of a spin-triplet pair density wave. Together these observations provide compelling evidence for odd-parity superconductivity, and its underpinning by antiferromagnetism, and allow us to identify the topological helical state.

Title: Ground state properties of a spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet NH$_{4}$Fe(PO$_{3}$F)$_2$
Authors: S. Mohanty, K. M. Ranjith, C. S. Saramgi, Y. Skourski, B. Büchner, H. -J. Grafe, R. Nath
Abstract: Structural and magnetic properties of a two-dimensional spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ frustrated triangular lattice antiferromagnet NH$_{4}$Fe(PO$_{3}$F)$_2$ are explored via x-ray diffraction, magnetic susceptibility, high-field magnetization, heat capacity, and $^{31}$P nuclear magnetic resonance experiments on a polycrystalline sample. The compound portrays distorted triangular units of the Fe$^{3+}$ ions with anisotropic bond lengths. The magnetic susceptibility shows a broad maxima around $T^{\rm{max}}_{\chi}\simeq 12$ K, mimicking the short-range antiferromagnetic order of a low-dimensional spin system. The magnetic susceptibility and NMR shift could be modeled assuming the spin-$5/2$ isotropic triangular lattice model and the average value of the exchange coupling is estimated to be $J/k_{\rm B} \simeq 1.7$ K. This value of the exchange coupling is reproduced well from the saturation field of the pulse field data. It shows the onset of a magnetic ordering at $T_{\rm N} \simeq 5.7$ K, setting the frustration ratio of $f = \frac{|\theta_{\rm CW}|}{T_{\rm N}} \simeq 5.7$. Such a value of $f$ reflects moderate magnetic frustration in the compound. The d$M$/d$H$ vs $H$ plots of the low temperature magnetic isotherms exhibit a sharp peak at $H_{\rm SF} \simeq 1.45$ T, suggesting a field-induced spin-flop transition and magnetic anisotropy. The rectangular shape of the $^{31}$P NMR spectra below $T_{\rm N}$ unfolds that the ordering is commensurate antiferromagnet type. Three distinct phase regimes are clearly discerned in the $H - T$ phase diagram, redolent of a frustrated magnet with in-plane (XY-type) anisotropy.

Title: Transport of ultracold dipolar fermions in one-dimensional optical lattices
Authors: Barnali Chakrabarti, N D Chavda, Andrea Trombettoni, Arnaldo Gammal
Abstract: We investigate the transport properties in out-of-equilibrium dynamics of strongly correlated dipolar fermions initially localized in one-dimensional inhomogeneous optical lattice. The dynamics is studied by experimentally measurable dynamical variables such as one-body density, pair-correlation function and size of the expanding cloud. In the noninteracting limit, we trace the usual fingerprints of ballistic expansion in the short time dynamics. However, dynamics is strongly affected by system size due to Pauli principle. The dynamics also exhibits significant dependence on the sign of the interactions. We observe that strong repulsive dipolar interaction gives rise to many-body features in the dynamics, while strong attractive dipolar interaction leads to stabilized cluster states. Intermediate dipolar interaction are found to hinder expansion of correlations, while very strong dipolar interaction favors expansion of the cloud. Our work show the effect of dipolar interaction in the transport properties of interacting fermions, that can be studied in on-going experiments with ultracold dipolar fermions.

Title: New opportunities for high pressure hydrogen achieved by fullerane vibrating modes: an ab initio study
Authors: Leonard Constantin Gebac, Vasile Bercu
Abstract: The encapsulation of hydrogen within fullerene/fullerane cages offers a promising avenue for studying high pressure hydrogen dynamics. Through ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the behavior of a system consisting of hydrogen atoms enclosed in a \ch{C20H20} dodecahedrane. Our findings reveal significant structural and dynamical changes as the cage undergoes compression, corresponding to radial symmetric vibration. We analyze geometric, energetic, and thermodynamic parameters, highlighting correlations and observing behavior analogous to high pressure phases of hydrogen. Notably, our study bridges the gap between theory and experiment by proposing a novel approach to achieving high pressures and temperatures experimentally. These results not only contribute to the understanding of hydrogen behavior under extreme conditions but also hold implications for the quest to attain metallic hydrogen - a milestone in materials science with potential applications in various fields.

Title: Brightening dark excitons and trions in systems with a Mexican-hat energy dispersion: example of InSe
Authors: Lewis J. Burke, Mark T. Greenaway, Joseph J. Betouras
Abstract: We investigate the properties of momentum-dark excitons and trions formed in two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit an inverted Mexican-hat-shaped dispersion relation, taking monolayer InSe as an example. We employ variational techniques to obtain the momentum-dark and bright ground-states (non-zero and zero quasiparticle momenta, respectively). These states are of particular interest due to their peaks in the quasiparticle density of states, the largest contribution comes from the momentum-dark ground state due to the presence of a van Hove singularity (VHS). These momentum-dark systems require a physical process to provide the necessary momentum to become bright. We study the brightening of this state due to coupling with phonons and compute the resulting photoluminescence spectrum. This work opens new avenues of research, such as exploiting dark excitons in solar cells and other semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Quicker flocking in aligning active matters for noisier beginning
Authors: Sohini Chatterjee, Sohom Das, Purnendu Pathak, Tanay Paul, Subir K. Das
Abstract: The constituents in a class of active matter systems change their directions of motion by being influenced by the velocities of the neighbors. Such systems may undergo phase transitions, with respect to ordering in the velocity field, as well as clustering in the density field, when the strength of an externally imposed noise is varied. Via computer simulations, with a well-known model, that faithfully represents these systems, we show that evolutions in both clustering and ordering exhibit certain interesting features that were hitherto unrealized. The transformations occur quicker, following quenches to a fixed final state, below the transition point, for disordered starting states that are farther away from the ``critical" noise strength. This implies earliest arrival of the farthest, at a given destination. Detailed analysis of the results, combined with the outcomes from a similar study of para- to ferromagnetic transitions, show that the variation in critical fluctuations in the initial configurations can lead to such interesting effect. We quantify this via the Ornstein-Zernike theory.

Title: WyckoffDiff - A Generative Diffusion Model for Crystal Symmetry
Authors: Filip Ekström Kelvinius, Oskar B. Andersson, Abhijith S. Parackal, Dong Qian, Rickard Armiento, Fredrik Lindsten
Abstract: Crystalline materials often exhibit a high level of symmetry. However, most generative models do not account for symmetry, but rather model each atom without any constraints on its position or element. We propose a generative model, Wyckoff Diffusion (WyckoffDiff), which generates symmetry-based descriptions of crystals. This is enabled by considering a crystal structure representation that encodes all symmetry, and we design a novel neural network architecture which enables using this representation inside a discrete generative model framework. In addition to respecting symmetry by construction, the discrete nature of our model enables fast generation. We additionally present a new metric, Fréchet Wrenformer Distance, which captures the symmetry aspects of the materials generated, and we benchmark WyckoffDiff against recently proposed generative models for crystal generation.

Title: Resonant spin amplification and accumulation in MAPbI$_3$ single crystals
Authors: Erik Kirstein, Dmitri R. Yakovlev, Evgeny A. Zhukov, Nataliia E. Kopteva, Bekir Turedi, Maksym V. Kovalenko, Manfred Bayer
Abstract: Quantum technologic and spintronic applications require reliable semiconducting materials that enable a significant, long-living spin polarization of electronic excitations and offer the ability to manipulate it optically in an external field. Due to the specifics of band structure and remarkable spin-dependent properties, the lead halide perovskite semiconductors are suitable candidates for that. Here, the carrier spin dynamics in a MAPbI$_3$ (MA = methylammonium) perovskite single crystal with thickness of 20 $\mu$m are studied by the time-resolved Kerr ellipticity technique at cryogenic temperatures. Long times of longitudinal electron spin relaxation $T_1 = 30$ ns and transverse electron spin dephasing $T_{2,e}^*=21$ ns are found. The spin dynamics lasting longer than the applied laser pulse repetition period give rise to spin accumulation effects. We exploit them through the resonant spin amplification, polarization recovery, and spin inertia techniques to study the electron and hole spin systems coupled with the nuclear spins. These results establish the lead halide perovskite semiconductors as suitable platform for quantum technologies relying on spin-dependent phenomena.

Title: Crossover from BKT to first-order transition induced by higher-order terms in 2D XY models
Authors: Milan Žukovič
Abstract: We study phase transitions in $XY$ models, generalized by inclusion of $n$ higher-order pairwise interactions of equal strength, by Monte Carlo simulation. It is found that by adding new terms the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition, observed in the standard $XY$ model, gradually changes to the first-order phase transition. We determine the critical number of terms for which the first-order transition appears as $n_c=6$. It is also found that for $n=5$ the transition is pseudo-first-order but it becomes true first-order if the couplings are allowed to increase. In general, a more rapid increase of the coupling intensity supports the first-order transition, however, a too fast increase may result in splitting of the single transition to multiple transitions. Consequently, the minimal number of the terms required for the change of the BKT phase transition to first order in the present model with arbitrary couplings is estimated to be $2 < n_c \leq 5$.

Title: Electric Field-Induced Formation of a 2D Adatom Gas on Cryogenic Li Surfaces
Authors: Shyam Katnagallu, Huan Zhao, Se-Ho Kim, Baptiste Gault, Christoph Freysoldt, Jörg Neugebauer
Abstract: Intense electrostatic fields, such as those able to break bonds and cause field-ion emission, can fundamentally alter the behaviour of atoms at and on the surface. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the Li (110) surface under high electrostatic fields, we identify a critical field strength at which surface atoms occupying a kink site become thermodynamically unstable against adatom formation. This mechanism leads to the formation of a highly concentrated two-dimensional (2D) adatom gas on the surface. Moreover, the applied field reverses the stability of preferred adsorption sites, enabling barrierless diffusion of lithium atoms even well below the threshold required for field evaporation. The here identified mechanisms offer a unified explanation for experimental observations in atom probe tomography and for understanding high electric field phenomena in systems such as battery interfaces and electrochemical environments.

Title: A Grain Boundary Embrittlement Genome for Substitutional Cubic Alloys
Authors: Nutth Tuchinda, Gregory B. Olson, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: Grain boundary chemistry plays a critical role for the properties of metals and alloys, yet there is a lack of consistent datasets for alloy design and development. With the advent of artificial intelligence and machine learning in materials science, open materials models and datasets can be used to overcome such challenges. Here, we use a universal interatomic potential to compute a grain boundary segregation and embrittlement genome for the {\Sigma}5[001](210) grain boundary for FCC and BCC binary alloys. The grain boundary database calculated here serves as a design tool for the embrittlement of high-angle grain boundaries for alloys across 15 base metals system of Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe (both BCC and FCC), Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Rh, Ta, V and W with 75 solute elements for each.

Title: Finite temperature fermion Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin-Peierls systems
Authors: João C. Inácio, Jeroen van den Brink, Fakher F. Assaad, Toshihiro Sato
Abstract: The Abrikosov fermion representation of the spin-1/2 degree of freedom allows for auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations of frustrated spin systems. This approach provides a manifold of equivalent actions over which the negative sign problem can be optimised. As a result, we can reach temperature scales well below the magnetic scale. Here, we show how to generalise this algorithm to spin-Peierls systems. In contrast to exact diagonalisation approaches, Monte Carlo methods are not Hilbert space bound such that the computational effort per sweep remains invariant when adding phonons. However, the computational effort required to generate independent configurations increases in the presence of phonons. We also show that, for the specific case of the Kitaev-Heisenberg model, the inclusion of phonons does not render the negative sign problem more severe. This new algorithm hence allows us to investigate the interplay between phonon degrees of freedom and magnetic frustration. We present results for frustrated and non-frustrated spin systems.

Title: Emulating Novel Topological Phases with Ultracold Fermions in Optical Lattices
Authors: Zhi Lin, Qi Song, Sheng Yue, Ming Yang, Jie Lou, Yan Chen
Abstract: We propose a feasible scheme utilizing the Floquet engineering platform with ultracold atoms in optical lattices to emulate both pair-hopping processes and singlet/triplet pairing interactions, aiming to simulate and control novel topologically nontrivial phases. Our large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations reveal three distinct topological regimes: (i) a Majorana-enabled spin-density-wave (MS) phase characterized by exponentially localized edge charges, non-local single-fermion edge correlations, a doubly degenerate entanglement spectrum; (ii) a $z$-axis polarized triplet superconducting (TS) phase manifesting fractionalized edge spin; and (iii) a novel x-directional triplet superconducting (XTS) phase exhibiting fractional edge spins along the $x$-direction and non-local single-particle edge correlations, merging characteristics of the edge states from both MS and TS phases. Therefore, our work establishes a versatile framework for exploring exotic quantum phases and non-Abelian edge states in number-conserving systems.

Title: Topological Constraint Model of Alkaline Earth Vanadate Glasses
Authors: Adam Shearer, John C. Mauro
Abstract: Topological constraint theory has enabled the successful prediction of glass properties over a wide range of compositions. In this study, a topological constraint model is constructed for alkaline earth vanadate glasses based on experimental data. The change in vanadate structural units from VO5 to VO4 was modeled as a function of alkaline earth content and related to thermal and mechanical properties. The model covers both high and low-temperature properties to probe the temperature dependence of constraint rigidity for each constituent of the glass network. The model is changed to describe anomalies in magnesium sites potentially implying that magnesium can form locally rigid structures. Furthermore, the traditional understanding of vanadate glass structure is compared to recent results concluding that the terminal oxygen must exist as a part of the VO4 units. Results for the model explain that bridging oxygen constraints are the main contributors to network rigidity in both low and high temperature regimes. Vanadate glass networks are highly connected even with the introduction of modifier species, which introduce their own bond constraints. Corroboration between experimental data and the topological constraint model illustrates the role of alkaline earth oxides in the glass network.

Title: Magnons in chromium trihalides from \emph{ab initio} Bethe-Salpeter equation
Authors: Ali Esquembre-Kučukalić, Khoa B. Le, Alberto García-Cristóbal, Marco Bernardi, Davide Sangalli, Alejandro Molina-Sánchez
Abstract: Chromium trihalides (CrX$_3$, with $\rm{X=I,Br,Cl}$) are layered ferromagnetic materials with rich physics and possible applications. Their structure consists of magnetic Cr atoms positioned between two layers of halide atoms. The choice of halide results in distinct magnetic properties, but their effect on spin-wave (magnon) excitations is not fully understood. Here we present first-principles calculations of magnon dispersions and wave functions for monolayer Cr trihalides using the finite-momentum Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) to describe collective spin-flip excitations. % We study the dependence of magnon dispersions on the halide species and resolve the small topological gap at the Dirac point in the magnon spectrum by including spin-orbit coupling. Analysis of magnon wave functions reveals that magnons are made up of electronic transitions with a wider energy range than excitons in CrX$_3$ monolayers, providing insight into magnon states in real and reciprocal space. We discuss Heisenberg exchange parameters extracted from the BSE and discuss the convergence of BSE magnon calculations. Our work advances the quantitative modeling of magnons in two-dimensional materials, providing the starting point for studying magnon interactions in a first-principles BSE framework.

Title: Tunable exciton polaritons in biased bilayer graphene
Authors: V. G. M. Duarte, P. Ninhos, C. Tserkezis, N. Asger Mortensen, N. M. R. Peres, A. J. Chaves
Abstract: By harnessing the unique properties of bilayer graphene, we present a flexible platform for achieving electrically tunable exciton polaritons within a microcavity. Using a semiclassical approach, we solve Maxwell's equations within the cavity, approximating the optical conductivity of bilayer graphene through its excitonic response as described by the Elliott formula. Transitioning to a quantum mechanical framework, we diagonalize the Hamiltonian governing excitons and cavity photons, revealing the resulting polariton dispersions, Hopfield coefficients and Rabi splittings. Our analysis predicts that, under realistic exciton lifetimes, the exciton-photon interaction reaches the strong coupling regime. Furthermore, we explore the integration of an epsilon-near-zero material within the cavity, demonstrating that such a configuration can further enhance the light-matter interaction.

Title: Supersolid phases of bosons
Authors: Sudip Sinha, S. Sinha
Abstract: Supersolids--the enigmatic phase of quantum matter, with properties resembling both the superfluid and solid states--have been actively sought over the past 70 years. We provide a comprehensive review of the to-date development in experimental and theoretical studies of supersolid bosons, with a particular focus on their observation in ultracold atomic gases. Additionally, the use of optical lattice facilitates the realization of 'lattice-supersolids', which paves the way to study the effect of correlations in a controlled manner. A brief theoretical framework is presented to characterize this puzzling state with competing orders and to gain insight into its basic properties. Various types of supersolid phases and the different platforms used to achieve them are described. Finally, we discuss the future prospects of research and the potential to achieve supersolids with more exotic features.

Title: Survival probabilities in biased random walks: To restart or not to restart? that is the question
Authors: Shahar Hod
Abstract: The time-dependent survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ of biased Sisyphus random walkers, who at each time step have a finite probability $q$ to step towards an absorbing trap at the origin and a complementary probability $1-q$ to return to their initial position $x_0$, is derived {\it analytically}. In particular, we explicitly prove that the survival probability function of the walkers decays exponentially at asymptotically late times. Interestingly, our analysis reveals the fact that, for a given value $q$ of the biased jumping probability, the survival probability function $S(t;x_0,q)$ is characterized by a {\it critical} (marginal) value $x^{\text{crit}}_0(q)$ of the initial gap between the walkers and the trap, above which the late-time survival probability of the biased Sisyphus random walkers is {\it larger} than the corresponding survival probability of standard random walkers.

Title: Filling a gap in materials mechanics: Nanoindentation at high constant strain rates upto $10^5 s^{-1}$
Authors: Lalith Kumar Bhaskar, Dipali Sonawane, Hendrik Holz, Jeongin Paeng, Peter Schweizer, Jing Rao, Bárbara Bellón, Damian Frey, Aloshious Lambai, Laszlo Petho, Johann Michler, Jakob Schwiedrzik, Gaurav Mohanty, Gerhard Dehm, Rajaprakash Ramachandramoorthy
Abstract: Understanding the dynamic behaviour of materials has long been a key focus in the field of high strain rate testing, and a critical yet unresolved question is whether flow stresses exhibit a significant strength upturn at strain rates ranging between $10^3$ and $10^4 s^{-1}$, and, if so, why. Current macro- and microscale mechanical testing is limited, as no single experimental method spans the entire strain rate range of $10^2$ to $10^5 s^{-1}$, where such an upturn is expected. In this study, we address these limitations using a highly customized piezoelectric in situ nanomechanical test setup, which enables, for the first time, constant indentation strain rates up to $10^5 s^{-1}$. This system was employed to investigate the rate-dependent hardness in single-crystalline molybdenum, nanocrystalline nickel, and amorphous fused silica across strain rates of $10^1$ to $10^5 s^{-1}$, remarkably revealing an upturn in hardness in all three materials. The constancy of strain rate allowed, post-deformation microstructural analysis specific to the tested strain rates, shedding light on the potential mechanisms causing the hardness upturn.

Title: Topological Phase Transitions in Kagome Ferromagnets: The Role of Intrinsic Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling
Authors: Ritwik Das, Arkamitra Sen, Indra Dasgupta
Abstract: The theoretically predicted Chern insulators have highlighted the potential of easy-axis kagome ferromagnets to host the quantum anomalous Hall effect. This phenomenon can also emerge from in-plane ferromagnetism in kagome systems via the breaking of both out-of-plane and in-plane mirror symmetries. In this paper, we demonstrate that the interplay between magnetism and mirror symmetries makes ferromagnetic kagome systems a versatile platform for realizing nontrivial topological phases, with the orientation of magnetic moments $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$ at lattice sites serving as a key tuning parameter. We show that the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) induced by broken out-of-plane mirror symmetry together with the intrinsic SOC incorporated in a tight-binding model captures the rich topological phase diagram of kagome systems as a function of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi)$. In particular, the restoration of in-plane mirror symmetry for specific values of $\phi$ promotes topological phase transition upon variation of in-plane orientation of the moments $\hat{m}(\theta=90^{\circ},\phi)$. However the topological phase transition for the variation of $\hat{m}(\theta,\phi=$constant) is dictated by a competition between Rashba SOC and intrinsic SOC. Density functional theory calculations for the ferromagnetic kagome monolayer Co$_3$Pb$_3$S$_2$, a representative compound belonging to the family Co$_3$X$_3$Y$_2$ (X=Sn, Pb; Y=S, Se) further corroborate our predictions based on the proposed tight-binding model.

Title: Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride
Authors: Nisha Geng, Giacomo Scillla, Eva Zurek
Abstract: This study investigates 180 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 31 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only nine semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.

Authors: A. Tononi, D. S. Petrov, M. Lewenstein
Abstract: We solve the problem of a dimer moving on a spherical surface and find that its binding energy and wave function are sensitive to the total angular momentum. The dimer gets squeezed in the direction orthogonal to the center-of-mass motion and can qualitatively change its geometry from two-dimensional to one-dimensional.

Title: Persistent spin grids with spin-orbit coupled 2D electron gas
Authors: A. V. Poshakinskiy
Abstract: We consider the diffusive spin dynamics of a 2D electron gas with spin-orbit coupling confined within a grid of narrow channels. We show that the lifetime of certain spin distributions in such grids greatly exceeds that in an unconfined 2D electron gas and diverges as the channel width approaches zero. Such persistent spin grids occur if the electron spin orientation remains invariant after diffusion around the grid plaquette. We establish a topological $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification for persistent spin grids and speculate that the setup can be used to simulate non-Abelian lattice gauge theories.

Title: Observation of Magnon-Polarons in the Fermi-Hubbard Model
Authors: Max L. Prichard, Zengli Ba, Ivan Morera, Benjamin M. Spar, David A. Huse, Eugene Demler, Waseem S. Bakr
Abstract: The interplay of magnetic excitations and itinerant charge carriers is a ubiquitous phenomenon in strongly correlated electron systems. In the vicinity of magnetically ordered phases, strong interactions between itinerant quasiparticles and magnetic excitations can result in the dramatic renormalization of both. A key theoretical question is understanding the renormalization of the magnon quasiparticle, a collective spin excitation, upon doping a magnetic insulator. Here, we report the observation of a new type of quasiparticle arising from the dressing of a magnon with the doped holes of a cold atom Fermi-Hubbard system, i.e. a magnon-Fermi-polaron. Utilizing Raman excitation with controlled momentum in a doped, spin-polarized band insulator, we address the spectroscopic properties of the magnon-polaron. In an undoped system with strong interactions, photoexcitation produces magnons, whose properties are accurately described by spin wave theory. We measure the evolution of the photoexcitation spectra as we move away from this limit to produce magnon-polarons due to dressing of the magnons by charge excitations. We observe a shift in the polaron energy with doping that is strongly dependent on the injected momentum, accompanied by a reduction of spectral weight in the probed energy window. We anticipate that the technique introduced here, which is the analog of inelastic neutron scattering, will provide atomic quantum simulators access to the dynamics of a wide variety of excitations in strongly correlated phases.

Title: Visualization of topological shear polaritons in gypsum thin films

Abstract: Low symmetry crystals have recently emerged as a platform for exploring novel light-matter interactions in the form of hyperbolic shear polaritons. These excitations exhibit unique optical properties such as frequency-dispersive optical axes and asymmetric light propagation and energy dissipation, which arise from the presence of non-orthogonal resonances. However, only non-vdW materials have been demonstrated to support hyperbolic shear polaritons, limiting their exotic properties and potential applications. Here we introduce for the first time novel shear phenomena in low symmetry crystal thin films by demonstrating the existence of elliptical and canalized shear phonon polaritons in gypsum, an exfoliable monoclinic sulphate mineral. Our results unveil a topological transition from hyperbolic shear to elliptical shear polaritons, passing through a canalization regime with strong field confinement. Importantly, we observe a significant slowdown of group velocity, reaching values as low as 0.0005c, highlighting the potential of gypsum for "slow light" applications and extreme light-matter interaction control. These findings expand the application scope of low-symmetry crystals with the benefits that an exfoliable material provides, such as stronger field confinement, tunability, and versatility for its incorporation in complex photonic devices that might unlock new optical phenomena at the nanoscale.

Title: Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices
Authors: Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.

Title: Phase Transitions in Nonreciprocal Driven-Dissipative Condensates
Authors: Ron Belyansky, Cheyne Weis, Ryo Hanai, Peter B. Littlewood, Aashish A. Clerk
Abstract: We investigate the influence of boundaries and spatial nonreciprocity on nonequilibrium driven-dissipative phase transitions. We focus on a one-dimensional lattice of nonlinear bosons described by a Lindblad master equation, where the interplay between coherent and incoherent dynamics generates nonreciprocal interactions between sites. Using a mean-field approach, we analyze the phase diagram under both periodic and open boundary conditions. For periodic boundaries, the system always forms a condensate at nonzero momentum and frequency, resulting in a time-dependent traveling wave pattern. In contrast, open boundaries reveal a far richer phase diagram, featuring multiple static and dynamical phases, as well as exotic phase transitions, including the spontaneous breaking of particle-hole symmetry associated with a critical exceptional point and phases with distinct bulk and edge behavior. Our model avoids post-selection or unphysical non-Hermitian Hamiltonians and is experimentally realizable in platforms such as superconducting circuits.

Title: Parameter Symmetry Breaking and Restoration Determines the Hierarchical Learning in AI Systems
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Yizhou Xu, Tomaso Poggio, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: The dynamics of learning in modern large AI systems is hierarchical, often characterized by abrupt, qualitative shifts akin to phase transitions observed in physical systems. While these phenomena hold promise for uncovering the mechanisms behind neural networks and language models, existing theories remain fragmented, addressing specific cases. In this paper, we posit that parameter symmetry breaking and restoration serve as a unifying mechanism underlying these behaviors. We synthesize prior observations and show how this mechanism explains three distinct hierarchies in neural networks: learning dynamics, model complexity, and representation formation. By connecting these hierarchies, we highlight symmetry -- a cornerstone of theoretical physics -- as a potential fundamental principle in modern AI.

Title: Diagonal Symmetrization of Neural Network Solvers for the Many-Electron Schr\"odinger Equation
Authors: Kevin Han Huang, Ni Zhan, Elif Ertekin, Peter Orbanz, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: Incorporating group symmetries into neural networks has been a cornerstone of success in many AI-for-science applications. Diagonal groups of isometries, which describe the invariance under a simultaneous movement of multiple objects, arise naturally in many-body quantum problems. Despite their importance, diagonal groups have received relatively little attention, as they lack a natural choice of invariant maps except in special cases. We study different ways of incorporating diagonal invariance in neural network ansätze trained via variational Monte Carlo methods, and consider specifically data augmentation, group averaging and canonicalization. We show that, contrary to standard ML setups, in-training symmetrization destabilizes training and can lead to worse performance. Our theoretical and numerical results indicate that this unexpected behavior may arise from a unique computational-statistical tradeoff not found in standard ML analyses of symmetrization. Meanwhile, we demonstrate that post hoc averaging is less sensitive to such tradeoffs and emerges as a simple, flexible and effective method for improving neural network solvers.

Title: Deciphering Carrier Dynamics in Polycarbonate Following Excitation with Ultrashort Laser Pulses
Authors: George D. Tsibidis, Matina Vlahou, Stella Maragkaki, Ioannis Konidakis, Emmanuel Stratakis
Abstract: Polymers exposed to ultrashort pulsed lasers (UPL) experience a range of physical and chemical changes that play a key role in applications ranging from material processing to advanced photonics, and biomedicine. To elucidate the interaction of UPL with polymeric materials, ultrafast phenomena such as carrier dynamics, recombination and relaxation are investigated assuming polycarbonate (PC) as a test material exposed to laser pulses of moderate energies. A theoretical model developed for dielectric materials is extended to describe the, previously, unexplored excitation and carrier dynamics for PC while femtosecond Transient Absorption Spectroscopy is used to elucidate the evolution of the materials response and ultrafast dynamics. Interpreting the experimental measurements using the theoretical model suggests the existence of an energy level that facilitates the formation of self-trapped exciton metastates between the conduction and valence bands (approximately 2.4-2.8 eV below the conduction band). It also predicts the electron-plasma lifetime (around 110-150 fs), the recombination time (about 34 ps), and the non-linear part of the refractive index due to Kerr effect (with n_2 values ranging from (1.1-1.5)x10^{-16} cm2/W). Furthermore, the dominant character of multi-photon assisted ionisation is emphasised while the optical breakdown threshold is also calculated and found to be equal to 2.55 x10^12 W/cm2. The results are expected to support future efforts aimed at elucidating how intense ultrashort laser pulses interact with polymeric materials which is crucial for optimizing the manufacturing processes of these materials for potential applications.

Title: Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs): Combining Accuracy and Interpretability in Data-Driven Material Modeling
Authors: Kian P. Abdolazizi, Roland C. Aydin, Christian J. Cyron, Kevin Linka
Abstract: Hybrid constitutive modeling integrates two complementary approaches for describing and predicting a material's mechanical behavior: purely data-driven black-box methods and physically constrained, theory-based models. While black-box methods offer high accuracy, they often lack interpretability and extrapolability. Conversely, physics-based models provide theoretical insight and generalizability but may fall short of capturing complex behaviors with the same precision. Traditionally, hybrid modeling has required a trade-off between these aspects. In this paper, we show how recent advances in symbolic machine learning, specifically Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs), help overcome this limitation. We introduce Constitutive Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (CKANs) as a new class of hybrid constitutive models. By incorporating a post-processing symbolification step, CKANs combine the predictive accuracy of data-driven models with the interpretability and extrapolation capabilities of symbolic expressions, bridging the gap between machine learning and physical modeling.

Title: Qubit Regurlarization of Quantum Field Theories
Authors: Shailesh Chandrasekharan
Abstract: To study quantum field theories on a quantum computer, we must begin with Hamiltonians defined on a finite-dimensional Hilbert space and then take appropriate limits. This approach can be seen as a new type of regularization for quantum field theories, which we refer to as qubit regularization. A related finite-dimensional regularization, known as the D-theory approach, was proposed long ago as a general framework for all quantum field theories. In this framework, the dimensionality of the local Hilbert space at each spatial point can increase as needed through an additional flavor index. To reproduce asymptotically free QFTs, most studies assume that qubit-regularized theories require extending the local Hilbert space to infinity. However, contrary to this common belief, recent discoveries in (1+1) dimensions have revealed two examples where asymptotic freedom appears to emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space through a novel renormalization group (RG) flow. These findings motivate further investigation into whether asymptotically free gauge theories could also emerge within a strictly finite-dimensional local Hilbert space. To support these explorations, we propose an orthonormal basis called the monomer-dimer-tensor-network (MDTN) basis and use it to construct new types of qubit-regularized lattice gauge theories.

Title: Symmetric Tensor Coupling in Holographic Mean-Field Theory: Deformed Dirac Cones
Authors: Moongul Byun, Taewon Yuk, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: We extend the holographic mean-field theory to rank-two symmetric tensor order parameter field coupled with fermion. We classify the roles of symmetric tensor order according to the effect on the spectral density: cone-angle change, squashing, and tilting of the spectral light cones. In case of the over-tilted light cone, an analytic continuation of the Green's function is necessary to preserve the continuity of the spectrum inside the lightcone. Our results provide agreements between the holographic spectra with those observed in real materials, such as type-II Dirac cones and strained graphene.

Title: Complexity and accessibility of random landscapes
Authors: Sakshi Pahujani, Joachim Krug
Abstract: These notes introduce probabilistic landscape models defined on high-dimensional discrete sequence spaces. The models are motivated primarily by fitness landscapes in evolutionary biology, but links to statistical physics and computer science are mentioned where appropriate. Elementary and advanced results on the structure of landscapes are described with a focus on features that are relevant to evolutionary searches, such as the number of local maxima and the existence of fitness-monotonic paths. The recent discovery of submodularity as a biologically meaningful property of fitness landscapes and its consequences for their accessibility is discussed in detail.

Title: Known Unknowns: Out-of-Distribution Property Prediction in Materials and Molecules
Authors: Nofit Segal, Aviv Netanyahu, Kevin P. Greenman, Pulkit Agrawal, Rafael Gomez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Discovery of high-performance materials and molecules requires identifying extremes with property values that fall outside the known distribution. Therefore, the ability to extrapolate to out-of-distribution (OOD) property values is critical for both solid-state materials and molecular design. Our objective is to train predictor models that extrapolate zero-shot to higher ranges than in the training data, given the chemical compositions of solids or molecular graphs and their property values. We propose using a transductive approach to OOD property prediction, achieving improvements in prediction accuracy. In particular, the True Positive Rate (TPR) of OOD classification of materials and molecules improved by 3x and 2.5x, respectively, and precision improved by 2x and 1.5x compared to non-transductive baselines. Our method leverages analogical input-target relations in the training and test sets, enabling generalization beyond the training target support, and can be applied to any other material and molecular tasks.

Title: Neurophysiological correlates to the human brain complexity through $q$-statistical analysis of electroencephalogram
Authors: Dimitri Marques Abramov, Daniel de Freitas Quintanilha, Henrique Santos Lima, Roozemeria Pereira Costa, Carla Kamil-Leite, Vladimir V. Lazarev, Constantino Tsallis
Abstract: The prospects of assessing neural complexity (NC) by $q$-statistics of the systemic organization of different types and levels of brain activity were studied. In 70 adult subjects, NC was assessed via the parameter $q$ of $q$-statistics, applied to the ongoing and EEG and its spectral power of 20 scalp points (channels). The NC were estimated both globally for all channels (AllCh) and locally (for each single channel) in different Functional States (FSs). The values of $q$ was compared among FSs and single channels, as well they were correlated with the power of $\theta$ (4-8Hz), $\beta_1$ (15-25Hz) and others EEG bands, in each FS. The value of $q$ across all FSs was higher for AllCh than for the single channels FSs. Consistently with previous studies, we found a negative correlation between NC and age. The FSs did not influence the $q$ of the EEG in AllCh, although locally the FS modulated $q$ in a consistent manner (e.g., reducing $q$ in posterior sites with eyes closed). The $q$ was correlated positively with the power of the $\theta$ and negatively with that of the $\beta_1$ band in general. These findings support the idea that, as a first approach, $q$-statistics can describe the human NC. The relationship between $q$ and $\theta$ power aligns with greater NC during FSs such as listening music and resting with eyes open, which is consistent with high-order representations rather than low-informative attentional tasks (OddBall).

Title: An exactly solvable tight-binding billiard in graphene
Authors: D. Condado, E. Sadurní
Abstract: A triangular graphenic billiard is defined as a planar carbon polymer in the Hückeloid approximation of $\pi-$band electrons. It is shown that the equilateral triangle of arbitrary size and zig-zag edges allows for exact solutions of the associated spectral problem. This is done by a construction of wave superpositions similar to the Lamé solution of the Helmholtz equation in a triangular cavity, revisited by Pinsky. Exact wave functions, eigenvalues, degeneracies, and edge states are provided. The edge states are also obtained by a non-periodic construction of waves with vanishing energy. A comment on its connection with recent molecular models, such as triangulene, is given.

Title: Nonlinearity-induced Fractional Thouless Pumping of Solitons
Authors: Yu-Liang Tao, Yongping Zhang, Yong Xu
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that a soliton can be {\it fractionally} transported by slowly varying a system parameter over one period in a nonlinear system. This phenomenon is attributed to the nontrivial topology of the corresponding energy bands of a linear Hamiltonian. Here we find the occurrence of fractional Thouless pumping of solitons in a nonlinear off-diagonal Aubry-André-Harper model. Surprisingly, this happens despite the fact that all the energy bands of the linear Hamiltonian are topologically trivial, indicating that nonlinearity can induce fractional Thouless pumping of solitons. Specifically, our results show that a soliton can be pumped across one unit cell over one, two, three or four pump periods, implying an average displacement of $1$, $1/2$, $1/3$ or $1/4$ unit cells per cycle, respectively. We attribute these behaviors to changes in on-site potentials induced by a soliton solution, leading to the nontrivial topology for the modified linear Hamiltonian. Given that our model relies solely on varying nearest-neighbor hoppings, it is readily implementable on existing state-of-the-art photonic platforms.

Title: Modeling of High-Sensitivity SAW Magnetic Field Sensors with Au-SiO2 Phononic Crystals
Authors: Mohsen Samadi, Jana Marie Meyer, Elizaveta Spetzler, Benjamin Spetzler, Jeffrey McCord, Fabian Lofink, Martina Gerken
Abstract: The development of magnetic field sensors with high sensitivity is crucial for accurate detection of magnetic fields. In this context, we present a theoretical model of a highly sensitive surface acoustic wave (SAW) magnetic field sensor that utilizes phononic crystal (PnC) structures composed of Au pillars embedded within a SiO2 guiding layer. We study rectangular and triangular PnCs and assess their potential for application in thin-film magnetic field sensors. In our design, the PnC is integrated into the SiO2 guiding layer, preserving the continuous magnetostrictive layer and maximizing its interaction with the SAW. The sensor achieves nearly two orders of magnitude higher sensitivity compared to a continuous delay line of similar dimensions and an eight-fold improvement over the previous sensor design with PnCs composed of FeCoSiB pillars. The enhanced sensitivity is attributed to resonance effects within the PnC leading to an increased interaction between the SAW and the continuous FeCoSiB layer covering the PnC. Our results highlight the significant potential of incorporating PnCs into the guiding layer of SAWs for future high performance magnetic field sensors.

Title: Dispersion of backward-propagating waves in a surface defect on a 3D photonic band gap crystal
Authors: Timon J. Vreman, Melissa J. Goodwin, Lars J. Corbijn van Willenswaard, William L. Barnes, Ad Lagendijk, Willem L. Vos
Abstract: We experimentally study the dispersion relation of waves in a two-dimensional (2D) defect layer with periodic nanopores that sits on a three-dimensional (3D) photonic band gap crystal made from silicon by CMOS-compatible methods. The nanostructures are probed by momentum-resolved broadband near-infrared imaging of p-polarized reflected light that is collected inside the light cone as a function of off-axis wave vectors. We identify surface defect modes at frequencies inside the band gap with a narrow relative linewidth ($\Delta\omega/\omega$ = 0.028), which are absent in defect-free 3D crystals. We calculate the dispersion of modes with relevant mode symmetries using a plane-wave-expansion supercell method with no free parameters. The calculated dispersion matches very well with the measured data. The dispersion is negative in one of the off-axis directions, corresponding to backward-propagating waves where the phase velocity and the group velocity point in opposite directions, as confirmed by finite-difference time-domain simulations. We also present an analytic model of a 2D grating sandwiched between vacuum and a negative real $\epsilon'$ < 0 that mimics the 3D photonic band gap. The model's dispersion agrees with the experiments and with the fuller theory and shows that the backward propagation is caused by the surface grating. We discuss possible applications, including a device that senses the output direction of photons emitted by quantum emitters in response to their frequency.

Title: Gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy for lattice systems of continuous spins
Authors: Ronan Herry, Thomas Leblé
Abstract: We consider an infinite lattice system of interacting spins living on a smooth compact manifold, with short- but not necessarily finite-range pairwise interactions. We construct the gradient flow of the infinite-volume free energy on the space of translation-invariant spin measures, using an adaptation of the variational approach in Wasserstein space pioneered by Jordan, Kinderlehrer, and Otto. We also construct the infinite-volume diffusion corresponding to the so-called overdamped Langevin dynamics of the spins under the effect of the interactions and of thermal agitation. We show that the trajectories of the gradient flow and of the law of the spins under this diffusion both satisfy, in a weak sense, the same hierarchy of coupled parabolic PDE's, which we interpret as an infinite-volume Fokker--Planck--Kolmogorov equation. We prove regularity of weak solutions and derive an Evolution Variational Inequality for regular solutions, which implies uniqueness. Thus, in particular, the trajectories of the gradient flow coincide with those obtained from the Langevin dynamics. Concerning the long-time evolution, we check that the free energy is always non-increasing along the flow and that moreover, if the Ricci curvature of the spin space is uniformly positive, then at high enough temperature the dynamics converges exponentially, in free energy and in specific Wasserstein distance, to the unique minimizer of the infinite-volume free energy.

Title: Charging a Dimerized Quantum XY Chain
Authors: Riccardo Grazi, Fabio Cavaliere, Niccolò Traverso Ziani, Dario Ferraro
Abstract: Quantum batteries are quantum systems designed to store energy and release it on demand. The optimization of their performance is an intensively studied topic within the realm of quantum technologies. Such optimization forces the question: how do quantum many-body systems work as quantum batteries? To address this issue, we rely on symmetry and symmetry breaking via quantum phase transitions. Specifically, we analyze a dimerized quantum XY chain in a transverse field as a prototype of an energy storage device. This model, which is characterized by ground states with different symmetries depending on the Hamiltonian parameters, can be mapped onto a spinless fermionic chain with superconducting correlations, displaying a rich quantum phase diagram. We show that the stored energy strongly depends on the quantum phase diagram of the model when large charging times are considered.

Title: Quasi-bound states in the continuum in finite waveguide grating couplers
Authors: Torgom Yezekyan, Roza Gabrielyan, Sergey I. Bozhevolnyi
Abstract: Finite-size effects occurring for quasi-bound states in the continuum (qBIC) formed in symmetric and asymmetric all-dielectric waveguide grating couplers are investigated using numerical simulations for different configuration parameters. We find that the beam size plays a crucial role in the formation of additional qBIC resonances originating in forbidden for plane-wave incidence BIC resonances, whose manifestation is strongly influenced by the beam divergence. Another parameter is the strength of Bragg reflection, determining the spatial extension of a distributed Bragg resonator (DBR): in configurations with strong Bragg reflection, the excited and Bragg reflected counterpropagating waveguide modes are confined within the footprint of the incident beam. Conversely, the DBR formed in configurations with weak Bragg reflection extends well beyond the incident beam footprint, resulting in high sensitivity of the system response to the grating width and incident beam position. We believe that our findings provide valuable insights for optimizing photonic devices that leverage qBIC resonances in finite-sized structures under realistic excitation conditions.

Title: Strong coupling between a dielectric nanocavity and a monolayer transition metal dichalcogenide
Authors: F. Schröder, P. Wyborski, M. Xiong, G. Kountouris, B. Munkhbat, M. Wubs, P. T. Kristensen, J. Mørk, N. Stenger
Abstract: We demonstrate strong light-matter interaction of a dielectric nanocavity with deep sub-wavelength confinement of light and excitons in a monolayer of molybdenum ditelluride (MoTe2). Avoided crossing is demonstrated with both photoluminescence and reflection measurements, from which we extract a light-matter interaction strength of $g \approx 5$ meV. The associated Rabi splitting is twice as large as the system's losses. These values are in good agreement with numerically-obtained values with the exciton-reaction coordinate formalism, yielding $4.6$ meV. The strong light-matter interaction, combined with the low losses and the sub-wavelength light confinement, could pave the way towards single-photon nonlinearities.

Title: Formation of ultracold triatomic molecules by electric microwave association
Authors: Baraa Shammout, Leon Karpa, Silke Ospelkaus, Eberhard Tiemann, Olivier Dulieu
Abstract: A theoretical model is proposed for the formation of ultracold ground-state triatomic molecules in weakly bound energy levels. The process is driven by the electric component of a microwave field, which induces the association of an ultracold atom colliding with an ultracold diatomic molecule. This model is exemplified using $^{39}$K atoms and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K molecules, both in their ground states, a scenario of experimental relevance. The model assumes that the dynamics of the association are dominated by the long-range van der Waals interaction between $^{39}$K and $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K. The electric microwave association mechanism relies on the intrinsic electric dipole moment of $^{23}$Na$^{39}$K, which drives transitions between its lowest rotational levels ( $j$=0 and $j$=1). The energies of the uppermost triatomic energy levels are computed by numerically solving coupled Schrödinger equations using the Mapped Fourier Grid Hamiltonian method. Measurable association rates are derived within the framework of a perturbative approach. This method of electric microwave association provides an alternative to atom-molecule association via magnetic Feshbach resonances for forming ultracold, deeply bound triatomic molecules, and is applicable to a wide range of polar diatomic molecules.

Title: Time Evolution of the Symmetry Resolved Entanglement Entropy after a Mass Quench
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Michele Mazzoni, Fabio Sailis, Olalla A. Castro-Alvaredo
Abstract: In this paper we investigate the properties of the symmetry resolved entanglement entropy after a mass quench in the Ising field theory. Since the theory is free and the post-quench state known explicitly, the one-point function of the relevant (composite) branch point twist field can be computed using form factor techniques, similar to previous work on the branch point twist field and the magnetisation, respectively. We find that the symmetry resolved entropy grows linearly in time at the same rate as the total entropy, and that there are sub-leading oscillatory corrections. This result provides the first explicit computation of the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of the symmetry resolved entropy employing twist fields in quantum field theory and is consistent with existing results based on the quasiparticle picture.

Title: Complex Brillouin Zone for Localised Modes in Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Problems
Authors: Yannick De Bruijn, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen
Abstract: We develop a mathematical and numerical framework for studying evanescent waves in subwavelength band gap materials. By establishing a link between the complex Brillouin zone and various Hermitian and non-Hermitian phenomena, including defect localisation in band gap materials and the non-Hermitian skin effect, we provide a unified perspective on these systems. In two-dimensional structures, we develop analytical techniques and numerical methods to study singularities of the complex band structure. This way, we demonstrate that gap functions effectively predict the decay rates of defect states. Furthermore, we present an analysis of the Floquet transform with respect to complex quasimomenta. Based on this, we show that evanescent waves may undergo a phase transition, where local oscillations drastically depend on the location of corresponding frequency inside the band gap.

Title: Compact Quantum Dot Models for Analog Microwave co-Simulation
Authors: Lorenzo Peri, Alberto Gomez-Saiz, Christopher J. B. Ford, M. Fernando Gonzalez-Zalba
Abstract: Scalable solid-state quantum computers will require integration with analog and digital electronics. Efficiently simulating the quantum-classical electronic interface is hence of paramount importance. Here, we present Verilog-A compact models with a focus on quantum-dot-based systems, relevant to semiconductor- and Majorana-based quantum computing. Our models are capable of faithfully reproducing coherent quantum behavior within a standard electronic circuit simulator, enabling compromise-free co-simulation of hybrid quantum devices. In particular, we present results from co-simulations performed in Cadence Spectre, showcasing coherent quantum phenomena in circuits with both quantum and classical components using an industry-standard electronic design and automation tool. Our work paves the way for a new paradigm in the design of quantum systems, which leverages the many decades of development of electronic computer-aided design and automation tools in the semiconductor industry to now simulate and optimize quantum processing units, quantum-classical interfaces, and hybrid quantum-analog circuits.

Title: Exact NESS of XXZ circuits boundary driven with arbitrary resets or fields
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: We propose spatially inhomogeneous matrix product ansatz for an exact many-body density operator of a boundary driven XXZ quantum circuit. The ansatz has formally infinite bond-dimension and is fundamentally different from previous constructions. The circuit is driven by a pair of reset quantum channels applied on the boundary qubits, which polarize the qubits to arbitrary pure target states. Moreover, one of the reset channels can be replaced by an arbitrary local unitary gate, thus representing a hybrid case with coherent/incoherent driving. Analyzing the ansatz we obtain a family of relatively robust separable nonequilibrium steady states (NESS), which can be viewed as a circuit extension of spin-helix states, and are particularly suited for experimental investigations.

Title: A note on the physical interpretation of neural PDE's
Authors: Sauro Succi
Abstract: We highlight a formal and substantial analogy between Machine Learning (ML) algorithms and discrete dynamical systems (DDS) in relaxation form. The analogy offers a transparent interpretation of the weights in terms of physical information-propagation processes and identifies the model function of the forward ML step with the local attractor of the corresponding discrete dynamics. Besides improving the explainability of current ML applications, this analogy may also facilitate the development of a new class ML algorithms with a reduced number of weights.

Title: Universal relations and bounds for fluctuations in quasistatic small heat engines
Authors: Kosuke Ito, Guo-Hua Xu, Chao Jiang, Édgar Roldán, Raúl A. Rica-Alarcón, Ignacio A. Martínez, Gentaro Watanabe
Abstract: The efficiency of any heat engine, defined as the ratio of average work output to heat input, is bounded by Carnot's celebrated result. However, this measure is insufficient to characterize the properties of miniaturized heat engines carrying non-negligible fluctuations, and a study of higher-order statistics of their energy exchanges is required. Here, we generalize Carnot's result for reversible cycles to arbitrary order moment of the work and heat fluctuations. Our results show that, in the quasistatic limit, higher-order statistics of a small engine's energetics depend solely on the ratio between the temperatures of the thermal baths. We further prove that our result for the second moment gives universal bounds for the ratio between the variances of work and heat for quasistatic cycles. We test this theory with our previous experimental results of a Brownian Carnot engine and observe the consistency between them, even beyond the quasistatic regime. Our results can be exploited in the design of thermal nanomachines to reduce their fluctuations of work output without marginalizing its average value and efficiency.

Title: Electrostatic field-driven supercurrent suppression in ionic-gated metallic Josephson nanotransistors
Authors: Federico Paolucci, Francesco Crisà, Giorgio De Simoni, Lennart Bours, Claudio Puglia, Elia Strambini, Stefano Roddaro, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown the possibility of tuning the transport properties of metallic nanosized superconductors through a gate voltage. These results renewed the longstanding debate on the interaction between electrostatic fields and superconductivity. Indeed, different works suggested competing mechanisms as the cause of the effect: an unconventional electric field-effect or quasiparticle injection. Here, we provide conclusive evidence for the electrostatic-field-driven control of the supercurrent in metallic nanosized superconductors, by realizing ionic-gated superconducting field-effect nanotransistors (ISFETs) where electron injection is impossible. Our Nb ISFETs show giant suppression of the superconducting critical current of up to 45%. Moreover, the bipolar supercurrent suppression observed in different ISFETs, together with invariant critical temperature and normal-state resistance, also excludes conventional charge accumulation/depletion. Therefore, the microscopic explanation of this effect calls upon a novel theory able to describe the nontrivial interaction of static electric fields with conventional superconductivity.

Title: Token-driven totally asymmetric simple exclusion process
Authors: Bor Kavčič, Gašper Tkačik
Abstract: We consider a family of totally asymmetric simple exclusion processes (TASEPs), consisting of particles on a lattice that require binding by a "token" in various physical configurations to advance over the lattice. Using a combination of theory and simulations, we address the following questions: (i) How token binding kinetics affects the current-density relation on the lattice; (ii) How this current-density relation depends on the scarcity of tokens; (iii) How tokens propagate the effects of the locally-imposed disorder (such as a slow site) over the entire lattice; (iv) How a shared pool of tokens couples concurrent TASEPs running on multiple lattices; (v) How our results translate to TASEPs with open boundaries that exchange particles with the reservoir. Since real particle motion (including in biological systems that inspired the standard TASEP model, e.g., protein synthesis or movement of molecular motors) is often catalyzed, regulated, actuated, or otherwise mediated, the token-driven TASEP dynamics analyzed in this paper should allow for a better understanding of real systems and enable a closer match between TASEP theory and experimental observations.

Title: PT-Symmetry Breaking Transitions in Polymeric Systems
Authors: Tanmoy Pal, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: We show that classical DNA unzipping transition which is equivalently described by quantum mechanical localization-delocalization transition in the ground state of non-Hermitian single impurity Hatano-Nelson Hamiltonian is underpinned by generalized parity ({\bf P})-time reversal ({\bf T}) symmetry breaking transition. We also study the one-dimensional discretized version of Hatano-Nelson model in the presence of the single impurity and random disorder on a finite-size lattice. These discrete models are useful to study unzipping of a single adsorbed polymer from a surface. Our results show that the discrete models also undergo a phase transition from a PT unbroken phase to a broken phase. Interestingly, the generalized PT phase transition points coincide with the localization-delocalization transition for continuum as well as lattice models.

Title: Kondo $s$-$d$ exchange in the CuO$_2$ plane as the long sought interaction determining $T_c$ in cuprates
Authors: Todor M. Mishonov, Albert M. Varonov
Abstract: The well-known Pavarini et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 87, 047003 (2001)] correlation between the critical temperature $T_{c,\,\mathrm{max}}$ and the shape of the Fermi contour of the optimally hole-doped cuprates is explained within the framework of the BCS theory with Kondo exchange interaction incorporated as a pairing mechanism. The strong influence of the relative position of the Cu4$s$ level with respect to the Cu3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ level on the critical temperature $T_c$ reveals why the $s$-$d$ hybridization of the conduction band is so important. This hybridization is proportional to the $s$-$d$ exchange scattering amplitude between the conduction electrons -- the mechanism of d-wave pairing in the CuO$_2$ plane. In other words the Kondo interaction considered as a pairing mechanism in the CuO$_2$ plane gives a natural explanation of the correlation between the critical temperature and the shape of the Fermi contour. We have a hint that possibly the long sought pairing mechanism has possibly been found and the Kondo exchange interaction as a property of strongly correlated quantum matter deserves further attention in the physics of layered cuprates.

Title: Electrical detection of interfacial exchange field at the (ferromagnetic insulator)|(normal metal) interface using spin-dependent scattering
Authors: Prasanta Muduli, Naëmi Leo, Mingran Xu, Zheng Zhu, Jorge Puebla, Christian Ortiz, Hironari Isshiki, YoshiChika Otani
Abstract: The spin-orbit field and interfacial exchange field are two major interface phenomena, and the detection and manipulation of these fields can enable a variety of nanoscale spintronics devices. Optimizing the interfacial exchange field, which governs the spin-dependent scattering asymmetry at (ferromagnetic insulator)-(normal metal) interfaces, will pave the way for next-generation nanoscale, low-power insulator spintronics devices. Here, we demonstrate an experimental pathway to detect an interfacial exchange field between insulating ferromagnet EuS and non-magnetic Cu using an all-electrical method, and show that the spin-dependent scattering at the common interface can lead to a significant current-in-plane magnetoresistance in Py|Cu|EuS trilayer Hall-bar devices. Our experiment suggests that simple measurements can be used to experimentally detect the interfacial exchange field and thereby the magnetic state of a ferromagnetic insulator.

Title: Free fermions with dephasing and boundary driving: Bethe Ansatz results
Authors: Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: By employing the Lindblad equation, we derive the evolution of the two-point correlator for a free-fermion chain of length $L$ subject to bulk dephasing and boundary losses. We use the Bethe ansatz to diagonalize the Liouvillian ${\mathcal L}^{\scriptscriptstyle(2)}$ governing the dynamics of the correlator. The majority of its energy levels are complex. Precisely, $L(L-1)/2$ complex energies do not depend on dephasing, apart for a trivial shift. The remaining complex levels are perturbatively related to the dephasing-independent ones for large $L$. The long-time dynamics is governed by a band of real energies, which contains an extensive number of levels. They give rise to diffusive scaling at intermediate times, when boundaries can be neglected. Moreover, they encode the breaking of diffusion at asymptotically long times. Interestingly, for large loss rate two boundary modes appear in the spectrum. The real energies correspond to string solutions of the Bethe equations, and can be treated effectively for large chains. This allows us to derive compact formulas for the dynamics of the fermionic density. We check our results against exact diagonalization, finding perfect agreement.

Title: Correlation between the strength of low-temperature T-linear normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Xingyu Ma, Minghuan Zeng, Huaiming Guo, Shiping Feng
Abstract: The recently observed an intimate link between the nature of the strange metallic normal-state and superconductivity in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is calling for an explanation. Here the intrinsic correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped electron-doped cuprate superconductors is studied within the framework of the kinetic-energy-driven superconductivity. On the one hand, the main ingredient is identified into a electron pairing mechanism involving the spin excitation, and then $T_{\rm c}$ has a dome-like shape doping dependence with the maximal $T_{\rm c}$ that occurs at around the optimal electron doping. On the other hand, in the normal-state above $T_{\rm c}$, the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity in the overdoped regime arises from the momentum relaxation due to the electron umklapp scattering mediated by the same spin excitation. This same spin excitation that governs both the electron umklapp scattering responsible for the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and electron pairing responsible for superconductivity naturally generates a correlation between the strength of the low-temperature linear-in-temperature normal-state resistivity and $T_{\rm c}$ in the overdoped regime.

Title: Graphene-like nanoribbons connected by four-/five- membered rings on pentacene/picene precursors, Au(110) surface
Authors: Yu Yao, Yu Wang, Shuangxiang Wu, Qiang Zhang, Yifan Wang, Hui Zhang
Abstract: The rapid development of fabrication of functional high-quality graphene-like nanoribbons has increasingly reliant on integration of diverse nanofabrication platforms. The demand for innovative techniques to enable the exploration and precise manipulation of graphene-like nanoribbons. Herein, we present an on-surface synthesis approach for graphene-like nanoribbons, achieved through the self-assembly and annealing of pentacene/picene monomers on an one-dimensional(1D) Au(110) substrate. Scanning tunneling microscope(STM) analysis reveals that the formation of four- and eight- membered rings between adjacent molecules. Furthermore, we demonstrate a technique for manipulating pentacene dimer without breaking structural integrity by STM tip manipulation. Our results exhibit a potential platform for the development of next-generation graphene-based quantum computing architectures, as well as a technique for fabricating functional graphene-like nanoribbons with exceptional precision.

Title: Spin-valley locked excited states spectroscoy in a one-particle bilayer graphene quantum dot

Abstract: Current semiconductor qubits rely either on the spin or on the charge degree of freedom to encode quantum information. By contrast, in bilayer graphene the valley degree of freedom, stemming from the crystal lattice symmetry, is a robust quantum number that can therefore be harnessed for this purpose. The simplest implementation of a valley qubit would rely on two states with opposite valleys as in the case of a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot immersed in a small perpendicular magnetic field ($B_\perp\lesssim 100$mT). However, the single-carrier quantum dot excited states spectrum has not been resolved to date in the relevant magnetic field range. Here, we fill this gap, by measuring the parallel and perpendicular magnetic field dependence of this spectrum with an unprecedented resolution of $4\mu$eV. We use a time-resolved charge detection technique that gives us access to individual tunnel events. Our results come as a direct verification of the predicted spectrum and establish a new upper-bound on inter-valley mixing, equal to our energy resolution. Our charge detection technique opens the door to measuring the relaxation time of a valley qubit in a single-carrier bilayer graphene quantum dot.

Title: Filling-dependent intertwined electronic and atomic orders in the flat-band state of 1T-TaS2
Authors: Yanyan Geng, Haoyu Dong, Renhong Wang, Jianfeng Guo, Shuo Mi, Le Lei, Yan Li, Li Huang, Fei Pang, Rui Xu, Weiqiang Yu, Wei Ji, Hong-Jun Gao, Weichang Zhou, Zhihai Cheng
Abstract: The delicate interplay among the complex intra-/inter-layer electron-electron and electron-lattice interactions is the fundamental prerequisite of these exotic quantum states, such as superconductivity, nematic order, and checkerboard charge order. Here we explore the filling-dependent multiple stable intertwined electronic and atomic orders of flat-band state of 1T-TaS2 encompassing hole order, phase orders, coexisting left- and right-chiral orders and mixed phase/chiral orders via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). Combining first-principles calculations, the emergent electronic/atomic orders can be attributed to the weakening of electron-electron correlations and stacking-dependent interlayer interactions. Moreover, achiral intermediate ring-like clusters and nematic charge density wave (CDW) states are successfully realized in intralayer chiral domain wall and interlayer heterochiral stacking regions through chiral overlap configurations. Our study not only deepens the understanding of filling-dependent electronic/atomic orders in flat-band systems, but also offers perspectives for exploring exotic quantum states in correlated electronic systems.

Title: Operator Growth in Disordered Spin Chains: Indications for the Absence of Many-Body Localization
Authors: A. Weisse, R. Gerstner, J. Sirker
Abstract: We consider the spreading of a local operator $A$ in one-dimensional systems with Hamiltonian $H$ by calculating the $k$-fold commutator $[H,[H,[...,[H,A]]]]$. We derive bounds for the operator norm of this commutator in free and interacting systems with and without disorder thus directly connecting the operator growth hypothesis with questions of localization. We analytically show that an almost factorial growth of the operator norm - as recently proven for the random Ising model - is inconsistent with an exponential localization of $A$. Assuming that a quasi-local unitary $U$ exists which maps $H$ onto an effective Hamiltonian $\tilde H=UHU^\dagger=\sum_n E_n \tau^z_n +\sum_{i,j} J_{ij} \tau^z_i\tau^z_j+\dots$, we show that $\tilde A=UAU^\dagger$ is a quasi-local operator which in the many-body case does not remain exponentially localized in general leading to an almost factorial norm growth. Therefore the unitary $U$ in many-body systems with maximal norm growth either does not exist and such systems are always ergodic or unusual non-ergodic phases described by $\tilde H$ do exist which violate the operator growth hypothesis and in which operators spread, implying that transport will eventually set in. We analytically and symbolically verify our results for the Anderson and Aubry-André models. For the XXX case, the symbolic calculations are consistent with a maximal norm growth. Furthermore, we find no indication of a weakened exponential localization of $A$, expected for strong disorder and low commutator orders if the unitary $U$ does exist. Finally, we try to perturbatively construct $U$ by consecutive Schrieffer-Wolff transformations. While it is straightforward to show that this construction converges in the Anderson case, we find no indications for a convergence in the interacting case, suggesting that $U$ does not exist and that many-body localization is absent.

Title: Fluidization and anomalous density fluctuations in 2D Voronoi cell tissues with pulsating activity
Authors: Zhu-Qin Li, Qun-Li Lei, Yu-qiang Ma
Abstract: Cells not only can be motile by crawling but are also capable of non-motility active motions like periodic contraction or pulsation. In this work, based on a Voronoi cell model, we show how this non-motility activity affects the structure, dynamic and density fluctuations of cellular monolayers. Our model shows that random cell pulsation fluidizes solid epithelial tissues into a hyperuniform fluid state, while pulsation synchronization inhibits the fluidity and causes a reverse solidification. Our results indicate this solidification is a BKT-type transition, characterized by strong density/dynamic heterogeneity arising from the annihilation of topological defects in the pulsating phase space. The magnitude and length scale of density heterogeneity diverge with the pulsating period, resulting in an opposite giant density fluctuation or anti-hyperuniformity. We propose a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that can unify the two opposite anomalous fluctuation phenomena. Our findings can help to understand recent experimental observations in MDCK monolayer.

Title: Intrinsic constraint on $T_c$ for unconventional superconductivity
Authors: Qiong Qin, Yi-feng Yang
Abstract: Can room temperature superconductivity be achieved in correlated materials under ambient pressure? Our answer to this billion-dollar question is probably no, at least for realistic models within the current theoretical framework. This is shown by our systematic simulations on the pairing instability of some effective models for two-dimensional superconductivity. For a square lattice model with nearest-neighbour pairing, we find a plaquette state formed of weakly-connected $2\times2$ blocks for sufficiently large pairing interaction. The superconductivity is suppressed on both sides away from its melting quantum critical point. Thus, the magnitude of $T_c$ is constrained by the plaquette state for the $d$-wave superconductivity, in resemblance of other competing orders. We then extend our simulations to a variety of effective models covering nearest-neighbour or onsite pairings, single layer or two-layer structures, intralayer or interlayer pairings, and find an intrinsic maximum of the ratio $T_c/J\approx 0.04-0.07$, where $J$ is the pairing interaction. Comparison with existing experiments supports this constraint in cuprate, iron-based, nickelate, and heavy fermion superconductors, despite that these compounds are so complicated well beyond our simplified models. As a result, the known families of unconventional superconductivity, possibly except the infinite-layer nickelates, seem to almost exhaust their potentials in reaching the maximal $T_c$ allowed by their respective $J$, while achieving room temperature superconductor would require a much larger $J$ beyond 400-700 meV, which seems unrealistic in existing correlated materials and hence demands novel pairing mechanisms. The agreement also implies some deep underlying principles of the constraint that urge for a more rigorous theoretical understanding.

Title: The influence of Structural Dynamics in Two-Dimensional Hybrid Organic-Inorganic Perovskites on their Photoluminescence Efficiency -- Neutron scattering analysis
Authors: Haritha Sindhu Rajeev, Xiao Hu, Wei-Liang Chen, Depei Zhang, Tianran Chen, Maiko Kofu, Ryoichi Kajimoto, Mitsutaka Nakamura, Alexander Z. Chen, Grayson C. Johnson, Mina Yoon, Yu-Ming Chang, Diane A. Dickie, Joshua J. Choi, Seung-Hun Lee
Abstract: Two-dimensional hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) have emerged as promising materials for light-emitting diode applications. In this study, by using time-of-flight neutron spectroscopy we identified and quantitatively separated the lattice vibrational and molecular rotational dynamics of two perovskites, butylammonium lead iodide (BA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$ and phenethyl-ammonium lead iodide (PEA)$_{2}$PbI$_{4}$. By examining the corresponding temperature dependence, we found that the lattice vibrations, as evidenced by neutron spectra, are consistent with the lattice dynamics obtained from Raman scattering. We revealed that the rotational dynamics of organic molecules in these materials tend to suppress their photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) while the vibrational dynamics did not show predominant correlations with the same. Additionally, we observed photoluminescence emission peak splitting for both systems, which becomes prominent above certain critical temperatures where the suppression of PLQY begins. This study suggests that the rotational motions of polarized molecules may lead to a reduction in exciton binding energy or the breaking of degeneracy in exciton binding energy levels, enhancing non-radiative recombination rates, and consequently reducing photoluminescence yield. These findings offer a deeper understanding of fundamental interactions in 2D HOIPs and could guide the design of more efficient light-emitting materials for advanced technological applications.

Title: Regulation of electronic structures in ReSeS monolayer with anisotropic deformations
Authors: T. T. Lin, J. W. Ma, H. C. Deng, L. Z. Liu
Abstract: Because of their unique and rich physical properties, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) materials have attracted much interest. Many studies suggest that introducing the degree of freedom of anisotropy, which may be brought about by low structural symmetry, might further optimize their applications in industry and manufacturing. However, most currently reported TMDs do not achieve the theoretical minimum symmetry. Utilizing the first principles calculation, we present ReSeS monolayer with a Janus structure. Results indicate that its electronic dispersion is sensitive to structural distortions, which increases metallicity. Our reduction-Hamiltonian can provide a qualitative description, but further analyses reveal that bonding/antibonding properties near the Fermi surface are the more fundamental cause of the variations. Furthermore, geometric deformations can regulate the effective mass of electrons as well as the spectroscopic response, resulting in anisotropic behaviors. Our ideas serve as a foundation for developing new regulable optoelectronic devices.

Title: Discrete time-crystals in unbounded potentials
Authors: Yevgeny Bar Lev, Achilleas Lazarides
Abstract: Discrete time crystalline phases have attracted significant theoretical and experimental attention in the last few years. Such systems require a seemingly impossible combination of nonadiabatic driving and a finite-entropy long-time state, which, surprisingly, is possible in nonergodic systems. Previous works have often relied on disorder for the required nonergodicity; here, we describe the construction of a discrete time crystal (DTC) phase in nondisordered, nonintegrable Ising-type systems. After discussing the conditions for interacting and periodically driven systems to display such phases in general, we propose a concrete model and then provide approximate analytical arguments and direct numerical evidence that it satisfies the conditions and displays a DTC phase robust to local periodic perturbations.

Title: Many-Body Localization in the Age of Classical Computing
Authors: Piotr Sierant, Maciej Lewenstein, Antonello Scardicchio, Lev Vidmar, Jakub Zakrzewski
Abstract: Statistical mechanics provides a framework for describing the physics of large, complex many-body systems using only a few macroscopic parameters to determine the state of the system. For isolated quantum many-body systems, such a description is achieved via the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), which links thermalization, ergodicity and quantum chaotic behavior. However, tendency towards thermalization is not observed at finite system sizes and evolution times in a robust many-body localization (MBL) regime found numerically and experimentally in the dynamics of interacting many-body systems at strong disorder. Although the phenomenology of the MBL regime is well-established, the central question remains unanswered: under what conditions does the MBL regime give rise to an MBL phase in which the thermalization does not occur even in the asymptotic limit of infinite system size and evolution time? This review focuses on recent numerical investigations aiming to clarify the status of the MBL phase, and it establishes the critical open questions about the dynamics of disordered many-body systems. Persistent finite size drifts towards ergodicity consistently emerge in spectral properties of disordered many-body systems, excluding naive single-parameter scaling hypothesis and preventing comprehension of the status of the MBL phase. The drifts are related to tendencies towards thermalization and non-vanishing transport observed in the dynamics of many-body systems, even at strong disorder. These phenomena impede understanding of microscopic processes at the ETH-MBL crossover. Nevertheless, the abrupt slowdown of dynamics with increasing disorder strength suggests the proximity of the MBL phase. This review concludes that the questions about thermalization and its failure in disordered many-body systems remain a captivating area open for further explorations.

Title: Motility-induced mixing transition in exponentially growing multicellular spheroids
Authors: Torben Sunkel, Lukas Hupe, Philip Bittihn
Abstract: Growth drives cellular dynamics in dense aggregates including bacterial colonies, developing tissues, and tumors. We investigate the underlying physical principles emerging from the interplay of growth, steric repulsion, and motility in a minimal agent-based model of exponentially growing, three-dimensional spheroids. Our results reveal a motility-induced mixing transition: Without motility, deterministic radial motion from volume expansion dominates, while growth and division cause tangential, cellular-scale diffusion, largely independent of expansion velocity. Despite this small-scale diffusion, cell lineages remain confined to their local environment. This confinement persists at weak motility and is overcome only above a threshold, leading to tangential superdiffusivity and global cell mixing with a diverging timescale near the transition, reminiscent of glassy dynamics. Using a phenomenological model, we identify two effects governing this transition: Steric interactions that suppress motility-induced velocity below a threshold, and the expanding nature of the system which inhibits complete mixing. Our study highlights the complex interaction of local cell division and motility with global expansion, mediated exclusively by mechanics. The results provide a baseline for identifying additional biological mechanisms in experiments, for example in tissue spheroids. The mixing dynamics might also be relevant for competition or tumor progression by interacting with genetic heterogeneity.

Title: Sampling Electronic Fock States using Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Shuhan Ding, Shaozhi Li, Yao Wang
Abstract: Analog quantum simulation based on ultracold atoms in optical lattices has catalyzed significant breakthroughs in the study of quantum many-body systems. These simulations rely on the statistical sampling of electronic Fock states, which are not easily accessible in classical algorithms. In this work, we modify the determinant quantum Monte Carlo by integrating a Fock-state update mechanism alongside the auxiliary field. This method enables efficient sampling of Fock-state configurations. The Fock-state restrictive sampling scheme further enables the pre-selection of multiple ensembles at no additional computational cost, thereby broadening the scope of simulation to more general systems and models. Employing this method, we analyze static correlations of the Hubbard model up to the fourth order and achieve quantitative agreement with cold-atom experiments. The simulations of dynamical spectroscopies of the Hubbard and Kondo-lattice models further demonstrate the reliability and advantage of this method.

Title: Electrical control of a Kondo spin screening cloud

Abstract: Quantitative analysis of quantum many-body systems, consisting of numerous itinerant electrons that interact with localized spins or electrons, is a long-standing issue. The Kondo cloud, a quantum many-body object of conduction electrons that screens a single localized spin, is the building block of such strongly correlated electronic systems. While quantitative analysis of the Kondo cloud associated with a single magnetic impurity is well established for uniform conduction electrons, the fundamental properties of a deformed Kondo cloud influenced by conduction electrons with a modulated density of states remain unsolved. Here we report engineering of the Kondo cloud deformation by confining a part of the cloud into a quantum box called the Kondo box that mimics realistic material systems. We demonstrate quantitative control of the Kondo cloud by developing a way of tuning quantum interference in the box and monitoring the Kondo entanglement. The temperature dependence of the entanglement reveals counterintuitively that the cloud shape is altered mainly outside the box although the quantum interference in the box is tuned. Our work provides a way to simulate various strongly correlated systems by integrating the Kondo cloud, which is not possible in the current theoretical framework.

Title: Chemical interactions in active droplets
Authors: Prateek Dwivedi, Sobiya Ashraf, Pawan Kumar, Dipin Pillai, Rahul Mangal
Abstract: Interactions among biologically active agents is facilitated by their self-generated chemical and hydrodynamic fields. In order to elucidate the pair-wise interactions between such micro-organisms, we employ active droplets as a model system, capable of self-generating chemical and hydrodynamic fields. We demonstrate that the solute Péclet number ($Pe$), characterizing the relative strength of its convective to diffusive transport, plays a crucial role in determining how the chemical and hydrodynamic fields impact their interactions. Our findings reveal that at low $Pe$, the interaction is predominantly governed by chemo-repulsive effects, leading to droplets avoiding physical contact. Conversely, at elevated $Pe$, hydrodynamic interactions become more influential, leading to physical engagement. However, irrespective of $Pe$, the interaction of a droplet with the chemical trail of another droplet is always governed by chemo-repulsive effects. Furthermore, our results establish that the chemo-repulsive deflection/rebounding of droplets is influenced by the droplets' inherent chemical polarity, as determined by its $Pe$, independent of their approach orientation. Our findings offer a methodology for tuning the outcomes of binary interactions among chemically active droplets, laying the groundwork for potential studies on their collective dynamics.

Title: Self-induced spin pumping and inverse spin Hall effect in single FePt thin films
Authors: J. L. Ampuero, A. Anadón, H. Damas, J. Ghanbaja, S. Petit-Watelot, J.-C. Rojas-Sánchez, D. Velázquez Rodriguez, J. E. Gómez, A. Butera, L. Avilés-Félix
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the spin-charge current conversion characteristics of chemically disordered ferromagnetic single FePt thin films by spin-pumping ferromagnetic resonance experiments performed on both a resonance cavity and on patterned devices. We clearly observe a self-induced signal in a single FePt layer. The sign of a single FePt spin pumping voltage signal is consistent with a typical bilayer with a positive spin Hall angle layer such as that of Pt on top of a ferromagnet (FM), substrate//FM/Pt. Structural analysis shows a strong composition gradient due to natural oxidation at both FePt interfaces, with the Si substrate and with the air. The FePt-thickness dependence of the self-induced charge current produced allowed us to obtain $\lambda _ \text{FePt}=(1.5\pm 0.1)$ nm and self-induced $\theta_ \text{self-FePt}=0.047 \pm 0.003$, with efficiency for reciprocal effects applications $\theta _ \text{self-FePt} \times \lambda _ \text{FePt} = 0.071$ nm which is comparable to that of Pt, $\theta _ \text{SH-Pt} \times \lambda _ \text{Pt} = 0.2$ nm. Moreover, by studying bilayer systems such as Si//FePt/Pt and Si//Pt//FePt we independently could extract the individual contributions of the external inverse spin Hall effect of Pt and the self-induced inverse spin Hall effect of FePt. Notably, this method gives consistent values of charge currents produced due to only self-induced inverse spin Hall effect in FePt layers. These results advance our understanding of spin-to-charge interconversion mechanisms in composite thin films and pave the way for the development of next-generation spintronics devices based on self-torque.

Title: Distinguishing Majorana bound states from Andreev bound states through differential conductance and current noise spectrum
Authors: Huajin Zhao, Junrong Wang, Hong Mao, Jinshuang Jin
Abstract: We investigate the quantum transport through a quantum dot coupled with a superconducting (SC) nanowire. By elaborating the differential conductance and current noise spectrum, we focus on the distinct characteristics of the topological Majorana bound states (MBSs) and trivial Andereev bound states (ABSs) hosted in SC wire. For MBSs with a topological quality factor $q=1$, we observe the degenerate features manifested as the zero-bias peak (ZBP) in differential conductance and the Rabi dips degeneracy (RDD) in noise spectrum. In contrast, for ABSs with $q<1$, the splitting of these degenerate features depends on the linewidth, arising from realistic measurement conditions. Furthermore, we identify the critical quality factors $q_{\rm c}$ and $q_{\rm s}$ associated with the emergences of ZBP and RDD, respectively. The value of $q_{\rm c}$ is temperature-dependent, and we establish a suitable temperature window to ensure the visibility of single ZBP in the experiments. Whereas, $q_{\rm c}$ depends on the coupling strength rather than the temperature. Typical values for these quality factors are approximately $q_{\rm c}\approx 0.93$ and $q_{\rm s}\approx 0.99$. Our results suggest that the degenerate Rabi spectrum signal could serve as a hallmark for the presence of MBSs, which goes beyond the scope of differential conductance.

Title: On the build-up of effective hyperuniformity from large globular colloidal aggregates
Authors: Antonio Díaz-Pozuelo, Diego González-Salgado, Enrique Lomba
Abstract: A simple three-dimensional model of a fluid whose constituent particles interact via a short range attractive and long range repulsive potential is used to model the aggregation into large spherical-like clusters made up of hundreds of particles. The model can be thought of as a straightforward rendition of colloid flocculation into large spherical aggregates. We illustrate how temperature and particle density influence the cluster size distribution and affect inter- and intra-cluster dynamics. The system is shown to exhibit two well separated length and time scales, which can be tuned by the balance between repulsive and attractive forces. Interestingly, cluster aggregates at moderate/low temperatures approach a cluster glassy phase whereas cluster particles retain a local liquid-like structure. These states present a strong suppression of density fluctuations for a significant range of relatively large wavelengths, meeting the criterion of effective disordered hyperuniform materials as far as the intercluster structure is concerned.

Title: Ferromagnets, a New Anomaly, Instantons, and (noninvertible) Continuous Translations
Authors: Nathan Seiberg
Abstract: We discuss a large class of classical field theories with continuous translation symmetry. In the quantum theory, a new anomaly explicitly breaks this translation symmetry to a discrete symmetry. Furthermore, this discrete translation symmetry is extended by a $d-2$-form global symmetry. All these theories can be described as $U(1)$ gauge theories where Gauss law states that the system has nonzero charge density. Special cases of such systems can be phrased as theories with a compact phase space. Examples are ferromagnets and lattices in the lowest Landau level. In some cases, the broken continuous translation symmetry can be resurrected as a noninvertible symmetry. We clarify the relation between the discrete translation symmetry of the continuum theory and the discrete translation symmetry of an underlying lattice model. Our treatment unifies, clarifies, and extends earlier works on the same subject.

Title: Fluctuations of dynamical observables in linear diffusions with time delay: a Riccati-based approach
Authors: M.L. Rosinberg, G. Tarjus, T. Munakata
Abstract: Our current understanding of fluctuations of dynamical (time-integrated) observables in non- Markovian processes is still very limited. A major obstacle is the lack of an appropriate theoretical framework to evaluate the associated large deviation functions. In this paper we bypass this difficulty in the case of linear diffusions with time delay by using a Markovian embedding procedure that introduces an infinite set of coupled differential equations. We then show that the generating functions of current-type observables can be computed at arbitrary finite time by solving matrix Riccati differential equations (RDEs) somewhat similar to those encountered in optimal control and filtering problems. By exploring in detail the properties of these RDEs and of the corresponding continuous-time algebraic Riccati equations (CAREs), we identify the generic fixed point towards which the solutions converge in the long-time limit. This allows us to derive the explicit expressions of the scaled cumulant generating function (SCGF), of the pre-exponential factors, and of the effective (or driven) process that describes how fluctuations are created dynamically. Finally, we describe the special behavior occurring at the limits of the domain of existence of the SCGF, in connection with fluctuation relations for the heat and the entropy production.

Title: Entanglement Randomness and Gapped Itinerant Carriers in a Frustrated Quantum Magnet
Authors: Luke Pritchard Cairns, Yuanqi Lyu, Chunxiao Liu, Josue Rodriguez, Kenneth Ng, John Singleton, James G. Analytis
Abstract: The quantum spin liquid (QSL) is a state manifesting extraordinary many-body entanglement, and the material NaYbSe$_2$ is thought to be one of the most promising candidates for its realization. Through low-temperature heat capacity and thermal conductivity measurements we identify an apparent contradiction familiar to many QSL candidates: while entropy is stored by apparently gapless excitations, the itinerant carriers of entropy are gapped. By studying the compositional series NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ across a percolation transition of the magnetic lattice, we suggest that this contradiction can be resolved by the presence of entanglement scales of random sizes. Moreover, as we truncate the scale of entanglement by magnetic dilution, we show that the itinerant magnetic entropy carrier in NaYb$_x$Lu$_{1-x}$Se$_2$ is not the result of long-range entanglement but rather depends on the propagation of the simplest entangled object of all: the spin dimer.

Title: Interaction-induced topological phase transition at finite temperature
Authors: Ze-Min Huang, Sebastian Diehl
Abstract: We demonstrate the existence of topological phase transitions in interacting, symmetry-protected quantum matter at finite temperatures. Using a combined numerical and analytical approach, we study a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with added Hubbard interactions, where no thermodynamic phase transition occurs at finite temperatures. The transition is signalled by a quantized, non-local bulk topological order parameter. It is driven by defects, which are enabled by the combination of interaction and thermal activation, with no counterpart in the non-interacting limit. The defects localize topological zero modes, which, when sufficiently abundant, cause the order parameter to vanish. This phenomenon, interpreted via bulk-boundary correspondence, reflects the loss of a topological edge mode at a well-defined critical temperature in the thermodynamic limit. Unlike zero-temperature topological transitions, these finite-temperature transitions lack thermodynamic signatures but remain observable in controlled quantum systems, such as ultracold fermionic atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Quantum Supercritical Crossover with Dynamical Singularity
Authors: Junsen Wang, Enze Lv, Xinyang Li, Yuliang Jin, Wei Li
Abstract: Supercritical states, characterized by strong fluctuations and intriguing phenomena, emerge above the critical point. In this study, we extend this notable concept of supercriticality from classical to quantum systems near the quantum critical point, by studying the one- and two-dimensional quantum Ising models through tensor network calculations and scaling analyses. We reveal the existence of quantum supercritical (QSC) crossover lines, determined by not only response functions but also quantum information quantities. A supercritical scaling law, $h \sim (g - g_c)^{\Delta}$, is revealed, where $g$ ($h$) is the transverse (longitudinal) field, $g_c$ is the critical field, and $\Delta$ is a critical exponent. Moreover, we uncover the QSC crossover line defines a boundary for the dynamical singularity to appear in quench dynamics, which can be ascribed to the intersection between the Lee-Yang zero line and the real-time axis. In particular, when the Hamiltonian parameter is quenched to the QSC crossover line, a singular cusp with exponent 1/2 emerge in the Loschmidt rate function, signaling a new dynamical universality class different from the linear cusp for $h=0$. Possible platforms, such as quantum simulators and quantum magnets are proposed for studying QSC crossovers in experiments. Our work paves the way for exploring QSC crossovers in and out of equilibrium in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Gapless deconfined phase in a $\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetric Hamiltonian created in a cold-atom setup
Authors: Mykhailo V. Rakov, Luca Tagliacozzo, Maciej Lewenstein, Jakub Zakrzewski, Titas Chanda
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-two-dimensional system consisting of two species of alkali atoms confined in a specific optical lattice potential [Phys. Rev. A 95, 053608 (2017)]. In the low-energy regime, this system is governed by a unique $\mathbb{Z}_N$ gauge theory, where field theory arguments have suggested that it may exhibit two exotic gapless deconfined phases, namely a dipolar liquid phase and a Bose liquid phase, along with two gapped (confined and deconfined) phases. We address these predictions numerically by using large-scale density matrix renormalization group simulations. Our findings provide conclusive evidence for the existence of a gapless Bose liquid phase for $N \geq 7$. We demonstrate that this gapless phase shares the same critical properties as one-dimensional critical phases, resembling weakly coupled chains of Luttinger liquids. In the range of ladder and cylinder geometries and $N$ considered, the gapless dipolar phase predicted theoretically is still elusive and its characterization will probably require a full two-dimensional treatment.

Title: Wannier center spectroscopy to identify boundary-obstructed topological insulators
Authors: R.A.M. Ligthart, M.A.J. Herrera, A. Visser, A. Vlasblom, D. Bercioux, I. Swart
Abstract: The hallmark of topological crystalline insulators is the emergence of a robust electronic state in a bandgap localized at the boundary of the material. However, end, edge, and surface states can also have a non-topological origin. Unfortunately, topological invariants such as the winding number and Zak-phase are often not directly experimentally accessible for solids. In addition to topological invariants, the position of the Wannier centers provides a fingerprint for the topological character of a material. Here, we demonstrate a method to experimentally determine the location of Wannier centers in artificial lattices made of Cs/InAs(111)A by integrating the density of states. We determine the locations of the Wannier centers for various 1D chains, topological and trivial, and corroborate our findings with tight-binding simulations.

Title: Time evolution of the local density of states of strongly correlated fermions coupled to a nanoprobe
Authors: Tobias Blum, Reinhard M. Noack, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: We study the time evolution of a one-dimensional system of strongly correlated electrons (a 'sample') that is suddenly coupled to a smaller, initially empty system (a 'nanoprobe'), which can subsequently move along the system. Our purpose here is to study the role of interactions in this model system when it is far from equilibrium. We therefore take both the sample and the nanoprobe to be described by a Hubbard model with on-site repulsive interactions and nearest-neighbor hopping. We compute the behavior of the local particle density and the local density of states (LDOS) as a function of time using time-dependent matrix product states at quarter and at half filling, fillings at which the chain realizes a Luttinger liquid or a Mott insulator, respectively. This allows us to study in detail the oscillation of the particles between the sample and the nanoprobe. While, for noninteracting systems, the LDOS is time-independent, in the presence of interactions, the backflow of electrons to the sample will lead to nontrivial dynamics in the LDOS. In particular, studying the time-dependent LDOS allows us to study how the Mott gap closes locally and how this melting of the Mott insulator propagates through the system in time after such a local perturbation -- a behavior that we envisage can be investigated in future experiments on ultrashort time scales or on optical lattices using microscopy setups.

Title: Engineering Interfaces with Electric and Magnetic Fields: A Comprehensive Review
Authors: Priyanka Biswas, Gaurav Pransu
Abstract: The spontaneous organization of particles at the boundary between two fluids is a common occurrence. Scientists have extensively investigated various internal and external factors to manipulate and guide these self-assembly processes. This review article centers on the impact of external fields, particularly electric and magnetic fields, on the self-assembly of intermediate-sized particles at interfaces. By modifying the shape and dimensions of particles, attractive forces can be precisely controlled. Furthermore, the intensity and orientation of external fields exert a substantial influence on the resulting assembled structure. These systems hold immense promise for groundbreaking applications in drug delivery, catalysis, and other transport mechanisms.

Title: Entanglement Generation and Stabilization by Coherent Collisions
Authors: A. Mert Bozkurt, Rosa López, Sungguen Ryu
Abstract: Collision is a useful tool for revealing quantum effects and realizing quantum informational tasks. We demonstrate that repeated collisions by itinerant electrons can dissipatively drive two remote spin qubits into an entangled state in a generic collisional framework. A coherent spin exchange with either qubit facilitates entanglement generation. When combined with proper local driving, these collisions induce an entangled steady state in most collision configurations. Particularly, the collision which is symmetric for the two qubits results in a unique steady state close to a maximally entangled state. Due to the dissipative nature of the process, the entanglement persists in the presence of decoherence, provided the collision frequency exceeds the decoherence rate. Our model can be experimentally implemented using single-electron sources.

Title: Detecting winding and Chern numbers in topological matter using spectral function
Authors: Kiran Babasaheb Estake, Dibyendu Roy
Abstract: We propose a method to directly probe bulk topological quantum numbers in topological matter by measuring the momentum-space single-particle spectral function (SPSF). Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) can detect SPSF and is often used to determine the bulk band structure of quantum materials. Here, we show that while one part of the momentum-space SPSF gives band structure, it also contains the knowledge of winding and Chern numbers of various topological materials. For this, we derive SPSF in different models of topological systems, such as the Kitaev model of topological superconductors, the long-range Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, the Qi-Wu-Zhang model, the Haldane model on a hexagonal lattice and a four-band model that is a physical realization of the Kitaev chain and explain how to extract the winding or Chern numbers in different topological phases from the SPSF. Such information from SPSF seems experimentally accessible due to the recent advancement of ARPES and scanning tunneling spectroscopy techniques. While the detection of bulk topological quantum numbers using the SPSF works well for one-dimensional systems, it has certain limitations for higher-dimensional systems, where it must be complementary with another measurement to ensure the matter under investigation is topological, i.e., having a non-zero Chern number.

Title: Macroscopic Thermalization for Highly Degenerate Hamiltonians After Slight Perturbation
Authors: Barbara Roos, Stefan Teufel, Roderich Tumulka, Cornelia Vogel
Abstract: We say of an isolated macroscopic quantum system in a pure state $\psi$ that it is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium if $\psi$ lies in or close to a suitable subspace $\mathcal{H}_{eq}$ of Hilbert space. It is known that every initial state $\psi_0$ will eventually reach macroscopic thermal equilibrium and stay there most of the time ("thermalize") if the Hamiltonian is non-degenerate and satisfies the appropriate version of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH), i.e., that every eigenvector is in macroscopic thermal equilibrium. Shiraishi and Tasaki recently proved the ETH for a certain perturbation $H_\theta$ of the Hamiltonian $H_0$ of $N\gg 1$ free fermions on a one-dimensional lattice. The perturbation is needed to remove the high degeneracies of $H_0$. Here, we point out that also for degenerate Hamiltonians, all $\psi_0$ thermalize if the ETH holds for every eigenbasis, and we prove that this is the case for $H_0$. On top of that and more generally, we develop another strategy of proving thermalization, inspired by the fact that there is one eigenbasis of $H_0$ for which ETH can be proven more easily and with smaller error bounds than for the others. This strategy applies to arbitrarily small generic perturbations $H$ of $H_0$ and to arbitrary spatial dimensions. In fact, we consider any given $H_0$, suppose that the ETH holds for some but not necessarily every eigenbasis of $H_0$, and add a small generic perturbation, $H=H_0+\lambda V$ with $\lambda\ll 1$. Then, although $H$ (which is non-degenerate) may still not satisfy the ETH, we show that nevertheless (i) every $\psi_0$ thermalizes for most perturbations $V$, and more generally, (ii) for any subspace $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ (such as corresponding to a non-equilibrium macro state), most perturbations $V$ are such that most $\psi_0$ from $\mathcal{H}_\nu$ thermalize.

Title: Microstructural characterization to reveal evidence of shock deformation in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment
Authors: Graeme J. Francolini, Thomas B. Britton
Abstract: The study of meteorites and their microstructures is a topic which spans multiple fields of research, such as meteoritics and materials science. For materials scientists and engineers, the extreme and unusual conditions which these microstructures form allow for insight into materials which would exist at the edge of our thermomechanical processing abilities. One such microstructure found in low-shock event iron meteorites is Neumann bands. These bands are an array of lenticular deformation twins that form throughout the Fe-Ni matrix with numerous intersections, resulting in many high stress and strain regions within the material's surface. The existence of these regions and the shocks that formed them encourage atypical strain accommodating mechanisms and structural changes of the material. However, direct investigation of the deformation twin intersections and the microstructural behaviour in and around these regions has been limited. In this work, investigation of these regions in a Campo del Cielo meteorite fragment, with electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) and forescatter electron (FSE) imaging, revealed two primary findings: high-intensity pattern doubling mirrored across the {110} band at twin-twin intersection and microband formation across the sample surface, which suggest multilayer twinning and constraint of the crystal structure at points of twin-twin intersection. Microbands were found to form along the {110} plane and in regions near Neumann bands. The simultaneous existence of Neumann bands (microtwins) and microbands is presented here for a BCC material, and it is believed the Neumann band and microbands formed during different types and/or shock events. The presence of both Neumann bands and microbands within a BCC iron meteorite is previously unreported and may be valuable in furthering our understanding of shock deformation within iron-based materials.

Title: Berry curvature and shift vector effects at high-order wave mixing in biased bilayer graphene
Authors: H.K. Avetissian, H.H. Matevosyan, G.F. Mkrtchian
Abstract: In this work, we present a microscopic quantum theory that elucidates the nonlinear and nonperturbative optical response of biased bilayer graphene subjected to bichromatic strong laser fields. This response is analyzed using a four-band Hamiltonian derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations. For the laser-stimulated dynamics, we employ structure gauge-invariant evolutionary equations to accurately describe the evolution of the single-particle density matrix across the entire Brillouin zone. The resonant generation of electron-hole pairs by the high-frequency component of the field, combined with the induction of high-order harmonic generation and high-order wave mixing by the strong low-frequency field component, leads to significant alterations in the resulting spectra. These changes are driven by the effects of Berry curvature and the shift vector, which modify the relative contributions of interband and intraband channels, thereby fundamentally reshaping the radiation spectra at high-order frequency multiplication. The numerical results are further supported by approximate analytical calculations, demonstrating that high-order wave mixing can be modeled using the classical trajectory analysis of electron-hole pairs, with Berry curvature and the shift vector significantly influencing the saddle-point equations.

Title: Duality via Sequential Quantum Circuit in the Topological Holography Formalism
Authors: Robijn Vanhove, Vibhu Ravindran, David T. Stephen, Xiao-Gang Wen, Xie Chen
Abstract: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.

Title: Many-body density of states of bosonic and fermionic gases: a combinatorial approach
Authors: Carolyn Echter, Georg Maier, Juan-Diego Urbina, Caio Lewenkopf, Klaus Richter
Abstract: We use a combinatorial approach to obtain exact expressions for the many-body density of states of fermionic and bosonic gases with equally spaced single-particle spectra. We identify a mapping that reveals a remarkable property, namely, fermionic and bosonic gases have the same many-body density of states, up to a shift corresponding to ground state energy. Additionally, we show that there is a regime, comprising the validity range of the Bethe approximation, where the many-body density of states becomes independent of the number of particles.

Title: Intrinsic threshold electric field for domain wall motion in ferroelectrics based on discretized phase-field model
Authors: Huanhuan Tian, Jianguo Yang, Ming Liu
Abstract: With the development of ferroelectric memories, it is becoming increasingly important to understand the ferroelectric switching behaviors at small applied electric fields. In this \rv{paper}, we use discretized phase-field models to systematically investigate the intrinsic threshold electric field (TEF) to drive flat 180$^\circ$ and 90$^\circ$ domain walls (DWs), which can not be captured by continuum models. The results show that this TEF increases as the ratio of DW width to unit cell size decreases, and it becomes significant if the DW width is thinner than two unit cells. The results are qualitatively consistent with existing first-principles studies and cryogenic experiments. In addition, this work proposes a conceptual model to explain the activation electric field (AEF) observed in experiments at room temperature. This work improves the understanding of DW motion kinetics at small applied fields, and shows that the mesh size and orientation are both important for the phase-field modeling of the above process.

Title: Nonlinear field dependence of Hall effect and high-mobility multi-carrier transport in an altermagnet CrSb
Authors: Yuqing Bai, Xinji Xiang, Shuang Pan, Shichao Zhang, Haifeng Chen Xi Chen, Zhida Han, Guizhou Xu, Feng Xu
Abstract: As a promising candidate for altermagnet, CrSb possesses a distinctive compensated spin split band structure that could bring groundbreaking concepts to the field of spintronics. In this work, we have grown high-quality CrSb single crystals and comprehensively investigated their electronic and magneto-transport properties. We have observed large, positive, and non-saturated magnetoresistance (MR) in CrSb, which well obeys Kohler's rule, indicating its classic Lorentz scattering origins. Remarkably, a nonlinear magnetic field dependence of Hall effect resembling the spontaneous anomalous Hall is identified over a wide temperature range. After careful analysis of the transport data, we conclude the non-linearity mainly stems from the incorporation of different carriers in the magnetoconductivity. According to the Fermi surface analyses of CrSb, we applied the three-carrier model to fit the conductivity data, yielding good agreement. The extracted carrier concentration and mobility indicates that CrSb behaves more like a semimetal, with the highest mobility reaching 3*103 cm2V-1s-1. Furthermore, calculations using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory have successfully reproduced the main features of the experimental MR and Hall effect in CrSb. These exceptional transport properties make CrSb unique for applications in spintronics as an altermagnet.

Title: Meta-Generalized-Gradient Approximation made Magnetic
Authors: Jacques K. Desmarais, Alessandro Erba, Giovanni Vignale, Stefano Pittalis
Abstract: The Jacob's ladder of density functional theory (DFT) proposes the compelling view that by extending the form of successful approximations -- being guided by exact conditions and selected (least empirical) norms -- upper rungs will do better than the lower, thus allowing to balance accuracy and computational effort. Meta-generalized-gradient-approximations (MGGAs) belong to the last rung of the semi-local approximations before hybridization with non-local wave function theories. Among the MGGAs, the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed Approximation (SCAN) greatly improves upon GGAs from the lower rung. But the over magnetized solutions of SCAN make GGAs more reliable for magnetism. Here, we provide a solution that satisfies the most pressing {\em desiderata} for density functional approximations for ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic and non-collinear states. The approach is available in an implementation in the \textsc{Crystal} electronic structure package.

Title: Transverse voltage in anisotropic hydrodynamic conductors
Authors: Kaize Wang, Chunyu Guo, Philip J.W. Moll, Tobias Holder
Abstract: Weak momentum dissipation in ultra-clean metals gives rise to novel non-Ohmic current flow, including ballistic and hydrodynamic regimes. Recently, hydrodynamic flow has attracted intense interest because it presents a valuable window into the electronic correlations and the longest lived collective modes of quantum materials. However, diagnosing viscous flow is difficult as the macroscopic observables of ballistic and hydrodynamic transport such as the average current distribution can be deceptively similar, even if their respective microscopics deviate notably. Based on kinetic Boltzmann theory, here we propose to address this issue via the transverse channel voltage at zero magnetic field, which can efficiently detect hydrodynamic flow in a number of materials. To this end, we show that the transverse voltage is sensitive to the interplay between anisotropic fermiology and boundary scattering, resulting in a non-trivial behavior in narrow channels along crystalline low-symmetry directions. We discuss several materials where the channel-size dependent stress of the quantum fluid leads to a characteristic sign change of the transverse voltage as a new hallmark of the cross-over from the ballistic to the hydrodynamic regime.

Title: Structurally induced magnetic transitions in layered dichalcogenides MoQ2 (Q = S, Se, Te) and double hydroxides (M2+)6Al3(OH)18[Na(H2O)6](SO4)2 6H2O (M2+ = Mn2+, Fe2+) under mechanical deformation
Authors: L.M. Volkova
Abstract: Exploring how mechanical strain can modify the magnetic properties of low-dimensional structures is one of the priorities of straintronics, an area in condensed matter physics. It has been proven by calculating the parameters of magnetic interactions Jij and developing structural/magnetic models of the layered dichalcogenides MoS2, MoSe2, MoTe2 and layered double hydroxides (M2+)6Al3(OH)18[Na(H2O)6](SO4)2 6H2O (M2+ = Mn2+, Fe2+) with a grapheme type structure that magnetic interactions are responsive to the mechanical deformation of their crystal structure. As turned out, the ions in these antiferromagnetic materials are situated in the hexagonal planes close to critical positions. We have thus demonstrated that the fluctuations of the intermediate ions near critical positions due to mechanical strain cause dramatic changes to the magnetic parameters and allow the magnetic properties to be modified by mechanical strain. To be sure, an abundant class of new 2D materials transition-metal-based double hydroxides, whose properties are similar to those of molybdenum-based chalcogenides have promise as materials to be used in straintronics.

Title: Anisotropic conductivity for the type-I and type-II phases of Weyl/multi-Weyl semimetals in planar Hall set-ups
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We compute the non-Drude part of the conductivity tensor in planar Hall set-ups, for tilted Weyl and multi-Weyl semimetals, considering both the type-I and type-II phases. We do so in three distinct set-ups, taking into account the possible relative orientations of the plane spanned by the electric and magnetic fields ($\mathbf E $ and $\mathbf B $) and the direction of the tilt-axis. We derive the analytical expressions for the response tensor, including the effects of the Berry curvature (BC) and the orbital magnetic moment (OMM), both of which arise due to a nontrivial topology of the three-dimensional manifold defined by the Brillouin zone. We exhibit the interplay of the BC-only and the OMM-dependent parts in the nonzero components of the magnetoelectric conductivity, and outline whether the contributions from the former or the latter dominate the overall response. Our results also show that, depending on the configuration of the planar Hall set-up, one may or may not get terms which have a linear-in-$ B$ dependence.

Abstract: We consider the process of precipitation in binary alloys in the presence of mechanical deformation. It is commonly observed that mechanical deformation prior to or during precipitation leads to microstructure with excess defects, which allows for enhanced precipitate nucleation and growth rates \cite{Weiss1979,Okaguchi1992,Deschamps2003}. To investigate this phenomenon, we employ a two-dimensional phase-field crystal alloy model endowed with a temperature dependent mobility, making it capable of recovering isothermal transformation (TTT) diagrams with a characteristic inflection point (nose) about a critical temperature. We examine the variation in the time-scale of precipitation and its connection to the time-scale of the applied deformation, focusing on the roles of atomic defects in the processes involved. Our results indicate that precipitation is initially delayed through application of a deformation until a critical strain is achieved, beyond which precipitation proceeds more rapidly, assisted by plastic deformation such as grain boundary serration or dislocation nucleation. We show that the evolution of the precipitated fraction, $f(t)$, departs from classical Avrami behaviour. Specifically, $df/dt$ develops two peaks indicative of a ``plateau"-like inflection in $f(t)$, signalling the transition to defect assisted precipitate nucleation. We analyze these plateaus as a function of the deformation rate and demonstrate that the they exhibit a discontinuous bifurcation as the time-scale of applied deformation is increased. These findings are compared to and found to be consistent with experiments.

Title: Exact full-RSB SAT/UNSAT transition in infinitely wide two-layer neural networks
Authors: Brandon L. Annesi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: We analyze the problem of storing random pattern-label associations using two classes of continuous non-convex weights models, namely the perceptron with negative margin and an infinite-width two-layer neural network with non-overlapping receptive fields and generic activation function. Using a full-RSB ansatz we compute the exact value of the SAT/UNSAT transition. Furthermore, in the case of the negative perceptron we show that the overlap distribution of typical states displays an overlap gap (a disconnected support) in certain regions of the phase diagram defined by the value of the margin and the density of patterns to be stored. This implies that some recent theorems that ensure convergence of Approximate Message Passing (AMP) based algorithms to capacity are not applicable. Finally, we show that Gradient Descent is not able to reach the maximal capacity, irrespectively of the presence of an overlap gap for typical states. This finding, similarly to what occurs in binary weight models, suggests that gradient-based algorithms are biased towards highly atypical states, whose inaccessibility determines the algorithmic threshold.

Title: Higher-Order Van Hove Singularities in Kagome Topological Bands
Authors: Edrick Wang, Lakshmi Pullasseri, Luiz H. Santos
Abstract: Motivated by the growing interest in band structures featuring higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS), we investigate a spinless fermion kagome system characterized by nearest-neighbor (NN) and next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) hopping amplitudes. While NN hopping preserves time-reversal symmetry, NNN hopping, akin to chiral hopping on the Haldane lattice, breaks time-reversal symmetry and leads to the formation of topological bands with Chern numbers ranging from $C = \pm 1$ to $ \pm 4$. We perform analytical and numerical analysis of the energy bands near the high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{\Gamma}$, $\pm \boldsymbol{K}$, and $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,$ and $3$), which uncover a rich and complex landscape of HOVHS, controlled by the magnitude and phase of the NNN hopping. We observe power-law divergences in the density of states (DOS), $\rho(\epsilon) \sim |\epsilon|^{-\nu}$, with exponents $\nu = 1/2, 1/3, 1/4$, which can significantly affect the anomalous Hall response at low temperatures when the Fermi level crosses the HOVHS. Additionally, the NNN hopping induces the formation of higher Chern number bands $C = \pm 2, \pm 4$ in the middle of the spectrum obeying a sublattice interference whereupon electronic states are maximally localized in each of the sublattices when the momentum approaches the three high-symmetry points $\boldsymbol{M_i}$ ($i=1,2,$ and $3$) on the Brillouin zone boundary. This classification of HOVHS in kagome systems provides a platform to explore unconventional electronic orders induced by electronic correlations.

Title: Thermodynamic Evidence for Density Wave Order in Two Dimensional 4He Supersolid
Authors: J. Knapp, J.Nyeki, H. Patel, F Ziouzia, B.P.Cowan, J.Saunders
Abstract: We previously reported the discovery of a two dimensional $^{4}$He supersolid; a state with intertwined density wave and superfluid order, observed in the second layer of $^{4}$He adsorbed on graphite. In this Letter we provide direct evidence for the density wave order, obtained by doping the layer with a small concentration of $^{3}$He atoms (impuritons). The heat capacity, magnetization and NMR relaxation times of the $^{3}$He were measured over a wide temperature range from 200 $\mu$K to 500 mK. They provide evidence for changes in the ground state in the second layer film as the amount of $^{4}$He is increased at various fixed $^{3}$He doses. Clear evidence is obtained for a solid second layer film, matching the r\a'egime of superfluid response previously observed in pure $^{4}$He films.

Title: Measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: In this article, we focus on the measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in the systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases. In the former case, it shows a smooth evolution from non-Gaussian (Poission or binomial distribution) with local dephasing to Gaussian with global dephasing (quantum to classical) where in late time there is a global symmetry consist of exponentially many pure states due to the suppressed (stochastic) fluctuation and heating; In the latter case, it shows exponentially many distinct (Krylov) sectors due to the fragmentation and dynamical constrain on Hilbert-space.

Title: Deep Learning Accelerated Quantum Transport Simulations in Nanoelectronics: From Break Junctions to Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: Jijie Zou, Zhanghao Zhouyin, Dongying Lin, Linfeng Zhang, Shimin Hou, Qiangqiang Gu
Abstract: Quantum transport calculations are essential for understanding and designing nanoelectronic devices, yet the trade-off between accuracy and computational efficiency has long limited their practical applications. We present a general framework that combines the deep learning tight-binding Hamiltonian (DeePTB) approach with the non-equilibrium Green's Function (NEGF) method, enabling efficient quantum transport calculations while maintaining first-principles accuracy. We demonstrate the capabilities of the DeePTB-NEGF framework through two representative applications: comprehensive simulation of break junction systems, where conductance histograms show good agreement with experimental measurements in both metallic contact and single-molecule junction cases; and simulation of carbon nanotube field effect transistors through self-consistent NEGF-Poisson calculations, capturing essential physics including the electrostatic potential and transfer characteristic curves under finite bias conditions. This framework bridges the gap between first-principles accuracy and computational efficiency, providing a powerful tool for high-throughput quantum transport simulations across different scales in nanoelectronics.

Title: Third-order and fifth-order nonlinear spin-current generation in $g$-wave and $i$-wave altermagnets, and perfectly nonreciprocal spin-current in $f$-wave magnets
Authors: Motohiko Ezawa
Abstract: A prominent feature of $d$-wave altermagnets is the pure spin current generated in the absence of spin-orbit interactions. In the context of symmetry, there are the $s$-wave, the $p$-wave, the $d$-wave, the $f$-wave, the $g$-wave and the $i$-wave magnets. In this paper, making an analytic study of two-band Hamiltonian systems coupled with electrons, we demonstrate unexpectedly that only the $\ell $-th order nonlinear transverse spin current proportional to $E^{\ell }$ is generated in higher-wave symmetric magnets when the number of the nodes is $\ell +1$. Here $E$ is applied electric field. The nonlinear spin current is essential provided the linear spin current is absent. Indeed, only the third-order nonlinear spin current is generated in $g$-wave altermagnets, while only the fifth-order spin current is generated in $i$-wave altermagnets. In particular, only the second-order nonlinear spin current is generated in $f$-wave magnets, which leads to a perfect nonreciprocal spin current. On the other hand, there is no spin-current generation in $p$-wave magnets.

Title: Simplified derivations for high-dimensional convex learning problems
Authors: David G. Clark, Haim Sompolinsky
Abstract: Statistical-physics calculations in machine learning and theoretical neuroscience often involve lengthy derivations that obscure physical interpretation. We present concise, non-replica derivations of key results and highlight their underlying similarities. Using a cavity approach, we analyze high-dimensional learning problems: perceptron classification of points and manifolds, and kernel ridge regression. These problems share a common structure--a bipartite system of interacting feature and datum variables--enabling a unified analysis. For perceptron-capacity problems, we identify a symmetry that allows derivation of correct capacities through a naïve method.

Title: Corrugation-dominated mechanical softening of defect-engineered graphene
Authors: Wael Joudi, Rika Saskia Windisch, Alberto Trentino, Diana Propst, Jacob Madsen, Toma Susi, Clemens Mangler, Kimmo Mustonen, Florian Libisch, Jani Kotakoski
Abstract: We measure the two-dimensional elastic modulus $E^\text{2D}$ of atomically clean defect-engineered graphene with a known defect distribution and density in correlated ultra-high vacuum experiments. The vacancies are introduced via low-energy (< 200 eV) Ar ion irradiation and the atomic structure is obtained via semi-autonomous scanning transmission electron microscopy and image analysis. Based on atomic force microscopy nanoindentation measurements, a decrease of $E^\text{2D}$ from 286 to 158 N/m is observed when measuring the same graphene membrane before and after an ion irradiation-induced vacancy density of $1.0\times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. This decrease is significantly greater than what is predicted by most theoretical studies and in stark contrast to some measurements presented in the literature. With the assistance of atomistic simulations, we show that this softening is mostly due to corrugations caused by local strain at vacancies with two or more missing atoms, while the influence of single vacancies is negligible. We further demonstrate that the opposite effect can be measured when surface contamination is not removed before defect engineering

Title: Thermomagnetic anomalies in quantum magnon transport caused by tunable junction geometries in cold atomic systems
Authors: Yuta Sekino, Yuya Ominato, Hiroyuki Tajima, Shun Uchino, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: We study magnon-driven spin and heat transport in a magnetic linear junction (MLJ) formed by two ferromagnets in optical lattices linked via linearly aligned bonds. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we uncover that under weak effective Zeeman fields, where Bose-Einstein statistics of magnons dominate, magnonic criticality dramatically enhances spin and thermal conductances. These singular transport properties depend on the junction geometry, and the transport properties qualitatively differ between the linear junction in this study and the point contact in our previous work. The quantum-enhanced conductances result in the breakdown of the magnonic Wiedemann-Franz (WF) law. In the classical regime at temperatures much lower than magnon energy gaps, we find that a magnonic Lorenz number becomes independent of temperature yet dependent on junction geometry, sharply contrasting with the universal WF law for Fermi liquids. We also find that the interface geometry of MLJ decouples spin and heat relaxations between ferromagnets with decay times insensitive to temperature and effective Zeeman fields. These dynamics reveal junction-geometry-sensitive magnon transport distinct from Fermi liquids, paving the way for new avenues in thermomagnetic research leveraging the tunability of cold atomic systems.

Title: Fractonic superfluids. III. Hybridizing higher moments
Authors: Han-Xie Wang, Shuai A. Chen, Peng Ye
Abstract: Fractonic superfluids are featured by the interplay of spontaneously broken charge symmetry and mobility constraints on single-particle kinematics due to the conservation of higher moments, such as dipoles, angular charge moments, and quadrupoles. Building on prior studies by Yuan et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 2, 023267 (2020)] and Chen et al. [Phys. Rev. Res. 3, 013226 (2021)], we study a class of fractonic superfluids, termed \textit{hybrid fractonic superfluids} (HFS), in which bosons of multiple species interact while moment hybridization is conserved. We explore the consequences of hybridization via two model series: \textit{Model Series A}, conserving total moments of the same order across species, and \textit{Model Series B}, conserving total moments of different orders. In Model Series A, we analyze dipole moment hybridization and extend the discussion to higher-order moments, examining the ground state, Goldstone modes, correlation functions, and so on. We compute the minimal spatial dimensions, where the total charge symmetry begins to get partially broken via particle-hole condensation, leading to true off-diagonal long-range order. In Model Series B, we focus on HFS with hybrid dipole-quadrupole conservation. For both series, we introduce Bose-Hubbard-type lattice models that reduce to either of both series in the weak Hubbard interaction regime. We perform a mean-field analysis on the global phase diagram and discuss experimental realizations in strongly tilted optical lattices via a third-order perturbation theory. This work, alongside prior studies, completes a trilogy on fractonic superfluids, uncovering symmetry-breaking physics emerging from higher moment conservation, leaving various promising studies for future investigation.

Title: On the importance of Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion in the formation of a Ni-Au / p-GaN ohmic contact
Authors: Jules Duraz, Hassen Souissi, Maksym Gromovyi, David Troadec, Teo Baptiste, Nathaniel Findling, Phuong Vuong, Rajat Gujrati, Thi May Tran, Jean Paul Salvestrini, Maria Tchernycheva, Suresh Sundaram, Abdallah Ougazzaden, Gilles Patriarche, Sophie Bouchoule
Abstract: The Ni-Au-Ga interdiffusion mechanisms taking place during rapid thermal annealing (RTA) under oxygen atmosphere of a Ni-Au/p-GaN contact are investigated by high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HR-TEM) coupled to energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX). It is shown that oxygen-assisted, Ni diffusion to the top surface of the metallic contact through the formation of a nickel oxide (NiOx) is accompanied by Au diffusion down to the GaN surface, and by Ga out-diffusion through the GaN/metal interface. Electrical characterizations of the contact by Transmission Line Method (TLM) show that an ohmic contact is obtained as soon as a thin, Au-Ga interfacial layer is formed, even after complete diffusion of Ni or NiOx to the top surface of the contact. Our results clarify that the presence of Ni or NiOx at the interface is not the main origin of the ohmic-like behavior in such contacts. Auto-cleaning of the interface during the interdiffusion process may play a role, but TEM-EDX analysis evidences that the creation of Ga vacancies associated to the formation of a Ga-Au interfacial layer is crucial for reducing the Schottky barrier height, and maximizing the amount of current flowing through the contact.

Title: Molecular tuning of excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals
Authors: Tomojit Chowdhury, Aurélie Champagne, Patrick Knüppel, Zehra Naqvi, Mengyu Gao, Nathan Guisinger, Kin Fai Mak, Jeffrey B. Neaton, Jiwoong Park
Abstract: Bilayer crystals, formed by stacking monolayers of two-dimensional (2D) crystals, create interlayer potentials that govern excitonic phenomena but are constrained by their fixed covalent lattices. Replacing one layer with an atomically thin molecular crystal overcomes this limitation, as precise control of functional groups enables tunable 2D molecular lattices and, consequently, electronic structures. Here, we report molecular tuning of lattices and excitons in four-atom-thick hybrid bilayer crystals (HBCs), synthesized as monolayers of perylene-based molecular and transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) single crystals. In HBCs, we observe an anisotropic photoluminescence signal exhibiting characteristics of both molecular and TMD excitons, directly tuned by molecular geometry and HBC composition. Ab initio calculations reveal that this anisotropic emission arises from hybrid excitons, which inherit properties from both layers through a hybridized bilayer band structure. Our work establishes a synthetically derived, molecule-based 2D quantum materials platform with the potential for engineering interlayer potentials.

Title: Native antisite defects in h-BN
Authors: Song Li, Pei Li, Adam Gali
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) is an excellent host for solid-state single phonon emitters. Experimental observed emission ranges from infrared to ultraviolet. The emission centers are generally attributed to either intrinsic or extrinsic point defects embedded into hBN. Nevertheless, the microscopic structure of most of these defect emitters is uncertain. Here, through density-functional theory calculations we studied the native antisite defects in hBN. We find that the neutral boron antisite might be a nonmagnetic single photon source with zero-phonon-line (ZPL) at 1.58 eV and such a lineshape that is often observed in experiments. Furthermore, the positively charged nitrogen antisite might be associated with a dim color center recently observed as a blue emitter with ZPL at 2.63 eV. These simple single substitution defects indicate the existence of out-of-plane phonon mode which significantly affects the optical properties. Our results could provide useful information for identification of quantum emitters in hBN.

Title: Discovery of Spin-Crossover Candidates with Equivariant Graph Neural Networks and Relevance-Based Classification
Authors: Angel Albavera-Mata, Pawan Prakash, Jason B. Gibson, Eric Fonseca, Sijin Ren, Xiao-Guang Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng, Michael Shatruk, S.B. Trickey, Richard G. Hennig
Abstract: Swift discovery of spin-crossover materials for their potential application in quantum information devices requires techniques which enable efficient identification of suitably bistable candidates. To this end, we screened the Cambridge Structural Database to develop a specialized database of 1,439 materials and computed spin-switching energies from density functional theory for each material. The database was used to train an equivariant graph convolutional neural network to predict the magnitude of the spin-conversion energy. A test mean absolute error was 360 meV. For candidate identification, we equipped the system with a relevance-based classifier. This approach leads to a nearly four-fold improvement in identifying potential spin-crossover systems of interest as compared to conventional high-throughput screening.

Title: Inferring High-Order Couplings with Neural Networks
Authors: Aurélien Decelle, Alfonso de Jesús Navas Gómez, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Maximum entropy methods, based on the inverse Ising/Potts problem from statistical mechanics, are essential for modeling interactions between pairs of variables in data-driven problems across disciplines such as bioinformatics, ecology, and neuroscience. Despite their considerable success, these methods typically fail to capture higher-order interactions that are often essential for understanding complex systems. Conversely, modern machine learning methods capture these complex interactions, but the computational cost of interpretable frameworks makes them impractical for real-world applications. Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a computationally efficient way to capture statistical correlations using hidden nodes in a bipartite neural network. In this study, we introduce a new method that maps RBMs to generalized Potts models, allowing for the extraction of interactions up to any specified order. This method utilizes large-$N$ approximations, enabled by the RBM's simple structure, to extract effective many-body couplings with minimal computational effort. Furthermore, we propose a robust framework for extracting higher-order interactions in more complex probabilistic models and a simple gauge-fixing method within the effective many-body Potts model. Our validation on synthetic datasets confirms the method's ability to recover two- and three-body interactions accurately. When applied to protein sequence data, the framework competently reconstructs protein contact maps and provides performance comparable to the best inverse Potts models. These findings confirm that RBMs are an effective and streamlined tool for exploring higher-order interactions within complex systems.

Title: Feedback cooling of fermionic atoms in optical lattices
Authors: Wenhua Zhao, Ling-Na Wu, Francesco Petiziol, André Eckardt
Abstract: We discuss the preparation of topological insulator states with fermionic ultracold atoms in optical lattices by means of measurement-based Markovian feedback control. The designed measurement and feedback operators induce an effective dissipative channel that stabilizes the desired insulator state, either in an exact way or approximately in the case where additional experimental constraints are assumed. Successful state preparation is demonstrated in one-dimensional insulators as well as for Haldane's Chern insulator, by calculating the fidelity between the target ground state and the steady state of the feedback-modified master equation. The fidelity is obtained via time evolution of the system with moderate sizes. For larger 2D systems, we compare the mean occupation of the single-particle eigenstates for the ground and steady state computed through mean-field kinetic equations.

Title: Soil creep facilitated by cyclic variations of environmental conditions
Authors: Ezequiel E. Ferrero, Eduardo A. Jagla
Abstract: Sloped terrains tend to creep downward over time, even when their slope is below the nominal angle of repose. This behavior can result from periodic variations in environmental conditions, such as daily or seasonal fluctuations in temperature and humidity. We study this process by considering a model of an athermal yield stress material under an applied stress lower than the critical yield stress value $\sigma_c$. Normally, in such a situation the material does not flow at all. However, under cyclic temporal variation of system parameters a finite amount of irreversible deformation can remain after each cycle, and a long term steady-state flow of the whole system can be induced. In our model, we cycle the strength of internal elastic interactions to mimic the effect of cyclic variation of environmental conditions in the real soils. We find that the amount of deformation per cycle increases if $\sigma_c$ is approached from below, and it decreases and even vanishes at a novel critical stress $\sigma_0<\sigma_c$ when this, in turn, is reached from above. Interestingly, $\sigma_0$ plays a role similar to the endurance limit in the context of fatigue damage propagation. Despite the model's simplicity, our results offer a fresh perspective on subcritical landform evolution, with implications for the creep of hill slopes over long periods and the precursors to runaway landslides.

Title: Self-aligned multilayered nitrogen vacancy diamond nanoparticles for high spatial resolution magnetometry of microelectronic currents

Abstract: Nitrogen Vacancy diamond nanoparticles (NVNPs) are increasingly integrated with methods for optical detection of magnetic resonance (ODMR), providing new opportunities in magnetic characterization that span the visualization of magnetic fields in microelectronic circuits, environmental sensing and biology. However, only a small number of studies utilize aggregates of NVNPs for surface-wide magnetometry being that spin orientations in aggregate NVNPs are inherently misaligned, precluding their use for proper magnetic field detection compared with expensive monocrystalline diamonds. A postprocessing method for layering NVNPs with aligned NV center orientations can potentially facilitate superior NV magnetometry by allowing sensitive detection combined with simplified probe preparation. We present a novel technology for creating densely stacked monolayers of NVNP with inherent interlayer alignment for sensitive measurement of local magnetic field perturbations in microelectronic traces. We establish spatial characteristics of deposited aggregates and demonstrate their ability to capture magnetic dipoles from conducting microwires via ODMR. Our approach forms a novel accessible protocol that can be used for broad applications in micromagnetometry.

Title: Director-layer dynamics in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of a ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal
Authors: Arjun Ghimire, Bijaya Basnet, Hao Wang, Parikshit Guragain, Alan Baldwin, Robert Twieg, Oleg Lavrentovich, James Gleeson, Antal Jakli, Samuel Sprunt
Abstract: A dynamic light scattering study of director-layer fluctuations in the antiferroelectric smectic-ZA phase of the ferroelectric nematic liquid crystal DIO is reported. The dynamics are consistent with the distinctive feature of the ZA phase that the smectic layers form parallel to the axis of molecular orientational order (director). A model is developed to describe quantitatively the dispersion of the fluctuation relaxation rates. The model is based on a specialization of the elastic free energy density of the smectic-C phase to the case of 90 degree director tilt, a "first-order" approximation of the viscous stresses by their form for an incompressible uniaxial fluid, and a treatment of the effect of chevron layer structure that develops in planar sample cells due to temperature-dependent layer shrinkage, as documented in previous studies on DIO. From the modeling, the layer compression elastic constant is estimated to be ~100 times lower in the smectic-ZA phase than in an ordinary smectic-A liquid crystal. Possible effects of the antiferroelectric layer polarization on the director splay elasticity and viscosity are described. The temperature dependencies of the splay, twist, and bend elastic constants and associated viscosities in the higher temperature nematic phase are also presented.

Title: Topological Signatures of the Optical Bound on Maximal Berry Curvature: Applications to Two-Dimensional Time-Reversal-Symmetric Insulators
Authors: Pok Man Chiu
Abstract: Unlike broken time-reversal symmetric (TRS) systems with a defined Chern number, directly measuring the bulk $Z_{2}$ invariant and Berry curvature (if nonzero) in topological insulators and their higher-order topological families remains an unsolved problem. Here, based on the refined trace-determinant inequality (TDI) involving the trace and determinant of the quantum metric and maximal Berry curvature (MBC), we establish an optical bound on the MBC for two-dimensional TRS insulators. By utilizing experimental data on linearly polarized optical conductivity within a certain energy range, the topological signatures can be identified by integrating the optical bound. We illustrate our approach using three representative topological models: the Kane-Mele model, mirror-protected insulator, and quadrupole insulator. We find that the resulting momentum integration of the refined TDI provides an intrinsic relationship between quantum volume (QV) variations and topological phase transitions. We argue that double QV can be treated as an upper bound on the number of boundary states. Our findings offer a method for extracting the topological signatures of TRS insulators using optical conductivity data.

Title: Simulation of the thermocapillary assembly of a colloidal cluster during the evaporation of a liquid film in an unevenly heated cell
Authors: Kristina N. Kondrashova, Konstantin S. Kolegov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: The control of the thermocapillary assembly of colloidal particle clusters is important for a variety of applications, including the creation of photonic crystals for microelectronics and optoelectronics, membrane formation for biotechnology, and surface cleaning for laboratory-on-chip devices. It is important to understand the main mechanisms that influence the formation of such clusters. This article considers a two-dimensional mathematical model describing the transfer of particles by a thermocapillary flow in an unevenly heated cell during the evaporation of a liquid. This gave us the opportunity to study one of the main processes that triggers the formation of a particle cluster. Whether the particle will move with the flow or stop at the heater, becoming the basis for the cluster, is determined by the ratio between gravity and the drag force. The results of numerical calculations show that, for small particle concentrations, their fraction entering the cluster decreases as the volumetric heat flux density $Q$ increases. The reason for this is an increase in the thermocapillary flow with an increase in the volumetric heat flux $Q$. It reduces the probability of particles entering the cluster.

Title: Beyond the Bethe-Salpeter equation in DFT based computational spectroscopy
Authors: Alessandro Mirone, Mauro Rovezzi, Christoph Sahle, Alessandro Longo
Abstract: We introduce a theoretical framework that accurately describes resonances beyond the reach of both multiplet-based and density-functional-theory (DFT)-based codes. When a resonance acquires strong continuum character, multiplet approaches struggle with the exponential growth of the Hilbert space driven by the increasing number of relevant orbitals, if they extend beyond a few atomic and ligand orbitals. Conversely, existing \emph{ab initio} codes, supplemented by diagrammatic techniques, remain largely confined to the Bethe--Salpeter equation, which tracks only two-particle excitations. However, many systems of interest, particularly those containing open $d$ or $f$ shells, require the propagation of an $N$-particle system, yielding a richer spectral landscape dominated by significant continuum effects. Here, we propose a theoretical framework, together with its numerical implementation, that bridges this gap and enables the rigorous exploration of such resonances.

Title: Energy dynamics in a class of local random matrix Hamiltonians
Authors: Klée Pollock, Jonathan D. Kroth, Nathan Pagliaroli, Thomas Iadecola, Jonathon Riddell
Abstract: Random matrix theory yields valuable insights into the universal features of quantum many-body chaotic systems. Although all-to-all interactions are traditionally studied, many interesting dynamical questions, such as transport of a conserved density, require a notion of spatially local interactions. We study the transport of the energy, the most basic conserved density, in few-body and 1D chains of nearest-neighbor random matrix terms that square to one. In the few-body but large local Hilbert space dimension case, we develop a mapping for the energy dynamics to a single-particle hopping picture. This allows for the computation of the energy density autocorrelators and an out-of-time-ordered correlator of the energy density. In the 1D chain, we numerically study the energy transport for a small local Hilbert space dimension. We also discuss the density of states throughout and touch upon the relation to free probability theory.

Title: Phase diagram of solution of oppositely charged polyelectrolytes
Authors: Rui Zhang, B. I. Shklovskii
Abstract: We study a solution of long polyanions (PA) with shorter polycations (PC) and focus on the role of Coulomb interaction. A good example is solutions of DNA and PC which are widely studied for gene therapy. In the solution, each PA attracts many PCs to form a complex. When the ratio of total charges of PA and PC in the solution, $x$, equals to 1, complexes are neutral and they condense in a macroscopic drop. When $x$ is far away from 1, complexes are strongly charged. The Coulomb repulsion is large and free complexes are stable. As $x$ approaches to 1, PCs attached to PA disproportionate themselves in two competing ways. One way is inter-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make some complexes neutral and therefore condensed in a macroscopic drop while other complexes become even stronger charged and stay free. The other way is intra-complex disproportionation, in which PCs make one end of a complex neutral and condensed in a small droplet while the rest of the complex forms a strongly charged tail. Thus each complex becomes a "tadpole". These two ways can also combine together to give even lower free energy. We get a phase diagram of PA-PC solution in a plane of $x$ and inverse screening radius of the monovalent salt, which includes phases or phase coexistence with both kinds of disproportionation.

Title: Probing spectral features of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators
Authors: Jinzhao Sun, Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Vlatko Vedral, Andrew T. Boothroyd, M. S. Kim
Abstract: The efficient probing of spectral features is important for characterising and understanding the structure and dynamics of quantum materials. In this work, we establish a framework for probing the excitation spectrum of quantum many-body systems with quantum simulators. Our approach effectively realises a spectral detector by processing the dynamics of observables with time intervals drawn from a defined probability distribution, which only requires native time evolution governed by the Hamiltonian without ancilla. The critical element of our method is the engineered emergence of frequency resonance such that the excitation spectrum can be probed. We show that the time complexity for transition energy estimation has a logarithmic dependence on simulation accuracy and how such observation can be guaranteed in certain many-body systems. We discuss the noise robustness of our spectroscopic method and show that the total running time maintains polynomial dependence on accuracy in the presence of device noise. We further numerically test the error dependence and the scalability of our method for lattice models. We present simulation results for the spectral features of typical quantum systems, either gapped or gapless, including quantum spins, fermions and bosons. We demonstrate how excitation spectra of spin-lattice models can be probed experimentally with IBM quantum devices.

Title: Chiral perturbation theory and Bose-Einstein condensation in QCD
Authors: Jens O. Andersen, Martin Kjøllesdal Johnsrud, Qing Yu, Hua Zhou
Abstract: We present recent results in three-flavor chiral perturbation theory at finite isospin $\mu_I$ and strangeness $\mu_s$ chemical potentials at zero temperature. The phase diagram to ${\cal O}(p^2)$ in the $\mu_I$--$\mu_S$ plane is mapped out with and without electromagnetic effects. The phase diagram consists of a vacuum phase and three Bose-condensed phases with condensates of $\pi^{\pm}$, $K^{\pm}$, and $K^{0}/\bar{K}^0$, respectively. Including electromagnetic interactions, the Bose-condensed phases become Higgs phases via the Higgs mechanism. The tree-level spectrum for the mesons and gauge bosons is also derived. We calculate the pressure, energy density, isospin density, and speed of sound in the pion-condensed phase to ${\cal O}(p^4)$ for three-flavor $\chi$PT. The results are compared with recent lattice simulations and the agreement is very good for isospin chemical potentials up to approximately 200 MeV. Moreover, by integrating out the $s$-quark, we show that the thermodynamic quantities can be mapped onto their two-flavor counterparts with renormalized parameters. %to ${\cal O}(p^6)$ for two-flavor $\chi$PT in the chiral limit. We also consider the nonrelativistic limit. It is shown that the energy density can be matched onto the classic result by Lee, Huang and Yang (LHY) for a dilute Bose, with an $s$-wave scattering length that includes radiative corrections. The breaking of the $U(1)$ symmetry in the Bose-condensed phases gives rise to a Goldstone bosons, whose dispersion is linear for momenta $p\ll\mu_I$. In this regime, we use Son's prescription to construct an effective theory for the Goldstone field which is valid in this regime. It is shown that its damping rate is of order $p^5$. This result is in agreement with Beliav's for a dilute Bose gas.

Title: Quantum circuits with free fermions in disguise
Authors: Balázs Pozsgay, Kohei Fukai
Abstract: Recently multiple families of spin chain models were found, which have a free fermionic spectrum,even though they are not solvable by a Jordan-Wigner transformation. Instead, the free fermions emerge as a result of a rather intricate construction. In this work we consider the quantum circuit formulation of the problem. We construct circuits using local unitary gates built from the terms in the local Hamiltonians of the respective models, and ask the question: which circuit geometries (sequence of gates) lead to a free fermionic spectrum? Our main example is the 4-fermion model of Fendley, where we construct free fermionic circuits with various geometries. In certain cases we prove the free fermionic nature, while for other geometries we confirm it numerically. Surprisingly, we find that many standard brickwork circuits are not free fermionic, but we identify certain symmetric constructions which are. We also consider a recent generalization of the 4-fermion model and obtain the factorization of its transfer matrix, and subsequently derive a free-fermionic circuit for this case as well.

Title: Efficient Quantum Cooling Algorithm for Fermionic Systems
Authors: Lucas Marti, Refik Mansuroglu, Michael J. Hartmann
Abstract: We present a cooling algorithm for ground state preparation of fermionic Hamiltonians. Our algorithm makes use of the Hamiltonian simulation of the considered system coupled to an ancillary fridge, which is regularly reset to its known ground state. We derive suitable interaction Hamiltonians that originate from ladder operators of the free theory and initiate resonant gaps between system and fridge. We further propose a spectroscopic scan to find the relevant eigenenergies of the system using energy measurements on the fridge. With these insights, we design a ground state cooling algorithm for fermionic systems that is efficient, i.e. its runtime is polynomial in the system size, as long as the initial state is prepared in a low-energy sector of polynomial size. We achieve the latter via a pseudo-adiabatic sweep from a parameter regime whose ground state can be easily prepared. We estimate that our algorithm has a polynomial runtime for systems where the spectral gap decreases at most polynomially in system size, and is faster than the adiabatic algorithm for a large range of settings. We generalize the algorithm to prepare thermal states and demonstrate our findings on the Fermi-Hubbard model.

Title: KAN: Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
Authors: Ziming Liu, Yixuan Wang, Sachin Vaidya, Fabian Ruehle, James Halverson, Marin Soljačić, Thomas Y. Hou, Max Tegmark
Abstract: Inspired by the Kolmogorov-Arnold representation theorem, we propose Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) as promising alternatives to Multi-Layer Perceptrons (MLPs). While MLPs have fixed activation functions on nodes ("neurons"), KANs have learnable activation functions on edges ("weights"). KANs have no linear weights at all -- every weight parameter is replaced by a univariate function parametrized as a spline. We show that this seemingly simple change makes KANs outperform MLPs in terms of accuracy and interpretability. For accuracy, much smaller KANs can achieve comparable or better accuracy than much larger MLPs in data fitting and PDE solving. Theoretically and empirically, KANs possess faster neural scaling laws than MLPs. For interpretability, KANs can be intuitively visualized and can easily interact with human users. Through two examples in mathematics and physics, KANs are shown to be useful collaborators helping scientists (re)discover mathematical and physical laws. In summary, KANs are promising alternatives for MLPs, opening opportunities for further improving today's deep learning models which rely heavily on MLPs.

Title: The atomizing pulsed jet
Authors: Yash Kulkarni, Cesar Pairetti, Raphaël Villiers, Stéphane Popinet, Stéphane Zaleski
Abstract: Direct Numerical Simulations of the injection of a pulsed round liquid jet in a stagnant gas are performed in a series of runs of geometrically progressing resolution. The Reynolds and Weber numbers and the density ratio are sufficiently large for reaching a complex high-speed atomization regime but not so large so that the small length scales of the flow are impossible to resolve, except for very small liquid-sheet thickness. The Weber number based on grid size is then small, an indication that the simulations are very well resolved. Computations are performed using octree adaptive mesh refinement with a finite volume method and height-function computation of curvature, down to a specified minimum grid size $\Delta$. Qualitative analysis of the flow and its topology reveals a complex structure of ligaments, sheets, droplets and bubbles that evolve and interact through impacts, ligament breakup, sheet rupture and engulfment of air bubbles in the liquid. A rich gallery of images of entangled structures is produced. Most processes occurring in this type of atomization are reproduced in detail, except at the instant of thin sheet perforation or breakup. We analyze droplet statistics, showing that as the grid resolution is increased, the small-scale part of the distribution does not converge, and contains a large number of droplets close in order of magnitude to the minimum grid size with a significant peak at $d = 3\Delta$. This non-convergence arises from the numerical sheet breakup effect, in which the interface becomes rough just before it breaks. The rough appearance of the interface is associated to a high-wavenumber oscillation of the curvature. To recover convergence, we apply the controlled "manifold death" numerical procedure, in which thin sheets are detected, and then pierced by fiat before they reach a set critical thickness $h_c$.

Title: Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT
Authors: Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits, which achieve the optimal rate, i.e., the quantum capacity. The decoders are constructed by extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise, using the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT). By developing a proof technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the construction, we rigorously show that the proposed decoders are applicable to any noise model and successfully recover quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied. This implies that the proposed decoders can be used to achieve the quantum capacity. Our constructions have advantages also in terms of the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previously known explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.

Title: Noise-resilient and resource-efficient hybrid algorithm for robust quantum gap estimation
Authors: Woo-Ram Lee, Nathan M. Myers, V. W. Scarola
Abstract: We present a hybrid quantum algorithm for estimating gaps in many-body energy spectra, supported by an analytic proof of its inherent resilience to state preparation and measurement errors, as well as mid-circuit multi-qubit depolarizing noise. Our analysis extends to a broader class of Markovian noise, employing error mitigation strategies that optimize the utilization of quantum resources. By integrating trial-state optimization and classical signal processing into the algorithm, we amplify the signal peak corresponding to the exact target gap beyond the error threshold, thereby significantly reducing gap estimate errors. The algorithm's robustness is demonstrated through noisy simulations on the Qiskit Aer simulator and demonstrations on IBM Quantum processors. These results underscore the potential to enable accurate quantum simulations on near-term noisy quantum devices without resource-intensive error correction.

Title: Cascade of phase transitions in the training of Energy-based models
Authors: Dimitrios Bachtis, Giulio Biroli, Aurélien Decelle, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the feature encoding process in a prototypical energy-based generative model, the Restricted Boltzmann Machine (RBM). We start with an analytical investigation using simplified architectures and data structures, and end with numerical analysis of real trainings on real datasets. Our study tracks the evolution of the model's weight matrix through its singular value decomposition, revealing a series of phase transitions associated to a progressive learning of the principal modes of the empirical probability distribution. The model first learns the center of mass of the modes and then progressively resolve all modes through a cascade of phase transitions. We first describe this process analytically in a controlled setup that allows us to study analytically the training dynamics. We then validate our theoretical results by training the Bernoulli-Bernoulli RBM on real data sets. By using data sets of increasing dimension, we show that learning indeed leads to sharp phase transitions in the high-dimensional limit. Moreover, we propose and test a mean-field finite-size scaling hypothesis. This shows that the first phase transition is in the same universality class of the one we studied analytically, and which is reminiscent of the mean-field paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic phase transition.

Title: Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory
Authors: Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has been long desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, resolved by higher category theory. The problem is resolved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way. The refinement needed is a generalization -- through the lens of higher category theory -- of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, hence the language of categories becomes natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ (pion vacua) non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory. In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.

Title: Relaxation Fluctuations of Correlation Functions: Spin and Random Matrix Models
Authors: Tanay Pathak
Abstract: Spectral statistics and correlations are the usual way to study the presence or absence of quantum chaos in quantum systems. We present our investigation on the study of the fluctuation average and variance of certain correlation functions as a diagnostic measure of quantum chaos and to possibly characterize quantum systems based on it. These quantities are related to eigenvector distribution and eigenvector correlation. Using the Random Matrix Theory certain analytical expressions of these quantities, for the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble case, were calculated before. So as a first step, we study these quantities for the Gaussian unitary ensemble case numerically, and deduce certain analytical results for the same. We then carry out our investigations in physical system, such as the mixed-field Ising model. For this model, we find that although the eigenvalue statistics follow the behaviour of corresponding random matrices, the fluctuation average and variance of these correlation functions deviate from the expected random matrix theory behaviour. We then turn our focus on the Rosenzweig-Porter model of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble and Gaussian Unitary Ensemble types. By using the fluctuation average and variance of these correlations, we identify the three distinct phases of these models: the ergodic, the fractal, and the localized phases. We provide an alternative way to study and distinguish the three phases and firmly establish the use of these correlation fluctuations as an alternative way to characterize quantum chaos.

Title: Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory
Authors: X. Zhang, C. C. Wang, C. R. Ding, J. M. Yao
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.

Title: Nonstabilizerness in U(1) lattice gauge theory
Authors: Pedro R. Nicácio Falcão, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Martina Frau, Emanuele Tirrito, Jakub Zakrzewski, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: We present a thorough investigation of nonstabilizerness - a fundamental quantum resource that quantifies state complexity within the framework of quantum computing - in a one-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. We show how nonstabilizerness is always extensive with volume, and has no direct relation to the presence of critical points. However, its derivatives typically display discontinuities across the latter: This indicates that nonstabilizerness is strongly sensitive to criticality, but in a manner that is very different from entanglement (that, typically, is maximal at the critical point). Our results indicate that error-corrected simulations of lattice gauge theories close to the continuum limit have similar computational costs to those at finite correlation length and provide rigorous lower bounds for quantum resources of such quantum computations.

Title: Energy exchange and fluctuations between a dissipative qubit and a monitor under continuous measurement and feedback
Authors: Tsuyoshi Yamamoto, Yasuhiro Tokura
Abstract: Continuous quantum measurement and feedback induce energy exchange between a dissipative qubit and a monitor even in the steady state, as a measurement backaction. Using the Lindblad equation, we identified the maximum and minimum values of the steady-state energy flow as the measurement and feedback states vary, and we demonstrate the qubit cooling induced by these processes. Turning our attention to quantum trajectories under continuous measurement and feedback, we observe that the energy flow fluctuates around the steady-state values. We reveal that the fluctuations are strongly influenced by the measurement backaction, distinguishing them from the standard Poisson noise typically observed in electronic circuits. Our results offer potential application in the development of quantum refrigerators controlled by continuous measurement and feedback, and provide deep insight into quantum thermodynamics from the perspective of fluctuation.

Title: On force balance in Brinkman fluids under confinement
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: A point force acting on a Brinkman fluid in confinement is always counterbalanced by the force on the porous medium, the force on the walls and the stress at open boundaries. We discuss the distribution of those forces in different geometries: a long pipe, a medium with a single no-slip planar boundary, a porous sphere with an open boundary and a porous sphere with a no-slip wall. We determine the forces using the Lorentz reciprocal theorem and additionally validate the results with explicit analytical flow solutions. We discuss the relevance of our findings for cellular processes such as cytoplasmic streaming and centrosome positioning.

Title: Modular Properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles
Authors: Max Downing, Faisal Karimi
Abstract: We investigate the modular properties of Generalised Gibbs Ensembles (GGEs) in two dimensional conformal field theories. These are obtained by inserting higher spin charges in the expressions for the partition function of the theory. We investigate the particular case where KdV charges are inserted in the GGE. We first determine an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE. This expression is an expansion in terms of the zero modes of all the quasi-primary fields in the theory, not just the KdV charges. While these charges are non-commuting they can be re-exponentiated to give an asymptotic expression for the transformed GGE in terms of another GGE. As an explicit example we focus on the Lee-Yang model. We use the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz in the Lee-Yang model to first replicate the asymptotic results, and then find additional energies that need to be included in the transformed GGE in order to find the exact modular transformation.

Title: Time-dependent radiative heat flux after the beginning of thermal radiation
Authors: Kiryl Asheichyk
Abstract: We develop a theoretical formalism for time-dependent radiative heat flux from one object to another in the case where the former starts radiating at a certain time. The time dependence is demonstrated for the heat flux between two isolated nanoparticles. After one particle starts radiating, the emitted energy first reaches the other one with a delay according to electromagnetic retardation, and afterwards the flux exhibits oscillatory exponential relaxation to its stationary value. For the room- or higher-temperature radiation, the oscillation period and relaxation time are determined by the resonance frequency and damping rate of the particle polarizability, respectively, being equal to dozens of femtoseconds and one picosecond for silicon carbide particles. At cryogenic temperatures, the relaxation time depends on the thermal wavelength.

Title: The large $N$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$
Authors: Justin R. David, Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We develop a method to evaluate the partition function and energy density of a massive scalar on a 2-sphere of radius $r$ and at finite temperature $\beta$ as power series in $\frac{\beta}{r}$. Each term in the power series can be written in terms of polylogarithms. We use this result to obtain the gap equation for the large $N$, critical $O(N)$ model with a quartic interaction on $S^1\times S^2$ in the large radius expansion. Solving the gap equation perturbatively we obtain the leading finite size corrections to the expectation value of stress tensor for the $O(N)$ vector model on $S^1\times S^2$. Applying the Euclidean inversion formula on the perturbative expansion of the thermal two point function we obtain the finite size corrections to the expectation value of the higher spin currents of the critical $O(N)$ model. Finally we show that these finite size corrections of higher spin currents tend to that of the free theory at large spin as seen earlier for the model on $S^1\times R^2$.

Title: Mechanical softening and enhanced elasticity of lunar olivine probed via nanoindentation and high-pressure X-ray diffraction measurements

Abstract: The mechanical properties of minerals in planetary materials are not only interesting from a fundamental point of view but also critical to the development of future space missions. Here we present nanoindentation experiments to evaluate the hardness and reduced elastic modulus of olivine, (Mg, Fe)2SiO4, in meteorite NWA 12008, a lunar basalt. Our experiments suggest that the olivine grains in this lunaite are softer and more elastic than their terrestrial counterparts. Also, we have performed synchrotron-based high-pressure X-ray diffraction (HP-XRD) measurements to probe the compressibility properties of this meteorite and, for comparison purposes, of three ordinary chondrites. The HP-XRD results suggest that the axial compressibility of the orthorhombic $b$ lattice parameter of olivine relative to terrestrial olivine is higher in NWA 12008 and also in the highly-shocked Chelyabinsk meteorite. The origin of the observed differences is discussed. A simple model combining the results of both our nanoindentation and HP-XRD measurements allows us to describe the contribution of macroscopic and chemical-bond related effects, both of which are necessary to reproduce the observed elastic modulus softening. Such joint analysis of the mechanical and elastic properties of meteorites and returned samples opens up a new avenue for characterizing these highly interesting materials.

Title: Emergent cell migration from cell shape deformations and T1 transitions
Authors: Harish P. Jain, Richard D.J.G. Ho, Luiza Angheluta
Abstract: T1 transitions, which are localised cell rearrangements, play an important role in the fluidization of epithelial monolayers. Using a multi-phase field model and an active elastic solid model, we show that although each cell undergoes T1 transitions in time as uncorrelated, random events, the spatial distribution of these events is highly correlated and is dependent on cell shape. T1 transitions have a dual effect. Cells losing neighbours tend to relax their shape, while those gaining neighbours tend to elongate. By analysing the statistics of successive T1 transitions undergone by a deformable cell, we find asymmetric spatial distributions related to how cells lose or gain neighbours. These asymmetric spatial patterns of T1 transitions promote directed cell migration, and form the backbone for coherent flow patterns at tissue scales.

Title: Structural Changes and Percolation Transition in Networks after Aging Processes
Authors: Ryuho Sekikawa, Hiroshi Watanabe
Abstract: In social networking services, users constantly change, and the network structure changes simultaneously. As the network structure changes, so does the word-of-mouth within it. To study how information transfer on the network changes with the aging of the network, we investigated the relation of the structure and the percolation in the aged networks. We first prepared the Bianconi-Barabási model as the initial network and observed the time evolution of its properties by repeatedly deleting and adding nodes. We introduced two tunable parameters, the deleting parameter $\alpha$ and the adding parameter $\beta$, and observed the aging behavior for the various parameter sets. We found that the network did not reach its steady state depending on the parameters. We also found that when the network is stable, there is a parameter region where the degree distribution changes from power-law to exponential decay. We performed the percolation analyses and found that the behavior of the percolation probability changes simultaneously with changes in the network's structure. This study is expected to help control network structure in steady-state aged networks.

Title: The quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole and the area law
Authors: Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: The area law obeyed by the thermodynamic entropy of black holes is one of the fundamental results relating gravity to statistical mechanics. In this work we provide a derivation of the area law for the quantum relative entropy of the Schwarzschild black-hole for arbitrary Schwarzschild radius. The quantum relative entropy between the metric of the manifold and the metric induced by the geometry and the matter field has been proposed in G. Bianconi "Gravity from entropy", Phys. Rev. D (2025) as the action for entropic quantum gravity leading to modified Einstein equations. The quantum relative entropy generalizes Araki entropy and treats the metrics between zero-forms, one-forms, and two-forms as quantum operators. Although the Schwarzschild metric is not an exact solution of the modified Einstein equations of the entropic quantum gravity, it is an approximate solution valid in the low coupling, small curvature limit. Here we show that the quantum relative entropy associated to the Schwarzschild metric obeys the area law for large Schwarzschild radius. We provide a full statistical mechanics interpretation of the results.

Title: Orthogonal projections of hypercubes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.

Title: Symmetry Breaking Dynamics in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Hui Yu, Zi-Xiang Li, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry has emerged as a powerful tool for characterizing symmetry breaking in quantum many-body systems. In this Letter, we explore how symmetry is dynamically broken through the lens of entanglement asymmetry in two distinct scenarios: a non-symmetric random quantum circuit and a non-symmetric Hamiltonian quench, with a particular focus on U(1) symmetry. In the former case, the symmetry is initially broken and subsequently restored, whereas in the latter case, symmetry remains broken in the subsystem at late times, consistent with the principles of quantum thermalization. Notably, the growth of entanglement asymmetry exhibits unexpected overshooting behavior at early times in both contexts, contrasting with the behavior of charge variance. We also consider dynamics of non-symmetric initial states under the symmetry-breaking evolution. Due to the competition of symmetry-breaking in both the initial state and Hamiltonian, the early-time entanglement asymmetry can increase and decrease, while quantum Mpemba effects remain evident despite the weak symmetry-breaking in both settings.

Title: Sliding of a liquid spherical droplet in an external insoluble liquid at low Reynolds numbers
Authors: Peter Lebedev-Stepanov
Abstract: The experiment shows that small liquid droplets under the action of gravity and the Archimedes force move in the external viscous liquid practically according to the Stokes drag force equation, and not in accordance with the Hadamard-Rybczynski (HR) formula, which was specially developed to describe the motion of a liquid droplet in an external viscous liquid. Various mechanisms are proposed to explain this: increased viscosity at the interface between two liquids and the presence of unaccounted surfactants. However, there is another fundamental mechanism that has not been taken into account. It can be expected that the velocities of such liquids, insoluble in each other, may not equalize at the boundary of the droplet. No slip condition may be may be unnatural at the droplet interface. In this paper, the Navier condition is applied to the liquid-liquid boundary for the first time. A generalized HR equation is obtained. If slip length {\lambda}=0 that equation transforms into the usual HR equation. At certain {\lambda}, we arrive at a model with continuity of the components of the viscous stress tensor at the interface of two fluids. For infinite viscosity of the drop, it becomes a well-known relation generalizing the Stokes drag force for a solid sphere, taking into account the boundary condition of partial slip.
