Title: Graphene Growth on Copper Substrate by LAMMPS Simulation
Authors: Lizhe Hong
Abstract: We learned the atomic deposition simulation of LAMMPS independently, referenced and optimized the modeling ideas of several papers, used the (1 1 1) crystalline surface of Cu atoms as a substrate, deposited C atoms produced by methane cleavage to obtain graphene flakes, and analyzed the deposition rate and deposition quality at three temperatures, obtaining conclusions consistent with the process flow. We found that there were obvious problems in previous papers. After a certain period, the overall system pressure became excessively high, causing simulation crashes and preventing analysis of subsequent results. In addition, understanding of potential function selection was incomplete. Therefore, after correcting these issues, a simulation system with relatively stable pressure was constructed. In addition to the result analysis, a potential-function selection table is provided, with some parameters taken from prior experimental calculations and others obtained via DFT calculations.

Title: From orbital analysis to active learning: an integrated strategy for the accelerated design of TADF emitters
Authors: Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Steve Cabrel Teguia Kouam, Patrick Mvoto Kongo, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence (TADF) emitters must satisfy two competing requirements: small singlet-triplet energy gaps for thermal upconversion and sufficient spin-orbit coupling for fast reverse intersystem crossing. Predicting these properties accurately demands expensive calculations. We address this using a validated semi-empirical protocol (GFN2-xTB geometries, sTDA/sTD-DFT-xTB excited states) on 747 molecules, combined with charge-transfer descriptors from Natural Transition Orbital analysis. The hole-electron spatial overlap She emerges as a key predictor, accounting for 21% of feature importance for the triplet state alone. Our best model (Support Vector Regression) reaches MAE = 0.024 eV and R2 = 0.96 for $\Delta E_{ST}$. Active learning reduces the data needed to reach target accuracy by approximately 25% compared to random sampling. Three application domains are explored: NIR-emitting probes for bioimaging, photocatalytic sensitizers, and fast-response materials for photodetection.

Title: Ferromagnetic Phase Transition of DPPH Induced by a Magic Angle Helical Magnetic Field
Authors: Emmanouil Markoulakis, John Chatzakis, Antonios Konstantaras, Iraklis Rigakis, Emmanuel Antonidakis
Abstract: We report the results and unique instrument configuration of a novel experiment in which we successfully transitioned a DPPH sample from its natural paramagnetic state and essentially a non-magnetic material to a ferromagnetic state at room temperature. This was achieved using a specifically applied helical flux magnetic field. The DPPH sample (2,2-diphenyl-1-picrylhydrazyl) remained ferromagnetic for at least one hour after the experiment, indicating that a transformation in the material was induced by the external field rather than being merely a temporary magnetic phase transition observed only during the experiment. The external magnetic field used had a helical pitch angle of approximately $54.7°$, known mathematically as the Magic Angle, relative to the +z-axis, which is aligned with the normal S to N external field's magnetic moment vector. Based on the phenomenology of the experiment, we infer that this specific magic angle corresponding to the known quantization precession spin angle of free electrons under a homogeneous straight flux magnetic field potentially enhances the percentage of unpaired valence electrons within the DPPH material, allowing them to align in parallel with the applied external field. Typically, in paramagnetic materials, the distribution of unpaired electrons' quantum spins relative to an external field is nearly random, showing roughly a 50% chance of either parallel or antiparallel alignment. Only a slight majority preference exists in one alignment direction due to the Boltzmann thermal distribution, which contributes to the paramagnetic nature of these materials. In our measurements, we found that the induced ferromagnetism of the DPPH sample resulted in an abnormal thousand-fold decimal value increase in relative magnetic permeability at ${\mu}{\approx}1.4$, compared to its typical paramagnetic value of $1.0001$ for this material.

Title: Chern Dartboard Superconductors
Authors: Rebecca Chan, Taylor L. Hughes
Abstract: We investigate the interplay of particle-hole symmetry and sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology by coupling a so-called Chern dartboard insulator (CDI) to a superconductor (SC) via the proximity effect. We dub the hybrid system, and equivalent intrinsically superconducting phases, a \emph{Chern dartboard superconductor} (CDSC). We show that a CDSC can have nontrivial sBZ topology if it arises from a CDI that has an even number of mirror symmetries $n$. On the other hand, particle-hole symmetry constrains a CDSC that arises from an odd-$n$ CDI to have trivial sBZ topology. However, we can circumvent this constraint for $n=1$ by inducing an FFLO-type pairing or shifting the CDI in momentum space, converting the mirror symmetry to a momentum-space nonsymmorphic mirror symmetry. With a superconducting pairing that preserves the (nonsymmorphic) mirror symmetries, even-$n$ CDIs and the shifted $n=1$ CDI can realize the minimal spinless phase that has a trivial total Chern number and nontrivial reduced Chern numbers. With a pairing that breaks the mirror symmetries, the hybrid system can realize phases that have nontrivial total and reduced Chern numbers, expanding the classification of phases that have sub-Brillouin zone (sBZ) topology. We also predict that some types of $n=2$ CDSCs inherit the quantized crystalline response of the $n=2$ CDI, providing experimentalists with a well-defined way to probe the CDSC. Our work motivates further exploration of sBZ topology, bulk topology, and quantized response.

Title: Nonequilibrium Exchange Nonlinear Hall Effect
Authors: John Tan, Oles Matsyshyn, Giovanni Vignale, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Quantum geometric electronic responses are often viewed through a non-interacting lens: independent quasiparticles accumulate Berry phases as they move through a static crystal and background potential. Here we argue that the combined action of electron-electron interactions and an out-of-equilibrium many-body state can produce striking departures from this familiar picture. We demonstrate how nonequilibrium exchange interactions produce a nonequilibrium collective quantum geometry distinct from that of its equilibrium ground state. We find this manifests as an exchange induced nonlinear Hall effect with nonlinear Hall current signals competitive with that of well-known non-interacting mechanisms. This highlights the critical role electron interactions and nonequilibrium states can play in the nonlinear response of quantum matter.

Title: Anderson localization of quantum droplets in disordered potentials
Authors: Zohra Mehri, Abdeaali Boudjemaa
Abstract: We study Anderson localization of a one-dimensional quantum droplet in a speckle-like potential employing the generalized Gross-Pitaevskii equation. We compute the droplet width, density profiles, diffusion exponent and coefficient, and the localization length for both small and large droplets. Interesting classes of anomalous diffusions are obtained in transport dynamics ranging from superdiffusion to subdiffusion for a strong disorder strength. We find that above a certain critical disorder strength the droplet exhibits a transition to Anderson localization. Our results can be redibly probed with recent experiments.

Title: Comparative Analysis of Autonomous and Systematic Control Strategies for Hole-Doped Hubbard Clusters: Reinforcement Learning versus Physics-Guided Design
Authors: Shivanshu Dwivedi, Kalum Palandage
Abstract: Engineering electron correlations in quantum dot arrays demands navigation of high-dimensional, non-convex parameter spaces where hole doping fundamentally alters the physics. We present a comparative study of two control paradigms for the one-hole, half-filled Hubbard model: (i) systematic physics-guided design and (ii) autonomous deep reinforcement learning with geometry-aware neural architectures. While systematic analysis reveals key design principles, such as field-induced localization for trapping the mobile hole, it becomes computationally intractable for optimization. We show that an autonomous RL agent, benchmarked across five 3D lattices from tetrahedron to FCC, achieves human-competitive accuracy (R^2 > 0.97) and 95.5 percent success on held-out tasks. The agent is 3-4 orders of magnitude more sample-efficient than grid search and outperforms other black-box optimization methods. Transfer learning yields 91 percent few-shot generalization to unseen geometries. This work establishes autonomous RL as a viable and highly efficient framework for rapid optimization and non-obvious strategy discovery in complex quantum systems.

Title: A "negative" route to pair density wave order
Authors: Hao-Xin Wang, Yi-Jian Hu, Wen Huang, Hong Yao
Abstract: Pair density waves (PDW) are novel forms of superconducting states that exhibit periodically modulated pairing. A remaining challenge is to elucidate how intrinsic PDW order can emerge robustly in strongly correlated electrons. Here we propose that PDW is prone to form in strongly coupled multiband superconductors simply with interband Cooper pairing between electrons from oppositely dispersing bands. This scenario is heuristically motivated by the observation that uniform interband pairing in such systems would exhibit negative superfluid weight -- a signature of an instability towards pairing modulation, implying that PDW emerges naturally in the true ground state. Using large-scale density-matrix-renormalization-group calculations with finite-size scaling analysis, we demonstrate this PDW mechanism in a minimal model with strong interband attractions. Our simulations reveal power-law superconducting correlations characterized by incommensurate modulations. The exponent $K_{sc}$ of the power-law PDW correlation decreases systematically with increasing ladder width, confirming a genuine long-range PDW order in the 2D limit. Our study therefore demonstrates a promising route to robust PDW states in multiband systems.

Title: Non-reciprocal Magnetoresistances in Chiral Tellurium
Authors: Shuchen Li, Chang Niu, Peide D. Ye, Axel Hoffmann
Abstract: Materials with broken fundamental symmetries, such as chiral crystals, provide a rich playground for exploring unconventional spin-dependent transport phenomena. The interplay between a material's chirality, strong spin-orbit coupling, and charge currents can lead to complex non-reciprocal effects, where electrical resistance depends on the direction of current and magnetic fields. In this study, we systematically investigate the angular dependencies of magnetoresistance in single-crystalline chiral Tellurium (Te). We observe distinct non-reciprocal magnetoresistances for magnetic fields applied along three orthogonal directions: parallel to the current along the chiral axis (z), in the sample plane but perpendicular to the current (y), and out of the sample plane (x). Through detailed analysis of the chirality- and thickness-dependence of the signals, we successfully disentangle multiple coexisting mechanisms. We conclude that the Edelstein effect, arising from the chiral structure's radial spin texture, is responsible for the non-reciprocity along the z-axis. In contrast, the chirality-independent signal along the y-axis is attributed to the Nernst effect, and the non-reciprocity along the x-axis may originate from intrinsic orbital magnetizations. These findings elucidate the complex interplay of spin, orbital, and thermal effects in Te, providing a complete picture of its non-reciprocal transport properties.

Title: Simultaneous measurement of thermal conductivity and specific heat in quasi-2D membranes by 3ω thermal transport
Authors: Yiwei Le, Erdong Song, Jason Li, Erik A. Henriksen
Abstract: Toward measuring the thermal properties of exfoliated atomically thin materials, we demonstrate simultaneous measurements of the thermal conductivity and specific heat in suspended membranes. We use the 3{\omega} technique applied to quasi-two-dimensional silicon nitride membranes having a metal line heater patterned on the surface to both deliver heat and directly measure the thermal impedance of the membrane at the heating frequency, Z(2{\omega}). We derive an expression for the complex thermal impedance as a function of frequency, approximating the actual rectangular membranes with a one dimensional model. The derivation accounts for potential parasitic heat loss mechanisms including conduction along the heater line, and by the gas load in an imperfect vacuum. Qualitatively, the thermal impedance response resembles a low-pass filter, owing to the combination of the total thermal resistance and total specific heat. Fitting Z(2{\omega}) to measurements across a few decades in frequency, we extract values of the thermal conductivity and specific heat of silicon nitride in agreement with literature values. We also study the dependence on the heating current, and compare to measurements of the thermal conductivity at zero frequency.

Title: A Landau Theory for Pair Density Modulation in Fe(Te,Se) flakes
Authors: Po-Juin Chan, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling.

Title: From Mono- to Hexa-Interstitials: Computational Insights into Carbon Defects in Diamond
Authors: Nima Ghafari Cherati, Arsalan Hashemi, Ádám Gali
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of carbon self-interstitial defects in diamond, ranging from mono- to hexa-interstitial complexes. By quantum mechanical density functional theory, empowered by interatomic potential models, we efficiently sample the complex configurational landscape and identify both known and previously unreported defect geometries. Our results reveal a pronounced energetic driving force for aggregation: the formation energy per interstitial decreases systematically from isolated split interstitials to compact multi-interstitial clusters, with the tetra-interstitial platelet emerging as a particularly stable structural motif. Additionally, charge analysis indicates that the predominantly covalent bonding in diamond becomes more polar within the defect centers. Analysis of defect energy levels shows that only the investigated mono-, di-, penta-, and hexa-interstitial complexes introduce in-gap electronic states, whereas the tri- and tetra-interstitial clusters are electronically inert. Vibrational spectroscopies further reveal that self-interstitials generate characteristic signatures. Short carbon-carbon bonds inside the defect cores give rise to high-frequency vibrational modes between 1375 and 1925 cm$^{-1}$, which are strongly IR-active but exhibit weak Raman activity. Taken together, these findings provide a coherent picture of the structural, electronic, and vibrational characteristics of carbon self-interstitials and establish a robust framework for their experimental identification.

Title: Polarons from first principles
Authors: Zhenbang Dai, Jon Lafuente-Bartolome, Feliciano Giustino
Abstract: This article reviews recent theoretical developments in the ab initio study of polarons in materials. The polaron is an emergent quasiparticle that arises from the interaction between electrons and phonons in solids, and consists of an electron or a hole accompanied by a distortion of the crystal lattice. Recent advances in experiments, theory, and computation have made it possible to investigate these quasiparticles with unprecedented detail, reigniting the interest in this classic problem of condensed matter physics. Recent theoretical and computational advances include ab initio calculations of polaron spectral functions, wavefunctions, lattice distortions, and transport and optical properties. These developments provide new insight into polaron physics, but they have evolved somewhat independently from the earlier effective Hamiltonian approaches that laid the foundation of the field. This article aims to bridge these complementary perspectives by placing them within a single unified conceptual framework. To this end, we start by reviewing effective Hamiltonians of historical significance in polaron theory, ab initio techniques based on density functional theory, and many-body first-principles approaches to polarons. After this survey, we outline a general field-theoretic framework that bridges between these diverse approaches to polaron physics. For completeness, we also review recent progress in the study of exciton polarons and self-trapped excitons and their relations to polarons. Beyond the methodology, we discuss recent applications to several classes of materials that attracted attention in the context of polaron physics.

Title: Modeling and Optimization of Two-Terminal Spin-Orbit-Torque MRAM
Authors: Md Nahid Haque Shazon, Piyush Kumar, Luqiao Liu, Daniel C. Ralph, Azad Naeemi
Abstract: This paper presents physical modeling and benchmarking for two-terminal spin-orbit torque magnetic random-access memory (2T-SOT-MRAM). The results indicate that the common SOT materials that provide only in-plane torque can provide little to no improvement over spin-transfer-torque (STT) MRAM in terms of write energy. However, emerging SOT materials that provide out-of-plane torques with efficiencies as small as 0.1 can result in significant improvements in the write energy for such 2-terminal devices, especially when the magnet lateral dimensions are scaled down to 30 or 20 nm. Additionally, a novel 2T-SOT MRAM device is proposed that can increase the path electrons pass through the SOT layer; hence, increasing the generated spin current and the energy efficiency of the device. Our benchmarking results indicate that an out-of-plane SOT efficiency of 0.051 for 20nm wide devices can result in write energies approaching SRAM at the 7nm technology node.

Title: Evaporative damping in open system theory of Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Nils A. Krause, Ashton S. Bradley
Abstract: We derive a new damping mechanism in the open quantum systems description of Bose-Einstein condensates. It stems from previously neglected terms in the derivation of the stochastic projective Gross-Pitaevskii equation (SPGPE), accounting for a nonlinear evaporation of particles from the coherent into the incoherent region. We demonstrate that the mechanism, while so far assumed to be of minor importance, is comparable in strength to the widely employed number damping. We also provide a simplified (pseudo)-local and a dimensionally reduced form of this evaporative damping. The process completes the SPGPE description of ultracold Bose gases giving a full first-principles picture of their evolution at finite temperature.

Title: Protocol to evaluate the viscoelastic response of a polymer suspension to an active agent via oscillatory shear rheometry
Authors: Kai Qi, Qingzhi Zou, Ignacio Pagonabarraga
Abstract: Microorganisms inhabit viscoelastic environments, where their locomotion can deform polymers and trigger local complex viscoelastic responses. However, a systematic approach to quantify such responses remains lacking. Here, we propose a protocol that maps the shear effect induced by an active agent to oscillatory shear rheometry. The central idea is to establish a correspondence between the mean shear rate generated by swimming and that produced by an oscillating plate. In this mapping, the swimming velocity and active stress are translated into an effective oscillation frequency and strain amplitude. The resulting viscoelastic response can then be evaluated by standard oscillatory rheometry. The protocol is validated using lattice Boltzmann simulations of a squirmer embedded in polymer solutions. Our framework is generic and can be naturally extended to active microrheology, providing a pathway to quantify swimmer-induced viscoelasticity.

Title: Ultrasonic observation of small Fermi surfaces in La$T$In$_5$ ($T$ = Co, Rh, Ir)
Authors: Ryosuke Kurihara, Yusuke Hirose, Kazuki Matsui, Atsushi Miyake, Ryoma Tsunoda, Masaki Kondo, Rikio Settai, Mitsuhiro Akatsu, Yuichi Nemoto, Hiroshi Yaguchi, Masashi Tokunaga
Abstract: We performed high-field ultrasonic measurements on La$T$In$_5$ ($T$ = Co, Rh, Ir) to reveal the origin of the small Fermi surface that was recently observed in LaRhIn$_5$ with an oscillation frequency of 6.8 T. We observed quantum oscillations originating from this Fermi surface in LaRhIn$_5$. In addition, we revealed that LaCoIn$_5$ and LaIrIn$_5$ exhibit quantum osciilations with frequencies below 100 T, indicating hidden Fermi surfaces in these compounds. Furthermore, Co-substituted LaRhIn$_5$ exhibited quantum oscillations with a frequency of 10 T. Our results suggest that the small Fermi surface originates from bulk properties and that $3d$ electrons of the transition metal contribute to its formation.

Title: Enhanced polariton interaction in the presence of disorder
Authors: Matthew Prest, Cassandra Imperato, Oleg L. Berman, David W. Snoke, Klaus Ziegler
Abstract: We consider the interaction between exciton-polaritons in a semiconductor quantum well, embedded in a microcavity, in the presence of disorder. The disorder acts on the excitons in the semiconductor quantum well. We have calculated the exciton and polariton self-energies and the exciton and polariton energy dispersion relations in the presence of disorder. Our results demonstrate that disorder increases the polariton-polariton interaction.

Title: Competing magnetic phases in Cr$_{3+δ}$Te$_4$ are spatially segregated

Abstract: Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ is a self-intercalated vdW system that is of current interest for its room-temperature FM phases and tunable topological properties. Early NPD measurements on the monoclinic phase Cr$_3$Te$_4$ ($x=0.5$) presented evidence for competing FM and AFM phases. Here we apply neutron diffraction to a single crystal of Cr$_{3+\delta}$Te$_4$ with $\delta=-0.10$ and discover that it consists of two distinct monoclinic phases, one with FM order below $T_{\rm C} \approx 321$ K and another that develops AFM order below $T_{\rm N} \approx 86$ K. In contrast, we find that a crystal with $\delta=-0.26$ exhibits only FM order. The single-crystal analysis is complemented by results obtained with NPD, XPD, and TEM measurements on the $\delta=-0.10$ composition. From observations of spontaneous magnetostriction of opposite sign at $T_{\rm C}$ and $T_{\rm N}$, along with the TEM evidence for both monoclinic phases in a single thin ($\approx$ 100 nm) grain, we conclude that the two phases must have a fine-grained ($\lesssim$ 100 nm) intergrowth character, as might occur from high-temperature spinodal decomposition during the growth process. Calculations of the relaxed lattice structures for the FM and AFM phases with DFT provide a rationalization of the observed spontaneous magnetostrictions. Correlations between the magnitude and orientation of the magnetic moments with lattice parameter variation demonstrate that the magnetic orders are sensitive to strain, thus explaining why magnetic ordering temperatures and anisotropies can be different between bulk and thin-film samples, when the latter are subject to epitaxial strain. Our results point to the need to investigate the supposed coexistence FM and AFM phases reported elsewhere in the Cr$_{1+x}$Te$_2$ system, such as in the Cr$_5$Te$_8$ phase ($x=0.25$).

Title: Angle evolution of the superconducting phase diagram in twisted bilayer WSe2

Abstract: Recent observations of superconductivity in twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ have extended the family of moiré superconductors beyond twisted graphene. In WSe$_2$ two different twist angles were studied, 3.65° and 5.0°, and two seemingly distinct superconducting phase diagrams were reported, raising the question of whether the superconducting phases in the two devices share a similar origin. Here we address the question by experimentally mapping the evolution of the phase diagram across devices with twist angles spanning the range defined by the initial reports, and comparing the results to twist angle-dependent theory. We find that the superconducting state evolves smoothly with twist angle and at all twist angles is proximal to a Fermi surface reconstruction with, presumably, antiferromagnetic ordering, but is neither necessarily tied to the Van Hove singularity, nor to the half band insulator. Our results connect the previously distinct phase diagrams at 3.65° and 5°, and offer new insight into the origin of the superconductivity in this system and its evolution as the correlation strength increases. More broadly, the smooth phase diagram evolution, repeatability between different devices, and dynamic gate tunability within each device, establish twisted transition metal dichalcogenides as a unique platform for the study of correlated phases as the ratio of interaction strength to bandwidth is varied.

Title: Robust AC vector sensing at zero magnetic field with pentacene
Authors: Boning Li, Garrett Heller, Jungbae Yong, Alexander Ungar, Hao Tang, Guoqing Wang, Patrick Hautle, Yifan Quan, Paola Cappellaro
Abstract: Quantum sensors based on electronic spins have emerged as powerful probes of microwave-frequency fields. Among other solid-state platforms, spins in molecular crystals offer a range of advantages, from high spin density to functionalization via chemical tunability. Here, we demonstrate microwave vector magnetometry using the photoexcited spin triplet of pentacene molecules, operating at zero external magnetic field and room temperature. We achieve full three-dimensional microwave field reconstruction by detecting the Rabi frequencies of anisotropic spin-triplet transitions associated with two crystallographic orientations of pentacene in deuterated naphthalene crystals. We further introduce a phase alternated protocol that extends the rotating-frame coherence time by an order of magnitude and enables sensitivities of approximately $1~\mu\mathrm{T}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ with sub-micrometer spatial resolution. These results establish pentacene-based molecular spins as a practical and high-performance platform for microwave quantum sensing in addition to demonstrating control techniques broadly applicable to other molecular and solid-state spin systems.

Title: Trion ordering in the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $π$-flux square lattice
Authors: Xiang Li, Yumeng Li, Quan Fu, Yu Wang
Abstract: Ultracold multicomponent fermions (atoms/molecules) loaded in optical lattices provide an ideal platform for simulating SU($N$) Hubbard models that host unconventional many-body quantum states beyond SU(2). A prime example is the attractive three-color Hubbard model, in which trion states emerge at strong coupling. Nevertheless, much of its trion ordering on two-dimensional lattices remains uncertain. Here, we employ the determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method to simulate the attractive three-color Hubbard model on a $\pi$-flux square lattice at half filling. We show that color-dependent attractive interaction can induce coexisting charge density wave (CDW) and Néel ordered states in the three-color $\pi$-flux Hubbard model. In particular, enhanced charge fluctuations (cf. honeycomb lattice) cause much stronger Néel ordering on the $\pi$-flux square lattice. The coexisting charge and Néel orders survive up to a melting temperature, at which they vanish simultaneously. The Ginzburg-Landau (GL) analysis on the coexistence of CDW and Néel orders demonstrates how color-dependent Hubbard interactions stabilize coexisting orders from the perspective of GL free energy principle.

Title: Scale-robust Low Resistance Transport in Atomic Layer Deposited Topological Semimetal Wafers on Amorphous Substrate
Authors: Dong-Hyun Lim, Young-Min Song, Yeji Kim, Ae Rim Choi, Hyun-Mi Kim, Hyeongkeun Kim, Sujin Kwon, Bonggeun Shong, Justin Shih, Asir Intisar Khan, Il-Kwon Oh
Abstract: As data-centric computing advances, energy-efficient interconnects are increasingly critical for AI-driven systems. Traditional metal conductors face severe limitations at nanoscale due to increased resistivity from surface scattering. In response, this study demonstrates the first wafer-scale realization of an amorphous topological semimetal, tantalum phosphide (TaP), grown directly on amorphous SiO2 substrates (without any seed layers) using low-temperature atomic layer deposition (ALD). The resulting TaP films exhibit unconventional resistivity scaling: decreasing resistivity with decreasing thickness, reaching 227 micro-ohm cm at ~2.3 nm film thickness. This behavior, observed without crystalline order or seed layers, indicates dominant surface conduction and establishes ALD-TaP as a promising candidate for back-end-of-line integration. The films also show excellent conformality, stoichiometry control, and thermal stability up to 600 degree C. A two-channel conduction model confirms surface-dominated transport in ultrathin regimes, further supported by enhanced conductivity in multi-stacked configurations. These findings highlight the potential of amorphous topological semimetals for future high-density, low-power electronic interconnects and expand the applicability of ALD for integrating novel quantum materials at scale.

Title: Radiation resistance of refractory high-entropy alloys
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are studied: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.

Title: Acoustoelectric Probing of Fractal Energy Spectra in Graphene/hBN Moiré Superlattices
Authors: Wenqing Song, Yicheng Mou, Qing Lan, Guorui Zhao, Zejing Guo, Jiaqi Liu, Tuoyu Zhao, Cheng Zhang, Wu Shi
Abstract: Moiré superlattices with long-range periodicity exhibit Hofstadter energy spectra under accessible magnetic fields, enabling the exploration of emergent quantum phenomena through a hierarchy of fractal states. However, higher-order features, located at elevated energies with narrow bandwidths, typically require high carrier densities and remain difficult to resolve using conventional electrical transport due to limited sensitivity and strong background conductivity. Here, we utilize acoustoelectric (AE) transport to probe high-order fractal states and the Hofstadter spectrum in graphene/hBN moiré superlattices. Surface acoustic waves on a ferroelectric LiNbO$_3$ substrate generate an AE voltage proportional to the derivative of electrical conductivity, significantly enhancing sensitivity to weak spectral features. Combined with substrate-induced high electron doping, this technique resolves fractal Brown-Zak oscillations up to the fifth-order and provides the first AE observation of the Hofstadter butterfly, revealing high-order fractal magnetic Bloch states and symmetry-broken Landau levels over a wide carrier density range. Our results establish AE transport as a powerful derivative-sensitive probe for emergent fractal quantum states in moiré-engineered 2D systems.

Title: Rewritable Complementary Nanoelectronics Enabled by Electron-Beam Programmable Ambipolar Doping
Authors: Qing Lan, Wenqing Song, Siyin Zhu, Yi Zhou, Lu Wang, Junjie Wei, Jiaqi Liu, Zejing Guo, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Hai Huang, Jingli Wang, Xiaodong Zhou, Alex Zettl, Jian Shen, Wu Shi
Abstract: The ability to reversibly and site-selectively tune ambipolar doping in a single semiconductor is crucial for reconfigurable electronics beyond silicon, but remains highly challenging. Here, we present a rewritable architecture based on electron-beam programmable field-effect transistors (FETs). Using WSe$_2$ as a model system, we demonstrate electron-beam-induced doping that enables reversible, precisely controlled carrier modulation exceeding $10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. The in-situ writing, erasing, and rewriting of ambipolar doping of nanoscale patterns was directly visualized by scanning microwave impedance microscopy. This mask-free, lithography-compatible approach can achieve precise band engineering within individual channels, yielding near-ideal subthreshold swings (~ 60 mV/dec) and finely tunable threshold voltages for both carrier types without specialized contact engineering. These capabilities allow on-demand realization of high performance logic, including CMOS inverters with high voltage gains and low power consumption, as well as NAND-to-NOR transitions on the same device via direct polarity rewriting. Our platform offers a scalable and versatile route for rapid prototyping of complementary electronics.

Title: Kitaev Meets AKLT: Competing Quantum Disorder in Spin-3/2 Honeycomb Systems
Authors: Sogen Ikegami, Kiyu Fukui, Rico Pohle, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: We investigate an S=3/2 quantum spin model on a two-dimensional honeycomb lattice that continuously interpolates between two paradigmatic quantum disordered states with distinct entanglement structures: the Kitaev quantum spin liquid and the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) valence bond solid. Combining classical, semi-classical, and exact diagonalization approaches, we map out the ground-state phase diagram and elucidate the role of quantum fluctuations across the entire parameter range. While classical and semi-classical frameworks predict noncoplanar orders competing with a collinear Néel state, we find these phases to be fragile: once full quantum fluctuations are included, they melt into a quantum-entangled state characterized by suppressed spin correlations and enhanced entanglement entropy. Our findings highlight how competition between qualitatively different quantum disordered phases provides a fertile playground for unconventional phases emerging from their interplay and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Effect of Spin-Orbit Coupling on Anomalous Quantum Oscillations in InAs/GaSb Quantum Wells
Authors: Xinlong Du, Chao Wang, Bo Ying, Juntao Song
Abstract: We theoretically study the effect of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) on anomalous quantum oscillations in InAs/GaSb quantum wells. By comparing different cases, we show that SOC induces two opposing effects on anomalous quantum oscillations: it suppresses the oscillations in the clean case, while enhancing them in the disordered case. Using an effective model, we analyze in detail the origins of anomalous oscillations in both clean and disordered cases. Based on these origins, we explain why SOC suppresses or enhances the anomalous oscillations in different cases, thereby extending the understanding of the conventional theory. Moreover, in the disordered case, SOC can induce a phase shift of the anomalous oscillations. We further identify a parameter window where the anomalous oscillations are significantly enhanced in the presence of both disorder and SOC. These results provide a theoretical basis for understanding the role of SOC in anomalous quantum oscillations.

Title: Quantum Spin Hall Effect and Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model Implementation in Novel C3N-based Dumbbell Morphologies
Authors: Deep Mondal, Arka Bandyopadhyay, Atanu Nandy, Debnarayan Jana
Abstract: Two-dimensional carbon nitride materials have been the center of attention for their diverse usage in energy harvesting, environmental remediation and nanoelectronic applications. A broad range of utilities with decent synthetic plausibility have made this family a sweet spot to dive into, whereas the underlying analytical aspects are yet to have prominence. Recently, using the machinaries of first principles, we reported a family of six different structures C3NX with a unique dumbbell-shaped morphology, functionalizing the recently synthesized monolayer of C3N. Here we have critically explored the non-trivial topological phases of the semimetallic Dumbbell C3NX sheets and nanoribbons. Spin-orbit coupling induced gap across the Fermi level, its subsequent tuning via an external electric field, portrayal of band inversion from the Berry curvature distribution and the evaluation of topological index using the Wannier charge center (WCC) firmly establishes the traces of topological footprint. The real space decimation scheme and Green function technique evaluate the underlying spectral information with corresponding transport characteristics. Fascinating features of these quasi-1D systems are observed utilizing the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model where different twisted phases reveal distinct topological signatures even in a low atomic mass system like DB C4N.

Title: Multipolar orbital relaxation of the $t_{2g}$ states
Authors: Aurélien Manchon, Xiaobai Ning, Chi Sun, Tetsuya Sato, Takeo Kato, Tatiana Rappoport
Abstract: Using a nonperturbative approach, the relaxation rate of orbital dipolar and quadrupolar moments is computed analytically for the t2g states. In the presence of short-range impurities and in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, the orbital relaxation emerges from the competition between momentum scattering and the effect of the crystal field. In the case of weak disorder, the orbital relaxation time is proportional to the momentum scattering time: each scattering event contributes to destroying the orbital moment. In the case of strong disorder, the effect of the crystal field is averaged out, and the orbital relaxation time is inversely proportional to the momentum scattering. We finally find that the dipolar and quadrupolar orbital moments are coupled by the crystal field, resulting in a complex dynamical behavior upon orbital injection.

Title: Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons
Authors: Andrew S. Westover, Katie L. Browning, Antonino Cannavo, Ralph Gilles, Jiri Vacik, James F. Browning, Neelima Paul, Giovanni Ceccio, Vasyl Lavrentiev
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.

Title: Interface controlled Berry phase and anisotropic spin-charge conversion in altermagnet-topological insulator bilayers
Authors: Juhi Singh, Narayan Mohanta
Abstract: We propose an altermagnet-topological insulator bilayer as a platform to engineer Berry phase driven spin-charge responses using an interfacial buffer layer. Using a momentum-space lattice model and linear-response theory, we investigate a $d$-wave altermagnet coupled to a topological insulator and highlight the crucial role of spin-flip tunneling in shaping its electronic and transport properties. Interfacial hybridization strongly modifies the band structure, leading to anisotropic Rashba-Edelstein and Hall responses. The spin-flip component of the coupling induces an inverse $d$-wave spin texture in the altermagnetic bands, signaling the onset of an altermagnetic topological phase. This coupling also renders the Rashba-Edelstein effect strongly in-plane anisotropic, enhancing the transverse response relative to ferromagnetic or antiferromagnetic analogues. These results establish interfacial spin-flip tunneling as a practical control knob for direction-sensitive, stray-field-free spin-charge conversion in correlated topological heterostructures.

Title: Stacking-sliding and irradiation-direction invariant Floquet altermagnets in A-type antiferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Zhe Li, Lijuan Li, Mengxue Guan, Sheng Meng
Abstract: Arranging the stacking orders of A-type antiferromagnetic (A-AFM) bilayers offers an accessible pathway to two-dimensional altermagnets, but requires strict symmetry conditions such as layer groups, sliding positions, and twisting angles. Here, we find that circularly polarized light (CPL) irradiation breaks time-reversal symmetry, enabling the development of altermagnets beyond these constraints. Based on symmetrical analysis, our revealments indicate that A-AFM bilayer building-blocks with inversion symmetry exhibit altermagnetism robust to stacking sliding and variations of illumination directions. These bilayers can be constructed from arbitrary ferromagnetic monolayers and guided by the $d$-electron counting rule. Adopting bilayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ as a template, out-of-plane illumination with CPL reveals an $f$-wave altermagnetic feature at sliding positions $\left\{E|\left(0,0\right)\right\}$, $\left\{E|\left(\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3}\right)\right\}$ and $\left\{E|\left(\frac{2}{3},\frac{1}{3}\right)\right\}$, while a $p$-wave feature is predicted at other sliding positions. Our unveilings popularize the applicability of altermagnets in A-AFM bilayers with inversion symmetry, igniting a new wave of research in this field.

Title: Thermodynamic description of world GDP distribution over countries
Authors: Klaus M. Frahm, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We apply the concept of Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization of classical fields for a description of the world Gross Domestic Product (GDP) distribution over countries. The thermalization appears due to a variety of interactions between countries with conservation of two integrals being total GDP and probability (norm). In such a case there is an emergence of Rayleigh-Jeans condensation at states with low GDP. This phenomenon has been studied theoretically and experimentally in multimode optical fibers and we argue that it is at the origin of emergence of poverty and oligarchic phases for GDP of countries. A similar phenomenon has been discussed recently in the framework of the Wealth Thermalization Hypothesis to explain the high inequality of wealth distribution in human society and companies at Stock Exchange markets. We show that the Rayleigh-Jeans thermalization well describes the GDP distribution during the last 50 years.

Title: Odd viscosity and anomalous Hall effect in two dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder
Authors: D.S. Zohrabyan, M.M. Glazov
Abstract: A microscopic theory of odd viscosity in two-dimensional electron systems with smooth disorder and spin-orbit interaction is developed. It is shown that spin-orbit scattering gives rise to an off-diagonal component of the viscosity tensor. Hydrodynamic equations for spin and electric currents are derived for electrons interacting with smooth disorder. The contribution of odd viscosity to the anomalous Hall effect is calculated.

Title: Moiré pattern multiplicity driven by electronic effects in two-dimensional CrCl3/Au heterostructures
Authors: Eugenio Gambari, Hugo Le Du, Mathieu Lizée, Arindam Mukherjee, Laurent Limot, Fabrice Scheurer, Marie D'angelo, François Debontridder, Tristan Cren, Marie Hervé
Abstract: Moiré patterns are a central motif in van der Waals heterostructures arising from the superposition of two-dimensional (2D) incommensurate lattices. These patterns reveal a wealth of correlated effects, influencing electronic, magnetic, and structural phenomena. While diffraction techniques typically resolve multiple moiré wave-vectors corresponding to the incommensurate nature of the underlying lattices, Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) often reveals only a dominant superperiod. In this work, we address this apparent discrepancy through an STM study of a twisted monolayer of CrCl3 on Au(111). We observe the coexistence of several moiré patterns at a fixed twist angle, whose relative intensity depends on the tunneling bias. Fourier analysis of STM data uncovers hidden higher-order moiré components not visible in STM topographic images, while spectroscopy maps reveal that the spectral weight of each pattern varies with electron energy. Our results establish that STM selectively probes on the same area distinct moiré modulations depending on electronic confinement, providing a unified framework that reconciles real space and reciprocal space observations of complex moiré superstructures.

Title: Phase-Factor-Controlled Surface Spirals in the Magnetic Conical Phase: The Role of In-Plane Directionality
Authors: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
Abstract: In chiral magnets, the magnetic textures surrounding domain walls exhibit a rich variety of structures, offering insights into fundamental physics and potential applications in spintronic devices. Conical spirals and related structures possess intrinsic in-plane directionalities governed by phase factors $\phi_0$, which are often obscured in long spirals due to cylindrical symmetry but become prominent in short spirals or thin films. Using micromagnetic simulations, we systematically studied magnetic textures at ferromagnetic-conical interfaces (FCI), including 1D and 2D FCIs with various shapes. Surface spirals (SS) emerge adjacent to these FCIs, closely linked to the cone's in-plane reorientation. In 1D FCIs, reorientation controls the presence, shape, and topological charge of the SS, with a discontinuity point observed where spirals with opposite charges form on opposite sides. In 2D FCIs, eyebrow-like SS are evident. The reorientation angle between top and bottom SS is controlled by the film thickness, similar to stacked spirals reported previously. We further demonstrate that SSs form at the facets of skyrmion clusters within the conical phase, as confirmed by both simulations and Lorentz transmission electron microscopy observations in Co$_8$Zn$_{10}$Mn$_2$ thin films. The experiments specifically reveal two distinct formation pathways: thermally activated co-growth and field-driven transformation from residual helices. These findings establish $\phi_0$ as a fundamental control parameter for magnetic states, enabling promising spintronic functionalities such as multi-state memory through SS polymorphism and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing via controlled topological transitions.

Title: Robust Superconductivity and High Upper Critical Fields in Epitaxial cubic W2N Thin Films
Authors: Aditya Singh, Arnaud le Febvrier, Sanath Kumar Honnali, Abhisek Mishra, Grzegorz Greczynski, Subhankar Bedanta, Per Eklund, Ajay Soni
Abstract: Transition Metal Nitrides are a versatile class of materials, combining chemical robustness, high hardness, and superconducting behaviour with critical temperatures between 2 to 10 K. While several binary TMNs have been explored, superconductivity in stoichiometric W2N has remained largely unexplored. Here, we report on superconducting thin films of stoichiometric W2N, demonstrating a distinctly high upper critical field of 8.5 T, uncommon among binary TMNs. This robust superconducting response under high magnetic fields highlights the technological relevance of W2N for integrated quantum and cryogenic electronic platforms. Overall, these results position stoichiometric W2N as a promising addition to the TMN superconducting landscape, opening new avenues for functional materials design based on chemically stable and mechanically resilient nitrides.

Title: Topological Defect Mediated Helical Phase Reorientation by Uniaxial Stress
Authors: Tae-Hoon Kim, Haijun Zhao, Brandt A. Jensen, Liqin Ke, Lin Zhou
Abstract: Strain engineering enables precise, energy-efficient control of nanoscale magnetism. However, unlike well-studied strain-dislocation interactions in mechanical deformation, the spatial evolution of strain-induced spin rearrangement remains poorly understood. Using \emph{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy, we manipulate and observe helical domain reorientation under quantitatively applied uniaxial tensile stress. Our findings reveal striking similarity to plastic deformation in metals, where the critical stress for propagation vector (\emph{\textbf{Q}}) reorientation depends on its angle with the stress direction. Magnetic defects mediate reorientation via "break-and-reconnect" or "dislocation gliding-annihilation" processes. Simulations confirm that strain-induced anisotropic Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction may play a key role. These insights advance strain-driven magnetism and offer a promising route for energy-efficient magnetic nanophase control in next-generation information technology.

Abstract: The combination of the well-known Cahn-Hilliard and Allen-Cahn equations is used to describe surface processes, such as simultaneous adsorption/desorption and surface diffusion. In the present paper we have considered the convective-viscous Cahn-Hilliard/Allen-Cahn equation complemented by memory effects. Exact solutions are obtained and the combined action of the applied field, dissipation and memory are discussed.

Title: Interplay of Ferromagnetic and Antiferromagnetic Interactions in Epitaxial Co$_3$PdN
Authors: Sita Dugu, Sharad Mahatara, Corlyn E Regier, James R Neilson, Stephan Lany, Rebecca W. Smaha, Sage R Bauers
Abstract: Antiperovskite nitrides with the general formula M$_3$N have attracted significant attention due to their tunable electronic and magnetic properties. Among them are many cobalt-based compounds predicted to exhibit high thermodynamic stability and intriguing magnetic behavior. Here, we report the synthesis and magnetic characterization of epitaxial Co$_3$ZnN thin films grown by radio frequency sputtering on SrTiO$_3$ (STO) and MgO substrates. X-ray diffraction confirms phase-pure (00l)-oriented films with cube-on-cube epitaxy on STO, with a c-lattice parameter of 3.752 angstroms. Magnetic measurements reveal clear hysteresis at 2 K with a coercive field of ~ 0.12 T and a small net moment of 0.11 ${\mu}_B$/f.u., suggesting either a canted antiferromagnetic (AFM) or ferrimagnetic (FiM) configuration. Temperature-dependent magnetization measurements show a transition near 25 K, with strong AFM interactions (Curie-Weiss $\Theta$ = -80.6 K) at high temperatures and short-range ferromagnetic correlations ($\Theta$ = +9.7 K) emerging near the transition. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) and Monte Carlo simulations indicate a ferromagnetic (FM) ground state, with the FM-AFM energy difference decreasing systematically with increasing supercell size, consistent with competition between FM and AFM/FiM interactions. These results highlight Co$_3$ZnN as a magnetically complex antiperovskite nitride with competing exchange interactions.

Title: Statistical physics for artificial neural networks
Authors: Zongrui Pei
Abstract: The 2024 Nobel Prize in Physics was awarded for pioneering contributions at the intersection of artificial neural networks (ANNs) and spin-glass physics, underscoring the profound connections between these fields. The topological similarities between ANNs and Ising-type models, such as the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model, reveal shared structures that bridge statistical physics and machine learning. In this perspective, we explore how concepts and methods from statistical physics, particularly those related to glassy and disordered systems like spin glasses, are applied to the study and development of ANNs. We discuss the key differences, common features, and deep interconnections between spin glasses and neural networks while highlighting future directions for this interdisciplinary research. Special attention is given to the synergy between spin-glass studies and neural network advancements and the challenges that remain in statistical physics for ANNs. Finally, we examine the transformative role that quantum computing could play in addressing these challenges and propelling this research frontier forward.

Title: Chemical Vapor Deposition of Nitrides by Carbon-free Brominated Precursors
Authors: Stefano Leone, Teresa Duarte, Hanspeter Menner, Jannik Richter, Lutz Kirste, Sven Maegdefessel, Felix Hoffmann, Byeongchan So, Ruediger Quay
Abstract: The epitaxial growth of group 13-nitride semiconductors (GaN, AlN, and AlGaN alloys) for the mass production and fabrication of high-frequency and high-power devices relies on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) using metal-organic molecules, also called precursors. While this growth method ensures high productivity and low operation costs compared to other methods, its most significant disadvantage lies in the presence of carbon atoms in the precursors, which are unavoidably incorporated into the epitaxial layers and hamper the performance of most types of fabricated devices. Carbon-free precursors for the CVD process could enhance the performance of high-frequency and high-power nitride-based devices while maintaining growth capability in industrial equipment. In this work, we implement gallium- and aluminum-brominated precursors, which contain no carbon atoms, to grow GaN and AlN layers in an industrial CVD system. We compare the results of this alternative CVD process with the conventional method using trimethyl precursors through several characterization techniques, indicating a clear reduction in optically active carbon-related defects.

Title: Localization, transport, flux induced extended modes and mobility edge in a self-similar corral substrate
Authors: Sayan Bhattacharya, Rhiddha Acharjee, Atanu Nandy
Abstract: We address that a single-band tight-binding Hamiltonian defined on a self-similar corral substrate can give rise to a set of non-diffusive localized modes that follow the same hierarchical distribution. As the lattice, the spatial extent of quantum prison containing a cluster of atomic sites is dependent on the generation of fractal structure. Apart from the quantum imprisonment of the excitation, a magnetic flux threading each elementary plaquette is shown to destroy the boundedness and generate an absolutely continuous sub-band populated by resonant eigen functions. Flux induced engineering of quantum states is corroborated through the evaluation of inverse participation ratio and quantum transport. Moreover, the robustness of the extended states has been checked in presence of diagonal disorder and off-diagonal anisotropy. Flux modulated single-particle mobility edge is characterized through mutlifractal analysis. Quantum interference is the essential issue, reported here, that manipulates the kinematics of the excitation and this is manifested by the workout of persistent current.

Title: Coincidence detection techniques for direct measurement of many-body correlations in strongly correlated electron systems
Authors: Yuehua Su, Guoya Zhang, Chao Zhang, Dezhong Cao
Abstract: Research on strongly correlated electron systems faces a fundamental challenge due to the complex nature of intrinsic many-body correlations. A key strategy to address this challenge lies in advancing experimental methods that can directly probe and elucidate the underlying many-body correlations. In this perspective article, we discuss the theoretically proposed coincidence detection techniques, which are designed to directly measure two-body correlations in various particle-particle and particle-hole channels, with momentum, energy, and/or spatial resolution. We also explore the prospects of these coincidence detection techniques for future theoretical and experimental developments. The successful implementation and refinement of these coincidence detection techniques promise to deliver powerful new approaches for unraveling long-standing puzzles in strongly correlated electron systems, such as the enigmatic mechanism of unconventional superconductivity and the long-sought quantum spin liquids. Furthermore, these coincidence detection techniques will offer powerful new methods to investigate novel phenomena like itinerant magnetism and electronic nematicity in quantum materials.

Title: Doping induced magnetism and half-metallicity in nanoribbons of quartic dispersion materials
Authors: Aliyev Emin, Arash Mobaraki, Hâldun Sevinçli, Seymur Jahangirov
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quartic dispersion materials are known to develop magnetization upon doping. Here we conduct a systematic investigation of magnetization in hole-doped quartic dispersion materials (GaS, InSe, TiO$_{2}$), focusing on the effects of structural confinement from 2D monolayers to quasi-one-dimensional nanoribbons (NRs). Upon hole doping, these NRs develop itinerant magnetization across a broad range of carrier densities and display half-metallic behavior. The spin-polarization energies ($E_{sp}$) of these NRs enhance remarkably relative to their 2D counterparts, with maximum increase being in the case of TiO$_{2}$ from 31 to 103 meV/carrier. The $E_{sp}$ strongly depends on the degree of localization of the magnetic moments along the width of NRs, which is determined by edge passivation and ribbon width. Strong deformation of the topmost valence bands at higher dopings indicates deviation from the Stoner mechanism.

Title: Compression-driven jamming in porous cohesive aggregates
Authors: Sota Arakawa
Abstract: I investigate the compression-driven jamming behavior of two-dimensional porous aggregates composed of cohesive, frictionless disks. Three types of initial aggregates are prepared using different aggregation procedures, namely, reaction-limited aggregation (RLA), ballistic particle-cluster aggregation (BPCA), and diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA), to elucidate the influence of aggregate morphology. Using distinct-element-method simulations with a shrinking circular boundary, I numerically obtain the pressure as a function of the packing fraction $\phi$. For the densest RLA and the intermediate BPCA aggregates, a clear jamming transition is observed at a critical packing fraction $\phi_{\rm J}$, below which the pressure vanishes and above which a finite pressure emerges; the transition is less distinct for the most porous DLA aggregates. The jamming threshold depends on the initial structure and, when extrapolated to infinite system size, approaches $\phi_{\rm J} = 0.765 \pm 0.004$ for RLA, $0.727 \pm 0.004$ for BPCA, and $0.602 \pm 0.023$ for DLA, where the errors denote the standard error. Above $\phi_{\rm J}$, the pressure follows $P \approx A {( \phi - \phi_{\rm J} )}^{2}$, which implies that the bulk modulus $K$ of jammed aggregates is proportional to $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Rigid-cluster analysis of jammed aggregates shows that the average coordination number within the largest rigid cluster increases linearly with $\phi - \phi_{\rm J}$. Taken together, these relations suggest that the elastic response of compressed porous aggregates is analogous to that of random spring networks.

Title: Freestanding Thin-Film Materials
Authors: Li Liu, Peixin Qin, Guojian Zhao, Zhiyuan Duan, Jingyu Li, Sixu Jiang, Xiaoyang Tan, Xiaoning Wang, Ziang Meng, Zhiqi Liu
Abstract: Freestanding thin films, a class of low-dimensional materials capable of maintaining structural integrity without substrates, have emerged as a forefront research focus. Their unique advantages-circumventing substrate clamping, liberating intrinsic material properties, and enabling cross-platform heterogeneous integration-underpin this prominence. This review systematically summarizes core fabrication techniques, including physical delamination (e.g., laser lift-off, mechanical exfoliation) and chemical etching, alongside associated transfer strategies. It further explores the induced strain modulation mechanisms, extreme mechanical properties and interface decoupling effects enabled by these films. Representative case studies demonstrate breakthrough applications in flexible/ultrathin electronics, ultrahigh-sensitivity sensors and the exploration of novel quantum states. Critical challenges regarding scalable fabrication, precise interface control, and long-term stability are analyzed, concluding with prospects for emerging applications in bio-inspired intelligent devices, quantum precision sensing, and brain-inspired neural networks.

Title: Full Electrical Switching of a Freestanding Ferrimagnetic Metal for Energy-Efficient Bipolar Neuromorphic Computing
Authors: Li Liu, Peixin Qin, Xiang Wang, Xiaobo She, Shaoxuan Zhang, Xiaoning Wang, Hongyu Chen, Guojian Zhao, Zhiyuan Duan, Ziang Meng, Qinghua Zhang, Qiong Wu, Yu Liu, Zhiqi Liu
Abstract: Flexible electronics and neuromorphic computing face key challenges in material integration and function retention. In particular, freestanding membranes suffer from slow sacrificial layer removal and interfacial strain, while neuromorphic hardware often relies on area-intensive dual-device schemes for bipolar synaptic weights. Here, we present a universal strategy based on water-soluble Sr4Al2O7 sacrificial layers, enabling the rapid release of freestanding ferrimagnetic metal membranes, which exhibit deterministic spin-orbit torque switching characteristics with well-preserved perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and are potential for next-generation ultrafast information technology. Extending this approach, we realize single-device ferrimagnetic synapses exhibiting intrinsic bipolar resistive switching. When implemented in a ResNet-18 architecture, these devices achieve 92% accuracy on CIFAR-10 - comparable to floating-point software models - while halving device counts relative to differential-pair implementations. These results establish a scalable platform linking flexible spintronics with compact, high-performance neuromorphic systems, offering foundational advances for next-generation electronics and brain-inspired hardware.

Title: Surface energy-driven crumpling transition in a thin sheet under compression
Authors: Aashna Chawla, Deepak Kumar
Abstract: In our common experience, crumpling a sheet requires external compressive force and leads to a random network of folds. However, thin sheets have been theoretically predicted to spontaneously transition from a flat to a crumpled state driven by thermal fluctuations, a phenomenon that has been elusive in experiments. We report the first observation of a similar crumpling transition driven instead by surface energy. Using a sensitive experimental protocol, when we gently compress a thin polymer sheet weakly adhered to a hydrogel substrate it transitions to a self-crumpling state at a well defined critical compression independent of system details. The transition is marked by the percolation of a fold network, and a power law increase in fold density. Most remarkably, the crumpled state shows a tunable order of folds establishing the phenomenon's potential as a simple and scalable technique to do origami with extremely thin sheets.

Title: Spurious Strange Correlators in Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases
Authors: Wei-Liang Gao, Jie-Yu Zhang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Peng Ye
Abstract: Strange correlator is a powerful tool widely used in detecting symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases. However, the result of strange correlator crucially relies on the adoption of the reference state. In this work, we report that an ill-chosen reference state can induce spurious long-range strange correlators in trivial SPT phases, leading to false positives in SPT diagnosis. Using matrix product state (MPS) representation, we trace the origin of these spurious signals in trivial SPT phases to the magnitude-degeneracy of the transfer matrix. We systematically classify three distinct mechanisms responsible for such degeneracy, each substantiated by concrete examples: (1) the presence of high-dimensional irreducible representations in the entanglement space; (2) a phase mismatch in symmetry representations between the target and reference states; and (3) long-range order arising from symmetry breaking. Our findings clarify the importance of the choice of proper reference states, providing a guideline to avoid pitfalls and correctly identify SPT order using strange correlators.

Title: Learning Thermoelectric Transport from Crystal Structures via Multiscale Graph Neural Network
Authors: Yuxuan Zeng, Wei Cao, Yijing Zuo, Fang Lyu, Wenhao Xie, Tan Peng, Yue Hou, Ling Miao, Ziyu Wang, Jing Shi
Abstract: Graph neural networks (GNNs) are designed to extract latent patterns from graph-structured data, making them particularly well suited for crystal representation learning. Here, we propose a GNN model tailored for estimating electronic transport coefficients in inorganic thermoelectric crystals. The model encodes crystal structures and physicochemical properties in a multiscale manner, encompassing global, atomic, bond, and angular levels. It achieves state-of-the-art performance on benchmark datasets with remarkable extrapolative capability. By combining the proposed GNN with \textit{ab initio} calculations, we successfully identify compounds exhibiting outstanding electronic transport properties and further perform interpretability analyses from both global and atomic perspectives, tracing the origins of their distinct transport behaviors. Interestingly, the decision process of the model naturally reveals underlying physical patterns, offering new insights into computer-assisted materials design.

Title: Exploring electron spin dynamics in spin chains using defects as a quantum probe
Authors: L. Soriano, A. Manoj-Kumar, G. Gerbaud, A. Savoyant, R. Dassonneville, H. Vezin, O. Jeannin, M. Orio, M. Fourmigué, S. Bertaina
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of the electron spin resonance of topological defects (edge state) in dimerized chains. These objects are discontinuities of the spin chain protected by the properties of the global system leading to a quantum many-body multiplet protected from the environment decoherence. Despite recent achievements in the realization of isolated and finite spin chains, the potential implementation in quantum devices needs the knowledge of the relaxation and decoherence sources. Our study reveals that electron spin lattice relaxation is governed at lowest temperatures by phonon-bottlenecked process and at high temperature by the chain dimerization gap. We show that the inter edge-state effective dipolar field is reduced by the intrachain exchange coupling leading to a longer coherence time than isolated ions at equivalent concentration. Ultimately, we demonstrate that the homogeneous broadening is governed by the intra-chain dipolar field, and we establish design principles for optimizing coherence in future materials.

Title: Residual Force Determines Surface Tension in Active Systems
Authors: Bal Krishan
Abstract: The mechanical tension at the interface of motility-induced phase separating active Brownian particles (ABPs) remains an open question. Here, we determine the surface tension by analyzing the spatial distribution of forces at the molecular level in a slab-confined system of ABPs exhibiting high and low density regions separated by a one-dimensional active interface. Unlike previous approaches that evaluate active and interaction stresses independently - often producing near-zero or negative surface tension - we show that on average, interaction forces act antagonistically to active propulsion, reducing the net force experienced by particles. By evaluating the work required to bring a particle to the interface using this total-force framework, we find a positive and physically consistent surface tension. These results reframe the mechanical interpretation of local stresses and provide a generalizable method for connecting microscopic force distributions to emergent interfacial properties in nonequilibrium systems.

Title: Does Fermi Level Alignment Hold Across Organic Interfaces? -- An Investigation Using a Rotary Kelvin Probe
Authors: Masahiro Ohara, Taiyo Inoue, Yuya Tanaka, Hisao Ishii
Abstract: Understanding energy level alignment at organic interfaces is crucial for optimizing the performance of organic devices. Interface dipole and band bending significantly influence carrier recombination and generation mechanisms. A method of simulating energy level alignment at metal/organic and organic/organic interfaces by assuming a thermal equilibrium model has been proposed, but its validation against experimental methods is still limited. In this study, the work function change in the $\alpha$-NPD/HAT-CN/Au interface was measured as a typical donor/acceptor system using a rotary Kelvin probe (RKP). Our findings demonstrate good agreement with simulations only at metal/organic interfaces which have "active" charge transfer. It is suggested that thermal equilibrium is not achieved simply by depositing the film under dark condition, and some treatment to supply carriers, such as exposure to UV light, is necessary for accurate evaluation. At the organic/organic interface, the the experimental results did not agree with thermal equilibrium model, highlighting the need to consider substrate-driven carrier supply and polarization effects when evaluating energy level alignment.

Title: Nanocrystals Heterostructures based on Halide Perovskites and Metal Sulfides
Authors: Nikolaos Livakas, Juliette Zito, Yurii P. Ivanov, Clara Otero Martínez, Giorgio Divitini, Ivan Infante, Liberato Manna
Abstract: We report the synthesis of nanocrystal heterostructures composed of CsPbCl3 and PbS domains sharing an epitaxial interface. We were able to promote the growth of a PbS domain (in competition with the more commonly observed Pb4S3Cl2 one) on top of the CsPbCl3 domain by employing Mn2$^+$ ions, the latter acting most likely as scavengers of Cl$^-$ ions. Complete suppression of the Pb4S3Cl2 domain growth was then achieved by additionally selecting an appropriate sulfur source (bis(trimethylsilyl)sulfide, which also acted as scavenger of Cl$^-$ ions), and reaction temperature. In the heterostructures, emission from the perovskite domain was quenched, while emission from the PbS domain was observed, pointing to a type-I band alignment, as confirmed by calculations. These heterostructures in turn could be exploited to prepare second-generation heterostructures through selective ion exchange on the individual domains (halide ion exchange on CsPbCl3, cation exchange on PbS). We demonstrate the cases of Cl$^-$ to Br$^-$ and Pb2$^+$ to Cu$^+$ exchanges, which deliver CsPbBr3@PbS and CsPbCl3@Cu2-xS epitaxial heterostructures, respectively.

Title: Halide Perovskite-Chalcohalide Nanocrystal Heterostructures as a Platform for the Synthesis and Investigation of the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 Epitaxial Interface
Authors: Nikolaos Livakas, Irina Skvortsova, Juliette Zito, Yurii P. Ivanov, Aswin Asaithambi, Andrea Toma, Annick De Backer, Muhammad Imran, Sandra Van Aert, Giorgio Divitini, Ivan Infante, Sara Bals, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Halide exchange in lead-based halide perovskites has been studied extensively. While mixed Cl-Br or Br-I alloy compositions can be formed with no miscibility gaps, this is precluded for mixed Cl-I compositions, due to the large difference in Cl and I ionic radii. Here, we exploit perovskite-chalcohalide CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures to study the Cl-I exchange and isolate new types of intermediate structures. The epitaxial interface between the Pb4S3Cl2 chalcohalide and the CsPbCl3 perovskite domain significantly influences the intermediate stages of halide exchange in the perovskite domain, leading to coexisting CsPbCl3 and CsPbI3 domains, thereby delivering segmented CsPbI3-CsPbCl3-Pb4S3Cl2 energetically favorable heterostructures, with partial iodide alloying of the CsPbCl3 domain and at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. The I:CsPbCl3 domain between CsPbI3 and Pb4S3Cl2 enables a gradual lattice expansion across the heterostructure. This design accommodates interfacial strain, with a 5.6% mismatch at the CsPbCl3-CsPbI3 interface and a 3.4% mismatch at the perovskite-chalcohalide interface. Full halide exchange leads to CsPbI3-Pb4S3Cl2 heterostructures. Both in intermediate and fully exchanged heterostructures, the CsPbI3 domain is emissive. In the intermediate structures, the band alignment between the two perovskite domains is type-I, with carriers photogenerated in the CsPbCl3 domain quickly transferring to the CsPbI3 domain, where they can recombine radiatively.

Title: Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Yantao Wu
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.

Title: Light-Emitting Diodes based on Metal Halide Perovskite and Perovskite Related Nanocrystals
Authors: Ying Liu, Zhuangzhuang Ma, Jibin Zhang, Yanni He, Jinfei Dai, Xinjian Li, Zhifeng Shi, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Light-emitting diodes (LEDs) based on halide perovskite nanocrystals have attracted extensive attention due to their considerable luminescence efficiency, wide color gamut, high color purity, and facile material synthesis. Since the first demonstration of LEDs based on MAPbBr3 nanocrystals were reported in 2014, the community has witnessed a rapid development in their performances. In this review, we provide a historical perspective of the development of LEDs based on halide perovskite nanocrystals and then present a comprehensive survey of current strategies to high-efficiency lead-based perovskite nanocrystals LEDs, including synthesis optimization, ion doping/alloying and shell coating. We then review the basic characteristics and emission mechanisms of lead-free perovskite and perovskite-related nanocrystals emitters in environmentally friendly LEDs, from the standpoint of different emission colors. Finally, we cover the progress in LED applications and provide an outlook of the opportunities and challenges for future developments in this field.

Title: Polaron-Driven Spin Funneling through Rashba-Split Bands in Mixed-Phase Quasi-Two-Dimensional Ruddlesden-Popper Perovskites
Authors: Sushovan Sarkar, Koushik Gayen, Ashish Soni, Suman Kalyan Pal
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites (MHPs) exhibit pronounced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) as a result of their heavy metal constituents, leading to distinctive electronic properties such as Rashba type band splitting which make them promising candidates for next generation spintronic applications. Here, using circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) and polarization dependent pump-probe spectroscopy, we found that spin polarization is present across all phases of our two-dimensional (2D) Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) mixed-phase perovskites, (C6H7SNH3)2 (CH3NH3)n-1PbnI3n+1 (n=1-4), irrespective of the number of inorganic layers. The origin of these spin polarized bands is attributed to the Rashba effect. Interestingly, the highly disordered nature of this system facilitates remarkably efficient ultrafast funneling of photoexcited spin-polarized excitons from the pure 2D phase (n=1) to higher-n phases at room temperature. We demonstrate that significant polaron formation due to the inherent soft crystal lattice and higher exciton-phonon interaction is responsible for the observed spin funneling effect in mixed-phase 2D RP perovskites. Polaron act as a protective mechanism for spin-polarized excitons, preserving their spin information through the screening of omnipresent phonon-induced momentum scattering. These findings not only offer valuable guidance for the design of 2D RP perovskites with pronounced Rashba effects but also unveil a compelling class of solution-processed perovskites capable of efficient spin-preserving energy transport at room temperature.

Title: Near-Infrared Light Emitting Metal Halides: Materials, Mechanisms, and Applications
Authors: Ying Liu, Francesco Di Stasio, Chenghao Bi, Jibin Zhang, Zhiguo Xia, Zhifeng Shi, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Near-Infrared (NIR) light emitting metal halides are emerging as a new generation of optical materials owing to their appealing features, which include low-cost synthesis, solution processability and adjustable optical properties. NIR emitting perovskite-based light-emitting diodes (LEDs) have reached an external quantum efficiency (EQE) over 20% and a device stability of over 10,000 h. Such results have sparked an interest in exploring new NIR metal halide emitters. In this review, we summarize several different types of NIR-emitting metal halides, including lead/tin bromide/iodide perovskites, lanthanide ions doped/based metal halides, double perovskites, low dimensional hybrid and Bi3+/Sb3+/Cr3+ doped metal halides, and assess their recent advancements. The characteristics and mechanisms of narrow-band or broadband NIR luminescence in all these materials are discussed in detail. We also highlight the various applications of NIR-emitting metal halides and provide an outlook for the field.

Title: Breaking the Boundaries of the Goldschmidt Tolerance Factor with Ethylammonium Lead Iodide Perovskite Nanocrystals
Authors: C. Meric Guvenc, Stefano Toso, Yurii P. Ivanov, Gabriele Saleh, Sinan Balci, Giorgio Divitini, Liberato Manna
Abstract: We report the synthesis of ethylammonium lead iodide (EAPbI3) colloidal nanocrystals as another member of the lead halide perovskites family. The insertion of an unusually large A-cation (274 pm in diameter) in the perovskite structure, hitherto considered unlikely due to the unfavorable Goldschmidt tolerance factor, results in a significantly larger lattice parameter compared to the Cs-, methylammonium- and formamidinium-based lead halide perovskite homologues. As a consequence, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are highly unstable, evolving to a non-perovskite delta-EAPbI3 polymorph within one day. Also, EAPbI3 nanocrystals are very sensitive to electron irradiation and quickly degrade to PbI2 upon exposure to the electron beam, following a mechanism similar to that of other hybrid lead iodide perovskites (although degradation can be reduced by partially replacing the EA+ ions with Cs+ ions). Interestingly, in some cases during this degradation the formation of an epitaxial interface between (EAxCs1-x)PbI3 and PbI2 is observed. The photoluminescence emission of the EAPbI3 perovskite nanocrystals, albeit being characterized by a low quantum yield (around 1%), can be tuned in the 664-690 nm range by regulating their size during the synthesis. The emission efficiency can be improved upon partial alloying at the A site with Cs+ or formamidinium cations. Furthermore, the morphology of the EAPbI3 nanocrystals can be chosen to be either nanocube or nanoplatelet, depending on the synthesis conditions.

Title: Morphology-engineered nanostructured silver- and antimony-telluride films for flexible thermoelectric generators
Authors: Ankit Kashyap, Conner Wallace, Geetu Sharma, Collin Rowe, Mahima Sasikumar, Niraj Kumar Singh, Per Eklund, Theodorian Borca-Tasciucc, Ganpati Ramanath, Ajay Soni
Abstract: Harvesting low-grade heat to electricity is attractive for powering wearable electronic devices. Here, we demonstrate nW-scale thermoelectric power generation in devices from thin film assemblies of microwave-synthesized p-Sb2Te3 nanoplates and n-Ag2Te nanowires on polyvinylidene fluoride membranes. While microwave cycling is crucial for Ag2Te nanocrystal shaping, Sb2Te3 formation is sensitive to precursors and surfactant concentrations. Introducing S doping in Sb2Te3 in the 1 - 1.5 atomic percent range via thioglycolic acid during synthesis yields an up to eightfold higher power-factor, due to a fivefold increase in electrical conductivity and 25% increase in Seebeck coefficient. Our microfilm devices generate up to 33.6 mV from 5 deg C to 50 deg C thermal gradients, with 120 nW maximum power output at Delta T 30 deg C, which is sixtyfold higher than Sb2Te3 paper devices. Mechanical bending can increase device resistance by up to 125% due to diminished inter-nanostructure electronic transport. These findings provide insights for integrating synthesis, morphology engineering and device design for next-generation wearable thermoelectric systems.

Title: Free energy dissipation and a decomposition of general jump diffusions on $\mathbb{R}^n$ without detailed balance
Authors: Shuyuan Fan, Qi Zhang
Abstract: We analyze the thermodynamic structure of jump diffusions combining Brownian and Poisson noise, a class of stochastic dynamics relevant to nonequilibrium statistical physics. For such nonlocal dynamics, the free energy admits a full dissipation formula that decomposes into entropy production and housekeeping heat. A central result is a decomposition of the generator into symmetric and anti-symmetric parts with respect to the invariant measure $\rho_{ss}$. The symmetric sector corresponds to a reversible dynamics and yields a nonlocal Fisher information governing free-energy decay, whereas the anti-symmetric sector generates a canonical conservative flow that produces circulation but no dissipation. Several numerical examples demonstrate how this decomposition clarifies the structure of nonequilibrium stationary states in jump-driven systems.

Title: Exchange interaction in ACu3Fe2Re2O12 quadruple perovskites
Authors: Fedor Temnikov, Alexey V. Ushakov, Evgenia V. Komleva, Zhehong Liu, Youwen Long, Valentin Yu. Irkhin, Sergey V. Streltsov
Abstract: Quadruple perovskites ACu$_3$Fe$_2$Re$_2$O$_{12}$ attract considerable interest due to their high Curie temperatures (up to $710$K), which strongly depend on the A-site cation. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate their electronic structure and magnetic exchange interactions. A band mechanism of magnetism that explains the antiferromagnetic character of the exchange interactions and their strong dependence on the filling of the Re $t_{2g}$ states is proposed. These antiferromagnetic interactions stabilize ferrimagnetic ground state. The calculated Curie temperatures, obtained within the Onsager reaction field theory, are in a good agreement with experimental data.

Title: Observation of Stable Bimeron Transport Driven by Spoof Surface Acoustic Waves on Chiral Metastructures
Authors: Huaijin Ma, Te Liu, Jiachen Sheng, Kaiyan Cao, Jinpeng Yang, Jian Wang
Abstract: Topological quasiparticles, such as merons and bimerons, are characterized by non-trivial textures that exhibit remarkably robust transport against deformation, offering significant potential for information processing. While these phenomena have been explored in various systems, acoustic realizations remain challenging. Here, we report that acoustic meron topological textures were successfully realized using designed Archimedeanlike square spiral metastructures via the excitation of spoof surface acoustic waves (SSAWs). By applying mirror-symmetric combinatorial operations to the unit structures, we further construct composite chiral metastructures that enable both one-dimensional and two-dimensional stable transport of acoustic bimerons. It is further revealed that bimeron transport originates from the locked opposite phase differences of SSAWs, induced by the handedness of the cavity resonant modes. The intrinsic robustness of the meron textures against structural defects is confirmed through the calculation of their topological charge. Our findings establish stable acoustic bimeron transport as a topologically resilient foundation for future acoustic information processing and storage technologies.

Title: Interactions of electrons and Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors
Authors: Arthur Christianen, Anna M. Seiler, Alperen Tüğen, Ataç İmamoğlu
Abstract: Rydberg excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors provide sensitive and non-destructive probes of physics in proximal sample layers that host correlated electronic states. In particular, electron or hole doping of the sample layer is heralded by a strong frequency shift and loss of transition strength of 2s excitons in the sensor layer; these features have been attributed to the formation of a bound state of a 2s exciton and a remote electron. Through a theoretical analysis of exciton-electron scattering, we show that the experimental spectra can only be explained by electron-mediated hybridization of 2s, 2p and interlayer excitons, leading to a new type of many-body state which we term Rydberg attractive polaron. We anticipate that this new understanding will ensure a more accurate assessment of the signatures of correlated electrons in two dimensional materials.

Title: Geometry protected probabilistic structure in many-body dynamics
Authors: Yue Liu, Chushun Tian, Dahai He
Abstract: Insomuch as statistical mechanics circumvents the formidable task of addressing many-body dynamics, it remains a challenge to derive macroscopic properties from a solution to Hamiltonian equations for microscopic motion of an isolated system. Launching new attacks on this long-standing problem -- part of Hilbert's sixth problem -- is urgently important, for focus of statistical phenomena is shifting from a fictitious ensemble to an individual member, i.e. a mechanically isolated system. Here we uncover a common probabilistic structure, the concentration of measure, in Hamiltonian dynamics of two families of systems, the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) model which is finite-dimensional and (almost) ergodic, and the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE) which is infinite-dimensional and suffers strong ergodicity breaking. That structure is protected by the geometry of phase space and immune to ergodicity breaking, leading to counterintuitive phenomena. Notably, an isolated FPUT behaves as a thermal ideal gas even for strong modal interaction, with the thermalization time analogous to the Ehrenfest time in quantum chaos, while an isolated GPE system, without any quantum inputs, escapes the celebrated ultraviolet catastrophe through nonlinear wave localization in the mode space, and the Rayleigh-Jeans equilibrium sets in the localization volume. Our findings may have applications in nonlinear optics and cold-atom dynamics.

Title: Spontaneous Transition from Conformal to Two-Dimensional Growth in Ge/GeSn Core/Shell Nanowires
Authors: Simone Assali, Sebastian Koelling, Milenka Andelic, Lu Luo, Gianluigi Botton, Oussama Moutanabbir
Abstract: GeSn semiconductors are group-IV isovalent alloys that offer remarkable tunability of optoelectronic properties across the entire infrared spectrum, while remaining fully compatible with silicon processing standards. These attributes make GeSn a promising platform for scalable sensing, imaging, and communication technologies. Yet, the influence of dimensionality on GeSn crystal growth remains poorly understood, limiting the development of integrated nanoscale infrared devices. Here, we reveal the spontaneous formation of hitherto unreported ultra-thin GeSn fins with sub-30 nm thickness during vapor-phase growth on Ge nanowire substrates. A transition from the typical conformal GeSn shell to distinct fin-like structures occurs along the nanowire growth axis and is accompanied by ordered twin defects extending longitudinally and laterally, inducing a transition from diamond to hexagonal-like crystal structure. The fins exhibit uniform Sn incorporation of approximately 16 at.% throughout their volume, indicating high compositional homogeneity. These findings uncover an anisotropic growth regime in metastable GeSn alloys, enriching the fundamental understanding of nanoscale epitaxy.

Title: Surface-directed spinodal decomposition in binary fluid mixtures on an amorphous wall: A molecular dynamics study
Authors: Syed Shuja Hasan Zaidi, Madhu Priya, Sanjay Puri, Prabhat K. Jaiswal
Abstract: We present molecular dynamics (MD) results to discuss wetting kinetics in binary fluid mixtures ($A:B=50:50$) undergoing surface-directed spinodal decomposition (SDSD) on an amorphous wall. Our simulations show the formation of a wetting layer rich in the preferred $A$-type particles and bicontinuous domain morphology in the bulk. In addition, the mixture maintains connectivity between the bulk and the wetting layer through $A$-rich tubes throughout the depletion region. The wetting layer thickness coarsens as a power law, $R_1(t)\sim t^{\alpha}$, with two distinct growth regimes of $\alpha=1/3$ and $\alpha=1$ active for at least a decade. The computed crossover time for $\alpha=1/3 \to 1$ equaled the reported bulk crossover time, and the corresponding crossover length scale $R_c$ agrees well with the expression $\Lambda = \sqrt{2k/\gamma_0}$ given by Scholten et al.~[\emph{Macromolecules}2005, 38, 3515] for bicontinuous domains in aqueous polymer mixtures in the presence of only one dominant length scale. This agreement supports a hydrodynamic picture of diffusive growth for the interconnected wetting layer and bulk domains, where the bending contribution ($k$) of curvature-dependent $AB$ interfacial tension ($\gamma$) governs small-scale coarsening, producing $t^{1/3}$ growth. For length scales beyond $\Lambda$, capillary flows yield the viscous hydrodynamic regime ($\sim t$). Our results show no orientational effects on the domain coarsening parallel and perpendicular to the wall, contrasting many continuum models, including combinations with Flory-Huggins theory.

Title: Confinement-Driven Exciton Behavior in 2D Halide Perovskites from Dielectric-Dependent Hybrid Methods
Authors: Rafael B. Araujo, Mustafa Mahmoud Aboulsaad, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo, Tomas Edvinsson
Abstract: Understanding how dielectric anisotropy governs excitonic behavior in two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites is critical for predicting and engineering their optoelectronic properties. In this work, we investigate Cs(n+1)PbnBr3n+1 nanoplatelets (n = 2-5) experimentally and theoretically and show that the interplay between dielectric confinement and anisotropic screening critically determines both their electronic structure and excitonic landscape. To incorporate the dielectric screening effects, the Coulomb kernel in the Fock exchange term is refined using a model dielectric function together with a model Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. The exciton binding energies show a monotonic decrease from 0.26 eV to 0.21 eV from n = 2 to 5, with 20 meV decrease per layer up to n = 4, and thereafter less change. The relatively small change per layer is a consequence of the strong spatial localization of excitons. By analyzing directionally resolved dielectric tensors, we demonstrate that the in-plane dielectric constant predominantly dictates optical transitions and is close to converging to the bulk value already at n = 5, while the out-of-plane dielectric response reflects the confined nature of excitonic wave functions as expected. Our calculated absorption spectra capture experimental results within 0.02 eV throughout the confinement regime (n = 2-5). The effects of lattice dynamics on the dimensionally dependent dielectric response and subsequent exciton screening occurring on longer time-scales than the optical response are also analyzed, important for analysis and interpretation of exciton lifetime, diffusion, and band alignments. The results establish a clear correlation between dielectric anisotropy, electronic structure, and exciton binding energy at different timescales in layered perovskites, providing essential insight for the design of 2D optoelectronic materials and devices.

Title: Optical conductivity of a dirty current-carrying superconductor
Authors: Artem V. Polkin, Mikhail A. Skvortsov
Abstract: We develop a full microscopic theory for the optical conductivity, $\sigma(\omega)$, of a dirty current-carrying superconductor. Within the Keldysh sigma model formalism, we obtain the general analytical expression for $\sigma(\omega)$, applicable for arbitrary frequency $\omega$, temperature $T$, and dc supercurrent $I$. In addition to altering the usual Mattis-Bardeen conductivity, $\sigma_1(\omega)$, a finite supercurrent introduces two new contributions: $\sigma_2^\text{qp}(\omega)$ from quasiparticle redistribution and $\sigma_2^\text{SH}(\omega)$ from the amplitude (Schmid-Higgs) mode excitation by the ac field. We investigate, both analytically and numerically, the main features of the optical conductivity in the presence of a dc supercurrent. They include a peak in $\text{Re}\,\sigma(\omega)$ above the optical gap and a sign change of $\text{Im}\,\sigma(\omega)$, with both effects becoming more pronounced at higher $I$ and lower $T$. We also elucidate the role of inelastic relaxation, which governs the low-frequency response, leading to a giant microwave absorption and a suppression of the apparent superfluid density at the critical current. The optical conductivity measurement of a superconductor biased by a finite dc supercurrent enables the direct observation of the Schmid-Higgs mode via transport measurements.

Title: Probing Anharmonic Lattice Dynamics and Thermal Transport in Layered Perovskite LiYTiO4 Anode
Authors: Lin Zhang, Wen Liu, Mingquan He, Jun Huang
Abstract: Layered perovskite lithium yttrium titanate ($\rm LiYTiO_4$) has recently emerged as a promising low-potential, ultrahigh-rate intercalation-type anode material for lithium-ion batteries; however, its lattice dynamics and thermal transport properties remain poorly understood, limiting a complete evaluation of its practical potential. Here, we combine experimental measurements with theoretical modeling to systematically investigate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and heat transport in $\rm LiYTiO_4$. We employ a neural evolution potential (NEP)-based framework that integrates the temperature-dependent effective potential method with the Wigner thermal transport (WTT) formalism, explicitly including both diagonal and off-diagonal terms of the heat-flux operator. Zero-temperature phonon calculations reveal dynamical instabilities associated with $\rm TiO_6$ octahedral rotation, which are stabilized at finite temperatures through anharmonic renormalization. Using the WTT approach with contributions from phonon propagation and coherence contributions, we predict a room-temperature lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\rm L}$) of 3.8 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ averaged over all crystal orientations, in close agreement with the measured value of 3.2 \pm 0.08 $\rm Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$ for polycrystalline samples. To further examine the possible influence of ionic motion on high-temperature thermal transport, we compute $\kappa_{\rm L}$ using a Green-Kubo equilibrium molecular dynamics approach based on the same NEP, which yields consistent results with both experiment and WTT predictions, confirming the negligible role of Li-ion mobility in heat conduction. Our study not only identifies the ultralow thermal conductivity of $\rm LiYTiO_4$ as a key limitation for its practical application but also establishes a reliable computational framework for studying thermal properties in battery materials.

Title: Self-organized criticality in complex model ecosystems
Authors: Thibaut Arnoulx de Pirey
Abstract: We show that spatial extensions of many-species population dynamics models, such as the Lotka-Volterra model with random interactions we focus on in this work, generically exhibit scale-free correlation functions of population sizes in the limit of an infinite number of species. Using dynamical mean-field theory, we describe the many-species system in terms of single-species dynamics with demographic and environmental noises. We show that the single-species model features a random mass term, or equivalently a random space-time averaged growth rate, poising some species very close to extinction. This introduces a hierarchy of ever larger correlation times and lengths as the extinction threshold is approached. In turn, every species, even those far from extinction, are coupled to these near-critical fields which combine to make fluctuations of population sizes generically scale-free. We argue that these correlations are described by exponents derived from those of directed percolation in spatial dimension $d=3$, but not in lower dimensions.

Title: Remote epitaxial frustration
Authors: Taehwan Jung, Nicholas Hagopian, Anshu Sirohi, Quinn Campbell, Chengye Dong, Zachary T. LaDuca, Tamalika Samanta, Joshua Robinson, Paul M. Voyles, Jason K. Kawasaki
Abstract: Remote epitaxy relaxes the constraints of conventional epitaxy, to enable low defect density, chemically abrupt heterostructures and exfoliation of single crystalline membranes. However, definitive evidence for a true remote mechanism remains elusive because most experiments can be explained by alternative mechanism that are macroscopically indistinguishable from true remote epitaxy. Using GdAuGe films grown on graphene/SiC (0001), we present two signatures that cannot be explained by the leading alternatives to the remote mechanism: (1) a few atomic layer thick disordered interlayer at the GdAuGe/graphene interface and (2) a $30\degree$ rotated epitaxial relationship between the GdAuGe film and the SiC substrate. Density functional theory calculations indicate these signatures arise from remote epitaxial \textit{frustration}, a competition amongst epitaxy to the remotely screened substrate, to graphene, and to the graphene-induced interfacial reconstruction. Tuning the amplitudes and periodicities of these competing potentials provides new opportunities to intentionally disrupt long-range order.

Authors: Alexey Pavolotsky, François Joint, Udupa Sujit Manjunatha, Victor Belitsky, Denis Meledin, Takafumi Kojima, Sho Masui, Ravishankar Narayanan, Vincent Desmaris
Abstract: We report a Nb/Al-AlN /Nb superconducting tunnel junction process in which the AlN barrier is formed by plasma nitridation using a compact microwave electron-cyclotron-resonance (ECR) nitrogen plasma source integrated into a standard sputter cluster. This enables growth of uniform tunnel barriers across a broad range of specific resistances, with $R_n A$ down to $\approx 3,\Omega,\mu\mathrm{m}^2$. Junctions maintain excellent quality, exhibiting $R_j/R_n \ge 25$ at the highest barrier transparencies. We characterize resistivity, specific capacitance, and the evolution of junction parameters under room-temperature aging and thermal annealing. A consistent calibration of the junction specific capacitance $C_s$ versus $R_n A$ is established and independently validated by the performance of demonstrator SIS mixers designed using the extracted $C_s$.

Title: Statistical structural properties of many-body chaotic eigenfunctions and applications
Authors: Wen-ge Wang, Qingchen Li, Jiaozi Wang, Xiao Wang
Abstract: In this paper, we employ a semiperturbative theory to study the statistical structural properties of energy eigenfunctions (EFs) in many-body quantum chaotic systems consisting of a central system coupled to an environment. Under certain assumptions, we derive both the average shape and the statistical fluctuations of EFs on the basis formed by the direct product of the energy eigenbases of the system and the environment. Furthermore, we apply our results to two fundamental questions: (i) the properties of the reduced density matrix of the central system in an eigenstate, and (ii) the structure of the off-diagonal smooth function within the framework of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Numerical results are also presented in support of our main findings.

Title: Boundary-Bulk Interplay in Nonlinear Topological Transport
Authors: Deyi Zhuo, Xiaoda Liu, Huu-Thong Le, Annie G. Wang, Han Tay, Bomin Zhang, Ling-Jie Zhou, Binghai Yan, Chao-Xing Liu, Cui-Zu Chang
Abstract: Nonlinear transport has emerged as a powerful approach to probe the quantum geometry of electronic wavefunctions, such as Berry curvature and quantum metric, in topological materials. While nonlinear responses governed by bulk quantum geometry and band topology are well understood, the role of boundary modes (e.g., edge, surface, and hinge states) in nonlinear transport of topological materials remains largely unexplored. In this work, we demonstrate boundary-bulk interplay in nonlinear transport, including second-harmonic Hall and nonreciprocal longitudinal responses, in molecular beam epitaxy-grown magnetic topological insulator heterostructures. We find that the nonlinear transport is maximized when the sample is tuned slightly away from the well-quantized states, including the quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulator states. The sign and amplitude of the nonlinear transport depend on electrode configuration, magnetic order, and carrier type, establishing boundary mode transport as the dominant contributor. These findings, supported by symmetry analysis and nonlinear Landauer-Büttiker formalism, demonstrate that nonlinear transport in topological materials is governed by the interplay between boundary and bulk states. We further derive a universal relation between different lead voltages from electrode geometry symmetry, which allows us to distinguish nonlinear boundary transport from bulk contributions. Our work highlights the critical role of electrodes in nonlinear transport, which is absent in nonlinear optics, and establishes boundary modes as a key origin of the giant nonlinear response in nearly bulk-insulating topological materials. This insight opens new opportunities for engineering nonlinear transport through boundary-bulk interplay in future device applications of topological materials.

Title: Electrostatic Screening in Nanotubes: A Tubular Response Function Framework
Authors: Peter Gispert, Nikita Kavokine
Abstract: The structure and transport of electrolytes in nanoscale channels are known to be affected by the electronic properties of the confining walls. This influence is particularly pronounced in quasi-one-dimensional nanotubes, where the high surface-to-volume ratio makes the wall the dominant source of electrostatic screening. For instance, ideal metallic tubes suppress long-range Coulomb interactions between ions exponentially. Yet, there exists no generic framework for evaluating electrostatic interactions in tubular confinement. Here, we introduce tubular response functions - a generalisation of surface response functions that captures how nanotubes with arbitrary electronic properties screen Coulomb interactions. Using this framework, we evaluate the interaction potential of ions confined in a metallic carbon nanotube, treating its electronic properties exactly within a Luttinger liquid model. We demonstrate that the long-range exponential screening characteristic of ideal metals persists in realistic metallic nanotubes, regardless of their electron density. We trace the origin of this perfect screening property to the quantum confinement of electrons along the tube circumference. Our framework opens the way for quantitative descriptions of ionic correlations and charge storage in nanotube-based electrodes, and can be further extended to address confined ion dynamics.

Title: Symmetry, Invariant Manifolds and Flow Reversals in Active Nematic Turbulence
Authors: Angel Naranjo, Rumayel Pallock, Caleb Wagner, Piyush Grover
Abstract: We investigate how symmetry, exact coherent structures (ECSs), and their invariant manifolds organize spontaneous flow reversals in a 2D active nematic confined to a periodic channel. In minimal flow units commensurate with the intrinsic active vortex scale, we use equivariant bifurcation theory to trace the origin of dynamically relevant ECSs via a sequence of symmetry-constrained local and global bifurcations. At low activity level, we identify relative periodic orbits, created via a sequence of SNIPER, homoclinic and heteroclinic bifurcations, whose invariant manifolds provide robust heteroclinic pathways between left- and right-flowing nearly uniaxial states. These result in several symmetry-dictated reversal mechanisms in the preturbulent regime, with and without vortex-lattice intermediate states. In the active turbulent regime, this ECS skeleton persists and organizes chaotic attractors exhibiting persistent two-way reversals. By classifying ECSs through their symmetry signatures, we relate a small set of ECSs embedded in turbulence back to the preturbulent branches, and show that typical turbulent trajectories repeatedly shadow these ECSs and their unstable manifolds, resulting in near-heteroclinic transitions between opposite-flow states. Our results establish that channel confined active nematic turbulence is organized by a low-dimensional, symmetry-governed network of invariant solutions and their manifolds, and identify dynamical mechanisms that could be exploited to design, promote, or suppress flow reversals in active matter microfluidic devices.

Title: Photodynamics and Temperature Dependence of Single Spin Defects in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Benjamin Whitefield, Ivan Zhigulin, Nicholas P. Sloane, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Igor Aharonovich, Mehran Kianinia
Abstract: Quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) that exhibit optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) signatures have recently garnered significant attention as an emerging solid-state platform for quantum technologies. However, the underlying spin dynamics, and the mechanisms determining the spin-dependent fluorescence in these defects are still poorly understood. In this work we perform detailed photodynamical studies of the spin complexes in hBN. In particular, we show that spin transitions are located within the metastable manifold which can be explained by the rate model, populating in a cascading manner. In addition, we perform temperature dependent measurements on these defects and show that the spin-lattice relaxation and coherence times increase as the temperature reduces. Furthermore, we find that the ODMR frequencies of the S=1 transition show only a marginal frequency shift as a function of temperature, which makes them a robust sensor at cryogenic temperatures. These insights are crucial for further understanding of the spin dynamics of quantum emitters in hBN and their practical implementation in quantum sensing.

Title: Evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization
Authors: Taiyang Zhang, Lujun Zhu, Zhihao Yan, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: Whether orbital polarization propagates has become the most essential question of the blooming orbitronics that aims to generate non-local orbital torque and orbital pumping. Recent theories have suggested a strong orbital Hall effect within the light metal Al and a strong orbital Rashba effect at Co/Al interfaces, providing ideal platforms for experimental verification of possible orbital transport effects. Here, we report robust experimental evidence for the strong localization of orbital polarization. We demonstrate that neither the bulk nor the interface of the Al contributes a detectable orbital torque on adjacent magnetic layer with strong bulk and interfacial spin-orbit coupling necessary for potential orbital-spin conversion. These results have clarified that orbital polarization undergoes much faster relaxation than spin polarization and hardly participates in non-local accumulation, transport, or torque generation. The experimental evidence for strong localization of orbital polarization represents a groundbreaking advance towards solving the essential orbital torque debate.

Title: Revisiting the theory of crystal polarization: The downside of employing the periodic boundary conditions
Authors: Qiu-Shi Huang, Su-Huai Wei
Abstract: Periodic boundary condition (PBC) is a standard approximation for calculating crystalline materials properties. However, a PBC crystal is not the same as the real macroscopic crystal, therefore, if applied indiscriminately, it can lead to erroneous conclusions. For example, unlike other extensive observables such as total energy, the polarization of a macroscopic crystal cannot always be described by a PBC model, because polarization is inherently nonlocal and strongly dependent on surface terminations, irrespective of crystal size, and moreover, the symmetry of the macroscopic crystal can be altered when the PBC is applied to a macroscopic crystal. We demonstrate in this paper that the polarization of a macroscopic crystal receives contributions from both the repeating bulk units and the crystal surfaces, which must be treated on an equal footing. When the combined system of the bulk and its surfaces are taken into account, materials traditionally classified as nonpolar can, in fact, admit polar symmetry, thus explaining why experimentalists have observed polarization in some nominally ``nonpolar'' systems. Our study, thus, clarifies that polarization can only exist in polar group systems and that apparent violations of Neumann's principle reported in some recent works originate from misinterpreting bulk PBC crystal as intrinsic macroscopic crystal, ignoring the contribution from the surfaces. We demonstrate that when the full bulk-plus-surface system is considered, the crystal polarization and symmetry is fully consistent with Neumann's principle.

Title: A Numerical Perspective on Moiré Superlattices: From Single-Particle Properties to Many-Body Physics
Authors: Xin Lu, Bo Xie, Jianpeng Liu
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in two-dimensional materials provide a versatile platform to explore strongly correlated and topological phases. This work presents a practical theoretical workflow for studying the correlated and topological states in moiré systems, combining continuum modeling, Hartree-Fock mean-field approximations, many-body perturbation theory, and exact diagonalizations. We focus on the numerical implementation of these methods, emphasizing subtleties such as remote band effects, inhomogeneous and dynamical screening, double counting problem, etc., which are often swept under the rug in theoretical works. The workflow enables a systematic investigation of symmetry-breaking ground state properties, quasiparticle excitation properties and fractional Chern insulator phases emerging from moiré superlattices, providing insights that are directly relevant to experimental observations. By bridging technical details and physical interpretations, this work aims to guide both theorists and experimentalists in understanding and predicting correlated phenomena in moiré materials.

Title: A fluorescent color center in meteoritic Lonsdaleite
Authors: Giannis Thalassinos, Alan G. Salek, Daniel Stavrevski, Qiang Sun, Mitchell O. de Vries, Colin M. MacRae, Nicholas C. Wilson, Andrew G. Tomkins, Dougal G. McCulloch, Andrew D. Greentree
Abstract: Lonsdaleite -- hexagonal diamond -- has only recently been proposed as a wide-bandgap host capable of supporting optically active point defects, but no such centres have yet been observed. Here we provide the first experimental evidence that lonsdaleite does in fact host photoluminescent color centres. In meteoritic lonsdaleite grains from the ureilite NWA7983, we identify a new defect, RU1, which exhibits bright and stable emission across 550-800 nm, with optimal blue excitation (~455 nm) and a peak at ~700 nm. Time-resolved photoluminescence reveals an excited-state lifetime of 14 ns with no detectable blinking, bleaching, or charge conversion. From the excitation-emission energetics we infer an unresolved zero-phonon line near 550 nm. Correlative electron microscopy confirms the lonsdaleite host lattice, and compositional analysis suggests N, Si, or Ni as plausible defect constituents. These results suggest lonsdaleite could become a new quantum-grade crystalline platform and indicate that hexagonal-diamond color centres may form a new and unexplored family of solid-state quantum emitters.

Title: Experimental Evidence of Néel-order-driven Magneto-optical Kerr Effect in an Altermagnetic Insulator
Authors: Haolin Pan, Rui-Chun Xiao, Jiahao Han, Hongxing Zhu, Junxue Li, Qian Niu, Yang Gao, Dazhi Hou
Abstract: The magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) is investigated in hematite, a collinear antiferromagnetic insulator, across a broad wavelength spectrum. By combining the optical measurements with magnetometry results, we unambiguously demonstrate that the Néel-order contribution dominates the MOKE signal, while contributions from net magnetization and external magnetic fields are negligible. This conclusion is quantitatively supported by first-principles calculations, and qualitatively by a symmetry analysis that the Néel contribution appears at the first order in spin-orbit coupling while the magnetization contribution starts only at the third order. This study clarifies the altermagnetic origin of the pronounced MOKE in hematite, underscoring the potential of altermagnets as a promising new class of magneto-optical materials.

Title: Nonreciprocal charge transport in an iron-based superconductor with broken inversion symmetry engineered by a hydrogen-concentration gradient
Authors: Takayuki Nagai, Yukito Nishio, Jumpei Matsumoto, Kota Hanzawa, Hidenori Hiramatsu, Hideo Hosono, Tsuyoshi Kimura
Abstract: The breaking of spatial inversion symmetry in condensed matter gives rise to intriguing physical properties, such as ferroelectricity, piezoelectricity, spin-momentum locking, and nonreciprocal responses. Here we propose that a concentration gradient, which often persists as a quasi-stable nonequilibrium state with long relaxation times in solids, can serve as a general platform for inversion symmetry breaking. We demonstrate this concept in an epitaxial thin film of the hydrogen-doped SmFeAsO (Sm1111:H) superconductor with a depthwise hydrogen-concentration gradient introduced via an optimized topotactic reaction. This film exhibits nonreciprocal charge transport, meaning that the electrical resistance depends on the direction of the applied current, which serves as a key signature of broken inversion symmetry. A pronounced nonreciprocal signal emerges in the vicinity of the superconducting transition, which we attribute to vortex-motion nonreciprocity arising from an asymmetric pinning landscape created by the hydrogen-concentration gradient. Owing to the high critical temperature of Sm1111:H, vortex-origin nonreciprocity is observed above 40 K, representing the highest temperature reported to date among single bulk materials without an artificially hetero-layered structure. Our findings establish concentration-gradient engineering as a versatile and broadly applicable route for realizing inversion-broken states in otherwise centrosymmetric hosts, opening pathways toward a broader landscape of odd-parity-driven functionalities.

Title: Spin and Orbital Magnetism in UH2 Thin Films Studied by X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism
Authors: Evgenia A. Tereshina-Chitrova, Mykhaylo Paukov, Oleksandra Koloskova, Amir Hen, Fabrice Wilhelm, Lukas Horak, Mayerling Martinez Celis, Miroslav Cieslar, Ladislav Havela, Andrei Rogalev, Thomas Gouder
Abstract: Uranium dihydride UH2 is a metastable phase unknown in bulk form but accessible through thin-film synthesis. We prepared UH2 films by reactive dc sputtering on CaF2(001) or Si(001) substrates, the latter equipped with a Mo buffer layer to suppress a U-Si interdiffusion. On CaF2, UH2 adopts the fluorite-type structure with a near-[1 1 1] out-of-plane texture, four rotational domains, and a lattice parameter a = 539 +- 3 pm without measurable strain, whereas the Mo-buffered film is polycrystalline. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy confirmed complete hydrogenation and minimal oxidation. Magnetization and XMCD measurements show ferromagnetic ordering with Curie temperatures of 120-130 K and a uranium 5f moment of 0.9 {\mu}B/U, dominated by the orbital contribution ({\mu}L ~ 1.4 {\mu}B, {\mu}S ~ -0.5 {\mu}B), in a good agreement with GGA+U computations, which otherwise overestimate absolute values of the spin and orbital components. The slightly reduced moment in thinner CaF2-supported films is attributed to surface U(IV) species. These results demonstrate that thin-film synthesis enables stabilization of UH2 and direct probing of 5f magnetism, opening pathways toward higher uranium hydrides and interface-engineered actinide systems.

Title: Microscopic signatures of Chern number sign reversal in twisted bilayer WSe2
Authors: Ke Lv, Ya-Ning Ren, Lin He
Abstract: The discovery of quantized Chern numbers in twisted transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) homobilayers,including 3.7{deg} twisted MoTe2 and 1.23{deg} twisted WSe2,has emerged as a defining breakthrough in physics. A striking and unresolved puzzle from these studies is the unexpected opposite sign of the observed Chern numbers between the two systems. Recent theory has proposed a twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in both twisted MoTe2 and WSe2, offering a potential explanation for the disparate experimental observations6. However, a direct experimental verification of the twist-angle-dependent Chern number sign reversal in a specific twisted TMD homobilayer is still elusive. Here, we report the first experimental demonstration that the Chern numbers of the moire frontier bands undergo sign reversal at a critical twist angle 1.42{deg} in twisted WSe2 bilayers (tWSe2). Using scanning tunnelling microscopy and spectroscopy, we direct measure layer-pseudospin skyrmion textures of tWSe2 and our results reveal that tWSe2 in the vicinity of the 1.42{deg} exhibits a twist-angle-dependent layer-pseudospin polarization, an effect that serves as the fundamental origin of the observed Chern number sigh reversal6-12.

Title: Local Reversibility and Divergent Markov Length in 1+1-D Directed Percolation
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: Recent progress in open many-body quantum systems has highlighted the importance of the Markov length, the characteristic scale over which conditional correlations decay. It has been proposed that non-equilibrium phases of matter can be defined as equivalence classes of states connected by short-time evolution while maintaining a finite Markov length, a notion called local reversibility. A natural question is whether well-known classical models of non-equilibrium criticality fit within this framework. Here we investigate the Domany--Kinzel model -- which exhibits an active phase and an absorbing phase separated by a 1+1-D directed-percolation transition -- from this information-theoretic perspective. Using tensor network simulations, we provide evidence for local reversibility within the active phase. Notably, the Markov length diverges upon approaching the critical point, unlike classical equilibrium transitions where Markov length is zero due to their Gibbs character. Correspondingly, the conditional mutual information exhibits scaling consistent with directed percolation universality. Further, we analytically study the case of 1+1-D compact directed percolation, where the Markov length diverges throughout the phase diagram due to spontaneous breaking of domain-wall parity symmetry from strong to weak. Nevertheless, the conditional mutual information continues to faithfully detect the corresponding phase transition.

Title: Novel coupling between charge order and time-reversal-symmetry-breaking superconductivity
Authors: Quanxin Hu, Lingfeng Zhang, Yu Zheng, Yongwei Li, Qiheng Wang, Xinyu Liang, Baiqing Lv, Chi-Ming Yim, Takuto Kawakami, Vadim Grinenko, Xiao Hu, Hong Ding
Abstract: The interplay between charge-density waves (CDWs), which break translational symmetry, and spatially homogeneous superconductivity, which breaks global U(1) gauge symmetry, can give rise to an intriguing phenomenon: the pair-density wave, characterized by a spatial modulation of the superconducting order parameter. Yet how CDWs couple to unconventional superconducting states-particularly those with time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB)-remains largely unexplored. Here, using scanning tunneling microscopy on heavily hole-doped Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$, which hosts an s $\pm$ is superconducting state, we reveal a previously unobserved coupling between a surface CDW and TRSB superconductivity. Experimentally, the TRSB superconductivity imparts "chirality" to the CDW, which manifests as commensurate domains separated by domain walls with $\pi$-phase slips-forming what we term a bipolar CDW. The domain walls delineate TRSB domains of opposite chirality, consistent with spontaneous breaking of U(1) $\times$ Z2. Supported by theoretical modelling, we construct a framework in which a hidden interfacial pair-density modulation (PDM) mediates a linear coupling between the surface CDW and interband Josephson currents of TRSB superconductivity. Crucially, the theory shows that realizing this linear coupling requires a controlled global phase difference $\delta$ $\phi$ = $\pi$/2 between the PDM and CDW states. Our results uncover a previously overlooked connection between charge ordering and TRSB superconductivity, opening a pathway to explore intertwined quantum orders in iron-based superconductors and other strongly correlated systems.

Title: Pauli Master Equation numerical analysis of coherent and incoherent dressed fermions in triplet unconventional superconductors
Authors: Pedro L. Contreras E
Abstract: We report two types of dressed fermions in a triplet superconductor with an in-situ disorder effective field. They are obtained numerically by analyzing with the Pauli Master Equation, the self-consistent imaginary part data of the elastic-scattering cross-section. We use a two-component irreducible representation of the order parameter with quasi-point nodes and study the quasi-classical effective probabilistic density distribution as function of disorder. We find a stable coherent quantum state of dressed fermions, and slow characteristic decay time for dilute disorder. Also, we find an incoherent quantum state with diffused dressed fermions and enriched disorder with self-consistency increasing decoherence, a fast characteristic decay time, and a diffuse unitary resonance. We conclude that the most stable dressed fermion states are those in which the field has dilute disorder, the threshold zero gap, and some dressed fermions behave like an s-wave superconductor, showing a tiny gap.

Title: Impact of Lattice Distortions on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy and Magnetization in (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B Alloys
Authors: Haruki Okumura, Takashi Miyake, Taro Fukazawa, Noritsugu Sakuma, Yuta Suzuki, Tetsuya Shoji, Hisazumi Akai, Masako Ogura, Tetsuya Fukushima
Abstract: Nd$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B -- a widely used permanent magnet -- has magnetocrystalline anisotropy constants that differ between the bulk and interface regions. This study explores the effects of lattice distortion on the magnetocrystalline anisotropy ($K_{\rm u}$) and magnetization of (Nd$_{1-x}$Pr$_x$)$_2$Fe$_{14}$B. Nd$_2$Fe$_{14}$B alloys were fabricated; scanning transmission electron microscopy revealed a compressive strain of up to 25% near grain boundaries. Using the full-potential Korringa--Kohn--Rostoker method, we calculated the strain dependence of $K_{\rm u}$, showing that although $K_{\rm u}$ is 4.2 MJ/m$^3$ under strain-free conditions at 0 K, it becomes negative in regions with 25% compressive strain. Additionally, Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B exhibits a larger $K_{\rm u}$ than Pr$_{2}$Fe$_{14}$B under undistorted conditions, whereas Pr-rich alloys exhibit a more pronounced reduction in $K_{\rm u}$ under strain. These findings highlight the critical influence of lattice distortions on magnetic properties. The calculated strain-dependent magnetic anisotropy parameters provide valuable inputs for future micromagnetic simulations, aiding the design of advanced magnetic materials.

Title: Equivariant Diffusion for Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Peijia Lin, Pin Chen, Rui Jiao, Qing Mo, Jianhuan Cen, Wenbing Huang, Yang Liu, Dan Huang, Yutong Lu
Abstract: In addressing the challenge of Crystal Structure Prediction (CSP), symmetry-aware deep learning models, particularly diffusion models, have been extensively studied, which treat CSP as a conditional generation task. However, ensuring permutation, rotation, and periodic translation equivariance during diffusion process remains incompletely addressed. In this work, we propose EquiCSP, a novel equivariant diffusion-based generative model. We not only address the overlooked issue of lattice permutation equivariance in existing models, but also develop a unique noising algorithm that rigorously maintains periodic translation equivariance throughout both training and inference processes. Our experiments indicate that EquiCSP significantly surpasses existing models in terms of generating accurate structures and demonstrates faster convergence during the training process.

Title: Quantum coherent states of mass-imbalanced electron-hole system within optical microcavities
Authors: Thi-Hau Nguyen, Thi-Hong-Hai Do, Van-Nham Phan
Abstract: The interplay of the excitoniclike polariton, polariton, and photoniclike polariton coherent states in mass-imbalanced electron-hole systems within optical microcavities is theoretically examined. Utilizing the unrestricted Hartree-Fock approximation, we derive a set of self-consistent equations that evaluate the excitonic and photonic order parameters in a two-band electronic model, accounting equally for both electron-hole Coulomb attraction and light-matter coupling. Analyzing the competition among these condensate order parameters reveals a complex phase structure of coherent states in the ground state. As the mass imbalance is reduced, we observe a transition from a normal disordered electron-hole-photon system to excitoniclike, polariton, and ultimately photoniclike polariton condensation states. The distinct features of these robust condensates can be identified in the momentum distribution of the electron-hole pair amplitude and the photonic density, as well as in the wave-number-resolved photoemission spectra of electrons, holes, and photons. Increasing the excitation density further expands the range of condensation states. Additionally, lowering the mass imbalance leads to the emergence of quantum coherent bound states prior to the formation of robust condensates, which are evidenced by the static and dynamical excitonic and photonic susceptibility functions.

Title: Towards probing velocity distributions in dense granular matter: Utilizing Fiber Bragg Gratings
Authors: Marlo Kunzner, Luis Henriques, Fahad Puthalath, Leonardo Facchini, Mohammadhossein Shahsavari, Léa Gommeringer, Martin Angelmahr, Peidong Yu, Till Böhmer, Jan Philipp Gabriel
Abstract: Granular gases are commonly characterized through their velocity distribution, which provides access to the granular temperature. In experiments, velocity distributions are typically obtained by particle tracking, which however becomes limited at moderate and high particle densities. As a way forward, we propose a new technique for measuring particle velocities in situ by using a Fiber Bragg Grating (FBG) sensor, which remains applicable at significantly higher particle this http URL FBG sensor detects strain pulses induced by particle-fiber collisions, from which the velocity of the impacting particle can be derived. Applying this method to an ensemble of granular particles allows to extract its velocity distributions as we present for a granular system excited by a vibrational shaker. We validate the extracted velocity distribution against conventional particle-tracking measurements, confirming the reliability of the FBG-based technique.

Title: Edge-Aware Graph Attention Model for Structural Optimization of High Entropy Carbides
Authors: Neethu Mohan Mangalassery, Abhishek Kumar Singh
Abstract: Predicting relaxed atomic structures of chemically complex materials remains a major computational challenge, particularly for high-entropy systems where traditional first-principles methods become prohibitively expensive. We introduce the edge-aware graph attention model, a physics-informed graph neural network tailored for predicting relaxed atomic structures of high-entropy systems. the edge-aware graph attention model employs chemically and geometrically informed descriptors that capture both atomic properties and local structural environments. To effectively capture atomic interactions, our model integrates a multi-head self-attention mechanism that adaptively weighs neighbouring atoms using both node and edge features. This edge-aware attention framework learn complex chemical and structural relationships independent of global orientation or position. We trained and evaluated the edge-aware GAT model on a dataset of carbide systems, spanning binary to high-entropy carbide compositions, and demonstrated its accuracy, convergence efficiency, and transferability. The architecture is lightweight, with a very low computational footprint, making it highly suitable for large-scale materials screening. By providing invariance to rigid-body transformations and leveraging domain-informed attention mechanisms, our model delivers a fast, scalable, and cost-effective alternative to DFT, enabling accelerated discovery and screening of entropy-stabilised materials.

Title: Multiplet structure of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap materials
Authors: Ilya Popov, Petros-Panagis Filippatos, Shayantan Chaudhuri, Andrei L. Tchougréeff, Katherine Inzani, Elena Besley
Abstract: Transition metal doping is commonly used for altering the properties of solid-state materials to suit applications in science and technology. Partially filled $d$-shells of transition metal atoms lead to electronic states with diverse spatial and spin symmetries. Chromium(III) cations have shown great potential for designing laser materials and, more recently, for developing spin qubits in quantum applications. They also represent an intriguing class of chemical systems with strongly correlated multi-reference excited states, due to the $d^3$ electron configuration. These states are difficult to describe accurately using single-reference quantum chemical methods such as density functional theory (DFT), the most commonly used method to study the electronic structures of solid-state systems. Recently, the periodic effective Hamiltonian of crystal field (pEHCF) method has been shown to overcome some limitations arising in the calculations of excited $d$-states. In this work, we assess the suitability of DFT and pEHCF to calculate the electronic structure and $d$-$d$ excitations of chromium(III) dopants in wide band gap host materials. The results will aid computational development of novel transition metal-doped materials and provide a deeper understanding of the complex nature of transition metal dopants in solids.

Title: Non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices
Authors: E. T. Kokkinakis, I. Komis, K. G. Makris, E. N. Economou
Abstract: Within the framework of non-Hermitian photonics, we investigate the spectral and dynamical properties of one- and two-dimensional non-Hermitian off-diagonal disordered optical lattices, where randomness is applied to the couplings rather than to the on-site potential terms. We analyze eigenvalue distributions and the localization properties of the eigenmodes, comparing them with those of the corresponding Hermitian lattices. Furthermore, we study their transport behavior under single-channel excitation and identify unconventional phenomena such as jumps between distant lattice regions in systems with a purely real spectrum, as well as complex spectrum-induced Anderson jumps, reported here for the first time in two dimensions. Our results establish a reference framework for non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder and open new directions for future studies of localization phenomena.

Title: Simple models for the trapping of charged particles and macromolecules by diffusiophoresis in salt gradients
Authors: Richard P. Sear, Patrick B. Warren
Abstract: We study the trapping of charged particles and macromolecules (such as DNA) in salt gradients in aqueous solutions. The source for the salt gradient can be as simple as a dissolving ionic crystal, as shown by McDermott et al. [Langmuir 28, 15491 (2012)]. Trapping is due to a competition between localisation due to diffusiophoresis in the salt gradient, and spreading out by diffusion. The size of the trap is typically 1 to 100 micrometres. We further predict that at steady state, the particle (macromolecule) number density is a power law of the salt concentration, with an exponent that is the ratio of the diffusiophoretic mobility to the diffusion coefficient of the trapped species. This ratio increases with size and typically becomes much greater than 1 for particles or macromolecules with hydrodynamic radii of hundreds of nanometres and above. Thus large particles or macromolecules are easily caught and trapped at steady state by salt gradients.

Title: Improving the Stability of Colloidal CsPbBr3 Nanocrystals with an Alkylphosphonium Bromide as Surface Ligand Pair
Authors: Meenakshi Pegu, Hossein Roshan, Clara Otero-Martinez, Luca Goldoni, Juliette Zito, Nikolaos Livakas, Pascal Rusch, Francesco De Boni, Francesco Di Stasio, Ivan Infante, Luca De Trizio, Liberato Manna
Abstract: In this study, we synthesised a phosphonium-based ligand, trimethyl(tetradecyl)phosphonium bromide (TTP-Br), and employed it in the post-synthesis surface treatment of Cs-oleate-capped CsPbBr3 NCs. The photoluminescence quantum yield (PLQY) of the NCs increased from 60% to more than 90%, as a consequence of replacing Cs-oleate with TTP-Br ligand pairs. Density functional theory calculations revealed that TTP+ ions bind to the NC surface by occupying Cs+ surface sites and orienting one of their P-CH3 bonds perpendicular to the surface, akin to quaternary ammonium passivation. Importantly, TTP-Br-capped NCs exhibited higher stability in air compared to didodecyldimethylammonium bromide-capped CsPbBr3 NCs (which is considered a benchmark system), retaining 90% of their PLQY after six weeks of air exposure. Light-emitting diodes fabricated with TTP-Br-capped NCs achieved a maximum external quantum efficiency of 17.2 %, demonstrating the potential of phosphonium-based molecules as surface ligands for CsPbBr3 NCs in optoelectronic applications.

Title: Generalized density functional theory framework for the non-linear density response of quantum many-body systems
Authors: Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Cheng Ma, Xuecheng Shao, Sebastian Schwalbe, Pontus Svensson, Panagiotis Tolias, Jan Vorberger, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: A density functional theory (DFT) framework is presented that links functional derivatives of free-energy functionals to non-linear static density response functions in quantum many-body systems. Within this framework, explicit expressions are derived for various higher-order response functions of systems that are homogeneous on average, including the first theoretical result for the cubic response at the first harmonic $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$. Specifically, our framework includes hitherto neglected mode-coupling effects that are important for the non-linear density response even in the presence of a single harmonic perturbation. We compare these predictions for $\chi_0^{(1,3)}(\vec{q})$ to new Kohn-Sham DFT simulations, leading to excellent agreement between theory and numerical results. Exact analytical expressions are also obtained for the long-wavelength limits of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions. Particular emphasis is placed on the connections between the third- and fourth-order functional derivatives of the non-interacting free-energy functional $F_s[n]$ and the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions of the uniform electron gas, respectively. These relations provide exact constraints that may prove useful for the future construction of improved approximations to $F_s[n]$, in particular for warm dense matter applications at finite temperatures. Here, we use this framework to assess several commonly employed approximations to $F_s[n]$ through orbital-free DFT simulations of the harmonically perturbed ideal electron gas. The results are compared with Kohn-Sham DFT calculations across temperatures ranging from the ground state to the warm dense regime. Additionally, we analyze in detail the temperature- and wavenumber-dependent non-monotonic behavior of the ideal quadratic and cubic response functions.

Title: On the Role of the Canonical Transformation in the Single-Channel Kondo Model
Authors: Zehra Özcan
Abstract: This pedagogical work presents the significant role that canonical transformation plays in the interpretation of the Abelian bosonized single-channel SU(2) Kondo model, emphasizing its effect on the scaling dimension $\Delta$. The transformation shifts the longitudinal exchange coupling and modifies the scaling dimension of the spin-flip vertex $\tau_{\pm} e^{\pm i\beta \phi}$. Rather than fixing $\Delta$ to the fermionic value $\tfrac{1}{2}$, we keep $\alpha$ explicit, which allows us to identify how different choices lead to marginal or relevant regimes through $(1-\Delta(\alpha))J_\perp$. This approach offers a direct way to trace the scaling behavior from the bosonized Hamiltonian and shows how the RG flow connects to the definition of the Kondo temperature, where the resistance diverges, without switching to other methods.

Title: First principle study of electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) full Heusler: Application to embedded automotive systems
Authors: N. Saidi, A. Abbad, W. Benstaali, K. Bahnes
Abstract: In this study, theoretical investigation on structural, electronic, magnetic, elastic and thermoelectric properties of the full Heusler Co$_2$YPb (Y = Tc, Ti, Zr and Hf) alloys have been performed within density functional theory (DFT). The exchange and correlation potential is addressed using two approximations: the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) and the GGA augmented by the Tran--Blaha-modified Becke-Johnson (mBj-GGA) approximation, which provides a more accurate description of the energy band gap. The electronic and magnetic properties reveal that the full-Heusler alloys Co$_2$YPb (with Y = Tc, Ti, Zr, and Hf) display half-metallic ferromagnetic behavior. Furthermore, the elastic properties suggest that Co$_2$YPb are mechanically stable, with ductile characteristics. Full Heusler alloys P-type exhibit positive Seebeck coefficients and high ZT values, indicating good thermoelectric performance in terms of electrical and thermal conductivity. This leads us to the conclusions that these compounds are very interesting in improving the performance of embedded automotive systems and can also be used in spintronic devices.

Authors: Mohammad Amini, Linghao Yan, Orlando J. Silveira, Adolfo O. Fumega, Viliam Vaňo, Jose L. Lado, Shawulienu Kezilebieke, Peter Liljeroth, and Robert Drost
Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures are a core tool in quantum material design. The recent addition of monolayer ferroelectrics expands the possibilities of designer materials. Ferroelectric domains can be manipulated using electric fields, thus opening a route for external control over material properties. In this paper we explore the possibility of engineering magneto-electric coupling in ferroelectric heterostructures by studying the interface of bilayer SnTe with iron phthalocyanine molecules as a model system. The molecules act as sensor spins, allowing us to sample the magneto-electric coupling with nanometer precision through scanning tunneling microscopy. Our measurements uncover a structural, and therefore material-independent and intrinsic, mechanism to couple electric and magnetic degrees of freedom at the nanoscale.

Title: Interplay of Kekulé bond order and lattice instability in $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$
Authors: Yuanhao Zhang, Zi Yuan, Xiangru Kong, Weijiang Gong, Shaozhi Li
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between charge order and lattice instability in quantum materials remains a central challenge, as their coexistence often obscures causal relationships. This work introduces $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a novel platform to investigate charge order mediated by two distinct mechanisms. We show that the hybridization between carbon $\pi$ and lithium $s$ orbitals generates an effective long-range hopping within Li-centered hexagons. This hopping drives a Kekulé bond order, whose structure varies with charge density and the sign of the hopping. This bond order induces a Kekulé lattice distortion via electron-phonon coupling. In the limit where lithium atoms are distant from the graphene layer, a Fermi surface nesting-driven Kekulé bond order emerges, stabilized by the electron-phonon interaction. Our results establish $\mathrm{C}_6\mathrm{Li}$ as a tunable platform for elucidating the causal hierarchy between electronic and structural orders in quantum materials.

Title: Quasiparticle spectra of mixtures of dipolar and non-dipolar condensates at zero and finite temperatures
Authors: Harsimranjit Kaur, Kuldeep Suthar
Abstract: We examine the low-lying collective quasiparticle modes of a quasi-one-dimensional mixture of Bose-Einstein condensates having dipolar and non-dipolar atomic species. The dipolar atomic species have permanent magnetic dipolar moments. We employ Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov theory to investigate the distinct collective spectra at zero and finite temperatures corresponding to phase separation phenomena stemming from the dipole-dipole interaction of dipolar atomic species. When the dipolar interaction is tuned to be repulsive, the number of zero-energy modes decreases, reflecting the system's tendency towards mixing. For a large number of atoms, we show that the attractive (repulsive) dipolar interaction strengths lead to ground states with non-dipolar (dipolar) atomic species at the periphery, and this leads to a discontinuity in quasiparticle mode evolution. We finally reveal that miscibility driven by thermal fluctuations at finite temperatures exhibits dipole mode hardening, confirmed by the loss of long-range phase coherence through the correlation function. The mode mixing in the dispersion relations ascertains a dipolar strength-dependent miscibility transition and the low-lying quasiparticle mode evolution.

Title: Valence band-satellite, temperature dependent magnetic and spectral study of α-Fe
Authors: Trishu Verma, Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K Pandey
Abstract: We investigate the influence of correlations and plasmonic excitation on valence band-satellite of $\alpha$-Fe, along with magnetic and spectral properties as function of temperature. Coulomb interaction parameters are obtained by systematically employing various schemes in constrained random phase approximation (cRPA). This study identifies the presence of valence band satellite in Fe at $\sim$6 eV binding energy supported by (i) substantial incoherent spectral weight in the valence band spectra obtained from Density Functional Theory plus Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DFT+DMFT) and (ii) plasmonic excitations in the frequency range $\sim$6-8 eV suggested by $G_0W_0$ calculations. We note presence of significant contribution of temperature-dependent Pauli-spin susceptibility indicating competing degree of itinerancy. $e_g$ state shows a strong temperature driven non-Fermi-liquid behavior emerging near $T_c$. Our results reveal a high-temperature orbital-selective loss of coherence eventually leads to a orbital selective collapse of magnetization at $T_c$, suggesting a ferromagnetic phase characterized by strong correlation- and temperature- dependent spectral features.

Title: Interlayer coupling driven phase evolution in hyperbolic $1T$-TaS$_2$

Abstract: Understanding how microscopic interactions control macroscopic phase transitions is central to quantum materials, where charge density waves (CDWs), Mott states, and superconductivity often compete. In $1T$-TaS$_2$, this competition is tied to a sequence of CDW phases and a hysteretic metal-insulator transition, but details of the transition, especially the role of interlayer coupling, remain unresolved. In this work, spectroscopic ellipsometry is used to determine the uniaxial dielectric response of bulk $1T$-TaS$_2$ from room temperature down to the commensurate insulating state. The room-temperature data reveal natural type-II hyperbolic behavior in the visible range, with negative in-plane and positive out-of-plane permittivity. Temperature-dependent ellipsometry combined with anisotropic Bruggeman effective medium analysis shows that the metallic domains responsible for percolation evolve from disc-like to needle-like shapes, and that, upon heating, an additional intermediate phase emerges. These results identify the transition in $1T$-TaS$_2$ as a three-dimensional, interlayer-driven percolation process and establish this material as a natural, tunable hyperbolic medium.

Title: Alteraxial Phonons in Collinear Magnets
Authors: Fuyi Wang, Junqi Xu, Xinqi Liu, Huaiqiang Wang, Lifa Zhang, Haijun Zhang
Abstract: Circularly polarized or axial phonons possessing nonzero angular momentum have attracted considerable interest. These phonons have finite magnetic moment and can couple to internal magnetic order. The rich magnetic structures enable phonon angular momentum (PAM) to acquire momentum-space textures analogous to electronic spin structures. However, a systematic framework for classifying these textures, especially their potential higher-order multipolar patterns, has remained elusive. Here, by employing magnetic point group analysis, we develop a complete classification of long-wavelength phonons in collinear magnets. Our theory distinguishes four fundamental types, including three families of magneto-axial phonons differentiated by symmetry and the parity (odd or even) of the PAM wave pattern. Strikingly, we reveal a full sequence of axial phonons exhibiting higher-order-wave (from p- to j-wave) PAM patterns covering both odd and even parities, which we term magneto-alteraxial phonons. Our high-throughput calculations predict hundreds of magnetic candidates hosting such magneto-alteraxial phonons. We have also performed ab initio calculations on representative materials to validate the proposed magneto-alteraxial phonon spectra and PAM patterns. Our work establishes a symmetry-guided design principle for axial phonons and related phenomena in magnetic materials.

Title: Separation of Hoke and Schottky effects for improvement of mixed halide perovskite solar cell stability
Authors: Vladimir Ivanov, Eduard Ageev, Denis Danilov, Eduard Danilovskiy, Dmitry Gets
Abstract: Ion migration in halide perovskites is a key factor limiting the operational stability of solar cells due to formation of halogen ion enriched domains and accumulation layers. The present work demonstrates the manifestation of ion migration in two ways via Hoke and Schottky effects. Both effects are induced by external exposure but have its peculiar way of solar cell performance degradation. We demonstrate the effects of ion migration on the device performance by measuring time dependent short-circuit current and different impedance characteristics that allow to see how charge-carrier separation property degrades. The Schottky effect leads to the rapid decrease of charge-carrier separation characteristic of solar cell while Hoke effect leads to the slow defect accumulation in the perovskite layer leading to the enhanced Shockley-Read-Hall recombination. Separation of these two effects can be realized by simple increase of transport layer thickness. A thick transport layer blocks losses of charge-carrier selectivity in a solar cell and leads to an enormous increase of T80 time, from 15 seconds up to 60 minutes.

Title: Static Dielectric Permittivity Profiles and Coarse-graining Approaches for Water in Graphene Slit Pores
Authors: Philipp Stärk, Henrik Stooß, Philip Loche, Douwe Jan Bonthuis, Roland R. Netz, Alexander Schlaich
Abstract: The dielectric response of nano-confined fluids is crucial across technologies and biological systems, yet its calculation and interpretation from molecular simulations are often muddled by unclear boundary conditions. We re-derive the Green--Kubo relation for the spatially resolved linear dielectric response of fluids in planar confinement, explicitly accounting for boundary conditions and showing that equilibrium-derived profiles agree with those obtained from external fields. We identify common misconceptions in the literature and outline how microscopic dielectric behavior can be coarse-grained to connect with experimental observables. Simulations show that water retains a bulk-like dielectric response down to $\sim 1\,\mathrm{nm}$ confinement. The reduced \emph{effective} dielectric response that governs capacitance arises from the placement of the dielectric interface. Using effective-medium theory, we demonstrate that long-range reductions reported in experiments and theory are consistent with bulk-like behavior beyond about $1\,\mathrm{nm}$ from the surface. The effective response naturally maps onto an interfacial capacitance, and the dielectric properties of simulated water are robust across simulation setups and water models, reflecting universal polarization correlations.

Title: Spin-Texture Spin-valve with a van der Waals Magnet
Authors: Bing Zhao, Roselle Ngaloy, Lars Sjöström, Saroj P. Dash
Abstract: All-electrical methods for nucleating, detecting, and manipulating spin textures in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets can serve as fundamental building blocks for multi-state spintronic memory, logic, and neuromorphic computing applications. Unlike conventional ferromagnets, vdW ferromagnets such as Fe5GeTe2 with strong Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions stabilize nanoscale chiral spin textures, including skyrmions and stripe domains. However, the sub-100 nm size of these spin textures has limited their study to sophisticated microscopy techniques. Here, we demonstrate all-electrical detection of spin textures in vdW itinerant ferromagnet Fe5GeTe2 using pure spin transport in a lateral graphene spin-valve device at room temperature. By engineering nanoscale constrictions or notches in Fe5GeTe2, we create spin textures that inject distinct spin polarizations into the graphene channel, where they are nonlocally sensed by a reference conventional ferromagnetic detector at room temperature. This enables the observation of anomalous multi-level spin-valve switching and Hanle spin precession signals, which are due to unique spin textures in Fe5GeTe2 and in sharp contrast to single-domains and conventional magnet-based devices. This all-electrical approach can provide direct access to the spin textures on an integrated 2D spintronic circuit without the need for ex-situ microscopic characterizations.

Title: Dynamic Screening Effects on Auger Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites
Authors: Utkarsh Singh, Sergei I. Simak
Abstract: The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\approx1.73$ eV) and $\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate.

Title: Critical Density-Wave Vestigial Phases of Commensurate Pair Density Wave
Authors: Chu-Tian Gao, Jing Zhou, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: The pair-density-wave (PDW) is an exotic pairing state hosting a spatially modulated pairing order parameter, which has attracted great interest. Due to its simultaneously breaking U(1)-gauge and translational symmetries, intriguing vestigial phases which restore only one broken symmetry can emerge at an intermediate temperature regime. Previously, investigations on the vestigial phases of PDW were mainly focused on incommensurate PDW. However, the experimentally observed PDW is usually commensurate, whose vestigial phases have not been systematically investigated. Here we study the vestigial phases of 2D commensurate PDW with $n$-times expanded unit vectors, hosting different numbers of wave vectors. Based on the Ginzburg-Landau theory, we get the low energy effective model Hamiltonian. Subsequent renormalization group (RG) and Monte-Carlo (MC) studies are conducted to obtain the phase diagram and spatial dependent correlation functions. Our RG and MC calculations consistently yield the following result. For $n\le 4$, besides the charge-4e/2e superconductivity, there exists the translational symmetry broken charge-density-wave (CDW) vetigial phase. Intriguingly, for $n\ge 5$, the restore of the translational symmetry with increasing temperature is realized through two successive Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Such a two-step process leads into two critical vestigial phases, i.e. the critical-PDW and the critical-CDW phases, in which the discrete translational symmetry is quasily broken, leading into a power-law decaying density-density correlation even at 2D. Our work appeals for experimental verifications.

Title: Mid-infrared intraband transitions in InAs colloidal quantum dots
Authors: Shraman Kumar Saha, Philippe Guyot-Sionnest
Abstract: III-V colloidal quantum dots are widely studied for their applications as detectors and emitters from visible to short-wave infrared. They might also be used in the mid-infrared if they can be stably n-doped to access their intraband transitions. Mid-infrared intraband transitions are therefore studied for InAs, InAs/InP, and InAs/ZnSe colloidal quantum dots with an energy gap at 1.4 micron. Using electrochemistry, the quantum dot films show state-resolved mobility, state-resolved electron filling, and intraband absorption in the 3-8 micron range. The InAs/ZnSe films need a more reducing potential than InAs, but the InAs/InP films need a lower reduction potential. As a result, we found that dry films of InAs/InP dots show stable n-doping of the 1Se state, with a steady-state intraband absorption in the 3-5 micron range, and intraband luminescence at 5 micron. low-toxicity, high thermal stability, and stable n-doping, InAs quantum dots become an interesting material for mid-infrared applications.

Title: Boundary Criticality of Complex Conformal Field Theory: A Case Study in the Non-Hermitian 5-State Potts Model
Authors: Yin Tang, Qianyu Liu, Qicheng Tang, W. Zhu
Abstract: Conformal fields with boundaries give rise to rich critical phenomena that can reveal information about the underlying conformality. While most existing studies focus on Hermitian systems, here we explore boundary critical phenomena in a non-Hermitian quantum 5-state Potts model which exhibits complex conformality in the bulk. We identify free, fixed and mixed conformal boundary conditions and observe the conformal tower structure of energy spectra, supporting the emergence of conformal boundary criticality. We also studied the duality relation between different conformal boundary conditions under the Kramers-Wannier transformation. These findings should facilitate a comprehensive understanding for complex CFTs and stimulate further exploration on the boundary critical phenomena within non-Hermitian strongly-correlated systems.

Title: Mesoscopic superfluid to superconductor transition
Authors: Yehoshua Winsten, Doron Cohen
Abstract: Spectrum tomography for the energy ($E$) of a ring-shaped Bose-Hubbard circuit is illustrated. There is an inter-particle interaction $U$ that controls superfluidity (SF) and the transition to the Mott Insulator (MI) regime. The circuit is coupled to an electromagnetic cavity mode of frequency $\omega_0$, and the coupling is characterized by a generalized fine-structure-constant $\alpha$ that controls the emergence of superconductivity (SC). The ${(U,\alpha,\omega_0,E)}$ diagram features SF and SC regions, a vast region of fragmented possibly chaotic states, and an MI regime for large $U$. The mesoscopic version of the Meissner effect and the Anderson-Higgs mechanism are discussed.

Title: Layer-Resolved Impurity States Reveal Competing Pairing Mechanisms in Trilayer Nickelate Superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Suyin Zheng, Tao Zhou
Abstract: Trilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate superconductor $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ has generated considerable interest due to its unconventional superconductivity and complex electronic structure. Notably, $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ features a mixed Ni valence state and an asymmetric trilayer configuration, leading to distinct quasiparticle distributions and local density of states (LDOS) between the inner and outer NiO$_2$ planes. In this work, we investigate impurity-induced states in $\mathrm{La}_4 \mathrm{Ni}_3 \mathrm{O}_{10}$ using a two-orbital model combined with $T$-matrix formalism, focusing on the contrasting roles of intra- and interlayer pairing channels. Our self-consistent mean-field analysis reveals that interlayer pairing results in partially gapless Fermi surfaces, with unpaired quasiparticles concentrated in the outer layers and a pronounced low-energy LDOS. We demonstrate that impurity effects vary significantly depending on both the pairing symmetry and impurity location: interlayer-dominant pairing produces sharp resonance states when impurities are in the inner layer, whereas impurities in the outer layer lead to in-gap enhancements without sharp resonances; in contrast, intralayer-dominant pairing generally yields increased in-gap LDOS without sharp impurity resonances, regardless of impurity position. These findings suggest that single-impurity spectroscopy can serve as a powerful probe to distinguish between competing superconducting pairing mechanisms in trilayer nickelates and highlight the rich physics arising from their multilayer structure.

Title: Computational Studies on O2-P2 Phase-Transition Dynamics in Layered-Oxide Sodium-Ion Cathode Materials
Authors: Konstantin Köster, Payam Kaghazchi
Abstract: Sodium-ion batteries have gained much interest over the past years and especially layered oxides are highly considered as cathodes for the next generation of batteries. However, there are still significant challenges to overcome in these materials for practical applications mainly related to capacity degradation and voltage fading. A key influence factor for these challenges are phase transitions that occur by gliding of layers during operation of these materials. Until now there is limited atomistic-level understanding on such transitions as simulations of these processes are computationally demanding. In this work, we trained a classical pairwise Coulomb-Buckingham potential versus extensive \textit{ab initio} data using a genetic algorithm to study O2-P2 phase transitions in Na\textsubscript{\textit{x}}CoO\textsubscript{2}. Our density functional theory~(DFT) and classical potential calculations show that phase transition barriers decrease upon desodiation and are further lowered if dynamic conditions are considered through molecular dynamics simulations. Our developed classical potential is able to capture phase transitions and its related increase in the Na-ion diffusivity under standard lab conditions at the $\upmu$s timescale of molecular dynamics simulation. Furthermore, it is found that the phase transition occurs gradually \textit{via} various OP\textit{n} phases.

Title: Robustness of flat band superconductivity against disorder in a two-dimensional Lieb lattice model
Authors: Georges Bouzerar, Maxime Thumin
Abstract: Recently, the possibility of high-temperature superconductivity (SC) in flat-band (FB) systems has been the focus of a great deal of activity. This study reveals that unlike conventional intra-band SC for which disorder has a dramatic impact, that associated with FBs is surprisingly robust to disorder-induced fluctuations and quasi-particle localization. In particular, for weak off-diagonal disorder, the critical temperature decreases linearly with disorder amplitude for conventional SC, whereas it is only quadratic in the case of SC in FBs. Our findings could have a major impact on the research and development of new compounds whose high purity will no longer be a critical barrier to their synthesis.

Title: Geometric Characterization of Anisotropic Correlations via Mutual Information Tomography
Authors: Beau Leighton-Trudel
Abstract: Characterizing anisotropic correlations in quantum and statistical systems requires a coordinate-invariant framework. We introduce a geometric map based on the local informational line element, calibrated by the Euclidean benchmark scale $C_{\mathrm{vac}}$: $ds^{2} = C_{\mathrm{vac}}/I(x,x+\epsilon)$. We prove that this map yields a smooth Riemannian structure $g_{ij}$ if and only if the short-distance mutual information (MI) follows the anisotropic inverse-quadratic law (local exponent $X_{\text{loc}}=2$). A key insight is that anisotropy is necessary to activate tensor geometry; isotropic MI forces conformal flatness $g_{ij} \propto \delta_{ij}$, suppressing shear degrees of freedom. We employ a parameterization-invariant unimodular split $g_{ij} = V^{2/D}\gamma_{ij}$, which rigorously separates local density fluctuations (volume $V$) from directional anisotropy (shape/shear $\gamma_{ij}$). We introduce ``MI Tomography,'' an operational protocol to reconstruct these geometric components from finite directional measurements. The protocol is validated using the equal-time ground state of an anisotropic 2D quantum harmonic lattice (massless relativistic scalar) on a torus, where the reconstructed shape tensor $\gamma_{ij}$ quantitatively recovers the physical coupling anisotropy. We work strictly in the local, fixed-coarse-graining $X_{\text{loc}}=2$ branch; the line element is used solely to extract the local kinematic structure (the local metric tensor), deferring global distance claims.

Title: Network of localized magnetic textures revealed using a saddle-point search framework
Authors: Hendrik Schrautzer, Tim Drevelow, Hannes Jónsson, Pavel F. Bessarab
Abstract: A computational framework is presented for the sampling of the energy surface of magnetic systems via the systematic identification of first-order saddle points that determine connectivity of metastable states and define the mechanisms of transitions between them. The framework combines four stages: first, the symmetry of a given minimum-energy configuration is identified and used to define subsystems whose eigenmodes provide relevant deformation directions; the subsystem eigenmodes are then used to guide the system toward the vicinity of different saddle points surrounding the energy minimum; next, the geodesic minimum mode following method is employed to efficiently converge onto the saddle points; and finally, the identified saddle points are embedded into the state network. Applied to metastable textures in two-dimensional chiral magnets described by a lattice Hamiltonian, the method reveals a hierarchy of transition mechanisms governing the nucleation, annihilation, and rearrangement of the fundamental components of localized magnetic textures. The identified saddle points enable the construction of the network of metastable states, where saddle points define the connectivity between them, providing a comprehensive map of accessible transitions and their associated energy barriers. Transitions corresponding to both homotopies that preserve the topological charge and transformations that change it are identified. By scaling the interaction parameters, the distinct behavior of these two classes is obtained as the continuum limit is approached. Finally, it is shown that textures with the same topological charge are not always connected by a homotopy corresponding to a minimum-energy path: in specific parameter regimes, the total topological charge necessarily increases and then decreases (or vice versa) during the transition, returning to its initial value at the final state.

Title: Multicomponent condensates: a flexible platform for soliton physics
Authors: Franco Rabec, Jérôme Beugnon, Jean Dalibard, Sylvain Nascimbene
Abstract: We present a series of experimental investigations on binary mixtures of Bose-Einstein condensates. Our focus lies on the regime where the interaction parameters place the system at the threshold of miscibility. We demonstrate that the dynamics of such mixtures can be effectively reduced to a single nonlinear equation. This framework is illustrated through the discussion of stable solitonic solutions in one and two dimensions. Furthermore, we show that employing a binary mixture enables exploration beyond the dynamics governed by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, allowing us to address other fundamental equations in nonlinear physics, such as the Landau-Lifshitz equation describing the motion of spin chains in ferromagnetic materials.

Title: Extreme Strain Controlled Correlated Metal-Insulator Transition in the Altermagnet CrSb
Authors: Cong Li, Mengli Hu, Jianfeng Zhang, Magnus H. Berntsen, Francesco Scali, Dibya Phuyal, Chun Lin, Wanyu Chen, Johan Chang, Oliver J. Clark, Timur K. Kim, Jacek Osiecki, Craig Polley, Balasubramanian Thiagarajan, Zhilin Li, Tao Xiang, Oscar Tjernberg
Abstract: Correlated flat bands and altermagnetism are two important directions in quantum materials, centred respectively on interaction-dominated phases and symmetry-enforced spin-textured states, yet both derive from lattice symmetry and orbital hybridization. This common origin implies that extreme crystal distortion, by narrowing bandwidths, enhancing correlations and reshaping the symmetries of altermagnetic spin splittings, could unify flat-band and altermagnetic physics in a single material; in practice, however, achieving such large distortions in a crystalline altermagnet is a formidable challenge. Here we combine a dedicated strain device with a tailored single-crystal mounting scheme to impose a highly tensile strain gradient in bulk CrSb, a prototypical altermagnet, creating a near-surface layer in which the in-plane lattice is strongly distorted relative to the weakly strained bulk, while the average bulk distortion remains small. Angle-resolved photoemission reveals a reversible regime at moderate strain, where a deeper flat-band feature, attributed to a strain-gradient-driven suppression of Cr-Sb hybridization, coexists with a correlation-enhanced Cr 3d flat band, and an irreversible regime at larger strain where partial bond decoupling drives a predominantly insulating spectral response. Density-functional calculations show that an orbital-selective altermagnetic spin texture persists across this correlated regime despite strong bandwidth renormalisation. These results define a strain-symmetry-correlation map for CrSb and establish extreme tensile strain as a route to co-engineer flat-band tendencies and spin-textured, zero-net-moment correlated states in altermagnets, pointing toward strain-adaptive, spin-selective Mott filtering and related device concepts.

Title: Index-theoretic route to the subgap Andreev bands and topological response in Josephson junctions
Authors: Sinchan Ghosh, Srinjoy Ghosh, Arijit Kundu, K. Sengupta
Abstract: We demonstrate that the subgap Andreev bound states in a transparent Josephson junction, comprising of either chiral or non-chiral superconductors, can be viewed as a consequence of the index theorem in supersymmetric quantum mechanics. We provide an exact solution for these states starting from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes (BdG) equations describing quasiparticles in such junctions. We demonstrate that the dispersion of these subgap states depends only on the asymptotic properties of the pair-potential and not on its local spatial variation. Our study reveals the crucial distinction between junctions of non-chiral $p$-wave superconductors and those of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors by analyzing the wavefunction of their subgap bound states. We find a stable topological response leading to the well-known $4\pi$ periodic Josephson effect protected against weak disorder potential for the non-chiral $p$-wave junctions; no such protection is found for junctions of $s$-wave or chiral superconductors. We supplement our analytic results with numerical computation of the Josephson currents in such junctions using exact numerical Green functions and starting from a lattice model of an itinerant altermagnet which is expected to host triplet $p$-wave superconductivity with equal-spin-pairing. We also discuss the implications of our results for Josephson junctions away from the transparent limit.

Title: Magnonics of time-varying media: Giant amplification via phase-transition-driven temporal interfaces
Authors: Krzysztof Sobucki, Pawel Gruszecki
Abstract: Gilbert damping-the primary obstacle limiting spin-wave propagation in magnonic devices-can be transformed from an adversary into an asset. Here we demonstrate 175-fold spin-wave amplitude amplification in ultrathin films with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy at temporal interfaces associated with a field-driven transition between a uniform in-plane state and a stripe-domain state, exceeding existing parametric and spin-torque schemes (10-50-fold) without a continuous power supply. When the in-plane bias field is swept through a critical value in the presence of finite Gilbert damping, the spin-wave dispersion undergoes dramatic softening, and the eigenfrequency crosses zero and acquires a positive imaginary part that drives exponential growth. We identify this as a damping-induced instability operating near an exceptional point-a non-Hermitian degeneracy where, counterintuitively, increased Gilbert damping enhances amplification. This mechanism exploits ingredients specific to these magnetic films: the interplay of Gilbert damping, Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-interaction-induced nonreciprocity, and field-driven phase transitions-a combination that, to our knowledge, has no direct counterpart in photonic or acoustic time-varying platforms. Our analytical framework provides explicit design rules, while micromagnetic simulations capture the full nonlinear dynamics, including stripe-domain formation. This work establishes temporal magnonics as a new paradigm for reconfigurable, lithography-free spin-wave control.

Title: Bimorph Lithium Niobate Piezoelectric Micromachined Ultrasonic Transducers
Authors: Vakhtang Chulukhadze, Zihuan Liu, Ziqian Yao, Lezli Matto, Tzu-Hsuan Hsu, Nishanth Ravi, Xiaoyu Niu, Michael E. Liao, Mark S. Goorsky, Neal Hall, Ruochen Lu
Abstract: Piezoelectric micromachined ultrasonic transducers (PMUTs) are widely used in applications that demand mechanical resilience, thermal stability, and compact form factors. Lead zirconate titanate (PZT) and aluminum nitride (AlN) active layers are used in PMUTs to enable acoustic actuation, sensing, or bidirectional operation. These platforms rely on bimorph films to maximize electromechanical coupling ($k^2$) through thin-film deposition, which uses intermediate electrode layers to establish opposing electric fields. Consequently, incumbent PMUT platforms are limited in achievable film thickness and feature material interfaces that compromise mechanical integrity and thermal performance. Combined with the intrinsic limitations of PZT and AlN, these factors motivate exploration of alternative PMUT material platforms. Recent efforts have sought to demonstrate that single-crystal lithium niobate (LN) is a promising candidate, offering substantially higher $k^2$ and bidirectional performance. Advances in LN film transfer technology have enabled the formation of periodically poled piezoelectric (P3F) LN, facilitating a bimorph stack without intermediate electrodes. In this work, we showcase bimorph PMUTs incorporating a mechanically robust, 20 micron thick P3F LN active layer. We establish the motivation for LN PMUTs through a material comparison, followed by extensive membrane geometry optimization and subsequent enhancement of the PMUT's $k^2$. We demonstrate a 775 kHz flexural mode device with a quality factor (Q) of 200 and an extracted $k^2$ of 6.4%, yielding a high transmit efficiency of 65 nm/V with a mechanically robust active layer. We leverage the high performance to demonstrate extreme-temperature resilience, showcasing stable device operation up to 600 degrees C and survival up to 900 degrees C, highlighting LN's potential as a resilient PMUT platform.

Title: Strong zero modes in integrable spin-S chains
Authors: Fabian H.L. Essler, Paul Fendley, Eric Vernier
Abstract: We derive exact strong zero mode (ESZM) operators for integrable spin-S chains with open boundary conditions and a boundary field. Their locality properties are generally weaker than in the previously known cases, but they still imply infinite coherence times in the vicinity of the edges. We explain how such integrable chains possess multiple ground states describing a first-order quantum phase transition, and that the odd number of such states for integer S makes the weaker locality properties necessary. We make contact with more traditional approaches by showing how the ESZM for S=1/2 acts on energy eigenstates given by solutions of the Bethe equations.

Title: Anomalous coarsening and nonlinear diffusion of kinks in an one-dimensional quasi-classical Holstein model
Authors: Ho Jang, Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We study the phase-ordering dynamics of a quasi-classical Holstein model. At half-filling, the zero-temperature ground state is a commensurate charge-density-wave (CDW) with alternating occupied and empty sites. This quasi-classical formulation enables us to isolate the role of electrons in coarsening dynamics. Following a thermal quench, CDW domains grow through the diffusion and annihilation of kinks -- topological defects separating the two symmetry-related CDW orders. While standard diffusive dynamics predicts domain sizes scaling as the square root of time, our large-scale simulations reveal a slower power-law growth with a temperature-dependent exponent. We trace this anomalous behavior to a cooperative kink hopping arising from Fermi-Dirac statistics of electrons and quasi-conservation of electron numbers. The correlated-hopping of kinks in turn gives rise to an effective diffusion coefficient that depends on the kink density. These results uncover a new mechanism for slow coarsening and carry implications for phase-ordering in the full Holstein model and related electron-phonon systems.

Title: Thermal ionization of impurity-bound quasiholes in the fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Ke Huang, Sankar Das Sarma, Xiao Li
Abstract: We study the interplay between a Coulomb impurity and quasiholes in a fractional quantum Hall (FQH) state at finite temperatures. While a repulsive impurity can pin a quasihole and stabilize the FQH state, an attractive impurity cannot bind quasiholes. We demonstrate that at finite temperatures, a quasihole can be thermally ionized from a repulsive impurity, resulting in an ionization phase transition. We propose an experimental setup using exciton sensing to detect such a thermal ionization of quasiholes.

Title: Universal bounds on entropy production from fluctuating coarse-grained trajectories
Authors: Udo Seifert
Abstract: Entropy production is arguably the most universally applicable measure of non-equilibrium behavior, particularly for systems coupled to a heat bath. This setting encompasses driven soft matter as well as biomolecular, biochemical, and biophysical systems. Despite its central role, direct measurements of entropy production remain challenging - especially in small systems dominated by fluctuations. The main difficulty arises because not all degrees of freedom contributing to entropy production are experimentally accessible. A key question, therefore, is how to infer entropy production from coarse-grained observations, such as time series of experimentally measurable variables. Over the past decade, stochastic thermodynamics has provided several inequalities that yield model-free lower bounds on entropy production from such coarse-grained data. The major approaches rely on observations of coarse-grained states, fluctuating currents or ticks, correlation functions of coarse-grained observables, and waiting-time distributions between so-called Markovian events, which correspond to transitions between mesoscopic states. Here, we systematically review these techniques valid under the sole assumption of a Markovian, i.e., memoryless, dynamics on an underlying, not necessarily observable, network of states or following a possibly high-dimensional Langevin equation. We discuss in detail the large class of non-equilibrium steady states and highlight extensions of these methods to time-dependent and relaxing systems. While our focus is on mean entropy production, we also summarize recent progress in quantifying entropy production along individual coarse-grained trajectories.

Title: A dynamical order parameter for the transition to nonergodic dynamics in the discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Andrew Kalish, Pedro Fittipaldi de Castro, Wladimir A. Benalcazar
Abstract: The discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation (DNLSE) exhibits a transition from ergodic, delocalized dynamics to a weakly nonergodic regime characterized by breather formation; yet, a precise characterization of this transition has remained elusive. By sampling many microcanonically equivalent initial conditions, we identify the asymptotic ensemble variance of the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy as a dynamical order parameter that vanishes in the ergodic phase and becomes finite once ergodicity is broken. The relaxation time governing the ensemble convergence of the KS entropy displays an essential singularity at the transition, yielding a sharp boundary between the two dynamical regimes. This framework provides a trajectory-independent method for detecting ergodicity breaking that is broadly applicable to nonlinear lattice systems with conserved quantities.

Title: Performance Benchmarking of Tensor Trains for accelerated Quantum-Inspired Homogenization on TPU, GPU and CPU architectures
Authors: Sascha H. Hauck, Matthias Kabel, Nicolas R. Gauger
Abstract: Recent advances in high-resolution CT-imaging technology are creating a new class of ultra-high resolved micro-structural datasets that challenge the limits of traditional homogenization approaches. While state-of-the-art FFT-based homogenization techniques remain effective for moderate datasets, their memory footprint and computational cost grow rapidly with increasing resolution, making them increasingly inefficient for industrial-scale problems. To address these challenges, the recently developed Superfast-Fourier Transform (SFFT)-based homogenization algorithm leverages the memory-efficient low-rank representations of Tensor Trains (TTs), which reduce the storage and computational requirements of large-scale homogenization problems. Developed for CPU usage, SFFT-based Homogenization efficiently handles high-resolution datasets, assuming the underlying data is well-behaved. In this work, we investigate the performance of fundamental TT operations on modern hardware accelerators using the JAX framework. This benchmarking study, comparing CPUs, GPUs, and TPUs, evaluates execution times and computational efficiency. Building on these insights, we adapt the SFFT-based homogenization algorithm for usage on accelerators, achieving speed-ups of up to 10x relative to the CPU implementation, thus paving the road for the treatment of previously infeasible dataset sizes. Our results show that GPUs and TPUs achieve comparable performance in realistic scenarios, despite the relative immaturity of the TPU ecosystem, demonstrating the potential of both architectures to accelerate quantum-inspired techniques for industrial-scale simulations, particularly for homogenization problems.

Title: Intralayer antiferromagnetism in two-dimensional van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$
Authors: Neesha Yadav, Shivani Kumawat, Sandeep, Brajesh Kumar Mani, Pintu Das
Abstract: For the van der Waals magnet Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$, although a ferromagnetic ground state has been reported, there are also reports of complex magnetic behavior suggesting coexistence of ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism due to the intricate interaction between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ ions in this system. The exact nature of the interactions and the origin of antiferromagnetism are still under debate. Here, we report the observation of signature of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic couplings between different Fe-ions in the anomalous Hall effect measured for devices of mechanically exfoliated Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ nano-flakes of thicknesses ranging from\,$\sim$\,15-20 layers. The temperature-dependent anomalous Hall effect data reveal two sharp step-like switchings at low temperature ($T\lesssim150\,$K). Our detailed analyses suggest the step-like sharp switchings in anomalous Hall resistance are due to the magnetization reversal behavior of different Fe-ions in individual layers of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$. The experimental results can be explained by considering an intra-layer antiferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+3}$ ions, whereas intra-layer ferromagnetic coupling between Fe$^{+3}$ and Fe$^{+2}$ in the system. Our experimental results and the analyses are supported by the first-principles calculations for energetics and intralayer as well as interlayer exchange coupling constants.

Title: Functional Renormalization Group flows as diffusive Hamilton-Jacobi-type equations
Authors: Adrian Koenigstein, Martin J. Steil, Stefan Floerchinger
Abstract: In this work, we suggest to identify the Functional Renormalization Group flow equations of two-point functions as Hamilton-Jacobi(-Bellman)-type partial differential equations. This reformulation and reinterpretation goes beyond recent developments that treat Renormalization Group flow equations as conservation laws in field space and also allows to systematically understand and handle the nonconservative contributions in flow equations numerically. We demonstrate this novel approach by first applying it to a simple fermion-boson system in zero spacetime dimensions - which itself presents as an interesting playground for method development. Afterwards, we show, how the gained insights can be transferred to more realistic systems: One is the bosonic $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetric model in three Euclidean dimensions within a truncation that involves the field-dependent effective potential and field-dependent wave-function renormalization. The other example is the $(1 + 1)$-dimensional Gross-Neveu model within a truncation that involves a field-dependent potential and a field-dependent fermion mass/Yukawa coupling at nonzero temperature, chemical potential, and finite fermion number.

Title: Detuning-insensitive wide-field imaging of vector microwave fields with diamond sensors
Authors: Xiu-Qi Chen, Rui-Zhi Zhang, Gang-Qin Liu, Huijie Zheng
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond have precipitated profound advances in microwave detection, manifesting themselves both in spatial resolution and sensitivity. However, typical methods based on Rabi oscillations are subject to detunings due to thermal and magnetic fluctuations and/or gradients, which introduce systematic errors and render the measurements susceptible to environmental perturbations. Here, we propose and demonstrate a novel approach for determining both the magnitude and direction of microwaves, by exploiting the spectral line broadening effect in the optically detected magnetic resonance of NV centers. This method eliminates the requirement of aligning the MW frequency to the spin transitions and is therefore immune to variations and inhomogeneities of the magnetic field and temperature, providing an optimal tool for fast imaging applications. With this method, we achieved wide-field imaging of near field microwaves generated with a microscale $\rm{\Omega}$-pattern antenna with a resolution of 800\,nm. Combining with the vector detection using multi-axis NVs, a full reconstruction of the vector microwave fields is obtained. Besides, our scheme also exhibits excellent linearity over a broad range of MW amplitudes, and the scale is theoretically calculated to be more than four orders. Our results augment the applicability of diamond-based microwave devices in applications under complex scenarios, especially where large dynamic range, fast test speed, and high spatial resolution are demanded.

Title: A self-driving lab for solution-processed electrochromic thin films
Authors: Selma Dahms, Luca Torresi, Shahbaz Tareq Bandesha, Jan Hansmann, Holger Röhm, Alexander Colsmann, Marco Schott, Pascal Friederich
Abstract: Solution-processed electrochromic materials offer high potential for energy-efficient smart windows and displays. Their performance varies with material choice and processing conditions. Electrochromic thin film electrodes require a smooth, defect-free coating for optimal contrast between bleached and colored states. The complexity of optimizing the spin-coated electrochromic thin layer poses challenges for rapid development. This study demonstrates the use of self-driving laboratories to accelerate the development of electrochromic coatings by coupling automation with machine learning. Our system combines automated data acquisition, image processing, spectral analysis, and Bayesian optimization to explore processing parameters efficiently. This approach not only increases throughput but also enables a pointed search for optimal processing parameters. The approach can be applied to various solution-processed materials, highlighting the potential of self-driving labs in enhancing materials discovery and process optimization.

Title: Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics
Authors: Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti
Abstract: The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.

Title: Tunable Narrowband Terahertz Radiation from van der Waals Ferroelectrics
Authors: Chun-Ying Huang, Taketo Handa, Daniel G. Chica, Zhihao Cui, Ding Xu, Jeongheon Choe, Yiliu Li, Margalit L. Feuer, Milan E. Delor, Michael Fechner, David R. Reichman, Xavier Roy, Xiaoyang Zhu
Abstract: The terahertz (THz) spectral range is central to high-speed communication, precision metrology, sensing technologies, and a range of fundamental scientific investigations. Achieving these capabilities in practical systems increasingly demands chip-scale integration of THz photonic components that are typically bulky. In this context, van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a unique platform for integrated nonlinear photonics in the visible and near-infrared regimes, and extending this framework into the THz domain would constitute a significant advance. Here, we report tunable, intense, and narrowband THz radiation from ferroelectric niobium oxyhalides. Through halogen substitution and alloying, we achieve continuous and precise control over the emission frequency from 3.1 to 5.8 THz. We show that the narrowband THz radiation is driven by phonons associated with the ferroelectric polarization. We further demonstrate dynamic and nonvolatile control of the polarity of the coherent THz wave with external electric field. This work demonstrates efficient narrowband THz emission from vdW ferroeletrics and provides microscopic insight into its origin, paving the way for on-chip THz technology for a broad range of applications.

Title: Enhanced nuclear fusion in the sub-keV energy regime
Authors: Micah. E. Karahadian, Matthew Colborne, Arun Persaud, Thomas Schenkel, Jeremy N. Munday
Abstract: Nuclear fusion requires overcoming or traversing a repulsive Coulomb barrier of hundreds of kiloelectronvolts, rendering the probability of fusion at sub-keV energies vanishingly small. Yet in condensed matter, the electronic and structural environment of reacting nuclei can profoundly alter fusion rates. Here we demonstrate that deuterium-deuterium fusion within metallic foils exhibits a pronounced enhancement and reaction yield plateau below energies of 2.5 keV- contrary to the expected exponential suppression with decreasing energy. Using a dual-chamber platform that combines electrochemical deuterium loading with ion-beam bombardment, we show that fusion yields in palladium and titanium hydrides are enhanced by over 10^18 compared to theoretical bare-nucleus fusion rates. These results demonstrate that access to low-energy fusion processes can be governed by materials degrees of freedom. This materials-driven fusion regime establishes a reproducible, tunable framework for studying and ultimately engineering nuclear reactions in solids. While the reaction rates reported here are low, these insights into materials-modulated fusion processes offer a potential foundation for understanding how condensed-matter environments could influence future fusion-energy concepts.

Title: Maximally Symmetric Boost-Invariant Solutions of the Boltzmann Equation in Foliated Geometries
Authors: Mauricio Martinez, Christopher Plumberg
Abstract: In this work we study the relativistic kinetic theory of a boost-invariant conformal gas on a static, maximally symmetric background $dS_3\times \mathbb{R}$, considering all constant-curvature slicings of $dS_3$ - flat, spherical, or hyperbolic- and their associated symmetry groups. Using a symmetry-driven cotangent-bundle approach, we show that the isometry group of each slicing acts on phase space in such a way that only its Casimir invariants and the time-like coordinate unconstrained, so the distribution function depends solely on these quantities. This yields a unified boost-invariant exact solution of the Boltzmann equation valid for each constant-curvature foliation of \ds. Specializing this general solution to the flat and spherical foliations reproduces the Bjorken and Gubser flows, respectively, while its restriction to the hyperbolic foliation produces a genuinely new analytic solution (`Grozdanov flow'). Hydrodynamics and free streaming emerge naturally as limiting regimes of this novel exact solution. We further comment on several relevant aspects of the new boost-invariant solution on the hyperbolic slicing and on their interpretation once mapped back to Minkowski space.

Title: Entropic Confinement and Mode Connectivity in Overparameterized Neural Networks
Authors: Luca Di Carlo, Chase Goddard, David J. Schwab
Abstract: Modern neural networks exhibit a striking property: basins of attraction in the loss landscape are often connected by low-loss paths, yet optimization dynamics generally remain confined to a single convex basin and rarely explore intermediate points. We resolve this paradox by identifying entropic barriers arising from the interplay between curvature variations along these paths and noise in optimization dynamics. Empirically, we find that curvature systematically rises away from minima, producing effective forces that bias noisy dynamics back toward the endpoints - even when the loss remains nearly flat. These barriers persist longer than energetic barriers, shaping the late-time localization of solutions in parameter space. Our results highlight the role of curvature-induced entropic forces in governing both connectivity and confinement in deep learning landscapes.

Title: Mitigating the Transition of SiV$^-$ in Diamond to an Optically Dark State
Authors: Manuel Rieger, Rubek Poudel, Tobias Waldmann, Lina M. Todenhagen, Stefan Kresta, Nori N. Chavira Leal, Viviana Villafañe, Martin S. Brandt, Kai Müller, Jonathan J. Finley
Abstract: Negatively charged silicon vacancy centers in diamond (SiV$^-$) are promising for quantum photonic technologies. However, when subject to resonant optical excitation, they can inadvertently transfer into a zero-spin optically dark state. We show that this unwanted change of charge state can be quickly reversed by the resonant laser itself in combination with static electric fields. By defining interdigitated metallic contacts on the diamond surface, we increase the steady-state SiV$^-$ photoluminescence under resonant excitation by a factor $\ge3$ for most emitters, making it practically constant for certain individual emitters. We electrically activate single \sivs near the positively biased electrode, which are entirely dark without applying local electric fields. Using time-resolved 3-color experiments, we show that the resonant laser not only excites the SiV$^-$, but also creates free holes that convert SiV$^{2-}$ to SiV$^-$ on a timescale of milliseconds. Through analysis of several individual emitters, our results show that the degree of electrical charge state controllability differs between individual emitters, indicating that their local environment plays a key role. Our proposed electric-field-based stabilization scheme enhances deterministic charge state control in group-IV color centers and improves its understanding, offering a scalable path toward quantum applications such as entanglement generation and quantum key distribution.

Title: GENIUS: An Agentic AI Framework for Autonomous Design and Execution of Simulation Protocols
Authors: Mohammad Soleymanibrojeni, Roland Aydin, Diego Guedes-Sobrinho, Alexandre C. Dias, Maurício J. Piotrowski, Wolfgang Wenzel, Celso Ricardo Caldeira Rêgo
Abstract: Predictive atomistic simulations have propelled materials discovery, yet routine setup and debugging still demand computer specialists. This know-how gap limits Integrated Computational Materials Engineering (ICME), where state-of-the-art codes exist but remain cumbersome for non-experts. We address this bottleneck with GENIUS, an AI-agentic workflow that fuses a smart Quantum ESPRESSO knowledge graph with a tiered hierarchy of large language models supervised by a finite-state error-recovery machine. Here we show that GENIUS translates free-form human-generated prompts into validated input files that run to completion on $\approx$80% of 295 diverse benchmarks, where 76% are autonomously repaired, with success decaying exponentially to a 7% baseline. Compared with LLM-only baselines, GENIUS halves inference costs and virtually eliminates hallucinations. The framework democratizes electronic-structure DFT simulations by intelligently automating protocol generation, validation, and repair, opening large-scale screening and accelerating ICME design loops across academia and industry worldwide.

Title: Giant optical anisotropy and visible-frequency epsilon-near-zero in hyperbolic van der Waals MoOCl2

Abstract: The realization of extreme optical anisotropy is foundational to nanoscale light manipulation. Van der Waals (vdW) crystal MoOCl2 has emerged as a promising candidate for this quest, hosting hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in the visible and near-infrared wavelengths. However, the fundamental anisotropic dielectric tensor governing this behavior has remained elusive. Here, we resolve this problem by providing the first experimental determination of the full dielectric tensor of hyperbolic vdW MoOCl2. Via spectroscopic ellipsometry, Mueller matrix, and reflectance measurements, we quantify the material's optical duality: a metallic optical response ({\epsilon}_1 < 0) along the crystallographic a-axis and a dielectric response ({\epsilon}_1 > 0) along the orthogonal directions. This dichotomy drives an epsilon-near-zero (ENZ) condition at \approx 512 nm and results in giant in-plane birefringence of \delta n \approx 2.2 for MoOCl2. As a result, our work provides the critical missing experimental parameters for MoOCl2, establishing it as a benchmark hyperbolic and ENZ material.

Title: Hierarchical geometric deep learning enables scalable analysis of molecular dynamics
Authors: Zihan Pengmei, Spencer C. Guo, Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Aaron R. Dinner
Abstract: Molecular dynamics simulations can generate atomically detailed trajectories of complex systems, but analyzing these dynamics can be challenging when systems lack well-established quantitative descriptors (features). Graph neural networks (GNNs) in which messages are passed between nodes that represent atoms that are spatial neighbors promise to obviate manual feature engineering, but the use of GNNs with biomolecular systems of more than a few hundred residues has been limited in the context of analyzing dynamics by both difficulties in capturing the details of long-range interactions with message passing and the memory and runtime requirements associated with large graphs. Here, we show how local information can be aggregated to reduce memory and runtime requirements without sacrificing atomic detail. We demonstrate that this approach opens the door to analyzing simulations of protein-nucleic acid complexes with thousands of residues on single GPUs within minutes. For systems with hundreds of residues, for which there are sufficient data to make quantitative comparisons, we show that the approach improves performance and interpretability.

Title: Concentration Matters: Enhancing Particle Settling in Narrow Tilted Channels
Authors: Dipankar Kundu, Florencio Balboa Usabiaga, Adolfo Vázquez-Quesada, Marco Ellero
Abstract: Particles are known to sediment faster in containers with tilted walls than in vertical ones, a phenomenon known as the Boycott effect. In this work, we investigate how the tilt angle influences sedimentation in narrow channels across different particle volume fractions. Using particle-resolved computational fluid dynamics simulations, we reveal that there exists a concentration-dependent optimal tilt angle that maximizes sedimentation rates. Furthermore, at large tilt angles, the flow profiles across the channel deviate from the classical parabolic shape. We show that these non-parabolic profiles can be accurately captured by a one-dimensional Brinkman model, providing a predictive framework for understanding and tuning sedimentation in tilted geometries. Our findings demonstrate the potential to control and optimize particle settling by adjusting the channel tilt according to particle concentration, opening new possibilities for design in industrial and laboratory processes.

Title: Interplay between Standard Quantum Detailed Balance and Thermodynamically Consistent Entropy Production
Authors: Xin-Hai Tong, Kohei Yoshimura, Tan Van Vu, Naruo Ohga
Abstract: We demonstrate that if a quantum Markovian semigroup satisfies the standard quantum detailed balance condition, its generator admits a special representation that yields a vanishing entropy production rate. Conversely, if the generator admits a special representation adhering to the condition of thermodynamic consistency and leading to a vanishing entropy production rate, then the corresponding quantum Markovian semigroup must satisfy the standard quantum detailed balance condition. In this context, we adopt the definition of entropy production rate that is motivated by the physics literature and standard for thermodynamically consistent Lindbladians.

Title: Witnessing Spin-Orbital Entanglement using Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Scattering
Authors: Zecheng Shen, Shuhan Ding, Zijun Zhao, Francesco A. Evangelista, Yao Wang
Abstract: Entanglement plays a central role in quantum technologies, yet its characterization and control in materials remain challenging. Recent developments in spectrum-based entanglement witnesses have enabled new strategies for quantifying many-body entanglement in macroscopic materials. Here, we develop a protocol for detecting spin--orbital entanglement using experiment-accessible resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS). Central to our approach is the construction of a Hermitian generator from experimentally measurable spectra, which allows us to compute the quantum Fisher information (QFI) available in spin--orbital systems. The resulting QFI provides upper bounds for $k$-producible states and thus serves as a robust witness of spin--orbital entanglement. To account for realistic experimental limitations, we further extend our framework to include relaxed QFI bounds applicable to measurements lacking full polarization resolution.

Title: A Machine Learning study of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice
Authors: Shang-Wei Li, Kai-Wei Huang, Chien-Ting Chen, Fu-Jiun Jiang
Abstract: The critical phenomena of two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4,5$ and 6 are investigated using the technique of supervised neural network (NN). Unlike the conventional NN approaches, here we train a multilayer perceptron consisting of only one input layer, one hidden layer, and one output layer with two artificially made stagger-like configurations. Remarkably, despite the fact that the MLP is trained without any input from these considered models, it correctly identifies the critical temperatures of the studied physical systems. Particularly, the MLP outcomes suggest convincingly that the $q=3$ model is critical only at zero temperature and $q=4,5,6$ models remain disordered at all temperatures. Previously, this MLP has been successfully applied to uncover the nature of the phase transitions of 2D antiferromagnetic Ising model with multi-interactions. Therefore, it will be interesting to examine whether the already trained MLP can detect other models with untypical critical phenomena.

Title: Controllable Emergence of Multiple Topological Anderson Insulator Phases in Photonic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Lattices
Authors: Ruijiang Ji, Yunbo Zhang, Shu Chen, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: We investigate the emergence and control of multiple topological Anderson insulator (TAI) phases in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) waveguide lattice with generalized Bernoulli-type disorder introduced in the intradimer couplings. By systematically varying the disorder configuration -- including the values and probabilities of the multivariate distribution -- we demonstrate that both the number and width of TAI phases can be precisely engineered. Analytical determination of topological phase boundaries via the inverse localization length shows excellent agreement with numerical simulations. Our results reveal a rich landscape of disorder-induced topological phase transitions, including multiple reentrant TAI phases that arise as the disorder amplitude increases. Furthermore, we show that the mean chiral displacement serves as a sensitive probe for detecting these topological transitions, providing a practical route for experimental realization in photonic waveguide lattices. This work establishes a versatile framework for designing quantum and photonic materials with customizable topological properties driven by tailored disorder.

Title: Single Flux Quantum Circuit Operation at Millikelvin Temperatures
Authors: Jason Walter, Adam C. Weis, Kan-Ting Tsai, Meng-Ju Yu, Naveen Katam, Alex F. Kirichenko, Oleg A. Mukhanov, Shu-Jen Han, Igor V. Vernik
Abstract: As quantum computing processors increase in size, there is growing interest in developing cryogenic electronics to overcome significant challenges to system scaling. Single flux-quantum (SFQ) circuits offer a promising alternative to remote, bulky, and power-hungry room temperature electronics. To meet the need for digital qubit control, readout, and co-processing, SFQ circuits must be adapted to operate at millikelvin temperatures near quantum processors. SEEQC's SFQuClass digital quantum management approach proximally places energy-efficient SFQ (ERSFQ) circuits and qubits in a multi-chip module. This enables extremely low power dissipation, compatible with a typical dilution cryostat's limited cooling power, while maintaining high processing speed and low error rates. We report on systematic testing from 4 K to 10 mK of a comprehensive set of ERSFQ cells, as well as more complex circuits such as programmable counters and demultiplexers used in digital qubit control. We compare the operating margins and error rates of these circuits and find that, at millikelvin, bias margins decrease and the center of the margins (i.e., the optimal bias current value) increases by ~15%, compared to 4.2 K. The margins can be restored by thermal annealing by reducing Josephson junction (JJ) critical current Ic. To provide guidance for how circuit parameters vary from 4.2 K to millikelvin, relevant analog process control monitors (PCMs) were tested in the temperature range of interest. The measured JJ critical current (of the PCM JJ arrays) increases by ~15% when decreasing temperature from 4.2 K to millikelvin, in good agreement with both theory and the empirically measured change in the center of bias margins for the tested digital circuits.

Title: OXtal: An All-Atom Diffusion Model for Organic Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Emily Jin, Andrei Cristian Nica, Mikhail Galkin, Jarrid Rector-Brooks, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Santiago Miret, Frances H. Arnold, Michael Bronstein, Avishek Joey Bose, Alexander Tong, Cheng-Hao Liu
Abstract: Accurately predicting experimentally-realizable 3D molecular crystal structures from their 2D chemical graphs is a long-standing open challenge in computational chemistry called crystal structure prediction (CSP). Efficiently solving this problem has implications ranging from pharmaceuticals to organic semiconductors, as crystal packing directly governs the physical and chemical properties of organic solids. In this paper, we introduce OXtal, a large-scale 100M parameter all-atom diffusion model that directly learns the conditional joint distribution over intramolecular conformations and periodic packing. To efficiently scale OXtal, we abandon explicit equivariant architectures imposing inductive bias arising from crystal symmetries in favor of data augmentation strategies. We further propose a novel crystallization-inspired lattice-free training scheme, Stoichiometric Stochastic Shell Sampling ($S^4$), that efficiently captures long-range interactions while sidestepping explicit lattice parametrization -- thus enabling more scalable architectural choices at all-atom resolution. By leveraging a large dataset of 600K experimentally validated crystal structures (including rigid and flexible molecules, co-crystals, and solvates), OXtal achieves orders-of-magnitude improvements over prior ab initio machine learning CSP methods, while remaining orders of magnitude cheaper than traditional quantum-chemical approaches. Specifically, OXtal recovers experimental structures with conformer $\text{RMSD}_1<0.5$ Å and attains over 80\% packing similarity rate, demonstrating its ability to model both thermodynamic and kinetic regularities of molecular crystallization.

Title: Quantum Correlation Assisted Cooling of Microwave Cavities Below the Ambient Temperature
Authors: Daryoosh Vashaee, Jahanfar Abouie
Abstract: We develop a theoretical framework for cooling a microwave cavity mode using a Poisson stream of internally correlated pairs of two-level systems and analyze its performance under realistic dissipation. Starting from a Lindblad model of a phonon-tethered cavity interacting with sequentially injected atom pairs, we derive closed-form expressions for the steady-state cavity occupation and effective temperature. Two coupling geometries are examined: a one-atom configuration, where only one member of each pair interacts with the cavity, and a two-atom configuration, where both atoms couple collectively. The single-atom model enables cooling below the phonon bath but not below the reservoir temperature, whereas the two-atom scheme exhibits enhanced refrigeration - pair correlations modify the cavity's upward and downward transition rates so that the steady-state temperature can fall well below that of the reservoir for weak phonon damping. We map the parameter space including detuning, coupling strength, damping, and intra-pair exchange, identifying cooling valleys near resonance and the crossover between reservoir- and phonon-dominated regimes. The two-atom configuration thus realizes a genuine quantum-enhanced cooling mechanism absent in the single-atom case. We further outline an experimental implementation using two superconducting qubits repeatedly prepared, coupled, and reset inside a 3D cavity. Realistic reset and flux-tuning protocols support MHz-rate interaction cycles, enabling engineered reservoirs to impose cavity temperatures of 50-120 mK even when the cryostat is at ~1 K, offering a pathway to autonomous, on-chip refrigeration of microwave modes in scalable quantum hardware.

Title: The late-time attractor structure of dynamical black branes
Authors: Yan Liu, Hao-Tian Sun
Abstract: The ringdown phase of a perturbed black hole is conventionally described by a linear superposition of quasinormal modes. However, as the AdS black brane approaches its final global equilibrium, this linear quasinormal mode description becomes inadequate, and nonlinear dynamics play a significant role in the late-stage evolution. We show that the interplay between nonlinear evolution and horizon dissipation in general relativity drives dynamical AdS black branes towards the final state along a unique path, independent of their initial perturbations. Through numerical simulations, we identify this late-time attractor and uncover the associated universal nonlinear behavior, characterized by a simple dimensionless relative amplitude in the dual hydrodynamic variables.

Title: Quantum geometrical effects in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Anton Montag, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: We explore the relation between quantum geometry in non-Hermitian systems and physically measurable phenomena. We highlight various situations in which the behavior of a non-Hermitian system is best understood in terms of quantum geometry, namely the notion of adiabatic potentials in non-Hermitian systems and the localization of Wannier states in periodic non-Hermitian systems. Further, we show that the non-Hermitian quantum metric appears in the response of the system upon time-periodic modulation, which one can use to experimentally measure the non-Hermitian quantum metric. We validate our results by providing numerical simulations of concrete exemplary systems.

Title: Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation
Authors: Rohit Goswami (1) ((1) Institute IMX and Lab-COSMO, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), CH-1015 Lausanne, Switzerland)
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and may often be trajectory dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization trajectories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimension surface defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using radial basis functions. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We validate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements.

Title: Intrinsic non-Markovian magnetisation dynamics
Authors: Felix Hartmann, Vivek Unikandanunni, Matias Bargheer, Eric E. Fullerton, Stefano Bonetti, Janet Anders
Abstract: Memory effects arise in many complex systems, from protein folding, to the spreading of epidemics and financial decisions. While so-called non-Markovian dynamics is common in larger systems with interacting components, observations in fundamental physical systems have been confined to specifically engineered cases. Here, we report the experimental observation of non-Markovian dynamics in an elemental material, crystalline cobalt. By driving this material with an intense terahertz electromagnetic field, we bring its magnetisation into a non-equilibrium state and follow its evolution. We measure the sample's low temperature magnetic response in the time domain which leads to an unexpectedly rich multi-peaked spectrum in the Fourier domain, that cannot be explained by established models. We use open quantum system theory, which predicts a non-Markovian memory kernel in the dynamical equations to capture the fundamental interaction between the spin system and the phonon bath. Simulations based on this theory produce a multi-peaked spectrum, which matches the measured one. Our non-Markovian approach is also able to reproduce the modification of the spectrum at higher temperatures. Our findings demonstrate that non-Markovian effects are observable at a much more fundamental level than previously thought, opening the door to their exploration and control in a broad range of condensed matter systems.

Title: Optimized Machine Learning Methods for Studying the Thermodynamic Behavior of Complex Spin Systems
Authors: Dmitrii Kapitan, Pavel Ovchinnikov, Konstantin Soldatov, Petr Andriushchenko, Vitalii Kapitan
Abstract: This paper presents a systematic study of the application of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) as an efficient and versatile tool for the analysis of critical and low-temperature phase states in spin system models. The problem of calculating the dependence of the average energy on the spatial distribution of exchange integrals for the Edwards-Anderson model on a square lattice with frustrated interactions is considered. We further construct a single convolutional classifier of phase states of the ferromagnetic Ising model on square, triangular, honeycomb, and kagome lattices, trained on configurations generated by the Swendsen-Wang cluster algorithm. Computed temperature profiles of the averaged posterior probability of the high-temperature phase form clear S-shaped curves that intersect in the vicinity of the theoretical critical temperatures and allow one to determine the critical temperature for the kagome lattice without additional retraining. It is shown that convolutional models substantially reduce the root-mean-square error (RMSE) compared with fully connected architectures and efficiently capture complex correlations between thermodynamic characteristics and the structure of magnetic correlated systems.

Title: Absence of charged pion condensation in a magnetic field with parallel rotation
Authors: Puyuan Bai, Lianyi He
Abstract: We investigate the critical temperature of a relativistic Bose-Einstein condensate of charged bosons driven by rotation in a parallel magnetic field [Y. Liu and I. Zahed, Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf120}, 032001 (2018)]. For non-interacting bosons, the critical temperature can only be determined for a system with fixed angular momentum. We find that the critical temperature of the non-interacting system vanishes due to the fact that the system is quasi-one-dimensional, indicating that non-interacting bosons cannot undergo Bose-Einstein condensation. For interacting bosons, we investigate a system with quartic self-interaction. We show that the order parameter vanishes and the off-diagonal long-range order is absent at any nonzero temperature because of the quasi-one-dimensional feature, in accordance with the Coleman-Mermin-Wagner-Hohenberg theorem.

Title: Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices
Authors: Yanyan He, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.

Title: Materium: An Autoregressive Approach for Material Generation
Authors: Niklas Dobberstein, Jan Hamaekers
Abstract: We present Materium: an autoregressive transformer for generating crystal structures that converts 3D material representations into token sequences. These sequences include elements with oxidation states, fractional coordinates and lattice parameters. Unlike diffusion approaches, which refine atomic positions iteratively through many denoising steps, Materium places atoms at precise fractional coordinates, enabling fast, scalable generation. With this design, the model can be trained in a few hours on a single GPU and generate samples much faster on GPUs and CPUs than diffusion-based approaches. The model was trained and evaluated using multiple properties as conditions, including fundamental properties, such as density and space group, as well as more practical targets, such as band gap and magnetic density. In both single and combined conditions, the model performs consistently well, producing candidates that align with the requested inputs.

Title: Optimization for growth condition of ultrathin hexagonal boron nitride on dielectric substrates via LPCVD
Authors: Meryem Bozkaya, Muhammet Nasuh Arık, Ali Altuntepe, Hakan Ateş, Recep Zan
Abstract: Hexagonal Boron Nitride (h-BN) is a highly intriguing candidate for heterostructure optoelectronic applications, such as Deep Ultraviolet photodetectors, UV sensing and communication systems and solar cells. This is primarily due to its unique properties, including a layer dependent wide energy bandgap, superior mechanical strength, high thermal conductivity, high band-edge absorption coefficient, and exceptional transparency in the UV region. The widely adopted synthesis method for h-BN thin films is Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) Method, which often utilizes catalytic substrates like copper (Cu) and Nickel (Ni). However, integrating the synthesized h-BN into device applications requires a subsequent transfer process to the target substrate. This transfer step introduces significant material damage, such as folding, cracking and polymer residues, which ultimately degrade the optoelectronic properties of the material and compromise device performance. To overcome this major challenge, there is a strong need to synthesize high-quality h-BN films directly onto dielectric substrates such as silicon (Si), SiO2, quartz, sapphire or AlN without the need for transfer. The primary difficulty in direct synthesis lies in achieving homogenous, high crystallinity films with controllable thickness due to the absence of a catalytic effect. In this work, we investigated the optimization of growth parameters for the direct synthesis of ultrathin h-BN films on non-catalytic quartz substrates, which are highly transparent in the UV region, using the Low-pressure Chemical Vapor Deposition (LPCVD) method. The optimal synthesis conditions were determined to be 1050oC for 60 min, achieved by the decomposition of 150 mg Ammonia Borane (AB) precursor at 80oC. This optimization is crucial for advancing large-scale, high-performance h-BN based DUV photodetector fabrication.

Title: Grand Canonical vs Canonical Krylov Complexity in Double-Scaled Complex SYK Model
Authors: Stefan Forste, Yannic Kruse, Saurabh Natu
Abstract: We consider the complex SYK model in the double-scaling limit. We obtain the transfer matrix for the grand canonical ensemble and symmetrize it. In the (n,Q)- basis of chord states, the grand canonical transfer matrix is block diagonal, where each block is the canonical transfer matrix for the respective charge sector. We therefore conclude that the Krylov complexity for the grand canonical ensemble is given by the sum of the complexities in the charge sectors weighted by a probability function that depends on the chemical potential. Finally, we compute the Krylov complexity analytically in the limit of early and late time in the charge sector and numerically for both canonical and grand canonical ensemble.

Title: Statistical properties of quantum jumps between macroscopic states of light: reading an operational coherence record
Authors: Th. K. Mavrogordatos
Abstract: We propose an experimental apparatus to reveal the quantum coherence manifested in downward quantum jumps of amplitude bistability. The underlying coherent superposition of macroscopic quantum states is translated into the statistical properties of the integrated charge deposited in the detector circuit of a mode-matched heterodyne/homodyne detection scheme. At first, the dynamical evolution of a signal transmitted from an auxiliary cavity is employed to pinpoint a macroscopic switching event in a bistable main cavity subject to direct photodetection. Once the decision is made on the occurrence of a downward switch, the main cavity mode is let to freely decay to the vacuum, monitored to the production of an integrated charge. In the long-time limit, the charge distribution over an identical collection of pure states generated during the jumps converges to the Q function (heterodyne detection) or marginals of the Wigner function (homodyne detection) dictated by the phase of the local oscillator. When fluctuations over the ensemble step in, we connect the statistical properties of several switching events and the ensuing production of current records, to the cavity field correlations associated with the breakdown of photon blockade.

Title: Trapped Fermions Through Kolmogorov-Arnold Wavefunctions
Authors: Paulo F. Bedaque, Jacob Cigliano, Hersh Kumar, Srijit Paul, Suryansh Rajawat
Abstract: We investigate a variational Monte Carlo framework for trapped one-dimensional mixture of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ fermions using Kolmogorov-Arnold networks (KANs) to construct universal neural-network wavefunction ansätze. The method can, in principle, achieve arbitrary accuracy, limited only by the Monte Carlo sampling and was checked against exact results at sub-percent precision. For attractive interactions, it captures pairing effects, and in the impurity case it agrees with known results. We present a method of systematic transfer learning in the number of network parameters, allowing for efficient training for a target precision. We vastly increase the efficiency of the method by incorporating the short-distance behavior of the wavefunction into the ansätz without biasing the method.

Title: Shape dependence of entanglement negativity and mutual information in quantum Hall and critical systems
Authors: Chia-Chuan Liu, Juliette Geoffrion, William Witczak-Krempa
Abstract: We study two entanglement measures in a large family of isotropic many-body states including incompressible quantum Hall liquids and quantum critical systems: the logarithmic negativity (LN), and mutual information (MI). For pure states, obtained for example from a bipartition at zero temperature, these provide distinct characterizations of the entanglement present between two spatial subregions, while for mixed states (such as at finite temperature) only the LN remains a good entanglement measure. Our focus is on regions that have corners, either adjacent or tip-touching. We first obtain general non-perturbative properties regarding the geometrical dependence of the LN and MI. A close similarity is observed with mutual charge fluctuations, where super-universal angle dependence holds allowing for explicit checks. For the MI, we make stronger statements due to strong subadditivity. We also give ramifications of our general analysis to conformal field theories (CFTs) in two spatial dimensions. We then explicitly verify these properties with integer quantum Hall states. To do so we develop two independent approaches to obtain the fermionic LN, which takes into account Fermi statistics: an overlap-matrix method, and a real-space lattice discretization. At finite temperature, we find a rapid decrease of the LN well inside the cyclotron gap at integer fillings. We further show that the LN decays faster compared to the MI at high temperatures.

Title: Post-experiment coincidence detection techniques for direct detection of two-body correlations
Authors: Dezhong Cao, Yuehua Su
Abstract: It is one challenge to develop experimental techniques for direct detection of the many-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons, which exhibit a variety of unsolved mysteries. In this article, we present a \textit{post-experiment} coincidence counting method and propose two \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques, \textit{post-experiment} coincidence angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (cARPES) and \textit{post-experiment} coincidence inelastic neutron scattering (cINS). By coincidence detection of two photoelectric processes or two neutron-scattering processes, the \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can detect directly the two-body correlations of strongly correlated electrons in particle-particle channel or two-spin channel. The \textit{post-experiment} coincidence detection techniques can be implemented upon the \textit{pulse}-resolved angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) or inelastic neutron scattering (INS) experimental apparatus with \textit{pulse} photon or neutron source. When implemented experimentally, they will be powerful techniques to study the highly esoteric high-temperature superconductivity and the highly coveted quantum spin liquids.

Title: Generalized Gibbs Ensemble from Eigenstate Entanglement Hamiltonian
Authors: Hao Chen, Biao Lian
Abstract: Relaxed quantum systems with conservation laws are believed to be approximated by the Generalized Gibbs Ensemble (GGE), which incorporates the constraints of certain conserved quantities serving as integrals of motion. By drawing an analogy between eigenstate reduced density matrix and GGE, we conjecture that a natural set of conserved quantities for GGE can emerge from the reduced density matrices of properly chosen eigenstates by the entanglement Hamiltonian superdensity matrix (EHSM) framework, and we demonstrate this explicitly for models mappable to free fermions. The framework proposes that such conserved quantities are linear superpositions of eigenstate entanglement Hamiltonians of a larger auxiliary system, where the eigenstates are Fock states occupying what we call the common eigenmodes, which remain eigenmodes when truncated within the physical subsystem. For 1D homogeneous free fermions with (anti-)periodic boundary conditions, which maps to 1D hardcore bosons with nearest neighbor hoppings, these conserved quantities lead to a non-Abelian GGE, which predicts the relaxation of both fermion and boson bilinears more accurately than the conventional Abelian GGE. Generalization of this framework may provide novel numerical insights for quantum integrability.

Title: Ultrasound evidence for multicomponent superconducting order parameter in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ with electron quadrupling phase
Authors: Chris Halcrow, Ilya Shipulin, Federico Caglieris, Yongwei Li, Joachim Wosnitza, Hans-Henning Klauss, Sergei Zherlitsyn, Vadim Grinenko, Egor Babaev
Abstract: Experiments have pointed to the formation of the electron quadrupling condensate in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$ at $x \sim 0.8$. The state spontaneously breaks time-reversal symmetry and is sandwiched between two critical points, separating it from the broken time-reversal symmetry (BTRS) superconducting state at $T_{\rm c}^{U(1)}$ and normal-metal state at $T_{\rm c}^{\rm Z2}$. We report a theory of the acoustic effects spectroscopy of systems with an electron quadrupling phase based on ultrasound-velocity measurements. We show that the experimental results are consistent with BTRS superconductivity at $x \sim 0.8$, fulfilling the necessary condition for the formation of electron quadrupling in Ba$_{1-x}$K$_x$Fe$_2$As$_2$. We provide the theoretical basis and the experimental strategy to study the order parameter symmetry of emerging quadrupling condensates in superconductors.

Title: Turbulence and far-from-equilibrium equation of state of Bogoliubov waves in Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Ying Zhu, Giorgio Krstulovic, Sergey Nazarenko
Abstract: Bogoliubov waves are fundamental excitations of Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs). They emerge from a perturbed ground state and interact nonlinearly, triggering turbulent cascades. Here, we study turbulent BECs theoretically and numerically using the 3D Gross-Pitaevskii model and its associated wave-kinetic equations. We derive a new Kolmogorov-like stationary spectrum for short Bogoliubov waves and find a complete analytical expression for the spectrum in the long-wave acoustic regime. We then use our predictions to explain the BEC equation of state reported in [Dora et al. Nature 620,521 (2023)], and to suggest new experimental settings.

Title: Spectral decomposition and high-accuracy Greens functions: Overcoming the Nyquist-Shannon limit via complex-time Krylov expansion
Authors: Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: The accurate computation of low-energy spectra of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems, typically accessed via Green's functions, is a long-standing problem posing enormous challenges to numerical methods. When the spectral decomposition is obtained from Fourier transforming a time series, the Nyquist-Shannon theorem limits the frequency resolution $\Delta \omega$ according to the numerically accessible time domain size $T$ via $\Delta \omega = 2\pi/T$. In tensor network methods, increasing the domain size is exponentially hard due to the ubiquitous spread of correlations, limiting the frequency resolution and thereby restricting this ansatz class mostly to one-dimensional systems with small quasi-particle velocities. Here, we show how this limitation can be overcome by augmenting the time series with complex-time Krylov states. At the example of the critical $S-1/2$ Heisenberg model and light bipolarons in the two-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, we demonstrate the enormous improvements in accuracy, which can be achieved using this method.

Title: Local Symmetry Breaking in Skyrmion-Hosting Centrosymmetric Hexagonal Compounds

Abstract: Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) plays a crucial role in stabilizing the exotic topologically stable skyrmion spin textures in the noncentrosymmetric crystals. The recent discovery of biskyrmions and skyrmions in the globally centrosymmetric crystals has raised debate about the role of the DMI in causing the spin textures, since DMI vanishes in such crystal structures. Theoretical studies, on the other hand, suggest non-vanishing DMI even if there is local inversion symmetry breaking in an otherwise globally centrosymmetric crystal structure. Motivated by such theoretical predictions, we present here the results of a systematic crystal structure study of two skyrmion-hosting Ni2In-type centrosymmetric hexagonal compounds, MnNiGa and MnPtGa, using the atomic pair distribution function (PDF) technique. Our result provides information about structural correlations in the short-range (SR), medium-range (MR) and long-range (LR) regimes simultaneously. The analysis of the experimental PDFs, obtained from high flux, high energy, and high Q synchrotron x-ray powder diffraction patterns, reveals that the local SR structure of both MnNiGa and MnPtGa compounds corresponds to the noncentrosymmetric trigonal space group P3m1, while the structure in the MR+LR regimes remains hexagonal in the centrosymmetric P63/mmc space group. These findings are also supported by theoretical DFT calculations. Our results, in conjunction with the previous theoretical predictions, provide a rationale for the genesis of skyrmions in centrosymmetric materials in terms of non-vanishing DMI due to local inversion symmetry breaking. We believe that our findings would encourage a systematic search of skyrmionic textures and other topological phenomena in a vast family of centrosymmetric materials.

Title: Unveiling Linker-Born Electron Spin Centers in UiO-66-NH2 MOF
Authors: Timur Biktagirov, Eugenio Otal, Leopold Trost, Patrick Dörflinger, Katsuya Teshima, Olga Trukhina, Daniel Klose, Wolf Gero Schmidt, Anastasiia Kultaeva
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), with their high porosity and large internal surface area, provide versatile platforms for integrating spin centers with potential applications in catalysis and quantum sensing. Here, we identify a stable NH radical spin center in UiO-66-NH2, a zirconium-based MOF with aminoterephthalic acid (TPA-NH2) linkers. Using electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy and density functional theory calculations, we determine the nature and spin Hamiltonian parameters of this radical. We also demonstrate that the NH spin center exhibits a relatively long coherence time, making it a strong candidate for quantum sensing. Since this spin center is intrinsic to TPA-NH2 linkers, our findings open new directions for leveraging organic radicals in MOFs for quantum technologies beyond the UiO-66-NH2 family.

Title: Intrinsically chiral exciton polaritons in an atomically-thin semiconductor

Abstract: Photonic bound states in the continuum (BICs) have emerged as a versatile tool for enhancing light-matter interactions by strongly confining light fields. Chiral BICs are photonic resonances with a high degree of circular polarisation, which hold great promise for spin-selective applications in quantum optics and nanophotonics. Here, we demonstrate a novel application of a chiral BIC for inducing strong coupling between the circularly polarised photons and spin-polarised (valley) excitons (bound electron-hole pairs) in atomically-thin transition metal dichalcogenide crystals (TMDCs). By placing monolayer WS$_2$ onto the BIC-hosting metasurface, we observe the formation of intrinsically chiral, valley-selective exciton polaritons, evidenced by circularly polarised photoluminescence (PL) at two distinct energy levels. The PL intensity and degree of circular polarisation of polaritons exceed those of uncoupled excitons in our structure by an order of magnitude. Our microscopic model shows that this enhancement is due to folding of the Brillouin zone creating a direct emission path for high-momenta polaritonic states far outside the light cone, thereby providing a shortcut to thermalisation (energy relaxation) and suppressing depolarisation. Moreover, while the polarisation of the upper polariton is determined by the valley excitons, the lower polariton behaves like an intrinsic chiral emitter with its polarisation fixed by the BIC. Therefore, the spin alignment of the upper and lower polaritons ($\uparrow\downarrow$ and $\uparrow \uparrow$) can be controlled by $\sigma^+$ and $\sigma^-$ polarised optical excitation, respectively. Our work introduces a new type of chiral light-matter quasi-particles in atomically-thin semiconductors and provides an insight into their energy relaxation dynamics.

Abstract: According to the Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory, the transition from a solid to liquid in two dimensions proceeds through an orientationally ordered liquid-like hexatic phase. However, alternative mixed melting scenarios, in which melting proceeds through the hexatic phase with both continuous and discontinuous transitions, have also been observed in some two-dimensional systems. In this study, we imaged silver iodide embedded in multilayer graphene using time- and temperature-resolved in situ atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy and nanobeam electron diffraction. We observed the hexatic phase and provide evidence supporting a mixed melting scenario.

Title: Machine-Learned Bond-Order Potential for Exploring the Configuration Space of Carbon
Authors: Ikuma Kohata, Kaoru Hisama, Keigo Otsuka, Shigeo Maruyama
Abstract: Construction of transferable machine-learning interatomic potentials with a minimal number of parameters is important for their general applicability. Here, we present a machine-learning interatomic potential with the functional form of the bond-order potential for comprehensive exploration over the configuration space of carbon. The physics-based design of this potential enables robust and accurate description over a wide range of the potential energy surface with a small number of parameters. We demonstrate the versatility of this potential through validations across various tasks, including phonon dispersion calculations, global structure searches for clusters, phase diagram calculations, and enthalpy-volume mappings of local minima structures. We expect that this potential can contribute to the discovery of novel carbon materials.

Title: The exact mobility edges in SVQL (slowly-varying quasiperiodic ladder) model
Authors: Arpita Goswami
Abstract: We propose a minimal two-leg ladder model in which the mobility edge (ME) arises solely due to bond modulation, introduced through a slowly varying quasiperiodic modulation in the inter-leg tunnelling amplitudes. We demonstrate that this bond-modulated ladder naturally hosts two propagation channels, whose symmetric and antisymmetric combinations experience opposite effective onsite potentials, unlike the one-dimensional quasiperiodic models with onsite modulations. Using the adiabatic (slowly varying) limit of the modulation, we derive an exact analytical condition for the single-particle mobility edge, $E_c=\pm|2t-\lambda|,$ where $t$ is the hopping amplitude along both the legs and $\lambda$ is the bond modulation strength. This result directly generalizes the classic ME condition for slowly varying onsite potentials to a multi-leg (two-leg in our case) geometry. Extensive numerical calculations, including inverse participation ratios, Lyapunov exponents, density of states, and participation-ratio scaling, demonstrate excellent agreement with the analytical prediction across a wide range of parameters. We further identify a regime for small modulation exponents $0 < \nu <1$, where localized and weakly delocalized states coexist even beyond the transition point ($\lambda_c=2t$). Our results establish that a deterministic bond modulation can serve as a sufficient ingredient to produce an exact ME in ladder systems, offering experimentally accessible routes toward tuning nonergodic extended phases.

Title: Memory-induced current reversal of Brownian motors
Authors: Mateusz Wiśniewski, Jakub Spiechowicz
Abstract: Kinetics of biological motors such as kinesin or dynein is notably influenced by viscoelastic intracellular environment. The characteristic relaxation time of the cytosol is not separable from the colloidal timescale and therefore their dynamics is inherently non-Markovian. In this paper we consider a variant of a Brownian motor model, namely a Brownian ratchet immersed in a correlated thermal bath and analyze how memory influences its dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate the memory-induced current reversal effect and explain this phenomenon by applying the effective mass approximation as well as uncovering the memory-induced dynamical localization of the motor trajectories in the phase space. Our results reveal new aspects of the role of memory in microscopic systems out of thermal equilibrium.

Title: Axion electrodynamics and giant magnetic birefringence in Weyl excitonic insulators
Authors: Anna Grigoreva, Anton Andreev, Leonid Glazman
Abstract: We study the electromagnetic (EM) response of the excitonic insulator phase of a time-reversal (TR) invariant Weyl semimetal (WSM). At low temperatures, the system develops two exciton condensates. The condensates are related to each other by TR symmetry and weakly coupled by a Josephson tunneling term. The latter leads to the formation of the Leggett mode [Number-phase fluctuations in two-band superconductors, Prog. Theor. Phys. 36, 901 (1966).] with a small gap. Our main finding is that the Leggett mode couples to the EM fields as a massive dynamical axion. This is a consequence of the chiral anomaly and the chiral magnetic effect in the parent WSM. Because of the small axion mass, its coupling to EM fields results in a giant anisotropic polarizability and birefringence in the presence of a static magnetic field. The photon-axion hybridization produces a polariton resonance near the axion gap.

Title: First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients
Authors: Go Uchida, Hiromi Miyoshi, Hitoshi Washizu
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the Lévy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.

Title: Dynamics of transport by helical edge states
Authors: Luis Alberto Razo López, Pierre Wulles, Geoffroy J. Aubry, Sergey E. Skipetrov, Fabrice Mortessagne
Abstract: Topologically nontrivial band structure of a material may give rise to special states that are confined to the material's boundary and protected against disorder and scattering. Quantum spin Hall effect (QSHE) is a paradigmatic example of phenomenon in which such states appear in the presence of time-reversal symmetry in two dimensions. Whereas the spatial structure of these helical edge states has been largely studied, their dynamic properties are much less understood. We design a microwave experiment mimicking QSHE and explore the spatiotemporal dynamics of unidirectional transport of optical angular momentum (or pseudospin) by edge states. Pseudospin-polarized signal propagation is shown to be immune to scattering by defects introduced along the edge. Its velocity is 2 to 3 orders of magnitude slower than the speed of light in the free space, which may have important consequences for practical applications of topological edge states in modern optical and quantum-information technologies.

Title: Light Control of Triplet Pairing in Correlated Electrons with Mixed-Sign Interactions
Authors: Zecheng Shen, Chendi Xie, Wei-Chih Chen, Yao Wang
Abstract: Spin-triplet superconductivity is a key platform for topological quantum computing, yet its experimental realization and control in solid-state materials remain a significant challenge. For this purpose, we propose an ultrafast optical strategy to manipulate spin-triplet superconductivity by leveraging $p$-wave pairing instabilities in the extended Hubbard model, a framework applicable to transition-metal oxides. Utilizing Floquet engineering, we demonstrate that transient flipping of the effective spin-exchange interaction can enhance $p$-wave pairing correlations under linearly polarized optical pulses. Furthermore, we reveal that this emergent spin-triplet pairing in strongly correlated systems can be selectively switched by an orthogonal optical pulse. This work provides a new pathway for stabilizing and controlling spin-triplet superconductivity in correlated materials.

Title: Diagnostics of Hilbert space fragmentation, freezing transition, and its effects in the family of quantum East models involving varying range of constraints
Authors: Sreemayee Aditya
Abstract: This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q>1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.

Title: Critical Structural Parameter Determining Magnetic Phases in the Fe2Mo3O8 Altermagnet System

Abstract: A systematic structural study of the Fe2Mo3O8 system as a function of pressure, temperature, and magnetic field reveals that the P63mc space group of this material remains stable for a broad range of these parameters. No changes are seen in the long-range structure for pressures between 0 and 10 GPa, temperatures between 11 K and 300 K, and magnetic fields up to 9 T. The magnetostructural response (delta c/c) for a magnetic field transverse to the c-axis displacement is determined. The system is found to exhibit strong magnetostructural coupling. The well-known magnetic-field-induced first-order transition is found to be isostructural, between two distinct altermagnet states, and is accessible by fields in the a-b plane. In terms of the c/a ratio, the structures between ambient pressure and 10 GPa are found to map onto the full Zn doping range ((Fe1-yZny)2Mo3O8,0<y<1) in this system. The results show that the critical sensitive structural parameter for tuning the magnetic properties with pressure, temperature, and pressure is the c-axis length. The results indicate that the magnetic order in this complex metal oxide system (A2Mo3O8, A=Co, Mn, and Ni) can be cleanly tuned by pressure, making this class of materials an excellent platform for magnetic order switching in films grown on piezoelectric substrates.

Title: Thermodynamic bounds on energy use in quasi-static Deep Neural Networks
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko
Abstract: The rapid growth of deep neural networks (DNNs) has brought increasing attention to their energy use during training and inference. Here, we establish the thermodynamic bounds on energy consumption in quasi-static analog DNNs by mapping modern feedforward architectures onto a physical free-energy functional. This framework provides a direct statistical-mechanical interpretation of quasi-static DNNs. As a result, inference can proceed in a thermodynamically reversible manner, with vanishing minimal energy cost, in contrast to the Landauer limit that constrains digital hardware. Importantly, inference corresponds to relaxation to a unique free-energy minimum with F_{\min}=0, allowing all constraints to be satisfied without residual stress. By comparison, training overconstrains the system: simultaneous clamping of inputs and outputs generates stresses that propagate backward through the architecture, reproducing the rules of backpropagation. Parameter annealing then relaxes these stresses, providing a purely physical route to learning without an explicit loss function. We further derive a universal lower bound on training energy, E< 2NDkT, which scales with both the number of trainable parameters and the dataset size.

Title: Inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation and entropy production
Authors: Van Tuan Vo, Andreas Dechant, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Nonequilibrium current fluctuations represent one of the central topics in nonequilibrium physics. The thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) is widely acclaimed for rigorously establishing a lower bound on current fluctuations, expressed in terms of the entropy production rate and the average current. In this study, we focus on an upper bound for the fluctuations, referred to as the inverse thermodynamic uncertainty relation (iTUR). We derive a universal iTUR expression in terms of the entropy production rate for continuous-variable systems governed by overdamped Langevin equations, as well as for discrete-variable systems described by Markov jump processes. The iTUR establishes a no-go theorem prohibiting perpetual superdiffusion in systems with a finite entropy production rate and a finite spectral gap. The divergence of the variance of any current becomes possible only when the spectral gap of the symmetrized time-evolution operator closes or the entropy production rate diverges. As a relevant experimental scenario, we apply the iTUR to the phenomenon of giant diffusion, emphasizing the pivotal roles of the spectral gap and entropy production.

Title: Effects of Berry curvature on ideal fractional Chern insulator many-body gaps
Authors: Jingtian Shi, Jennifer Cano, Nicolás Morales-Durán
Abstract: We investigate the many-body ground states in a family of fractionally-filled bands where the Berry curvature fluctuations can be tuned while maintaining ideal quantum geometry. We numerically find that the neutral gap of the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) ground state decreases as the Berry curvature becomes less homogeneous, ultimately driving an instability to a charge density wave. We further extend our analysis to bands perturbed away from the ideal limit and give examples where a less ideal band geometry results in a more stable FCI phase. To explain our findings, we apply the single mode approximation to the ground state wave functions of the ideal band, from which we obtain analytic expressions for the magnetoroton minimum. Finally, we make a connection between our results and experimentally relevant systems where FCIs have been observed.

Title: Family of Aperiodic Tilings with Tunable Quantum Geometric Tensor
Authors: Hector Roche Carrasco, Justin Schirmann, Aurelien Mordret, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: The strict geometric rules that define aperiodic tilings lead to the unique spectral and transport properties of quasicrystals, but also limit our ability to design them. In this Letter, we explore a novel example of a continuously tunable family of two-dimensional aperiodic tilings in which the underlying real-space geometry becomes a control knob of the wavefunction's quantum geometric tensor. The real-space geometry can be used to tune into topological phases occupying an expanded phase space compared to crystals, or into a disorder-driven topological Anderson insulator. The quantum metric can also be tuned continuously, opening new routes towards tunable single- and many-body physics in aperiodic solid-state and synthetic systems.

Title: Activation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization by domain walls in altermagnets
Authors: Sopheak Sorn, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a Néel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the Néel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.

Abstract: Solid-state platforms based on bosonic quasiparticles offer a compelling route toward on-chip quantum information technologies scalable to nanometer dimensions. Coherence time, a key figure of merit for any quantum system, is fundamentally limited by the lifetime of quasiparticles that store quantum information. For magnons - bosonic excitations of collective magnetization dynamics - it has long been reported that their lifetime does not exceed a few hundred nanoseconds, placing a stringent constraint on their use in quantum architectures. Here, we demonstrate magnon lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s. Experiments performed on single-crystal yttrium iron garnet spheres cooled to 30 mK reveal relaxation times of short-wavelength magnons nearly two orders of magnitude longer than previously observed. These findings overturn the established view of magnon dissipation limits, positioning magnons as viable, long-lived information carriers for solid-state quantum computing.

Title: Symmetry Classification for Alternating Excitons in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Jiayu David Cao, Konstantin S. Denisov, Yuntian Liu, Igor Zutic
Abstract: Excitons, bound electron-holes states, often dominate the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials and reflect their inherent properties, including spin-orbit coupling, magnetic ordering, or band topology. By focusing on a growing class of collinear antiferromagnets with a nonrelativistic spin splitting, referred to also as altermagnets (AM), we propose a theoretical framework based on the spin space group (SSG) to elucidate their resulting excitons. Our approach is illustrated on 2D AM with spin-polarized valleys, where we classify the combination of conduction and valence bands by the SSG representations into two cases that hosts bright $s$-like and $p$-like excitons, respectively. This analysis is further supported by effective Hamiltonians and the Bethe-Salpeter equation. We identify the excitonic optical selection rules from the calculated absorption spectra and the symmetry of bright excitons from their momentum space envelope functions. Our framework provides optical fingerprints for various cases of AM, while their tunability, such as the strain-induced valley splitting, is also transferred to excitons allowing, additionally, valley-polarized photocurrent generation.

Title: Intrinsic defects as a source of $\textit{n}$-type conductivity in CrSBr
Authors: Timur Biktagirov, Wolf Gero Schmidt, Karl Jakob Schiller, Michele Capra, Jonah Elias Nitschke, Lasse Sternemann, Anna Isaeva, Mirko Cinchetti
Abstract: Understanding and controlling native defects is essential for unlocking the full potential of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors. Here, angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and first-principles calculations are used to explore the electronic properties of bulk CrSBr. ARPES measurements reveal clear signatures of conduction band filling in as-grown crystals, indicative of unintentional doping. An analysis of intrinsic defects based on density functional theory (DFT) identifies chromium interstitials ($Cr_i$) stabilized between CrSBr layers as the most favorable shallow donors. Bromine-on-sulfur antisites ($Br_S$) and bromine vacancies ($V_{Br}$) are also found to act as potential donors, albeit with deeper ionization energies. Our results shed light on the origin of unintentional $\textit{n}$-type doping of CrSBr and pave the way for new strategies for defect control and electronic property tuning in this van der Waals magnet.

Title: Interface Fragmentation via Horizontal Vibration: A Pathway to Scalable Monodisperse Emulsification
Authors: Linfeng Piao, Anne Juel
Abstract: We present a scalable method for producing monodisperse micro-scale emulsions in a rectangular container holding two stably stratified layers of immiscible liquids by applying horizontal vibration. This setup enables the excitation of a single line of ordered Faraday waves along each end wall when viscous forces dominate interfacial dynamics. Our experiments and theoretical modelling show that the critical non-dimensional acceleration for the breakup of the wave tips in a regular array of droplets scales as $N^{-1/2} \omega^{*3/2}$, where $N$ is the kinematic viscosity ratio and $\omega^{*}$ is the frequency of forcing on the viscous-capillary scale. The droplet diameter can be easily tuned by varying the forcing parameters, and the number of droplets generated per cycle is proportional to the width of the container.

Title: Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal
Authors: Yifei Bai, Anna R. Dardia, Toshihiko Shimasaki, David M. Weld
Abstract: Light-induced quantum phases offer the potential for simple and powerful tuning of material properties. For example, simply illuminating 2D materials in the integer quantum Hall regime with polarized light is predicted to drive quantum phase transitions. Such phenomena are largely beyond the current frontier of solid state experiments due to technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report results of such an experiment. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in anomalous polarization-dependent subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.

Title: Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Kuangjie Chen, Yang Qi, Zheng Yan, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Topology and Localizations in a 2D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Model with Domain Walls, Quasi-periodic Disorder and Periodic Hopping Modulations
Authors: Surajit Mandal, Satyaki Kar
Abstract: A two dimensional (2D) Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with topological defects like domain walls (DW) / vortices or quasi-periodic disorders is a perfect blend for investigating topology and localization of quantum states. In a 2D SSH model, zero energy states (ZES) lie within the dispersion continuum for both periodic and open boundaries. We consider two different distribution of DWs of which the first one shows the bound states in continuum (BIC) to populate at the corners (producing higher order topological modes) or the DW center while the second one, with a vortex like radially symmetric distribution of hopping modulations, shows localizations along the DWs and the edges. The topological yet gapped in-gap states, with nonzero Zak phases, show an opposite trend with localizations at the edges and along the DWs in the first case as opposed to localizations at the DW center in the second case. Investigation on the effect of on-site quasiperiodic disorders manifests the usual tendency of the states to localize. However, reentrant localization behavior is also captured for judicious choice of the disordered term, making this the first reported example of its kind in a 2D system. Furthermore, while varying the hopping periodicity, we discover that anisotropic hopping modulations along x and y directions within the lattice produces significant changes in topological features where bulk ZES get exhausted leaving only topological boundary modes at zero energies. We also discuss the fate of these states in presence of the DWs. All these analysis depicting topological/localization features of varied kinds can become very useful in the field of quantum computation and information processing.

Title: Wetting and Pattern Formation in Non-Reciprocal Ternary Phase Separation
Authors: Xiao Ma, Michael E. Cates
Abstract: Non-reciprocal interactions are among the simplest mechanisms that drive a physical system out of thermal equilibrium, leading to novel phenomena such as oscillatory pattern formation. In this paper, we introduce a ternary phase separation model, with non-reciprocal interactions between two of the three phases and a spectator phase that mimics a boundary. Through numerical simulations, we uncover three distinct phase behaviours: a quasi-static regime, characterized by well-defined non-equilibrium contact angles at the three phase contact line; a limit cycle regime, with the three bulk phases rotating around the three phase contact line; and a travelling wave regime, featuring persistent directional motion. We complement our numerical findings with analytical examination of linear stability and the wave propagation speed near equilibrium. Our model provides a minimal framework for extending classical equilibrium wetting theory to active and non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Superconductivity governed by Janus-faced fermiology in strained bilayer nickelates
Authors: Siheon Ryee, Niklas Witt, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Tim O. Wehling
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity in pressurized and strained bilayer nickelates (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has emerged as a new frontier. One of the key unresolved issues concerns the fermiology that underlies superconductivity. On both theoretical and experimental sides, no general consensus has been reached, and conflicting results exist regarding whether the relevant Fermi surface involves a $\gamma$ pocket -- a hole pocket with $d_{z^2}$-orbital character centered at the Brillouin zone corner. Here, we address this issue by unveiling a Janus-faced role of the $\gamma$ pocket in spin-fluctuation-mediated superconductivity. We show that this pocket simultaneously induces dominant pair-breaking and pair-forming channels for the leading $s_\pm$-wave pairing. Consequently, an optimal superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$ is achieved when the $\gamma$ pocket surfaces at the Fermi level, placing the system near a Lifshitz transition. This suggests that superconductivity can emerge, provided the maximum energy level of the $\gamma$ pocket lies sufficiently close to the Fermi level, either from below or above. Our finding not only reconciles two opposing viewpoints on the fermiology, but also naturally explains recent experiments on (La,Pr)$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films, including the superconductivity under compressive strain, two conflicting measurements on the Fermi surface, and the dome shape of $T_\mathrm{c}$ as a function of hole doping.

Title: Spontaneous Quantum Turbulence in a Newborn Bose-Einstein Condensate via the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism
Authors: Seong-Ho Shinn, Matteo Massaro, Mithun Thudiyangal, Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: The Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM) predicts the spontaneous formation of topological defects in a continuous phase transition driven at a finite rate. We propose the generation of spontaneous quantum turbulence (SQT) via the KZM during Bose-Einstein condensation induced by a thermal quench. Using numerical simulations of the stochastic projected Gross-Pitaevskii equation in two spatial dimensions, we describe the formation of a newborn Bose-Einstein condensate proliferated by quantum vortices. We establish the nonequilibrium universality of SQT through the Kibble-Zurek and Kolmogorov scaling of the incompressible kinetic energy.

Title: A canonical approach to quantum fluctuations
Authors: Joanna Ruhl, Vanja Dunjko, Maxim Olshanii
Abstract: We present a canonical formalism for computing quantum fluctuations of certain discrete degrees of freedom in systems governed by integrable partial differential equations with known Hamiltonian structure, provided these models are classical-field approximations of underlying many-body quantum systems. We then apply the formalism to both the 2-soliton and 3-soliton breather solutions of the nonlinear Schrödinger equation, assuming the breathers are created from an initial elementary soliton by quenching the coupling constant. In particular, we compute the immediate post-quench quantum fluctuations in the positions, velocities, norms, and phases of the constituent solitons. For each case, we consider both the white-noise and correlated-noise models for the fluctuation vacuum state. Unlike previous treatments of the problem, our method allows for analytic solutions. Additionally, in the correlated-noise case, we consider the particle-number-conserving (also called $U(1)$-symmetry-conserving) Bogoliubov modes, i.e., modes with the proper correction to preserve the total particle number. We find that in most (but not all) cases, these corrections do not change the final result.

Title: Charge Regulation Effect on Nanoparticles Interaction Mediated by Polyelectrolyte
Authors: Vijay Yadav, Prabhat Kumar Jaiswal, Rudolf Podgornik, Sunita Kumari
Abstract: The ability to precisely control surface charge using charged polymers is fundamental to many nanotechnology applications, enabling the design and fabrication of materials with tailored properties and functionalities. Here, we study the effect of charge regulation (CR) on the interaction between two nanoparticles (NPs) mediated by an oppositely charged polyelectrolyte (PE) in an electrolyte solution. To this end, we employ a hybrid CR Monte Carlo / molecular dynamics simulation framework to systematically explore the effects of pH, salt concentration, and polymer chain length on NP surface charge behavior. For comparison, we also conduct molecular simulations under constant charge (CC) conditions. Our results reveal that CR enhances PE adsorption onto NP surfaces compared to the CC case, where polymer bridging dominates across a wide range of NP intersurface separations. This enhanced adsorption under CR leads to a weak net repulsion driven by osmotic forces. In contrast, the CC model yields a stronger net attraction due to the bridging force. Furthermore, we find that the CR effects are more pronounced at low salt concentration, whereas at high salt concentration, counterion screening dominates in both CR and CC cases, diminishing the CR effect. These findings highlight the importance of incorporating charge regulation in characterizing nanoparticle interactions within a complex biochemical environment, particularly in low salt concentrations.

Title: Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid
Authors: Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun
Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.

Title: A Hartree-Fock Analysis of the Finite Jellium Model
Authors: Michael Píro, Jaroslav Hamrle
Abstract: A Hartree--Fock analysis of the ground-state electronic structure of the finite spherical jellium model is carried out for systems containing up to $520$ electrons in a positive background field with densities ranging from $10^{-3}$ to $1$. The study focuses on quantifying the effects of confinement on the local-density models of the exchange and kinetic energies used in orbital-free density-based quantum computation methods. Significant discrepancies are observed between the energies obtained from the Hartree--Fock approximation and those predicted by the local density approximation (LDA) and the Thomas--Fermi model (TF) evaluated at the computed electron densities, both in the inner region and on the surface of the system. To reconcile these differences, refined expressions for the local one-electron energy densities, parametrized by the system's size and background charge density, are proposed. These models are also compared with commonly used gradient-based energy functionals.

Title: Generalized Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm
Authors: Abdelrahman S. Abdelrahman, Shuvro Chowdhury, Flaviano Morone, Kerem Y. Camsari
Abstract: We introduce a generalized \textit{Probabilistic Approximate Optimization Algorithm (PAOA)}, a classical variational Monte Carlo framework that extends and formalizes prior work by Weitz \textit{et al.}~\cite{Combes_2023}, enabling parameterized and fast sampling on present-day Ising machines and probabilistic computers. PAOA operates by iteratively modifying the couplings of a network of binary stochastic units, guided by cost evaluations from independent samples. We establish a direct correspondence between derivative-free updates and the gradient of the full Markov flow over the exponentially large state space, showing that PAOA admits a principled variational formulation. Simulated annealing emerges as a limiting case under constrained parameterizations, and we implement this regime on an FPGA-based probabilistic computer with on-chip annealing to solve large 3D spin-glass problems. Benchmarking PAOA against QAOA on the canonical 26-spin Sherrington-Kirkpatrick model with matched parameters reveals superior performance for PAOA. We show that PAOA naturally extends simulated annealing by optimizing multiple temperature profiles, leading to improved performance over SA on heavy-tailed problems such as SK-Lévy.

Title: Unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators
Authors: Wei Jia, Yuping Tian, Huanhuan Yang, Xiangru Kong, Zhi-Hao Huang, Wei-Jiang Gong, Jun-Hong An
Abstract: Exploring novel topological matters with exotic quantum states has always been a core issue in the field of condensed matter physics, which can update the understanding of topological phases and broaden the classification of topological materials. Here, we report a class of unconventional hybrid-order topological insulators (HyOTIs), which simultaneously host various different higher-order topological states in a single band gap. Such topological states exhibit a unique bulk-boundary correspondence that is different from the well-known first-order topological states, higher-order topological states, and the coexistence of both. Particularly, we develop a generic surface theory to precisely capture them and discover a three-dimensional unconventional HyOTI protected by inversion symmetry, which renders both helical and corner topological states and exhibits an unprecedented bulk-edge-corner correspondence. By adjusting the parameters of the system, we also observe the nontrivial phase transitions between the inversion-symmetric HyOTI and other conventional phases. We further propose a circuit-based experimental scheme to detect these interesting results. Remarkably, we demonstrate that a modified tight-binding model of bismuth can support the unconventional HyOTI, suggesting a possible route for its material realization. This work shall significantly advance the research of hybrid topological states in both theory and experiment.

Title: Solving Sudoku using oscillatory neural networks
Authors: Bram F. Haverkort, Federico Sbravati, Stefan Porfir, Aida Todri-Sanial
Abstract: We explore the capabilities of physical computing with Oscillatory Neural Networks (ONN) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. To solve Sudokus with ONNs, we define a novel mapping strategy that utilizes the unique characteristics of the computation paradigm. The problem is encoded through a puzzle specific graph-embedding, which implements the constraints through different subgraphs. These subgraphs are then combined into a single adjacency matrix, which allows the natural dynamics of the phases of coupled oscillators to find a solution to the puzzle. We model the phase dynamics of the ONN by means of the Kuramoto differential equation. This novel approach is then compared to the well-established iterative method to solve Sudoku already used in binary Hopfield networks (HNN). Solving optimization problems typically requires a large amount of energy to solve on conventional hardware. Therefore, we are motivated to explore the mapping of Sudoku from a theoretical point of view to establish the validity of this approach. The simulation results show that the novel ONN mapping outperforms the established HNN methodology.

Title: Spin-liquid and spin-glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions
Authors: Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Spin-liquid and spin-glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remains challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin-liquid and spin-glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among p spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size N dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of p. We show that the phase diagrams for different p can be unified through a scaling with N/p2, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin-liquid phase and extends the spin-glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin-liquid phase transitions into the spin-glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.

Title: Effective permeability conditions for diffusive transport through impermeable membranes with gaps
Authors: Molly Brennan, Edwina F. Yeo, Philip Pearce, Mohit P. Dalwadi
Abstract: Membranes regulate transport in a wide variety of industrial and biological applications. The microscale geometry of the membrane can significantly affect overall transport through the membrane, but the precise nature of this multiscale coupling is not well characterised in general. Motivated by the application of transport across a bacterial membrane, in this paper we use formal multiscale analysis to derive explicit effective coupling conditions for macroscale transport across a two-dimensional impermeable membrane with periodically spaced gaps, and validate these with numerical simulations. We derive analytic expressions for effective macroscale quantities associated with the membrane, such as the permeability, in terms of the microscale geometry. Our results generalise the classic constitutive membrane coupling conditions to a wider range of membrane geometries and time-varying scenarios. Specifically, we demonstrate that if the exterior concentration varies in time, for membranes with long channels, the transport gains a memory property where the coupling conditions depend on the system history. By applying our effective conditions in the context of small molecule transport through gaps in bacterial membranes called porins, we predict that bacterial membrane permeability is primarily dominated by the thickness of the membrane. Furthermore, we predict how alterations to membrane microstructure, for example via changes to porin expression, might affect overall transport, including when external concentrations vary in time. These results will apply to a broad range of physical applications with similar membrane structures, from medical and industrial filtration to carbon capture.

Title: Reconfiguration of a Magnetic Tunnel Junction as a Way to Turn It into a Field-Free Vortex Oscillator
Authors: Maksim Stebliy, Alex Jenkins, Luana Benetti, Ricardo Ferreira
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are key elements in practical spintronics, enabling not only conventional tasks such as data storage, transmission, and processing but also the implementation of compute-in-memory processing elements, facilitating the development of efficient hardware for neuromorphic computing. The functionality of an MTJ is determined by the properties of its free layer (FL) and reference layer (RL) with fixed magnetization, separated by an MgO tunnel barrier. This paper presents a mechanism for reconfiguring the RL, which is the upper layer of a pinned synthetic antiferromagnet, enabling a reversible transition from a single-domain state to a vortex magnetic state with different core positions. When the RL is in the vortex state, it generates a spin current with a vortex-like polarization distribution, enabling stable vortex oscillations in the FL even in the absence of external magnetic fields. This effect has been confirmed in MTJs with diameters ranging from 400 to 1000 nm. It is demonstrated, using experimental data with comparative micromagnetic simulation, that the pinning antiferromagnet retains a long term memory of previous reannealing states resulting in a deformation of the vortex polarised spin current, which in turn introduces a strong dynamical vortex core polarity symmetry breaking. The analogue reprogrammable nature of both the static and dynamic properties of the MTJ demonstrate different possible routes for the introduction of non-volatility into radiofrequency spintronic neuromorphic paradigms.

Title: Integrating Macrostate Probability Distributions with Swing Adsorption Modeling for Binary/Ternary Gas Separation
Authors: Sunghyun Yoon, Jui Tu, Li-Chiang Lin, Yongchul G. Chung
Abstract: Accurate and efficient prediction of multicomponent adsorption equilibria across pressures, temperatures, and compositions remain a central challenge for designing energy-efficient adsorption-based separation processes. Traditional approaches, including model fitting and ideal adsorbed solution theory (IAST), often fail to balance accuracy, computational efficiency, and transferability under process-relevant conditions. Here, we introduce a material-to-process modeling framework that integrates macrostate probability distributions (MPDs) from flat-histogram Monte Carlo simulations with rigorous cyclic process optimization. MPDs directly capture the joint occupancy distributions of adsorbates, producing reweightable landscape that enables high-fidelity mixture adsorption equilibria without repeated simulations or model assumptions. We show that coupling this statistical mechanical foundation with process modeling delivers accurate and computationally efficient evaluations for binary and ternary gas mixture separations. This integration establishes MPD-based modeling as a generalized method for predictive multicomponent adsorption equilibria, accelerating the discovery and design of adsorbent materials for carbon capture and other separation challenges.

Title: A Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian Model for Hyperthermal Hydrogen Scattering from a Semiconductor Surface
Authors: Xuexun Lu, Nils Hertl, Sara Oregioni, Riley Preston, Samuel L. Rudge, Michael Thoss, Rocco Martinazzo, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Collisions of atoms and molecules with metal surfaces create electronic excitations in the metal, leading to nonadiabatic energy dissipation, inelastic scattering, and sticking. Mixed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulation methods, such as molecular dynamics with electronic friction, are able to capture nonadiabatic energy loss during dynamics at metal surfaces. Hydrogen atom scattering from semiconductors, on the other hand, exhibits strong adsorbate-surface energy transfer only when the projectile kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the substrate. Electronic friction fails to describe this effect. Here, we report a first-principles parameterization of a simple Haldane-Anderson Hamiltonian model of hydrogen atom gas-surface scattering on Ge(111)$c(2\times8)$, for which hyperthermal scattering experiments have been reported. We subsequently perform independent-electron surface hopping and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations on this model, and validate these results through numerically exact quantum-dynamical simulations using the hierarchical equation of motion approach. While mean-field dynamics yield weak nonadiabatic energy loss that is independent of the initial kinetic energy, independent electron surface hopping simulations qualitatively agree with the experimental observation that nonadiabatic energy dissipation only occurs if the initial kinetic energy exceeds the bandgap of the surface.

Title: An exact multiple-time-step variational formulation for the committor and the transition rate
Authors: Chatipat Lorpaiboon, Jonathan Weare, Aaron R. Dinner
Abstract: For a transition between two stable states, the committor is the probability that the dynamics leads to one stable state before the other. It can be estimated from trajectory data by minimizing an expression for the transition rate that depends on a lag time. We show that an existing such expression is minimized by the exact committor only when the lag time is a single time step, resulting in a biased estimate in practical applications. We introduce an alternative expression that is minimized by the exact committor at any lag time. The key idea is that, when trajectories enter the stable states, the times that they enter (stopping times) must be used for estimating the committor and transition rate instead of the lag time. Numerical tests on benchmark systems demonstrate that our committor and transition rate estimates are much less sensitive to the choice of lag time. We show how further accuracy for the transition rate can be achieved by combining results from two lag times. We also relate the transition rate expression to a variational approach for kinetic statistics based on the mean-squared residual and discuss further numerical considerations with the aid of a decomposition of the error into dynamic modes.

Title: Hidden Moiré Topology of Low-Symmetry Weyl Surfaces

Abstract: Topological materials are defined by the correspondence between bulk topology and boundary states, yet this correspondence becomes enigmatic on low-symmetry surfaces where bulk and surface periodicities are inherently mismatched. Here we reveal a hidden moiré topology emerging on the (103) surface of the Weyl semimetal NdAlSi. Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy uncovers closed Fermi-arc loops and momentum-space moiré modulations, phenomena unanticipated in conventional topological theory. We show that these emerge from incomplete bulk projection and multi-cell interference governed by a least-common-multiple framework. Least-common-multiple guided DFT and Green's-function calculations quantitatively reproduce the observed spectra, establishing the universality of this commensuration rule. These findings transform a long-standing paradox of bulk-boundary correspondence into a new paradigm of momentum-space moiré reconstruction, bridging crystalline and quasicrystalline topologies and opening routes to flat-band engineering on complex surfaces.

Title: Capillarity in Stationary Random Granular Media: Distribution-Aware Screening and Quantitative Supercell Sizing
Authors: Christian Tantardini, Fernando Alonso-Marroquin
Abstract: We develop a quantitative framework to determine the minimal periodic supercell required for representative simulations of capillarity-screened Darcy flow in stationary random, polydisperse granular media. The microstructure is characterized by two-point statistics (covariance and spectral density) that govern finite-size fluctuations. Capillarity is modeled as a screened, modified-Helmholtz problem with phase-dependent transport under periodic boundary conditions; periodic homogenization yields an apparent conductivity, an apparent screening parameter, and a macroscopic capillary decay length. Because screening imparts a spatial low-pass response, we introduce a distribution-aware treatment of polydispersity consisting of a capillarity-weighted volume fraction and a screened analogue of the integral range that preserves variance units and recovers classical descriptors in the appropriate limits. These descriptors lead to two sizing rules: (i) a length criterion on the shortest cell edge controlled by a microstructural correlation length, the macroscopic decay length, and a high quantile of grain size; and (ii) a volume criterion that links the target coefficient of variation to the screened integral range and the phase contrast. The framework couples statistical microstructure information to capillary response and yields reproducible, distribution-aware supercell selection for image-based finite-element or fast-Fourier-transform solvers.

Title: Structural and Compositional Complexities of Hierarchical Self-Assembly: a Hypergraph Approach
Authors: Alexei V. Tkachenko
Abstract: Programmable self-assembly enables the construction of complex molecular, supramolecular, and crystalline architectures from well-designed building blocks. We introduce a hypergraph-based formalism, Blocks & Bonds (B&B), that generalizes classical chemical graph theory by incorporating directed and multicolored interactions, internal symmetries, and hierarchical organization. Within this framework, we develop the Structure Code (SC), a compact and versatile language for describing self-assembled architectures. We define a Kolmogorov-style Structural Complexity as the total information content of SC, obtained through its tokenization and Shannon information assignment. Complementing this encoding-based measure, we introduce a much simpler quantity, the Compositional Complexity, which depends only on the number and cumulative usage of block and bond types in the construction set. A central result of this work is a strong empirical correlation between the token-based Structural Complexity and the Compositional Complexity across all examined systems. Owing to this agreement, the Compositional Complexity emerges as the most practical and broadly applicable measure: it is easy to compute, requires no explicit encoding, and yet closely tracks the actual information content of structurally diverse architectures. Applications to molecular systems (ethylene glycol, glucose), DNA-origami lattices, and crystalline assemblies show that B\&B hypergraphs provide a unified, scalable, and information-efficient representation of structural organization, naturally capturing symmetry, modularity, and stereochemistry. This framework establishes a quantitative foundation for complexity-aware classification and inverse design of programmable matter.

Title: Anisotropic linear magnetoresistance in nanoflakes of Dirac semimetal NiTe2
Authors: Ding Bang Zhou, Kuang Hong Gao, Tie Lin, Yang Yang, Meng Fan Zhao, Zhi Yan Jia, Xiao Xia Hu, Qian Jin Guo, Zhi Qing Li
Abstract: This work investigates the magneto-transport properties of exfoliated NiTe2 nano-flakes with varying thicknesses and disorder levels, unveiling two distinct physical mechanisms governing the observed anisotropic linear magnetoresistance (MR). For the perpendicular magnetic field configuration, the well-defined linear MR in high fields is unambiguously attributed to a classical origin. This conclusion is supported by the proportionality between the MR slope and the carrier mobility, and between the crossover field and the inverse of mobility. In stark contrast, the linear MR under parallel magnetic fields exhibits a non-classical character. It shows a pronounced enhancement with decreasing flake thickness, which correlates with an increasing hole-to-electron concentration ratio. This distinctive thickness dependence suggests an origin in the nonlinear band effects near the Dirac point, likely driven by the shift of the Fermi level. Furthermore, the strengthening of MR anisotropic with enhanced inter-layer transport contradicts the prediction of the guiding-center diffusion model for three-dimensional systems. Our findings highlight the critical roles of band topology and structural dimensional in the anomalous magneto-transport of Dirac semi-metals.

Title: Lattice Translation Modulated Symmetries and TFTs
Authors: Ching-Yu Yao
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries that are not invariant under spacetime symmetry actions. We propose a general way to describe the lattice translation modulated symmetries in 1+1D, including the non-invertible ones, via the tensor network language. We demonstrate that the modulations can be described by some autoequivalences of the categories. Although the topological behaviors are broken because of the presence of modulations, we can still construct the modulated version of the symmetry TFT bulks by inserting a series of domain walls described by invertible bimodule categories. This structure not only recovers some known results on invertible modulated symmetries but also provides a general framework to tackle modulated symmetries in a more general setting.

Title: Heat measurement of quantum interference
Authors: Christoforus Dimas Satrya, Aleksandr S. Strelnikov, Luca Magazzù, Yu-Cheng Chang, Rishabh Upadhyay, Joonas T. Peltonen, Bayan Karimi, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Coherence is a key property of quantum systems, and it plays a central role in the operation and performance of quantum heat engines and refrigerators. Despite its importance for the fundamental understanding in quantum thermodynamics and its technological implications, coherence effects in heat transport have not been observed previously. Here, we measure quantum features in the heat transfer between a qubit and a thermal bath. The system is formed of a driven flux qubit galvanically coupled to a $\lambda/4$ coplanar-waveguide resonator that is coupled to a heat reservoir. This thermal bath is a normal-metal mesoscopic resistor, whose temperature can be measured and controlled. We detect interference patterns in the heat current due to driving-induced coherence. In particular, resonance peaks in the heat transferred to the bath are found at driving frequencies which are integer fractions of the resonator frequency. A selection rule on the even/odd parity of the peaks holds at the qubit symmetry point. We present a theoretical model based on Floquet theory that captures the experimental results. The studied system provides a platform for studying the role of coherence in quantum thermodynamics. Our work opens the possibility to demonstrate a true quantum thermal machine where heat is measured directly.

Abstract: Light polarization is one of the most fundamental features, equivalent to energy and coherence. Magnetism changes light polarization, and vice versa. The irradiation of intense circularly polarized femtosecond pules to magnetic materials can alter the magnetic orders and elementary excitations, particularly in the visible to infrared spectral regions. Furthermore, the recent development of x-ray free-electron laser enables the element-specific trace of the ultrafast dynamics with high time and spatial resolution. However, the light helicity of x-ray photons has not yet been used to control order parameters in condensed matter materials, not limited to such magnetic phenomenon. Here, we demonstrate the deterministic magnetization reversal of a ferromagnetic Pt/Co/Pt multilayer solely by irradiating femtosecond pulses of circularly polarized hard x-rays. The observed all-optical magnetization switching depends on the helicity of incident x-ray pulses and is strongly resonant with the photon energy at the Pt $L_3$ edge. These results originate in the x-ray magnetic circular dichroism of Pt, involving helicity-dependent excitation from the 2$p_{3/2}$ core level to the exchange-split 5$d$ valence states owing to the magnetic proximity effect with Co. These findings mark a new frontier for examining interactions between light and matter in the x-ray region.

Title: Topological Theory of Helium 4
Authors: Leonid Lantsman
Abstract: In this paper we attempt to construct the topological theory of superfluid helium $4$ in the framework of the (rigid) $U(1)$ model in which the initial $U(1)$ group is destroyed with appearance of (topologically nontrivial) domains separated by domain walls treated as step voltages between domains (e.g. with neighboring topological numbers). This can explain the superfluid properties in a helium $4$ specimen as well as the appearance of topologically nontrivial vortices therein.

Title: Arbitrary Control of Non-Hermitian Skin Modes via Disorder and An Electric Field
Authors: Zhao-Fan Cai, Yang Li, Yu-Ran Zhang, Xiaomin Wei, Zhongmin Yang, Tao Liu, Franco Nori
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), characterized by the accumulation of a macroscopic number of bulk states at system boundaries, is a hallmark of non-Hermitian physics. However, effective control of skin-mode localization in higher-dimensional systems remains a significant challenging. Here, we propose a versatile approach to manipulate the localization of skin modes in two-dimensional non-Hermitian lattices by combining disorder with a static electric field. While the electric field alone suppresses the NHSE in a clean system, the introduction of disorder induces transverse wave-packet transport perpendicular to the field. In nonreciprocal lattices, when the nonreciprocal hopping is misaligned with the electric field, the hopping component perpendicular to the field guides wave-packet propagation and produces boundary localization. By tuning the relative orientation between the electric field and the nonreciprocal hopping direction, the boundary localization position can be continuously and arbitrarily controlled. We further demonstrate distinct geometry-dependent manipulation of skin modes in reciprocal lattices, where controllable boundary localization emerges solely from the lattice geometry. These results establish a robust and tunable mechanism for engineering boundary accumulation and directed transport in non-Hermitian systems, offering new opportunities for applications in classical platforms and quantum materials.

Authors: Alban Degezelle, Jonas Strobelt, Sarah Loebner, Moussa Mebarki, Stephane Fusil, Vincent Garcia, Bruno Berini, Vincent Polewczyk, Yves Dumont, Sylvia Matzen, Philippe Lecoeur, Svetlana Santer, Thomas Maroutian
Abstract: Tailoring at will polar textures in ferroelectrics is critical for the development of nanoscale electronics and functional oxide technologies. Freestanding ferroelectric membranes have enabled studies of strain-induced polarization responses, but the control over membrane shape and local polarization typically remains limited to spontaneous buckling or uniaxial mechanical deformations. In this work, we employ a versatile photosensitive-polymer patterning approach to impose programmable bending strain profiles in ferroelectric membranes. Using BaTiO3 as a model system, we demonstrate deterministic 90° polarization rotation driven by engineered in-plane strain, and 180° polarization reversal arising from flexoelectric coupling through a controlled strain gradient. These results establish this programmable bending as a powerful approach to investigate strain-dependent domain structures, leverage flexoelectric effects, and engineer custom ferroelectric landscapes across a wide range of oxide membranes.

Title: Formation of Light-Emitting Defects in Ag-based Memristors
Authors: Diana Singh, Maciej Ćwierzona, Régis Parvaud, Sebastian Maćkowski, Alexandre Bouhelier
Abstract: Optical memristors are innovative devices that enable the integration of electro-optical functionalities - such as light modulation, multilevel optical memory, and nonvolatile reprogramming - into neuromorphic networks. Recently, their capabilities have expanded with the development of light-emitting memristors, which operate through various emission mechanisms. One notable process involves the electroluminescence of defects generated within the switching matrix during device activation. In this study, we explore the early-stage formation and evolution of the species responsible for light emission in Ag-based in-plane memristors. Our approach combines electrical stimulation with correlated optical electroluminescence and photoluminescence measurements. The findings provide valuable insights into controlling emission processes in memristors, paving the way for their integration as essential components in neuromorphic circuits.

Title: Hybrid Topological Defects in Ferroelectric Nematic Fluids
Authors: Shengzhu Yi, Chao Zhou, Zening Hong, Zhongjie Ma, Mingjun Huang, Satoshi Aya, Rui Zhang, Qi-Huo Wei
Abstract: Field theories predict that phase transitions sequentially breaking continuous and discrete symmetries can generate hybrid topological structures in which defects of different dimensionalities merge. We report experimental and numerical studies of hybrid defects in ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals, which undergo a cascaded transition from isotropic liquid to a high-symmetry apolar, and then to a low-symmetry polar nematic phase. By imposing surface anchoring to preset disclination configurations, we directly track the transformation of topological defects across the transition. We show that simple disclinations reproducibly evolve into complex hybrid states, including domain walls terminated by surface disclinations, domain walls decorated with monopoles, and merons-mediated boojums and monopoles. These results provide definitive experimental validation of hybrid defects in a soft matter system and establish ferroelectric nematics as a model platform for exploring and engineering polar defect structures.

Title: A Dimensionally Consistent Size-Strain Plot Method for Crystallite Size and Microstrain Estimation
Authors: Anand Pal
Abstract: X-ray diffraction (XRD) peak broadening analysis remains a cornerstone for quantifying crystallite size and lattice microstrain in materials. Among various approaches, the Size Strain Plot (SSP) method is widely employed for its conceptual simplicity and ease of use. However, this study reveals that the equation most commonly applied in SSP analysis is dimensionally inconsistent, a critical flaw that has gone largely unnoticed and replicated across decades of materials research. This pervasive error raises concerns about the validity of a significant body of published microstructural data. By tracing the historical origin of the misformulated equation, we demonstrate how a seemingly minor oversight evolved into a widely accepted standard practice within the field. We then present a dimensionally consistent formulation that restores physical meaning and analytical reliability to the SSP method. The corrected framework re-establishes the SSP approach as a robust and physically valid tool for XRD-based microstructural characterization. \en

Authors: Kirill Shulga, Shunsuke Nishimura, Pavel A. Volkov, Ryota Hasegawa, Miu Hirano, Takeyuki Tsuji, Takayuki Iwasaki, Mutsuko Hatano, Kento Sasaki, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: We demonstrate the detection and control of individual Abrikosov vortices in superconducting microwave resonators. $\lambda/4$ resonators with a narrowed region near the grounded end acting as a vortex trap were fabricated and studied using microwave transmission spectroscopy at millikelvin temperatures. Sharp stepwise drops in resonance frequency are detected as a function of increasing external magnetic field, attributed to the entry of individual Abrikosov vortices in the narrow region. This interpretation is confirmed by NV center magnetometry revealing discrete vortex entry events on increasing field. Our results establish a method to investigate and manipulate the states of Abrikosov vortices with microwaves.

Title: Competing Lattice and Defect Dynamics Govern Terahertz-Induced Ferroelectricity in Quantum Paraelectric SrTiO$_3$
Authors: L. Cheng, K. Hu, S. Yang, Yan Liang, Jiandi Zhang, J. Qi
Abstract: Intense terahertz (THz) pulses induce transient inversion-symmetry breaking in quantum paraelectric SrTiO$_3$, yet the underlying mechanism remains controversial. Using fields up to $\sim$1.1 MV/cm, we reveal spatially inhomogeneous THz-field-induced second harmonic generation (TFISH) governed by competing lattice and defect dynamics. Short-lived coherent antiferrodistortive (AFD) modes suppress dipole correlations within $\sim$5 ps, while heavily damped soft/AFD modes and a defect-induced low-frequency mode ($\sim$0.1-0.3 THz) jointly prevent long-range ferroelectric coherence in oxygen-vacancy-rich regions. Collective modes manifested by oscillatory TFISH components exhibit softening followed by hardening below a critical temperature $T^*\simeq$28 K, confirming transient ferroelectric order where defects are sparse. These results reconcile conflicting interpretations, establish defect-mediated competition as a central regulator of light-induced ferroelectricity, and open routes to ultrafast control of quantum materials.

Title: Onsager Condensation in Chiral Active Matter: Universality of Supersonic Topological Gas Dynamics
Authors: Magnus F Ivarsen
Abstract: To explain how dissipative active turbulence sustains inertial cascades, we construct a chiral model mapping overdamped agents to supersonic topological gas dynamics. Here, Mach cones function as acoustic horizons, shielding defect cores from the sound radiation of shallow water flows. We show that disorder activates a topological heat pump driving an inverse cascade toward a negative-temperature Onsager dipole, unless arrested into a vortex glass by insufficient dispersion. This mapping identifies a universality class unifying active swarms with the statistical mechanics of classical inviscid fluids.

Title: Revealing Nanoscale Molecular Organization in Liquid Crystals via Cryogenic Atom Probe Tomography
Authors: Kuan Meng, Kang'an Wang, Sebastian Eich, Pierre Nacke, Johanna R. Bruckner, Patrick Stender, Frank Giesselmann, Guido Schmitz
Abstract: While liquid crystals (LCs) have been extensively studied, obtaining a comprehensive nanoscale picture of their molecular organization remains challenging, as conventional techniques face an intrinsic trade-off between spatial and chemical resolution. Here, cryogenic atom probe tomography (cryo-APT) is introduced as a new analytical approach for LC materials, using 4'-Pentyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (5CB) and 4'-Octyl-4-cyanobiphenyl (8CB) as representative model compounds. This was enabled by a tailored cryogenic focused ion beam (cryo-FIB) protocol optimized for small organic molecules. The method enables controlled field evaporation of both intact molecules and diagnostic fragments, achieving over 90% molecular retention while preserving four characteristic dissociation patterns. By spatially correlating these fragmentation profiles with the local electric field derived from the tip geometry, we reveal field-directed dissociation pathways of CB molecules. In parallel, the distribution of intact molecular ions enables nanoscale visualization of material structure: we resolve homogeneous mixing of 5CB and 8CB in the nematic phase and directly observe the sub-nanometer crystalline layering in a supercooled 8CB sample, with contrast to the surrounding amorphous matrix suggesting the presence of a solid-liquid interface. This work establishes cryo-APT as a new powerful analytical platform for LC research and reveals its broad potential for application in soft matter systems.

Title: Double Perovskites K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 from First-Principles: Towards Efficient Materials for Green Energy
Authors: Ouendadji Salima, Aissani Ali, El Haj Hassan Fouad, Benahmedi Lakhdar
Abstract: The structural flexibility and multifunctional nature of double perovskite oxides make them attractive for applications requiring coupled optical, mechanical, and thermal performance. Using first-principles computations, this study examines the structural, electronic, elastic, optical, and thermoelectric stability of K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6. The two compounds combine to form a cubic double perovskite structure with ordered Nb$^{5+}$ and Ta$^{5+}$ cations. The calculated elastic constants satisfy the Born stability criteria, confirming mechanical stability; however, both K2NbTaO6 and Rb2NbTaO6 exhibit brittle behavior according to Pugh's ratio, reflecting limited ductility. Semiconducting behavior is revealed by band structure analysis with energy gaps of 2.79 eV for K2NbTaO6 and 2.63 eV for Rb2NbTaO6. Optical spectra show noticeable absorption in the high-energy region near the UV, indicating relevance for theoretical studies of optoelectronic and photocatalytic processes, without implying practical device efficiency.

Title: Evolution of Correlated Electrons in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ at Ambient Pressure: a Study of Double-Counting Effect
Authors: Zhong-Yi Xie, Zhihui Luo, Wéi Wú, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: We employ cluster extension of dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT) to systematically investigate the impact of double counting corrections on the correlated electronic structure of ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ under ambient pressure. By adjusting double-counting parameters, while maintaining a fixed Fermi surface, we observe a pronounced orbital-selective density of states change: the $d_{z^2}$ orbital undergoes significant variation near the Fermi level with increasing $E_{dc}^z$, while the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital remains essentially unchanged throughout the entire range. Analysis of renormalization factor show the monotonic dependence with double counting in both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital, and it also identifies an optimal double counting window in $d_{z^2}$ orbital aligns with experimental values. We also find the interlayer Matsubara self energy exhibits non-monotonic dependence on $E_{dc}^z$, deviating from theoretical predictions. This anomaly is attributed to the metallization of oxygen-bridged pathways, which disrupts the prerequisite for charge transfer via apical oxygen. Our results establish $E_{dc}$ as a critical control parameter for correlated electronic structure in ${\rm La_3Ni_2O_7}$ and provide a computational framework for resolving orbital-dependent correlation effects in layered materials.

Title: Balancing information and dissipation with partially observed fluctuating signals
Authors: Giorgio Nicoletti, Ivan Di Terlizzi, Daniel Maria Busiello
Abstract: Biological systems sense and extract information from fluctuating signals while operating under energetic constraints and limited resolution. We introduce a general chemical model in which a sensor, coupled to a signaling pathway activated by hidden signals, can allosterically tune the production of a readout molecule. We propose viable strategies for the sensor to estimate, and eventually balance, information gathering on the hidden process and the associated dissipative cost relying solely on counting statistics of observed trajectories. We show that these strategies can be successfully implemented to adapt the readout production even with finite-time measurements and limited dynamic resolution, and remain effective in the presence of inhibitory regulatory mechanisms. Our study provides a plausible mechanism to actively balance information and dissipation, paving the way for an implementable design principle underpinning biological and biochemical adaptation.

Title: Optical Readout of Reconfigurable Layered Magnetic Domain Structure in CrSBr

Abstract: The emergence of intelligent matter has sparked significant interest in next generation technologies. We report on the discovery of a reconfigurable magnetic multilayer domain structure in the van der Waals magnet CrSBr, exhibiting a unique combination of magnetic and optical properties. Applying an external magnetic field along the easy axis drives the hysteretic antiferromagnetic-to-ferromagnetic transition that is not universally binary, but instead develops through a cascade of intermediate magnetic configurations whose multiplicity and stability scale systematically with thickness. This material can be considered as a prototypical intelligent matter, capable of encoding, processing, and storing information through its tunable magnetic structure. The directly linked optical properties of CrSBr, modulated by the magnetic structure, provide a readout mechanism for the stored information compatible with modern information distribution using light. With its adaptive properties, CrSBr is an attractive candidate for neuromorphic circuitries, enabling the design of brain-inspired computing architectures that can learn and evolve in response to changing environments.

Title: Thermal stability originates the vanishing of the specific heats at the absolute zero
Authors: Martín-Olalla, José María
Abstract: The relationship between the vanishing of the heat capacities as $T\to0^+$ and the thermal stability is examined. The heat capacities vanish as fast as or faster than $T$ as $T\to0^+$ for states at the phase space boundary ($T=0$) to sustain the standard thermal stability criterion $U_{ss}>0$. Conversely, weakly vanishing heat capacities, which signify a loss of curvature in $U(S)$ at $T=0$, are the signature of a critical condition precisely at $T=0$, as exemplified in marginal Fermi liquids. Therefore, the vanishing of the specific heat should be viewed not as a new law but as a confirmatory result of the existing framework of thermodynamics.

Title: Revealing interstitial energetics in Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy via universal machine learning interatomic potentials
Authors: Miroslav Lebeda, Jan Drahokoupil, Veronika Mazáčová, Petr Vlčák
Abstract: Understanding the behavior of light interstitial elements in multicomponent alloys remains challenging due to the complexity of local chemical environments and the high computational cost of first-principles calculations. Here we demonstrate that three universal machine-learning interatomic potentials (uMLIPs) - MACE-MATPES-PBE-0, Orb-v3, and SevenNet-0 can efficiently map the energetics of C, N, O, and H interstitials in a Ti-23Nb-0.7Ta-2Zr gum metal base alloy while being several orders of magnitude faster than density functional theory (DFT). All uMLIPs predict broad energy distributions (1-3 eV) for all four interstitial elements, reflecting their strong sensitivity to local lattice chemistry. Despite alloy disorder, MACE-MATPES-PBE-0 and Orb-v3 reproduce the expected site preferences of the bcc structure: C, N, and O relax into octahedral sites, whereas H stabilizes in tetrahedral positions. In contrast, SevenNet-0 predicts H to be most stable in octahedral coordination, indicating a limitation of this model. Correlation analysis reveals two dominant chemical trends: Ti-rich environments strongly stabilize interstitials, whereas close proximity to Nb is destabilizing; Zr and Ta show no statistically significant influence, likely due to their low concentrations. Benchmarking representative O interstitial configurations against DFT confirms that the uMLIPs reasonably reproduce the energetic ordering of chemically distinct environments. Overall, these results demonstrate that uMLIPs enable computationally efficient, statistically converged characterization of defect energetics in gum metal base alloy and provide insight into how local chemical environments govern interstitial stability.

Title: Boltzmann transport theory of magnon-exciton drag
Authors: Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Akashdeep Kamra, Mikhail M. Glazov
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of magnon-exciton drag effect in a bilayer van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Effective exciton-magnon coupling arises from an orbital mechanism: Magnons tilt the layer magnetizations, enabling charge carrier tunneling that mixes intra- and interlayer excitons and thereby modulate the exciton energy. We derive the effective Hamiltonian of exciton-magnon coupling, based on our calculation of the magnon spectrum taking into account short-range exchange interaction between Cr-ion spins, single-ion anisotropy, and long-range dipole-dipole interactions. The latter produces a negative group velocity of magnons at small wavevectors. We show that despite rather small renormalization of exciton's energy and effective mass by the exciton-magnon interaction, the three key two-magnon processes: exciton-magnon scattering, two-magnon absorption by exciton, and two-magnon emission are highly efficient. By solving the Boltzmann kinetic equation, we evaluate short exciton-magnon scattering time which is in the sub-ps range and strongly decreases with the increase of magnon population. Hence, exciton-magnon scattering is likely to be dominant over other scattering processes related to the exciton-phonon and exciton-disorder interactions. We demonstrate that magnons can efficiently drag excitons, resulting in a large and nearly isotropic exciton propagation that can significantly exceed the intrinsic anisotropic diffusion. Our results provide a theoretical basis for recent observations of anomalous exciton transport in CrSBr [F. Dirnberger, et al., Nat. Nano. (2025)] and establish magnon-exciton drag as a powerful mechanism for controlling exciton propagation in magnetic systems.

Title: A Robust Large-Period Discrete Time Crystal and its Signature in a Digital Quantum Computer
Authors: Tianqi Chen, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee, Bo Yang, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Discrete time crystals (DTCs) are novel out-of-equilibrium quantum states of matter which break time translational symmetry. DTCs have been extensively realized in experiments, particularly their subclass that is characterized by period-doubling dynamics due to its natural occurrence in a system of periodically driven two-level, e.g., spin-1/2, particles. The realization of DTCs beyond period-doubling, including their generalizations termed discrete quasicrystals has also been made in recent years, though such experiments typically involve higher spin particles. Constructing and observing DTCs beyond period-doubling in systems of two-level particles are generally still considered an open challenge due to the latter's $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry that natively only leads to period-doubling. In this work, we developed an intuitive interacting system of two-level particles (qubits) that supports the more non-trivial period-quadrupling DTCs ($4T$-DTCs). Remarkably, by utilizing a variational algorithm, we are able to observe clear signatures of such $4T$-DTCs in a quantum processor despite the presence of considerable noise and the small number of available qubits. Our findings extend the landscape of time crystalline behavior by demonstrating a distinct realization of time crystallinity beyond standard period-doubling dynamics with qubits (two-level particles) on a NISQ-era digital quantum computer, as well as the potential of existing noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices for simulating exotic non-equilibrium quantum states of matter.

Title: Preparing matrix product states via fusion: constraints and extensions
Authors: David T. Stephen, Oliver Hart
Abstract: In the era of noisy, intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices, the efficient preparation of many-body resource states is a task of paramount importance. In this paper we focus on the deterministic preparation of matrix-product states (MPS) in constant depth by utilizing measurements and classical communication to fuse smaller states into larger ones. We place strong constraints on the MPS that can be prepared using this method, which we refer to as MPS fusion. Namely, we establish that it is necessary for the MPS to have a flat entanglement spectrum. Using the recently introduced split-index MPS (SIMPS) representation, we then introduce a family of states that belong to interesting phases of matter protected by non-onsite symmetries, including anomalous and non-invertible symmetries, and also serve as resources for long-range quantum teleportation, but which lie beyond the scope of ordinary MPS fusion. It is shown constructively that these states can be prepared in constant depth using a broader class of measurement-assisted protocols, which we dub SIMPS fusion. Even in cases when MPS fusion is possible, using SIMPS fusion can give rise to significantly reduced resource overhead. We also discuss constraints on SIMPS fusion and propose a general framework for fusion that encompasses the MPS and SIMPS protocols. Our results therefore simultaneously establish the boundaries of conventional MPS fusion and push the envelope of which states can be prepared using measurement-assisted protocols.

Title: Non-Abelian Self-Correcting Quantum Memory and Transversal Non-Clifford Gate beyond the $n^{1/3}$ Distance Barrier
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We construct a family of infinitely many new candidate non-Abelian self-correcting topological quantum memories in $D\geq 5+1$ spacetime dimensions without particle excitations using local commuting non-Pauli stabilizer lattice models and field theories of $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ higher-form gauge fields with nontrivial topological action. We call such non-Pauli stabilizer models magic stabilizer codes. The family of topological orders have Abelian electric excitations and non-Abelian magnetic excitations that obey Ising-like fusion rules and non-Abelian braiding, including Borromean ring type braiding which is a signature of non-Abelian topological order, generalizing the dihedral group $\mathbb{D}_8$ gauge theory in (2+1)D. The simplest example includes a new non-Abelian self-correcting memory in (5+1)D with Abelian loop excitations and non-Abelian membrane excitations. We prove the self-correction property and the thermal stability, and devise a probabilistic local cellular-automaton decoder. We also construct fault-tolerant non-Clifford CCZ logical gate using constant depth circuit from higher cup products in the 5D non-Abelian code. The use of higher-cup products and non-Pauli stabilizers allows us to get an $O(n^{2/5})$ distance overcoming the $O(n^{1/3})$ distance barrier in conventional topological stabilizer codes, including the 3D color code and the 6D self-correcting color code.

Title: Fast training and sampling of Restricted Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Nicolas Béreux, Aurélien Decelle, Cyril Furtlehner, Lorenzo Rosset, Beatriz Seoane
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) are powerful tools for modeling complex systems and extracting insights from data, but their training is hindered by the slow mixing of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) processes, especially with highly structured datasets. In this study, we build on recent theoretical advances in RBM training and focus on the stepwise encoding of data patterns into singular vectors of the coupling matrix, significantly reducing the cost of generating new samples and evaluating the quality of the model, as well as the training cost in highly clustered datasets. The learning process is analogous to the thermodynamic continuous phase transitions observed in ferromagnetic models, where new modes in the probability measure emerge in a continuous manner. We leverage the continuous transitions in the training process to define a smooth annealing trajectory that enables reliable and computationally efficient log-likelihood estimates. This approach enables online assessment during training and introduces a novel sampling strategy called Parallel Trajectory Tempering (PTT) that outperforms previously optimized MCMC methods. To mitigate the critical slowdown effect in the early stages of training, we propose a pre-training phase. In this phase, the principal components are encoded into a low-rank RBM through a convex optimization process, facilitating efficient static Monte Carlo sampling and accurate computation of the partition function. Our results demonstrate that this pre-training strategy allows RBMs to efficiently handle highly structured datasets where conventional methods fail. Additionally, our log-likelihood estimation outperforms computationally intensive approaches in controlled scenarios, while the PTT algorithm significantly accelerates MCMC processes compared to conventional methods.

Title: A Methodology for Process Design Kit Re-Centering Using TCAD and Experimental Data for Cryogenic Temperatures
Authors: Tapas Dutta, Fikru Adamu-Lema, Djamel Bensouiah, Asen Asenov
Abstract: In this work, we describe and demonstrate a novel Technology Computer Aided Design (TCAD) driven methodology to re-center room-temperature Process Design Kits (PDKs) for cryogenic operation using a limited set of experimental measurements. Unlike previous approaches that relied on direct fitting of sparse measurements, our technique accounts for process-induced deviations by calibrating TCAD models to both room-temperature and cryogenic data. Compact models for all process corners are extracted from TCAD-generated target characteristics, enabling accurate cryogenic modeling without dedicated foundry support. This scalable, technology-independent method provides a practical path for cryogenic circuit design.

Title: Observation of quantum free fall and the consistency with the equivalence principle
Authors: Or Dobkowski, Barak Trok, Peter Skakunenko, Yonathan Japha, David Groswasser, Maxim Efremov, Chiara Marletto, Ivette Fuentes, Roger Penrose, Vlatko Vedral, Wolfgang P. Schleich, Ron Folman
Abstract: The unification of quantum theory and the general theory of relativity - describing gravity, is one of the most important challenges in science. Einstein's general theory of relativity is based on the principle of equivalence, and has been confirmed to great accuracy for large bodies. However, in the quantum domain the equivalence principle has been predicted to take a unique form involving a gauge phase, equal to the quantum phase of a free-falling object. To measure this phase, we realize a novel cold-atom interferometer in which one wave-packet stays static in the laboratory frame while the other is in free fall. The observed relative-phase of the wave-packets confirms the predicted phase of a free-falling object, and shows that in our low energy regime, the equivalence principle may be applied to the quantum domain. Our observation constitutes a fundamental test of the interface between quantum theory and gravity. The new interferometer also opens the door for further probing of the latter interface, as well as to searches for new physics.

Title: Non-Hermitian Linear Electro-Optic Effect Through Interactions of Free and Bound Charges
Authors: Sylvain Lannebère, Nader Engheta, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: In recent years, there has been growing interest in non-Hermitian phenomena in low-symmetry conductors, particularly optical gain driven by electro-optic effects. Conventional semiclassical treatments typically attribute these effects to nonlinear interactions associated with the anomalous velocity of Bloch electrons. Here, we present a phenomenological microscopic model that not only recovers these anomalous-velocity contributions, but also incorporates interband effects that become significant at higher frequencies. Our model captures a wide range of nonlinear interactions while remaining consistent with passivity and microscopic reversibility. Using this broader framework, we study the nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons as an alternative mechanism for optical gain. We show that, under non-equilibrium conditions in low-symmetry conductors, the linearized electromagnetic response can exhibit both nonreciprocity and gain, even without anomalous velocity contributions. Finally, we analyze the stability of electrically biased systems and highlight potential applications such as optical isolators and traveling-wave amplifiers.

Title: Flexible BiSel/NiO-based X-ray synapses bridging the functions of detection and memory
Authors: Qiao Wang, Pengfei Li, Yushou Song, Jalu Li, Haiying Xiao, Yuqing Wang, Guoliang Ma, Hsu-Sheng Tsai, Ping-An Hu
Abstract: Currently, the X-ray detectors are widely used in medical imaging, industrial inspection, aerospace, and other fields, as the market demand for high-efficiency, flexible, and low-power detectors is increased. Although the traditional inorganic X-ray detection materials have achieved great success and effectiveness, they have their own limitations and let alone flexibility/bendability and memory function. In this study, we present the design of a BiSeI/NiO-based X-ray synaptic detector and its application in the simulation of biological synaptic processes. Herein, the BiSeI, a quasi-1D inorganic semiconductor, stands out as an ideal choice for the X-ray detectors, especially for flexible and portable devices due to its large atomic number, large photoelectric absorption coefficient, and mechanical plasticity. Meanwhile, the NiO-based materials provide the memory function required for the intelligent detection systems. Moreover, our devices offer notable advantages in terms of low power consumption, compared with traditional X-ray detectors. The BiSeI/NiO detectors demonstrate advanced features with an ultrahigh sensitivity, an ultralow detection limit, and include the paired-pulse facilitation (PPF) and the transition from short- to long-term memory, maintaining the functionality on flexible substrates. This design represents a significant step toward the development of intelligent and flexible X-ray detectors.

Title: Perturbative distinguishability of black hole microstates from AdS/CFT correspondence
Authors: Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: We establish direct evidence for the perturbative distinguishability between black hole microstates and thermal states using the AdS/CFT correspondence. In two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories, we obtain the subsystem fidelity and quantum Jensen-Shannon divergence, both of which provide rigorous lower and upper bounds for subsystem trace distance. This result demonstrates that perturbative quantum gravity corrections break semiclassical indistinguishability, thereby supporting the recovery of information even from a small amount of the Hawking radiation.

Title: $N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d
Authors: Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.

Title: Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition
Authors: Zikang Ge, Jinhao Hu, Shengyuan Peng, Wei Kang, Xiaofei Shen, Yanbo Xie, Jianming Xue
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond this http URL extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.

Title: Loss of integrability in a system with two-photon interactions
Authors: Fabrizio Ramírez, David Villaseñor, Viani S. Morales-Guzmán, Darly Y. Castro, Jorge G. Hirsch
Abstract: Light-matter systems that exhibit two-photon interactions have emerged as powerful platforms for exploring quantum applications. In this work, we focus on the two-photon Dicke model, a system of significant experimental relevance that displays spectral collapse and undergoes a phase transition from a normal to a superradiant phase. We analyze the normal phase, where a classical limit with two degrees of freedom can be derived using a mean-field approximation. Our study presents a detailed investigation of the loss of integrability in the two-photon Dicke model, employing both quantum and classical diagnostics. These results allow us to explore various dynamical features of the system, including the onset of chaos and the existence of mixed phase-space behavior.

Title: Continuous-time parametrization of neural quantum states for quantum dynamics
Authors: Dingzu Wang, Wenxuan Zhang, Xiansong Xu, Dario Poletti
Abstract: Neural quantum states are a promising framework for simulating many-body quantum dynamics, as they can represent states with volume-law entanglement. As time evolves, the neural network parameters are typically optimized at discrete time steps to approximate the wave function at each point in time. Given the differentiability of the wave function stemming from the Schrödinger equation, here we impose a time-continuous and differentiable parameterization of the neural network by expressing its parameters as linear combinations of temporal basis functions with trainable, time-independent coefficients. We test this ansatz, referred to as the smooth neural quantum state (\textit{s}-NQS) with a loss function defined over an extended time interval, under a sudden quench of a non-integrable many-body quantum spin chain. We demonstrate accurate time evolution using a restricted Boltzmann machine as the instantaneous neural network architecture. We show that the parameterization enables accurate simulations with fewer variational parameters, independent of time-step resolution. Furthermore, the smooth neural quantum state also allows us to initialize and evaluate the wave function at times not included in the training set, both within and beyond the training interval.

Title: How to simulate Lévy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme
Authors: Ilya Pavlyukevich, Olga Aryasova, Alexei Chechkin, Oleksii Kulyk
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed Lévy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions. In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions. This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of Lévy flights in steep potential landscapes.

Title: Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems
Authors: Moritz Flaschel, Denisa Martonová, Carina Veil, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.

Title: Speeding up Pontus-Mpemba effects via dynamical phase transitions
Authors: Andrea Nava, Reinhold Egger, Bidyut Dey, Domenico Giuliano
Abstract: We demonstrate that open quantum systems exhibiting dynamical phase transitions (DPTs) allow for efficient protocols implementing the Pontus-Mpemba effect. The relaxation speed-up toward a predesignated target state is tied to the existence of a long metastable time window preceding the DPT and can be exploited in applications to systematically optimize quantum protocols. As paradigmatic example for the connection between DPTs and quantum Mpemba effects, we study one-dimensional (1D) interacting lattice fermions corresponding to a dissipative variant of the Gross-Neveu (GN) model.

Title: Witt Groups and Bulk-Boundary Correspondence for Stabilizer States
Authors: Błażej Ruba, Bowen Yang
Abstract: We establish a bulk--boundary correspondence for translation-invariant stabilizer states in arbitrary spatial dimension, formulated in the framework of modules over Laurent polynomial rings. To each stabilizer state restricted to half-space geometry we associate a boundary operator module. Boundary operator modules provide examples of quasi-symplectic modules, which are objects of independent mathematical interest. In their study, we use ideas from algebraic L-theory in a setting involving non-projective modules and non-unimodular forms. Our results about quasi-symplectic modules in one spatial dimension allow us to resolve the conjecture that every stabilizer state in two dimensions is characterized by a corresponding abelian anyon model with gappable boundary. Our techniques are also applicable beyond two dimensions, such as in the study of fractons.

Title: Where Non-Invertible Symmetries End: Twist Defects for Electromagnetic Duality
Authors: Shu-Heng Shao, Siwei Zhong
Abstract: We study novel conformal twist defects in 4d Maxwell theory, around which electric and magnetic fields are exchanged. These are codimension-2 defects living at the end of topological defects for certain non-invertible global symmetries. We determine the operator spectrum of the twist defect by solving classical electromagnetic wave equations subject to a twisted boundary condition. Using techniques from defect CFT, we show that correlation functions of these defect operators factorize into two sectors: a universal generalized free-field sector, and a chiral current sector analogous to edge modes in Chern-Simons theory. In a similar setup, we also revisit the twist fields attached to non-invertible line defects in the 2d compact boson CFT. We discuss a defect 't Hooft anomaly involving a chiral $O(2)$ symmetry, highlighting its dynamical implications.

Title: Learning from the electronic structure of molecules across the periodic table
Authors: Manasa Kaniselvan, Benjamin Kurt Miller, Meng Gao, Juno Nam, Daniel S. Levine
Abstract: Machine-Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIPs) require vast amounts of atomic structure data to learn forces and energies, and their performance continues to improve with training set size. Meanwhile, the even greater quantities of accompanying data in the Hamiltonian matrix H behind these datasets has so far gone unused for this purpose. Here, we provide a recipe for integrating the orbital interaction data within H towards training pipelines for atomic-level properties. We first introduce HELM ("Hamiltonian-trained Electronic-structure Learning for Molecules"), a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian prediction model which bridges the gap between Hamiltonian prediction and universal MLIPs by scaling to H of structures with 100+ atoms, high elemental diversity, and large basis sets including diffuse functions. To accompany HELM, we release a curated Hamiltonian matrix dataset, 'OMol_CSH_58k', with unprecedented elemental diversity (58 elements), molecular size (up to 150 atoms), and basis set (def2-TZVPD). Finally, we introduce 'Hamiltonian pretraining' as a method to extract meaningful descriptors of atomic environments even from a limited number atomic structures, and repurpose this shared embedding space to improve performance on energy-prediction in low-data regimes. Our results highlight the use of electronic interactions as a rich and transferable data source for representing chemical space.

Title: Perturbation-assisted Observation of the Lowest Vibrational Level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}Π_{0}$ State of Ultracold LiK Molecules
Authors: Anbang Yang, Xiaoyu Nie, Hao Lin Yu, Yiming Liu, Victor Avalos, Canming He, Jacek Klos, Svetlana Kotochigova, Kai Dieckmann
Abstract: The narrow transition from the lowest rovibrational level of the $\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ electronic ground state to the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ potential provides opportunities for achieving magic-wavelength trapping of ultracold bialkali molecules for enhancing their rotational coherence times. Guided by existing spectroscopic data of several perturbed and deeply-bound rovibrational states of the $\mathrm{A}^{1}\Sigma^{+}$ potential [Grochola et al., Chem. Phys. Lett., 2012, 535, 17-20], we conducted a targeted spectroscopic search and report the first observation of the lowest vibrational level of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state in $^{6}\mathrm{Li}^{40}\mathrm{K}$. The transition frequency from $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},\,v=0,\,J=0>$ to $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0,\,J'=1>$ is determined to be 314,230.5(5)GHz. Assisted by microwave spectroscopy, we resolved the rotational structure of $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},\,v'=0>$ and extracted a rotational constant of $h\times8.576(44)$ GHz for the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ state. From this, we deducted an energy separation between $|\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0},v'=0,J'=0>$ and $|\mathrm{X}^{1}\Sigma^{+},v=0,J=0>$ of $hc\times$10,481.03(2) $\mathrm{cm}^{-1}$. Our work provides timely and precise information on the deeply-bound region of the $\mathrm{b}^{3}\Pi_{0}$ triplet excited potential of LiK, and benefits future applications of ultracold LiK isotopologues in quantum simulation and quantum computation that demand long coherence times.

Title: Water wave scattering by a surface-mounted rectangular anisotropic elastic plate
Authors: Ben Wilks, Michael H. Meylan, Zachary J. Wegert, Vivien J. Challis, Ngamta Thamwattana
Abstract: This paper considers the problem of water wave scattering by a rectangular anisotropic elastic plate mounted on the ocean surface, with either free or clamped edges. The problem is obtained as an expansion over the dry modes of the elastic plate, which are computed using a Rayleigh--Ritz method. In turn, the component diffraction and radiation problems are solved by formulating a boundary integral equation and solving numerically using a constant panel method. The results are presented to highlight the resonant responses of the plate under different forcing scenarios. In particular, we illustrate how the excitation of certain modes can be forbidden due to symmetry.

Title: A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on a Catenoid
Authors: Khushi Banthia, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.

Title: Mixed-State Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions in Imaginary-Time Dynamics
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zenan Liu, Xu Tian, Zhe Wang, Yanzhang Zhu, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Mixed-state phase transitions have recently attracted growing attention as a new frontier in nonequilibrium quantum matter and quantum information. In this work, we introduce the measurement-dressed imaginary-time evolution (MDITE) as a novel framework to explore mixed-state quantum phases and decoherence-driven criticality. In this setup, alternating imaginary-time evolution and projective measurements generate a competition between coherence-restoring dynamics and decoherence-inducing events. While reminiscent of monitored unitary circuits, MDITE fundamentally differs in that the physics is encoded in decoherent mixed states rather than in quantum trajectories. We demonstrate that this interplay gives rise to a novel class of mixed-state phase transitions, using numerical simulations of the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional columnar dimerized Heisenberg model. Notably, the observed transitions do not fall into any previously established universality classes. Furthermore, we provide a diagrammatic representation of the evolving state, which naturally enables efficient studies of MDITE with quantum Monte Carlo and other many-body numerical methods, thereby extending investigations of mixed-state phase transitions to large-scale and higher-dimensional systems. In addition, the representation provides a natural interpretation of the phase transitions in terms of cluster formation within the simulations. Our results highlight MDITE as a powerful paradigm for investigating non-unitary dynamics and the fundamental role of decoherence in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Linearized instability of Couette flow in stress-power law fluids
Authors: Krishna Kaushik Yanamundra (1), Lorenzo Fusi (2) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, Texas A&amp;M University, College Station, TX, USA, (2) Dipartimento di Matematica e Informatica "U. Dini'', Università degli Studi di Firenze, 50134, Firenze, Italy)
Abstract: This paper examines the linearized stability of plane Couette flow for stress-power law fluids, which exhibit non-monotonic stress-strain rate behavior. The constitutive model is derived from a thermodynamic framework using a non-convex rate of dissipation potential. Under velocity boundary conditions, the system may admit three steady-state solutions. Linearized stability analysis reveals that the two solutions on ascending constitutive branches are unconditionally stable, while the solution on the descending branch is unconditionally unstable. For mixed traction-velocity boundary conditions, the base state is unique. Stability depends solely on whether the prescribed traction lies on an ascending (stable) or descending (unstable) branch of the constitutive curve. The results demonstrate that flow stability in these complex fluids is fundamentally governed by both boundary conditions and constitutive non-monotonicity.

Title: On-Chip Levitated Neon Particle Arrays for Robust and Scalable Electron Qubits
Authors: Sosuke Inui, Yinghe Qi, Yiming Xing, Charles Peretti, Dafei Jin, Wei Guo
Abstract: Electron-on-neon (eNe) qubits have recently emerged as a compelling platform for quantum computing, which combines the vacuum isolation advantages of trapped-ion qubits with the scalability of superconducting circuits. In this system, electrons are trapped in vacuum above a solid neon film deposited on superconducting microwave resonators, where they exhibit strong coupling to the resonators, coherence times of ~0.1 ms, and single-qubit gate fidelities exceeding 99.97%. A central challenge, however, is the spontaneous binding of electrons to neon surface bumps. These bumps, originating from substrate roughness, vary in size: electrons on bumps of suitable sizes within the resonator can couple to microwave photons and function as qubits, whereas those on unfavorable bumps remain inactive yet contribute to background charge noise. Moreover, both the bump landscape and the sites where electrons bind differ from run to run, leading to variable qubit characteristics that hinder scalability. To address this challenging issue, we present an on-chip magnetic-levitation architecture in which arrays of solid-neon microparticles are suspended above the processor chip to act as electron carriers. This design eliminates substrate effects while retaining strong qubit-resonator coupling and supporting inter-qubit connectivity. Our analysis further shows that the qubit transition frequency can be tuned across the gigahertz range and its anharmonicity can reach ~0.8 GHz by tuning the resonator bias voltage. Together, these features suggest a promising pathway toward robust, reproducible, and scalable eNe-based quantum computing.

Title: Polylogarithmic-Depth Quantum Algorithm for Simulating the Extended Hubbard Model on a Two-Dimensional Lattice Using the Fast Multipole Method
Authors: Yu Wang, Martina Nibbi, Maxine Luo, Isabel Nha Minh Le, Yanbin Chen, J. Ignacio Cirac, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The extended Hubbard model on a two-dimensional lattice captures key physical phenomena, but is challenging to simulate due to the presence of long-range interactions. In this work, we present an efficient quantum algorithm for simulating the time evolution of this model. Our approach, inspired by the fast multipole method, approximates pairwise interactions by interactions between hierarchical levels of coarse-graining boxes. We discuss how to leverage recent advances in two-dimensional neutral atom quantum computing, supporting non-local operations such as long-range gates and shuttling. The resulting circuit depth for a single Trotter step scales polylogarithmically with system size.
