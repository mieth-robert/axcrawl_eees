Title: Landau theory of CeCoSi
Authors: Takayuki Ishitobi
Abstract: We investigate both the nonmagnetic and magnetic ordered phases of CeCoSi using Landau theory. Our analysis predicts that three successive phase transitions occur at zero magnetic field. In the intermediate phase, an out-of-plane magnetic moment may be present or absent. If present, magnetic fields applied along the [100] and [110] directions induce additional magnetic phases.

Title: Superzone gap formation induced by ferroic orders
Authors: Takayuki Ishitobi
Abstract: We demonstrate that a superzone gap, typically associated with antiferroic ordering, can also emerge from ferroic orders in systems with sublattice degrees of freedom. By analyzing a $p$-orbital tight-binding model on a zigzag chain, we show that a Su--Schrieffer--Heeger-type gap is induced by ferroquadrupolar or ferromagnetic order or by applying an external magnetic field.

Abstract: The topological gap protocol (TGP) is a statistical test designed to identify a topological phase with high confidence and without human bias. It is used to determine a promising parameter regime for operating topological qubits. The protocol's key metric is the probability of incorrectly identifying a trivial region as topological, referred to as the false discovery rate (FDR). Two recent manuscripts [arXiv:2502.19560, arXiv:2503.08944] engage with the topological gap protocol and its use in Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Subsection S4.3 of the Supplementary Information for Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), although they do not explicitly dispute the main results of either one. We demonstrate that the objections in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944 are unfounded, and we uphold the conclusions of Phys. Rev. B 107, 245423 (2023) and Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). Specifically, we show that no flaws have been identified in our estimate of the false discovery rate (FDR). We provide a point-by-point rebuttal of the comments in arXiv:2502.19560 and arXiv:2503.08944.

Title: Torsional Hall Viscosity of Massive Chern Insulators: Magnetic Field and Momentum Deformations
Authors: Ioannis Matthaiakakis, Weizhen Jia, Raffael L. Klees, David Rodríguez Fernández, Zhuo-Yu Xian, René Meyer, Johanna Erdmenger, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz
Abstract: This work focuses on the non-dissipative, parity-odd spin transport of (2 + 1)-dimensional relativistic electrons, generated by torsion, and the torsional Hall viscosity $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$. We first determine $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ for massive Dirac fermions in the presence of a constant electromagnetic field. We predict that the magnetic field induces a contribution to $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ competing with the one originating from the Dirac mass. Moreover, we quantify the impact on $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ originating from the band structure deformation quadratic in momentum terms that was proposed by Bernevig-Hughes-Zhang (BHZ). We find that the BHZ deformation enhances $\zeta_{\mathrm{H}}$ in magnitude, but reverses its sign as compared to the standard massive Dirac fermion, indicating a Hall response in opposite direction to the typical Hall viscous force. Nevertheless, the torsional Hall viscosity still discriminates between topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes. Our results, hence, pave the way for a deeper understanding of hydrodynamic spin transport and its possible verification in experiments.

Title: Universal non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states and density-dependent thermalization in Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Rishik Perugu, Arijit Haldar, Sumilan Banerjee
Abstract: Non-equilibrium dynamics of unentangled and entangled pure states in interacting quantum systems is crucial for harnessing quantum information and to understand quantum thermalization. We develop a general Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) field theory for non-equilibrium dynamics of pure states of fermions. We apply our formalism to study the time evolution of initial density inhomogeneity and multi-point correlations of pure states in the complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) models. We demonstrate a remarkable universality in the dynamics of pure states in the SYK model. We show that dynamics of almost all pure states in a fixed particle number sector is solely determined by a set of universal large-$N$ Kadanoff-Baym equations. Moreover, irrespective of the initial state the site- and disorder-averaged Green's function thermalizes instantaneously, whereas local and non-local Green's functions have finite thermalization rate. We support our large-$N$ results through random-matrix theory (RMT) analysis. Furthermore, we show that the thermalization of an initial pure product state in the non-interacting SYK$_2$ model is independent of fermion filling and an initial density inhomogeneity decays with weak but long lived oscillations due to dephasing. In contrast, the interacting SYK$_{q\geq 4}$ model thermalizes slower than the non-interacting model and exhibits filling-dependent monotonic relaxation of initial inhomogeneity. For evolution of entangled pure states, we show that the initial entanglement is encoded in the non-local and/or multi-point quantum correlations that relax as the system thermalizes.

Title: Novel phenomena in transition-metal oxide thin films and heterostructures with strong correlations and spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Satoshi Okamoto, Narayan Mohanta, Ho Nyung Lee, Adriana Moreo, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Transition-metal oxides have been a central subject of condensed matter physics for decades. In addition to novel electronic states driven by the influence of strong correlation, relativistic spin-orbit coupling effects have recently attracted much attention for their potential to explore topological phenomena. In this article, we review various experimental and theoretical studies on transition-metal oxides with focus on thin films and heterostructures where their physics is much influenced by correlation effects and spin-orbit coupling. The combination of the heterostructure geometry together with correlation and topology leads to a variety of novel states here reviewed. We also discuss perspectives for future research in this broad promising area.

Title: Increasing Downshifting Luminescence Intensity Through an Extended Active Layer
Authors: Miao Liu, Jinyang Liang, Fiorenzo Vetrone
Abstract: The near-infrared (NIR) emission of rare-earth doped nanoparticles (RENPs), known as downshifting luminescence, has been extensively investigated in diverse applications from information technology to biomedicine. In promoting brightness and enriching the functionalities of the downshifting luminescence of RENPs, numerous studies have exploited inert shell to protect rare-earth dopants from surface quenchers. However, internal concentration quenching remains an unsolved puzzle when using higher dopant concentrations of rare-earth ions in an attempt to obtain brighter emission. Following a plethora of research involving core-shell structures, the interface has shown to be controllable, ranging from a well-defined, abrupt boundary to an obscure one with cation intermixing. By utilizing this inter-mixed core-shell property for the first time, we design a new architecture to create a homogeneous double-layer core-shell interface to extend the active layer, allowing more luminescent centers without severe concentration quenching. By systematically deploying the crystallinity of the starting core, shell growth dynamics, and dopant concentrations, the downshifting luminescence intensity of new archictecture achieves a 12-fold enhancement surpassing the traditional core-shell structure. These results provide deeper insight into the potential benefits of the intermixed core-shell structure, offering an effective approach to tackling the internal concentration quenching effect for highly boosted NIR optical performance.

Title: Demonstration of highly scaled AlScN ferroelectric diode memory with storage density > 100 Mbit/mm$^2$
Authors: Zekun Hu, Hyunmin Cho, Rajeev Kumar Rai, Kefei Bao, Yinuo Zhang, Yunfei He, Yaoyang Ji, Chloe Leblanc, Kwan-Ho Kim, Zirun Han, Zhen Qiu, Xingyu Du, Eric A. Stach, Roy Olsson, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: Wurtzite nitride ferroelectric materials have emerged as promising candidates for next-generation memory applications due to their exceptional polarization properties and compatibility with conventional semiconductor processing techniques. Here, we demonstrate the first successful scaling of Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) ferroelectric diode (FeDiode) memory down to 50 nm device diameters while maintaining functional performance. Using a 20 nm Al0.64Sc0.36N ferroelectric layer, we investigate both metal-insulator-ferroelectric-metal (MIFM) and metal-ferroelectric-metal (MFM) architectures to optimize device performance. Our scaled devices exhibit a previously unreported size-dependent behavior, where switching voltage decreases while breakdown field increases with miniaturization, resulting in an enhanced breakdown-to-coercive field ratio exceeding 2.6 for the smallest structures. This favorable scaling behavior enables reliable operation at reduced dimensions critical for high-density applications. The MIFM devices demonstrate stable 3-bit non-volatile multistate behavior with clearly distinguishable resistance states and retention exceeding $5\times 10^5$ seconds. This combination of scalability and simple structure enables an effective memory density of 100 Mbit/mm$^2$ under feature size of 50 nm. By achieving 50 nm scaling with enhanced performance metrics, this work establishes AlScN-based FeDiode memory as a highly promising platform for next-generation non-volatile storage with potential for direct integration into CMOS technology.

Title: Write Cycling Endurance Exceeding 1010 in Sub-50 nm Ferroelectric AlScN
Authors: Hyunmin Cho, Yubo Wang, Chloe Leblanc, Yinuo Zhang, Yunfei He, Zirun Han, Roy H. Olsson III, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: Wurtzite ferroelectrics, particularly aluminum scandium nitride (AlScN), have emerged as a promising materials platform for nonvolatile memories, offering high polarization values exceeding 100 uC/cm2. However, their high coercive fields (>3 MV/cm) have limited cycling endurance to ~107 cycles in previous reports. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented control of polarization switching in AlScN, achieving write cycling endurance exceeding 1010 cycles a thousand fold improvement over previous wurtzite ferroelectric benchmarks. Through precise voltage modulation in 45 nm thick Al0.64Sc0.36N capacitors, we show that while complete polarization reversal (2Pr ~ 200 uC/cm2) sustains ~108 cycles, partial switching extends endurance beyond 1010 cycles while maintaining a substantial polarization (>30 uC/cm2 for 2Pr). This exceptional endurance, combined with breakdown fields approaching 10 MV/cm in optimized 10 um diameter devices, represents the highest reported values for any wurtzite ferroelectric. Our findings establish a new paradigm for reliability in nitride ferroelectrics, demonstrating that controlled partial polarization and size scaling enables both high endurance and energy efficient operation.

Title: Role of the Direct-to-Indirect Bandgap Crossover in the 'Reverse' Energy Transfer Process
Authors: Gayatri, Mehdi Arfaoui, Debashish Das, Tomasz Kazimierczuk, Natalia Zawadzka, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Adam Babinski, Saroj K. Nayak, Maciej R. Molas, Arka Karmakar
Abstract: Energy transfer (ET) is a dipole-dipole interaction, mediated by the virtual photon. Traditionally, ET happens from the higher (donor) to lower bandgap (acceptor) material. However, in some rare instances, a 'reverse' ET can happen from the lower-to-higher bandgap material depending on the strong overlap between the acceptor photoluminescence (PL) and the donor absorption spectra. In this work, we report a reverse ET process from the lower bandgap MoS2 to higher bandgap WS2, due to the near 'resonant' overlap between the MoS2 B and WS2 A excitonic levels. Changing the MoS2 bandgap from direct-to-indirect by increasing the layer number results in a reduced ET rate, evident by the quenching of the WS2 PL emission. We also find that, at 300 K the estimated ET timescale of around 45 fs is faster than the reported thermalization of the MoS2 excitonic intervalley scattering (K+ to K-) time and comparable with the interlayer charge transfer time.

Title: Two-field theory for phase coexistence of active Brownian particles
Authors: Pablo Perez-Bastías, Rodrigo Soto
Abstract: Active Brownian particles (ABPs) serve as a minimal model of active matter systems. When ABPs are sufficiently persistent, they undergo a liquid-gas phase separation and, in the presence of obstacles, accumulate around them, forming a wetting layer. Here, we perform simulations of ABPs in a quasi-one-dimensional domain in the presence of a wall, studying the dynamics of the polarization field. On the course of time, we observe a transition from a homogeneous (where all particles are aligned) to a heterogeneous (where particles align only at the interface) polarization regime. We propose coarse-grained equations for the density and polarization fields based on microscopic and phenomenological arguments that correctly account for the observed phenomena.

Title: Adaptive AI decision interface for autonomous electronic material discovery
Authors: Yahao Dai, Henry Chan, Aikaterini Vriza, Fredrick Kim, Yunfei Wang, Wei Liu, Naisong Shan, Jing Xu, Max Weires, Yukun Wu, Zhiqiang Cao, C. Suzanne Miller, Ralu Divan, Xiaodan Gu, Chenhui Zhu, Sihong Wang, Jie Xu
Abstract: AI-powered autonomous experimentation (AI/AE) can accelerate materials discovery but its effectiveness for electronic materials is hindered by data scarcity from lengthy and complex design-fabricate-test-analyze cycles. Unlike experienced human scientists, even advanced AI algorithms in AI/AE lack the adaptability to make informative real-time decisions with limited datasets. Here, we address this challenge by developing and implementing an AI decision interface on our AI/AE system. The central element of the interface is an AI advisor that performs real-time progress monitoring, data analysis, and interactive human-AI collaboration for actively adapting to experiments in different stages and types. We applied this platform to an emerging type of electronic materials-mixed ion-electron conducting polymers (MIECPs) -- to engineer and study the relationships between multiscale morphology and properties. Using organic electrochemical transistors (OECT) as the testing-bed device for evaluating the mixed-conducting figure-of-merit -- the product of charge-carrier mobility and the volumetric capacitance ({\mu}C*), our adaptive AI/AE platform achieved a 150% increase in {\mu}C* compared to the commonly used spin-coating method, reaching 1,275 F cm-1 V-1 s-1 in just 64 autonomous experimental trials. A study of 10 statistically selected samples identifies two key structural factors for achieving higher volumetric capacitance: larger crystalline lamellar spacing and higher specific surface area, while also uncovering a new polymer polymorph in this material.

Authors: Pieter H. W. van der Hoek, Angelo Rosa, Ralf Everaers
Abstract: We present a graph theoretical approach to the configurational statistics of random tree-like objects, such as randomly branching polymers. In particular, we show that Prüfer labelling provides: (i) direct access to the exact configurational entropy as a function of the tree composition, (ii) computable exact expressions for partition functions and important experimental observables for tree ensembles with controlled branching activity and (iii) an efficient sampling scheme for corresponding tree configurations and arbitrary static properties.

Title: Compensation-Like Temperature and Spin-Flip Switch in Strained Thulium Iron Garnet Thin Films: Tuning Sublattice Interactions for Ferrimagnetic Spintronics
Authors: Carlos C. Soares, Thiago J. A. Mori, Fanny Béron, Jagadeesh S. Moodera, Júlio C. Cezar, Jeovani Brandão, Gilvânia Vilela
Abstract: Certain rare-earth iron garnet (RIG) thin films combine desirable properties such as low magnetic damping, high magnetostriction, and, in some cases, perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA), making them attractive for spintronics applications. However, the interplay between their magnetic sublattices in confined films remains poorly explored, particularly the coupling between 3d and 4f electrons. Here, we investigate the magnetic properties of a 30 nm-thick thulium iron garnet (TmIG) thin film, where tensile strain promotes PMA. SQUID magnetometry and X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism measurements reveal a magnetization minimum near 50 K under moderate magnetic fields, leading to a compensation-like temperature (Tcomp-like), a feature absent in bulk TmIG. The presence of Tcomp-like is particularly relevant for controlling magnetization dynamics through compensation phenomena. Additionally, we observe a field-induced spin-flip transition in the Tm sublattice, where Tm moments reorient and align ferromagnetically concerning the Fe sublattices. This mechanism can be exploited for energy-efficient magnetization reversal. These findings provide new insights into strain-driven magnetic phenomena in rare-earth iron garnet thin films, highlighting the interplay between exchange interactions and anisotropy in confined geometries, which is crucial for the development of spintronic and magnonic devices.

Title: Charge transfer induced insulating state at antiperovskite/perovskite heterointerfaces
Authors: Ting Cui, Ying Zhou, Qianying Wang, Dongke Rong, Haitao Hong, Axin Xie, Jun-Jie Zhang, Qinghua Zhang, Can Wang, Chen Ge, Lin Gu, Shanmin Wang, Kuijuan Jin, Shuai Dong, Er-Jia Guo
Abstract: Heterointerfaces have been pivotal in unveiling extraordinary interfacial properties and enabling multifunctional material platforms. Despite extensive research on all-oxide interfaces, heterointerfaces between different material classes, such as oxides and nitrides, remain underexplored. Here we present the fabrication of a high-quality Dirac metal antiperovskite Ni3InN, characterized by an extremely low temperature coefficient of resistivity, approximately 1.8*10^-8 {\Omega}*cm/K, over a broad temperature range. Atomically sharp heterointerfaces between Ni3InN and SrVO3 were constructed, revealing intriguing interfacial phenomena. Leveraging layer-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy and electron energy loss spectroscopy, we identified pronounced charge transfer across the well-ordered interface. Remarkably, this interfacial electron transfer from Ni3InN to SrVO3 induces an insulating interfacial layer and an emergent magnetic moment within the Ni3InN layer, consistent with first-principles calculations. These findings pave the way for novel electronic and spintronic applications by enabling tunable interfacial properties in nitride/oxide systems.

Title: Forster resonance energy transfer in inhomogeneous and absorptive environment
Authors: L. S. Petrosyan, M. N. Noginov, T. V. Shahbazyan
Abstract: We present an analytical model for Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) between a donor and an acceptor placed in inhomogeneous and absorptive environment characterized by complex dielectric function, e.g., near a metal-dielectric structure. By extending the standard approach to FRET to include energy transfer (ET) channel to the environment, we show that, in the absence of plasmonic enhancement effects, the Forster radius, which defines the characteristic distance for efficient FRET, is reduced due to a competing ET process. We demonstrate that a reduction of the Forster radius can affect dramatically fluorescence from large ensemble of molecules whose emission kinetics is dominated by FRET-induced concentration quenching. Specifically, we perform numerical calculations for dye-doped polymer films deposited on top of metallic substrate to find that, for high dye concentrations, the emission kinetics slows down considerably, in sharp contrast to acceleration of single-molecule fluorescence. Furthermore, the calculated effective fluorescence decay rate exhibits non-monotonic behavior with varying film thickness, consistent with the experiment, indicating a non-trivial interplay between the metal quenching and concentration quenching mechanisms.

Title: Sliding of liquid droplets on thin viscoelastic soft layers
Authors: Menghua Zhao (MSC, LSIMM), Julien Dervaux (MSC), Tetsuharu Narita (LSIMM), François Lequeux (LSIMM), Laurent Limat (MSC), Matthieu Roché (MSC)
Abstract: Soft substrates are deformed by liquid-vapor surface tension upon contact with liquid droplets, forming the well-known wetting ridge. This ridge dynamically propagates with the moving contact line and critically influences liquid spreading. Here, we experimentally investigate gravity-driven sliding dynamics of water droplets on vertically tilted silicone layers whose viscoleasticity is characterized by the Chasset-Thirion model with the exponent m. At low Bond numbers, the sliding velocity scales with droplet size as V S $\sim$ D 2 m . While in the thin-film limit, velocity exhibits a pronounced power-law dependence on nominal substrate thickness, V S $\sim$ $\Pi$(h) -1 m . We rationalize these observations by quantifying viscoelastic dissipation within the soft layer and balancing it against the gravitational driving force using an energy-conservation framework. Our findings offer novel avenues for designing advanced soft coatings, anti-fouling and self-cleaning surfaces, and biomedical devices.

Title: Target search optimization by threshold resetting
Authors: Arup Biswas, Satya N Majumdar, Arnab Pal
Abstract: We introduce a new class of first passage time optimization driven by threshold resetting, inspired by many natural processes where crossing a critical limit triggers failure, degradation or transition. In here, search agents are collectively reset when a threshold is reached, creating event-driven, system-coupled simultaneous resets that induce long-range interactions. We develop a unified framework to compute search times for these correlated stochastic processes, with ballistic searchers as a key example uncovering diverse optimization behaviors. A cost function, akin to breakdown penalties, reveals that optimal resetting can forestall larger losses. This formalism generalizes to broader stochastic systems with multiple degrees of freedom.

Title: Effect of an electromagnetic field on the barrier crossing rate
Authors: L. R. Rahul Biswas, Shrabani Mondal, Bidhan Chandra Bag
Abstract: We investigate the spectrum for the rate constant of an electric field-driven charged Brownian particle in the presence of a magnetic field (MF). For the cross fields with low or high values of the cyclotron frequency, an asymmetric splitting of the spectrum occurs with two peaks. Anharmonicity-induced additional splitting may appear around the lower resonating frequency at the intermediate strength of the applied MF. Another observation is that if the magnetic field is tilted from the z-direction, an additional peak appears between the two peaks. The position of the middle peak may be independent of the strength of the applied MF. In some cases, only one peak appears even in the presence of a magnetic field. We explain these observations considering the dynamics around the stable fixed point and determine the position of the peak in the spectrum for the rate constant as a function of the strength of the applied magnetic field. Thus the present study may find applications for tuning the conductivity of a solid electrolyte, which is very important in recent technology. Other applications may be in areas such as electromagnetic field-induced modulation of (a) thermally activated tunneling ionization, (b) thermally stimulated ionization, etc.

Title: Extracting flow stress surfaces of pristine materials using deformation paths in MD simulations
Authors: Eliott T. Dubois, Paul Lafourcade, Jean-Bernard Maillet
Abstract: Accurate simulation of deformation processes at the atomic scale is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials and particularly the calculation of directional flow stresses. This work presents a method for applying arbitrary deformation paths in LAMMPS while adhering to its convention that supercell periodic vectors a, b are aligned such that a coincides with the x-axis and b lies in the (x,y) plane. This method is particularly relevant for materials with low crystal symmetry and also for exploring non uniaxial deformations. The first step of the method consists in generating the simulation frame tensor's time evolution upon any deformation, which may initially violate LAMMPS alignment constraints. This constraint is then overcome by the application of a rigid body rotation to realign the tensor with LAMMPS's convention, ensuring valid periodic boundary conditions. The resulting lengths and tilt factors from the rotated tensor are expressed analytically using third-order polynomials and applied to the simulation cell using the fix deform command. The present approach versatility is validated with the calculation of directional flow stresses for various materials upon constant volume shear, tension and compression, demonstrating its effectiveness in simulations involving complex deformation scenarios and diverse crystal structures. The flow stress surface extracted from these simulations are finally analyzed as the fingerprint of all deformation mechanisms occurring in the material.

Title: Emergence of rotating clusters in active Brownian particles with visual perception
Authors: Radha Madhab Chandra, Alan Biju John, A. V. Anil Kumar
Abstract: We examine the group formation and subsequent dynamics of active particles which are equipped with a visual perception using Langevin dynamics simulations. These particles possess an orientational response to the position of the nearest neighbours which are within a vision cone of these particles. We observe the emergence of rotating clusters when the visual perception of the particles are in the intermediate range. We have found that the persistent motion of these active particles are intimately correlated with the emerging structures by analysing the persistence probability as well as the orientational correlation function. For rotating clusters, the persistent probability is found to be very quickly decaying and orientational correlation function shows oscillatory behaviour.

Title: Coplanar order induced by emergent frustration
Authors: Zehui Deng, Lu Liu, Wenan Guo, Hai-Qing Lin
Abstract: Traditional frustration arises from the conflict between the spin alignments due to the geometry or the nature of the interactions. Here, we demonstrate a novel form of frustration, dubbed ``emergent frustration'', which is induced by the symmetry that emerges at the phase transition point of a quantum spin model devoid of geometric frustration. We study the two-dimensional bipartite chequerboard $J$-$Q$ model, which hosts the antiferromagnetic (AFM) state to the plaquette-singlet solid state (PSS) phase transition detected in the Shastry-Sutherland compound SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. By analyzing the scaling behavior of the Rényi entanglement entropy with smooth boundaries at the transition point, we observe an unexpected scaling behavior, which indicates that the number of Goldstone modes is five. We explain this by proposing a novel scenario in which the system is described by an effective quantum rotor Hamiltonian with a three-sublattice geometry that frustrates collinear order while supporting coplanar order. Such a three-sublattice geometry arises from the emergent symmetry of coexisting orders, which may also occur at the AFM-PSS transition point of SrCu$_2({\rm BO}_3)_2$. Therefore, experimental investigations are warranted.

Title: Long-range electron coherence in Kagome metals

McDonald, Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Manex Alkorta, Ion Errea, Maia G. Vergniory, Takashi Oka, Roderich Moessner, Mark H. Fischer, Titus Neupert, Claudia Felser, Philip J.W. Moll
Abstract: The wave-like nature of electrons lies at the core of quantum mechanics, distinguishing them from classical particles. Landmark experiments have revealed phase coherence of mobile electrons within solids, such as Aharonov-Bohm interference in mesoscopic rings. However, this coherence is typically limited by numerous environmental interactions. Controlling and ideally mitigating such decoherence remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we report magnetoresistance oscillations in mesoscopic pillars of the Kagome metal CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ for fields applied parallel to the Kagome planes. Their periodicity is independent of materials parameters, simply given by the number of flux quanta $h/e$ threading between adjacent Kagome layers akin to an atomic-scale Aharonov-Bohm interferometer. Intriguingly they occur under conditions not favorable for typical interference in solids, at temperatures above 20 K and in micrometer-scale devices well exceeding the single-particle mean free path. Further, the oscillations exhibit non-analytic field-angle dependence and scale consistently with a broad range of key electronic responses in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$, pointing to a cooperative mechanism that establishes intrinsic coherence. Our findings provide new insights into the debated origin of correlated order in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and establish Kagome metals as a promising platform for interaction-stabilized long-range electron coherence - crucial for both fundamental studies and technological advancements in quantum interference in metallic systems.

Title: Chiral Locking of Magnon Flow and Electron Spin Accumulation in Their Near-Field Radiative Spin Transfer
Authors: Xi-Han Zhou, Xiyin Ye, Tao Yu
Abstract: We report a non-contact mechanism for directional injection of magnons in magnetic films when driven by a spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$ of electrons of a nearby metallic layer, governed by the long-range dipolar coupling between magnons and electron spins, which spontaneously generates a magnon current ${\bf J}_m$ flowing in the film plane. Crucially, in such near-field radiative spin transfer, the magnon flow ${\bf J}_m$ is always perpendicular to the spin accumulation $\pmb{\mu}_s$, showing a universal chiral locking relation. The spin injection is efficient even when $\pmb{\mu}_s$ is parallel to the magnetization, a feature breaking the limitation of the spin transfer by contact exchange interaction. Our findings reveal the critical role of dipolar chirality in driving the magnon thermal current and paving the way for the functional design of magnonic devices based on near-field radiative spin transfer.

Title: Pressure dependent ab initio study of the physical properties of hexagonal BeB2C: a possible high-Tc superconductor
Authors: Ruman Ali, Md. Enamul Haque, Jahid Hassan, M. A. Masum, R. S. Islam, S. H. Naqib
Abstract: This study uses the Density Functional Theory to explore the pressure dependent properties of hexagonal BeB2C. The metallic nature of BeB2C was substantiated at ambient pressure, with pressure induced alterations in electronic band structure and Fermi surface topology suggesting a potential for tunability across various applications. The phonon dispersion and phonon density of states show the dynamical stability under pressure. The thermophysical properties are also investigated under varying pressure conditions. Finally, the exploration of superconducting properties found that the transition temperature is in good agreement with previously reported values, and illustrated that beB2C holds considerable promise as a high-temperature superconductor, with pressure augmenting its superconducting properties.

Title: The correspondence between the Adam-Gibbs and the Rosenfield relations
Authors: Bidhan Chandra Bag
Abstract: In this paper, we derive both the Adam-Gibbs and the Rosenfield relations from the microscopic point of view and compare them with the numerical calculation for one and two dimensional systems. The comparison shows there is an excellent agreement between theoretical and numerical calculations for their valid zones (in terms of the thermodynamic temperature) as suggested by experiments. It implies that there may be a transition temperature at which the two relations correspond to each other. We derive a relation to calculate it. Then, we generalize the Rosenfield relation for configurational thermodynamic entropy like quantity(TELQ) and time-dependent Shanon information entropy. At the same time, using a description with a fictitious Hamiltonian, we show that time-dependent configurational Shanon information entropy for a thermodynamic system (of Brownian particles) which is characterized by the absolute temperature, can not be recognized as thermodynamic entropy. At best, it can be identified as a thermodynamic entropy-like quantity. Furthermore, the description based on the fictitious Hamiltonian may lead to the conclusion that the correspondence between the Shanon information entropy and thermodynamic entropy is not a singular feature at equilibrium. It may be a continuation of the correspondence between the information entropy and the thermodynamic entropy-like quantity. Thus, the present study appears to offer important justification for the postulate that the Shannon entropy at steady state may be regarded as a thermodynamic entropy. This postulate holds significant importance in the framework of stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: Single-molecule electroluminescence: crossover from weak to strong coupling

Abstract: We develop a microscopic model to investigate current-induced light emission in single-molecule tunnel junctions, where a two-level system interacts with a plasmonic field. Using the quantum master equation, we explore the transition from weak to strong plasmon-molecule coupling, identifying three distinct regimes governed by cooperativity, which quantifies the interplay between interaction strength and losses. Our findings establish a framework to detect strong coupling, unveiling resonance-dependent features in the emission spectrum and photon correlations.

Title: Electronic structure and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism in the quadruple perovskite CaCu3Re2Fe2O12
Authors: L.V. Bekenov, D.V. Mazur, B.F. Zhuravlev, S.V. Moklyak, Yu.N. Kucherenko, V.N. Antonov
Abstract: We have studied the electronic and magnetic properties of the A- and B-site-ordered perovskite CaCu3Re2Fe2O12 within the density-functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with the consideration of strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+U ) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band structure method. We have calculated the x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) spectra at the Cu, Fe, Re L2,3 and O K edges. The calculated results are in good agreement with experiment. We show that the GGA+U method produces better agreement with the experimental spectra if Hubbard U is applied to Cu and Fe sites.

Abstract: The combination of non-trivial topology and superconductivity opens to novel quantum devices. The discovery of intrinsic materials where such properties appear together represents a frontier in modern condensed matter physics. Trigonal PtBi$_2$ has recently emerged as a possible candidate, being the first example of superconducting type-I Weyl semimetal. However, several aspects of this promising compound still need to be unveiled, concerning its complicated band structure, the actual role of Weyl points in determining its electronic properties and the nature of the superconducting transition. In this work, we experimentally investigated a t-PtBi$_2$ single crystal by means of the Hall and Nernst effects. In particular, we revealed a change of regime in its electronic properties, which is compatible with a temperature and magnetic field evolution of hole-like pockets in the Fermi Surface.

Title: Exploring Charge Density Waves in two-dimensional NbSe$_2$
Authors: Norma Rivano, Francesco Libbi, Chuin Wei Tan, Christopher Cheung, Jose Lado, Arash Mostofi, Philip Kim, Johannes Lischner, Adolfo O. Fumega, Boris Kozinsky, Zachary A. H. Goodwin
Abstract: Niobium diselenide (NbSe$_2$) has garnered attention due to the coexistence of superconductivity and charge density waves (CDWs) down to the monolayer limit. However, realistic modeling of CDWs-accounting for effects such as layer number, twist angle, and strain-remains challenging due to the prohibitive cost of first-principles methods. To address this, we develop machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), based on the Allegro architecture-an E(3)-equivariant model -- specifically tailored to capture subtle CDW effects in NbSe$_2$. These MLIPs enable efficient exploration of commensurate and incommensurate CDW phases, as well as the dimensional dependence of the transition temperature, evaluated using the Stochastic Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SSCHA). Our findings reveal a strong sensitivity of CDWs to stacking and layer number, and a slight suppression of the transition temperature with increasing thickness. This work opens new possibilities for studying and tuning CDWs in NbSe$_2$ and other 2D systems, with implications for electron-phonon coupling, superconductivity, and advanced materials design.

Title: Density functional theory of resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in the quasi-one-dimensional dimer iridate Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$
Authors: D.A. Kukusta, L.V. Bekenov, V.N. Antonov
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$ within the density functional theory using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. We have investigated the x-ray absorption spectra, x-ray magnetic circular dichroism, and resonant inelastic x-ray scattering spectra (RIXS) at the Ir $K$, $L_3$ , $M_3$, $M_5$ and O K edges. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum of Ba$_5$AlIr$_2$O$_{11}$ at the Ir $L_3$ edge possesses sharp twelve features below 1.5 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitations located from 2 to 4 eV are due to $t_{2g} \to e_g$ and $O_{2p} \to t_{2g}$ transitions. The high energy peaks situated at 5-11 eV appear due to charge transfer transitions. The theory reproduces well the shape and polarization dependence of the oxygen O K RIXS spectrum. We have found that the dependence of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge on the incident photon energy and the momentum transfer vector Q is much stronger than the corresponding dependence at the Ir $L_3$ edge

Title: Rabi Oscillations of Strongly Driven Bose Polarons
Authors: Zeyu Liu, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical behavior of quasiparticles is essential for uncovering novel quantum many-body phenomena. Among these phenomena, the polaron in ultracold atomic gases has attracted considerable interest due to its precise controllability. By engineering the underlying Hamiltonian, polarons serve as a versatile platform for studying both equilibrium properties and non-equilibrium dynamics. In this work, we investigate the quantum dynamics of strongly driven Bose polarons, where minority atoms are described as mobile impurities with spin-1/2, and majority atoms are bosons. The spin-$\uparrow$ impurity interacts with majority atoms through a tunable scattering length $a$, while the spin-$\downarrow$ impurity remains non-interacting. After turning on the Rabi coupling, we calculate the evolution of the total magnetization using a trial wavefunction. We identify the exhibition of anomalous Rabi oscillation and steady-state magnetization for $a>0$, due to the interplay between attractive and repulsive polarons. Our results provide a concrete example that illustrates how Rabi oscillations are dressed by system-environment coupling.

Title: Probing Majorana localization of a phase-controlled three-site Kitaev chain with an additional quantum dot

Abstract: Few-site implementations of the Kitaev chain offer a minimal platform to study the emergence and stability of Majorana bound states. Here, we realize two- and three-site chains in semiconducting quantum dots coupled via superconductors, and tune them to the sweet spot where zero-energy Majorana modes appear at the chain ends. We demonstrate control of the superconducting phase through both magnetic field and sweet-spot selection, and fully characterize the excitation spectrum under local and global perturbations. All spectral features are identified using the ideal Kitaev chain model. To assess Majorana localization, we couple the system to an additional quantum dot. The absence of energy splitting at the sweet spot confirms the high quality of the Majorana modes, despite the minimal size of the chains.

Title: Stability of flocking in the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model: Effects of relative population, motility, and noise
Authors: Aditya Kumar Dutta, Matthieu Mangeat, Heiko Rieger, Raja Paul, Swarnajit Chatterjee
Abstract: Natural flocks need to cope with various forms of heterogeneities, for instance, their composition, motility, interaction, or environmental factors. Here, we study the effects of such heterogeneities on the flocking dynamics of the reciprocal two-species Vicsek model [Phys. Rev. E 107, 024607 (2023)], which comprises two groups of self-propelled agents with anti-aligning inter-species interactions and exhibits either parallel or anti-parallel flocking states. The parallel and anti-parallel flocking states vanish upon reducing the size of one group, and the system transitions to a single-species flock of the majority species. At sufficiently low noise (or high density), the minority species can exhibit collective behavior, anti-aligning with the liquid state of the majority species. Unequal self-propulsion speeds of the two species strongly encourage anti-parallel flocking over parallel flocking. However, when activity landscapes with region-dependent motilities are introduced, parallel flocking is retained if the faster region is given more space, highlighting the role of environmental constraints. Under noise heterogeneity, the colder species (subjected to lower noise) attain higher band velocity compared to the hotter one, temporarily disrupting any parallel flocking, which is subsequently restored. These findings collectively reveal how different forms of heterogeneity, both intrinsic and environmental, can qualitatively reshape flocking behavior in this class of reciprocal two-species models.

Title: Orientation attractors in velocity gradient driven processes for large plastic deformations of crystals
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Oguz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: We study lattice orientation attractors, also referred to as preferred or ideal orientations, in crystalline materials, and how they can be used to predict the final texture of polycrystals after manufacturing processes. By treating Crystal Plasticity (CP) in an Eulerian framework, rather than traditional Lagrangian approaches, we overcome the significant challenges associated with lattice distortion, enabling accurate simulations of material behavior under large deformations. This Eulerian perspective allows us to track the evolution of crystallographic orientations directly in the spatial domain, providing crucial insights into texture development. The CP models employed here capture the microstructural evolution in both mono- and polycrystalline materials, with particular emphasis on velocity gradient driven processes. Our linear stability analysis strategy, while applicable to general CP formulations, is demonstrated using a simplified rigid-(visco)-plastic 2-D model with three slip systems. This approach successfully predicts the lattice orientation attractors for very large strains (exceeding 50$\%$) by analyzing how different slip systems interact under applied loads. Three numerical simulations illustrate the theory's effectiveness: polycrystal deformation under homogeneous velocity gradient loading, void evolution in a monocrystal under non-homogeneous loading, and slip band formation during uni-axial traction. High-resolution CP simulations, enhanced through re-meshing techniques, further validate our findings on how initial crystallographic orientations, deformation mechanisms, and loading conditions affect the evolution of orientation attractors and ultimate crystal texture.

Title: Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes
Authors: Alberto Guandalini, Giovanni Caldarelli, Francesco Macheda, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} < {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.

Title: Isotropic and anisotropic spin-dependent transport in epitaxial Fe$_3$Si
Authors: Nozomi Soya, Michihiro Yamada, Kohei Hamaya, Kazuya Ando
Abstract: We investigate spin-dependent transport phenomena in epitaxially grown Fe$_3$Si films, focusing on the anisotropic magnetoresistance (AMR), planar Hall effect (PHE), anomalous Hall effect (AHE), and spin Hall effect (SHE). While the sign and magnitude of the AMR and PHE depend on the current orientation relative to the crystallographic axes, the AHE and SHE remain nearly independent of the current orientation. The anisotropic AMR and PHE are attributed to current and magnetization dependent local band properties, including band crossing/anticrossing at specific $k$ points. In contrast, the isotropic AHE and SHE arise from the Berry curvature integrated over the entire Brillouin zone, which cancels local variations. These findings highlight the interplay between symmetry, band structure, and magnetization in the spin-dependent transport phenomena.

Title: Generating new coordination compounds via multireference simulations, genetic algorithms and machine learning: the case of Co(II) molecular magnets
Authors: Lion Frangoulis, Zahra Khatibi, Lorenzo A. Mariano, Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: The design of coordination compounds with target properties often requires years of continuous feedback loop between theory, simulations and experiments. In the case of magnetic molecules, this conventional strategy has indeed led to the breakthrough of single-molecule magnets with working temperatures above nitrogen's boiling point, but at significant costs in terms of resources and time. Here, we propose a computational strategy able to accelerate the discovery of new coordination compounds with desired electronic and magnetic properties. Our approach is based on a combination of high-throughput multireference ab initio methods, genetic algorithms and machine learning. While genetic algorithms allow for an intelligent sampling of the vast chemical space available, machine learning reduces the computational cost by pre-screening molecular properties in advance of their accurate and automated multireference ab initio characterization. Importantly, the presented framework is able to generate novel organic ligands and explore chemical motifs beyond those available in pre-existing structural databases. We showcase the power of this approach by automatically generating new Co(II) mononuclear coordination compounds with record magnetic properties in a fraction of the time required by either experiments or brute-force ab initio approaches

Title: Optical engineering and detection of magnetism in moiré semiconductors
Authors: Tsung-Sheng Huang, Andrey Grankin, Yu-Xin Wang, Mohammad Hafezi
Abstract: We present a general framework for optically inducing, controlling, and probing spin states in moiré systems. In particular, we demonstrate that applying Raman optical drives to moiré transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers can realize a class of spin models, with magnetic interactions tunable via the optical parameters. The resulting interaction anisotropy, controlled by the polarizations of the drives, enables access to magnetic states that are inaccessible in undriven moiré bilayers. Furthermore, we establish direct connections between the resulting spin correlations and experimentally observable optical signals. Our work paves the way for future studies on the optical control and detection on strongly correlated quantum systems.

Title: Emergent chiral toplogical point gaps in a non-Hermitian quasiperiodic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model
Authors: Zhi-Bin Liang, Shan-Zhong Li, Runze Li, Zhi Li
Abstract: We study a quasiperiodic Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattice with staggered on-site gain-loss. The results reveal that on-site staggered gain-loss can effectively induce non-Hermitian topological gap without introducing imaginary phase. Further analysis exhibits that five different processes of topological phase transitions, including topological re-entrant phenomena, with the gain-loss intensity increasing. In addition, through the analysis of inverse participation ratios, normalized participation ratios, winding number and other indicators, we find that topological phase transitions occur synchronically with localized phase transitions. Finally, by investigating the properties of dual space eigenfunction, we reveal that the non-Hermitian topological point gaps predicted in this paper are chiral point gaps, which have a pair of skin modes along opposite directions simultaneously.

Title: Lattice Quantum Geometry Controlling 118 K Multigap Superconductivity in Heavily Overdoped CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d
Authors: Gaetano Campi, Massimiliano Catricala, Giuseppe Chita, Luisa Barba, Luchuan Shi, Jianfa Zhao, Changing Jin, Antonio Bianconi
Abstract: Synchrotron X-ray diffraction has been used to study the thermal structure evolution in CuBa2Ca3Cu4O10+d (Cu1234), a superconductor which exhibits a high critical temperature (Tc 118 K), high critical current density and large upper critical magnetic field. The lattice geometry at nanoscale of this cuprate belongs to the class of natural heterostructures at atomic limit like the artificial high Tc superlattices made of interface space charge in Mott insulator units intercalated by metal units. Temperature-dependent lattice parameters reveal a distinct structural transition at TC characterized by a drop of the c-axis and in plane Cu-O negative thermal expansion below TC. These results provide clear evidence of lattice reorganization associated with the chemical potential changes due to the opening of multiple superconducting gaps. Additionally, evidence for oxygen defects rearrangement is observed at temperatures above 200 K. We construct a phase diagram correlating temperature, the c/a axis ratio, and in plane Cu-O strain, identifying regions associated with gaps opening and oxygen rearrangement. These findings provide new insights into how lattice geometry control superconductivity to inform the material design of advanced nanoscale superconducting artificial quantum heterostructures.

Title: Accurate Point Defect Energy Levels from Non-Empirical Screened Range-Separated Hybrid Functionals: the Case of Native Vacancies in ZnO
Authors: Sijia Ke, Stephen E. Gant, Leeor Kronik, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: We use density functional theory (DFT) with non-empirically tuned screened range-separated hybrid (SRSH) functionals to calculate the electronic properties of native zinc and oxygen vacancy point defects in ZnO, and we predict their defect levels for thermal and optical transitions in excellent agreement with available experiments and prior calculations that use empirical hybrid functionals. The ability of this non-empirical first-principles framework to accurately predict quantities of relevance to both bulk and defect level spectroscopy enables high-accuracy DFT calculations with non-empirical hybrid functionals for defect physics, at a reduced computational cost.

Title: Quantum precursors to Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theorem in Floquet spin-$J$ systems
Authors: Jesús A. Segura-Landa, Meenu Kumari, Daniel J. Nader, Sercan Hüsnügil, Ali SaraerToosi, Sergio Lerma-Hernández
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser (KAM) theorem proves that the resonant tori of classical integrable Hamiltonians are broken when a non-integrable perturbation is introduced, whereas non-resonant tori are resilient and only get deformed for up to a finite value of the perturbative parameter. In this letter, we identify quantum precursors to the KAM theorem in one-degree-of-freedom spin Hamiltonians periodically perturbed by instantaneous kicks. After recognizing quantum signatures of resonances in the Floquet eigenstates of the perturbed Hamiltonian, we reveal a differentiated sensitivity to the perturbation of the eigenstates of the unperturbed Hamiltonian, depending on whether the states satisfy a resonant condition or not. It is also shown that this differentiated sensitivity becomes more pronounced as the system size increases, leading to the KAM theorem in the classical limit $J\rightarrow\infty$. Numerical and analytical results obtained from unitary perturbation theory strongly support these findings. Although specific to kicked models, our results can be easily extended to more general scenarios, allowing the identification of the quantum mechanism that corresponds to the KAM theorem in the classical limit.

Title: The $β$-decay spectrum of Tritiated graphene: combining nuclear quantum mechanics with Density Functional Theory
Authors: Andrea Casale, Angelo Esposito, Guido Menichetti, Valentina Tozzini
Abstract: We present the results of a multi-methodological study aimed at investigating the interaction between graphene and Tritium during its $\beta$-decay to Helium, under different levels of loading and geometrical configurations. We combine Density Functional Theory (DFT), to evaluate the interaction potentials, with calculations of the decay rate, in order to study the consequences that the presence of the substrate has on the $\beta$-decay spectrum of Tritium. We determine the shape of the event rate, accounting for the effects of (part of) the corresponding condensed matter degrees of freedom. In the context of future neutrino experiments, our results provide important information aimed at the optimization of hosting material, as well as the determination of the physics reach. Furthermore, our work outlines a novel theoretical and computational scheme to address a question at the boundary between high and low energy physics. This requires non-conventional declinations of DFT combined with full quantum treatments of the nuclear configuration involved in the decay process.

Title: Atomic-scale imaging and charge state manipulation of NV centers by scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Arjun Raghavan, Seokjin Bae, Nazar Delegan, F. Joseph Heremans, Vidya Madhavan
Abstract: Nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are among the most promising solid-state qubit candidates, owing to their exceptionally long spin coherence times, efficient spin-photon coupling, room-temperature operation, and steadily advancing fabrication and integration techniques. Despite significant progress in the field, atomic-scale characterization and control of individual NV centers have remained elusive. In this work, we present a novel approach utilizing a conductive graphene capping layer to enable direct imaging and manipulation of $NV^{-}$ defects via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM). By investigating over 40 individual $NV^{-}$ centers, we identify their spectroscopic signatures and spatial configurations. Our dI/dV conductance spectra reveal the ground state approximately 300 meV below the Fermi level. Additionally, density-of-states mapping uncovers a two-lobed wavefunction aligned along the [111] crystallographic direction. Remarkably, we demonstrate the ability to manipulate the charge state of the NV centers from $NV^{-}$ to $NV^{0}$ through STM tip-induced gating. This work represents a significant advancement in the atomic-scale understanding and engineering of NV centers, paving the way for future quantum device development.

Title: Quantum Geometry of Finite XY Chains: A Comparison of Neveu-Schwarz and Ramond Sectors
Authors: Nayereh Einali, Hosein Mohammadzadeh, Vadood Adami, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: This paper presents a geometrical analysis of finite length XY quantum chains. We begin by examining the ground state and the first excited state of the model, emphasizing the impact of finite size effects under two distinct choices of the Jordan Wigner transformation: the Neveu Schwartz (NS) and Ramond (R) sectors. We explore the geometric features of the system by analyzing the quantum (Berry) curvature derived from the Fubini Study metric, which is intimately connected to the quantum Fisher information. This approach uncovers a rich interplay between boundary conditions and quantum geometry. In the gamma h parameter space, we identify distinct sign changing arcs of the curvature, confined to some region. These arcs mark transitions between the NS and R sectors, indicating fundamental changes in the structure of the fermionic ground state. Remarkably, the number of such transition lines increases with system size, hinting at an emergent continuum of topological boundary effects in the thermodynamic limit. Our findings highlight a novel mechanism where boundary conditions shape quantum geometric properties, offering new insights into finite size topology and the structure of low dimensional quantum systems.

Title: Magnetic Thomas-Fermi theory for 2D abelian anyons
Authors: Antoine Levitt (LMO), Douglas Lundholm, Nicolas Rougerie (UMPA-ENSL)
Abstract: Two-dimensional abelian anyons are, in the magnetic gauge picture, represented as fermions coupled to magnetic flux tubes. For the ground state of such a system in a trapping potential, we theoretically and numerically investigate a Hartree approximate model, obtained by restricting trial states to Slater determinants and introducing a self-consistent magnetic field, locally proportional to matter density. This leads to a fermionic variant of the Chern-Simons-Schr{ö}dinger system. We find that for dense systems, a semi-classical approximation yields qualitatively good results. Namely, we derive a density functional theory of magnetic Thomas-Fermi type, which correctly captures the trends of our numerical results. In particular, we explore the subtle dependence of the ground state with respect to the fraction of magnetic flux units attached to particles.

Abstract: Superconducting circuits comprising Josephson junctions have spurred significant research activity due to their promise to realize scalable quantum computers. Effective Hamiltonians for these systems have traditionally been derived assuming the junction connects superconducting islands of infinite size. We derive a quantized Hamiltonian for a Josephson junction between finite-sized islands and predict measurable corrections to the qubit frequency and charge susceptibility to test the theory.

Title: Metrology of open quantum systems from emitted radiation
Authors: Siddhant Midha, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We explore the task of learning about the dynamics of a Markovian open quantum system by monitoring the information it radiates into its environment. For an open system with Hilbert space dimension $D$, the quantum state of the emitted radiation can be described as a temporally ordered matrix-product state (MPS). We provide simple analytical expressions for the quantum Fisher information (QFI) of the radiation state, which asymptotically scales linearly with the sensing time unless the open system has multiple steady states. We characterize the crossovers in QFI near dynamical phase transitions, emphasizing the role of temporal correlations in setting the asymptotic rate at which QFI increases. We discuss when optimal sensing is possible with instantaneously measured radiation.

Title: Ultrafast electron-phonon scattering in antiferromagnetic Dirac semimetals
Authors: Marius Weber, Kai Leckron, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo sinova, Baerbel Rethfeld, Hans Christian Schneider
Abstract: Topological antiferromagnetic systems, which exhibit anisotropic band structures combined with complex relativistic spin structures in momentum space, have shown strong magnetoresistance effects driven by Dirac fermion characteristics. While these new antiferromagnets have been studied in transport experiments, very little is known about their spin-dependent electronic dynamics on ultrafast timescales and far-from-equilibrium behavior. This paper investigates theoretically the spin-dependent electronic dynamics due to electron-phonon scattering in a model electronic band structure that corresponds to a Dirac semimetal antiferromagnet. Following a spin conserving instantaneous excitation we obtain a change of the antiferromagnetic spin polarization due to the scattering dynamics for the site-resolved spin expectation values. This allows us to identify fingerprints of the anisotropic band structure in the carrier dynamics on ultrashort timescales.

Title: Geodesic learning
Authors: Arnab Barua, Haralampos Hatzikirou, Sumiyoshi Abe
Abstract: Learning is a fundamental characteristic of living systems, enabling them to comprehend their environments and make informed decisions. These decision-making processes are inherently influenced by available information about their surroundings and specific objectives. There is an intriguing perspective is that each process is highly efficient under a given set of conditions. A key question, then, is how close to optimality it is or how efficient it is under given conditions. Here, the concept of "geodesic learning" as the optimal reference process, with which each process can be compared, is introduced and formulated on the basis of geometry. The probability distribution describing the state of the composite system consisting of the environment, termed the "information bath", and a decision-maker is characterized by use of the entropic quantities. This enables one to study the system in analogy with thermodynamics. Learning processes are expressed as the changes of parameters contained in the distribution. For a geometric interpretation of the processes, the manifold endowed with the Fisher-Rao metric as the Riemannian metric is considered. This framework allows one to conceptualize the optimality of each process as a state change along a geodesic curve on the manifold, which gives rise to geodesic learning. Then, the bivariate Gaussian model is presented, and the processes of geodesic learning and adaptation are analyzed for illustrating this approach.

Title: Quantum oscillations in the hole-doped cuprates and the confinement of spinons
Authors: Pietro M. Bonetti, Maine Christos, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A long standing problem in the study of the under-hole-doped cuprates has been the description of the Fermi surfaces underlying the high magnetic field quantum oscillations, and their connection to the higher temperature pseudogap metal. Harrison and Sebastian (arXiv:1103.4181) proposed that the pseudogap `Fermi arcs' are reconstructed into an electron pocket by field-induced charge density wave order. But computations on such a model (Zhang and Mei, arXiv:1411.2098) show an unobserved additional oscillation frequency from a Fermi surface arising from the backsides of the hole pockets completing the Fermi arcs. We describe a transition from a fractionalized Fermi liquid (FL*) model of the pseudogap metal, to a metal with bi-directional charge density wave order without fractionalization. We show that the confinement of the fermionic spinon excitations of the FL* across this transition can eliminate the unobserved oscillation frequency.

Title: Randomness in atomic disorder and consequent squandering of spin-polarization in a ferromagnetically fragile quaternary Heusler alloy FeRuCrSi
Authors: Shuvankar Gupta, Sudip Chakraborty, Vidha Bhasin, Celine Barreteau, Jean-Claude Crivello, Jean-Marc Greneche, S.N. Jha, D. Bhattacharyya, Eric Alleno, Chandan Mazumdar
Abstract: Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi ( 0 $<$ x $<$1) system is theoretically predicted to be one of the very few known examples of robust half-metallic ferromagnet with 100\% spin polarization. Since Cr is considered to be the main contributor to magnetism, the Fe/Ru substitution is not expected to disturb its magnetic properties any significantly, and hence all Fe-containing members of the series are predicted to follow Slater-Pauling rule with a saturation magnetic moment of 2 ${\mu_B}$/f.u. However, contrarily to the theoretical expectations, some experiments rather show a linear variation of the saturation magnetization and Curie temperature with Fe (\textit{x}) substitution. The equiatomic member FeRuCrSi of this family is also considered as a technologically important material, where the band structure calculations suggest the material to be spin gapless semiconductor. Through our in-depth structural analysis of FeRuCrSi using X-ray diffraction, extended X-ray absorption fine structure and $^{57}$Fe Mössbauer spectrometry, we found a random disorder between Fe and Ru sites, while the magnetic moment in this system is actually contributed by Fe atoms, questioning the very basic foundation of the half-metallic character proposed by all theoretical calculations on Ru$_{2-x}$Fe$_x$CrSi series. Our Mössbauer result also envisions a rather rare scenario where the main physical properties are intricately correlated to the chemistry of the material in the form of random atomic disorder on a localised scale.

Title: Anomalous current fluctuations from Euler hydrodynamics
Authors: Takato Yoshimura, Žiga Krajnik
Abstract: We consider the hydrodynamic origin of anomalous current fluctuations in a family of stochastic charged cellular automata. Using ballistic macroscopic fluctuation theory, we study both typical and large fluctuations of the charge current and reproduce microscopic results which are available for the deterministic single-file limit of the models. Our results indicate that in general initial fluctuations propagated by Euler equations fully characterize both scales of anomalous fluctuations. For stochastic dynamics, we find an additional contribution to typical fluctuations and conjecture the functional form of the typical probability distribution, which we confirm by numerical simulations.

Title: Theory for the Anomalous Phase Behavior of Inertial Active Brownian Particles
Authors: Jiechao Feng, Ahmad K. Omar
Abstract: In contrast to equilibrium systems, inertia can profoundly impact the phase behavior of active systems. This has been made particularly evident in recent years, with motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) exhibiting several intriguing dependencies on translational inertia. Here we report extensive simulations characterizing the phase behavior of inertial active matter and develop a mechanical theory for the complete phase diagram without appealing to equilibrium notions. Our theory qualitatively captures all aspects of liquid-gas coexistence, including the critical value of inertia above which MIPS ceases. Notably, our findings highlight that particle softness, and not inertia, is responsible for the MIPS reentrance effect at the center of a proposed active refrigeration cycle.

Title: Optical bounds on many-electron localization
Authors: Ivo Souza, Richard M. Martin, Massimiliano Stengel
Abstract: We establish rigorous inequalities between different electronic properties linked to optical sum rules, and organize them into weak and strong bounds on three characteristic properties of insulators: electron localization length $\ell$ (the quantum fluctuations in polarization), electric susceptibility $\chi$, and optical gap $E_{\rm G}$. All-electron and valence-only versions of the bounds are given, and the latter are found to be more informative. The bounds on $\ell$ are particularly interesting, as they provide reasonably tight estimates for an ellusive ground-state property - the average localization length of valence electrons - from tabulated experimental data: electron density, high-frequency dielectric constant, and optical gap. The localization lengths estimated in this way for several materials follow simple chemical trends, especially for the alkali halides. We also illustrate our findings via analytically solvable harmonic oscillator models, which reveal an intriguing connection to the physics of long-ranged van der Waals forces.

Title: Collective optical properties of moiré excitons
Authors: Tsung-Sheng Huang, Yu-Xin Wang, Yan-Qi Wang, Darrick Chang, Mohammad Hafezi, Andrey Grankin
Abstract: We propose that excitons in moiré transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers offer a promising platform for investigating collective radiative properties. While some of these optical properties resemble those of cold atom arrays, moiré excitons extend to the deep subwavelength limit, beyond the reach of current optical lattice experiments. Remarkably, we show that the collective optical properties can be exploited to probe certain correlated electron states without requiring subwavelength spatial resolution. Specifically, we illustrate that the Wigner crystal states of electrons doped into these bilayers act as an emergent periodic potential for excitons. Moreover, the collective dissipative excitonic bands and their associated Berry curvature can reveal various charge orders that emerge at the corresponding electronic doping. Our study provides a promising pathway for future research on the interplay between collective effects and strong correlations involving moiré excitons.

Title: Spin glass model of in-context learning
Authors: Yuhao Li, Ruoran Bai, Haiping Huang
Abstract: Large language models show a surprising in-context learning ability -- being able to use a prompt to form a prediction for a query, yet without additional training, in stark contrast to old-fashioned supervised learning. Providing a mechanistic interpretation and linking the empirical phenomenon to physics are thus challenging and remain unsolved. We study a simple yet expressive transformer with linear attention and map this structure to a spin glass model with real-valued spins, where the couplings and fields explain the intrinsic disorder in data. The spin glass model explains how the weight parameters interact with each other during pre-training, and further clarifies why an unseen function can be predicted by providing only a prompt yet without further training. Our theory reveals that for single-instance learning, increasing the task diversity leads to the emergence of in-context learning, by allowing the Boltzmann distribution to converge to a unique correct solution of weight parameters. Therefore the pre-trained transformer displays a prediction power in a novel prompt setting. The proposed analytically tractable model thus offers a promising avenue for thinking about how to interpret many intriguing but puzzling properties of large language models.

Title: Borophane as substrate for adsorption of He-4: A journey across dimensionality
Authors: Stefania De Palo, Saverio Moroni, Francesco Ancilotto, Pierluigi Silvestrelli, Luciano Reatto
Abstract: In search of substrates for adsorption of He atoms allowing for novel quantum phases in restricted geometry we study the case of borophane. We focus on two allotropes of borophane, alpha-4H and Rect-2H. With a suitable Density Functional Theory we characterize the adsorption potential of a He atom on such crystalline substrates finding its corrugation, the preferential adsorption sites and the energy barrier between sites. Rect-2H borophane is particularly interesting due to thepresence of ridges in the adsorption potential with modest energy barriers in one direction of the basal plane and much higher barrier in the orthogonal direction, thus forming channels for motion of the adsorbed atoms. We study the adsorption of He-4 on Rect-2H borophane using Path Integral Monte Carlo simulations. In the first adsorbed layer the He-4 atoms are rather delocalized along a channel with no exchanges between channels. This strong anisotropy is present also in the first few additional adsorption layers of He-4 with presence of ordered and of disordered regions. In the second and the fifth layers at low temperature we find superfluidity on the length scale of the simulated systems. In the second layer the superfluidity is one-dimensional along the grooves. In the fifth layer the state is a strongly anisotropic two-dimensional superfluid at low coverage, with a crossover to an isotropic one at layer completion. Starting from the sixth layer the adsorbed He-4 film evolves toward a three-dimensional superfluid. Our main prediction is that Rect-2H borophane as a substrate will allow to probe 1D superfluidity in the second absorption layer, as well as the evolution from a 2D anisotropic superfluid to an isotropic one in the fifth layer, and eventually the onset of 3D superfluidity for higher coverages.

Title: Conductance properties of an $α$-$T_3$ Corbino disk
Authors: Mijanur Islam, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: In this work, we investigate an $\alpha$-$T_3$ lattice in the form of a Corbino disk, characterized by inner and outer radii $R_1$ and $R_2$, threaded by a tunable magnetic flux. Through exact (analytic) solution of the stationary Dirac-Weyl equation, we compute the transmission probability of the carriers and hence obtain the conductance features for $0<\alpha \leq 1$ ($\alpha$ denotes the strength of the hopping between the central atom and one of the other two) which allows ascertaining the role of the flat band, alongwith scrutinizing the transport features from graphene to a dice lattice. Our results reveal periodic Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in the conductance, reminiscent of the utility of the Corbino disk as an electron pump. Further, these results are strongly influenced by parameters, such as, doping level, ratio of the inner and outer radii, magnetic flux, and $\alpha$. Additionally, complex quantum interference effect resulting in the possible emergence of higher harmonic modes and split-peak structures in the conductance, become prominent for smaller $\alpha$ values and larger ratios of the radii. We also find that, away from the charge-neutrality point (zero doping), the conductance oscillations are more pronounced and sensitive to the various parameters, with the corresponding behaviour largely governed via the evanescent wave transport. The Fano factor reveals distinct transport regimes, transitioning from Poissonian to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha < 1$, and from ballistic to pseudo-diffusive for $\alpha = 1$. This setup, thus serves as a fertile ground for studying the generation of quantum Hall current and Aharonov-Bohm (AB) oscillations in a flat band system, alongwith demonstrating intricate appearance of higher harmonics in electron transport.

Title: 3D Nanoscale Electromechanical Imaging with Interferometric Atomic Force Microscopy
Authors: Roger Proksch, Ryan Wagner
Abstract: Forces acting between an Atomic Force Microscope (AFM) tip and sample are three dimensional. Despite this, most AFM force measurements are confined to one or two dimensions. Extending AFM force measurements into three dimensions has previously required complex, difficult and time-consuming workflows. Here, we demonstrate an accurate, interferometric method for quantifying the full, three-dimensional response of an AFM tip to localized forces. We demonstrate this approach on a series of piezoelectric materials and show that this approach yields quantitative 3D measurement independent of the sample orientation beneath the tip. This approach simplifies existing, angle-resolved piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) techniques. Our measurements benefit from the greatly reduced noise floor (5 fm per root Hz) and intrinsic accuracy of our interferometric measurements. One important result is that the vertical piezo sensitivity was systematically 2 to 3 times larger than the in-plane piezo sensitivities. A simple analysis of vertical and lateral contact stiffnesses, due to the difference in the Young (vertical) and Shear (lateral) sample yields a factor of 2.5, in good agreement with the measurements. While this work was confined to ferroelectric materials, it provides a general workflow and framework for other AFM based mechanical measurements.

Abstract: In this article, we present results of our recent work of epitaxially-grown aluminum (epi-Al) on antimonide heterostructures, where the epi-Al thin film is grown at either room temperature or below zero $^o$C. A sharp superconducting transition at $T \sim 1.3$ K is observed in these epi-Al films. We further show that supercurrent states are realized in Josephson junctions fabricated in the epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures with mobility $\mu \sim 1.0 \times 10^6$ cm$^2$/Vs. These results clearly demonstrate we have achieved growing high-quality epi-Al/antimonide heterostructures, a promising platform for the exploration of Josephson junction effects for quantum information science and microelectronics applications.

Title: Magnetization induced skyrmion dynamics of a spin-orbit-coupled spinor condensate under sinusoidally varying magnetic field
Authors: Arpana Saboo, Soumyadeep Halder, Mithun Thudiyangal, Sonjoy Majumder
Abstract: We theoretically explore the spin texture dynamics of a harmonically trapped spin-1 Bose-Einstein condensate with Rashba spin-orbit coupling and ferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions under a sinusoidally varying magnetic field along the $x$-direction. This interplay yields an intrinsic spin texture in the ground state, forming a linear chain of alternating skyrmions at the saddle points. Our study analyzes the spin-mixing dynamics for both a freely evolving and a controlled longitudinal magnetization. The spin-1 system exhibits the Einstein-de Hass effect for the first case, for which an exchange between the total orbital angular momentum and the spin angular momentum is observed, resulting in minimal oscillations about the initial position of the skyrmion chain. However, for the fixed magnetization dynamics, the skyrmion chain exhibits ample angular oscillations about the equilibrium position, with the temporary formation of new skyrmions and anti-skyrmions to facilitate the oscillatory motion. Keeping the magnetization constant, this contrast now stems from the exchange between the canonical and spin-dependent contribution to the orbital angular momentum. The variation in canonical angular momentum is linked to the angular oscillations, while the spin-dependent angular momentum accounts for the creation or annihilation of skyrmions. We confirm the presence of scissor mode excitations in the spin texture due to the angular skyrmion oscillations.

Title: Unconventional Josephson supercurrent diode effect induced by chiral spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Andreas Costa, Osamu Kanehira, Hiroaki Matsueda, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: Chiral materials lacking mirror symmetry can exhibit unconventional spin-orbit fields, including fully momentum-aligned radial Rashba fields as seen in twisted van der Waals homobilayers. We theoretically study Cooper-pair transfer in superconductor/ferromagnet/superconductor Josephson junctions with crossed (tangential and radial) interfacial Rashba fields. We find that their interplay leads to what we call the unconventional supercurrent diode effect (SDE), where supercurrent rectification occurs even with collinear (with respect to the current) barrier magnetization, not possible for conventional spin-orbit fields. This SDE, distinct from conventional Rashba-induced effects on Cooper-pair momenta, arises from the spin precession in the magnetic barrier. We propose it as a sensitive probe of chiral spin textures.

Title: Switchable Skyrmion-Antiskyrmion Tubes in Rhombohedral BaTiO$_\mathrm{3}$ and Related Materials
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Louis Bastogne, Sriram Anand, Miao Yu, Xu He, Philippe Ghosez
Abstract: Skyrmions are stable topological textures that have garnered substantial attention within the ferroelectric community for their exotic functional properties. While previous studies have questioned the feasibility of [001]$_{\text{pc}}$ skyrmion tubes in rhombohedral BaTiO$_3$ due to the high energy cost of 180$^\circ$ domain walls, we demonstrate here their stabilization with topological charges of $\mathcal{Q} = \pm 1$ from density functional theory and second-principles calculations. By enabling extensive vortex and antivortex polarization configurations, the expected prohibitive energetic barriers are overcomed while preserving the topological nature of the structures. Notably, we extend these findings to demonstrate the appearance of skyrmion and antiskyrmion tubes in other related materials, highlighting their broader relevance. Furthermore, our computational experiments indicate that these structures can be directly stabilized and reversibly switched by applied electric fields, establishing a straightforward route for their practical realization and functional control in nanoelectronic devices.

Title: Geometric transport signatures of strained multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Varsha Subramanyan, Shi-Zeng Lin, Avadh Saxena
Abstract: The minimal coupling of strain to Dirac and Weyl semimetals, and its modeling as a pseudo-gauge field has been extensively studied, resulting in several proposed topological transport signatures. In this work, we study the effects of strain on higher winding number Weyl semimetals and show that strain is not a pseudo-gauge field for any winding number larger than one. We focus on the double-Weyl semimetal as an illustrative example to show that the application of strain splits the higher winding number Weyl nodes and produces an anisotropic Fermi surface. Specifically, the Fermi surface of the double-Weyl semimetal acquires nematic order. By extending chiral kinetic theory for such nematic fields, we determine the effective gauge fields acting on the system and show how strain induces anisotropy and affects the geometry of the semi-classical phase space of the double-Weyl semimetal. Further, the strain-induced deformation of the Weyl nodes results in transport signatures related to the covariant coupling of the strain tensor to the geometric tensor associated with the Weyl nodes giving rise to strain-dependent dissipative corrections to the longitudinal as well as the Hall conductance. Thus, by extension, we show that in multi-Weyl semimetals, strain produces geometric signatures rather than topological signatures. Further, we highlight that the most general way to view strain is as a symmetry-breaking field rather than a pseudo-gauge field.

Title: 1/5 and 1/3 magnetization plateaux in the spin 1/2 chain system YbAlO3
Authors: P. Mokhtari, S. Galeski, U. Stockert, S. E. Nikitin, R. Wawrzynczak, R. Kuechler, M. Brando, L. Vasylechko, O. A. Starykh, E. Hassinger
Abstract: Quasi-one-dimensional magnets can host an ordered longitudinal spin-density wave state (LSDW) in magnetic field at low temperature, when longitudinal correlations are strengthened by Ising anisotropies. In the S = 1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet YbAlO3 this happens via Ising-like interchain interactions. Here, we report the first experimental observation of magnetization plateaux at 1/5 and 1/3 of the saturation value via thermal transport and magnetostriction measurements in YbAlO3. We present a phenomenological theory of the plateau states that describes them as islands of commensurability within an otherwise incommensurate LSDW phase and explains their relative positions within the LSDW phase and their relative extent in a magnetic field. Notably, the plateaux are stabilised by ferromagnetic interchain interactions in YbAlO3 and consistently are absent in other quasi-1D magnets such as BaCo2V2O8 with antiferromagnetic interchain interactions. We also report a small, step-like increase of the magnetostriction coefficient, indicating a weak phase transition of unknown origin in the high-field phase just below the saturation.

Title: Intrinsic (Axion) Statistical Topological Insulator
Authors: Xi Chen, Fa-Jie Wang, Zhen Bi, Zhi-Da Song
Abstract: Ensembles that respect symmetries on average exhibit richer topological states than those in pure states with exact symmetries, leading to the concept of average symmetry-protected topological states (ASPTs). The free-fermion counterpart of ASPT is the so-called statistical topological insulator (STI) in disordered ensembles. In this work, we demonstrate the existence of an intrinsic STI, which has no clean counterpart. Using a real space construction (topological crystal), we find an axion STI characterized by the average axion angle $\bar{\theta}=\pi$, protected by an average $C_4T$ symmetry with $(C_4T)^4=1$. While the exact $C_{4}T$ symmetry reverses the sign of $\theta$ angle, and hence seems to protect a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification of $\theta\!=\!0,\pi$, we prove that the $\theta\!=\!\pi$ state cannot be realized in the clean limit if $(C_{4}T)^4 \!=\! 1$. Therefore, the axion STI lacks band insulator correspondence and is thus intrinsic. To illustrate this state, we construct a lattice model and numerically explore its phase diagram, identifying an axion STI phase separated from both band insulators and trivial Anderson insulators by a metallic phase, revealing the intrinsic nature of the STI. We also argue that the intrinsic STI is robust against electron-electron interactions. Our work thus provides the first intrinsic crystalline ASPT and its lattice realization.

Title: Unconventional Spin-orbit Torques by Two-dimensional Multilayered MXenes for Future Nonvolatile Magnetic Memories
Authors: Prabhat Kumar, Yoshio Miura, Yoshinori Kotani, Akiho Sumiyoshiya, Tetsuya Nakamura, Gaurav K. Shukla, Shinji Isogami
Abstract: MXenes have attracted considerable attention in recent years owing to their two-dimensional (2D) layered structures with various functionalities similar to those of graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. To open a new application field for MXenes in the realm of electronic devices, such as ultrahigh-integrated magnetic memory, we have developed a spin-orbit torque (SOT) bilayer structure comprising bare MXene of Cr2N: substrate//Cr2N/[Co/Pt]3/MgO using the magnetron sputtering technique. We demonstrated field-free current-induced magnetization switching (CIMS) in the bilayer structure, regardless of the charge current directions with respect to the mirror symmetry lines of Cr2N crystal. This is a specific characteristic for the 2D MXene-based SOT-devices, originating from an unconventional out-of-plane SOT. As the SOT efficiency increases with increasing the Cr2N thickness, the first-principles calculations predict an intrinsic orbital-Hall conductivity with the dominant out-of-plane component, comparing to the spin-Hall conductivity in the Cr2N. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism reveals the out-of-plane uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N layer at the interface, induced by contact with the Co in the [Co/Pt]3 ferromagnetic layer. Therefore, the intrinsic bulk orbital Hall effect in MXene and the interfacial contribution such as spin-filtering-like effect owing to uncompensated magnetic moment of Cr are considered as possible major mechanisms for the unconventional out-of-plane SOT in the device, rather than a crystal symmetry and/or an interlayer exchange coupling.

Title: Control of ferroelectric domain wall dynamics by point defects: Insights from ab initio based simulations
Authors: Sheng-Han Teng, Aris Dimou, Benjamin Udofia, Majid Ghasemi, Markus Stricker, Anna Grünebohm
Abstract: The control of ferroelectric domain walls and their dynamics on the nanoscale becomes increasingly important for advanced nanoelectronics and novel computing schemes. One common approach to tackle this challenge is the pinning of walls by point defects. The fundamental understanding on how different defects influence the wall dynamics is, however, incomplete. In particular, the important class of defect dipoles in acceptor-doped ferroelectrics is currently underrepresented in theoretical work. In this study, we combine molecular dynamics simulations based on an \textit{ab\ initio}-derived effective Hamiltonian and methods from materials informatics, and analyze the impact of these defects on the motion of 180$^{\circ}$ domain walls in tetragonal BaTiO$_3$. We show how these defects can act as local pinning centers and restoring forces on the domain structure. Furthermore, we reveal how walls can flow around sparse defects by nucleation and growth of dipole clusters, and how pinning, roughening and bending of walls depend on the defect distribution. Surprisingly, the interaction between acceptor dopants and walls is short-ranged. We show that the limiting factor for the nucleation processes underlying wall motion is the defect-free area in front of the wall.

Title: Strong shape-dependent intensity of inelastic light scattering by gold nanocrystals
Authors: Lucien Saviot, Vincent Laude
Abstract: We present a numerical approach to calculate inelastic light scattering spectra from gold nanocrystals, based on the finite element method. This approach is validated by comparison with previous analytic calculations for spherically symmetric scatterers. Superellipsoid nanocrystals are considered in order to smoothly vary the shape from octahedra to cubes via spheres, while preserving cubic symmetry. Spectra are calculated and discussed taking into account the irreducible representation of the involved vibration modes. A strong increase in the inelastically scattered light intensity is observed for small variations of the shape around the sphere. This increase is related to variations of the electric field inside the nanocrystals, which are very small for small nanospheres but increase quickly for non-spherical nanocrystals. This strong dependence with shape must be taken into account when interpreting experimental spectra acquired from inhomogeneous ensembles of nanocrystals whose shape dispersion are usually neglected. The overall changes in the spectra when varying the shape of the nanocrystals provide additional insight into previously published results. Preliminary calculations for chiral shapes further show a significant difference between spectra obtained with right or left circularly polarized light.

Title: Phase diagram of the hard-sphere potential model in three and four dimensions using a pseudo-hard-sphere potential
Authors: Edwin A. Bedolla-Montiel, Ramón A. Castañeda-Cerdán, Ramón Castañeda-Priego
Abstract: The hard-sphere potential has become a cornerstone in the study of both molecular and complex fluids. Despite its mathematical simplicity, its implementation in fixed time-step molecular simulations remains a formidable challenge due to the discontinuity at contact. To circumvent the issues associated with the ill-defined force at contact, a continuous potential--referred to here as the pseudo-hard-sphere (pHS) potential--has recently been proposed [J. Chem, Phys. 149, 164907 (2018)]. This potential is constructed to match the second virial coefficient of the hard-sphere potential and is expected to mimic its thermodynamic properties. However, this hypothesis has only been partially validated within the fluid region of the phase diagram for hard-sphere dispersions in two and three dimensions. In this contribution, we examine the ability of the continuous pHS potential to reproduce the equation of state of a hard-sphere fluid, not only in the fluid phase but also across the fluid-solid coexistence region. Our focus is primarily on hard-sphere systems in three and four dimensions. We compare the results obtained from Brownian dynamics simulations of the pHS potential with those derived from refined event-driven simulations of the corresponding hard-sphere potential. Furthermore, we provide a comparative analysis with theoretical equations of state based on both mean-field and integral equation approximations.

Title: Theoretical Predictions of MB5N5: Atom-Stuffed Boronitride Clathrate Cages Derived from the High-Pressure Superhydride
Authors: Nisha Geng, Giacomo Scilla, Eva Zurek
Abstract: This study investigates 198 MX5Y5 (X, Y = B, C, or N) clathrate-like structures derived from MH10 superhydrides using high-throughput Density Functional Theory (DFT) geometry optimizations and phonon calculations. A wide variety of electropositive and electronegative encapsulated atoms were considered. From all of the studied systems only 34 MB5N5 phases were found to be dynamically stable at ambient pressure. The highest 1-atmosphere superconducting critical transition temperature was predicted for FB5N5. However, ab initio molecular dynamics simulations revealed that all of the identified superconducting phases decompose by 300~K at 1~atm, while only eleven semiconducting phases remained thermally stable. Our findings underscore the critical role of kinetic and thermal stability in predicting viable superconductors. The electronic structure of the MB5N5 compounds were rationalized in terms of electron donating and withdrawing intercalants, and machine-learning based predictions of their mechanical properties were compared with those of an empty boronitride cage.

Title: Journey from the Wilson exact RG towards the Wegner-Morris Fokker-Planck RG and the Carosso field-coarsening via Langevin stochastic processes
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: Within the Wilson RG of 'incomplete integration' as a function of the effective RG-time $t$, the non-linear differential RG-flow for the energy $E_t[\phi(.)]$ translates for the probability distribution $P_t[\phi(.)] \sim e^{- E_t[\phi(.)]} $ into the linear Fokker-Planck RG-flow associated to independent non-identical Ornstein-Uhlenbeck processes for the Fourier modes. The corresponding Langevin stochastic differential equations for the real-space field $\phi_t(\vec x)$ have been recently interpreted by Carosso as genuine infinitesimal coarsening-transformations that are the analog of spin-blocking, and whose irreversible character is essential to overcome the paradox of the naive description of the Wegner-Morris Continuity-Equation for the RG-flow as a meaningless infinitesimal change of variables in the partition function integral. This interpretation suggests to consider new RG-schemes, in particular the Carosso RG where the Langevin SDE corresponds to the stochastic heat equation also known as the Edwards-Wilkinson dynamics. After a pedestrian self-contained introduction to this stochastic formulation of RG-flows, we focus on the case where the field theory is defined on the large volume $L^d$ with periodic boundary conditions, in order to distinguish between extensive and intensives observables while keeping the translation-invariance. Since the empirical magnetization $m_e \equiv \frac{1}{L^d} \int_{L^d} d^d \vec x \ \phi(\vec x) $ is an intensive variable corresponding to the zero-momentum Fourier coefficient of the field, its probability distribution $p_L(m_e)$ can be obtained from the gradual integration over all the other Fourier coefficients associated to non-vanishing-momenta via an appropriate adaptation of the Carosso stochastic RG, in order to obtain the large deviation properties with respect to the volume $L^d$.

Title: Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$
Authors: Yao Yang
Abstract: Altermagnets represent a novel class of magnetic materials that integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, providing a rich platform for exploring the physical properties of multiferroic this http URL work demonstrates that $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers ($\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}$) are two-dimensional ferroelectric altermagnets, as confirmed by symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations. $\mathrm{VOI_2}$ monolayer exhibits a strong magnetoelectric coupling coefficient ($\alpha_S \approx 1.208 \times 10^{-6}~\mathrm{s/m}$), with spin splitting in the electronic band structure tunable by both electric and magnetic fields. Additionally, the absence of inversion symmetry in noncentrosymmetric crystals enables significant nonlinear optical effects, such as shift current (SC). The $x$-direction component of SC exhibits a ferroicity-driven switching behavior. Moreover, the $\sigma^{yyy}$ component exhibits an exceptionally large spin SC of $330.072~\mathrm{\mu A/V^2}$. These findings highlight the intricate interplay between magnetism and ferroelectricity, offering versatile tunability of electronic and optical properties. $\mathrm{VOX_2}$ monolayers provide a promising platform for advancing two-dimensional multiferroics, paving the way for energy-efficient memory devices, nonlinear optical applications and opto-spintronics.

Title: Chiral order emergence driven by quenched disorder
Authors: Coraline Letouze, Pascal Viot, Laura Messio
Abstract: Quenched disorder is expected to destroy order, such as when a random field is applied in a 2-dimensional magnetic system. Even when order exists in the presence of disorder, it is usually only the survival of the order of the clean model. We present here a surprising phenomenon where an order, driven by quenched disorder, emerges, that has nothing in common with the order present in the clean model. It's a new type of order by disorder that differs from the usual thermal or quantum one. The classical Heisenberg model on the $J_1-J_3$ kagome lattice is studied by parallel tempering Monte Carlo simulations, with magnetic site vacancies. After analyzing the effect of a few impurities on the ground state, favoring non-coplanar configurations, we show the emergence of a low-temperature chiral phase and the progressive destruction of the collinear $q=4$ Potts order, the only order present in the clean system.

Title: Energy Bands and Breakdown Characteristics in Al2O3/UWBG AlGaN Heterostructures
Authors: Seungheon Shin, Kyle Liddy, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Siddharth Rajan
Abstract: We report on energy bands and breakdown characteristics of Al2O3 dielectrics on ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN heterostructures. Metal-dielectric-semiconductor structures are important to sustain high fields needed for future high-performance UWBG transistors. Using systematic experiments, we determined the fixed charge density (> 1013 cm-2), the dielectric/interface, and electric fields in the oxide of under flat-band conditions in the semiconductor. Low gate-to-drain leakage current of up to 5 x 10-7 A/cm2 were obtained in the metal-oxide-semiconductor structures. In lateral metal-semiconductor-insulator test structures, breakdown voltage exceeding 1 kV was obtained with a channel sheet charge density of 1.27 x 1013 cm-2. The effective peak electric field and average breakdown field were estimated to be > 4.27 MV/cm and 1.99 MV/cm, respectively. These findings demonstrate the potential of Al2O2 integration for enhancing the breakdown performance of UWBG AlGaN HEMTs.

Title: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity: stability and attractors in slip rate driven processes
Authors: Jalal Smiri, Oguz Umut Salman, Ioan R. Ionescu
Abstract: Dislocation-density based crystal plasticity (CP) models are introduced to account for the microstructral changes throughout the deformation process, enabling more quantitative predictions of the deformation process compared to slip-system resistance-based plasticity models. In this work, we present a stability analysis of slip rate driven processes for some established dislocation density-based models, including the Kocks and Mecking (KM) model and its variants. Our analysis can be generalized to any type of dislocation density model, providing a broader framework for understanding the stability of such systems. Interestingly, we demonstrate that even size-independent models can exhibit size-dependent effects through variations in initial dislocation density. Notably, the initial dislocation density significantly influences material hardening or softening responses. To further explore these phenomena, we conduct numerical simulations of micro-pillar compression using an Eulerian crystal plasticity framework. Our results show that dislocation-density-based CP models effectively capture microstructural evolution in small-scale materials, offering critical insights for the design of miniaturized mechanical devices and advanced materials in nanotechnology.

Title: Interfacial Heat Transport via Evanescent Radiation by Hot Electrons
Authors: William D. Hutchins, Saman Zare, Mehran Habibzadeh, Sheila Edalatpour, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: We predict an additional thermal transport pathway across metal/non-metal interfaces with large electron-phonon non-equilibrium via evanescent radiative heat transfer. In such systems, electron scattering processes vary drastically and can be leveraged to guide heat across interfaces via radiative heat transport without engaging the lattice directly. We employ the formalism of fluctuational electrodynamics to simulate the spectral radiative heat flux across the interface of a metal film and a non-metal substrate. We find that the radiative conductance can exceed 300 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ at an electron temperature of 5000 K for an emitting tungsten film on a hexagonal boron nitride substrate, becoming comparable to its conductive counterpart. This allows for a more holistic approach to the heat flow across interfaces, accounting for electron-phonon non-equilibrium and ultrafast near-field phonon-polariton coupling.

Title: Optical spatial dispersion via Wannier interpolation
Authors: Andrea Urru, Ivo Souza, Óscar Pozo Ocaña, Stepan S. Tsirkin, David Vanderbilt
Abstract: We present a numerical implementation, based on Wannier interpolation, of a Kubo-Greenwood formalism for computing the spatially dispersive optical conductivity in crystals at first order in the wave vector of light. This approach is more efficient than direct $\textit{ab initio}$ methods because, with less computational cost, it allows for a much finer sampling of reciprocal space, resulting in better resolved spectra. Moreover, Wannier interpolation avoids errors arising from truncation of the sums over conduction bands when evaluating the spatially dispersive optical matrix elements. We validate our method by computing the optical activity spectrum of selected crystals, both polar (GaN) and chiral (trigonal Te, trigonal Se, and $\alpha$-quartz), and comparing with existing literature.

Title: Observing Nucleation and Crystallization of Rocksalt LiF from Molten State through Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Refined Machine-Learned Force Field
Authors: Boyuan Xu, Liyi Bai, Shenzhen Xu, Qisheng Wu
Abstract: Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a critical component for stabilizing lithium metal anode and high-voltage cathodes towards the next-generation high-energy-density lithium batteries. Recent modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below about 550 K (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to experimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below about 800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses--alongside energies and forces--in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF under the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects are often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial stresses during the training of MLFF to enable accurate modeling of solid-state systems.

Title: High Breakdown Electric Field (> 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors
Authors: Seungheon Shin, Hridibrata Pal, Jon Pratt, John Niroula, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Tomás Palacios, Siddharth Rajan
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage > 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics.

Title: Derivation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov and quantum Boltzmann equations in an interacting Bose gas
Authors: Thomas Chen, Michael Hott
Abstract: Our previous work [37] presented a rigorous derivation of quantum Boltzmann equations near a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC). Here, we extend it with a complete characterization of the leading order fluctuation dynamics. For this purpose, we correct the latter via an appropriate Bogoliubov rotation, in partial analogy to the approach by Grillakis-Machedon et al. [59], in addition to the Weyl transformation applied in [37]. Based on the analysis of the third order expansion of the BEC wave function, and the second order expansions of the pair-correlations, we show that through a renormalization strategy, various contributions to the effective Hamiltonian can be iteratively eliminated by an appropriate choice of the Weyl and Bogoliubov transformations. This leads to a separation of renormalized Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov (HFB) equations and quantum Boltzmann equations. A multitude of terms that were included in the error term in [37] are now identified as contributions to the HFB renormalization terms. Thereby, the error bound in the work at hand is improved significantly. To the given order, it is now sharp, and matches the order or magnitude expected from scaling considerations. Consequently, we extend the time of validity to $t\sim (\log N)^2$ compared to $t\sim (\log N/\log \log N)^2$ before. We expect our approach to be extensible to smaller orders in $\frac1N$.

Title: Exponential rate of epidemic spreading on complex networks
Authors: Samuel Cure, Florian G. Pflug, Simone Pigolotti
Abstract: The initial phase of an epidemic is often characterized by an exponential increase in the number of infected individuals. In this paper, we predict the exponential spreading rate of an epidemic on a complex network. We first find an expression of the reproduction number for a network, based on the degree distribution, the network assortativity, and the level of clustering. We then connect this reproduction number and the disease infectiousness to the spreading rate. Our result holds for a broad range of networks, apart from networks with very broad degree distribution, where no clear exponential regime is present. Our theory bridges the gap between classic epidemiology and the theory of complex networks, with broad implications for model inference and policy making.

Title: Quantum adiabatic optimization with Rydberg arrays: localization phenomena and encoding strategies
Authors: Lisa Bombieri, Zhongda Zeng, Roberto Tricarico, Rui Lin, Simone Notarnicola, Madelyn Cain, Mikhail D. Lukin, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic optimization seeks to solve combinatorial problems using quantum dynamics, requiring the Hamiltonian of the system to align with the problem of interest. However, these Hamiltonians are often incompatible with the native constraints of quantum hardware, necessitating encoding strategies to map the original problem into a hardware-conformant form. While the classical overhead associated with such mappings is easily quantifiable and typically polynomial in problem size, it is much harder to quantify their overhead on the quantum algorithm, e.g., the transformation of the adiabatic timescale. In this work, we address this challenge on the concrete example of the encoding scheme proposed in [Nguyen et al., PRX Quantum 4, 010316 (2023)], which is designed to map optimization problems on arbitrarily connected graphs into Rydberg atom arrays. We consider the fundamental building blocks underlying this encoding scheme and determine the scaling of the minimum gap with system size along adiabatic protocols. Even when the original problem is trivially solvable, we find that the encoded problem can exhibit an exponentially closing minimum gap. We show that this originates from a quantum coherent effect, which gives rise to an unfavorable localization of the ground-state wavefunction. On the QuEra Aquila neutral atom machine, we observe such localization and its effect on the success probability of finding the correct solution to the encoded optimization problem. Finally, we propose quantum-aware modifications of the encoding scheme that avoid this quantum bottleneck and lead to an exponential improvement in the adiabatic performance. This highlights the crucial importance of accounting for quantum effects when designing strategies to encode classical problems onto quantum platforms.

Title: Scaling Up Purcell-Enhanced Self-Assembled Nanoplasmonic Perovskite Scintillators into the Bulk Regime

Abstract: Scintillators convert high-energy radiation into detectable photons and play a crucial role in medical imaging and security applications. The enhancement of scintillator performance through nanophotonics and nanoplasmonics, specifically using the Purcell effect, has shown promise but has so far been limited to ultrathin scintillator films because of the localized nature of this effect. This study introduces a method to expand the application of nanoplasmonic scintillators to the bulk regime. By integrating 100-nm-sized plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles with perovskite scintillator nanocrystals, we enable nanoplasmonic scintillators to function effectively within bulk-scale devices. We experimentally demonstrate power and decay rate enhancements of up to (3.20 $\pm$ 0.20) and (4.20 $\pm$ 0.31) folds for plasmonic spheroid and cuboid nanoparticles, respectively, in a 5-mm thick CsPbBr$_{3}$ nanocrystal-polymer scintillator at RT. Theoretical modeling also predicts similar enhancements of up to (2.26 $\pm$ 0.31) and (3.02 $\pm$ 0.69) folds for the same nanoparticle shapes and dimensions. Moreover, we demonstrate a (2.07 $\pm$ 0.39) fold increase in light yield under $^{241}$Am $\gamma$-excitation. These findings provide a viable pathway for utilizing nanoplasmonics to enhance bulk scintillator devices, advancing radiation detection technology.

Title: Effects of noise-induced coherence on the performance of a four-level laser heat engine
Authors: Kirandeep Kaur
Abstract: In this work, we study the effect of noise-induced coherence on the performance analysis of a degenerate four-level quantum heat engine with particular focus on the universal nature of efficiency, which refers to the appearance of the first two universal terms $\eta_C/2$ and $\eta_C^2/8$ in series expansion of the efficiency at maximum power under a left-right symmetry in the system. Firstly, for a two-parameter optimization scheme, we derive an analytic expression for the efficiency at maximum power for the near-equilibrium condition and show that presence of noise-induced coherence breaks the left-right symmetry of the system. However, when the operation of the engine is restricted to either high-temperature or low-temperature regime, we discuss the conditions under which the left-right symmetry can be retained in each case, giving rise to the universal characteristic of efficiency. In case of one-parameter optimization, we show that while the universality of the first linear term $\eta_c/2$ is robust and holds consistently across all conditions, the universality of the quadratic term $\eta_C^2/8$ depends on the constraints imposed on the control parameters. Finally, we examine the behavior of power as a function of noise-induced coherence parameter highlighting the role of matter-field coupling in determining the suitable operation regime for the heat engine to reap the benefits of noise-induced coherence.

Title: Stabilizer Rényi Entropy and Conformal Field Theory
Authors: Masahiro Hoshino, Masaki Oshikawa, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: Understanding universal aspects of many-body systems is one of the central themes in modern physics. Recently, the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) has emerged as a computationally tractable measure of nonstabilizerness, a crucial resource for fault-tolerant universal quantum computation. While numerical results suggested that the SRE in critical states can exhibit universal behavior, its comprehensive theoretical understanding has remained elusive. In this work, we develop a field-theoretical framework for the SRE in a $(1+1)$-dimensional many-body system and elucidate its universal aspects using boundary conformal field theory. We demonstrate that the SRE is equivalent to a participation entropy in the Bell basis of a doubled Hilbert space, which can be calculated from the partition function of a replicated field theory with the interlayer line defect created by the Bell-state measurements. This identification allows us to characterize the universal contributions to the SRE on the basis of the data of conformal boundary conditions imposed on the replicated theory. We find that the SRE of the entire system contains a universal size-independent term determined by the noninteger ground-state degeneracy known as the g-factor. In contrast, we show that the mutual SRE exhibits the logarithmic scaling with a universal coefficient given by the scaling dimension of a boundary condition changing operator, which elucidates the origin of universality previously observed in numerical results. As a concrete demonstration, we present a detailed analysis of the Ising criticality, where we analytically derive the universal quantities at arbitrary Rényi indices and numerically validate them with high accuracy by employing tensor network methods. These results establish a field-theoretical approach to understanding the universal features of nonstabilizerness in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Multimodal machine learning with large language embedding model for polymer property prediction
Authors: Tianren Zhang, Dai-Bei Yang
Abstract: Contemporary large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4 and Llama, have harnessed extensive computational power and diverse text corpora to achieve remarkable proficiency in interpreting and generating domain-specific content, including materials science. To leverage the domain knowledge embedded within these models, we propose a simple yet effective multimodal architecture, PolyLLMem, which integrates text embeddings generated by Llama 3 with molecular structure embeddings derived from Uni-Mol, for polymer properties prediction tasks. In our model, Low-rank adaptation (LoRA) layers were also incorporated during the property prediction tasks to refine the embeddings based on our limited polymer dataset, thereby enhancing their chemical relevance for polymer SMILES representation. This balanced fusion of fine-tuned textual and structural information enables PolyLLMem to accurately predict a variety of polymer properties despite the scarcity of training data. Its performance is comparable to, and in some cases exceeds, that of graph-based models, as well as transformer-based models that typically require pretraining on millions of polymer samples. These findings demonstrate that LLM, such as Llama, can effectively capture chemical information encoded in polymer PSMILES, and underscore the efficacy of multimodal fusion of LLM embeddings and molecular structure embeddings in overcoming data scarcity and accelerating the discovery of advanced polymeric materials.

Title: Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals
Authors: Sergey G. Menabde, Yongjun Lim, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso-González, Jacob T. Heiden, Heerin Noh, Seungwoo Lee, Min Seok Jang
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.
