Title: Quasiclassical electron transport in topological Weyl semimetals
Authors: Azaz Ahmad
Abstract: Weyl fermions are powerful yet simple entities that connect geometry, topology, and physics. While their existence as fundamental particles is still uncertain, growing evidence shows they emerge as quasiparticles in special materials called Weyl semimetals (WSMs). These materials possess unique electronic properties and hold promise for future technologies. This thesis investigates how electrons behave in WSMs, focusing on the chiral anomaly (CA). The CA remains central in condensed matter physics, typically observed via longitudinal magnetoconductance (LMC) and the planar Hall effect (PHE). Although finite intervalley scattering can reverse the LMC sign, we identify another mechanism: a smooth cutoff in the linear dispersion, inherent to real Weyl materials, introduces nonlinearity that causes negative LMC even without intervalley scattering. Using a lattice model of tilted Weyl fermions and the Boltzmann approximation, we explore LMC and PHE, mapping phase diagrams in key parameter spaces. We also study the effects of strain, which acts as an axial magnetic field and influences diffusive transport. Our results show that strain-induced gauge fields can cause a strong LMC sign-reversal, unlike external fields which need intervalley scattering. The interplay of strain and external fields produces rich LMC behavior. We further predict distinct PHE responses due to strain. Finally, we extend the study to nonlinear transport, developing a theory for the chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect (CNLHE). In Weyl semimetals, the nonlinear Hall conductivity shows nonmonotonic behavior and strong sign-reversal with scattering. In contrast, spin-orbit coupled metals show consistently negative, quadratic responses. We also explore pseudospin-1 fermions, finding enhanced sensitivity to internode scattering, revealing new transport signatures and broadening the scope of chiral anomaly studies.

Title: Asymmetric Effects Underlying Dynamic Heterogeneity in Miscible Blends of Poly(methyl methacrylate) with Poly(ethylene oxide)
Authors: Shannon Zhang, Michael A. Webb
Abstract: The emergence of spatially variable local dynamics, or dynamic heterogeneity, is common in multicomponent polymer systems. Such heterogeneity is understood to arise from differences between the intrinsic dynamical fluctuations associated with one component versus another. However, the nature of the dynamic coupling between these components and how it depends on composition, temperature, and environmental fluctuations is not fully understood. Here, we use molecular dynamics simulations to characterize nanoscale dynamic heterogeneity in miscible blends of polyethylene oxide (PEO) and polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA) as a function of both temperature and blend composition. Probed over timescales of 100~ps, local PMMA segmental dynamics in blends align with neat PMMA when normalized by $T_\text{g}$, whereas PEO exhibits enhanced mobility caused by free-volume effects. The effects of dynamical coupling are found to be asymmetric between the extent of enhancement to PMMA and suppression of PEO dynamics based on analysis of local environment composition within blends. Asymmetric effects in the melt state are also identified over longer timescales according to a Rouse mode analysis over larger sub-chains for each species. These results provide fundamental insights into how dynamic heterogeneity manifests at the nanoscale, across conditions and compositions in miscible polymer blends. They establish a foundation for exploring whether such asymmetries are generalizable and how dynamic heterogeneity can be tuned through temperature, composition, and morphology.

Title: Thermodynamics of multiple Maxwell demons
Authors: Sandipan Dutta
Abstract: In many assembly line processes like metabolic and signaling networks in biological systems, the products of the first enzyme is the reactant for the next enzyme in the network. Working of multiple machines leads to efficient utilization of resources. Motivated by this, we investigate if multiple Maxwell demons lead to more efficient information processing. We study the phase space of multiple demons acting on an information tape based on the model of Mandal and Jarzynski [1, 2]. Their model is analytically solvable and the phase space of the device has three regions: engine, where work is delivered by writing information to the tape, erasure, where work is performed on the device to erase information on the tape, and dud, when work is performed and at the same time the information is written to the tape. For identical demons, we find that the erasure region increases at the expense of the dud region while the information engine region does not change appreciably. The efficiency of the multiple demon device increases with the number of demons in the device and saturates to the equilibrium (maximum) efficiency even at short cycle times for very large number of demons. By investigating a device with nonidentical demons acting on a tape, we identify the demon parameters that control the different regions of the phase space. Our model is well suited to study information processing in assembly line systems.

Title: Synthesis and anisotropic magnetism of singlecrystalline GdPt2Si2
Authors: Gustavo Gomes Vasques, Mateus Dutra, Pedro Caetano Sabino, Juliana Gonçalves Dias, Julian Andrés Munévar Cagigas, Adriano Reinaldo Viçoto Benvenho, Marcos A. Avila
Abstract: Single crystals of GdPt$_2$Si$_2$ were grown using the Sn flux method, crystallizing in the CaBe$_2$Ge$_2$-type tetragonal structure with space group $P4/nmm$. Electrical resistivity, specific heat, and magnetization data revealed the presence of a double magnetic transition with $T_N \approx 8.4$~K and $T_0 \approx 6.8$~K. Analysis of the specific heat data suggest amplitude-modulated and equal-moment antiferromagnetic orderings, respectively. Field-induced magnetization and magnetic susceptibility data show a metamagnetic transition in the $H \parallel a$ direction at 2~K, as well as the suppression of the magnetic transition located at $T_0$ with increasing external magnetic field. Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) shows the Gd$^{3+}$ resonance followed by a small second resonance. Peak-to-peak linewidth ($\Delta H_{pp}$) analysis reveals slight broadening at $T \sim 120$~K, indicating an increase in magnetic fluctuations at high temperatures. Ferromagnetic (FM) local polarization at high temperatures is also observed through the $g$-factor analysis, which shows a notable positive shift ($\Delta g$). Our results establish the fundamental physical properties of this material to aid in further understanding of the magnetism in the RPt$_2$Si$_2$ series and related non-centrosymmetric systems.

Title: β-Ga2O3-Based Heterojunctions: Exploring Growth Orientations and Alloying Effect
Authors: Mohamed Abdelilah Fadla, Khushabu Agrawal, Paolo La Torraca, Myrta Grüning, Karim Cherkaoui, Lorenzo Stella
Abstract: We investigate the effects of alloying and growth orientation on the properties of the ultra-wide bandgap semiconductor \beta-Ga2O3 and pseudomorphic AlGaO alloy heterojunctions. Band offsets are computed from first principles using density functional theory (DFT) with the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof hybrid functional for different Al concentrations and four growth orientations, namely (100)B, (010), (001)B, and ($\bar{2}$01). Significant variations are found and ascribed to the strained pseudomorphic alloys. The values of the band offsets are fed into technology computer-aided design (TCAD) models of Schottky barrier diodes (SBD). I-V and C-V characteristics from the TCAD models show reasonable agreement with recent experimental measurements in the forward bias region. Discrepancies in the negative bias region are expected due to the ideality of the Schottky junctions considered in this study. Our findings underscore the importance of growth orientation and strain in modelling of \beta-Ga2O3-based SBD.

Title: Approximate Excited-State Potential Energy Surfaces for Defects in Solids
Authors: Mark E. Turiansky, John L. Lyons
Abstract: A description of electron-phonon coupling at a defect or impurity is essential to characterizing and harnessing its functionality for a particular application. Electron-phonon coupling limits the amount of useful light produced by a single-photon emitter and can destroy the efficiency of optoelectronic devices by enabling defects to act as recombination centers. Information on atomic relaxations in the excited state of the center is needed to assess electron-phonon coupling but may be inaccessible due to failed convergence or computational expense. Here we develop an approximation technique to quantify electron-phonon coupling using only the forces of the excited state evaluated in the equilibrium geometry of the ground state. The approximations are benchmarked on well-studied defect systems, namely C$_{\rm N}$ in GaN, the nitrogen-vacancy center in diamond, and the carbon dimer in h-BN. We demonstrate that the zero-phonon line energy can be approximated with just a single mode, while the Huang-Rhys factor converges by including displacements up to the second nearest neighbors. This work also provides important insight into the success of the widely utilized one-dimensional accepting-mode approximation, specifically demonstrating that the accepting-mode Huang-Rhys factor is a strict upper bound on the full multidimensional Huang-Rhys factor.

Title: Kinetics of Amorphous Defect Phases Measured Through Ultrafast Nanocalorimetry
Authors: W. Streit Cunningham, Tianjiao Lei, Hannah C. Howard, Timothy J Rupert, Daniel S. Gianola
Abstract: Recognition of the role of extended defects on local phase transitions has led to the conceptualization of the defect phase, localized thermodynamically stable interfacial states that have since been applied in a myriad of material systems to realize significant enhancements in material properties. Here, we explore the kinetics of grain boundary confined amorphous defect phases, utilizing the high temperature and scanning rates afforded by ultrafast differential scanning calorimetry to apply targeted annealing/quenching treatments at high rates capable of capturing the kinetic behavior. Four Al-based nanocrystalline alloys, including two binary systems, Al-Ni and Al-Y, and two ternary systems, Al-Mg-Y and Al-Ni-Y, are selected to probe the materials design space (enthalpy of mixing, enthalpy of segregation, chemical complexity) for amorphous defect phase formation and stability, with correlative transmission electron microscopy applied to link phase evolution and grain stability to nanocalorimetry signatures. A series of targeted isothermal annealing heat treatments is utilized to construct a Time-Temperature-Transformation curve for the Al-Ni system, from which a critical cooling rate of 2,400 °C/s was determined for the grain boundary confined disordered-to-ordered transition. Finally, a thermal profile consisting of 1,000 repeated annealing sequences was created to explore the recovery of the amorphous defect phase following sequential annealing treatments, with results indicating remarkable microstructural stability after annealing at temperatures above 90% of the melting temperature. This work contributes to a deeper understanding of grain boundary localized thermodynamics and kinetics, with potential implications for the design and optimization of advanced materials with enhanced stability and performance.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of quantum matter driven by time-energy entangled photons
Authors: Giovanni Citeroni, Marco Polini, Michael Dapolito, D. N. Basov, Giacomo Mazza
Abstract: We study the dynamics of quantum matter interacting with time-energy entangled photons. We consider the stimulation of a collective mode of a two-dimensional material by means of one of the two partners of a time-energy entangled pair of photons. Using an exactly solvable model, we analyze the out-of-equilibrium properties of both light and matter degrees of freedom, and show how entanglement in the incident photons deeply modifies relevant time scales of the light-matter interaction process. We find that entanglement strongly suppresses the delay between the transmission and absorption events, which become synchronous in the limit of strongly entangled wave packets. By comparing numerical simulations with analytic modeling, we trace back this behavior to the representation of entangled wave packets in terms of a superposition of multiple train pulses containing an increasing number of ultrashort non-entangled packets. As a result, we show that the entangled driving allows the creation of a matter excitation on a time scale shorter than the temporal width of the pulse. Eventually, by analyzing temporal correlations of the excited matter degrees of freedom, we show that driving with entangled photons imprints characteristic temporal correlations of time-energy entangled modes in the matter degree of freedom.

Title: Chirality across scales in tissue dynamics
Authors: Sihan Chen, Doruk Efe Gökmen, Michel Fruchart, Miriam Krumbein, Pascal Silberzan, Victor Yashunsky, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Chiral processes that lack mirror symmetry pervade nature from enantioselective molecular interactions to the asymmetric development of organisms. An outstanding challenge at the interface between physics and biology consists in bridging the multiple scales between microscopic and macroscopic chirality. Here, we combine theory, experiments and modern inference algorithms to study a paradigmatic example of dynamic chirality transfer across scales: the generation of tissue-scale flows from subcellular forces. The distinctive properties of our microscopic graph model and the corresponding coarse-grained viscoelasticity are that (i) net cell proliferation is spatially inhomogeneous and (ii) cellular dynamics cannot be expressed as an energy gradient. To overcome the general challenge of inferring microscopic model parameters from noisy high-dimensional data, we develop a nudged automatic differentiation algorithm (NADA) that can handle large fluctuations in cell positions observed in single tissue snapshots. This data-calibrated microscopic model quantitatively captures proliferation-driven tissue flows observed at large scales in our experiments on fibroblastoma cell cultures. Beyond chirality, our inference algorithm can be used to extract interpretable graph models from limited amounts of noisy data of living and inanimate cellular systems such as networks of convection cells and flowing foams.

Title: Clustering and emergent hyperuniformity by breaking microswimmer shape and actuation symmetries
Authors: Anson G. Thambi, William E. Uspal
Abstract: Hydrodynamic interactions driven by particle activity are ubiquitous in active colloidal systems. Although these interactions are strongly influenced by the interfacial actuation mechanism and geometry of the swimming particles, theoretical understanding of how these microscopic design parameters govern collective dynamics remains limited. Here, we investigate the collective dynamics of oblate spheroidal microswimmers. Using an approximate kinetic theory and corroborating boundary element method calculations, we demonstrate that breaking symmetries in both particle shape and interfacial actuation enables the emergence of dynamically stable immotile n-particle clusters. At larger scales, the clustering process drives the system into a dynamically arrested absorbing state characterized by disordered class I hyperuniform structures. Our analysis highlights the essential role of cluster-sourced long-range flows in establishing this long-range order. Overall, our findings reveal a robust, purely hydrodynamic mechanism for hierarchical self-organization in active matter systems, providing a novel strategy for engineering multifunctional hyperuniform materials.

Title: Trion formation and ordering in the attractive SU(3) Fermi-Hubbard model
Authors: Jonathan Stepp, Eduardo Ibarra-García-Padilla, Richard T. Scalettar, Kaden R. A. Hazzard
Abstract: Recent advances in microwave shielding have increased the stability and control of large numbers of polar molecules, allowing for the first realization of a molecular Bose-Einstein condensate. Remarkably, it was also recently realized that shielded polar molecules exhibit an SU(N) symmetry among their hyperfine states, opening the door to SU(N) systems with larger N, bosonic particle statistics, and tunable interactions -- both repulsive and attractive. Motivated by these results, we have studied the SU(3) attractive Fermi-Hubbard model (FHM) on a square lattice. Using the Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) method, we explore the finite-temperature phase diagram and provide evidence for three distinct regions -- a three-component Fermi liquid (FL) region, a "trion" liquid (TL) region, and an ordered Charge Density Wave (CDW) phase. The CDW phase is stable at finite temperature (in contrast to the SU(2) CDW), while the FL to TL crossover appears to point to a quantum phase transition at zero temperature. Our method extends straightforwardly to larger N and is sign-problem free for even values of N. With these results, we demonstrate the potential physics enabled by using polar molecules as a quantum simulation platform for the attractive SU(N) FHM.

Title: Fundamentals and Advances in Transverse Thermoelectrics
Authors: Hiroto Adachi, Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Rajkumar Modak, Matthew Grayson, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: Transverse thermoelectric effects interconvert charge and heat currents in orthogonal directions due to the breaking of either time-reversal symmetry or structural symmetry, enabling simple and versatile thermal energy harvesting and solid-state cooling within single materials. In comparison to the complex module structures required for the conventional Seebeck and Peltier effects, the transverse thermoelectric effects provide the complete device structures, potentially resolving the fundamental issue of multi-module degradation of thermoelectric conversion performance. This review article provides an overview of all currently known transverse thermoelectric conversion phenomena and principles, as well as their characteristics, and reclassifies them in a unified manner. The performance of the transverse thermoelectric generator, refrigerator, and active cooler is formulated, showing that thermal boundary conditions play an essential role to discuss their behaviors. Examples of recent application research and material development in transverse thermoelectrics are also introduced, followed by a discussion of future prospects.

Title: Multi-state detection and spatial addressing in a microscope for ultracold molecules
Authors: Jonathan M. Mortlock, Adarsh P. Raghuram, Benjamin P. Maddox, Philip D. Gregory, Simon L. Cornish
Abstract: Precise measurement of the particle number, spatial distribution and internal state is fundamental to all proposed experiments with ultracold molecules both in bulk gases and optical lattices. Here, we demonstrate in-situ detection of individual molecules in a bulk sample of 87Rb133Cs molecules. Extending techniques from atomic quantum gas microscopy, we pin the molecules in a deep two-dimensional optical lattice and, following dissociation, collect fluorescence from the constituent atoms using a high-numerical-aperture objective. This enables detection of individual molecules up to the resolution of the sub-micron lattice spacing. Our approach provides direct access to the density distribution of small samples of molecules, allowing us to obtain precise measurements of density-dependent collisional losses. Further, by mapping two internal states of the molecule to different atomic species, we demonstrate simultaneous detection of the position and rotational state of individual molecules. Finally, we implement local addressing of the sample using a focused beam to induce a spatially-dependent light shift on the rotational transitions of the molecules.

Title: On the extremal spectral properties of random graphs
Authors: C. T Martínez Martínez, J. A. Méndez Bermúdez
Abstract: In this work, we study some statistical properties of the extreme eigenstates of the randomly-weighted adjacency matrices of random graphs. We focus on two random graph models: Erdős-Rényi (ER) graphs and random geometric graphs (RGGs). Indeed, the adjacency matrices of both graph models are diluted versions of the Gaussian Orthogonal Ensemble (GOE) of random matrix theory (RMT), such that a transition from the Poisson Ensemble (PE) and the GOE is observed by increasing the graph average degree $\langle k \rangle$. First, we write down expressions for the spectral density in terms of $\langle k \rangle$ for the regimes below and above the percolation threshold. Then, we show that the distributions of both, the largest $\lambda_1$ and second-largest $\lambda_2$ eigenvalues approach the Tracy-Widom distribution of type 1 for $\langle k \rangle \gg 1$, while $\langle \lambda_1 \rangle = \sqrt{2\langle k \rangle}$. Additionally, we demonstrate that the distributions of the normalized distance between $\lambda_1$ and $\lambda_2$, the distribution of the ratio between higher consecutive eigenvalues spacings, as well as the distributions of the inverse participation ratios of the extreme eigenstates display a clear PE--to--GOE transition as a function of $\langle k \rangle$, so any of these distributions can be effectively used to probe the delocalization transition of the graph models without the need of the full spectrum.

Title: Extracting Composition-Dependent Diffusion Coefficients Over a Very Large Composition Range in NiCoFeCrMn High Entropy Alloy Following Strategic Design of Diffusion Couples and Physics Informed Neural Network Numerical Method
Authors: Suman Sadhu, Saswata Bhattacharyya, Aloke Paul
Abstract: Estimating composition dependent diffusion coefficients in multicomponent alloys was a longstanding challenge due to limitations in experimental methods. In this study, we have first demonstrated a strategic design of producing only three diffusion couples to estimate all types, that is tracer, intrinsic, and interdiffusion coefficients at the Kirkendall marker planes. This establishes a systematic variation of diffusion coefficients with composition in a very wide composition range of the NiCoFeCrMn system in comparison to the data available on impurity diffusion coefficients in pure elements and tracer diffusion coefficients at the equiatomic composition estimated by the radiotracer method. Following, a physics-informed Neural Network based numerical inverse method is developed to extract composition-dependent diffusivities over the whole composition range of the diffusion couples.

Title: Hydrogen response to high-density dislocations in bulk perovskite oxide SrTiO3
Authors: Xufei Fang, Lars Dörrer, Svetlana Korneychuk, Maria Vrellou, Alexander Welle, Stefan Wagner, Astrid Pundt, Harald Schmidt, Christoph Kirchlechner
Abstract: Hydrogen plays an increasingly important role in green energy technologies. For instance, proton-conducting oxides with high performance for fuel cell components or electrolysers need to be developed. However, this requires a fundamental understanding of hydrogen-defects interactions. While point defects and grain boundaries in oxides have been extensively studied, the role of dislocations as line defects remains less understood, primarily due to the challenge for effective dislocation engineering in brittle oxides. In this work, we demonstrate the impact of dislocations in bulk single-crystal perovskite oxide SrTiO3 on hydrogen uptake and diffusion using deuterium as tracer. Dislocations with a high density up to ~10 to the power of 14 per square meter were mechanically introduced at room temperature. Exposing this dislocation-rich and the reference regions (with a dislocation density of ~10 to the power of 10 per square meter) to deuterium at 400 °C for 1h, followed by secondary ion mass spectrometry measurements, we observed a ~100 times increase in deuterium incorporation in the dislocation-rich region. The result suggests that dislocations in oxides can act as an effective reservoir for deuterium. This proof-of-concept brings new insights into the emerging hydrogen-dislocation interactions in functional oxides.

Title: Bio-inspired learning algorithm for time series using Loewner equation
Authors: Yusuke Shibasaki
Abstract: Though the relationship between the theoretical statistical physics and machine learning techniques has been a well-discussed topic, the studies on the mechanism of learning inspired by the biological system are still developing. In this study, we investigate the application methods of Loewner equation to the learning algorithm particularly focusing on its statistical-mechanical aspects. We suggest two simple methods of learning of one-dimensional time series based on the unique encoding property of the discrete Loewner evolution. The first one is the Gaussian process (GP) regression using the normality of the distribution of Loewner driving force corresponding to the curve composed from the time series. The second one is the fluctuation-dissipation relation (FDR) for the time series, which is derived from the Loewner theory, measuring the sensitivity of the nonlinear dynamics under the small perturbation. These methods were numerically tested dealing with the neuronal dynamics generated by the leaky integrate-and-fire model. In addition, we discuss the similarity between the mapping mechanism of the present method and the structure of biological information processing from a point of view of self-organization system theory.

Title: Impact of in-plane disorders on the thermal conductivity of AgCrSe$_2$
Authors: Shota Izumi, Yui Ishii, Jinfeng Zhu, Tsunemasa Sakamoto, Shintaro Kobayashi, Shogo Kawaguchi, Jie Ma, Shigeo Mori
Abstract: Superionic conductors have recently attracted renewed attention for their use as thermoelectric materials due to their extremely low lattice thermal conductivity. Of central interest is why the superionic conductors exhibit such low thermal conductivity, and competing mechanisms have been proposed thus far. In this study, we investigate the effects of Cu and Au substitution for Ag site on the crystal structure and thermal properties of AgCrSe$_2$, which exhibits superionic conduction of Ag ions. We show that Au substitution significantly reduces the lattice thermal conductivity of AgCrSe$_2$. Powder structure analysis using synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that Au substitution increases the anisotropic atomic displacement parameter of Ag ions along the $a$ and $b$ axes. This result indicates that the amplitude of in-plane vibrations is enhanced, which is attributed to increased anharmonicity in the potential energy around Ag ions. The enhanced vibrational amplitude also suggests a reduction in the force constants between Ag ions. Consequently, the enhanced anharmonicity not only shortens the phonon lifetime ($\tau$) by increasing phonon-phonon scattering, but also increases the number of low-energy phonons, which further contributes to the reduction of $\tau$. This anharmonicity mechanism is applicable to other superionic conductors exhibiting ultra-low thermal conductivity, promoting their widespread use as thermoelectric materials.

Title: Distinguishing features of longitudinal magnetoconductivity for a Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: The band-degeneracy points in the Brillouin zones of chiral crystals exist in multiple avatars, with the high-symmetry points being able to host multifold nodes of distinct characters. A class of such crystals, assisted by the spin-orbit coupling, harbours fourfold degeneracy in the form of Rarita-Schwinger-Weyl node (RSWN) at the $\Gamma$-point. Our aim is to explore the nature of longitudinal magnetoconductivity, arising from applying collinear electric and magnetic fields, for such systems. Adjusting the chemical potential to lie near the intrinsic energy-location of the RSWN, the multifold nature of the RSWN is revealed by an interplay of intraband and interband scatterings, which would not arise in twofold degeneracies like the conventional Weyl nodes. The current study fills up the much-needed gap in obtaining the linear response from an exact computation, rather than the insufficient relaxation-time approximation employed earlier.

Title: Uniaxial stress tuning of interfacial thermal conductance in cubic BAs/4H-SiC heterostructures
Authors: Lei Zhang, Fei Tian, Ke Chen, Zhongbo Yan, Kun Cao
Abstract: Understanding interfacial thermal transport is essential for improving thermal management in high-speed power electronic devices, where the efficient removal of excess heat is a critical challenge. In this study, a machine learning interatomic potential with near first-principles accuracy was employed to investigate the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) between [111]-oriented cubic boron arsenide (cBAs) and [0001]-oriented 4H silicon carbide (4H-SiC), as well as its dependence on uniaxial stress. Among all possible bonding configurations at the cBAs(111)/4H-SiC(0001) interface, the B-C bonded interface was identified as the most energetically favorable. Non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations revealed that, under ambient conditions (300 K and 0 GPa), the ITC of the B-C interface reaches 353 $\pm$ 6 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$, and increases monotonically to 460 $\pm$ 3 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ under a uniaxial stress of 25 GPa perpendicular to the interface. For comparison, the As-C bonded interface exhibits a lower ITC, increasing from 233 $\pm$ 7 to 318 $\pm$ 6 MW m$^{-2}$ K$^{-1}$ over the same stress range. These results demonstrate that proper interfacial bonding and moderate uniaxial stress can significantly enhance thermal transport across the cBAs(111)/4H-SiC(0001) heterointerface, offering valuable insight for thermal design in next-generation power electronics.

Title: Néel vector controlled exceptional contours in $p$-wave magnet-ferromagnet junctions
Authors: Md Afsar Reja, Awadhesh Narayan
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems can host exceptional degeneracies where not only the eigenvalues, but also the corresponding eigenvectors coalesce. Recently, $p$-wave magnets have been introduced, which are characterized by their unusual odd parity. In this work, we propose the emergence of non-Hermitian degeneracies at the interface of $p$-wave magnets and ferromagnets. We demonstrate that this setup offers a remarkable tunability allowing realization of exceptional lines and rings, which can be controlled via the orientation of the $p$-wave Néel vector. We present the origin of these exceptional contours based on symmetry, and characterize them using phase rigidity. Our works puts forward a versatile platform to realize controllable non-Hermitian degeneracies at odd parity magnetic interfaces.

Title: Unconventional superconductivity in a non-centrosymmetric $α$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$
Authors: R. K. Kushwaha, Arushi, S. Jangid, P. K. Meena, R. Stewart, A. D. Hillier, R. P. Singh
Abstract: Non-centrosymmetric superconductors have emerged as a fascinating avenue for exploring unconventional superconductivity. Their broken inversion and time-reversal symmetries make them prime candidates for realizing the intrinsic superconducting diode effect (SDE). In this work, we synthesize the ternary non-centrosymmetric $\alpha$-Mn alloy NbTaOs$_{2}$ and conduct a comprehensive investigation of its superconducting properties through resistivity, magnetization, specific heat and muon spin rotation/relaxation ($\mu$SR) techniques. Our transverse field-$\mu$SR and specific heat results provide evidence of a moderately coupled, fully-gaped superconducting state. Zero field-$\mu$SR measurements reveal a subtle increase in the relaxation rate below the transition temperature, suggesting time reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting ground state of NbTaOs$_{2}$.

Title: Tunable corner states in topological insulators with long-range hoppings and diverse shapes
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: In this work, we develop a theoretical framework for the control of corner modes in higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) featuring long-range hoppings and diverse geometries, enabling precise tunability of their spatial positions. First, we demonstrate that the locations of corner states can be finely tuned by varying long-range hoppings in a circular HOTI, as revealed by a detailed edge theory analysis and the condition of vanishing Dirac mass. Moreover, we show that long-range hoppings along different directions (e.g., $x$ and $y$) have distinct effects on the positioning of corner states. Second, we investigate HOTIs with various polygonal geometries and find that the presence and location of corner modes depend sensitively on the shape. In particular, a corner hosts a localized mode if the Dirac masses of its two adjacent edges have opposite signs, while no corner mode emerges if the masses share the same sign. Our findings offer a versatile approach for the controlled manipulation of corner modes in HOTIs, opening new avenues for the design and implementation of higher-order topological materials.

Title: Defect-Mediated Pairing and Dissociation of Strongly Correlated Electrons in Low Dimensional Lattices: The Quantum Taxi Effect
Authors: Vincent Pouthier, Saad Yalouz
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics of a strongly correlated electron pair in a one-dimensional lattice, focusing on the occurrence of local dissociation/pairing mechanisms induced by a site energy defect. To this end, we simulate the time evolution of two interacting electrons on a finite-size chain governed by an extended Hubbard Hamiltonian including on-site Coulomb repulsion $ U $ and nearest-neighbor interaction $V$, along with single-electron hopping $J$. By introducing a local site energy defect with amplitude $ \Delta $, we show that a transition between spatially paired/dissociated electrons can occur in the vicinity of this site. Such mechanisms arise in a strongly correlated regime with non-zero nearest neighbor Coulomb interactions and under the conditions $ (U \sim V \sim \Delta) \gg J$. To rationalize these phenomena, we reformulate the two-electron dynamics of the original Hubbard chain as an effective single-particle problem on a two-dimensional network. Within this framework, we show that the pairing/dissociation dynamics are driven by resonances between two distinct families of two-electron eigenstates: $(i)$ states with two spatially well-separated electrons with one located at the site defect, and $(ii)$ states with locally bound electron located away from the defect. At resonance, these states hybridize, allowing transitions from locally paired to dissociated electrons (and vice versa) in the vicinity of the defect. These results provide new insights into exotic pairing phenomena in strongly correlated electronic systems and may have implications for the design of tunable many-body states in low-dimensional quantum materials.

Title: Information fusion strategy integrating pre-trained language model and contrastive learning for materials knowledge mining
Authors: Yongqian Peng, Zhouran Zhang, Longhui Zhang, Fengyuan Zhao, Yahao Li, Yicong Ye, Shuxin Bai
Abstract: Machine learning has revolutionized materials design, yet predicting complex properties like alloy ductility remains challenging due to the influence of processing conditions and microstructural features that resist quantification through traditional reductionist approaches. Here, we present an innovative information fusion architecture that integrates domain-specific texts from materials science literature with quantitative physical descriptors to overcome these limitations. Our framework employs MatSciBERT for advanced textual comprehension and incorporates contrastive learning to automatically extract implicit knowledge regarding processing parameters and microstructural characteristics. Through rigorous ablation studies and comparative experiments, the model demonstrates superior performance, achieving coefficient of determination (R2) values of 0.849 and 0.680 on titanium alloy validation set and refractory multi-principal-element alloy test set. This systematic approach provides a holistic framework for property prediction in complex material systems where quantitative descriptors are incomplete and establishes a foundation for knowledge-guided materials design and informatics-driven materials discovery.

Title: Half-integer thermal conductance in the absence of Majorana mode
Authors: Ujjal Roy, Sourav Manna, Souvik Chakraborty, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Ankur Das, Moshe Goldstein, Yuval Gefen, Anindya Das
Abstract: Considering a range of candidate quantum phases of matter, half-integer thermal conductance ($\kappa_{\text{th}}$) is believed to be an unambiguous evidence of non-Abelian states. It has been long known that such half-integer values arise due to the presence of Majorana edge modes, representing a significant step towards topological quantum computing platforms. Here we break this long-standing paradigm, reporting a comprehensive theoretical and experimental study where half-integer two-terminal thermal conductance plateau is realized employing Abelian phases. Our proposed setup features a confined geometry of bilayer graphene, interfacing distinct particle-like and hole-like integer quantum Hall states. Each segment of the device exhibits full charge and thermal equilibration. Our approach is amenable to generalization to other quantum Hall platforms, and may give rise to other values of fractional (electrical and thermal) quantized transport. Our study demonstrates that the observation of robust non-integer values of thermal conductance can arise as a manifestation of mundane equilibration dynamics as opposed to underlying non-trivial topology.

Title: Exact Renormalization Relation and Binding Energies for Three Identical Bosons

Abstract: In the low-energy limit, non-relativistic particles with short-range interactions exhibit universal behavior that is largely independent of microscopic details. This universality is typically described by effective field theory, in which the two-body interaction is renormalized to a single parameter-the scattering length. For systems of identical bosons, the three-body problem reveals the Efimov effect, a novel phenomenon proposed that necessitates the introduction of an additional three-body parameter. However, the exact relation between this three-body parameter, the coupling constants in the effective field theory, and the binding energies of Efimov states remains unresolved. In this Letter, we address this question through a comprehensive analysis of the Skorniakov-Ter-Martirosian equation with a finite cutoff. We establish an exact renormalization relation for the three-body parameter and determine its connection to the energies of Efimov bound states. These results are validated through high-precision numerical simulations. We expect our findings to be of fundamental interest across various fields, including atomic, nuclear, condensed matter, and particle physics, and to have broad applications in both few-body and many-body physics.

Title: Exciton condensation of composite fermions in double layer quantum Hall systems
Authors: Xiang-Jian Hou, Lei Wang, Ying-Hai Wu
Abstract: We study fractional quantum Hall states in double layer systems that can be interpreted as exciton condensates of composite fermions. An electron in one layer is dressed by two fluxes from the same layer and two fluxes from the other layer to become composite fermions that form effective Landau levels. It is found that two types of composite fermion exciton condensates could occur. In the first type ones, all effective levels are partially occupied and excitonic correlations are present between composite fermions in the same effective level. In the second type ones, composite fermions in the topmost effective levels of the two layers form exciton condensate whereas those in lower effective levels are independent. The electric transport signatures of these states are analyzed. We demonstrate using numerical calculations that some composite fermion exciton condensates can be realized in microscopic models that are relevant for graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides. For a fixed total filling factor, an exciton condensate may only be realized when the electron densities in the two layers belong to a certain range. It is possible that two types of states appear at the same total filling factor in different ranges. These results shed light on recent experimental observations and also suggest some promising future directions.

Title: Tailored ordering enables high-capacity cathode materials
Authors: Tzu-chen Liu, Adolfo Salgado-Casanova, So Yubuchi, Bianca Baldassarri, Muratahan Aykol, Jun Yoshida, Hisatsugu Yamasaki, Yizhou Zhu, Steven B. Torrisi, Christopher Wolverton
Abstract: Newly designed Li-ion battery cathode materials with high capacity and greater flexibility in chemical composition will be critical for the growing electric vehicles market. Cathode structures with cation disorder were once considered suboptimal, but recent demonstrations have highlighted their potential in Li$_{1+x}$M$_{1-x}$O$_{2}$ chemistries with a wide range of metal combinations M. By relaxing the strict requirements of maintaining ordered Li diffusion pathways, countless multi-metal compositions in LiMO$_2$ may become viable, aiding the quest for high-capacity cobalt-free cathodes. A challenge presented by this freedom in composition space is designing compositions which possess specific, tailored types of both long- and short-range orderings, which can ensure both phase stability and Li diffusion. However, the combinatorial complexity associated with local cation environments impedes the development of general design guidelines for favorable orderings. Here we propose ordering design frameworks from computational ordering descriptors, which in tandem with low-cost heuristics and elemental statistics can be used to simultaneously achieve compositions that possess favorable phase stability as well as configurations amenable to Li diffusion. Utilizing this computational framework, validated through multiple successful synthesis and characterization experiments, we not only demonstrate the design of LiCr$_{0.75}$Fe$_{0.25}$O$_2$, showcasing initial charge capacity of 234 mAhg$^{-1}$ and 320 mAhg$^{-1}$ in its 20% Li-excess variant Li$_{1.2}$Cr$_{0.6}$Fe$_{0.2}$O$_2$, but also present the elemental ordering statistics for 32 elements, informed by one of the most extensive first-principles studies of ordering tendencies known to us.

Title: Language Models Enable Data-Augmented Synthesis Planning for Inorganic Materials
Authors: Thorben Prein, Elton Pan, Janik Jehkul, Steffen Weinmann, Elsa A. Olivetti, Jennifer L. M. Rupp
Abstract: Inorganic synthesis planning currently relies primarily on heuristic approaches or machine-learning models trained on limited datasets, which constrains its generality. We demonstrate that language models, without task-specific fine-tuning, can recall synthesis conditions. Off-the-shelf models, such as GPT-4.1, Gemini 2.0 Flash and Llama 4 Maverick, achieve a Top-1 precursor-prediction accuracy of up to 53.8 % and a Top-5 performance of 66.1 % on a held-out set of 1,000 reactions. They also predict calcination and sintering temperatures with mean absolute errors below 126 °C, matching specialized regression methods. Ensembling these language models further enhances predictive accuracy and reduces inference cost per prediction by up to 70 %. We subsequently employ language models to generate 28,548 synthetic reaction recipes, which we combine with literature-mined examples to pretrain a transformer-based model, SyntMTE. After fine-tuning on the combined dataset, SyntMTE reduces mean-absolute error in sintering temperature prediction to 73 °C and in calcination temperature to 98 °C. This strategy improves models by up to 8.7 % compared with baselines trained exclusively on experimental data. Finally, in a case study on Li7La3Zr2O12 solid-state electrolytes, we demonstrate that SyntMTE reproduces the experimentally observed dopant-dependent sintering trends. Our hybrid workflow enables scalable, data-efficient inorganic synthesis planning.

Authors: Matteo Teodori, Dario Abbondanza, Mirko Gallo, Carlo Massimo Casciola
Abstract: This paper deals with the condensation of liquid droplets on hydrophobic and hydrophilic surfaces. A stochastic mesoscale model based on the theory of fluctuating hydrodynamics and the thermodynamics of a diffuse interface approach shows how direct simulation of the vapour-liquid transition from the nucleation process to droplet hydrodynamics can be achieved. Such simulations explain the role of wettability in filmwise and dropwise condensation regimes and the main limitations of classical nucleation theory.

Title: Inferring Grain Size Distributions from Magnetic Hysteresis in M-type Hexaferrites
Authors: Masoud Ataei, Mohammad Jafar Molaei, Abolghasem Ataie
Abstract: We develop a stochastic-dynamic framework to infer latent grain size distribution from magnetic hysteresis data in M-type hexaferrite materials, offering an alternative to imaging-based characterization. A stochastic nucleation-growth process yields a Modified Lognormal Power-law grain size distribution. This is combined with Brown's relation to obtain a coercivity probability distribution, which is embedded within a dynamic magnetization model. A key feature is the joint estimation of microstructural parameters, including the critical grain radius, through inverse optimization of full hysteresis loops. Experimental validation on hydrothermally synthesized strontium hexaferrite subjected to nitrogen treatment and recalcination reveals interpretable trajectories of nucleation, growth, and structural memory encoded in the magnetic response.

Title: First-Passage Observables of $d$-dimensional Confined Jump Processes
Authors: Jérémie Klinger, Olivier Bénichou, Raphaël Voituriez
Abstract: First-passage observables (FPO) are central to understanding stochastic processes in confined domains, with applications spanning chemical reaction kinetics, foraging behavior, and molecular transport. While extensive analytical results exist for continuous processes, discrete jump processes -- crucial for describing empirically observed dynamics -- remain largely unexplored in this context. This paper presents a comprehensive framework to systematically evaluate FPO for $d$-dimensional confined isotropic jump processes, capturing both geometric and dynamical observables. Leveraging the connection between jump processes and their continuous counterparts, we address the limitations of continuous approximations in capturing discrete effects, particularly near absorbing boundaries. Our method unifies FPO calculations across edge and bulk regimes, providing explicit asymptotic expressions for key observables, such as splitting probabilities, harmonic measures, and first-passage time distributions in complex geometries. We illustrate our approach with paradigmatic examples, including eccentric splitting probabilities in two-dimensional disks and mean exit times for heavy-tailed processes. These results underscore the broad applicability of our framework to diverse physical systems, offering novel insights into the interplay between discrete dynamics and confining geometries.

Title: Machine learning potentials for modeling alloys across compositions
Authors: Killian Sheriff, Daniel Xiao, Yifan Cao, Lewis R. Owen, Rodrigo Freitas
Abstract: Materials properties depend strongly on chemical composition, i.e., the relative amounts of each chemical element. Changes in composition lead to entirely different chemical arrangements, which vary in complexity from perfectly ordered (i.e., stoichiometric compounds) to completely disordered (i.e., solid solutions). Accurately capturing this range of chemical arrangements remains a major challenge, limiting the predictive accuracy of machine learning potentials (MLPs) in materials modeling. Here, we combine information theory and machine learning to optimize the sampling of chemical motifs and design MLPs that effectively capture the behavior of metallic alloys across their entire compositional and structural landscape. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by predicting the compositional dependence of various material properties - including stacking-fault energies, short-range order, heat capacities, and phase diagrams - for the AuPt and CuAu binary alloys, the ternary CrCoNi, and the TiTaVW high-entropy alloy. Extensive comparison against experimental data demonstrates the robustness of this approach in enabling materials modeling with high physical fidelity.

Title: Statistical Description of Fermi System over a Surface in a Uniform External Field
Authors: Yu.M. Poluektov, A.A. Soroka
Abstract: A statistical approach to the description of the thermodynamic properties of the Fermi particle system occupying a half-space over a plane of finite size in a uniform external field is proposed. The number of particles per unit area is assumed to be arbitrary, in particular, small. General formulas are obtained for entropy, energy, thermodynamic potential, heat capacities under various conditions and the distribution of the particle number density over the surface. In the continuum limit of a large surface area, the temperature dependences of heat capacities and density distribution are calculated. The cases of gravitational and electric fields are considered.

Title: Finding Some Impossibility of Flat-Folding of Given Origami Crease Pattern by Graphical Representation
Authors: Chihiro Nakajima
Abstract: Flat-foldability problem of origami is the problem to determine whether a given crease pattern drawn on a piece of paper is possible to fold without any penetration or intrusion of a polygon into any connections among them. It is known from the results of Bern and Hayes and following studies that determining whether an origami diagram which constitute of polygons in general shapes can be flat-folded is an NP-hard problem. In this manuscript, on determining the flat foldability of unsigned crease patterns that satisfy the necessary conditions imposed by the Kawasaki-Justin theorem for all interior vertices, we introduce a graph representation based on an arrangement of polygons whose contours are consist of creases, allowing overlapping of the polygons. On the graphical representation, a method is proposed to efficiently detect the conditions for flat-folding inability by using the properties of the cycle basis. We also demonstrate the above method using an example of a fold that is already known to be impossible to flat-fold.

Title: Collective Interference Phonon Spin Manifested in Infrared Circular Dichroism
Authors: Yizhou Liu, Yu-Tao Tan, Dapeng Liu, Jie Ren
Abstract: The classical field description of ``phonon spin" relies on the invariance of a continuous elastic field under infinitesimal rotation. However, a local ``medium element" in the continuous field may contain large numbers of vibrational particles at microscopic level, like for complex lattices with many atoms in a unit cell. We find this causes the phonon spin in real materials no longer a simple sum of each atom rotation, but a collective interference of many particles, since phonons are phase-coherent vibrational modes across unit cells. We demonstrate the many-particle-interference phonon spin manifested as the dipole moment rotating (DMR) of charge-polarized unit cell, by deriving the infrared circular dichroism (ICD) with phonon-photon interaction in complex lattices. We compare the DMR with the local atom rotation without interference, and exemplify their distinct ICD spectrum in a chiral lattice model and two realistic chiral materials. Detectable ICD measurements are proposed in $\alpha$-quartz with Weyl phonon at Gamma point. Our study underlies the important role of many-particle-interference and uncovers a deeper insight of phonon spin in real materials with complex lattices.

Title: Interface-controlled antiferromagnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Liu Yang, Yuan-Yuan Jiang, Xiao-Yan Guo, Shu-Hui Zhang, Rui-Chun Xiao, Wen-Jian Lu, Lan Wang, Yu-Ping Sun, Evgeny Y. Tsymbal, Ding-Fu Shao
Abstract: Magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) are the key building blocks of high-performance spintronic devices. While conventional MTJs rely on ferromagnetic (FM) materials, employing antiferromagnetic (AFM) compounds can significantly increase operation speed and packing density. Current prototypes of AFM tunnel junctions (AFMTJs) exploit antiferromagnets either as spin-filter insulating barriers or as metal electrodes supporting bulk spin-dependent currents. Here, we highlight a largely overlooked AFMTJ prototype, where bulk-spin-degenerate electrodes with an A-type AFM stacking form magnetically uncompensated interfaces, enabling spin-polarized tunneling currents and a sizable tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. Using first-principles quantum-transport calculations and the van der Waals (vdW) metal Fe$_{4}$GeTe$_{2}$ as a representative A-type AFM electrode, we demonstrate a large negative TMR arising solely from the alignment of interfacial magnetic moments. This prototype of AFMTJs can also be realized with various non-vdW A-type AFM metals that support roughness-insensitive surface magnetization. Beyond TMR, AFMTJs based on A-type antiferromagnets allow convenient switching of the Néel vector, opening a new paradigm for AFM spintronics that leverages spin-dependent properties at AFM interfaces.

Title: Superconductivity and inhomogeneous charge-ordered state in the two-Dimensional Hubbard model -- Off-Diagonal Wave Function Monte Carlo Studies of Hubbard Model IV
Authors: Takashi Yanagisawa
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of the two-dimensional Hubbard model, based on the off-diagonal wave function variational Monte Carlo method. We use an optimized wave function that is improved from an initial one-body wave function by multiplying by multiple correlation operators that are given by the form of exp($-S$)-type where $S$ is a suitable operator. We examine the inhomogeneous ground state at near 1/8 doping in the strongly correlated region where the on-site Coulomb interaction is larger than the bandwidth. The $d$-wave superconductivity with a spatially oscillating gap function can coexist with the charge ordering in the ground state without magnetic ordering, and superconducting condensation energy increases by this coexistence. We also show the $d$-wave pair correlation function as a function of lattice sites. The correlation function indicates that the long-range superconducting order indeed exists, and also that the strong electron correlation suppresses the pair correlation function.

Title: Optimizing optical properties of bilayer PtSe$_2$: the role of twist angle and hydrostatic pressure
Authors: Paulina Jureczko, Zbigniew Dendzik, Marcin Kurpas
Abstract: Two-dimensional van der Waals materials offer exceptional tunability in their electronic properties. In this paper, we explore how twisting and hydrostatic pressure can be leveraged to engineer the electronic and optical characteristics of bilayer PtSe$_2$. Using state-of-the-art first-principles density functional methods, we calculate the electronic band structure and the imaginary part of the dielectric function across multiple twist angles and pressure values. We find, that at the twist angle $\theta=13.17^\circ$, bilayer PtSe$_2$, which is intrinsically an indirect semiconductor, transforms into a direct-gap semiconductor. Moreover, we demonstrate that hydrostatic out-of-plane pressure boosts near-infrared optical activity, further expanding the functional potential of PtSe$_2$ bilayers. The demonstrated high tunability of electronic and optical properties by twisting and pressure opens new application directions of PtSe$_2$ in optoelectronics.

Title: Layer Pseudospin Superconductivity in Twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Jin-Xin Hu, Akito Daido, Zi-Ting Sun, Ying-Ming Xie, K. T. Law
Abstract: Recent experiments have observed signatures of spin-valley-polarized unconventional superconductivity in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$). Here, we explore the rich physics of superconducting tMoTe$_2$, enabled by its unique layer-pseudospin structure. Within a minimal two-orbital layer-pseudospin model framework, both interlayer and intralayer Cooper pairings can be effectively visualized using a layer-space Bloch sphere representation. Remarkably, we find that interlayer pairing prevails in the spin-valley-polarized state, whereas intralayer pairing dominates in the spin-valley-unpolarized state. Strikingly, we further predict that for spin-valley-polarized intravalley superconducting state, experimentally feasible weak displacement fields can stabilize finite-momentum pairings at low temperatures. Additionally, in-plane magnetic fields, which break three-fold rotational symmetry, induce field-direction-dependent finite-momentum pairing states, leading to a versatile momentum-selection phase diagram. Our work highlights the crucial role of layer pseudospin in tMoTe$_2$'s unconventional superconductivity and demonstrates its unique tunability via external fields.

Title: Structure-Dynamics Correlation and Its Link to Fragility and Dynamic Heterogeneity
Authors: Mohit Sharma, Srikanth Sastry, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: Understanding the connection between structure, dynamics, and fragility (the rate at which relaxation times grow with decreasing temperature) is central to unraveling the glass transition. Fragility is often linked to dynamic heterogeneity, and thus it is commonly assumed that if structure influences dynamics, more fragile systems should exhibit stronger structure--dynamics correlations. In this study, we test the generality of this assumption using three model systems: Lennard-Jones (LJ) and Weeks--Chandler--Andersen, where fragility is tuned via density, and a modified LJ (q, p) system, where potential softness is changed to vary fragility. We employ a structural order parameter derived from the mean--field caging potential and analyze energy barriers at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. While the macroscopic slope of the energy barrier, suitably defined, correlates with fragility, no consistent correlation is found for the microscopic energy barriers. Instead, the latter shows a strong correlation with an independently computed structure--dynamics measure obtained from isoconfigurational ensemble. Surprisingly, the two systems with the highest structure--dynamics correlation, LJ at rho = 1.1 and the (8, 5) model, are respectively the least and most fragile within their classes. These systems exhibit broad mobility distributions, bimodal displacement profiles, and high non-Gaussian parameters, all indicative of dynamic heterogeneity. However, their dynamic susceptibilities remain low, suggesting a decoupling between spatial correlation and temporal heterogeneity. Both systems lie in the enthalpy-dominated regime and are near the spinodal, suggesting mechanical instability as a source of heterogeneity. These findings challenge the conventional linkage among fragility, heterogeneity, and structure--dynamics correlation.

Title: Electric Field Control of Spin Orbit Coupling and Circular Photogalvanic Effect in a True Ferrielectric Crystal
Authors: Yunlin Lei, Xinyu Yang, Shouyu Wang, Daliang Zhang, Zitao Wang, Jiayou Zhang, Yihao Yang, Chuanshou Wang, Tianqi Xiao, Yinxin Bai, Junjiang Tian, Congcong Chen, Yu Han, Shuai Dong, Junling Wang
Abstract: Materials possessing long range ordering of magnetic spins or electric dipoles have been the focus of condensed matter research. Among them, ferri-systems with two sublattices of unequal/noncollinear spins or electric dipoles are expected to combine the properties of ferro- and antiferro-systems, but lack experimental observations in single phase materials. This is particularly true for the ferrielectric system, since the electric dipoles usually can be redefined to incorporate the two sublattices into one, making it indistinguishable from ferroelectric. This raises doubts about whether or not ferrielectricity can be considered as an independent ferroic order. Here we report the observation of true ferrielectric behaviors in a hybrid single crystal (MV)[SbBr5] (MV2+ = N,N'-dimethyl-4,4'-bipyridinium or methylviologen), where the two electric dipole sublattices switch asynchronously, thus cannot be reduced to ferroelectric by redefining the unit cell. Furthermore, the complex dipole configuration imparts circularly polarized light sensitivity to the system. An electric field can modulate the non-collinear dipole sublattices and even induce a transition from ferrielectric to ferroelectric state, thereby tuning the helicity-dependent photocurrent. This study opens a new paradigm for the study of true irreducible ferrielectricity (a new class of polar system) and provides an effective approach to the electric field control of spin-orbit coupling and circular photogalvanic effect.

Title: Large Scale Manufacture of Phase Pure Two-Dimensional Metallic MoS2 Nanosheets
Authors: Ziwei Jeffrey Yang, Zhuangnan Li, James Moloney, Leyi Loh, John Walmsley, Jiahang Li, Lixin Liu, Han Zang, Han Yan, Soumya Sarkar, Yan Wang, Manish Chhowalla
Abstract: Metallic monolayered [or two - dimensional (2D)] MoS2 nanosheets show tremendous promise for energy storage and catalysis applications. However, state-of-the-art chemical exfoliation methods require > 48 hours to produce milligrams of metallic 2D MoS2. Further, chemically exfoliated MoS2 nanosheets are a mixture of metallic (1T or 1T prime 50% to 70%) and semiconducting (2H 30% to 50%) phases. Here, we demonstrate large-scale and rapid (>600 grams per hour) production of purely metallic phase 2D MoS2 (and WS2, MoSe2) nanosheets using microwave irradiation. Atomic resolution imaging shows 1T or 1T prime metallic phase in basal plane - consistent with close to 100% metallic phase concentration measured by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The high 1T phase concentration results in the highest exchange current density of 0.175 plus-minus 0.03 mA cm-2 and among the lowest Tafel slopes (39 - 43 mV dec-1) measured to date for the hydrogen evolution reaction. In supercapacitors and lithium-sulfur pouch cell batteries, record-high volumetric capacitance of 753 plus-minus 3.6 F cm-3 and specific capacity of 1245 plus-minus 16 mAh g-1 (at exceptionally low electrolyte to sulfur ratio = 2 microlitre g-1), respectively, are obtained. Our method provides a practical pathway for producing high quality purely metallic phase 2D materials for high performance energy devices.

Title: DFT-based insight into finite-temperature properties of ferroelectric perovskites with lone-pair: the case of CsGeX$_3$ (X=Cl, Br, I)
Authors: Ravi Kashikar, S. Lisenkov, I. Ponomareva
Abstract: Ferroelectrics remain in the focus of scientific attention for decades owing to their fundamental and practical appeal. Recently, ferroelectricity has been demonstrated in semiconducting halide perovskites, offering both a rare combination of ferroelectricity and semiconductivity in the same material and a possible alternative to the prevailing perovskite oxide ferroelectrics. We propose a route to simulating such materials at finite temperatures capable of reproducing key experimental and first-principle data, such as Curie temperature, phase transition sequence, spontaneous polarization, and soft mode frequencies. The key methodological finding is the superior performance of hybrid exchange correlation functionals in parametrization of effective Hamiltonians for ferroelectrics with lone pair. The parametrization for effective Hamiltonians for CsGeX$_3$, (X=Cl, Br, I) is reported. The application of methodology to study polarization reversal in CsGeX$_3$, allows for the development of a ``minimalistic" model for polarization reversal in ferroelectrics that provides an insight into the mechanisms of polarization reversal and its key features, such as the relationship between the coercive field, temperature, and AC field frequency. Importantly, the model reveals the origin of the well-known and ever-puzzling overestimation of coercive fields in computations. Furthermore, we report a variety of finite-temperature properties of CsGeX$_3$, ferroelectrics, such as dielectric susceptibility, pyroelectric coefficients, and energy storage density, which reveal that these halide perovskites possess properties comparable to their oxide counterparts. We believe that our work provides significant methodological advancements, deepens fundamental understanding of ferroelectrics, and reveals the potential of halide perovskite ferroelectrics.

Title: Symplectic Spin-Lattice Dynamics with Machine-Learning Potentials
Authors: Zhengtao Huang, Ben Xu
Abstract: Accurate atomic-scale simulations of magnetic materials require precise handling of coupled spin-lattice degrees of freedom. Traditional spin-lattice dynamics (SLD), employing Newtonian equation for lattice evolution and the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation for spins, encounters severe limitations with machine-learning potentials, including poor energy conservation and excessive computational costs due to non-symplectic integration. In this work, we propose TSPIN, a unified Nosé-Hoover Chain-based method overcoming these issues. By extending the classical Lagrangian with explicit spin kinetic terms and thermostat variables, we derive symplectic Hamiltonian formulations suitable for NVE, NVT, and NPT ensembles. The method integrates spin and lattice dynamics simultaneously, ensuring robust energy conservation and significantly reducing computational cost. Benchmarks against analytical harmonic spin-lattice models confirm its accuracy, and application to FCC iron using a DeepSPIN MLP demonstrates superior numerical stability and near-linear computational scaling compared to the conventional LLG method. Thus, TSPIN provides a powerful, broadly applicable framework for efficiently simulating complex spin-lattice phenomena and multi-degree-of-freedom systems at large scales.

Title: Information dynamics, natural computing and Maxwell's demon in two skyrmions system
Authors: Yoshishige Suzuki, Hiroki Mori, Soma Miki, Kota Emoto, Ryo Ishikawa, Eiiti Tamura, Hikaru Nomura, Minori Goto
Abstract: The probabilistic information flow and natural computational capability of a system with two magnetic skyrmions at room temperature have been experimentally evaluated. Based on this evaluation, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon operating at room temperature is also proposed. Probabilistic behavior has gained attention for its potential to enable unconventional computing paradigms. However, information propagation and computation in such systems are more complex than in conventional computers, making their visualization essential. In this study, a two-skyrmion system confined within a square potential well at thermal equilibrium was analyzed using information thermodynamics. Transfer entropy and the time derivative of mutual information were employed to investigate the information propagation speed, the absence of a Maxwell's demon in thermal equilibrium, and the system's non-Markovian properties. Furthermore, it was demonstrated that the system exhibits a small but finite computational capability for the nonlinear XOR operation, potentially linked to hidden information in the non-Markovian system. Based on these experiments and analyses, an all-solid-state built-in Maxwell's demon utilizing the two-skyrmion system and operating at room temperature is proposed.

Title: Disorder by Design: Unveiling Local Structure and Functional Insights in High Entropy Oxides
Authors: John P. Barber, William J. Deary, Andrew N. Titus, Gerald R. Bejger, Saeed S.I. Almishal, Christina M. Rost
Abstract: High entropy oxides (HEOs) are a rapidly growing class of compositionally complex ceramics in which configurational disorder is engineered to unlock novel functionality. While average crystallographic symmetry is often retained, local structural and chemical disorder, including cation size and valence mismatch, oxygen sublattice distortions, and site-specific bonding, strongly governs ionic transport, redox behavior, magnetic ordering, and dielectric response. This review outlines how these modes of disorder manifest across key oxide families such as rock salt, spinel, fluorite, and perovskite. We highlight recent advances in spectroscopy, total scattering, and high-resolution microscopy enable multi-scale insight into short- and intermediate-range order. By integrating experimental observations with theoretical modeling of entropy and local energetics, we establish a framework linking structural heterogeneity to emergent properties. These insights not only deepen our fundamental understanding of disorder-property relationships but also offer a path toward rational design of tunable materials for catalysis, energy storage, electronics, and much more.

Title: Assessing Vibrational Frequencies of CO Adsorbed on Cerium Oxide Surfaces Using SCAN and r2SCAN Functionals
Authors: Alexander Contreras-Payares, Pablo G. Lustemberg, M. Verónica Ganduglia-Pirovano
Abstract: The vibrational frequency of carbon monoxide (CO) adsorbed on ceria-based catalysts serves as a sensitive probe for identifying exposed surface facets, provided that experimental reference data on well-defined single-crystal surfaces and reliable theoretical assignments are available. Previous studies have shown that the hybrid DFT approach using the HSE06 functional yields good agreement with experimental observations, whereas the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) with PBE+U does not. In this work, we assess the performance of different exchange-correlation functionals by comparing the meta-GGA functionals SCAN and r2SCAN meta-GGA functionals with HSE06 in predicting CO vibrational frequencies on cerium oxide surfaces. The meta-GGA functionals offer no significant improvement for oxidized CeO2(111) and CeO2(110) surfaces and fail to localize excess charge on the reduced surfaces. Adding a Hubbard U term improves charge localization, but the predicted vibrational frequencies still fall short of HSE06 accuracy. These limitations are attributed to the meta-GGA's inability to adequately capture facet- and configuration-specific donation and back-donation effects, which influence the C-O bond length and CO force constant upon adsorption. Despite the higher computational cost when used with plane-wave basis sets, hybrid DFT remains essential for accurate interpretation of experimental results.

Title: Optimisation of Activator Solutions for Geopolymer Synthesis: Thermochemical Stability, Sequencing, and Standardisation
Authors: Ramon Skane, Franca Jones, Arie van Riessen, Evan Jamieson, Xiao Sun, William D.A. Rickard
Abstract: Geopolymers present a sustainable alternative to conventional binders, however, their commercial viability is hindered by a lack of standardised methods for preparing stabile activator solutions; alkaline feedstocks critical to geopolymer synthesis. This study presents a combined experimental and modelling approach to evaluate the thermochemical stability, solubility constraints, and silica speciation behaviour of sodium silicate-based activators. Using quantitative 29Si NMR analysis, thermodynamic stability and three-dimensional solubility modelling, this research identifies optimal preparation conditions that minimise irreversible precipitation risks and optimises mixing periods. Key findings indicate that higher solution temperatures associated with optimised activator solution preparation were found to enhance thermochemical stability and reactivity, while cooling increased viscosity and the likelihood of unstable solution behaviour, which may necessitate discarding. The order in which feedstocks are combined directly affects whether the solution becomes unstable, with an optimal sequence of water, alkali-hydroxide, soluble silicate found to ensure greater process reliability. A predictive model and accompanying visual tools enable practitioners to assess solution viability and define stability windows by quantifying initial and final/unstable periods and temperatures based on feedstock composition and solution temperature. These results contribute to improved reproducibility and quality control in geopolymer research and represent a step toward developing standard operating procedures for activator solution synthesis.

Title: Fragmentation of a trapped multiple-species bosonic mixture
Authors: O. E. Alon, L. S. Cederbaum
Abstract: We consider a multiple-species mixture of interacting bosons, $N_1$ bosons of mass $m_1$, $N_2$ bosons of mass $m_2$, and $N_3$ bosons of mass $m_3$ in a harmonic trap of frequency $\omega$. The corresponding intraspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{11}$, $\lambda_{22}$, and $\lambda_{33}$, and the interspecies interaction strengths are $\lambda_{12}$, $\lambda_{13}$, and $\lambda_{23}$. When the shape of all interactions are harmonic, this is the generic multiple-species harmonic-interaction model which is exactly solvable. We start by solving the many-particle Hamiltonian and concisely discussing the ground-state wavefunction and energy in explicit forms as functions of all parameters, the masses, numbers of particles, and the intraspecies and interspecies interaction strengths. We then move to compute explicitly the reduced one-particle density matrices for all the species and diagonalize them, thus generalizing the treatment in [J. Chem. Phys. {\bf 161}, 184307 (2024)]. The respective eigenvalues determine the degree of fragmentation of each species. As applications, we focus on aspects that do not appear for the respective single-species and two-species systems. For instance, placing a mixture of two kinds of bosons in a bath made by a third kind, and controlling the fragmentation of the former by coupling to the latter. Another example exploits the possibility of different connectivities (i.e., which species interacts with which species) in the mixture, and demonstrates how the fragmentation of species $3$ can be manipulated by the interaction between species $1$ and species $2$, when species $3$ and $1$ do not interact with each other. We thereby highlight properties of fragmentation that only appear in the multiple-species mixture. Further applications are briefly discussed.

Title: Kinetic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems
Authors: Alexandra J. Hardy, Samuel Cameron, Steven McDonald, Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Elsen Tjhung
Abstract: We derive a self-consistent hydrodynamic theory of coupled binary-fluid-surfactant systems from the underlying microscopic physics using Rayleigh's variational principle. At the microscopic level, surfactant molecules are modelled as dumbbells that exert forces and torques on the fluid and interface while undergoing Brownian motion. We obtain the overdamped stochastic dynamics of these particles from a Rayleighian dissipation functional, which we then coarse-grain to derive a set of continuum equations governing the surfactant concentration, orientation, and the fluid density and velocity. This approach introduces a polarization field, representing the average orientation of surfactants, and yields a mesoscopic free energy functional from which all governing equations are consistently derived. The resulting model accurately captures key surfactant phenomena, including surface tension reduction and droplet stabilization, as confirmed by both perturbation theory and numerical simulations.

Title: Flocking as a second-order phase transition in self-aligning active crystals
Authors: Marco Musacchio, Alexander P. Antonov, Hartmut Löwen, Lorenzo Caprini
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional crystal composed of active units governed by self-alignment. This mechanism induces a torque that aligns a particle's orientation with its velocity and leads to a phase transition from a disordered to a flocking crystal. Here, we provide the first microscopic theory that analytically maps the crystal dynamics onto a Landau-Ginzburg model, in which the velocity-dependent effective free energy undergoes a transition from a single-well shape to a Mexican-hat profile. As confirmed by simulations, our theory quantitatively predicts the transition point and characteristic spatial velocity correlations. The continuous change of the order parameter and the diverging behavior of the analytically predicted correlation length imply that flocking in self-aligning active crystals is a second-order phase transition. These findings provide a theoretical foundation for the flocking phenomenon observed experimentally in active granular particles and migrating cells.

Title: Quasiparticle Properties of Long-Range Impurities in a Bose Condensate
Authors: T. Alper Yoğurt, Matthew T. Eiles
Abstract: An impurity immersed in a Bose condensate can form a quasiparticle known as a Bose polaron. When the impurity-boson interaction is short-ranged, the quasiparticle's properties are universal, characterized - independent of the bath density $n_0$ - by the impurity-boson scattering length $a_{IB}$. Long-ranged interactions - such as provided by Rydberg or ionic impurities - introduce an effective interaction range $r_{\mathrm{eff}}$, and boson-boson interactions provide a third length scale, the condensate coherence length $\xi $. These competing length scales raise the question of whether a universal description remains valid across different bath densities. In this study, we discuss the quasiparticle nature of long-range impurities and its dependence on the length scales $ n_0^{-1/3} $, $ r_{\mathrm{eff}} $, and $ \xi $. We employ two complementary theories - the coherent state Ansatz and the perturbative Gross-Pitaevskii theory - which incorporate beyond-Fröhlich interactions. We derive an analytical expression for the beyond-Fröhlich effective mass for a contact interaction and numerically compute the effective mass for long-range impurities. We argue that the coupling parameter $ |a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} $ remains the principal parameter governing the properties of the polaron. For weak $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \ll 1) $ and intermediate $ (|a_{IB}| n_0^{1/3} \simeq 1) $ values of the coupling parameter, long-range impurities in a BEC are well-described as quasiparticles with a finite quasiparticle weight and a well-defined effective mass. However, the quasiparticle weight becomes significantly suppressed as the effective impurity volume is occupied by an increasing number of bath particles $ (r_{\mathrm{eff}} n_0^{1/3} \gg 1) $.

Title: Monte Carlo simulations of crystal defects in open ensembles
Authors: Flynn Walsh, Babak Sadigh, Joseph T. McKeown, Timofey Frolov
Abstract: Open materials systems are often inaccessible to conventional atomistic simulations, which add and remove atoms by creating high-energy defects that may be sampled with vanishing probability. This longstanding challenge motivates a new Hamiltonian Monte Carlo method that maps the grand canonical problem to a canonical system involving non-interacting fictitious particles. To trial deletions or insertions, a real or fictitious particle is selected according to an energy-based biasing scheme and gradually transformed over a microcanonical molecular dynamics trajectory. The method is validated, optimized, and used to compute point defect free energies that allow for arbitrary structures and interactions among multiple defects. Several grain boundaries are then equilibrated in a physically representative open ensemble, demonstrating a new approach to studying interface structures and their phase transitions.

Title: The impact of parameter spread of high-temperature superconducting Josephson junctions on the performance of quantum-based voltage standards
Authors: Guanghong Wen, Yi Zhu, Yingxiang Zheng, Shuhe Cui, Ji Wang, Yanyun Ren, Hao Li, Guofeng Zhang, Lixing You
Abstract: Quantum metrology based on Josephson junction array reproduces the most accurate desired voltage by far, therefore being introduced to provide voltage standards worldwide. In this work, we quantitatively analyzed the dependence of the first Shapiro step height of the junction array at 50 GHz on the parameter spread of 10,000 Josephson junctions by numerical simulation with resistively shunted junction model. The results indicate an upper limit spread of the critical current and resistance of the Josephson junctions. Specifically, to keep the maximum first Shapiro step above 0.88 mA, the critical current standard deviation, $\sigma$, should not exceed 25%, and for it to stay above 0.6 mA, the resistance standard deviation should not exceed 1.5%.

Title: Topological phase transitions in strained Lieb-Kagome lattices
Authors: W. P. Lima, T. F. O. Lara, J. P. G. Nascimento, J. Milton Pereira Jr., D. R. da Costa
Abstract: Lieb and Kagome lattices exhibit two-dimensional topological insulator behavior with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological classification when considering spin-orbit coupling. In this study, we used a general tight-binding Hamiltonian with a morphological control parameter $\theta$ to describe the Lieb ($\theta=\pi/2$), Kagome ($\theta=2\pi/3$), and transition lattices ($\pi/2<\theta<2\pi/3$) while considering intrinsic spin-orbit (ISO) coupling. We systematically investigated the effects of shear and uniaxial strains, applied along different crystallographic directions, on the electronic spectrum of these structures. Our findings reveal that these deformations can induce topological phase transitions by modifying the structural lattice angle associated with the interconversibility process between Lieb and Kagome, the amplitude of the strain, and the magnitude of the ISO coupling. These transitions are confirmed by the evolution of Berry curvature and by changes in the Chern number when the gap closes. Additionally, by analyzing hypothetical strain scenarios in which the hopping and ISO coupling parameters remain intentionally unchanged, our results demonstrated that the strain-induced phase transitions arise from changes in the hopping and ISO coupling parameters.

Title: Implementing van der Waals forces for polytope particles in DEM simulations of clay
Authors: Dominik Krengel, Jian Chen, Zhipeng Yu, Hans-Georg Matuttis, Takashi Matsushima
Abstract: Clay minerals are non-spherical nano-scale particles that usually form flocculated, house-of-card like structures under the influence of inter-molecular forces. Numerical modeling of clays is still in its infancy as the required inter-particle forces are available only for spherical particles. A polytope approach would allow shape-accurate forces and torques while simultaneously being more performant. The Anandarajah solution provides an analytical formulation for van der Waals forces for cuboid particles but in its original form is not suitable for implementation in DEM simulations. In this work, we discuss the necessary changes for a functional implementation of the Anandarajah solution in a DEM simulation of rectangular particles and their extension to cuboid particles.

Title: Diagnosing 2D symmetry protected topological states via mixed state anomaly
Authors: Chao Xu, Yunlong Zang, Yixin Ma, Yingfei Gu, Shenghan Jiang
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases are short-range entangled quantum states characterized by anomalous edge behavior, a manifestation of the bulk-boundary correspondence for topological phases. Moreover, the Li-Haldane conjecture posits that the entanglement spectrum exhibits the same anomaly as the physical edge spectrum, thereby serving as an entanglement-based fingerprint for identifying topological phases. In this work, we extend the entanglement-based diagnostic tools by demonstrating that the edge anomaly is manifested not only in the entanglement spectrum but also in the reduced density matrix itself, a phenomenon we refer to as the mixed state anomaly. Focusing on the two-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ SPT phase, we show that this anomaly is subtly encoded in symmetry-twisted mixed states, leading to a topological contribution to the disorder parameter beyond the area law, as well as a spontaneous-symmetry-breaking type long-range order when time reversal symmetry is present.

Title: First-passage and extreme value statistics for overdamped Brownian motion in a linear potential
Authors: Feng Huang, Hanshuang Chen
Abstract: We investigate the first-passage properties and extreme-value statistics of an overdamped Brownian particle confined by an external linear potential $V(x)=\mu |x-x_0|$, where $\mu>0$ is the strength of the potential and $x_0>0$ is the position of the lowest point of the potential, which coincides with the starting position of the particle. The Brownian motion terminates whenever the particle passes through the origin at a random time $t_f$. Our study reveals that the mean first-passage time $\langle t_f \rangle$ exhibits a nonmonotonic behavior with respect to $\mu$, with a unique minimum occurring at an optimal value of $\mu \simeq 1.24468D/x_0$, where $D$ is the diffusion constant of the Brownian particle. Moreover, we examine the distribution $P(M|x_0)$ of the maximum displacement $M$ during the first-passage process, as well as the statistics of the time $t_m$ at which $M$ is reached. Intriguingly, there exists another optimal $\mu \simeq 1.24011 D/x_0$ that minimizes the mean time $\langle t_m \rangle$. All our analytical findings are corroborated through numerical simulations.

Title: Density-Independent Glassy Behavior in the High-Density Phase of Motility-Induced Phase Separation
Authors: Toranosuke Umemura, Issei Sakai, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits glassy behavior, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through this glassy phase. These findings provide insights into nonequilibrium phase transitions in active matter, revealing a robust glassy phase en route to solidification, and may guide future studies in both synthetic and biological active systems.

Title: Resonant dynamics of dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model with time-dependent tensor electric fields
Authors: Jiali Zhang, Shaoliang Zhang
Abstract: Recently, tensor gauge fields and their coupling to fracton phases of matter have attracted more and more research interest, and a series of novel quantum phenomena arising from the coupling has been predicted. In this article, we propose a theoretical scheme to construct a time-dependent rank-2 tensor electric field by introducing a periodically driving quadratic potential in a dipole-conserving Bose-Hubbard model, and investigate the dynamics of dipole and fracton excitations when the drive frequency is resonant with the on-site interaction. We find that the dynamics are dominated by the splitting of large dipoles with the photon-assisted correlated tunneling and the movement of small dipoles, both of which can be well controlled by the drive amplitude. Our work provides a possible approach for engineering the dynamics of dipole-conserving quantum systems via tensor gauge fields.

Title: Hydrogen bond symmetrization in high-pressure ice clathrates
Authors: Lorenzo Monacelli, Maria Rescigno, Alasdair Nicholls, Umbertoluca Ranieri, Simone Di Cataldo, Livia Eleonora Bove
Abstract: Hydrogen bond symmetrization is a fundamental pressure-induced transformation in which the distinction between donor and acceptor sites vanishes, resulting in a symmetric hydrogen-bond network. While extensively studied in pure ice, most notably during the ice VII to ice X transition, this phenomenon remains less well characterized in hydrogen hydrates. In this work, we investigate hydrogen bond symmetrization in the high-pressure phases of hydrogen hydrate (H2-H2O and H2-D2O) through a combined approach of Raman spectroscopy and first-principles quantum atomistic simulations. We focus on the C2 and C3 filled-ice phases, using both hydrogenated and deuterated water frameworks. Our results reveal that quantum fluctuations and the interaction between the encaged H2 molecules and the host lattice play a crucial role in driving the symmetrization process. Remarkably, we find that in both C2 and C3 phases, hydrogen bond symmetrization occurs via a continuous crossover at significantly lower pressures than in pure ice, without any change in the overall crystal symmetry. These findings provide new insight into the quantum-driven mechanisms of bond symmetrization in complex hydrogen-bonded systems under extreme conditions.

Title: Ab initio functional-independent calculations of the clamped Pockels tensor of tetragonal barium titanate
Authors: Virginie de Mestral, Lorenzo Bastonero, Michele Kotiuga, Marko Mladenovic, Nicola Marzari, Mathieu Luisier
Abstract: We present an ab initio method to calculate the clamped Pockels tensor of ferroelectric materials from density-functional theory, the modern theory of polarization exploiting the electric-enthalpy functional, and automated first- and second-order finite-difference derivatives of the polarizations and the Hellmann-Feynman forces. Thanks to the functional-independent capabilities of our approach, we can determine the Pockels tensor of tetragonal barium titanate (BTO) beyond the local density approximation (LDA), with arbitrary exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, for example, PBEsol. The latter, together with RRKJ ultra-soft pseudo-potentials (PP) and a supercell exhibiting local titanium off-centering, enables us to stabilize the negative optical phonon modes encountered in tetragonal BTO when LDA and norm-conserving PP are combined. As a result, the correct value range of $r_{51}$, the largest experimental Pockels coefficient of BTO, is recovered. We also reveal that $r_{51}$ increases with decreasing titanium off-centering for this material. The lessons learned from the structural, dielectric, and vibrational investigations of BTO will be essential to design next-generation electro-optical modulators based on the Pockels effect.

Title: Backsolution: A Framework for Solving Inverse Problems via Automatic Differentiation
Authors: Koji Kobayashi, Tomi Ohtsuki
Abstract: We present a simple yet powerful framework for solving inverse problems by leveraging automatic differentiation. Our method is broadly applicable whenever a smooth cost function can be defined near the true solution, and a numerical simulator is available. As a concrete example, we demonstrate that our method can accurately reconstruct the spatial profiles in a conductor from magnetotransport measurements. Even if the given data are insufficient to uniquely determine the profiles, the same framework enables effective reverse modeling. This method is general, flexible, and readily adaptable to a broad class of inverse problems across condensed matter physics and beyond.

Title: Two-photon 3D printing of functional microstructures inside living cells
Authors: Marusa Mur, Aljaz Kavcic, Uros Jagodic, Rok Podlipec, Matjaz Humar
Abstract: 3D printing has revolutionized numerous scientific fields and industries, with printing in biological systems emerging as a rapidly advancing area of research. However, its application to the subcellular level remains largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate for the first time the fabrication of custom-shaped polymeric microstructures directly inside living cells using two-photon polymerization. A biocompatible photoresist is injected into live cells and selectively polymerized with a femtosecond laser. The unpolymerized photoresist is dissolved naturally within the cytoplasm, leaving behind stable intracellular structures with submicron resolution within live cells. We printed various shapes, including a $10 \mu m$ elephant, barcodes for cell tracking, diffraction gratings for remote readout, and microlasers. Our top-down intracellular biofabrication approach, combined with existing functional photoresists, could open new avenues for various applications, including intracellular sensing, biomechanical manipulation, bioelectronics, and targeted intracellular drug delivery. Moreover, these embedded structures could offer unprecedented control over the intracellular environment, enabling the engineering of cellular properties beyond those found in nature.

Title: Penta-twinned gold nanoparticles under pressure: a comprehensive study
Authors: Camino Martín-Sáncheza, Ana Sánchez-Iglesias, José Antonio Barreda-Argüeso, Jean-Paul Itié, Paul Chauvigne, Luis M. Liz-Marzán, Fernando Rodríguez
Abstract: We report on the high-pressure optical and mechanical properties of penta-twinned gold nanoparticles (PT-AuNPs) of different geometries: decahedra, rods and bipyramids. Our results show that, unlike single-crystal (SC-AuNPs), PT-AuNPs preserve both their non-cubic crystal structures and their overall morphology up to 30 GPa. This structural integrity under compression is related to an enhanced mechanical resilience of PT-AuNPs, despite exhibiting bulk moduli comparable to those of SC-AuNPs. Notwithstanding, comparable pressure-induced localized surface plasmon resonance redshifts - for all nanoparticle geometries - were observed. Our analysis indicates that these shifts are primarily caused by changes in the refractive index of the surrounding medium, with electron density compression playing a minor role, contrasting with the behavior in SC-AuNPs, where electron density compression has a greater influence.

Title: Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields
Authors: Simon Brunner, Christian F. Schmidt, Stefan Floerchinger
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic scalar field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.

Title: Non-reciprocal interactions reshape cells in a model for symbiosis
Authors: Maitane Muñoz-Basagoiti, Michael Wassermair, Miguel Amaral, Buzz Baum, Anđela Šarić
Abstract: The shape of a cell influences and it is influenced by interactions with its neighbouring partners. Here, we introduce a coarse-grained model of non-reciprocal interactions between single-cell organisms to study emergent morphologies during symbiotic association. We show that the cell membrane can be remodelled into branched protrusions, invaginations, transient blebs and other dynamical phases that depend on the number of interacting partners, the asymmetry, and the magnitude of partnership activity. Our model finds a dynamical feedback between the local deformation of the membrane and its driving force, leading to morphologies not accessible to reciprocal systems.

Title: Inferring Material Parameters from Current-Voltage Curves in Organic Solar Cells via Neural-Network-Based Surrogate Models
Authors: Eunchi Kim, Paula Hartnagel, Barbara Urbano, Leonard Christen, Thomas Kirchartz
Abstract: Machine learning has emerged as a promising approach for estimating material parameters in solar cells. Traditional methods for parameter extraction often rely on time-consuming numerical simulations that fail to capture the full complexity of the parameter space and discard valuable information from suboptimal simulations. In this study, we introduce a novel workflow for parameter estimation in organic solar cells based on a combination of numerical simulations and neural networks. The workflow begins with the selection of an appropriate experimental dataset, followed by the definition of a device model that accurately describes the experiment. To reduce computational complexity, the number of variable parameters is carefully selected, and reasonable ranges are set for each parameter. Instead of directly fitting the experimental data using a numerical model, a neural network was trained on a large dataset of simulated results, allowing for efficient exploration of the high-dimensional parameter space. This approach not only accelerates the parameter estimation process but also provides valuable insights into the likelihood and uncertainty of the estimated parameters. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method on organic solar cells based on the PBDB-TF-T1:BTP-4F-12 material system, demonstrating the potential of machine learning for rapid and comprehensive characterization of emerging photovoltaic materials.

Title: Tuning the Viscosity and Jamming Point in Dense Active non-Brownian Suspensions
Authors: Bhanu Prasad Bhowmik
Abstract: Using numerical simulations, we study the rheological response of dense non-Brownian suspensions containing active particles. The active particles are modelled as run-and-tumble particles with three controlling parameters: the fraction of active particles in the system, an active force applied to the particles, and a persistence time after which the direction of the active force changes randomly. Our simulations reveal that the presence of activity can reduce the viscosity (by an order of magnitude) by decreasing the number of frictional contacts, which also shifts the jamming point to a higher volume fraction. Moreover, the microscopic structure of force chains in the presence of activity is qualitatively different from that in the passive system, showing reduced anisotropy. We also find that while the presence of activity drives the system away from jamming by preventing the formation of force chains, unjamming an already jammed state by breaking existing force chains requires a higher activity strength. Finally, we propose a new constitutive law to describe the rheology of dense active non-Brownian suspensions.

Title: Computing and compressing local vertex functions in imaginary and real frequencies from the multipoint numerical renormalization group using quantics tensor cross interpolation
Authors: Markus Frankenbach, Marc Ritter, Mathias Pelz, Nepomuk Ritz, Jan von Delft, Anxiang Ge
Abstract: The multipoint numerical renormalization group (mpNRG) is a powerful impurity solver that provides accurate spectral data useful for computing local, dynamic correlation functions in imaginary or real frequencies non-perturbatively across a wide range of interactions and temperatures. It gives access to a local, non-perturbative four-point vertex in imaginary and real frequencies, which can be used as input for subsequent computations such as diagrammatic extensions of dynamical mean--field theory. However, computing and manipulating the real-frequency four-point vertex on large, dense grids quickly becomes numerically challenging when the density and/or the extent of the frequency grid is increased. In this paper, we compute four-point vertices in a strongly compressed quantics tensor train format using quantics tensor cross interpolation, starting from discrete partial spectral functions obtained from mpNRG. This enables evaluations of the vertex on frequency grids with resolutions far beyond the reach of previous implementations. We benchmark this approach on the four-point vertex of the single-impurity Anderson model across a wide range of physical parameters, both in its full form and its asymptotic decomposition. For imaginary frequencies, the full vertex can be represented to an accuracy on the order of $2\cdot 10^{-3}$ with maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 120. The more complex full real-frequency vertex requires maximum bond dimensions not exceeding 170 for an accuracy of $\lesssim 2\%$. Our work marks another step toward tensor-train-based diagrammatic calculations for correlated electronic lattice models starting from a local, non-perturbative mpNRG vertex.

Title: Tunneling conductance in superconducting junctions with $p$-wave unconventional magnets breaking time-reversal symmetry
Authors: Yuri Fukaya, Keiji Yada, Yukio Tanaka
Abstract: A new type of magnet called $p$-wave unconventional magnet is proposed, stimulated by the discovery of altermagnet. We study the tunneling conductance of $p$-wave unconventional magnet/superconductor junctions by adopting the effective Hamiltonian of $p$-wave unconventional magnets with time-reversal symmetry breaking, suggested in Ref [arXiv: 2309.01607 (2024)]. The tunneling conductance shows an asymmetric behavior with respect to bias voltage in the helical $p$-wave superconductor junctions. It is caused by the lack of helical edge states contributing to the charge conductance owing to the momentum-dependent spin-split feature of the Fermi surface in $p$-wave unconventional magnets. In chiral $d$ and $p$-wave superconductor junctions, the resulting spin-resolved tunneling conductance takes a different value for spin sectors due to the time-reversal symmetry breaking in superconductors. Our results qualitatively reproduce the results based on the simplified Hamiltonian in Ref [J.\ Phys.\ Soc.\ Jpn.\ \textbf{93}, 114703 (2024)], where only the odd function of the exchange coupling of $p$-wave unconventional magnets is taken into account, which gives the shift of the Fermi surface and preserves the time-reversal symmetry similar to the spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Statistical analysis of electron-induced switching of a spin-crossover complex
Authors: Jonas Fußangel, Björn Sothmann, Sven Johannsen, Sascha Ossinger, Felix Tuczek, Richard Berndt, Jürgen König, Manuel Gruber
Abstract: Spin-crossover complexes exhibit two stable configurations with distinct spin states. The investigation of these molecules using low-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy has opened new perspectives for understanding the associated switching mechanisms at the single-molecule level. While the role of tunneling electrons in driving the spin-state switching has been clearly evidenced, the underlying microscopic mechanism is not completely understood. In this study, we investigate the electron-induced switching of [Fe(H$_2$B(pz)(pypz))$_2$] (pz = pyrazole, pypz = pyridylpyrazole) adsorbed on Ag(111). The current time traces show transitions between two current levels corresponding to the two spin states. We extract switching rates from these traces by analyzing waiting-time distributions. Their sample-voltage dependence can be explained within a simple model in which the switching is triggered by a transient charging of the molecule. The comparison between experimental data and theoretical modeling provides estimates for the energies of the lowest unoccupied molecular orbitals, which were so far experimentally inaccessible. Overall, our approach offers new insights into the electron-induced switching mechanism and predicts enhanced switching rates upon electronic decoupling of the molecule from the metallic substrate, for example by introducing an ultrathin insulating layer.

Title: Uncovering the nanoscopic phase behavior of ternary solutions in the presence of electrolytes: from pre-Ouzo to Ouzo region
Authors: Mingbo Li, Rushi Lai, Yadi Tian, Yawen Gao, Benlong Wang, Chao Sun
Abstract: In this work, we report a comprehensive study of how electrolyte addition governs the structure and stability of surfactant-free microemulsions in a trans-anethol/ethanol/water system. The universal structural response has been validated, spanning the full range of solution dispersed-phase structurings, from sub-10 nm W/O reverse-aggregates to O/W mesoscopic droplets (~100 nm) and classical Ouzo droplets (~1 {\mu}m). Experimental results reveal that there is a threshold for electrolyte levels above which oil-in-water nanodroplet coalescence and phase separation are triggered: screening of electrical double layers and "salting out" of hydrophobic components drives hydrotrope into fewer, larger droplets. The total oil volume sequestered in the dispersed phase remains essentially constant, indicating oil redistribution rather than dissolution. In contrast, water-in-oil nanodroplets in a predominantly organic medium display near-complete insensitivity to ionic strength, owing to low dielectric screening and tight interfacial packing that exclude substantial ion uptake. Finally, addition of high salt to Ouzo droplets accelerates their collapse: large droplets fuse and sediment, leaving only residual nanostructures and confirming electrolyte-driven phase demixing. This insight offers clear guidelines for designing additive-free emulsions with tailored lifetimes and nanostructure architectures across pharmaceutical, food, and materials applications.

Title: Crystal field tuned spin-flip luminescence in NiPS3
Authors: Léonard Schue, Nashra Pistawala, Hebatalla Elnaggar, Yannick Klein, Christophe Bellin, Johan Biscaras, Fausto Sirotti, Yves Lassailly, Fabian Cadiz, Luminita Harnagea, Abhay Shukla
Abstract: Layered magnetic materials potentially hold the key to future applications based on optical control and manipulation of magnetism. NiPS3, a prototype member of this family, is antiferromagnetic below 155 K and exhibits sharp photoluminescence associated to a transition between a triplet ground state and a singlet excited state. The nature of the luminescent transition is a matter of current debate and so is an eventual fundamental link of this excitation to magnetism. Here we provide answers through experiments and calculations. We fabricate samples with metal and ligand substitutions which alter the Neel transition temperature and measure the effects of these changes on the temperature dependent photoluminescence. We perform crystal field and charge transfer multiplet calculations to explain the origin of the excitation and identify the effects of the magnetic ground state on its properties. These measurements and calculations provide a comprehensive explanation for the observed properties and a template for finding similar materials exhibiting spin-flip luminescence.

Title: Role of topotactic hydrogen in Superconductivity of Infinite-layer Nickelate NdNiO$_{2}$: A first-principles and variational Monte Carlo study
Authors: Manoj Gupta, Arun Kumar Maurya, Amal Medhi, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta
Abstract: Employing combination of first-principles calculations, low-energy model construction, and variational Monte Carlo solution of the ab-initio derived Hubbard model, we study the effect of hydrogenation in the electronic structure and superconducting properties of infinite-layer nickelate, NdNiO$_2$. We find that the introduction of hydrogen at the apical oxygen vacancy position strongly influences the Wannier function corresponding to the effective interstitial orbital at the Ni site bound to the hydrogen. This results in the near disappearance of the electron pocket at the $k_z$ = $\pi$ Fermi surface, keeping that of $k_z$ = 0 unchanged, compared to the dehydrogenated case. The two-band model thus remains valid even in the presence of H. The calculated superconducting order parameters both in absence and presence of H, show a two-hump superconductivity arising the two overlapping domes, one arising from $d_{x^{2}-y^{2}}$ and another arising from interstitial orbital degree of freedom. Hydrogenation strengthens the latter, marginally affecting the former.

Title: 2D MXene-Based Photocatalysts for Efficient Water Splitting and Hydrogen Evolution: A brief review
Authors: C. B. Subba, Prasad Mattipally, J. Sivakumar, A. Laref, A. Yvaz, D. P. Rai, Z. Pachuau
Abstract: Photocatalytic water splitting offers a viable and sustainable method for hydrogen production. MXenes, a class of 2D transition-metal carbides/nitrides, have emerged as potential photocatalysts and co-catalysts due to their tunable electronic properties, high conductivity, and surface functionality. This review explores recent advances in MXene-based photocatalysts for hydrogen production, discussing their synthesis, electronic structures, and photocatalytic mechanisms. The key challenges, including stability issues, charge recombination, and bandgap optimisation, are critically analysed. Finally, future research directions are outlined to improve MXene-based systems for large-scale hydrogen production.

Title: Self-consistent Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach for bosons: self-eliminating divergence and pure pair condensate
Authors: M. Bulakhov, A. S. Peletminskii
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of an interacting Bose gas with a condensate within the energy-functional formulation of the Hartree-Fock-Bogoliubov approach. For a contact interaction, we derive a self-consistent solution to the HFB equations that intrinsically eliminates divergence. This solution characterizes the equilibrium state featuring a condensate of correlated pairs of particles. We analyze the temperature dependence of key thermodynamic quantities such as condensate density, chemical potential, entropy, pressure, specific heat capacity at constant volume, and isothermal compressibility and compare them with predictions from the Popov approximation. Our results reveal a first-order phase transition between the normal state and the degenerate state, accompanied by an increased transition temperature relative to the ideal Bose gas. Analysis of the compressibility indicates that a pure pair condensate is unstable, and the stable equilibrium corresponds to a mixture of single-particle and pair condensates.

Title: Sodium induced beneficial effects in wide bandgap Cu(In,Ga)S2 solar cell with 15.7% efficiency
Authors: Arivazhagan Valluvar Oli, Kulwinder Kaur, Michele Melchiorre, Aubin Jean-Claude Mireille Prot, Sevan Gharabeiki, Yucheng Hu, Gunnar Kusch, Adam Hultqvist, Tobias Törndahl, Wolfram Hempel, Wolfram Witte, Rachel A. Oliver, Susanne Siebentritt
Abstract: This study underscores the pivotal role of sodium (Na) supply in optimizing the optoelectronic properties of wide bandgap (~1.6 eV) Cu(In,Ga)S2 (CIGS) thin film absorbers for high efficiency solar cells. Our findings demonstrate that the synergistic use of Na from the glass substrate, in conjunction with in-situ sodium fluoride (NaF) co-evaporation, significantly enhances the structural and optoelectronic properties of the CIGS. CIGS grown under either Na-deficient or excess conditions exhibits inferior microstructural and optoelectronic properties, whereas an optimal Na supply leads to enhanced photovoltaic performance. Optimal Na incorporation minimizes vertical gallium fluctuations and improves the grain size and crystallinity. An absolute 1 sun calibrated photoluminescence (PL) measurement reveals a substantial suppression of bulk defects and a reduction in non-radiative losses, resulting in a high quasi-fermi level splitting ({\Delta}EF) of 1.07 eV, 93 meV higher than in Na-deficient CIGS with the same bandgap. Optimal Na supply further increases excited carrier decay time, as revealed from time-resolved PL, and hole doping density. Cross-sectional hyperspectral cathodoluminescence mapping reveals that optimal Na supply significantly reduces defect density near the surface, thereby effectively translating {\Delta}EF to open-circuit voltage (VOC). As a result, a champion wide bandgap CIGS solar cell with a cadmium-free ZnSnO buffer layer achieved an impressive VOC of 971 meV and an active area power conversion efficiency of 15.7%, highlighting its potential for advancing tandem photovoltaic technologies with stable inorganic top cell.

Title: Excitations and dynamical structure factor of $J_1-J_2$ spin-$3/2$ and spin-$5/2$ Heisenberg spin chains
Authors: Aman Sharma, Mithilesh Nayak, Natalia Chepiga, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: We study the dynamical structure factor of the frustrated spin-$3/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg chains, with particular focus on the partially dimerized phase that emerges between two Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Using a valence bond solid ansatz corroborated by density matrix renormalization group simulations, we investigate the nature of magnon and spinon excitations through the single-mode approximation. We show that the magnon develops an incommensurate dispersion at $J_2 \approx 0.32J_1$, while the spinons, viewed as domain walls between degenerate valence bond solid states, become incommensurate at $J_2 \approx 0.4J_1$ beyond the Lifshitz point ($J_2 \approx 0.388J_1$). The dynamical structure factor exhibits rich spectral features shaped by the interplay between these excitations, with magnons appearing as resonances embedded in the spinon continuum. The spinon gap shows a nonmonotonic behavior, reaching a peak near the center of the partially dimerized phase and closing at the boundaries, suggesting the appearance of a floating phase as a result of the condensation of incommensurate spinons. Comparative analysis with the spin-$5/2$ case confirms the universality of these phenomena across half-integer higher-spin systems. Our results provide detailed insight into how fractionalization and incommensurate condensation govern the spectral properties of frustrated spin chains, offering a unified picture across different spin magnitudes.

Title: From Brittle to Ductile and Back: Reentrant Fracture Transition in Disordered Two-Phase Solids
Authors: Subrat Senapati, Anuradha Banerjee, R Rajesh
Abstract: Fracture processes in multi-phase solids are inherently complex due to multiple competing mechanisms. Here, we investigate the elastic and fracture behaviour of two-phase solids, comprising a fragile phase and a tough phase using a disordered spring network model. The macroscopic response is found to depend on the failure strain mismatch, the elastic modulus ratio, as well as the relative composition of the constituent phases. As the proportion of the tough phase increases, the system undergoes a reentrant phase transition in fracture behaviour: from brittle to ductile-like and back to brittle. These transitions are identified through both avalanche statistics and cluster size characteristics of broken springs. Notably, the avalanche exponent associated with the majority phase changes universality class during the brittle to ductile transition. Analysis of time evolution of cluster characteristics reveals distinct growth mechanisms in the two regimes. In the brittle regime, dominant clusters rapidly absorb other large clusters, keeping the total number of clusters nearly constant. In contrast, the ductile regime is characterised by more gradual coalescence, leading to a decrease in the total number of clusters over time while their average size increases. We provide a physical interpretation of the mechanisms underlying the observed switch in fracture behaviour.

Title: Electronic Correlations Control Interlayer Coupling and Magnetic Transition in MnBi$_2$Te$_4$/MnBr$_3$ Heterostructure
Authors: Yuanhao Zhu, Xixi Yuan, Ying Zhao, Jin Zhang, Zijing Ding, Huixia Fu
Abstract: Bulk MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ (MBT) is an intrinsic antiferromagnetic topological insulator. However, its low Néel temperature of $\sim 25\,\mathrm{K}$ severely restricts its practical applications. Here, we propose a van der Waals heterostructure composed of monolayer MBT (ML-MBT) and monolayer MnBr$_3$, an intrinsic Chern insulator possessing a high Curie temperature ($T_\mathrm{C} \sim 200\,\mathrm{K}$). By employing density functional theory calculations and Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that interfacing ML-MBT with MnBr$_3$ significantly enhances the $T_\mathrm{C}$ of ML-MBT by a factor of four to five. Electronic correlations characterized by the Hubbard parameter $U_2$ for Mn-$d$ orbitals in MnBr$_3$ play a crucial role in governing magnetic coupling within the system. At a moderate correlation strength of $U_2 = 3.0\,\mathrm{eV}$, slight structural distortions in MnBr$_3$ break intralayer symmetry, enabling robust interlayer ferromagnetic coupling and yielding a single, unified magnetic transition. Increasing $U_2$ reduces these structural distortions, weakens interlayer coupling, and induces two distinct magnetic transitions, indicating interlayer magnetic decoupling. Thus, the MBT/MnBr$_3$ heterostructure offers a novel approach for controlling magnetic order and enhancing the performance of spintronic devices.

Title: A first-principles investigation of altermagnetism in CrSb2 under applied pressure
Authors: R. Tamang, Shivraj Gurung, Shalika Ram Bhandari, Matthew J. Stitz, Ganesh Pokharel, Keshav Shrestha, D. P. Rai
Abstract: In this study, we employed first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations within the GGA+U framework to explore the electronic and magnetic properties of CrSb2 under varying hydrostatic pressures. CrSb2 exhibits non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) of around 0.5 eV around the Fermi level and the d-wave symmetric Fermi surface. Our magnetic susceptibility measurements further confirm the collinear antiferromagnetic (AFM) ground state in CrSb2 , a prerequisite for altermagnetism. The presence of collinear AFM and spin-band splitting without the application of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) supports CrSb2 as a potential contender for altermagnet. With increasing pressure, we have observed an intricate evolution of spin splitting in the valence and conduction bands, governed by changes in orbital contributions. The observation of the structural phase transition above 10 GPa is in qualitative agreement with the previous experimental findings. Our results not only support the classification of CrSb2 as an altermagnetic candidate but also provide critical insight into the role of pressure in tuning its spin-dependent electronic structure.

Title: On the diffusion of hard sphere fluids in disordered porous media: New extended Enskog theory description
Authors: M. F. Holovko, M. Ya. Korvatska
Abstract: We proposed a new extended version of Enskog theory for the description of the self-diffusion coefficient of a colloidal hard-sphere fluid adsorbed in a matrix of disordered hard-sphere obstacles. In a considered approach instead of contact values of the fluid-fluid and fluid-matrix pair distribution functions, we introduced by input the new functions that include the dependence on the fraction of the volume free from matrix particles and from fluid particles trapped by matrix particles. It is shown that the introduction of this free volume fraction by the Fermi-like distribution leads to the best agreement between theoretical predictions and computer simulation results [Chang R., Jagannathan K., Yethiraj A., Phys. Rev. E, 2004, 69, 051101].

Title: Nonlinear bulk photocurrent probe Z2 topological phase transition
Authors: Debasis Dutta, Raihan Ahammed, Yingdong Wei, Xiaokai Pan, Xiaoshuang Chen, Lin Wang, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Detecting topological phase transitions in bulk is challenging due to the limitations of surface sensitive probes like ARPES. Here, we demonstrate that nonlinear bulk photocurrents, specifically shift and injection currents, serve as effective probes of Z_2 topological transitions. These photocurrents show a robust polarity reversal across the Z_2 phase transition, offering a direct optical signature that distinguishes strong topological phases from weak or trivial ones. This effect originates from a reorganization of key band geometric quantities, the Berry curvature and shift vector, on time-reversal-invariant momentum planes. Using a low energy Dirac model, we trace this behaviour to a band inversion in the time-reversal-invariant momentum plane that drives the topological transition. We validate these findings through tight-binding model for Bi_2Te_3 and first-principles calculations for ZrTe_5 and BiTeI, where the topological phase can be tuned by pressure or temperature. Our results establish nonlinear photocurrent as a sensitive and broadly applicable probe of Z_2 topological phase transitions.

Title: On the ambient conditions crystal structure of AgSbTe2
Authors: Baihong Sun, Sergei Grazhdannikov, Muhamed Dawod, Lunhua He, Jiazheng Hao, Thomas Meier, Yansun Yao, Yaron Amouyal, Elissaios Stavrou
Abstract: We present a combined X-ray and neutron diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, and 121Sb NMR studies of AgSbTe2, supported by first-principles calculations aiming to elucidate its crystal structure. While diffraction methods cannot unambiguously resolve the structure, Raman and NMR data, together with electric field gradient calculations, strongly support the rhombohedral R-3m phase. Moreover, the agreement between experimental and calculated Raman spectra further corroborates this result, resolving the 60-year sold debate about the exact crystal structure of the AgSbTe2 compound.

Title: Extrinsic Dopants as Growth Modifiers in Cu-Cr-O delafossites: A Study of Incorporation Limits and Film Properties
Authors: Marco Moreira, Yves Fleming, Patrick Grysan, Christele Vergne, Adrian Marie Philippe, Petru Lunca-Popa
Abstract: Cu-Cr-O delafossite thin films were grown by metal-organic chemical vapor deposition with various extrinsic dopants (Al, Mg, Mn, Sc, Y, and Zn) targeted at 5 at % to investigate how such doping influences their structure and properties. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy revealed that the actual dopant incorporation is well below the nominal 5 %, with only Al and Sc present above detection. An off-stoichiometric Cu-Cr-O composition is determined, with no secondary phases detected. Transmission electron microscopy indicates that films grown on c-plane sapphire are epitaxial near the substrate interface but relax into a polycrystalline structure beyond 20 nm, while films on silicon are polycrystalline throughout. All films show high p-type conductivity (on the order of 10-10^2 Scm-1) attributable to the excess oxygen, with no significant variation among different dopants. Optical transmission measurements indicate a slight red-shift (~20 nm) of the absorption edge for all doped films, likely arising from strain effects and subtle structural disorder introduced during growth. We discuss the influence of lattice strain (investigated by X-ray diffraction sin {\psi} squared measurements showing residual strain) and small polaron absorption behavior in these films. Despite limited incorporation of dopants, subtle structural and optical shifts suggest that dopant precursor chemistry and growth conditions play a significant role in influencing film stoichiometry and properties.

Title: Faceting transition in aluminum as a grain boundary phase transition
Authors: Yoonji Choi, Tobias Brink
Abstract: Grain boundaries facet due to anisotropic grain boundary energies: While the faceted boundary has a larger area than the corresponding straight boundary, a significantly lower energy of the facets compared to a straight segment can drive the faceting. This picture is complicated by faceting/defaceting transitions where the free energy difference between the two states depends on the temperature. Here, we use atomistic computer simulations to show how such a transition in a $\Sigma 3$ $[11\overline{1}]$ tilt grain boundary in Al is in fact a grain boundary phase transition (also called complexion transition). This means that the faceted and defaceted boundaries are associated with different atomic structures, which have different thermodynamic stability ranges. At low temperatures, the grain boundary phase associated with faceting is stable, while at high temperatures the flat grain boundary phase is stable. We also report on our thorough tests of Al interatomic potentials for this purpose, which include comparisons to density-functional theory calculations. Our chosen potential performs well for our grain boundaries. As a consequence we were able to obtain results that align with previous experimental results.

Title: Superconductivity with repulsion: a variational approach
Authors: Laura Fanfarillo, Yifu Cao, Chandan Setty, Sergio Caprara, Peter J. Hirschfeld
Abstract: We revisit the stability of the superconducting state within mean-field theory in the presence of repulsive pairing interactions, focusing on multiband systems where such channels naturally arise. We show that, when repulsion is present, the self-consistent BCS solution appears as a saddle point of the conventional mean-field free energy, casting doubt on its physical stability. We show that this pathology is an artifact of using a non-variational functional. Recasting the problem with Bogoliubov's variational principle restores a free energy that is bounded from below and places the BCS solution at a genuine minimum. Using a two-band toy model relevant to iron-based superconductors, we demonstrate the stability of the s$_\pm$ state and clarify how projection schemes that rely only on the interaction matrix can misidentify the attractive eigenmode that drives pairing. Our results clarify the instability issue highlighted by Aase et al. and provide a consistent foundation for analyzing fluctuations in the presence of repulsive interactions.

Title: Emergent topology in thin films of nodal line semimetals
Authors: Faruk Abdulla
Abstract: We investigate finite-size topological phases in thin films of nodal line semimetals (co-dimension 2) in three dimensions. By analyzing the hybridization of drumhead surface states, we demonstrate that such systems can transition into either a lower-dimensional nodal line state (co-dimension 1) or a fully gapped trivial phase. Additionally, we explore the hybridization of bulk states along the nodal loop when the system is finite in directions parallel to the loop's plane. This generally results in a topologically nontrivial gap. In films finite along a single in-plane direction, a partial gap opens, giving rise to two-dimensional Weyl cones characterized by a one-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant. When the system is finite along both in-plane directions, a fully gapped phase appears, distinguished by a $\mathbb{Z}$ invariant whose value increases with film thickness. We further discuss the bulk-boundary correspondence associated with these emergent topological phases.

Title: Observation of many-body coherence in quasi-one-dimensional attractive Bose gases
Authors: Hikaru Tamura, Sambit Banerjee, Rongjie Li, Panayotis Kevrekidis, Simeon I. Mistakidis, Chen-Lung Hung
Abstract: Macroscopic coherence is an important feature of quantum many-body systems exhibiting collective behaviors, with examples ranging from atomic Bose-Einstein condensates, and quantum liquids to superconductors. Probing many-body coherence in a dynamically unstable regime, however, presents an intriguing and outstanding challenge in out-of-equilibrium quantum many-body physics. Here, we experimentally study the first- and second-order coherence of degenerate quasi-one-dimensional (1D) Bose gases quenched from repulsive to modulationally unstable attractive interaction regimes. The resulting dynamics, monitored by in-situ density and matter-wave interference imaging, reveals phase-coherent density wave evolutions arising from the interplay between noise-amplified density modulations and dispersive shock waves of broad interest within nonlinear physics. At longer times, the gases become phase-scrambled, exhibiting a finite correlation length. Interestingly, following an interaction quench back to the repulsive regime, we observe that quasi-long-range coherence can be spontaneously re-established. This captivating rephasing dynamics can be attributed to the nucleation and annihilation of density defects in the quasi-1D geometry. These results shed light on out-of-equilibrium phase coherence in quantum many-body systems in a regime where beyond mean-field effects may arise and theoretical approaches have not been well-established.

Title: Searching for topological semi-complete bandgap in elastic truss lattices
Authors: Yiran Hao, Dong Liu, Liyou Luo, Jialu Mu, Hanyu Wang, Zibo Liu, Jensen Li, Zhihong Zhu, Qinghua Guo, Biao Yang
Abstract: Gapless topological phases have attracted significant interest across both quantum and classical systems owing to their novel physics and promising applications. However, the search for ideal gapless topological nodes inside a clear bandgap is still lacking in elastic systems. The degenerate points are always hidden in the trivial bulk bands due to the intricate elastic modes involved. Here, we find a topological semi-complete bandgap in a three-dimensional elastic truss lattice by tuning a supporting rod, which exhibits a complete bandgap except for the inevitable topological degenerate points. Furthermore, we experimentally map the topological semi-complete bandgap and the inside nontrivial surface state arcs with a scanning laser vibrometer. The introduced scheme provides a systematic approach for the idealization of semi-complete bandgaps and thus may significantly advance the practical utility of topological phases in mechanical engineering domains.

Title: Freestanding single-crystal superconducting electron-doped cuprate membrane
Authors: Shay Sandik, Bat-Chen Elshalem, Amram Azulay, Mye Waisbort, Amit Kohn, Beena Kalisky, Yoram Dagan
Abstract: Thin films of cuprate superconductors are easier to control in terms of doping as compared to bulk samples. However, they require specific substrates to facilitate epitaxial growth. These substrates are often incompatible with materials used in electronic applications. Furthermore, it is challenging to separate the substrate's properties from the material of interest. Here, we demonstrate the fabrication of an electron-doped cuprate membrane. We show that the membrane has a coherent crystal structure. Furthermore, the superconducting properties of the membrane post-liftoff closely resemble those of the thin films pre-lift-off, as revealed by a scanning superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope. Such membranes pave the way for designing new material properties and incorporating complex superconducting materials into typically incompatible electronic devices.

Title: Quantifying stored energy release in irradiated YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$ through molecular dynamics annealing simulations
Authors: Lauryn Kortman, Alexis Devitre, Charles Hirst
Abstract: Over the lifetime of a fusion power plant, irradiation-induced defects will accumulate in the superconducting magnets compromising their ability to carry current without losses, generate high magnetic fields, and thus maintain plasma confinement. These defects also store potential energy within the crystalline lattice of materials, which can be released upon annealing. This phenomenon raises the question of whether the energy stored in defects may be sufficient to accelerate, or even trigger, a magnet quench? To provide an order of magnitude estimate, we used molecular dynamics simulations to generate defected YBCO supercells and conduct isothermal annealing simulations. Our results reveal that the maximum volumetric stored energy in a 4 mDPA defected single crystal of YBCO (240 $J/cm^3$) is 30 times greater than the experimental minimum quench energy values for YBCO tapes (8.1 $J/cm^3$). Our simulations also show that the amount of energy released increases as a function of annealing temperature or irradiation dose. This trend demonstrates that localized heating events in an irradiated fusion magnet have the potential to release significant amounts of defect energy. These findings underscore the critical need for experimental validation of the accumulation and release of defect stored energy, and highlight the importance of incorporating this contribution into quench detection systems, to enhance the operational safety of large-scale YBCO fusion magnets.

Title: Anomalous Superfluid Density in Pair-Density-Wave Superconductors
Authors: Ke Wang, Qijin Chen, Rufus Boyack, K. Levin
Abstract: We study the superfluid density $n_s(T)$ of pair-density-wave (PDW) superconductors; this determines where they are unstable and establishes signatures of their unusual order. Here we compute $n_s(T)$ for the 2D unidirectional PDW superconducting phases that emerge from a microscopic model (with nearest neighbor attraction). With gapped and gapless bands in the Bogoliubov quasiparticle dispersion, this theory provides self-consistently determined wavevectors \(\mathbf{Q}\) for the spatially modulated pairing. We report a negative $n_s$ for a significant fraction of the purportedly physical phase diagram. Independent of the microscopic model, we can generally understand that the implied instability in these superconductors arises from the variationally large \(|\mathbf{Q}|\). In the stable regime, the finite-temperature superfluid density \(n_s(T)\) displays unusual temperature dependences originating from the gapless Bogoliubov bands which reflect Van Hove-singularity-induced Sommerfeld contributions. These gapless bands, as well as the negative contributions from the Higgs mode, additionally lead to an anomalously small (highly anisotropic) superfluid density. This will then yield an unexpectedly large finite-frequency weight in the optical conductivity.

Title: Viscosity, breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation and dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquid Ge 2 Sb 2 Te 5 from simulations with a neural network potential
Authors: Simone Marcorini, Rocco Pomodoro, Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in non-volatile electronic memories and photonic devices that rely on a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and crystalline phase upon heating. The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\eta$, $D$ and the $\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The analysis revealed that the regions of most mobile atoms are related to the presence of Ge atoms with particular local environments.

Title: Significant role of first-principles electron-phonon coupling in the electronic and thermoelectric properties of LiZnAs and ScAgC semiconductors
Authors: Vinod Kumar Solet, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The half-Heusler (hH) compounds are currently considered promising thermoelectric (TE) materials due to their favorable thermopower and electrical conductivity. Accurate estimates of these properties are therefore highly desirable and require a detailed understanding of the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport. To enable such estimations, we carry out comprehensive first-principles computations of one of the primary factors limiting carrier transport, namely the electron-phonon ($e-ph$) interaction, in representative hH semiconductors such as LiZnAs and ScAgC. Our study first investigates the $e-ph$ renormalization of electronic dispersion based on the non-adiabatic Allen-Heine-Cardona theory. We then solve the Boltzmann transport equation (BTE) under multiple relaxation-time approximations (RTAs) to evaluate the carrier transport properties. Phonon-limited electron and hole mobilities are comparatively assessed using the linearized self-energy and momentum RTAs (SERTA and MRTA), and the exact or iterative BTE (IBTE) solutions within $e-ph$ coupling. Electrical transport coefficients for TE performance are also comparatively analyzed under the constant RTA (CRTA), SERTA, and MRTA schemes. The lattice thermal conductivity, determined from phonon-phonon interaction, is further reduced through nanostructuring techniques. The bulk LiZnAs (ScAgC) compound achieves the highest figure of merit ($zT$) of 1.05 (0.78) at 900 K with an electron doping concentration of 10$^{18}$ (10$^{19}$) cm$^{-3}$ under the MRTA scheme. This value significantly increases to 1.53 (1.0) for a 20 nm nanostructured sample. The remarkably high $zT$ achieved through inherently present phonon-induced electron scattering and the grain-boundary effect in semiconductors opens a promising path for discovering highly efficient and accurate hH materials for TE technology.

Title: Observing the Birth of Rydberg Exciton Fermi Polarons on a Moire Fermi Sea
Authors: Eric A. Arsenault, Gillian E. Minarik, Jiaqi Cai, Minhao He, Yiliu Li, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Dmitri Basov, Matthew Yankowitz, Xiaodong Xu, X.-Y. Zhu
Abstract: The optical spectra of two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors are dominated by tightly bound excitons and trions. In the low doping limit, trions are often described as three-body quasiparticles consisting of two electrons and one hole or vice versa. However, trions are more rigorously understood as quasiparticles arising from the interaction between an exciton and excitation of the Fermi sea - referred to as exciton Fermi polaron. Here we employ pump-probe spectroscopy to directly observe the formation of exciton Fermi polarons in a model system composed of a WSe2 monolayer adjacent to twisted bilayer graphene (tBLG). Following the pump-injection of Rydberg excitons in WSe2, a time-delayed probe pulse tracks the development of Rydberg exciton Fermi polarons as interactions with localized carriers in the tBLG moire superlattice evolve. Both the exciton Fermi polaron relaxation rate and binding energy are found to increase with electron or hole density. Our findings provide insight into the optical response of fundamental excitations in 2D Van der Waals systems and reveal how many-body interactions give rise to emergent quasiparticles.

Title: Photomagnetic-Chiral Anisotropy mediated by Chirality-Driven Asymmetric Spin Splitting
Authors: Tianwei Ouyang, Hang Su, Wanning Zhang, Yingying Duan, Yuxi Fang, Shunai Che, Yizhou Liu
Abstract: Photo-magnetic effects (PMEs), intrinsic to transition metals, arises from the interaction between light-induced angu-lar momentum and electronic spin. These effects are suppressed in noble metals with high symmetry and electron density. Introducing chiral structures can induce photomagnetic-chiral anisotropy (PM-ChA) of metals by linking chirality and spin dynamics. However, a theoretical explain remains elusive. Here, we investigated the mechanism of PM-ChA in tetrahelix-stacked chiral nanostructured gold chains (CNACs) using first-principles calculations. Non-equilibrium Green's function calculations reveal that chiral potentials enhance spin channel asymmetry by amplify-ing spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced spin splitting. Real-time time-dependent density functional theory simulations further identify SOC as the bridge connecting chiral spintronics to PME, where chirality-driven spin flips from asymmetric geometries generate opposing photomagnetic fields in materials of different handedness. These findings are consistent with experimental observations in chiral nanostructured gold films and provide a theoretical instruction for design metallic spintronic devices.

Title: Dimer-projection contact and the clock shift of a unitary Fermi gas
Authors: Kevin G. S. Xie, Colin J. Dale, Kiera Pond Grehan, Maggie Fen Wang, Tilman Enss, Paul S. Julienne, Zhenhua Yu, Joseph H. Thywissen
Abstract: The time evolution of the contact parameter provides key insights into correlation dynamics in ultracold gases. However, most contact measurements to date have focused on equilibrium systems or slow, global dynamics. Here, we demonstrate that projecting a unitary Fermi gas onto a low-lying dimer state enables rapid probing of the contact. Using $^{40}$K near a broad s-wave Feshbach resonance, we compare the strength of the dimer-projection feature to the strength of the high-frequency tail of radio-frequency spectroscopy. By tuning the correlation strength through temperature, we find that the dimer signal scales proportionally with the contact parameter, in agreement with coupled-channels calculations. Our measurements enable us to constrain the clock shift of the unitary Fermi gas, to which the dimer feature is the dominant contributor. We observe deviations from universal predictions due to finite-range and multichannel effects. Our results establish new universal contact relations and shed light on the structure of the clock shift in strongly interacting Fermi gases. The demonstrated ability to resolve short-range correlations on timescales shorter than the inverse Fermi energy opens new avenues for studying contact correlators, hydrodynamic attractors, and quantum critical behavior.

Title: Catalogue of chiral phonon materials
Authors: Yue Yang, Zhenyu Xiao, Yu Mao, Zhanghuan Li, Zhenyang Wang, Tianqi Deng, Yanhao Tang, Zhi-Da Song, Yuan Li, Huiqiu Yuan, Ming Shi, Yuanfeng Xu
Abstract: Chiral phonons, circularly polarized lattice vibrations carrying intrinsic angular momentum, offer unprecedented opportunities for controlling heat flow, manipulating quantum states through spin-phonon coupling, and realizing exotic transport phenomena. Despite their fundamental importance, a universal framework for identifying and classifying these elusive excitations has remained out of reach. Here, we address this challenge by establishing a comprehensive symmetry-based theory that systematically classifies the helicity and the velocity-angular momentum tensor underlying phonon magnetization in thermal transport across all 230 crystallographic space groups. Our approach, grounded in fundamental representations of phononic angular momentum, reveals three distinct classes of crystals: achiral crystals with vanishing angular momentum, chiral crystals with s-wave helicity, and achiral crystals exhibiting higher-order helicity patterns beyond the s-wave. By performing high-throughput computations and symmetry analysis of the dynamical matrices for 11614 crystalline compounds, we identified 2738 materials exhibiting chiral phonon modes and shortlisted the 170 most promising candidates for future experimental investigation. These results are compiled into an open-access Chiral Phonon Materials Database website, enabling rapid screening for materials with desired chiral phonon properties. Our theoretical framework transcends phonons--it provides a universal paradigm for classifying chiral excitations in crystalline lattices, from magnons to electronic quasiparticles.

Title: Compact representation and long-time extrapolation of real-time data for quantum systems
Authors: Andre Erpenbeck, Yuanran Zhu, Yang Yu, Lei Zhang, Richard Gerum, Olga Goulko, Chao Yang, Guy Cohen, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: Representing real-time data as a sum of complex exponentials provides a compact form that enables both denoising and extrapolation. As a fully data-driven method, the Estimation of Signal Parameters via Rotational Invariance Techniques (ESPRIT) algorithm is agnostic to the underlying physical equations, making it broadly applicable to various observables and experimental or numerical setups. In this work, we consider applications of the ESPRIT algorithm primarily to extend real-time dynamical data from simulations of quantum systems. We evaluate ESPRIT's performance in the presence of noise and compare it to other extrapolation methods. We demonstrate its ability to extract information from short-time dynamics to reliably predict long-time behavior and determine the minimum time interval required for accurate results. We discuss how this insight can be leveraged in numerical methods that propagate quantum systems in time, and show how ESPRIT can predict infinite-time values of dynamical observables, offering a purely data-driven approach to characterizing quantum phases.

Title: A case study: the savings potential thanks to FAIR data in one Materials Science PhD project
Authors: Michael Seitz, Nick Garabedian, Ilia Bagov, Christian Greiner
Abstract: The FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) data principles have gained significant attention as a means to enhance data sharing, collaboration, and reuse across various domains. Here, we explore the potential benefits of implementing FAIR data practices within engineering projects, with a monetary focus in the German context, but by considering aspects which are relatively universal. By examining the FAIR-data aspect of a Materials Science and Engineering PhD project, it becomes evident that substantial cost savings can be achieved. The estimated savings are 2,600 Euros per year from the PhD project considered. This study underscores the importance of implementing FAIR data practices in engineering projects and highlights some significant economic benefits that can be derived from such initiatives. By embracing FAIR principles, organizations in the engineering sector can unlock the full potential of their data, optimize resource allocation, and drive innovation in a cost-effective manner.

Title: Universal Spreading of Nonstabilizerness and Quantum Transport
Authors: Emanuele Tirrito, Poetri Sonya Tarabunga, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte, Piotr Sierant, Xhek Turkeshi
Abstract: We investigate how transport properties of $U(1)$-conserving dynamics impact the growth of quantum resources characterizing the complexity of many-body states. We quantify wave-function delocalization using participation entropy (PE), a measure rooted in the coherence theory of pure states, and assess nonstabilizerness through stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). Focusing on the XXZ spin chain initialized in domain-wall state, we demonstrate universal power-law growth of both PE and SRE, with scaling exponents explicitly reflecting the underlying transport regimes, ballistic, diffusive, or KPZ-type superdiffusive. Our results establish a solid connection between quantum resources and transport, providing insights into the dynamics of complexity within symmetry-constrained quantum systems.

Title: Adiabatic echo protocols for robust quantum many-body state preparation
Authors: Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Adam M. Kaufman, Hannes Pichler
Abstract: Entangled many-body states are a key resource for quantum technologies. Yet their preparation through analog control of interacting quantum systems is often hindered by experimental imperfections. Here, we introduce the adiabatic echo protocol, a general approach to state preparation designed to suppress the effect of static perturbations. We provide an analytical understanding of its robustness in terms of dynamically engineered destructive interference. By applying quantum optimal control methods, we demonstrate that such a protocol emerges naturally in a variety of settings, without requiring assumptions on the form of the control fields. Examples include Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger state preparation in Ising spin chains and two-dimensional Rydberg atom arrays, as well as the generation of quantum spin liquid states in frustrated Rydberg lattices. Our results highlight the broad applicability of this protocol, providing a practical framework for reliable many-body state preparation in present-day quantum platforms.

Title: Thermal state preparation by repeated interactions at and beyond the Lindblad limit
Authors: Carlos Ramon-Escandell, Alessandro Prositto, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We study the nature of thermalization dynamics and the associated preparation (simulation) time under the repeated interaction protocol uncovering a generic anomalous, Mpemba-like trend. As a case study, we focus on a three-level system and analyze its dynamics in two complementary regimes, where the system-ancilla interaction strength is either large or small. Focusing on the estimation of the simulation time, we derive closed-form expressions for the minimum number of collisions, or minimal simulation time, required to achieve a thermal state, which is within $\epsilon$ distance to the target thermal state. At zero temperature, we analytically identify a set of points (interaction strength $\times$ their duration) that minimize the simulation time. At nonzero temperature, we observe a Mpemba-like effect: Starting from a maximally mixed state, thermalization to an intermediate-temperature state takes longer than to a lower-temperature one. We provide an accurate analytical approximation for this phenomenon and demonstrate its occurrence in larger systems and under randomized interaction strengths. The prevalence of the Mpemba effect in thermal state preparation presents a significant challenge for preparing states in large systems, an open problem calling for new strategies.

Title: The Three-Dimensional Velocity Field of Kinesin-Driven Microtubules in Torroidal Channels
Authors: Yi Fan, Kenneth Breuer
Abstract: We study two regimes of flow in multiple three-dimensional toroidal channels by tracking the fluorescent spherical particles in the kinesin-driven microtubule systems: ``chaotic'' flow and ``coherent'' flow. In the smallest aspect ratio torus, where the channel height $h$ is a quarter of the width $w$, the active system shows zero mean velocity, small-scale isotropy in fluctuation and no persistent flow structure. In other tori with higher aspect ratios $h/w$ close to 1, we find faster coherent flows along the azimuthal direction and increasing fluctuation strengths with growing confinement geometries. Regardless of flow regimes, the flow profiles at $r-z$ cross-section and $r-\theta$ plane are symmetric. The ``coherent'' profiles show two criteria: ``Poiseuille-like'' profiles, which have the peak velocities near the centers of channels; a ``peak-separated'' profile, which has four peak velocities near a certain distance to four confining surfaces. These flow profiles, after scaled by the local isotropic fluctuation strength, reveal universal three-dimensional flow structures among the ``Poiseuille-like'' criterion and the same level of scaled peak velocity at the ``peak-separated'' one. These results illustrate scalable flow structures in this kinesin-driven microtubule active system.

Title: Fluid-induced snap-through instability of spherical shells
Authors: Pier Giuseppe Ledda, Hemanshul Garg, Vitus Østergaard-Clausen, Lucas Krumenacker Rudzki, Ahmad Madary, Matteo Pezzulla
Abstract: From the flutter of aircraft wings to an umbrella flipping inside out in the wind, fluid-induced elastic instabilities are a major concern in aeroelastic design. However, Nature often harnesses these instabilities to achieve new functionalities, such as the mechanical snap-through of the Venus flytrap. Inspired by this, engineers and physicists have increasingly exploited elastic instabilities to enable rapid shape changes in metamaterials and soft robots, provided the structure remains elastic throughout the transition. Here, we study the fluid-induced snapping instability of a spherical elastic shell at low Reynolds numbers, the umbrella flipping problem when life is at low Reynolds numbers. We combine precision desktop-scale experiments, fluid-structure simulations, shell theory, fluid mechanics, and scaling analysis to determine the instability threshold as a function of the geometrical and material parameters of the system. Building on these findings, we devise a snapping-based valve that passively and abruptly alters the hydraulic resistance of a channel, offering robust flow control without active components. These valves could be deployed in soft robotics and, because our results are expressed in terms of key dimensionless parameters, we speculate that the system can be miniaturized for use in microfluidic circuits. Beyond the application, our study presents what we believe to be a prototypical example of fluid-induced elastic instability at low Reynolds numbers, providing a foundation for future explorations in soft hydraulics and flow-responsive structures.

Title: Dynamical non-Hermitian systems: Fingerprints and pure dephasing induced protection effect
Authors: Wanchen Ma, Hao Zhang, Junjie Liu
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems have shown promising potential for realizing quantum information tasks that lack counterparts in the Hermitian realm. Understanding the dynamical characteristics of non-Hermitian systems as reflected in information-theoretic quantities is essential for advancing their applications. Here we investigate dynamics of trace distance and concurrence, which quantify information flow and entanglement, respectively, in non-Hermitian qubit systems exhibiting either parity-time or anti-parity-time symmetry. We identify dynamical fingerprints from the system density matrix which provide a unified explanation to the common oscillation and relaxation dynamics shared by trace distance and concurrence observed in existing studies. We further investigate the fate of dynamical fingerprints under the impact of pure dephasing. Surprisingly, we find that pure dephasing can slow down the inherent relaxation of information flow and entanglement in non-Hermitian systems with unbroken anti-parity-time symmetry, suggesting a passive environment-assisted information protection in this class of non-Hermitian systems. Our findings enhance our understanding of dynamical non-Hermitian systems and have specific relevance to their information-oriented applications.

Title: Simulating the Antiferromagnetic Heisenberg Model on a Spin-Frustrated Kagome Lattice with the Contextual Subspace Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Tim Weaving, Alexis Ralli, Vinul Wimalaweera, Peter J. Love, Peter V. Coveney
Abstract: In this work we investigate the ground state properties of a candidate quantum spin liquid using a superconducting Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) device. Specifically, we study the antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a Kagome lattice, a geometrically frustrated structure that gives rise to a highly degenerate energy spectrum. To successfully simulate this system, we employ a qubit reduction strategy leveraging the Contextual Subspace methodology, significantly reducing the problem size prior to execution on the quantum device. We improve the quality of these subspaces by using the wavefunctions obtained from low bond dimension Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) calculations to bias the subspace stabilizers through a symplectic approximate symmetry generator extraction algorithm. Reducing the Hamiltonian size allows us to implement tiled circuit ensembles and deploy the Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) to estimate the ground state energy. We adopt a hybrid quantum error mitigation strategy combining Readout Error Mitigation (REM), Symmetry Verification (SV) and Zero Noise Extrapolation (ZNE). This approach yields high-accuracy energy estimates, achieving error rates on the order of 0.01% and thus demonstrating the potential of near-term quantum devices for probing frustrated quantum materials.

Title: Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics
Authors: Abolfazl Ramezanpour
Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the performance of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to find a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This approach also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Title: Prediction of the aqueous redox properties of functionalized quinones using a new QM/MM variational formulation
Authors: Maxime Labat, Guillaume Jeanmairet, Emmanuel Giner
Abstract: We recently proposed a method coupling quantum mechanics (QM) methods and molecular density functional theory (MDFT) to describe mixed quantum-classical systems [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 014113 (2024)]. This approach is particularly appropriate to account for solvent effect into QM calculations. We introduce a new variational formulation for the grand potential of a mixed quantum-classical system. Within the Born-Oppenheimer approximation and neglecting electronic entropy, the quantum solute is described by a product of electronic and nuclear density matrices, both depending parametrically on coordinates of the classical solvent. It can then be shown that a functional of the total density matrix satisfies a variational principle for the grand potential. Using a mean-field approximation, we express the grand potential of the mixed quantum-classical system as a variational problem which depends only on the nuclear density matrix, which experiences an external field generated by the electronic and classical one-particle densities. In practice, the grand potential is computed by a series of coupled classical and quantum DFT calculations, together with geometry optimization.

Title: On the existence of consistent adversarial attacks in high-dimensional linear classification
Authors: Matteo Vilucchio, Lenka Zdeborová, Bruno Loureiro
Abstract: What fundamentally distinguishes an adversarial attack from a misclassification due to limited model expressivity or finite data? In this work, we investigate this question in the setting of high-dimensional binary classification, where statistical effects due to limited data availability play a central role. We introduce a new error metric that precisely capture this distinction, quantifying model vulnerability to consistent adversarial attacks -- perturbations that preserve the ground-truth labels. Our main technical contribution is an exact and rigorous asymptotic characterization of these metrics in both well-specified models and latent space models, revealing different vulnerability patterns compared to standard robust error measures. The theoretical results demonstrate that as models become more overparameterized, their vulnerability to label-preserving perturbations grows, offering theoretical insight into the mechanisms underlying model sensitivity to adversarial attacks.

Title: Magnetic properties of the frustrated decorated Ising chain
Authors: D.V. Laptiev, O.O. Krivchikov, Yu.V. Savin, V.V. Slavin
Abstract: Using the Kramers-Wannier transfer matrix method we studied several decorated Ising chains. The exact expressions for thermodynamic characteristics, including the ground state characteristics, were obtained. We considered a number of modeling chains with different signs and absolute values of exchange constants for the nearest- and the next-nearest neighbors. For these models we calculated the magnetization curves. The critical values of magnetic fields and corresponding magnetization plateau parameters were obtained. Analytic expressions for the ground state entropy were obtained for the chains with different interaction constants. The dependencies of the number of states with minimum energy (the degeneration of the ground state) as the function of the number of particles were found. It was shown that these dependencies are expressed in terms of well-known numerical sequences - Lucas numbers and Pell numbers, which, in the limit of a large number of particles, are proportional to the powers of the golden and silver sections. Therefore, the ground state entropy (per particle) of the systems under consideration can be described in terms of these sections and, therefore, is nonzero.

Title: Emission Properties of a Hybrid Metallized Diamond(001) Photocathode
Authors: Louis A. Angeloni, Ir-Jene Shan, W. Andreas Schroeder
Abstract: The spectral emission characteristics of a proof-of-concept hybrid metallized diamond(001) photocathode are presented. The quantum efficiency (QE) is shown to be determined by the photo-injection efficiency across the ohmic contact at the back metallized face, whereas the mean transverse energy (MTE) of the photoemitted electrons is consistent with a (optical)phonon-assisted and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon mechanism [Phys. Rev. Applied 23, 054065 (2025)] following electron drift transport to the untreated diamond(001) front emission face. Emission is observed from both the lower and upper conduction bands of diamond with positive and negative electron affinity respectively. A potential route to the realization of a red-visible photocathode based on this concept with a sub-50meV MTE and a QE greater than 0.1% is discussed.

Title: Iterative Annealing Mechanism for Protein and RNA Chaperones
Authors: Changbong Hyeon, D. Thirumalai
Abstract: Molecular chaperones are machines that consume copious amount of ATP to drive misfolded proteins or RNA to fold into functionally competent native states. Because the folding landscapes of biomolecules with complex native state topology are rugged consisting of multiple minima that are separated by large free energy barriers, folding occurs by the kinetic partitioning mechanism according to which only a small fraction of the molecules reach the folded state in biologically viable times. The rescue of such proteins and RNA require chaperones. Although the protein and RNA chaperones are profoundly different in their structure and action, the principles underlying their activity to produce the folded structures can be understood using a unified theoretical framework based on iterative annealing mechanism (IAM). Our theory shows that both these machines have evolved to the maximize the production of the steady state yield on biological times. Strikingly, theory predicts that only at a moderate level of RNA chaperone activity is the yield of the self-splicing pre-RNA is maximized in \textit{in vivo}.

Title: Beyond Dicke superradiance: Universal scaling of the peak emission rate
Authors: Raphael Holzinger, Susanne F. Yelin
Abstract: In quantum optics, superradiance is a phenomenon in which a system of $N$ fully excited quantum emitters radiate intense flashes of light during collective decay. However, computing its peak intensity for many spatially separated emitters remained challenging due to the exponential growth of the underlying Hilbert space with system size $N$. Derived from exact numerics, we present an analytically compact and easily computable formula for the peak photon emission rate of fully excited quantum emitter systems undergoing superradiant decay. The result applies to emitter configurations in any geometry and reveals a universal behavior: spatially extended quantum systems have a geometry-dependent optimal emitter number and always reach a peak photon emission rate that increases only linearly with $N$. Our results encompass quantum systems ranging from cold atomic gases and neutral-atom arrays to molecular aggregates and solid-state materials.

Title: Tunable plasmon modes and topological transitions in single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials
Authors: Debasmita Giri, John Schliemann, Rafael Molina, Alexander Lopez
Abstract: We investigate the plasmonic response of single- and bilayer semi-Dirac materials under the influence of a tunable parameter $\delta$ that governs topological transitions via Dirac cone generation/merging and incorporating band inversion terms. For single-layer systems, we demonstrate that the emergence of Dirac cones leads to an enhanced plasmon frequency range and that the plasmonic spectrum exhibits strong anisotropy, especially for finite $\delta$ and vanishing inversion terms. In the bilayer configurations, we uncover a second plasmon mode whose relative phase, with respect to the first mode, can be actively controlled by rotating the upper layer which impacts the symmetry of the charge oscillations across the layers. This tunability enables switching between in- and out-of-phase plasmonic modes, offering a route toward phase-controlled collective excitations. Our results highlight the potential of semi-Dirac systems for topological plasmonics and interferometric applications in next-generation optoelectronic devices.

Title: Ion Track Formation via Electric-Field-Enhanced Energy Deposition
Authors: Zikang Ge, Jinhao Hu, Shengyuan Peng, Wei Kang, Xiaofei Shen, Yanbo Xie, Jianming Xue
Abstract: High-energy ion irradiation deposits extreme energy in a narrow range (1-10 nm) along ion trajectories in solid through electronic energy loss, producing unique irradiation effects such as ion tracks. However, intrinsic velocity effects impose an upper limit on electronic energy loss that cannot be overcome by adjusting irradiation parameters. We introduce a method using electric fields during irradiation to enhance nanoscale energy deposition by accelerating ion-excited electrons within sub-picosecond this http URL extended thermal spike model quantitatively describes this enhancement and predicts a significant reduction in the electronic energy loss required for ion track formation in amorphous SiO2, which is in excellent agreement with experimental observations. This work provides a new approach to control energy deposition during irradiation and boosts the wide application of ion tracks in material modification and nanoengineering to much broader extents.

Title: Noise resilience of deterministic analog combinatorial optimization solvers
Authors: Clemens Gneiting, Farad Khoyratee, Enrico Rinaldi, Khyati Jain, Rishab Khincha, Franco Nori
Abstract: Several continuous dynamical systems have recently been proposed as special-purpose analog computers designed to solve combinatorial optimization problems such as $k$-SAT or the Ising problem. While combinatorial optimization problems are known to be NP-hard, and thus scale, in the worst case, exponentially with the problem size, these analog solvers promise substantial speed-up and scaling advantages in finding the solution. The underlying algorithms, which can be cast in the form of differential equations, generically involve highly chaotic dynamics and thus assume that the system variables can be processed with, in principle, arbitrary precision. However, both actual physical systems as well as finite digital machines, which are used to virtually emulate the dynamics, can process the evolution only with finite precision, be it because of intrinsic noise or because of limited precision in number representation. We investigate the impact of such noise on the solution-finding capability. To this end, we focus on two representative analog solvers, designed to address the Ising problem and the $k$-SAT problem, respectively. Our numerical analysis reveals that the ability of these algorithms to find solutions exhibits a threshold behavior under the addition of noise, where the solution-finding capability remains mostly uncompromised below a noise threshold, while it rapidly deteriorates above the threshold. As we show, these noise tolerance thresholds decrease with the problem size, following an approximate algebraic scaling. This allows us to infer principal limits on the problem sizes that can be efficiently tackled with these solvers under given noise levels.

Title: Multi-parameter isospectral Fokker-Planck equations
Authors: Choon-Lin Ho
Abstract: From a given Fokker-Planck equation, a multi-parameter deformed partner Fokker-Planck equation is constructed. This is done by first deleting a set of eigenstates of the original FPE by the multi-step Darboux-Crum transformation, and then reinstating the eigen-energy levels by the reverse Darboux-Crum transformation. Extension to fractional Fokker-Planck equation is briefly discussed. A recent study of the one-parameter isospectral FPE applied to black hole in the thermal potential approach is commented.

Title: Stress-Testing Multimodal Foundation Models for Crystallographic Reasoning
Authors: Can Polat, Hasan Kurban, Erchin Serpedin, Mustafa Kurban
Abstract: Evaluating foundation models for crystallographic reasoning requires benchmarks that isolate generalization behavior while enforcing physical constraints. This work introduces a multiscale multicrystal dataset with two physically grounded evaluation protocols to stress-test multimodal generative models. The Spatial-Exclusion benchmark withholds all supercells of a given radius from a diverse dataset, enabling controlled assessments of spatial interpolation and extrapolation. The Compositional-Exclusion benchmark omits all samples of a specific chemical composition, probing generalization across stoichiometries. Nine vision--language foundation models are prompted with crystallographic images and textual context to generate structural annotations. Responses are evaluated via (i) relative errors in lattice parameters and density, (ii) a physics-consistency index penalizing volumetric violations, and (iii) a hallucination score capturing geometric outliers and invalid space-group predictions. These benchmarks establish a reproducible, physically informed framework for assessing generalization, consistency, and reliability in large-scale multimodal models. Dataset and code are available at this https URL.

Abstract: This work presents an approach to the inverse design of scattering systems by modifying the transmission matrix using reinforcement learning. We utilize Proximal Policy Optimization to navigate the highly non-convex landscape of the object function to achieve three types of transmission matrices: (1) Fixed-ratio power conversion and zero-transmission mode in rank-1 matrices, (2) exceptional points with degenerate eigenvalues and unidirectional mode conversion, and (3) uniform channel participation is enforced when transmission eigenvalues are degenerate.

Title: Hopfield Networks as Models of Emergent Function in Biology
Authors: Maria Yampolskaya, Pankaj Mehta
Abstract: Hopfield models, originally developed to study memory retrieval in neural networks, have become versatile tools for modeling diverse biological systems in which function emerges from collective dynamics. In this review, we provide a pedagogical introduction to both classical and modern Hopfield networks from a biophysical perspective. After presenting the underlying mathematics, we build physical intuition through three complementary interpretations of Hopfield dynamics: as noise discrimination, as a geometric construction defining a natural coordinate system in pattern space, and as gradient-like descent on an energy landscape. We then survey recent applications of Hopfield networks a variety of biological setting including cellular differentiation and epigenetic memory, molecular self-assembly, and spatial neural representations.

Title: Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus
Authors: Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Title: Scalable Simulation of Quantum Many-Body Dynamics with Or-Represented Quantum Algebra
Authors: Lukas Broers, Rong-Yang Sun, Seiji Yunoki
Abstract: High-performance numerical methods are essential not only for advancing quantum many-body physics but also for enabling integration with emerging quantum computing platforms. We present a scalable and general-purpose parallel algorithm for quantum simulations based on or-represented quantum algebra (ORQA). This framework applies to arbitrary spin systems and naturally integrates with quantum circuit simulation in the Heisenberg picture, particularly relevant to recent large-scale experiments on superconducting qubit processors [Kim et al., Nature 618, 500 (2023)]. As a benchmark, we simulate the kicked Ising model on a 127-qubit heavy-hexagon lattice, tracking the time evolution of local magnetization using up to one trillion Pauli strings. Executed on the supercomputer Fugaku, our simulations exhibit strong scaling up to $2^{17}$ parallel processes with near-linear communication overhead. These results establish ORQA as a practical and high-performance tool for quantum many-body dynamics, and highlight its potential for integration into hybrid quantum-classical computational frameworks, complementing recent advances in tensor-network and surrogate simulation techniques.

Title: Emergence of an Epsilon-Near-Zero Medium from Microscopic Atomic Principles
Authors: L. Ruks, J. Ruostekoski
Abstract: We demonstrate that an effective near-zero refractive index can emerge from collective light scattering in a discrete atomic lattice, using essentially exact microscopic simulations. In a 25-layer array, cooperative response leads to over a thirtyfold increase in the effective optical wavelength within the medium, almost eliminating optical phase accumulation, with potential applications in spectroscopy and optical manipulation of quantum emitters. Crucially, the near-zero refractive index arises from first-principles microscopic theory, rather than being imposed through continuous phenomenological effective-medium model - providing conceptually important insight into the emergence of macroscopic electromagnetism from atomic-scale interactions.

Title: Quantum thermalization mechanism and the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases
Authors: Sebastián Gómez, Ángel L. Corps, Armando Relaño
Abstract: We propose a generalization of the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis accounting for the emergence of symmetry-breaking phases. It consists of two conditions that any system with a degenerate spectrum must fulfill in order to thermalize. The failure of each of them generates a different non-thermalizing scenario. One is due to the absence of chaos and may indicate that extra constants of motion are required to describe equilibrium states. The other one implies the existence of initial conditions evolving towards symmetry-breaking equilibrium states. If it spreads across an entire spectral region, then this region gives rise to a symmetry-breaking phase. We explore the applicability of this formalism by means of numerical experiments on a three-site Bose-Hubbard model with two non-commuting discrete symmetries.

Authors: Akke Mats Houben
Abstract: Coupled evolution equations for the amplitudes of heterogeneous states (memories) stored in the connectivity of distributed systems with distance-constrained non-local interactions are derived. The resulting system of coupled amplitude equations describes the spatio-temporal dynamics of the pattern amplitudes. It is shown that these types of distributed systems perform pattern completion and selection, and that the distance restricted connections afford spatio-temporal memory pattern dynamics taking the form of patterning fronts.

Title: High-fidelity entanglement and coherent multi-qubit mapping in an atom array
Authors: Aruku Senoo, Alexander Baumgärtner, Joanna W. Lis, Gaurav M. Vaidya, Zhongda Zeng, Giuliano Giudici, Hannes Pichler, Adam M. Kaufman
Abstract: Neutral atoms in optical tweezer arrays possess broad applicability for quantum information science, in computing, simulation, and metrology. Among atomic species, Ytterbium-171 is unique as it hosts multiple qubits, each of which is impactful for these distinct applications. Consequently, this atom is an ideal candidate to bridge multiple disciplines, which, more broadly, has been an increasingly effective strategy within the field of quantum science. Realizing the full potential of this synergy requires high-fidelity generation and transfer of many-particle entanglement between these distinct qubit degrees of freedom, and thus between these distinct applications. Here we demonstrate the creation and coherent mapping of entangled quantum states across multiple qubits in Ytterbium-171 tweezer arrays. We map entangled states onto the optical clock qubit from the nuclear spin qubit or the Rydberg qubit. We coherently transfer up to 20 atoms of a $Z_2$-ordered Greenberger-Horne-Zeilinger (GHZ) state from the interacting Rydberg manifold to the metastable nuclear spin manifold. The many-body state is generated via a novel disorder-robust pulse in a two-dimensional ladder geometry. We further find that clock-qubit-based spin detection applied to Rydberg and nuclear spin qubits facilitates atom-loss-detectable qubit measurements and $>90\%$ Rydberg decay detection. This enables mid-circuit and delayed erasure detection, yielding an error-detected two-qubit gate fidelity of $99.78(4)\%$ in the metastable qubits as well as enhanced GHZ state fidelities in analog preparation. These results establish a versatile architecture that advances multiple fields of quantum information science while also establishing bridges between them.

Title: Purely quantum memory in closed systems observed via imperfect measurements
Authors: Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: The detection and quantification of non-Markovianity, a.k.a. memory, in quantum systems is a central problem in the theory of open quantum systems. There memory is as a result of the interaction between the system and its environment. Little is known, however, about memory effects induced by imperfect measurements on closed systems, where an entanglement with the environment is not possible. We investigate the emergence and characteristics of memory in closed systems observed via imperfect stroboscopic quantum measurements yielding coarse-grained outcomes. We consider ideal and two kinds of imperfect measurements: von Neumann measurements--the analogue of classical lumping--which destroy any coherence in the system, and genuinely quantum-lumping Lüders measurements preserving certain quantum correlations. Whereas the conditions for Markov dynamics under von Neumann lumping are the same as for classical dynamics, quantum-lumping requires stronger conditions, i.e. the absence of any detectable coherence. We introduce the concept of purely quantum memory having no classical counterpart. We illustrate our results with a quantum walk on a lattice and discuss their implications for dissipative dynamics and decoherence effects induced by more realistic measurements.

Title: Shaping Bulk Fermi Arcs in the Momentum Space of Photonic Crystal Slabs
Authors: Luigi Frau, Simone Zanotti, Lydie Ferrier, Dario Gerace, Hai Son Nguyen
Abstract: Exceptional points (EPs) are special spectral degeneracies of non-Hermitian operators: at the EP, the complex eigenvalues coalesce, i.e., they become degenerate in both their real and imaginary parts. In two-dimensional (2D) photonic crystal lattices, these elements can be tailored through structural engineering. In particular, it is known that a quadratic degeneracy in the photonic band structure can be split into a pair of Dirac points (DPs) by breaking one of the unit cell symmetries, and each DP can be further split into a pair of EPs by introducing losses. Each EP of the pair is then connected by an open isofrequency curve, called the bulk Fermi arc (BFA). In this work, we introduce a simplified effective Hamiltonian model accounting for the main physical properties of these EPs and BFAs. Then, we systematically investigate, through numerical simulations, how EPs as well as the related BFA depend on the type and amount of broken symmetries in the given 2D unit cell of a realistic photonic crystal slab implementation. Our results show that it is possible to tailor the position and distance of the EP pair in reciprocal space, as well as the curvature and orientation of the associated BFA, by deterministically tuning the unit cell structure. Importantly, the symmetry-breaking strategy we propose is general and can be applied to a broad range of photonic crystal designs beyond the specific example studied here. This approach opens new possibilities for exploiting EPs in applications involving photonic crystal lattices in, e.g., light-emitting devices or fundamental physics studies.

Title: Direct visualization of visible-light hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in real space and time
Authors: Atreyie Ghosh, Calvin Raab, Joseph L. Spellberg, Aishani Mohan, Sarah B. King
Abstract: Hyperbolic materials support exotic polaritons with hyperbolic dispersion that enable subdiffraction focusing and enhanced light-matter interactions. Visible-frequency hyperbolic plasmon polaritons (HPPs) offer significant advantages over hyperbolic phonon polaritons, which operate in the infrared frequency range - namely lower losses and greater technological relevance. However, these HPPs remained experimentally inaccessible until the recent identification of molybdenum(IV) oxychloride (MoOCl$_2$). Here we achieve the first direct real-space and real-time visualization of hyperbolic plasmon polaritons in natural materials using time-resolved photoemission electron microscopy with femtosecond time resolution and nanometer spatial resolution. Our direct imaging enables measurement of HPP propagation velocities and lengths, real-time observation of plasmon-material edge interactions, experimental validation of hyperbolic dispersion through polarization-dependent experiments, and direct visualization of hyperbolic focusing phenomena. This spatiotemporal visualization validates theoretical predictions while establishing an experimental foundation for exploiting these unusual light-matter states in fundamental studies of hyperbolic media and nanophotonics.

Title: Engineering many-body quantum Hamiltonians with non-ergodic properties using quantum Monte Carlo
Authors: Nyayabanta Swain, Ho-Kin Tang, Darryl Chuan Wei Foo, Brian J. J. Khor, Gabriel Lemarié, Fakher F. Assaad, Pinaki Sengupta, Shaffique Adam
Abstract: We present a computational framework to identify Hamiltonians of interacting quantum many-body systems that host non-ergodic excited states. We combine quantum Monte Carlo simulations with the recently proposed eigenstate-to-Hamiltonian construction, which maps the ground state of a specified parent Hamiltonian to a single non-ergodic excited state of a new derived Hamiltonian. This engineered Hamiltonian contains non-trivial, systematically-obtained, and emergent features that are responsible for its non-ergodic properties. We demonstrate this approach by applying it to quantum many-body scar states where we discover a previously unreported family of Hamiltonians with spatially oscillating spin exchange couplings that host scar-like properties, including revivals in the quantum dynamics, and towers in the inverse participation ratio; and to many-body localization, where we find a two-dimensional Hamiltonian with correlated disorder that exhibits non-ergodic scaling of the participation entropy and inverse participation ratios of order unity. The method can be applied to other known ground states to discover new quantum many-body systems with non-ergodic excited states.

Title: Nature of Spinons in 1D Spin Chains
Authors: Teresa Kulka, Milosz Panfil, Mona Berciu, Krzysztof Wohlfeld
Abstract: We provide an intuitive understanding of the collective low-energy spin excitation of the one-dimensional spin-1/2 antiferromagnetic Heisenberg chain, known as the spinon. To this end, we demonstrate how a single spinon can be excited by adding one extra spin to the ground state. This procedure accurately reproduces all key features of the spinon's dispersion. These follow from the vanishing norm of the excited state which is triggered by the ground state entanglement. Next, we show that the spinon dispersion can be approximately reproduced if we replace the true ground state with the simplest valence-bond solid. This proves that the spinon of the one-dimensional Heisenberg model can be understood as a single spin flowing through a valence-bond solid.

Title: On data and dimension in chemistry -- irreversibility, concealment and emergent conservation laws
Authors: Alex Blokhuis, Martijn van Kuppeveld, Daan van de Weem, Robert Pollice
Abstract: Chemical systems are interpreted through the species they contain and the reactions they may undergo, i.e., their chemical reaction network (CRN). In spite of their central importance to chemistry, the structure of CRNs continues to be challenging to deduce from data. Although there exist structural laws relating species, reactions, conserved quantities and cycles, there has been limited attention to their measurable consequences. One such is the dimension of the chemical data: the number of independent reactions or equivalently independent species, which corresponds to the number of measured variables minus the number of constraints. In this paper we attempt to relate the experimentally observed dimensional features to conservation laws and underlying CRN structure. Our approach extends to any Markov model as well as many nonlinear models in statistical physics and furnishes new analytical tools to find exact solutions. In particular, we investigate the effects of species that are concealed and reactions that are irreversible. For instance, irreversible reactions can have proportional rates. The resulting reduction in degrees of freedom can be captured by the co-production law relating co-production relationships to emergent non-integer conservation laws and broken cycles. This law resolves a recent conundrum posed by a machine-discovered candidate for a non-integer conservation law, and characterizes certain types of CRN behavior. We also obtain laws that allow us to relate data dimension to network structure in cases where some species cannot be discerned or distinguished by a given analytical technique, allowing to narrow down candidate CRNs from experimental data more effectively.

Title: Localization with non-Hermitian off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Aitijhya Saha, Debraj Rakshit
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a non-Hermitian system described via a one-dimensional single-particle tight-binding model, where the non-Hermiticity is governed by random nearest-neighbour tunnellings, such that the left-to-right and right-to-left hopping strengths are unequal. A physical situation of completely real eigenspectrum arises owing to the Hamiltonian's tridiagonal matrix structure under a simple sign conservation of the product of the conjugate nearest-neighbour tunnelling terms. The off-diagonal disorder leads the non-Hermitian system to a delocalization-localization crossover in finite systems. The emergent nature of the crossover is recognized through a finite-size spectral analysis. The system enters into a localized phase for infinitesimal disorder strength in the thermodynamic limit. We perform a careful scaling analysis of localization length, inverse participation ratio (IPR), and energy splitting and report the corresponding scaling exponents. Noticeably, in contrast to the diagonal disorder, the density of states (DOS) has a singularity at E=0 in the presence of the off-diagonal disorder and the corresponding wavefunction remains delocalized for any given disorder strength.

Authors: Takahiro Uto, Daigo Oue
Abstract: We study parametric instability in a magnomechanical system, specifically examining magnon tunneling between moving ferromagnetic insulators. Our analysis reveals that quantum fluctuations generate spin currents above a critical velocity threshold, while no spin currents occur below this threshold at low temperatures. The critical velocity depends on magnon stiffness and Zeeman energy. Approaching the threshold, the spin current becomes divergent, linked to the $PT$-symmetry-breaking transition. This enhanced behavior could offer high-sensitivity measurements and efficient spin current generation in magnon-based quantum technology.

Title: Distinguishable-particle Glassy Crystal: the simplest molecular model of glass
Authors: Leo S.I. Lam, Gautham Gopinath, Zichen Zhao, Shuling Wang, Chun-Shing Lee, Hai-Yao Deng, Feng Wang, Yilong Han, Cho-Tung Yip, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: The nature of glassy dynamics and the glass transition are long-standing problems under active debate. In the presence of a structural disorder widely believed to be an essential characteristic of structural glass, identifying and understanding key dynamical behaviors are very challenging. In this work, we demonstrate that an energetic disorder, which usually results from a structural disorder, is instead a more essential feature of glass. Specifically, we develop a distinguishable-particle glassy crystal (DPGC) in which particles are ordered in a face-centered cubic lattice and follow particle-dependent random interactions, leading to an energetic disorder in the particle configuration space. Molecular dynamics simulations in the presence of vacancy-induced particle diffusion show typical glassy behaviors. A unique feature of this molecular model is the knowledge of the complete set of inherent structures with easily calculable free energies, implying a well-understood potential energy landscape.

Title: Exploring the Strongly-Interacting Regime of Effective Multi-Body Interactions in a Trapped Ultracold Atom System
Authors: Kantaro Honda, Yosuke Takasu, Yuki Haruna, Yusuke Nishida, Yoshiro Takahashi
Abstract: A two-body interaction or force between quantum particles is ubiquitous in nature, and the microscopic description in terms of the bare two-body interaction is the basis for quantitatively describing interacting few- and many-body systems. Alternatively, the effective description in terms of an effective two-body interaction successfully captures the essence of the systems. However, for several important observations, the explanation in terms of an effective two-body interaction is not satisfactory, and the effective three-body interaction has played an essential role in understanding the systems. In this study, we investigate a few-body system comprising of ultracold bosons tightly confined in a deep optical lattice site, which is effectively described as zero-dimensional bosons. By combining an occupancy-resolving high-resolution laser spectroscopy with an inter-orbital Feshbach resonance controlling the bare two-body interaction over a wide range, we experimentally reveal the behaviors of few-atom systems in a strongly interacting regime. Our results, for which perturbative calculations do not provide proper explanations, serve as a valuable and precise benchmark for theoretical approaches to strongly interacting few-body systems. As one important illustration, we obtain a clear signature of an effective four-body interaction evidenced by the binding energies of four and more atoms. This work is an important step for our deeper understanding of strongly interacting few-body systems.

Title: Flat or crumpled: states of active symmetric membranes
Authors: Sudip Mukherjee, Abhik Basu
Abstract: We set up and study the hydrodynamic theory for inversion-symmetric active fluid and tethered membranes. For some choices of the activity parameter, such membranes are stable and described by linear hydrodynamic equations, which are exact in the asymptotic long wavelength limit, giving stable flat phases with translational quasi long range orders. For other choices of the activity parameter, the system is linearly unstable in the long wavelength limit, implying crumpling, or has intermediate wavevector instabilities, suggesting patterns. We argue that in such an active membrane thermal noises dominate over any active noises, and use those to calculate the correlation functions of membrane conformation fluctuations in the stable case, and the associated correlation functions of the embedding bulk flow velocities

Title: Minimal Fractional Topological Insulator in half-filled conjugate moiré Chern bands
Authors: Chao-Ming Jian, Meng Cheng, Cenke Xu
Abstract: We propose a "minimal" fractional topological insulator (mFTI), motivated by the recent experimental report on the signatures of FTI at total filling factor $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ in a transition metal dichalcogenide moiré system. The observed FTI at $\nu_{\rm tot} = 3$ is likely given by a topological state living in a pair of half-filled conjugate Chern bands with Chern numbers $C=\pm 1$ on top of another pair of fully-filled conjugate Chern bands. We propose the mFTI as a strong candidate topological state in the half-filled conjugate Chern bands. The mFTI is characterized by the following features: (1) It is a fully gapped topological order (TO) with 16 Abelian anyons if the electron is considered trivial (32 including electrons); (2) the minimally-charged anyon carries electric charge $e^\ast = e/2$, together with the fractional quantum spin-Hall conductivity, implying the robustness of the mFTI's gapless edge state whenever time-reversal symmetry and charge conversation are present; (3) the mFTI is "minimal" in the sense that it has the smallest total quantum dimension (a metric for the TO's complexity) within all the TOs that can potentially be realized at the same electron filling and with the same Hall transports; the mFTI is also the unique one that respects time-reversal symmetry. (4) the mFTI is the common descendant of multiple valley-decoupled "product TOs" with larger quantum dimensions. It can also be viewed as the result of gauging multiple symmetry-protected topological states. Similar mFTIs can be constructed for a pair of $1/q$-filled conjugate Chern bands. We classify the mFTIs via the stability of the gapless interfaces between them.

Title: Accelerating Discovery of Metal-Insulator Transition Compounds Using Physics-Informed Machine Learning
Authors: Alexandru B. Georgescu, Peiwen Ren, Harshul Bhatt, Christopher Karpovich, Bipasa Samanta, Elsa Olivetti, James M. Rondinelli
Abstract: Metal-insulator transition (MIT) materials are a useful platform for emerging microelectronic, optoelectronic, and neuromorphic devices, but their discovery is hindered by the high computational cost of electronic structure modeling, the complexity of underlying mechanisms, and the challenges of experimental validation. Here, we present a physics-informed machine learning framework that accelerates the discovery of thermally driven MIT materials. Using a trained classifier, we screen a crystal structure database to identify promising candidates for higher fidelity simulations. We focus on Ca$_2$Fe$_3$O$_8$, CaCo$_2$O$_4$, and CaMn$_2$O$_4$, and use density functional theory (DFT) to determine their electronic and magnetic ground states and assess their microscopic MIT mechanisms. We further apply machine learning regression models to estimate their transition temperatures and employ synthesis prediction tools to identify likely precursors and reaction routes. This integrated approach reduces the time and effort required to identify, understand, and synthesize new MIT materials, providing a generalizable pathway for accelerating correlated quantum materials discovery.

Title: Universality of giant diffusion in tilted periodic potentials
Authors: Kento Iida, Andreas Dechant, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: Giant diffusion, where the diffusion coefficient of a Brownian particle in a periodic potential with an external force is significantly enhanced by the external force, is a non-trivial non-equilibrium phenomenon. We propose a simple stochastic model of giant diffusion, which is based on a biased continuous-time random walk (CTRW) with flight time. By introducing a flight time representing traversal dynamics, we derive the diffusion coefficient using renewal theory and demonstrate its universal peak behavior under various periodic potentials, especially in low-temperature regimes. Giant diffusion is universally observed in the sense that there is a peak of the diffusion coefficient for any tilted periodic potentials and the degree of the diffusivity is greatly enhanced especially for low-temperature regimes. The biased CTRW models with flight times are applied to diffusion under three tilted periodic potentials. Furthermore, the temperature dependence of the maximum diffusion coefficient and the external force that attains the maximum are presented for diffusion under a tilted sawtooth potential.

Title: Sensitive parameter dependence of the self-similar dynamics in the bubble breakup in a confined geometry
Authors: Shoko Ii, Ko Okumura
Abstract: Formation of a fluid drop, such as observed in dripping faucet, has been extensively studied for understanding singular dynamics widely observed in nature. The singular dynamics is often self-similar, i.e., the shape at different times are collapsed onto a master curve after rescaling. Here, we investigate the bubble breakup in an original setup, where a metal disk entrains air into viscous fluid with lubricating films on its surfaces in a confined cell, focusing on the dependence of the dynamics on the film thickness e. As a result, we find out the dynamics is self-similar as expected, but the shape of the master curve and the scaling exponents characterizing the self-similar dynamics are revealed to be sensitively dependent on e. We discuss analogy between the present study and critical phenomena in thermodynamic transitions, to suggest a promising future direction of the singular dynamics.

Title: Theoretical study on the possibility of high $T_c$ s$\pm$-wave superconductivity in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates
Authors: Hirofumi Sakakibara, Ryota Mizuno, Masayuki Ochi, Hidetomo Usui, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: We theoretically propose a possibility of realizing high $T_c$ superconductivity having $s\pm$-wave symmetry in the heavily hole-doped infinite layer nickelates La$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$NiO$_2$. We consider situations where the original $P4/mmm$ symmetry of LaNiO$_2$ is maintained even for a significant amount of Sr substitution by growing thin films on substrates having tetragonal symmetry. Considering such cases is indeed justified by our phonon calculations. For electron configurations somewhat close to $d^8$, the interaction between the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ band and the other $3d$ bands that lie just below the Fermi level results in an enhancement of superconductivity where the sign of the gap function is reversed between the former and the latter bands. The strong enhancement of superconductivity can be attributed to the large energy level offset between $d_{x^2-y^2}$ and other orbitals due to the absence of the apical oxygens, as has been pointed out in previous studies.

Title: Nanoscale Domain Wall Dynamics in Micromagnetic Structures with Weak Perpendicular Anisotropy
Authors: Tim A. Butcher, Nicholas W. Phillips, Abraham L. Levitan, Markus Weigand, Sebastian Wintz, Jörg Raabe, Simone Finizio
Abstract: Time-resolved pump-probe soft X-ray ptychography and Scanning Transmission X-ray Microscopy (STXM) were employed to study the magnetic domain wall dynamics in microstructures of permalloy (Ni$_{81}$Fe$_{19}$; Py) with a weak growth-induced perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. The X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) images of a micrometer-sized Py square (160 nm thickness) and an elliptical disk (80 nm thickness) show flux-closure patterns with domain walls that fall into alternating out-of-plane (OOP) magnetization states precipitated by the perpendicular anisotropy, which is a precursor of the nucleation of stripe domains at higher thicknesses. An oscillating magnetic field at frequencies from tens of MHz to GHz and up to 4 mT magnitude excited dynamic modes in the domain walls along with the vortex core gyration. The domain wall dynamics include the translation of inversion points of the OOP magnetization and nucleation of one-dimensional spin waves.

Title: Tracking the variation of entanglement Rényi negativity: a quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Yin Tang, Zhe Wang, Zhiyan Wang, Bin-Bin Mao, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Entanglement entropy has been a powerful tool for analyzing phases and criticality in pure ground states via quantum Monte Carlo (QMC). However, mixed-state entanglement, relevant to systems with dissipation, finite temperature, and disjoint regions, remains less explored due to the lack of efficient numerical methods. In this work, we present a practical and easy-to-implement QMC method within the reweight-annealing framework, enabling efficient computation of the entanglement Rényi negativity (RN) by tracking its variation along given parameter paths. This method is scalable, parallelizable, and well-suited for high-dimensional and large-scale simulations. Applying it to diverse scenarios-including 1D and 2D systems, ground and thermal states, and bipartite and tripartite partitions, not only the information of the underlying conformal field theory is achieved, but the role of entanglement in quantum and thermal phase transitions is revealed.

Title: Active nematic response to a deformable body or boundary: elastic deformations and anchoring-induced flow
Authors: Thomas G. J. Chandler, Saverio E. Spagnolie
Abstract: A body immersed in a nematic liquid crystal disturbs the fluid's preferred molecular configuration and increases its stored elastic energy. In an active nematic, the fluid components also generate a stress in the bulk fluid. By introducing either an immersed body or boundary, a large scale flow can be triggered due to anchoring boundary conditions alone -- a global pressure built by active stresses at equilibrium is instantly released everywhere. The fluid then imposes viscous, elastic, and active stresses on such surfaces which, if compliant, may result in a surface deformation. We study the deformations and stresses of a linearly elastic body placed in an active nematic in two dimensions. Using complex variables techniques, exact expressions for the fluid flow, director field, surface tractions, and body deformation are derived. Qualitative differences between elastic and active stress-driven deformations are identified, depending on an active Ericksen number, anchoring conditions, and body material properties, thereby suggesting a new method for measuring mechanical stresses in active anisotropic environments. Flow profiles, external confinement, and anchoring-induced stirring are also addressed.

Title: Tuning transport in solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures by Feshbach resonances
Authors: Caterina Zerba, Clemens Kuhlenkamp, Léo Mangeolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures have emerged as promising platforms for realizing tunable Bose-Fermi mixtures. Their constituents are fermionic charge carriers resonantly coupled to long-lived bosonic interlayer excitons, allowing them to form trion bound states. Such platforms promise to achieve comparable densities of fermions and bosons at low relative temperatures. Here, we predict the transport properties of Bose-Fermi mixtures close to a narrow solid-state Feshbach resonance. When driving a hole current, the response of doped holes, excitons, and trions are significantly modified by the resonant interactions, leading to deviations from the typical Drude behavior and to a sign change of the exciton drag. Our results on the temperature-dependent resistivities demonstrate that interaction effects dominate over established conventional scattering mechanisms in these solid-state Bose-Fermi mixtures.

Title: Emergent Fracton Hydrodynamics of Ultracold Atoms in Partially Filled Landau Levels
Authors: Caterina Zerba, Alexander Seidel, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: The realization of synthetic gauge fields for charge neutral ultracold atoms and the simulation of quantum Hall physics has witnessed remarkable experimental progress. Here, we establish key signatures of fractional quantum Hall systems in their non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. We show that in the lowest Landau level the system generically relaxes this http URL slow relaxation is understood from emergent conservation laws of the total charge and the associated dipole moment that arise from the effective Hamiltonian projected onto the lowest Landau level, leading to subdiffusive fracton hydrodynamics. We discuss the prospect of rotating quantum gases as well as ultracold atoms in optical lattices for observing this unconventional relaxation dynamics.

Title: Minimal thermodynamic cost of communication
Authors: Abhishek Yadav, David Wolpert
Abstract: Thermodynamic cost of communication is a major factor in the thermodynamic cost of real-world computers, both biological and digital. Despite its importance, the fundamental principles underlying this cost remain poorly understood. This paper makes two major contributions to addressing this gap. First, we derive a universal relationship between information transmission rate and minimal entropy production (EP) by focusing on the mismatch cost (MMC) component of thermodynamic cost. The resulting relationship holds independently of the underlying physical dynamics, making it broadly applicable. We discuss the implications of the derived minimal communication cost for work extraction in measurement-and-feedback protocols, and through examples involving binary channels, we show that the relationship between transmission rate and minimal thermodynamic cost can exhibit diminishing returns in certain scenarios. Second, we extend this thermodynamic analysis to the computational front and back ends critical to communication-namely, encoding and decoding to reduce errors in noisy transmission. Using the framework of periodic machines, we establish strictly positive minimal costs for implementing linear error-correcting codes. We compare these costs with end-to-end error rates, highlighting trade-offs between thermodynamic cost and decoding accuracy.

Title: Optical absorption activated by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse in metallic and superconducting states of the Hubbard model
Authors: Kazuya Shinjo, Shigetoshi Sota, Seiji Yunoki, Takami Tohyama
Abstract: The development of high-intensity ultrashort laser pulses unlocks the potential of pump-probe spectroscopy in sub-femtosecond timescale. Notably, subcycle pump pulses can generate electronic states unreachable by conventional multicycle pulses, leading to a phenomenon that we refer to as subcycle-pulse engineering. In this study, we employ the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization group method to unveil the transient absorption spectra of superconducting and metallic states in nearly half-filled one-dimensional and two-dimensional Hubbard models excited by an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, which can induce a current with inversion-symmetry breaking. In a superconducting state realized in attractive on-site interactions, we find the transient activation of absorptions at energies corresponding to the amplitude modes of superconducting and charge-density-wave states. On the other hand, in a metallic state realized in the two-dimensional model with repulsive on-site interactions, we obtain another type of absorption enhancements, which are distributed broadly in spin excitation energies. These findings indicate that superconducting and metallic states are sensitive to an ultrashort half-cycle pulse, leading to the transient activations of optical absorptions with their respective mechanisms.

Title: Long-time Freeness in the Kicked Top
Authors: Elisa Vallini, Silvia Pappalardi
Abstract: Recent work highlighted the importance of higher-order correlations in quantum dynamics for a deeper understanding of quantum chaos and thermalization. The full Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis, the framework encompassing correlations, can be formalized using the language of Free Probability theory. In this context, chaotic dynamics at long times are proposed to lead to free independence or "freeness" of observables. In this work, we investigate these issues in a paradigmatic semiclassical model - the kicked top - which exhibits a transition from integrability to chaos. Despite its simplicity, we identify several non-trivial features. By numerically studying 2n-point out-of-time-order correlators, we show that in the fully chaotic regime, long-time freeness is reached exponentially fast. These considerations lead us to introduce a large deviation theory for freeness that enables us to define and analyze the associated time scale. The numerical results confirm the existence of a hierarchy of different time scales, indicating a multifractal approach to freeness in this model. Our findings provide novel insights into the long-time behavior of chaotic dynamics and may have broader implications for the study of many-body quantum dynamics.

Title: CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a unique Co-antiferromagnetic topological heavy-fermion system with $P\cdot T$-protected Kondo effect and nodal-line excitations
Authors: Haoyu Hu, Yi Jiang, Defa Liu, Yulin Chen, Alexei M. Tsvelik, Yuanfeng Xu, Kristjan Haule, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: Based on high-throughput screening and experimental data, we find that CeCo$_2$P$_2$ is unique in heavy-fermion materials: it has a Kondo effect at a high temperature which is nonetheless below a Co-antiferromagnetic ordering temperature. This begs the question: how is the Kondo singlet formed? \emph{All} other magnetic Kondo materials do not first form magnetism on the atoms whose electrons are supposed to screen the local moments. We theoretically explain these observations and show the multifaceted uniqueness of CeCo$_2$P$_2$: a playground for Kondo, magnetism, flat band, and topological physics. At high temperatures, the itinerant Co $c$ electrons of the system form non-atomic bands with a narrow bandwidth, leading to a high antiferromagnetic transition temperature. We show that the quantum geometry of the bands promotes in-plane ferromagnetism, while the weak dispersion along the $z$ direction facilitates out-of-plane antiferromagnetism. At low temperatures, we uncover a novel phase that manifests the coexistence of Co-antiferromagnetism and the Kondo effect, linked to the $P\cdot T$-protected Kramers' doublets and the filling-enforced metallic nature of $c$ electrons in the antiferromagnetic phase. Subsequently, the emergence of the Kondo effect, in cooperation with glide-mirror-$z$ symmetry, creates nodal-line excitation near the Fermi energy. Our results emphasize the importance of lattice symmetry and quantum geometry, Kondo physics, and magnetism in the understanding of the correlation physics of this unique compound. We also test our theory on the structurally similar compound LaCo$_2$P$_2$ and show how we are able to understand its vastly different phase diagram.

Title: System-independent lower bounds on entropy production incurred by running a computer program
Authors: Abhishek Yadav, Francesco Caravelli, David Wolpert
Abstract: Mismatch cost (MMC) is a universally applicable lower bound on both the entropy production (EP) of any fixed physical process across a given time interval. In this work we use MMC for the first time to lower-bound the amount of work dissipated by running a high-level or assembler-level computer program. To begin, we extend previous results concerning MMC to prove that it scales at least linearly with the total heat flow in the worst case over initial distributions. This establishes that - in contrast to results like the thermodynamic speed limit theorem or thermodynamic uncertainty relations - it is often a substantial fraction of the work dissipated on macroscopic scales. We also prove that the MMC lower bound over a given time interval never decreases if the time interval is subdivided into a sequence of sub-intervals, and that the bound often increases. Armed with these results, we then introduce a general framework for computing the minimal EP (i.e., the MMC) associated with running any computer program on any physical system that implements a modern digital computer. Crucially, this framework holds completely independently of the microscopic physical details of that system. Next we apply this general framework to compare lower bounds on the EP incurred by running two canonical sorting algorithms, bubble sort and Bucket sort. This enables us to investigate how thermodynamic cost depends on features like input size and structure (e.g., with or without repeated entries). Finally, we extend the framework to programs that call subroutines.

Title: Limitations of tensor network approaches for optimization and sampling: A comparison to quantum and classical Ising machines
Authors: Anna Maria Dziubyna, Tomasz Śmierzchalski, Bartłomiej Gardas, Marek M. Rams, Masoud Mohseni
Abstract: Optimization problems pose challenges across various fields. In recent years, quantum annealers have emerged as a promising platform for tackling such challenges. To provide a new perspective, we develop a heuristic tensor network (TN) based algorithm to reveal the low-energy spectrum of Ising spin-glass systems with interaction graphs relevant to present-day quantum annealers. Our deterministic approach combines a branch-and-bound search strategy with an approximate calculation of marginals via TN contractions. Its application to quasi-two-dimensional lattices with large unit cells of up to 24 spins, realized in current quantum annealing processors, requires a dedicated approach that utilizes sparse structures in the TN representation and GPU hardware acceleration. We benchmark our approach on random problems defined on Pegasus and Zephyr graphs with up to a few thousand spins, comparing it against the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer and Simulated Bifurcation algorithm. Apart from the quality of the best solutions, we compare the diversity of low-energy states sampled by all the solvers. For the biggest considered i.i.d. problems with over 5000 spins, the state-of-the-art TN approach leads to solutions that are $0.1\%$ to $1\%$ worse than the best solutions obtained by Ising machines while being two orders of magnitude slower. We attribute those results to approximate contraction failures. For embedded tile planting instances, our approach gets to approximately $0.1\%$ from the planted ground state, a factor of $3$ better than the Ising solvers. While all three methods can output diverse low-energy solutions, e.g., differing by at least a quarter of spins with energy error below $1\%$, our deterministic branch-and-bound approach finds sets of a few such states at most. On the other hand, both Ising machines prove capable of sampling sets of thousands of such solutions.

Title: Chiral Phonons in 2D Halide Perovskites
Authors: Mike Pols, Geert Brocks, Sofía Calero, Shuxia Tao
Abstract: Phonons in chiral crystal structures can be circularly polarized, making them chiral. Chiral phonons carry angular momentum, which is observable in heat currents, and, via coupling to electron spin, in spin currents. Two-dimensional (2D) halide perovskites, versatile direct band gap semiconductors, can easily form chiral structures by incorporating chiral organic cations. As a result, they exhibit phenomena such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS) and the spin Seebeck effect, although the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Using on-the-fly machine-learning force fields trained against density functional theory calculations, we confirm the presence of chiral phonons, a potential key factor for these effects. Our analysis reveals that low-energy phonons, originating from the inorganic framework, primarily exhibit chirality. Under a temperature gradient, these chiral phonons generate substantial angular momentum, leading to experimentally observable effects. These findings position chiral 2D perovskites as a promising platform for exploring the interplay between phononic, electronic, spintronic, and thermal properties.

Title: Toroidal Moments in Confined Nanomagnets and their Impact on Magnonics
Authors: Felipe Brevis, Lukas Körber, B. Mimica-Figari, Rodolfo A. Gallardo, Attila Kákay, Pedro Landeros
Abstract: The nonreciprocity created by dipolar coupling, electric currents, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions is discussed in cases where the magnon propagation direction has a component parallel to the toroidal moment. A criterion for calculating the toroidal moments is established, addressing the issue of correct origin selection by considering compensated and uncompensated magnetization distributions. This criterion is then applied to various nonreciprocal magnetic systems, with the calculations consistent with those reported in the literature and predicting the existence of nonreciprocity in a more general manner. These results broaden the physical significance of the toroidal moment and facilitate the identification and estimation of nonreciprocity in magnonic systems. This work also clarifies the interrelations between different definitions of the toroidal moment for confined structures, where a surface term arising from surface-bound currents connects these definitions without the need for time-averaging. Comparing these definitions of the toroidal moment applied to different magnetic textures demonstrates that they are always parallel but may differ in magnitude and sign. The discrepancy in the different definitions is deemed irrelevant since its direction, rather than its magnitude, primarily predicts the existence of magnon nonreciprocity.

Title: Franck-Condon electron emission from polar semiconductor photocathodes
Authors: W. Andreas Schroeder, L. A. Angeloni, I-J. Shan, L. B. Jones
Abstract: A presented analytical formulation of (optical)phonon-mediated and momentum-resonant Franck-Condon emission of photoexcited electrons from polar semiconductors is shown to be very consistent with (i) the observed emission properties of a Cesiated GaAs(001) photocathode at 808nm [J. Phys. D: Appl. Phys. 54, 205301 (2021)] and (ii) the measured spectral emission properties of a GaN(0001) photocathode from just below its bandgap energy to 5eV. The theoretical analysis in the parabolic band approximation predicts the form of both the quantum efficiency and mean transverse energy of photoemission as a function of the photocathode's electron affinity and the electron temperature in the vicinity of its emission face. The good agreement between theory and experimental data also suggests that sub-10nm rms surface roughness effects are not significant for polar semiconductor photocathodes.

Title: Topological junction states in graphene nanoribbons: A route to topological chemistry
Authors: Hazem Abdelsalam, Domenico Corona, Renebeth B. Payod, Mahmoud A. S. Sakr, Omar H. Abd-Elkader, Qinfang Zhang, Vasil A. Saroka
Abstract: Two-dimensional topological insulators with propagating topological edge states are promising for dissipationless transport, while their one-dimensional analogs are capable of hosting localized topological junction states that are mainly envisaged for quantum computing and spintronics. Here, in contrast, we propose to use the localized nature of topological junction states for sensing applications. We report a systematic topological classification of a wide class of graphene nanoribbons represented by already synthesized extended chevron species. Using this classification, we theoretically model a double junction transport that shows an enhanced interaction with the NO$_2$ molecule. Our results show that topological junction states of nanoribbons can open an avenue for topological sensing and junction-assisted chemistry applications.

Title: Can solvents tie knots? Helical folds of biopolymers in liquid environments
Authors: Rhoslyn Coles, Myfanwy E. Evans
Abstract: Helices are the quintessential geometric motif of the microscale, from alpha-helices in proteins to double helices in DNA. Assembly of the helical geometry of biopolymers is a foundational step in a hierarchy of structure that eventually leads to biological activity. By simulating folding in a simplified setting we probe the role of the solvent in the collaborative processes governing biomaterials. Using a simulation technique based on the morphometric approach to solvation, we performed computer experiments in which a short, flexible tube-modelling a biopolymer in an aqueous environment-folds solely based on the interaction of the tube with the solvent. Our findings reveal a variety of helical structures that assemble depending on solvent conditions, including overhand knots and symmetric double helices. By differentiating the role of solvation, our work illuminates the environment of all soluble biomolecules, demonstrating that the solvent can drive fundamental rearrangements, even up to tying a simple overhand knot.

Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of the Two-Dimensional Model of Transistors
Authors: Jiayin Gu
Abstract: We adopt a stochastic approach to study the charge transport in transistors. In this approach, the hole and electron densities are ruled by diffusion-reaction stochastic partial differential equations satisfying local detailed balance condition. The electric field is supposed to be concentrated in very narrow regions around the two junctions and is also approximated to be static. In this way, not only the laws of electricity, thermodynamics, and microreversibility is consistent within this approach, but also the transistor can be easily modeled as a two-dimensional system. We perform the full counting statistics of the two coupled currents, and the fluctuation theorem is shown to hold. Moreover, we show that the geometric shape of the transistor exert great influence on the transport behavior. By modeling the transistor in two dimensions, the signal-amplification factor up to about $164$ can be achieved, which is comparable to the typical value of realistic transistors in industry.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a class of nonequilibrium phases of matter that exhibit robust subharmonic responses to periodic driving without requiring disorder. Prior realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of either spontaneous or induced finite polarization. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals (UPDTCs) that do not require finite polarization. By studying a spin model of periodically driven trapped ions, we show that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization for paramagnetic initial states, even when the staggered magnetization itself vanishes. The key insight is that quantum fluctuations alone are sufficient to reveal coherent DTC-like dynamics. We demonstrate that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, consistent with Floquet prethermalization. Our results expand the known phenomenology of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases. We propose an experimental protocol to observe UPDTCs in trapped-ion simulators.

Title: Conditions for orbital selective altermagnetism in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$: tight binding model, similarities with cuprates and implications on superconductivity
Authors: Carmine Autieri, Giuseppe Cuono, Debmalya Chakraborty, Paola Gentile, Annica M. Black-Schaffer
Abstract: The vibrational modes in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ easily induce octahedral rotations without tilting. Being on the verge of a magnetic instability, such propensity of octahedral rotation may also produce magnetic fluctuations. In this work, we analyze the long-range magnetic phase diagram incorporating such octahedral rotations and demonstrate the possibility of an altermagnetic phase in Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Using ab-initio calculations, we first study single layer Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ with octahedral rotations, obtaining an orbital-selective $g$-wave altermagnetic phase. We further provide an effective $t_{2g}$ tight-binding model, demonstrating that the $g$-wave altermagnetism is primarily a product of second and third nearest neighbor interorbital hybridizations between the ${\gamma}z$ ($\gamma=x,y$) orbitals, but only a much longer range intraorbital hybridization in the $xy$ orbitals, establishing a strong orbital-selectiveness for the altermagnetism. Notably, by replacing the $xy$ orbital with the $x^2-y^2$ orbital, a similar tight-biding model may be used to investigate the hole-doped cuprate superconductors. We then study bulk Sr$_2$RuO$_4$, where we find the altermagnetic phase as the magnetic ground state for a range of finite octahedral rotations. In the bulk, interlayer hopping breaks some of the symmetries of the $g$-wave altermagnet, resulting in a $d_{xy}$-wave altermagnet, still with orbital selectiveness. We also include relativistic effects through spin-orbit coupling and obtain that an effective staggered Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction generates weak ferromagnetism. Finally, we discuss the implications of the altermagnetic order on the intrinsic superconductivity of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$. Assuming in-plane and intraorbital pairing, the altermagnetism favors spin-singlet $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave or $g$-wave pairing, or (nematic or chiral) combinations thereof.

Abstract: Quantum annealing is a promising algorithm for solving combinatorial optimization problems. However, various hardware restrictions significantly impede its efficient performance. Size-reduction methods provide an effective approach for addressing large-scale problems but often introduce additional challenges. A notable hardware restriction is the limited number of decision variables quantum annealing can handle compared to the size of the problem. Moreover, when employing size-reduction methods, the interactions and local magnetic fields in the Ising model--used to represent the combinatorial optimization problem--can become excessively large, making them difficult to implement on hardware. Although prior studies suggest that energy rescaling impacts the performance of quantum annealing, its interplay with size-reduction methods remains unexplored. This study examines the relationship between fixing spins, a promising size-reduction method, and the effects of energy rescaling. Numerical simulations and experiments conducted on a quantum annealer demonstrate that the fixing spins method enhances quantum annealing performance while preserving the spin-chain embedding for a homogeneous, fully connected ferromagnetic Ising model.

Title: Emergence of single-particle mobility edge (SPME) in a ladder network under a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion
Authors: Arpita Goswami
Abstract: We examine the localization transition in a two-leg ladder model incorporating a slowly varying quasiperiodic distortion as an inter-leg hopping in different parametric regions. In our model, we have introduced a distortion that is neither periodic (Bloch-type) nor random (Anderson-type) but instead has a slowly varying pseudorandom pattern described by $\Gamma_{n}= \lambda cos(2 \pi Q n^{\nu})$, where $0<\nu <1$. We have demonstrated that in the ladder model at $0<\nu <1$ limit, there is some point at which it is not possible to see a pure metal-insulator transition due to the presence of a single particle mobility edge (SPME) state. We have seen that, unlike the one-dimensional AA model, where the slowly varying potential has been introduced as an onsite potential term, the delocalized states are present beyond the $ \lambda=2t$ limit. Further analysis shows that a pure metal-to-insulator transition occurs for $\nu=1$ at $\lambda=2t.$ We also studied the scale-invariant nature of the mobility edge, which confirms its robustness. The wave packet dynamics also validates the presence of the mobility edge. We have seen that for the point $\nu < 1$ the wave packet dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through nearly-ballistic (nearly delocalized) to superdiffusive (fractal) phase. In contrast to $\nu <1$, for $\nu=1$ the dynamics goes through the transition: ballistic (delocalized) through ordinary diffusive (critical) to localized phase.

Title: Is attention all you need to solve the correlated electron problem?
Authors: Max Geier, Khachatur Nazaryan, Timothy Zaklama, Liang Fu
Abstract: The attention mechanism has transformed artificial intelligence research by its ability to learn relations between objects. In this work, we explore how a many-body wavefunction ansatz constructed from a large-parameter self-attention neural network can be used to solve the interacting electron problem in solids. By a systematic neural-network variational Monte Carlo study on a moiré quantum material, we demonstrate that the self-attention ansatz provides an accurate and efficient solution without human bias. Moreover, our numerical study finds that the required number of variational parameters scales roughly as $N^2$ with the number of electrons, which opens a path towards efficient large-scale simulations.

Title: Unveiling Optimal Diffusion for Infection Control in Brownian Particle Systems
Authors: Kaito Takahashi, Makiko Sasada, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: Understanding the spread of infectious diseases requires integrating movement, physical constraints, and spatial configurations into epidemiological models. In this study, we investigate how particle diffusivity, hardcore interactions, and non-equilibrium initial conditions influence infection dynamics within a system of Brownian particles. Using numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we reveal a nontrivial relationship between diffusivity and the speed of infection spread. Specifically, when particles are initially positioned at uniform distances greater than the infection radius -- a non-equilibrium configuration -- there exists an optimal diffusion coefficient that minimizes the infection propagation speed. This counterintuitive result arises from the competition between diffusive timescales and the rate of infection transmission. The presence of an optimal diffusivity is observed both in systems with and without hardcore interactions, provided that the infection radius exceeds the mean lattice spacing. Our findings provide a theoretical framework for understanding and controlling the spread of infections in confined and diffusive environments, with potential implications for designing movement-based strategies for infection control.

Title: Filling a gap in materials mechanics: Nanoindentation at high constant strain rates upto $10^5 s^{-1}$
Authors: Lalith Kumar Bhaskar, Dipali Sonawane, Hendrik Holz, Jeongin Paeng, Peter Schweizer, Jing Rao, Bárbara Bellón, Damian Frey, Aloshious Lambai, Laszlo Petho, Johann Michler, Jakob Schwiedrzik, Gaurav Mohanty, Gerhard Dehm, Rajaprakash Ramachandramoorthy
Abstract: A central focus in high strain rate research is understanding the dynamic behavior of materials at strain rates where a strength upturn is observed. While strength upturns at strain rates of $10^3$ to $10^4~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ have been widely reported in the literature, their occurrence in certain materials remains controversial, and the underlying physics driving this phenomenon is not yet fully understood. Current mechanical testing methods are limited, as no single technique spans the full strain rate range of $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ where this phenomenon is expected, and a unified technique would enable consistent post-deformation characterization with minimal error. To address this, we developed a customized piezoelectric in situ nanomechanical test setup, enabling constant indentation strain rates up to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ for the first time. Using this system, we examined rate-dependent hardness in single-crystalline molybdenum, nanocrystalline nickel, and amorphous fused silica over strain rates from $10^1$ to $10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$, remarkably revealing a hardness upturn in all three materials. Further, post-deformation analysis of single-crystalline molybdenum revealed that the hardness upturn was primarily driven by increased dislocation density, with phonon drag -- traditionally considered a dominant contributor -- playing a minimal role.

Title: Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: Y.K. Edathumkandy, K. Das, K. Gas, D. Sztenkiel, D. Hommel, H. Przybylińska, M. Sawicki
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$\%), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70~K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. We quantitatively describe both FMR and SQUID observables using atomistic spin model operating on a common set of parameters. The level of agreement, achieved without tuning parameters between datasets, demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the approach in capturing the essential physics of spin-diluted, percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the square lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Machine-learning-based variational Monte Carlo simulations are a promising approach for targeting quantum many-body ground states, especially in two dimensions and in cases where the ground state is known to have a non-trivial sign structure. While many state-of-the-art variational energies have been reached with these methods for finite-size systems, little work has been done to use these results to extract information about the target state in the thermodynamic limit. In this work, we employ recurrent neural networks (RNNs) as a variational ansätze, and leverage their recurrent nature to simulate the ground states of progressively larger systems through iterative retraining. This transfer learning technique allows us to simulate spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ systems on lattices with more than 1,000 spins without beginning optimization from scratch for each system size, thus reducing the demands for computational resources. In this study, we focus on the square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, where it is possible to carefully benchmark our results. We show that we are able to systematically improve the accuracy of the results from our simulations by increasing the training time, and obtain results for finite-sized lattices that are in good agreement with the literature values. Furthermore, we use these results to extract accurate estimates of the ground-state properties in the thermodynamic limit. This work demonstrates that RNN wavefunctions can be used to accurately study quantum many-body physics in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Quantum Level-Crossing Induced by Anisotropy in Spin-1 Heisenberg Dimers: Applications to Quantum Stirling Engines
Authors: Bastian Castorene, Vinicius Gomez de Paula, Francisco J. Peña, Clebson Cruz, Mario Reis, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: This work explores the thermodynamic performance of a quantum Stirling heat engine implemented with an anisotropic spin-1 Heisenberg dimer as the working medium. Using the Hamiltonian of the system, we analyze the interplay of anisotropy, magnetic field, and exchange interactions and their influence on the energy spectrum and the quantum level crossing. Our results reveal that double-degenerate point (DDP) and a triple-degenerate point (TDP) play pivotal roles in shaping the operational regimes and efficiency of the quantum Stirling engine. At those points, the Carnot efficiency reaches higher work output and enhanced stability, making it a robust candidate for optimal thermodynamic performance. These findings highlight the potential of anisotropic spin systems as viable platforms for quantum heat engines and contribute to advancing the field of quantum thermodynamics.

Title: Universal Anyon Tunneling in a Chiral Luttinger Liquid
Authors: Ramon Guerrero-Suarez, Adithya Suresh, Tanmay Maiti, Shuang Liang, James Nakamura, Geoffrey Gardner, Claudio Chamon, Michael Manfra
Abstract: The edge modes of fractional quantum Hall liquids are described by chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Despite many years of experimental investigation fractional quantum Hall edge modes remain enigmatic with significant discrepancies between experimental observations and detailed predictions of chiral Luttinger liquid theory. Here we report measurements of tunneling conductance between counterpropagating edge modes at $\nu=1/3$ across a quantum point contact fabricated on an AlGaAs/GaAs heterostructure designed to promote a sharp confinement potential. We present evidence for tunneling of anyons through a $\nu=1/3$ incompressible liquid that exhibits universal scaling behavior with respect to temperature, source-drain bias, and barrier transmission, as originally proposed by Wen [1, 2]. For transmission $t\geq0.800$, we measured the tunneling exponent $\bar{g} = 0.333 \pm 0.005$ averaged over 29 independent data sets, consistent with the scaling dimension $\Delta = g/2 = 1/6$ for a Laughlin quasiparticle at the edge. When combined with measurements of the fractional charge $e^*=e/3$ and the recently observed anyonic statistical angle $\theta_a=\frac{2\pi}{3}$, the measured tunneling exponent fully characterizes the topological order of the primary Laughlin state at $\nu=1/3$.

Title: Metastability and Ostwald Step Rule in the Crystallisation of Diamond and Graphite from Molten Carbon
Authors: Davide Donadio, Margaret L. Berrens, Wanyu Zhao, Shunda Chen, Tianshu Li
Abstract: The crystallisation of carbon from the melt under extreme conditions is highly relevant to earth and planetary science, materials manufacturing, and nuclear fusion research. The thermodynamic conditions near the graphite-diamond-liquid (GDL) triple point are especially of interest for geological and technological applications, but high-pressure flash heating experiments aiming to resolve this region of the phase diagram of carbon exhibit large discrepancies. Experimental challenges are often related to the persistence of metastable crystalline or glassy phases, superheated crystals, or supercooled liquids. A deeper understanding of the crystallisation kinetics of diamond and graphite is crucial for effectively interpreting the outcomes of these experiments. Here, we reveal the microscopic mechanisms of diamond and graphite nucleation from liquid carbon through molecular simulations with first-principles machine learning potentials. Our simulations accurately reproduce the experimental phase diagram of carbon in the region around the GDL triple point and show that liquid carbon crystallises spontaneously upon cooling at constant pressure. Surprisingly, metastable graphite crystallises in the domain of diamond thermodynamic stability at pressures above the triple point. Furthermore, whereas diamond crystallises through a classical nucleation pathway, graphite follows a two-step process in which low-density fluctuations forego ordering. Calculations of the nucleation rates of the two competing phases confirm this result and reveal a manifestation of Ostwald's step rule where the strong metastability of graphite hinders the transformation to the stable diamond phase. Our results provide a new key to interpreting melting and recrystallisation experiments and shed light on nucleation kinetics in polymorphic materials with deep metastable states.

Title: Revealing Quantum Geometry in Nonlinear Quantum Materials
Authors: Yiyang Jiang, Tobias Holder, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Berry curvature-related topological phenomena have been a central topic in condensed matter physics. Yet, until recently other quantum geometric quantities such as the metric and connection received only little attention due to the relatively few effects which have been documented for them. This review gives a modern perspective how quantum geometric quantities naturally enter the nonlinear responses of quantum materials and demonstrate their deep connection with excitation energy, lifetimes, symmetry, and corresponding physical processes. The multitude of nonlinear responses can be subdivided into nonlinear optical effects, subgap responses, and nonlinear transport phenomena. Such a distinction by energy scales facilitates an intuitive understanding of the underlying electronic transitions, giving rise to a unified picture of the electron motion beyond linear order. The well-known injection and shift currents constitute the main resonances in the optical regime. Exploiting their respective lifetime and symmetry dependencies, this review elucidates how these resonances can be distinguished by a corresponding quantum geometric quantity that shares the same symmetry. This is followed by a brief exposition of the role of quasiparticle lifetimes for nonlinear subgap responses, which presents a window into the microscopic short-term dynamics as well as the ground state correlation and localization. We conclude with an account of the anomalous motion due to the Berry curvature dipole and quantum metric dipole in nonlinear transport, clarifying the correspondence between physical observables and the underlying mechanisms. This review highlights the close relationship between quantum geometry and nonlinear response, showing the way towards promising probes of quantum geometry and enabling novel avenues to characterize complex materials.

Title: Photoluminescence from metal nanostructures -- dependence on size
Authors: Imon Kalyan, Ieng Wai Un, Gilles Rosolen, Nir Shitrit, Yonatan Sivan
Abstract: For decades, there have been multiple seemingly contradicting experimental reports on the dependence of the photoluminescence from metal nanostructures on their size. We reconcile these reports using a simple analytic formula which is found to match well photoluminescence measurements for a range of structures and illumination conditions. Our expression requires only knowledge of the local electric field and temperature, and it points to the physical quantities that determine the emission strength and its dependence on size.

Title: Capillary force-driven particle orientation in rod networks
Authors: Lingyue Liu, Sebastian Gassenmeier, Erin Koos
Abstract: Hypothesis: Anisotropic rod particles in capillary suspensions form complex network structures with distinctive orientation patterns and rheological properties that differ significantly from spherical particle systems. By identifying the orientation of individual particles, we are able to acquire invaluable experimental insight into the bulk particle orientation measurements. Experiments: Glass microrods were dispersed in capillary suspensions with varied secondary liquid volume fractions. The resulting microstructural characteristics were analyzed using confocal microscopy. Meanwhile, their rheological properties were measured through rheometry and rheoconfocal techniques. Particle networks were quantified in terms of coordination number, clustering coefficient, and orientation distribution. Findings: As the secondary liquid volume fraction increased, rod networks transitioned from point-to-point contact configurations to side-to-side aligned clusters. Unlike spherical systems, the average clustering coefficient decreased with increasing coordination number, indicating the formation of complex particle cluster configurations beyond simple side-to-side alignment. The rod networks demonstrated higher sensitivity to deformation, and samples with higher side-to-side contact probability exhibit higher viscoplastic fragility. These results provide a foundation for designing advanced materials with precisely tunable mechanical properties through controlled anisotropic particle interactions in capillary suspensions.

Title: Penetration of surface effects on structural relaxation and particle hops in glassy films
Authors: Qiang Zhai, Hai-Yao Deng, Xin-Yuan Gao, Leo S.I. Lam, Sen Yang, Ke Yan, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: A free surface induces enhanced dynamics in glass formers. We study the dynamical enhancement of glassy films with a distinguishable-particle lattice model of glass free of elastic effects. We demonstrate that the thickness of the surface mobile layer depends on temperature differently under different definitions, although all are based on local structure relaxation rate. The rate can be fitted to a double exponential form with an exponential-of-power-law tail. Our approach and results exclude elasticity as the unique mechanism for the tail. Layer-resolved particle hopping rate, potentially a key measure for activated hopping, is also studied but it exhibits much shallower surface effects.

Title: Planar Josephson junction devices with narrow superconducting strips: Topological properties and optimization
Authors: Purna P. Paudel, Javad Shabani, Tudor D. Stanescu
Abstract: We study the low-energy physics of planar Josephson junction structures realized in a quasi-two dimensional semiconductor system proximity-coupled to narrow superconducting films. Using both a recursive Green's function approach and an effective Hamiltonian approximation, we investigate the topological superconducting phase predicted to emerge in this type of system. We first characterize the effects associated with varying the electrostatic potentials applied within the unproximitized semiconductor regions. We then address the problem of optimizing the width of the superconductor films and identifying the optimal regimes characterized by large topological gap values. We find that structures with narrow superconducting films of widths ranging between about $100~$nm and $200~$nm can support topological superconducting phases with gaps up to $40\%$ of the parent superconducting gap, significantly larger than those characterizing the corresponding wide-superconductor structures. This work represents the first component of a proposed comprehensive strategy to address this optimization problem in planar Josephson junction structures and realize robust topological devices.

Title: Excitonic effects in phonons: reshaping the graphene Kohn anomalies and lifetimes
Authors: Alberto Guandalini, Francesco Macheda, Giovanni Caldarelli, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: We develop an ab initio framework that captures the impact of electron-electron and electron-hole interactions on phonon properties. This enables the inclusion of excitonic effects in the optical phonon dispersions and lifetimes of graphene, both near the center ($\Gamma$) and at the border (K) of the Brillouin zone, at phonon momenta relevant for Raman scattering and for the onset of the intrinsic electrical resistivity. Near K, we find a phonon red-shift of ~150 $cm^{-1}$ and a 10x enhancement of the group velocity, together with a 5x increase in linewidths due to a 26x increase of the electron-phonon matrix elements. These effects persist for doping $2E_{F} < {\hbar}{\omega}_{ph}$ and are quenched at higher dopings. Near $\Gamma$, the excitonic effects are minor because of the gauge field nature of the electron-phonon coupling at small phonon momentum.

Title: Real Space Visualization of Order-Disorder Transition in BaTiO3
Authors: Yang Zhang, Xiaoming Shi, Suk Hyun Sung, Cong Li, Houbing Huang, Pu Yu, Ismail El Baggari
Abstract: Ferroelectricity in BaTiO3 was observed nearly eighty years ago, but the mechanism underlying its ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition remains elusive. The order-disorder transition has been recognized as playing a critical role, however, the precise nature of the order parameter still remains under scrutiny, including the local dipole direction and the correlations above and below the Curie temperature. Using in situ scanning transmission electron microscopy, we directly map polar displacements in BaTiO3 across the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transition, providing atomistic insights into a order-disorder mechanism. Atomic tracking reveals finite polar Ti displacements in the paraelectric phase where they manifest as random polar nanoregions. The displacements align along <111> direction in both the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. The paraelectric-ferroelectric transition emerges from real-space correlations of the <111> polar Ti displacements. Our direct visualizations provides atomic insights into the order-disorder mechanism in the ferroelectric-paraelectric transition of BaTiO3.

Title: First-principles electron-phonon interactions with self-consistent Hubbard interaction: an application to transparent conductive oxides
Authors: Wooil Yang, Sabyasachi Tiwari, Feliciano Giustino, Young-Woo Son
Abstract: The ab initio computational method known as Hubbard-corrected density functional theory (DFT+$U$) captures well ground electronic structures of a set of solids that are poorly described by standard DFT alone. Since lattice dynamical properties are closely linked to electronic structures, the Hubbard-corrected density functional perturbation theory (DFPT+$U$) can calculate them at the same level of accuracy. To investigate the effects of $U$ on electron-phonon (el-ph) interactions, we implemented DFPT+$U$ with a Hartree-Fock-based pseudohybrid functional formalism to determine $U$ self-consistently and applied our method to compute optical and transport properties of transparent conductive oxides of CdO and ZnO. For CdO, we find that opening a band gap due to $U$ restores the long-range Fröhlich interaction and that its calculated mobility and absorption spectrum are in excellent agreement with experiments. For ZnO where a band gap already appears at the DFT level, DFPT+$U$ brings the results into much closer alignment with experiment, thus demonstrating improved accuracy of our method in dealing with el-ph interactions in these technologically important materials.

Title: Phase domain walls in coherently driven Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: S. S. Gavrilov
Abstract: We consider coherent states of weakly interacting bosons under the conditions of external resonant excitation, with a focus on a two-dimensional polariton fluid driven by a plane electromagnetic wave near the ground state. The coherent driving breaks the U(1) symmetry explicitly, which prevents the occurrence of quantum vortices in a uniform scalar condensate. Surprisingly, a spinor (two-component) system of the same kind admits topological excitations, such as domain walls of relative phase or confined half-vortex molecules, typical of a freely evolving spinor Bose system. Opposite-phase domains arise from the spontaneous breakdown of the spin symmetry $(\mathbb{Z}_2)$. Domain walls form with time even when the initial state of the system is uniform or completely disordered; they fall into different topological types distinguished by the total phase variation in the transverse direction.

Title: Relating thermodynamic quantities of convex-hard-body fluids to the body's shape
Authors: Thomas Franosch, Cristiano De Michele, Rolf Schilling
Abstract: For a fluid of convex hard particles, characterized by a length scale $\sigma_\text{min}$ and an anisotropy parameter $\epsilon$, we develop a formalism allowing one to relate thermodynamic quantities to the body's shape. In a first step its thermodynamics is reduced to that of spherical particles. The latter have a hard core of diameter $\sigma_\text{min }$ and a soft shell with a thickness $\epsilon \sigma_\text{min}/2$. Besides their hard core repulsion at $\sigma_\text{min }$ they interact by effective entropic forces which will be calculated. Based on this mapping, a second step provides a perturbative method for the systematic calculation of thermodynamic quantities with the shape anisotropy $\epsilon$ as smallness parameter. In leading order in $\epsilon $, the equation of state is derived as a functional of the particle's shape. To illustrate these findings, they are applied to a one- and two-dimensional fluid of ellipses and compared with results from different analytical approaches, and our computer simulations. The mapping to spherical particles also implies that any phase transition of spherical particles, e.g., the liquid-hexatic transition, also exists for the nonspherical ones, and shifts linearly with $\epsilon $ for weak shape anisotropy. This is supported by our Monte-Carlo simulation.

Title: A new generation of effective core potentials: Selected lanthanides and heavy elements II
Authors: Omar Madany, Benjamin Kincaid, Aqsa Shaikh, Elizabeth Morningstar, Lubos Mitas
Abstract: We present a new set of correlation-consistent effective core potentials (ccECPs) for selected heavy $s$, $p$, $d$, and $f$-block elements significant in materials science and chemistry (Rb, Sr, Cs, Ba, In, Sb, Pb, Ru, Cd, La, Ce, and Eu). The ccECPs are designed using minimal Gaussian parameterization to achieve smooth and bounded potentials. They are expressed as a combination of averaged relativistic effective potentials (AREP) and effective spin-orbit (SO) terms, developed within a relativistic coupled-cluster framework. The optimization is driven by correlated all-electron (AE) atomic spectra, norm-conservation, and spin-orbit splittings, with considerations for plane wave cut-offs to ensure accuracy and viability across various electronic configurations. Transferability of these ccECPs is validated through testing on molecular oxides and hydrides, emphasizing discrepancies in molecular binding energies across a spectrum of bond lengths and electronic environments. The ccECPs demonstrate excellent agreement with AE reference calculations, attaining chemical accuracy in bond dissociation energies and equilibrium bond lengths, even in systems characterized by substantial relativistic and correlation effects. These ccECPs provide accurate and transferable framework for valence-only calculations.

Title: Auger parameter analysis for TiN and AlN thin films via combined in-situ XPS and HAXPES
Authors: O.V. Pshyk, J. Patidar, C. Cancellieri, S. Siol
Abstract: Auger parameter analysis provides in-depth information about the electronic and chemical bonding properties of TiN and AlN thin films, which are relevant across a wide range of technologies. Meaningful interpretation and analysis of the Auger parameter of these materials have been hindered due to, among other reasons, the absence of reliable references. Here we present a comprehensive study of Auger parameters for TiN and AlN thin films using a dual-source lab-based XPS/HAXPES system equipped with Al Ka and Cr Ka x-ray sources. Due to a large spread of excitation x-ray energy, bulk- and surface-sensitive core-level photoelectrons and Auger transitions are probed. This allows us to study a wide range of Auger and core-level emission lines of TiN and AlN. These measurements can serve as references for further identification of chemical state changes, oxidation state or any deviations in the local chemical environment in these materials. UHV sample transfer was employed to minimise surface contamination. Additionally, we demonstrate how common procedures such as ambient air exposure and Ar+ sputter-etching influence the Auger parameters, highlighting the importance of surface preparation in spectroscopic analysis.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.

Title: On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models
Authors: Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Title: A Quantum-Inspired Framework for Subjective Evaluation: Cognitive Polarization and Entropic Measures
Authors: Bumned Soodchomshom
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired framework to model subjective evaluation processes using state vectors in Hilbert space. In this approach, individual preferences are represented as cognitive states polarized between 'like' and 'dislike', enabling a continuous interpretation of evaluative attitudes. The evolution of these states is characterized on the Bloch sphere, and the cognitive coherence is interpreted geometrically. To further analyze the uncertainty and diversity in subjective preferences, we introduce both Shannon entropy (at the individual level) and Von Neumann entropy (at the group level) into the framework. A small-scale simulated dataset is used to conceptually demonstrate how these entropy measures can reveal internal indecisiveness and collective incoherence. The model offers a physically grounded and mathematically expressive tool for quantifying subjectivity.

Title: Transient dynamics of associative memory models
Authors: David G. Clark
Abstract: Associative memory models such as the Hopfield network and its dense generalizations with higher-order interactions exhibit a "blackout catastrophe"--a discontinuous transition where stable memory states abruptly vanish when the number of stored patterns exceeds a critical capacity. This transition is often interpreted as rendering networks unusable beyond capacity limits. We argue that this interpretation is largely an artifact of the equilibrium perspective. We derive dynamical mean-field equations using a bipartite cavity approach for graded-activity dense associative memory models, with the Hopfield model as a special case, and solve them using a numerical scheme. We show that patterns can be transiently retrieved with high accuracy above capacity despite the absence of stable attractors. This occurs because slow regions persist in the above-capacity energy landscape near stored patterns as lingering traces of the stable basins that existed below capacity. The same transient-retrieval effect occurs in below-capacity networks initialized outside basins of attraction. "Transient-recovery curves" provide a concise visual summary of these effects, revealing graceful, non-catastrophic changes in retrieval behavior above capacity and allowing us to compare the behavior across interaction orders. This dynamical perspective reveals rich energy landscape structure obscured by equilibrium analysis and suggests biological neural circuits may exploit transient dynamics for memory retrieval. Furthermore, our approach suggests ways of understanding computational properties of neural circuits without reference to fixed points, advances the technical repertoire of numerical mean-field solution methods for recurrent neural networks, and yields new theoretical results on generalizations of the Hopfield model.

Title: Crossover between Solid-like and Liquid-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids
Authors: X. R. Tian, D. M. Zhang, B. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
Abstract: In supercooled liquids, at a temperature between the glass transition temperature Tg and the melting point Tm, thermodynamic properties remain continuous, while dynamic behavior exhibits anomalies. The origin of such thermodynamics-dynamic decoupling has long been a puzzle in the field of glass researches. In this study, we show that the ratio of the alpha-relaxation time associated with the relative and center-of-mass coordinate of nearest-neighbor atomic pairs can effectively characterize the dynamic features of supercooled liquids. With this approach, supercooled liquids can be categorized into two distinct 'states' based on their dynamics: solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. We further propose four possible paths from the liquid to the final glass state, each exhibiting unique thermodynamic and dynamic behaviors. Two of these paths predict a characteristic temperature Tx between Tm and Tg, where a crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors occurs in supercooled liquids. The molecular dynamics simulations of several supercooled liquids reveal that the actual path followed by all these systems undergo the crossover between solid-like and liquid-like behaviors. Tx is found to reside in a similar temperature range as the critical temperature Tc in the mode-coupling theory and the breakdown temperature Tb of the Stokes-Einstein relation. This crossover provides a new microscopic perspective for explaining macroscopic dynamic anomalies, and the absence of a typical thermodynamic phase transition at Tg.

Title: Cavity-Mediated Gas-Liquid Transition
Authors: Fan Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the gas-liquid transition in a binary Bose-Einstein condensate, where the two Zeeman-shifted hyperfine spin components are coupled by cavity-assisted Raman processes. Below a critical Zeeman field, the cavity becomes superradiant for an infinitesimally small pumping strength, where the enhanced superradiance is facilitated by the simultaneous formation of quantum droplet, a self-bound liquid phase stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Above the critical Zeeman field, the gas-liquid transition only takes place at a finite pumping strength after the system becomes superradiant. As the back action of the gas-liquid transition, the superradiant cavity field undergoes an abrupt jump at the first-order transition point. Furthermore, as a result of the fixed density ratio of the quantum droplet, the cavity field exhibits a linear scaling with the pumping strength in the liquid phase. These features serve as prominent signals for the cavity-mediated gas-liquid transition and coexistence, which derive from the interplay of Zeeman field, cavity-assisted spin mixing, and quantum fluctuations.

Title: Approach to network failure due to intrinsic fluctuations
Authors: Shaunak Roy, Vimal Kishore, M. S. Santhanam
Abstract: A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support flux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be triggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or for internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the asymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures. In this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic fluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as extreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be identified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach to network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively similar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks. We obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an all-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real transportation network of flights.

Title: Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal
Authors: Yifei Bai, Anna R. Dardia, Toshihiko Shimasaki, David M. Weld
Abstract: Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.

Title: Conformal anomaly and gravitational pair production
Authors: M. N. Chernodub
Abstract: We conjecture that the time-reversal-even component of the pair production rate $\Gamma$ of particles in background fields in conformal 3+1 dimensional field theories is given by the anomalous trace $\langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle$ of the energy-momentum tensor: $\Gamma = (\pi/2) \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu} \rangle \Theta( \langle T^\mu_{\ \mu}\rangle)$, where $\Theta(x)$ is the Heaviside step function. We show that this relation, written in mostly-plus metric, correctly describes the one-loop Schwinger pair creation of massless particles both in scalar and spinor versions of quantum electrodynamics. It also accurately points to the Savvidi instability of the gluonic vacuum towards the formation of the chromomagnetic condensate. The conjectured formula also reproduces (presumably, non-Hawking) radiation generated by static gravitational fields in the absence of an event horizon via a new evaporation mechanism suggested in [Phys. Rev. Lett. 130, 221502 (2023)]. A concurrent mechanism of the particle production due to the axial anomaly is briefly discussed and critical remarks on the state-dependence are also given.

Title: A Foundation of the Boltzmann Distribution, or Tiltings as the Unique Support-Preserving Convolution Endomorphisms
Authors: Fedor Sandomirskiy, Omer Tamuz
Abstract: The family of Boltzmann distributions is used in statistical mechanics to describe the distribution of states in systems with a given temperature. We give a novel characterization of this family as the unique one satisfying independence for uncoupled systems. The theorem boils down to a statement about endomorphisms of the convolution semigroup of finitely supported probability measures on the natural numbers, or, alternatively, about endomorphisms of the multiplicative semigroup of polynomials with non-negative coefficients.

Title: On the Conditions for a Quantum Violent Relaxation
Authors: Guido Giachetti, Nicolò Defenu
Abstract: In general, classical fully-connected systems are known to undergo violent relaxation. This phenomenon refers to the relaxation of observables to stationary, non-thermal, values on a finite timescale, despite their long-time dynamics being dominated by mean-field effects in the thermodynamic limit. Here, we analyze the ``quantum" violent relaxation by studying the dynamics of generic many-body systems with two-body, all-to-all, interactions in the thermodynamic limit. We show that, in order for violent relaxation to occur very specific conditions on the spectrum of the mean-field effective Hamiltonian have to be met. These conditions are hardly met and ``quantum" violent relaxation is observed rarely with respect to its classical counterpart. Our predictions are validated by the study of a spin model which, depending on the value of the coupling, shows a transition between violent-relaxation and a generic prethermal phase. We also analyze a spin version of the quantum Hamiltonian-Mean-Field model, which is shown not to exhibit violent-relaxation. Finally, we discuss how the violent-relaxation picture emerges back in the classical limit. Our results demonstrate how, even in the mean-field regime, quantum effects have a rather dramatic impact on the dynamics, paving the way to a better understanding of light-matter coupled systems.

Title: Local topology for periodic Hamiltonians and fuzzy tori
Authors: Nora Doll, Terry Loring, Hermann Schulz-Baldes
Abstract: A variety of local index formulas is constructed for quantum Hamiltonians with periodic boundary conditions. All dimensions of physical space as well as many symmetry constraints are covered, notably one-dimensional systems in Class DIII as well as two- and three-dimensional systems in Class AII. The constructions are based on several periodic variations of the spectral localizer and are rooted in the existence of underlying fuzzy tori. For these latter, a general invariant theory is developed.

Title: Self-referencing photothermal common-path interferometry to measure absorption of Si3N4 membranes for laser-light sails
Authors: Tanuj Kumar, Demeng Feng, Shenwei Yin, Merlin Mah, Phyo Lin, Margaret Fortman, Gabriel R. Jaffe, Chenghao Wan, Hongyan Mei, Yuzhe Xiao, Ron Synowicki, Ronald J. Warzoha, Victor W. Brar, Joseph J. Talghader, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: Laser-light sails are a spacecraft concept wherein lightweight "sails" are propelled by high-intensity lasers. We investigated the near-infrared absorption of free-standing membranes of stoichiometric silicon nitride (Si$_3$N$_4$), a candidate sail material. To resolve the small but non-zero optical loss, we used photothermal common-path interferometry (PCI), for which we developed a self-referencing modality where a PCI measurement is performed twice: once on a bare membrane, and a second time with monolayer graphene deposited on the membrane. The graphene increases the absorption of the sample by orders of magnitude, such that it can be measured by ellipsometry, without significantly affecting the thermal properties. We measured the absorption coefficient of Si$_3$N$_4$ to be (1.5-3) $\times$ 10$^{-2}$ cm$^{-1}$ at 1064 nm, making it a suitable sail material for laser intensities as high as ~10 GW/m$^2$. By comparison, silicon-rich "low stress" SiN$_x$ (x~1), with a measured absorption coefficient of approximately 8 cm$^{-1}$, is unlikely to survive such high laser intensities. Our self-referencing technique enables testing of low-loss membranes of various materials for laser sails and other applications.

Title: Measurement-induced phase transition in free bosons
Authors: Kazuki Yokomizo, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: The competition between quantum many-particle dynamics and continuous monitoring can lead to measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). So far, MIPTs have been extensively explored in fermionic or spin systems. To examine the possibility of an MIPT in bosonic systems, we study the entanglement structure in continuously monitored free bosons with long-range couplings. When the measurement is local, we find that no MIPTs occur because the substantial entanglement generated by the long-range coupling overcomes the entanglement destruction due to the measurement. In contrast, we show that the nonlocal measurement can efficiently suppress the entanglement generation, leading to an MIPT where the bipartite entanglement entropy exhibits the subvolume-to-area law phase transition as the measurement strength is increased. Our numerical results indicate that the critical point should be described by a certain conformal field theory, while the transition does not belong to a conventional universality class such as Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless class.

Title: Feature learning in finite-width Bayesian deep linear networks with multiple outputs and convolutional layers
Authors: Federico Bassetti, Marco Gherardi, Alessandro Ingrosso, Mauro Pastore, Pietro Rotondo
Abstract: Deep linear networks have been extensively studied, as they provide simplified models of deep learning. However, little is known in the case of finite-width architectures with multiple outputs and convolutional layers. In this manuscript, we provide rigorous results for the statistics of functions implemented by the aforementioned class of networks, thus moving closer to a complete characterization of feature learning in the Bayesian setting. Our results include: (i) an exact and elementary non-asymptotic integral representation for the joint prior distribution over the outputs, given in terms of a mixture of Gaussians; (ii) an analytical formula for the posterior distribution in the case of squared error loss function (Gaussian likelihood); (iii) a quantitative description of the feature learning infinite-width regime, using large deviation theory. From a physical perspective, deep architectures with multiple outputs or convolutional layers represent different manifestations of kernel shape renormalization, and our work provides a dictionary that translates this physics intuition and terminology into rigorous Bayesian statistics.

Title: Breakdown of Measurement-Induced Phase Transitions Under Information Loss
Authors: Alessio Paviglianiti, Giovanni Di Fresco, Alessandro Silva, Bernardo Spagnolo, Davide Valenti, Angelo Carollo
Abstract: The dynamics of a quantum-many body system subject to measurements is naturally described by an ensemble of quantum trajectories, which can feature measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs). This phenomenon cannot be revealed through ensemble-averaged observables, but it requires the ability to discriminate each trajectory separately, making its experimental observation extremely challenging. We explore the fate of MIPTs under an observer's reduced ability to discriminate each measurement outcome. This introduces uncertainty in the state of the system, causing observables to probe a restricted subset of trajectories rather than a single one. By introducing an exactly-solvable Liouvillian model, we examine how long-time spatial correlations are influenced by varying degrees of trajectory averaging. We compute exactly the correlation matrix, Liouvillian gap, and entanglement negativity to demonstrate that averaging over multiple realizations introduces an effective finite lengthscale, beyond which long-range correlations are suppressed. This suggests that partial averaging over trajectories conceals the critical features of individual realizations, thereby blurring away the signatures of distinct measurement-induced phases.

Title: Continuous generation of confined bubbles: viscous effect on the gravito-capillary pinch off
Authors: Haruka Hitomi, Ko Okumura
Abstract: We investigate continuous generation of bubbles from a bath of air in viscous liquid in a confined geometry. In our original setup, bubbles are spontaneously generated by virtue of buoyancy and a gate placed in the cell: the gate acts like an inverted funnel trapping air beneath it before continuously generating bubbles at the tip. The dynamics is characterized by the bubble-formation period and the bubble size as a function of the amount of air under the gate. By analyzing the data obtained for various parameters, we clearly identified that the dynamics of the bubble formation is governed by dissipation in the viscous fluid beneath the trapped air balanced by a gravitational energy change due to buoyancy, after examining numerous possibilities of dissipation, which demonstrates the potential of scaling analysis even in complex cases. Furthermore, we uncover a novel type of pinch-off condition, which convincingly explains the bubble size: in the present case viscosity plays a vital role, different from the conventional mechanism of Tate, in which gravity competes with capillarity, revealing a general mechanism of pinching-off at low Reynolds number. Accordingly, the present study significantly and fundamentally advances our knowledge of generation and pinch-off of bubbles, with the results relevant for a wide variety of applications in many fields. In particular, the present study demonstrates a promising avenue in microfluidics for understanding physical principles by scaling up the system, without losing the characteristics of the flow at low Reynolds numbers.

Title: Entanglement scaling and criticality of infinite-size quantum many-body systems in continuous space addressed by a tensor network approach
Authors: Rui Hong, Hao-Wei Cui, An-Chun Ji, Shi-Ju Ran
Abstract: Simulating strongly-correlated quantum systems in continuous space belongs to the most challenging and long-concerned issues in quantum physics. This work investigates the quantum entanglement and criticality of the ground-state wave-functions of infinitely-many coupled quantum oscillators (iCQOs). The essential task involves solving a set of partial differential equations (Schrödinger equations in the canonical quantization picture) with infinitely-many variables, which currently lacks valid methods. By extending the imaginary-time evolution algorithm with translationally-invariant functional tensor network, we simulate the ground state of iCQOs with the presence of two- and three-body couplings. We determine the range of coupling strengths where there exists a real ground-state energy (dubbed as physical region). With two-body couplings, we reveal the logarithmic scaling law of entanglement entropy (EE) and the polynomial scaling law of correlation length against the virtual bond dimension $\chi$ at the dividing point of physical and non-physical regions. These two scaling behaviors are signatures of criticality, according to the previous results in quantum lattice models, but were not reported in continuous-space quantum systems. The scaling coefficients result in a central charge $c=1$, indicating the presence of free boson conformal field theory (CFT). We further show that the presence of three-body couplings, for which there are no analytical or numerical results, breaks down the CFT description at the dividing point. Our work reveals the scaling behaviors of EE in continuous-space quantum many-body systems. These results provide strong numerical evidence supporting the efficiency of TN in representing continuous-space quantum wave-functions in the thermodynamic limit and offer an efficient approach to studying entanglement properties and criticality in continuous space.

Title: Generalizing the matching decoder for the Chamon code
Authors: Zohar Schwartzman-Nowik, Benjamin J. Brown
Abstract: Different choices of quantum error-correcting codes can reduce the demands on the physical hardware needed to build a quantum computer. To achieve the full potential of a code, we must develop practical decoding algorithms that can correct errors that have occurred with high likelihood. Matching decoders are very good at correcting local errors while also demonstrating fast run times that can keep pace with physical quantum devices. We implement variations of a matching decoder for a three-dimensional, non-CSS, low-density parity check code known as the Chamon code, which has a non-trivial structure that does not lend itself readily to this type of decoding. The non-trivial structure of the syndrome of this code means that we can supplement the decoder with additional steps to improve the threshold error rate, below which the logical failure rate decreases with increasing code distance. We find that a generalized matching decoder that is augmented by a belief-propagation step prior to matching gives a threshold of 10.5% for depolarizing noise.

Title: Gauge fields induced by curved spacetime
Authors: Pasquale Marra
Abstract: I found an extended duality (triality) between Dirac fermions in periodic spacetime metrics, nonrelativistic fermions in gauge fields (e.g., Harper-Hofstadter model), and in periodic scalar fields on a lattice (e.g., Aubry-André model). This indicates an unexpected equivalence between spacetime metrics, gauge fields, and scalar fields on the lattice, which is understood as different physical representations of the same mathematical object, the quantum group $\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{sl}_2)$. This quantum group is generated by the exponentiation of two canonical conjugate operators, namely a linear combination of position and momentum (periodic spacetime metrics), the two components of the gauge invariant momentum (gauge fields), position and momentum (periodic scalar fields). Hence, on a lattice, Dirac fermions in a periodic spacetime metric are equivalent to nonrelativistic fermions in a periodic scalar field after a proper canonical transformation. The three lattice Hamiltonians (periodic spacetime metric, Harper-Hofstadter, and Aubry-André) share the same properties, namely fractal phase diagrams, self-similarity, topological invariants, flat bands, and topologically quantized current in the incommensurate regimes. This work unveils an unexpected link between gravity and gauge fields, opens new venues for studying analog gravity, e.g., the Unruh effect and universe expansions/contractions, and hints at novel pathways to quantized gravity theories.

Title: Deep Linear Network Training Dynamics from Random Initialization: Data, Width, Depth, and Hyperparameter Transfer
Authors: Blake Bordelon, Cengiz Pehlevan
Abstract: We theoretically characterize gradient descent dynamics in deep linear networks trained at large width from random initialization and on large quantities of random data. Our theory captures the ``wider is better" effect of mean-field/maximum-update parameterized networks as well as hyperparameter transfer effects, which can be contrasted with the neural-tangent parameterization where optimal learning rates shift with model width. We provide asymptotic descriptions of both non-residual and residual neural networks, the latter of which enables an infinite depth limit when branches are scaled as $1/\sqrt{\text{depth}}$. We also compare training with one-pass stochastic gradient descent to the dynamics when training data are repeated at each iteration. Lastly, we show that this model recovers the accelerated power law training dynamics for power law structured data in the rich regime observed in recent works.

Title: Quantum null energy condition in quenched 2d CFTs
Authors: Tanay Kibe, Pratik Roy
Abstract: The quantum null energy condition (QNEC) is a lower bound on the expectation value of the null-null component of the energy-momentum tensor in terms of null variations of the entanglement entropy. A stronger version of the QNEC (the primary QNEC) is expected to hold in 1+1 dimensional conformal field theories (CFT). QNEC has been shown to impose non-trivial quantum thermodynamic restrictions on irreversible entropy production in quenches in 1+1 dimensional holographic CFTs. It is therefore natural to study if QNEC imposes similar bounds in other quench setups. In this paper we study QNEC in the Calabrese-Cardy global and local joining quenches using standard CFT techniques. In the global quench we show that the primary QNEC must hold at sufficiently early times and find that it imposes bounds on the four point correlators of twist fields in a boundary state. This is a constraint on the set of boundary states that satisfy the primary QNEC. Furthermore, we find that a violation of the primary QNEC implies a violation of the averaged null energy condition (ANEC) in a conformally transformed frame. In the local quench we find similar bounds on four point correlators from both the primary and the usual QNEC.

Title: Subexponential decay of local correlations from diffusion-limited dephasing
Authors: Ewan McCulloch, J. Alexander Jacoby, Curt von Keyserlingk, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: Chaotic quantum systems at finite energy density are expected to act as their own heat baths, rapidly dephasing local quantum superpositions. We argue that in fact this dephasing is subexponential for chaotic dynamics with conservation laws in one spatial dimension: all local correlation functions decay as stretched exponentials or slower. The stretched exponential bound is saturated for operators that are orthogonal to all hydrodynamic modes. This anomalous decay is a quantum coherent effect, which lies beyond standard fluctuating hydrodynamics; it vanishes in the presence of extrinsic dephasing. Our arguments are general, subject principally to the assumption that there exist zero-entropy charge sectors (such as the particle vacuum) with no nontrivial dynamics: slow relaxation is due to the persistence of regions resembling these inert vacua, which we term "voids". In systems with energy conservation, this assumption is automatically satisfied because of the third law of thermodynamics.

Title: Cell size heterogeneity controls crystallization of the developing fruit fly wing
Authors: Kartik Chhajed, Franz S. Gruber, Natalie A. Dye, Frank Jülicher, Marko Popović
Abstract: A fundamental question in Biology is to understand how patterns and shapes emerge from the collective interplay of large numbers of cells. Cells forming two-dimensional epithelial tissues behave as active materials that undergo remodeling and spontaneous shape changes. Focussing on the fly wing as a model system, we find that the cellular packing in the wing epithelium transitions from a disordered packing to an ordered, crystalline packing. We investigate biophysical mechanisms controlling this crystallization process. While previous studies propose a role of tissue shear flow in establishing the ordered cell packing in the fly wing, we reveal a role of cell size heterogeneity. Indeed, we find that even if tissue shear have been inhibited, cell packings in the fruit fly wing epithelium transition from disordered to an ordered packing. We propose that the transition is controlled by the cell size heterogeneity, which is quantified by the cell size polydispersity. We use the vertex model of epithelial tissues to show that there is a critical value of cell size polydispersity above which cellular packings are disordered and below which they form a crystalline packing. By analyzing experimental data we find that cell size polydispersity decreases during fly wing development. The observed dynamics of tissue crystallisation is consistent with the slow ordering kinetics we observe in the vertex model. Therefore, although tissue shear does not control the transition, it significantly enhances the rate of tissue scale ordering by facilitating alingment of locally ordered crystallites.

Title: Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies
Authors: Andrea Corazza, Silvia Ruffieux, Yuchun Zhu, Claudio A. Jaramillo Concha, Yannik Fontana, Christophe Galland, Richard J. Warburton, Patrick Maletinsky
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mathrm{\mu m}$}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.
