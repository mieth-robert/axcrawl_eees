Title: Hermitian and Non-Hermitian Topological Transitions Characterized by Manifold Distance
Authors: ZhaoXiang Fang, Ming Gong, Guang-Can Guo, Yongxu Fu, Long Xiong
Abstract: Topological phases are generally characterized by topological invariants denoted by integer numbers. However, different topological systems often require different topological invariants to measure, and theses definition usually fail at critical points. Therefore, it's challenging to predict what would occur during the transformation between two different topological phases. To address these issues, we propose a general definition based on fidelity and trace distance from quantum information theory: manifold distance (MD). This definition does not rely on the berry connection but rather on the information of the two manifolds - their ground state wave functions. Thus, it can measure different topological systems (including traditional band topology models, non-Hermitian systems, and gapless systems, etc.) and exhibit some universal laws during the transformation between two topological phases. Our research demonstrates for different topological manifolds, the change rate (first-order derivative) or susceptibility (second-order derivative) of MD exhibit various divergent behaviors near the critical points. Compared to the strange correlator, which could be used as a diagnosis for short-range entangled states in 1D and 2D, MD is more universal and could be applied to non-Hermitian systems and long-range entangled states. For subsequent studies, we expect the method to be generalized to real-space or non-lattice models, in order to facilitate the study of a wider range of physical platforms such as open systems and many-body localization.

Title: Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient: New Approach to Study Auxetic Piezoelectric Harvesters
Authors: Grégoire Forges (SYMME, IMS), David Gibus (SYMME), Adrien Morel (SYMME), Adrien Badel (SYMME), Héléne Debéda (IMS)
Abstract: This work introduces a novel methodology to assess the performance of Piezoelectric Energy Harvesters (PEHs) in order to study auxetic enhancement possibilities. For this purpose, a new approach for evaluating the intrinsic effective Electromechanical Coupling Coefficient (EMCC) of piezoelectric layers is presented. As the current assessment methods are questioned under resonance exposures, theoretical models are presented to suggest what characteristics the harvested power will depend on. A two axis graph is introduced to enable the comparison of different PEHs. The method is finally applied to PEHs with different types of substrates: filled, hollow and auxetic. First results show that, generally, auxetic structures might not increase the intrinsic EMCC but only improve the elastic energy ratio in the piezoelectric layers.

Title: A novel BPS bound with a first order BPS system in the $2D$ Gross-Pitaevskii equation
Authors: Fabrizio Canfora, Pablo Pais
Abstract: A novel BPS bound for the Gross-Pitaevskii equations in two spatial dimensions is presented. The energy can be bound from below in terms of the combination of two boundary terms, one related to the vorticity (but ``dressed'' by the condensate profile) and the second to the ``skewness'' of the configurations. The bound is saturated by configurations which satisfy a system of two first-order PDE: when such BPS system is satisfied, the Gross-Pitaevskii equations are satisfied as well. The analytic solutions of this BPS system constructed in the present manuscript represent configurations with fractional vorticity living in an annulus. Using these techniques, we present the first analytic examples of this kind. The hydrodynamical interpretation of the BPS system is discussed. The implications of these results are outlined.

Title: Nonlinear phononics in Bi$_2$Te$_3$ from first-principles
Authors: A. Levchuk, R. Busselez, G. Vaudel, P. Ruello, V. Juvé, B. Arnaud
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations not only allow to predict the vibrational and optical properties of solids but also to understand and disentangle the mechanisms playing a key role in the generation of coherent optical phonons. Recent experiments performed on a Bi$_2$Te$_3$ nanofilm have shown that a THz pulse launches at least a coherent $A_{1g}^1$ phonon as the transient transmittance measured using an isotropic detection scheme displays oscillations with a frequency matching the frequency of the $A_{1g}^1$ mode measured in Raman experiments. Such an observation can be explained by invoking either a sum frequency process or cubic/quartic phonon-phonon couplings as considered for Bi$_2$Se$_3$, a parent compound of Bi$_2$Te$_3$. By resorting to group theory and calculating energy surfaces from first-principles, the main phonon-phonon couplings can be identified. Furthermore, a minimal model can be built to compute the dynamics of the Raman active modes coupled to the infrared active mode driven by the experimental THz pulse. Our model firmly establishes that cubic phonon-phonon interactions are relevant as the agreement between the computed and experimental transmittance is noteworthy.

Title: Capturing spin-torque effects with a semilocal exchange-correlation functional
Authors: Marie-Therese Huebsch, Fabien Tran, Martijn Marsman
Abstract: We cure the lack of spin torque in semilocal exchange-correlation (XC) functionals by treating XC effects in the framework of spin-current-density-functional theory (SCDFT), and present the implementation of the first kind of this novel family of XC functionals in the Vienna ab-initio simulation package (VASP): An SCDFT functional featuring a U(1)$\times$SU(2) gauge-invariant $2\times 2$ XC potential. While the framework can be applied to other XC functionals, the presented flavor of the SCDFT functional is based on Becke-Roussel exchange and Colle-Salvetti correlation. In addition to the $2\times 2$ spin density and kinetic-energy density, the XC functional depends on the $2\times 2$ spin-current density. The implementation requires the computation of the spin-current density within the projector-augmented-wave method and the variation of the XC energy with respect to it. The application to a Cr$_3$ molecule and bulk MnO reveals (i) spin torque of the same order as obtained by methods including exact exchange, (ii) a counterintuitive contribution to the energy even in collinear ferromagnetic systems without spin-orbit coupling due to the gradient of the magnetization, and (iii) a similar computational cost per electronic step as calculations that depend on, inter alia, the kinetic-energy density, but convergence within fewer electronic steps.

Title: Exploiting Instabilities to Enable Large Shape Transformations in Dielectric Elastomers
Authors: Daniel Katusele, Carmel Majidi, Pradeep Sharma, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Dielectric elastomers have significant potential for new technologies ranging from soft robots to biomedical devices, driven by their ability to display complex shape changes in response to electrical stimulus. However, an important shortcoming of current realizations is that large voltages are required for useful actuation strains. This work proposes, and demonstrates through theory and numerical simulations, a strategy to achieve large and controlled actuation by exploiting the electromechanical analog of the Treloar-Kearsley (TK) instability. The key idea is to use the fact that the TK instability is a symmetry-breaking bifurcation, which implies the existence of a symmetry-driven constant-energy region in the energy landscape. This provides for nonlinear soft modes with large deformations that can be accessed with very small external stimulus, which is achieved here by applying a small in-plane electric field. First, the bifurcation and post-bifurcation behavior of the electromechanical TK instability are established theoretically in the idealized setting of uniform deformation and electric field. Next, building on this, a finite element analysis of a realistic geometry with patterned top and bottom electrodes is applied to demonstrate large and soft shape changes driven by small voltage differences across the electrodes.

Title: Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Matteo Ceccanti, Bianca Turini, Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Marco Schiró, Frank H.L. Koppens
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.

Title: Machine Learning for Identifying Grain Boundaries in Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) Images of Nanoparticle Superlattices
Authors: Aanish Paruchuri, Carl Thrasher, A. J. Hart, Robert Macfarlane, Arthi Jayaraman
Abstract: Nanoparticle superlattices consisting of ordered arrangements of nanoparticles exhibit unique optical, magnetic, and electronic properties arising from nanoparticle characteristics as well as their collective behaviors. Understanding how processing conditions influence the nanoscale arrangement and microstructure is critical for engineering materials with desired macroscopic properties. Microstructural features such as grain boundaries, lattice defects, and pores significantly affect these properties but are challenging to quantify using traditional manual analyses as they are labor-intensive and prone to errors. In this work, we present a machine learning workflow for automating grain segmentation in scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of nanoparticle superlattices. This workflow integrates signal processing techniques, such as Radon transforms, with unsupervised learning methods like agglomerative hierarchical clustering to identify and segment grains without requiring manually annotated data. In the workflow we transform the raw pixel data into explainable numerical representation of superlattice orientations for clustering. Benchmarking results demonstrate the workflow's robustness against noisy images and edge cases, with a processing speed of four images per minute on standard computational hardware. This efficiency makes the workflow scalable to large datasets and makes it a valuable tool for integrating data-driven models into decision-making processes for material design and analysis. For example, one can use this workflow to quantify grain size distributions at varying processing conditions like temperature and pressure and using that knowledge adjust processing conditions to achieve desired superlattice orientations and grain sizes.

Title: Multichannel Dyson equations for even- and odd-order Green's functions: application to double excitations
Authors: Gabriele Riva, Théodore Fischer, Stefano Paggi, J. Arjan Berger, Pina Romaniello
Abstract: We extend the concept of the multichannel Dyson equation that we have recently derived to model photoemission spectra by coupling the one- and the three-body Green's functions, to higher-order Green's functions and to other spectroscopies. We show the general structure of the equations and how one can systematically approximate the corresponding multichannel self-energy. As a particular case, we focus on the coupling of the two-body and the four-body Green's functions in the electron-hole channel to describe neutral excitations. This formulation allows for the description of important many-body effects, such biexcitons, in a natural way. We illustrate our approach by applying it to a two-level model system, which, in a one-particle picture, exhibits single and double excitations. Our method can correctly describe both kinds of excitation, unlike standard approaches, and in good agreement with the exact results.

Title: Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl Semimetal films with surface engineering
Authors: M. H. Zou, H. Geng, R. Ma, W. Chen, L. Sheng, D. Y. Xing
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films possess unique electronic properties that differ from bulk materials. In this article, we study the nonreciprocal ballistic transport of the WSM thin films caused by surface modification. We find that the surface states contribute predominantly to the nonreciprocity, while the bulk states provide a negative correction. Our calculation shows a kind of quantum size effect that the nonreciprocal signal decreases as the WSM film becomes thicker, and diverges when the Fermi energy is near the bottom of a sub-band. On the other hand, it is found that the density of states in multi-layer systems possesses some properties roughly independent of thickness. A single-variable theory is developed to explain it

Title: Interleaved bond and magnetic frustration in triangular lattice $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$
Authors: S. J. Gomez Alvarado, J. R. Chamorro, A. R. Jackson, G. Pokharel, R. Gomez, B. R. Ortiz, Suchismita Sarker, L. Kautzsch, L. C. Gallington, R. Seshadri, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: We report the presence of frustrated bond order in the form of short-range charge correlations in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that separate tetrahedral CdP$_4$ layers; collectively, these sandwich edge-sharing triangular lattice planes of $Ln$P$_6$ octahedra. Diffuse X-ray scattering data reveal an underlying bond instability within the unique CdP$_3$ units that breaks rotational symmetry along one Cd$-$P bond direction, with long-range ordering being frustrated via emergent kagome-ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.

Title: Skin-inspired in-sensor encoding of strain vector using tunable quantum geometry
Authors: Zenglin Liu, Jingwen Shi, Jin Cao, Zecheng Ma, Zaizheng Yang, Yanwei Cui, Lizheng Wang, Yudi Dai, Moyu Chen, Pengfei Wang, Yongqin Xie, Fanqiang Chen, Youguo Shi, Cong Xiao, Shengyuan A. Yang, Bin Cheng, Shi-Jun Liang, Feng Miao
Abstract: Human skin provides crucial tactile feedback, allowing us to skillfully perceive various objects by sensing and encoding complex deformations through multiple parameters in each tactile receptor. However, replicating this high-dimensional tactile perception with conventional materials' electronic properties remains a daunting challenge. Here, we present a skin-inspired method to encode strain vectors directly within a sensor. This is achieved by leveraging the strain-tunable quantum properties of electronic bands in the van der Waals topological semimetal Td -WTe2. We observe robust and independent responses from the second-order and third-order nonlinear Hall signals in Td -WTe2 when subjected to variations in both the magnitude and direction of strain. Through rigorous temperature-dependent measurements and scaling law analysis, we establish that these strain responses primarily stem from quantum geometry-related phenomena, including the Berry curvature and Berry-connection polarizability tensor. Furthermore, our study demonstrates that the strain-dependent nonlinear Hall signals can efficiently encode high-dimensional strain information using a single device. This capability enables accurate and comprehensive sensing of complex strain patterns in the embossed character "NJU". Our findings highlight the promising application of topological quantum materials in advancing next-generation, bio-inspired flexible electronics.

Title: Tilted chiral spin textures in confined nanostructures with in-plane magnetic anisotropy
Authors: Wenlei Fu, Haiming Dong, Kai Chang
Abstract: We demonstrate that nanoconfinement effects and in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA) can lead to tilted chiral spin textures in magnetic nanostructures, based on the analysis and simulation of theoretical models of micromagnetism. The tilted skyrmions are induced in confined nanoscale magnets with IMA under perpendicular magnetic fields. The chiral magnetic structures depend significantly on the size of the nanostructures. A controlled string of periodic skyrmion states emerges within the central magnetic domain wall, which can be tuned by the steady magnetic fields and the size of the nanostructures. Non-trivial topological states with non-integer topological charges are achieved by tuning the magnetic fields or the sizes of the nanostructures. Importantly, the periodic switching between the trivial and the non-trivial topological configurations is realized using an alternating magnetic field. Our study reveals an important mechanism for controlling novel skyrmion states via nanoconfinement effects and the IMA in magnetic nanostructures, and also provides a new approach for the development of magnetic field-modulated spin nanodevices.

Title: Novel magnetic-field-free switching behavior in vdW-magnet/oxide heterostructure
Authors: Jihoon Keum, Kai-Xuan Zhang, Suik Cheon, Hyuncheol Kim, Jingyuan Cui, Giung Park, Yunyeong Chang, Miyoung Kim, Hyun-Woo Lee, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Magnetization switching by charge current without a magnetic field is essential for device applications and information technology. It generally requires a current-induced out-of-plane spin polarization beyond the capability of conventional ferromagnet/heavy-metal systems, where the current-induced spin polarization aligns in-plane orthogonal to the in-plane charge current and out-of-plane spin current. Here, we demonstrate a new approach for magnetic-field-free switching by fabricating a van-der-Waals magnet and oxide Fe3GeTe2/SrTiO3 heterostructure. This new magnetic-field-free switching is possible because the current-driven accumulated spins at the Rashba interface precess around an emergent interface magnetism, eventually producing an ultimate out-of-plane spin polarization. This interpretation is further confirmed by the switching polarity change controlled by the in-plane initialization magnetic fields with clear hysteresis. We successfully combined van-der-Waals magnet and oxide for the first time, especially taking advantage of spin-orbit torque on the SrTiO3 oxide. This allows us to establish a new way of magnetic field-free switching. Our work demonstrates an unusual perpendicular switching application of large spin Hall angle materials and precession of accumulated spins, and in doing so, opens up a new field and opportunities for van-der-Waals magnets and oxide spintronics.

Title: High-Throughput Studies of Novel Magnetic Materials in Borides
Authors: Zhen Zhang, Kirill D. Belashchenko, Vladimir Antropov
Abstract: Borides are a versatile material family with various properties for valuable applications. Conventional magnetism, such as ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism in borides, have been extensively studied. However, research on unconventional magnetism in borides where quantum effects are dominant is scarce. Here, we implement a high-throughput workflow combining first-principles calculations, materials prediction, and magnetic properties calculations to discover novel magnetism and magnetic materials in borides. Successfully applying the workflow, we report three families of novel magnetic borides, including two families of borides exhibiting quantum magnetism. One is a family of dimerized quantum magnets among YCrB$_4$-type borides, which provides a rare platform for studying the spin-gap quantum critical point. The other is a family of altermagnets among FeMo$_2$B$_2$-type borides, extending the magnetic orderings exhibited by borides beyond conventional ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. We also predict a family of magnetic laminate transition metal borides, known as the MAB phases, in the AlFe$_2$B$_2$-type family, which provide pure-phase or alloying candidates for studying magnetocaloric materials and the associated magnetic transitions. The workflow is expected to be used in further studies of novel magnetism and magnetic materials.

Title: The electronic structure, crystal fields, and magnetic anisotropy in RECo$_5$ magnets
Authors: Zhen Zhang, Andrey Kutepov, Leonid Pourovskii, Vladimir Antropov
Abstract: The current progress in the description of the electronic structure and magnetic properties of rare-earth-based magnets is discussed. We show the typical values of critical parameters that define the physics of these materials for RECo$_5$ (RE = rare earth atom) using several currently popular electronic structure methods. The magnetic moments and magnetic anisotropy of 4\textit{f} atoms are obtained using several different approaches, including the total energy in constrained DFT and crystal field theory in DFT+HI methods. We also propose a Hund's rule constrained density functional method for the studies of the ground and excited states of magnets containing rare earth atoms. The method is applied to the RECo$_5$ family of magnets. The applicability and future extensions are discussed. The technique is suitable for high-throughput computational searches of new rare-earth-containing magnetic materials.

Title: Defect Phonon Renormalization during Nonradiative Multiphonon Transitions in Semiconductors
Authors: Junjie Zhou, Shanshan Wang, Menglin Huang, Xin-Gao Gong, Shiyou Chen
Abstract: As a typical nonradiative multiphonon transition in semiconductors, carrier capture at defects is critical to the performance of semiconductor devices. Its transition rate is usually calculated using the equal-mode approximation, which assumes that phonon modes and frequencies remain unchanged before and after the transition. Using the carbon substitutional defect ($\text{C}_\text{N}$) in GaN as a benchmark, here we demonstrate that the phonon renormalization can be significant during defect relaxation, which causes errors as large as orders of magnitude in the approximation. To address this issue, we consider (i) Duschinsky matrix connecting the initial-state and final-state phonons, which accounts for the changes in phonon modes and frequencies; and (ii) the off-diagonal contributions in total transition matrix element, which incorporates the cross terms of electron-phonon interactions between different modes. With this improvement, the calculated transition rates show agreements with experimental results within an order of magnitude. We believe the present method makes one step forward for the accurate calculation of multiphonon transition rate, especially in cases with large defect relaxations.

Title: Anisotropy of PbTe nanowires with and without a superconductor
Authors: Zonglin Li, Wenyu Song, Shan Zhang, Yuhao Wang, Zhaoyu Wang, Zehao Yu, Ruidong Li, Zeyu Yan, Jiaye Xu, Yichun Gao, Shuai Yang, Lining Yang, Xiao Feng, Tiantian Wang, Yunyi Zang, Lin Li, Runan Shang, Qi-Kun Xue, Ke He, Hao Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the anisotropic behaviors in PbTe and PbTe-Pb hybrid nanowires. In previous studies on PbTe, wire-to-wire variations in anisotropy indicate poor device control, posing a serious challenge for applications. Here, we achieve reproducible anisotropy in PbTe nanowires through a substantial reduction of disorder. We then couple PbTe to a superconductor Pb, and observe a pronounced deviation in the anisotropy behavior compared to bare PbTe nanowires. This deviation is gate-tunable and attributed to spin-orbit interaction and orbital effect, controlled by charge transfer between Pb and PbTe. These results provide a guidance for the controlled engineering of exotic quantum states in this hybrid material platform.

Title: Observation of topological Anderson Chern insulator phase in MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ monolayer

Abstract: The correlation of topology and disorder has attracted great intention due to appropriate disorder could induce the phase transition between trivial and nontrivial topological states. While it is widely recognized that strong disorder can produce rich phase diagrams in topological nontrivial states, moderate disorder has been proposed to induce transitions into topologically nontrivial phases counter-intuitively, leading to the concept of topological Anderson insulators. This phenomenon has been theoretically explored and simulated in various systems, yet experimental realization in solid state systems has remained elusive due to challenges in controlling disorder. Here, we report the experimental observation of Chern insulator state signed by the coexistence of quantized Hall plateau and zero longitudinal resistance in monolayer MnBi$_4$Te$_7$ Hall bar device, which originally hosts a trivial insulating state with Chern number $C$ = 0 in clean limit. We demonstrate that the observed trivial to nontrivial transition in this monolayer device can be attributed to disorder, evidenced by universal conductance fluctuations. Our findings substantiate the existence of a long-sought topological Anderson Chern insulator in real materials, a unique variant of the topological Anderson insulator characterized by broken time-reversal-symmetry.

Title: The unbearable lightness of Restricted Boltzmann Machines: Theoretical Insights and Biological Applications
Authors: Giovanni di Sarra, Barbara Bravi, Yasser Roudi
Abstract: Restricted Boltzmann Machines are simple yet powerful neural networks. They can be used for learning structure in data, and are used as a building block of more complex neural architectures. At the same time, their simplicity makes them easy to use, amenable to theoretical analysis, yielding interpretable models in applications. Here, we focus on reviewing the role that the activation functions, describing the input-output relationship of single neurons in RBM, play in the functionality of these models. We discuss recent theoretical results on the benefits and limitations of different activation functions. We also review applications to biological data analysis, namely neural data analysis, where RBM units are mostly taken to have sigmoid activation functions and binary units, to protein data analysis and immunology where non-binary units and non-sigmoid activation functions have recently been shown to yield important insights into the data. Finally, we discuss open problems addressing which can shed light on broader issues in neural network research.

Title: Comparison of bulk properties of wet granular materials using different capillary force approximations
Authors: Meysam Bagheri, Sudeshna Roy, Thorsten Pöschel
Abstract: We perform Discrete Element Method simulations of wet granular matter in a split-bottom shear cell. To calculate the capillary forces from the liquid bridges between the grains, we used three different approximations. The simulations of the shear cell showed a linear increase in bulk cohesion with the surface tension of the liquid, consistently for all approximations. However, the macroscopic friction coefficient shows only a weak dependence on surface tension.

Title: Fate of gapless edge states in two-dimensional topological insulators with Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction
Authors: Jan Skolimowski, Wojciech Brzezicki
Abstract: Topologically protected edge states are the highlight feature of an interface between non-equivalent insulators. The robustness/sensitivity of these states to local single-particle perturbations is well understood, while their stability in the presence of various types of two-particle interactions remains unclear. To add to previous discussions of the Hubbard and unscreened Coulomb interactions, we address this problem from the point of view of infinite-range Hatsugai-Kohmoto interaction. Based on our numerical results for two models of Chern insulators, the Kane-Mele and spinful Haldane model, on a ribbon geometry with zig-zag edges, we argue that any finite interaction strength $U$ is sufficient to open a charge gap in the spectrum of either Chern insulator. We explain the differences between the two cases and present how their edge states phase out as the system enters the strongly correlated phase. We show that the closing of the many-body gap in periodic variants of these models can be connected to the onset of hybridization between the edge and bulk modes in finite geometries. Providing an example of the bulk-boundary correspondence in systems where there is a topological phase transition without closing of the spectral gap.

Title: Hypersonic acoustic wave control via hyperuniform phononic nanostructures
Authors: Michele Diego, Jade Hardouin, Gabrielle Mazevet-Schargrod, Matteo Pirro, Byunggi Kim, Roman Anufriev, Masahiro Nomura
Abstract: Controlling hypersonic surface acoustic waves is crucial for advanced phononic devices such as high-frequency filters, sensors, and quantum computing components. While periodic phononic crystals enable precise bandgap engineering, their ability to suppress acoustic waves is limited to specific frequency ranges. Here, we experimentally demonstrate the control of surface acoustic waves using a hyperuniform arrangement of gold nanopillars on a lithium niobate layer. The hyperuniform structure exhibits characteristics of both random and ordered systems, leading to an overall reduction in acoustic transmission and the formation of bandgap-like regions where phonon propagation is strongly suppressed. We further demonstrate effective waveguiding by incorporating linear and S-shaped waveguides into the hyperuniform pattern. Both simulations and experiments confirm high transmission through the waveguides at frequencies within the bandgaps, demonstrating the flexibility of hyperuniform structures to support waveguides of complex shapes. These findings provide a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of traditional phononic crystals and advancing acoustic technologies in applications such as mechanical quantum computing and smartphone filters.

Title: Simultaneous MOKE imaging and measurement of magneto-resistance with vector magnet: a low noise customized setup for low field magnetic devices and thin films characterization
Authors: Imtiaz Noor Bhatti, Ilyas Noor Bhatti, L. G. Enger, P. Victor, B. Guillet, M. Lam Chok Sing, O. Rousseau, V. Pierron, S. Lebargy, J. Camarero, L. Mechin, S. Flament
Abstract: Here we report a custom design setup for the simultaneous measurement of magneto-resistance and MOKE imaging in longitudinal configuration for characterization of magnetic thin-films and sensors. The setup is designed so as to cope with a small signal to noise ratio of initial images and to allow sensitive magnetoresistance (MR) measurement at low field. An improved differential algorithm is used to get a good enough contrast of the magnetic images and get rid of beam illumination or small camera gain fluctuations. Home made power supply and pre-amplifier stage were designed so as to reduce the low frequency noise as well as the thermal electrical noise. A vector magnet is used to produce rotational magnetic field so as to study the magnetic anisotropy and calculate the anisotropic constants in magnetic thin films. Magnetoresistive sensors patterned on epitaxial La$_{0.67}$Sr$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LSMO) thin film have been characterized with this setup. The Images of the magnetization reversal process as well as the local magnetization loops deduced from these images provided evidence of a magnetic uniaxial anisotropy induced by the vicinal substrate. The magnetic anistropic constant of the films was then inferred from the MR measurements.

Title: Anomalous Reversal of Stability in Mo-containing Oxides: A Difficult Case Exhibiting Sensitivity to DFT+U and Distortion
Authors: Tzu-chen Liu, Dale Gaines II, Hyungjun Kim, Adolfo Salgado-Casanova, Steven B. Torrisi, Chris Wolverton
Abstract: Accurate predictions of the properties of transition metal oxides using density functional theory (DFT) calculations are essential for the computational design of energy materials. In this work, we investigate the anomalous reversal of the stability of structural distortions (where distorted structures go from being energetically favorable to sharply unfavorable relative to undistorted ones) induced by DFT+U on Mo d-orbitals in layered AMoO$_2$ (A = Li, Na, K) and rutile-like MoO$_2$. We highlight the significant impact of varying U$_{\text{eff}}$ values on the structural stability, convex hull, and thermodynamic stability predictions, noting that deviations can reach up to the order of 100 meV/atom across these energetic quantities. We find the transitions in stability are coincident with changes in the electron localization and magnetic behavior. The anomalous reversal persists across PBE, r$^2$SCAN functionals, and also with vdW-dispersion energy corrections (PBE+D3). In Mo-containing oxide systems, high U$_{\text{eff}}$ leads to inaccurate descriptions of physical quantities and structural relaxations under artificial symmetry constraints, as demonstrated by the phonon band structures, the Heyd-Scuseria-Ernzerhof (HSE06) hybrid functional results, and comparisons with experimental structural data. We conclude that high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values (around 4 eV and above, depending on the specific structures and compositions) might be unsuitable for energetic predictions in A-Mo-O chemical spaces. Our results suggest that the common practice of applying DFT+U to convex hull constructions, especially with high U$_{\text{eff}}$ values derived from fittings, should be carefully evaluated to ensure that ground states are correctly reproduced, with careful consideration of dynamic stability and possible energetically favorable distortions.

Title: Bit reset protocols that obey activity-constrained speed limits do not minimize work for a given speed
Authors: Daan Mulder, Thomas E. Ouldridge, Pieter Rein ten Wolde
Abstract: The goal of thermodynamic optimal control theory is to find protocols to change the state of a system from an initial to a desired final distribution, within a finite time, with the least possible expenditure of work. The optimal protocol is closely linked to the intrinsic dynamics of the system at hand. The fact that these dynamics can vary widely has made a general solution elusive. Recent years have seen great progress by recasting the question in terms of a quantity called total activity, i.e. the average number of jumps between states of the system, rather than the time that the operation is allowed to take. This perspective has allowed for general expressions for the minimal work as a function of the total activity, and the minimal total activity required for a given work. The expression for minimal total activity can be recast as an apparent minimal operation time or speed limit. However, it is unclear whether protocols optimized under a constrained activity actually require the lowest work input for a given operation time. In the context of bit reset, we show that directly minimizing work for a given operation time leads to protocols that require significantly less work to perform the operation than the activity-constrained protocol of the same duration. We show how the resulting protocols differ. One reason for the difference is the fact that the activity rate is not constant over the course of the protocol: it depends on both the transition rates and the distribution of the bit, both of which change during the copy operation. In the limit of long protocol duration, we find an expression for the difference between the resulting minimal work for both optimization schemes, for a general class of dynamics. The time-constrained approach always outperforms the activity-constrained approach for a given constrained duration, and the difference in work can be arbitrarily large.

Title: Partition function zeros for the Blume-Capel model on a complete graph
Authors: Yulian Honchar, Mariana Krasnytska, Bertrand Berche, Yurij Holovatch, Ralph Kenna
Abstract: In this paper we study finite-size effects in the Blume-Capel model through the analysis of the zeros of the partition function. We consider a complete graph and make use of the behaviour of the partition function zeros to elucidate the crossover from effective to asymptotic properties. While in the thermodynamic limit the exact solution yields the asymptotic mean-field behaviour, for finite system sizes an effective critical behaviour is observed. We show that even for large systems, the criticality is not asymptotic. We also present insights into how partition function zeros in different complex fields (temperature, magnetic field, crystal field) give different precision and provide us with different parts of the larger picture. This includes the differences between criticality and tricriticality as seen through the lens of Fisher, Lee-Yang, and Crystal Field zeros.

Title: A numerical toy model of Langevin dynamics provides real-time visualization of colloidal microdroplet evaporation
Authors: Gennadiy Derkachov, Tomasz Jakubczyk, Sima Alikhanzadeh-Arani, Tomasz Wojciechowski, Daniel Jakubczyk
Abstract: We have developed and tested a simplified but versatile numerical model of nanoparticles' aggregation using Langevin dynamics. The model is particularly capable of simulating aggregation in an evaporating (or condensing) microdroplet. It runs on a graphics processing unit (GPU), which makes it sufficiently fast for real-time conceptualization tasks. We have verified the results of modeling against the findings from two types of experiments we conducted in electrodynamic traps. Firstly, our model helped us to elucidate the phenomenon of scattering `revival', often observed during the evaporation of composite microdroplets. Further on, we were able to mimic our experiments, in which the microdroplets were dried up to form nanoparticle (NP) aggregates, and then soft-landed. Thus we could compare model predictions with SEM imaging. The model was tested for up to $2.5\times 10^5$ nanoparticles of several coexisting types. Several types of interactions can be accounted for: inter-particle: Lennard-Jones and Coulomb; external: dispersion medium viscosity, centrifugal force, gravity, surface tension, and interface movement. Brownian motion of nanoparticles can be freely controlled. The core program is accompanied by scripts extracting statistical NP aggregates properties in post-processing -- fractal dimension and radial distribution functions. The codes are made available in public repositories. Several diverse evolution scenarios are presented.

Title: Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible dynamics with mitigation in connection of infected population
Authors: K. M. Kim, C. Dias, M. O. Hase
Abstract: The susceptible-infected-susceptible epidemic model is analyzed through a degree-based mean-field approach. In this work, a mitigation factor is introduced in the probability of finding an infected individual following an edge. This modification simulates situations where the infected population reduces its participation in the dynamics of disease propagation, as may happen with the seclusion or hospitalization of infected individuals. A detailed investigation of this new model and its comparison to the original one (without the mitigation factor) was performed on the Barabási-Albert network, where some important results were analytically accessible.

Title: Probability distributions of the order parameter of the $O(N)$ model
Authors: Adam Rançon, Bertrand Delamotte, Lovro Šaravanja, Ivan Balog
Abstract: We study the probability distribution function (PDF) of the order parameter of the three-dimensional $O(N)$ model at criticality using the functional renormalisation group. For this purpose, we generalize the method introduced in [Balog et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. {\bf 129}, 210602 (2022)] to the $O(N)$ model. We study the large $N$ limit, as well as the cases $N=2$ and $N=3$ at the level of the Local Potential Approximation (LPA), and compare our results to Monte Carlo simulations. We compute the entire family of universal scaling functions, obtained in the limit where the system size $L$ and the correlation length of the infinite system $\xi_\infty$ diverge, with the ratio $\zeta=L/\xi_\infty$ constant. We also generalize our results to the approach of criticality from the low-temperature phase where another infinite family of universal PDF exists. We find that the LPA describes very well the functional form of the family of PDFs, once we correct for a global amplitude of the (logarithm of the) PDF and of $\zeta$.

Title: Interaction-enhanced many-body localization in a 1D quasiperiodic model with long-range hopping
Authors: Haowei Fan, Ke Huang, Xiao Li
Abstract: We study the many-body localization (MBL) transition in an 1D exactly solvable system with long-range hopping and quasiperiodic on-site potential introduced in Phys. Rev. Lett. 131, 186303 (2023). Unlike other disorder or quasiperiodic model, an interaction-enhanced MBL happens in the moderate interaction regime, which is dubbed as the interaction-enhanced MBL. This counterintuitive phenomenon can be understood by noticing the fragility of the critical band lying at the bottom of the spectrum. The fragile band is localized by other localized states once the interaction is turned on. This mechanism can be verified by introducing a mean-field theory description which can derive highly excited states with high accuracy. The effectiveness of this mean-field theory is captured by the quasihole physics, validated by the particle entanglement spectra.

Title: Taxonomy of amorphous ternary phase diagrams: the importance of interaction parameters
Authors: Yasin Ameslon, Hao Liu, Jens Harting, Olivier J.J. Ronsin, Olga Wodo
Abstract: Phase diagrams offer a comprehensive representation of the thermodynamics of multi-component systems. However, for ternary amorphous systems, the different possible phase diagram types and their existence conditions are still unclear. Based on the systematic screening of the parameter space for three amorphous ternary material systems representative of polymer, small molecule, and solvent materials, we report identifying twenty-one phase diagram types generated using Flory-Huggins theory. The proposed classification relies on the number of immiscible material pairs, distinct miscibility gaps, and three-phase regions. We infer existence rules by mapping the type of phase diagram to the range of interaction parameters in the three-dimensional parameter space. Depending on the number of immiscible pairs (0, 1, 2, or 3), four well-known phase-diagram types are found to be very likely. However, numerous uncommon phase diagrams are observed within a small parameter window around the critical interaction parameter values. Regarding the processability window, the size of the miscible region becomes sensitive to interaction parameter variations, mainly when they are close to critical values. The sensitivity decreases for materials with increasing molar size. Finally, the paper includes a successful comparison of simulated phase diagrams with experimental data, showcasing the real-world relevance of this theoretical analysis and its applicability for optimizing solution processing methods efficiently.

Title: Anomalous topological edge modes in a periodically-driven trimer lattice
Authors: Mohammad Ghuneim, Raditya Weda Bomantara
Abstract: Periodically driven systems have a longstanding reputation for establishing rich topological phenomena beyond their static counterpart. In this work, we propose and investigate a periodically driven extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with three sites per unit cell, obtained by replacing the Pauli matrices with their $3\times 3$ counterparts. The system is found to support a number of edge modes over a range of parameter windows, some of which have no static counterparts. Among these edge modes, of particular interest are those which are pinned at a specific quasienergy value. Such quasienergy-fixed edge modes arise due to the interplay between topology and chiral symmetry, which are typically not expected in a three-band static model due to the presence of a bulk band at the only chiral-symmetric energy value, i.e., zero. In our time-periodic setting, another chiral-symmetric quasienergy value exists at half the driving frequency, which is not occupied by a bulk band and could then host chiral-symmetry-protected edge modes ($\pi$ modes). Finally, we verify the robustness of all edge modes against spatial disorder and briefly discuss the prospect of realizing our system in experiments.

Title: Reflections of topological properties in the planar-Hall response for semimetals carrying pseudospin-1 quantum numbers
Authors: Firdous Haidar, Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We continue our investigations of the nature of the linear-response tensors in planar-Hall and planar-thermal Hall configurations, involving three-dimensional nodal-point semimetals, by considering here nodes hosting pseudospin-1 quasiparticles. Such systems exemplify multifold semimetals, as they have three bands crossing at a nodal point. We derive the explicit expressions of the electric, thermoelectric, and thermal coefficients, when the nodes are subjected to the combined influence of an electric field (and/or temperature gradient) and a weak (i.e., nonquantizing) magnetic field. In order to have a complete description, we consider the effects of the Berry curvature and the orbital magnetic moment on an equal footing, both of which originate from the underlying topological features of the bandstructure. Going beyond our previous works, we determine the out-of-plane response comprising the intrinsic anomalous-Hall and the Lorentz-force-contributed currents, and chalk out the effects of internode-scatterings as well. Our theoretical explorations shed light on the mechanisms of transport in multifold semetals, which are being investigated in contemporary experiments.

Title: Signatures of higher order skyrmionic textures revealed by magnetic force microscopy
Authors: Sabri Koraltan, Joe Sunny, Tamer Karaman, Reshma Peremadathil-Pradeep, Emily Darwin, Felix Büttner, Dieter Suess, Hans Josef Hug, Manfred Albrecht
Abstract: Higher-order skyrmions and antiskyrmions are topologically protected spin textures with an integer topological charge other than $\pm 1$ and nucleate from topological point defects in regular Bloch walls, known as vertical Bloch lines. So far, they have only been observed using Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. In this work, we show that higher-order spin textures coexisting in Co/Ni multilayers at room temperature can be visualized by high-resolution magnetic force microscopy (MFM). The experimental results are supported by micromagnetic simulations confirming that different spin objects give rise to distinct MFM contrast in full agreement to our observations.

Title: Controlled probing of Anderson localization and non-Hermitian skin effect via topolectrical circuits
Authors: Dipendu Halder, Saurabh Basu
Abstract: The Anderson localization (AL) and the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE) are two distinct wavefunction-localization phenomena arising out of disorder and non-reciprocity, respectively. An integration of both in a single framework will provide a platform to study the interplay between the two. In this connection, we consider the one-dimensional Aubry-André (AA) model, which has garnered significant attention among the disordered models due to its self-dual properties. Hence, we investigate a non-reciprocal AA model with complex phase modulation and implement it in suitably designed topolectrical circuits featuring an interface, segregating two non-equivalent circuit networks. In the circuit, the voltage profile localizes at the interface due to the NHSE, while the AL limits localization phenomena within the vicinity of the excitation node. This competing phenomenon leads to a controllable, node-dependent localization or even partial delocalization of the output voltage. Our results not only provide a practical platform for experimentally studying and controlling the wave localization phenomenon but also highlight the potential of circuit architectures in designing highly sensitive sensors and information transfer in communication devices.

Title: Catalytic activity of Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy
Authors: Yogesh Kumar Yadav, Mohammad Abu Shaz, Thakur Prasad Yadav
Abstract: Magnesium hydride (MgH2) is a promising material for hydrogen storage because of its abundance and beneficial properties, such as high storage capacity and cost-effectiveness under mild conditions. Despite of these benefits, MgH2 unfavorable thermodynamics and kinetics make it difficult to use in real applications. In this work, the hydrogen storage properties of MgH2have been improved using Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr high entropy alloy (HEA) based catalysts, which has been synthesized via mechanical alloying. The experimental findings show that the beginning desorption temperature of MgH2significantly lowered from 425°C to 180°C by adding 5 wt. % Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA in MgH2. Moreover, the catalyst shows enhanced kinetics, attaining 7.3 wt. % hydrogen absorption in 3 minutes at 320°C with 15 atm hydrogen pressure, and ~5 wt. % desorption in 6 minutes at 320°C. These results highlight, how much lower its desorption temperature is than those of other well-known catalysts. Over a span of 25 cycles, MgH2 catalyzed by Al-Cu-Fe-Ni-Cr HEA exhibits remarkable cyclic stability with negligible fluctuations (~ 0.05 wt. %).After a thorough characterization of the materials, a workable catalytic mechanism for HEA was proposed in light of the results.

Title: Incommensurate quantum magnet based on 4f-electron in a zigzag spin-1/2 chain of YbCuS$_2$
Authors: T. Onimaru, Y. Ohmagari, S. Mizutani, R. Yamamoto, H. Kaneshima, C. Moriyoshi, D. T. Adroja, D. Khyalyavin, P. Manuel, H. Saito, C. Hotta
Abstract: We performed high-resolution powder neutron diffraction experiments and discovered an elliptic helical incommensurate magnetic structure in the semiconducting rare-earth magnet YbCuS2, featuring effective spin-1/2 Yb$^{3+}$ ions that form a zigzag chain. Upon cooling the sample to 0.2 K, we observed very weak magnetic peaks indexed with an incommensurate propagation vector k = [0, 0.305, 0] along the zigzag chain. The magnitude of the magnetic moment is at least one-third smaller than the expected value for the Yb$^{3+}$ Kramers doublet ground state. In an applied magnetic field, up-up-down magnetic order was observed at 7.5 T, characterized by diffraction peaks indexed with k = [0, 1/3, 0] and substantial uniform magnetic components. These observations agree well with theoretical calculations based on the density matrix renormalization group for a zigzag spin-1/2 model with isotropic Heisenberg interactions and off-diagonal symmetric $\Gamma$-type exchange interactions derived from material parameters. The theory elucidates the quantum mechanical nature of the incommensurate magnetism as remnant off-diagonal spin correlations in a nematic dimer-singlet state.

Title: Single-Atom Catalysis: An Opportunity For Surface Science
Authors: Gareth S. Parkinson
Abstract: Over the past decade, extensive research into single-atom catalysts (SACs) has revealed that the catalytic behavior of metal adatoms is highly dependent on how they interact with their support. A strong dependence on the local coordination environment has led to comparisons with metal-organic complexes, and there is growing excitement about the potential to fine-tune SACs by controlling the adsorption geometry. The rise of computational screening to identify the optimal support-metal combinations underscores the need for rigorous benchmarking of theoretical methods, to validate realistic geometries, mechanisms, and the impact of adsorption on stability and catalytic activity. The surface science approach is particularly well-suited for this task because it allows to precisely determine the geometry of the metal atom and interpret its catalytic behavior. Moreover, the effects of temperature and molecular adsorption on the model catalysts stability can be studied in isolation, and conclusions drawn from UHV studies tested in increasingly common near-ambient pressure and electrochemical setups. This perspective highlights recent breakthroughs and specific systems, including metal oxides, metal-organic frameworks, and carbon nitrides, where insights from surface science experiments can significantly advance understanding in this rapidly evolving field.

Title: Hallmarks of Spin Textures for High-Harmonic Generation
Authors: Francesco Gabriele, Carmine Ortix, Mario Cuoco, Filomena Forte
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling and quantum geometry are fundamental aspects in modern condensed matter physics, with their primary manifestations in momentum space being spin textures and Berry curvature. In this work, we investigate their interplay with high-harmonic generation (HHG) in two-dimensional non-centrosymmetric materials, with an emphasis on even-order harmonics. Our analysis reveals that the emergence of finite even-order harmonics necessarily requires a broken twofold rotational symmetry in the spin texture, as well as a non-trivial Berry curvature in systems with time-reversal invariance. This symmetry breaking can arise across various degrees of freedom and impact both spin textures and optical response via spin-orbit interactions. These findings underscore the potential of HHG as a powerful tool for exploring electronic phases with broken rotational symmetry, as well as the associated phase transitions in two-dimensional materials. This approach provides novel perspectives for designing symmetry-dependent nonlinear optical phenomena.

Title: Phenomenological modeling of the stress-free two-way shape-memory effect in semi-crystalline networks: Formulation, numerical simulation, and experimental validation
Authors: Matteo Arricca, Nicoletta Inverardi, Stefano Pandini, Maurizio Toselli, Massimo Messori, Ferdinando Auricchio, Giulia Scalet
Abstract: Polymers exhibiting the stress-free two-way shape-memory effect (SME) represent an appealing solution to achieve self-standing reversible actuation that is a fundamental feature required by numerous applications. The present paper proposes a one-dimensional continuum phenomenological framework to model single-component semi-crystalline polymer networks exhibiting both the one-way SME and the two-way SME under stress and stress-free conditions. A comprehensive experimental campaign is first performed on semi-crystalline networks based on poly($\varepsilon$-caprolactone) (PCL) to characterize the mechanical and thermal properties as well as the one-way and two-way shape memory behavior of the material under different thermo-mechanical conditions. The results guide the formulation of the model, elucidating the selection of the control and phase variables and motivating the choice of their evolution laws. Model capabilities are then demonstrated against experimental data. All the phenomena that influence the stress-free two-way SME, including the actuation temperature, heating/cooling rates, applied stress/strain, and the amount of skeleton and actuation phase, are analyzed and discussed, giving new important insight for application development.

Title: The importance of being discrete -- An agent-based model for active nematics and more
Authors: Mathieu Dedenon, Carles Blanch-Mercader, Karsten Kruse, Jens Elgeti
Abstract: Living systems are composed of discrete units, assembled through a hierarchy of structures, and active, by locally extracting energy from their environment to produce mechanical work. Hydrodynamic theories have been successfully applied to describe the large scale dynamics of active materials. Yet, the hydrodynamic limit requires a separation of scales which is not necessarily fulfilled among living systems. In this work, we propose a novel agent-based model of flexible rods exchanging active force dipoles with nematic symmetry, allowing us to explore their behavior down to the sub-agent scale. We obtain spontaneous flows and self-propulsion of $+1/2$ topological defects, hallmarks of the hydrodynamic theory of active nematics, even on scales smaller than the individual agent! Moreover, our results go beyond the hydrodynamic framework, identifying novel correlations between orientation and flows or strong asymmetries between contractile and extensile activity. Finally, we show the versatility of our agent-based model by presenting spontaneous flows in three dimensions and nematic tissue growth. Because living systems like cell tissues often exhibit several sources of activity, our framework opens the way for more integrated descriptions of living materials.

Title: Designing Guidance for Multiple Valley-based Topological States Driven by Magnetic Substrates: Potential Applications at High Temperatures
Authors: Xiyu Hong, Zhe Li
Abstract: Valley-based topological phases offer a wealth of exotic quantum states with tunable functionalities, driven by the valley degree of freedom. In this work, by constructing heterostructures of germanene (silicene, stanene) on various magnetic substrates, we address key tuning factors such as the spin-orbit coupling (SOC) strength of the substrate, magnetic orientations, and stacking orders, all of which govern multiple valley-based topological features. We present a comprehensive guiding principle for the efficient manipulation of these features, achieved simply by designing and modulating the magnetic properties of the underlying substrates. Specifically, increasing the SOC strength of the magnetic substrate acilitates a range of topological phase transitions characterized by different Chern numbers, with many systems exhibiting a transition from quantum valley Hall to quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) states. Additionally, rotating the in-plane magnetic orientation of the substrate enables tunability of the Chern number and chirality, within a moderate range of SOC strength. Furthermore, the antiferromagnetic coupling of the magnetic substrate can induce valley-based QAH states with substantial valley gaps, leveraging its high Curie temperature (TC) to enable the realization of multiple tunable magnetic topologies at elevated temperatures. Our findings provide a straightforward strategy for the design and manipulation of spintronic and valleytronic devices that can potentially operate under high-temperature conditions.

Title: Accelerated Discovery of Vanadium Oxide Compositions: A WGAN-VAE Framework for Materials Design
Authors: Danial Ebrahimzadeh, Sarah S. Sharif, Yaser M. Banad
Abstract: The discovery of novel materials with tailored electronic properties is crucial for advancing modern device technologies, yet traditional approaches rely on time-consuming empirical methods. We present an inverse design framework combining enhanced Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) with specialized Variational Autoencoder (VAE) to accelerate stable vanadium oxide (V-O) discovery for electronic applications. Our framework introduces a WGAN architecture with integrated stability constraints and formation energy predictions, plus a refined VAE utilizing voxel-based representation that captures atomic positions and lattice parameters while maintaining chemical validity. Applying this framework, we generated 451 unique V-O compositions, with 91 structures identified as stable and 44 as metastable under rigorous thermodynamic criteria, including novel V2O3 configurations below the Materials Project convex hull. Electronic structure analysis using spin-polarized DFT+U calculations revealed distinct electronic behaviors, including promising half-metallic characteristics for spintronics and quantum computing applications. Our approach achieves approximately 20% stability rate under strict criteria compared to previous benchmarks, demonstrating its effectiveness for accelerated materials discovery.

Title: Eliminating the confined dark-exciton qubit precession using an externally applied magnetic field
Authors: Zu-En Su, Dan Cogan, Ido Schwartz, Ayal Beck, David Gershoni
Abstract: We investigate experimentally and theoretically the behavior of the confined dark exciton in an InAs/GaAs semiconductor quantum dot, under the application of an external magnetic field in Voigt configuration. We show that by varying the magnitude and direction of the external field one can accurately control the dark-exciton fine-structure splitting. In addition, we show that the dark-exciton spin state is approximately polarized along the cubic crystallographic directions [100] or equivalents. By comparing our experimental results with a model for the exchange and Zeeman interactions, we find the conditions for nullifying the fine-structure splitting between the two eigenstates of the dark exciton, thereby stopping its qubit precession.

Title: Bundling architecture in elastic filaments with applied twist
Authors: Amit Dawadi, Animesh Biswas, Julien Chopin, Arshad Kudrolli
Abstract: We investigate the formation of helical multifilament bundles and the torque required to achieve them as a function of applied twist. Hyperelastic filaments with circular cross sections are mounted parallel in a uniform circle onto end-clamps that can move along the twist axis depending on the applied axial load. With increasing twist, the filaments describe a hyperbolic hyperboloid surface before coming into contact in a circle, and then packing in a tight helical bundle in the center with increasing twist. While the bundle appears ordered for sufficiently small number of filaments, they are disordered for large enough number of filaments and applied twist. We reveal with x-ray tomography, that the packing of the filaments becomes disordered following a radial-instability which leads to a decrease in bundle radius, and migration of filaments relative to each other in the bundle. Nonetheless, the helical angle of the filaments in the bundle are found to be essentially constant, resulting in inclination angles which increase with distance from axis of rotation. We develop energy minimization analysis to capture the observed variations in bundle length and torque as a function of number of filaments considering the neo-Hookean nature of the filaments. We show that the bundle geometry and the applied load can be used to describe the non-linear torque profile measured as a function of twist angle.

Abstract: Three-dimensional quantum spin liquids have remained elusive, hindered by reduced quantum fluctuations from larger lattice connectivity inherent to high-dimensional systems. Here, we investigate the remarkable persistence of dynamical short-range magnetic correlations in the nearly body-centered cubic garnet NaCa$_2$Cu$_2$(VO$_4$)$_3$ down to $T = 50$ mK, two orders of magnitude below its Curie-Weiss temperature. Using a combination of neutron and muon spectroscopies plus numerical simulations, we demonstrate that a spin-liquid phase emerges from the interplay of strongly frustrated exchange interactions and subtle temperature-dependent Jahn-Teller spin-lattice effects.

Title: Learning by Confusion: The Phase Diagram of the Holstein Model
Authors: George Issa, Owen Bradley, Ehsan Khatami, Richard Scalettar
Abstract: We employ the "learning by confusion" technique, an unsupervised machine learning approach for detecting phase transitions, to analyze quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the two-dimensional Holstein model--a fundamental model for electron-phonon interactions on a lattice. Utilizing a convolutional neural network, we conduct a series of binary classification tasks to identify Holstein critical points based on the neural network's learning accuracy. We further evaluate the effectiveness of various training datasets, including snapshots of phonon fields and other measurements resolved in imaginary time, for predicting distinct phase transitions and crossovers. Our results culminate in the construction of the finite-temperature phase diagram of the Holstein model.

Title: Global network control from local information
Authors: Aleksandar Haber, Ferenc Molnar, Adilson E. Motter
Abstract: In the classical control of network systems, the control actions on a node are determined as a function of the states of all nodes in the network. Motivated by applications where the global state cannot be reconstructed in real time due to limitations in the collection, communication, and processing of data, here we introduce a control approach in which the control actions can be computed as a function of the states of the nodes within a limited state information neighborhood. The trade-off between the control performance and the size of this neighborhood is primarily determined by the condition number of the controllability Gramian. Our theoretical results are supported by simulations on regular and random networks and are further illustrated by an application to the control of power-grid synchronization. We demonstrate that for well-conditioned Gramians, there is no significant loss of control performance as the size of the state information neighborhood is reduced, allowing efficient control of large networks using only local information.

Title: Dephasing-tolerant quantum sensing for transverse magnetic fields with spin qudits
Authors: Matteo Mezzadri, Luca Lepori, Alessandro Chiesa, Stefano Carretta
Abstract: We propose a dephasing-tolerant protocol for quantum sensing of transverse magnetic fields which exploits spin qudit sensors with embedded fault-tolerant (FT) quantum error correction. By exploiting longitudinal drives, the transverse field induces logical Rabi oscillations between encoded states, whose frequency is linear in the transverse field to be probed. Numerical simulations show that the present FT protocol enables the detection of very small fields, orders of magnitudes below the limit imposed by the coherence time.

Title: Deterministic printing and heterointegration of single colloidal quantum dot photon sources
Authors: Gregory G. Guymon, Hao A. Nguyen, David Sharp, Tommy Nguyen, Henry Lei, David S. Ginger, Kai-Mei C. Fu, Arka Majumdar, Brandi M. Cossairt, J. Devin MacKenzie
Abstract: Single nanoparticles are essential building blocks for next-generation quantum photonic technologies, however, scalable and deterministic heterointegration strategies have remained largely out of reach. Here, we present a new electrohydrodynamic (EHD) printing model that exploits nanoscale dielectrophoretics to precisely print single colloidal quantum dots (QDs) with accuracies allowing for fully-additive nanoscale photonics integration. Using colossal-shelled QDs solubilized in apolar solvents, this method overcomes continuum fluid surface energetics and stochastic limitations, achieving selective extraction and deposition of individual QDs at sub-zeptoliter volumes. Photoluminescence and autocorrelation function (g(2)) measurements confirm nanophotonic cavity-QD integration and the first single-photon emission from printed QDs. This additive, zero-waste nanomanufacturing process offers a scalable, sustainable pathway for heterointegrating nanomaterials down to the single particle level.

Title: Optimal qubit-mediated quantum heat transfer via non-commuting operators and strong coupling effects
Authors: Marlon Brenes, Jakub Garwoła, Dvira Segal
Abstract: Heat transfer in quantum systems is a current topic of interest due to emerging quantum technologies that attempt to miniaturize engines and examine fundamental aspects of thermodynamics. In this work, we consider heat transfer between two thermal reservoirs in which a central spin degree of freedom mediates the process. Our objective is to identify the system-bath coupling operators that maximize heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling strengths. By employing a Markovian embedding method in the form of the reaction-coordinate mapping, we study numerically heat transfer at arbitrary system-bath coupling energy and for general system-bath coupling operators between the baths and the central qubit system. We find a stark contrast in the conditions required for optimal heat transfer depending on whether the system is weakly or strongly coupled to the heat baths. In the weak-coupling regime, optimal heat transfer requires identical coupling operators that facilitate maximum sequential transport, resonant with the central qubit. In contrast, in the strong-coupling regime, non-commuting system-bath coupling operators between the hot and cold reservoirs are necessary to achieve optimal heat transfer. We further employ the Effective Hamiltonian theory and gain partial analytical insights on the observed phenomena. We discuss the limitations of this approximate method in capturing the behavior of the heat current for non-commuting coupling operators, calling for its future extensions to capture transport properties in systems with general interaction Hamiltonians.

Title: Exploring the Expertise of Large Language Models in Materials Science and Metallurgical Engineering
Authors: Christophe Bajan, Guillaume Lambard
Abstract: The integration of artificial intelligence into various domains is rapidly increasing, with Large Language Models (LLMs) becoming more prevalent in numerous applications. This work is included in an overall project which aims to train an LLM specifically in the field of materials science. To assess the impact of this specialized training, it is essential to establish the baseline performance of existing LLMs in materials science. In this study, we evaluated 15 different LLMs using the MaScQA question answering (Q&A) benchmark. This benchmark comprises questions from the Graduate Aptitude Test in Engineering (GATE), tailored to test models' capabilities in answering questions related to materials science and metallurgical engineering. Our results indicate that closed-source LLMs, such as Claude-3.5-Sonnet and GPT-4, perform the best with an overall accuracy of ~84%, while the open-source models, Llama3-70b and Phi3-14b, top at ~56% and ~43%, respectively. These findings provide a baseline for the raw capabilities of LLMs on Q&A tasks applied to materials science, and emphasize the substantial improvement that could be brought to open-source models via prompt engineering and fine-tuning strategies. We anticipate that this work could push the adoption of LLMs as valuable assistants in materials science, demonstrating their utility in this specialized domain and related sub-domains.

Authors: Bingjie Guo, Xinhui Chen, An Chen, Jinxin Wang, Wuhong Xue, Tao Wang, Zhixin Wu, Xiaolong Zhong, Jianmin Zeng, Jinjin Li, Mao Li, Xiaohong Xu, Yu Chen, Gang Liu
Abstract: Organic memories, with small dimension, fast speed and long retention features, are considered as promising candidates for massive data archiving. In order to satisfy the re-quirements for ultra-low power and high-security information storage, we design a concep-tual molecular hard-disk (HDD) logic scheme that is capable to execute in-situ encryption of massive data in pW/bit power-consumption range. Beneficial from the coupled mechanism of counter-balanced redox reaction and local ion drifting, the basic HDD unit consisting of ~ 200 self-assembled RuXLPH molecules in a monolayer (SAM) configuration undergoes unique conductance modulation with continuous, symmetric and low-power switching char-acteristics. 96-state memory performance, which allows 6-bit data storage and single-unit one-step XOR operation, is realized in the RuXLPH SAM sample. Through single-unit XOR manipulation of the pixel information, in-situ bitwise encryption of the Mogao Grottoes mural images stored in the molecular HDD is demonstrated.

Title: Probabilistic Greedy Algorithm Solver Using Magnetic Tunneling Junctions for Traveling Salesman Problem

Abstract: Combinatorial optimization problems are foundational challenges in fields such as artificial intelligence, logistics, and network design. Traditional algorithms, including greedy methods and dynamic programming, often struggle to balance computational efficiency and solution quality, particularly as problem complexity scales. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel and efficient probabilistic optimization framework that integrates true random number generators (TRNGs) based on spin-transfer torque magnetic tunneling junctions (STT-MTJs). The inherent stochastic switching behavior of STT-MTJs enables dynamic configurability of random number distributions, which we leverage to introduce controlled randomness into a probabilistic greedy algorithm. By tuning a temperature parameter, our algorithm seamlessly transitions between deterministic and stochastic strategies, effectively balancing exploration and exploitation. Furthermore, we apply this framework to the traveling salesman problem (TSP), showcasing its ability to consistently produce high-quality solutions across diverse problem scales. Our algorithm demonstrates superior performance in both solution quality and convergence speed compared to classical approaches, such as simulated annealing and genetic algorithms. Specifically, in larger TSP instances involving up to 70 cities, it retains its performance advantage, achieving near-optimal solutions with fewer iterations and reduced computational costs. This work highlights the potential of integrating MTJ-based TRNGs into optimization algorithms, paving the way for future applications in probabilistic computing and hardware-accelerated optimization.

Title: Non-Markovianity increases transition path probability
Authors: Florian N. Brünig, Benjamin A. Dalton, Jan O. Daldrop, Roland R. Netz
Abstract: Defining low-dimensional reaction coordinates is crucial for analyzing the dynamics of complex systems and for comparison with experiments. The maximal value of the transition-path probability along the reaction coordinate $x$, $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$, is a common estimator for reaction-coordinate quality by comparing to the theoretical maximal value of 1/2 in the overdamped Markovian limit. We show by analytical arguments and simulations that for non-Markovian dynamics $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ is non-monotonic as a function of the memory time and exceeds 1/2 for long memory time. This disqualifies $p(\mathrm{TP}|x)$ as a criterion for reaction coordinate quality.

Title: Quantum-inspired Embeddings Projection and Similarity Metrics for Representation Learning
Authors: Ivan Kankeu, Stefan Gerd Fritsch, Gunnar Schönhoff, Elie Mounzer, Paul Lukowicz, Maximilian Kiefer-Emmanouilidis
Abstract: Over the last decade, representation learning, which embeds complex information extracted from large amounts of data into dense vector spaces, has emerged as a key technique in machine learning. Among other applications, it has been a key building block for large language models and advanced computer vision systems based on contrastive learning. A core component of representation learning systems is the projection head, which maps the original embeddings into different, often compressed spaces, while preserving the similarity relationship between vectors. In this paper, we propose a quantum-inspired projection head that includes a corresponding quantum-inspired similarity metric. Specifically, we map classical embeddings onto quantum states in Hilbert space and introduce a quantum circuit-based projection head to reduce embedding dimensionality. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we extended the BERT language model by integrating our projection head for embedding compression. We compared the performance of embeddings, which were compressed using our quantum-inspired projection head, with those compressed using a classical projection head on information retrieval tasks using the TREC 2019 and TREC 2020 Deep Learning benchmarks. The results demonstrate that our quantum-inspired method achieves competitive performance relative to the classical method while utilizing 32 times fewer parameters. Furthermore, when trained from scratch, it notably excels, particularly on smaller datasets. This work not only highlights the effectiveness of the quantum-inspired approach but also emphasizes the utility of efficient, ad hoc low-entanglement circuit simulations within neural networks as a powerful quantum-inspired technique.

Title: Motion and hydrodynamic resistance of an elastic bead confined in a square microchannel
Authors: Charles Paul Moore, Hiba Belkadi, Brouna Safi, Gabriel Amselem, Charles N. Baroud
Abstract: Cells and other soft particles are often forced to flow in confined geometries in both laboratory and natural environments, where the elastic deformation induces an additional drag and pressure drop across the particle. In contrast with other multiphase flows, the physical parameters that determine this additional pressure are still not known. Here we start by measuring the pressure drop across a single spherical hydrogel particle as it flows in a microfluidic comparator. This pressure is found to depend on the amount of confinement, elastic modulus, fluid viscosity and velocity. A model for the force balance on the particle is then proposed, by incorporating the above ingredients and relying on simulations of bead geometry and lubrication flow considerations. The final model collapses the force measurements forces onto a single scaling law spanning several decades, while providing physical insights by recalling elements from classic multiphase flows and contact mechanics.

Title: Chondrule dust rim growth: Influence of restructuring using molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Chuchu Xiang, Nina Merkert, Lorin S. Matthews, Augusto Carballido, Truell W. Hyde
Abstract: We investigate the influence of disruptive collisions on chondrule rim growth, emphasizing the role of kinetic energy in determining the outcomes of these interactions. We establish a threshold of approximately 10 cm/s for the "hit-and-stick" collision regime, beyond which significant changes occur in the structure of rimmed chondrules. Our findings highlight that at low collision energies (KE $< 10^{-12}$ J), minimal structural alteration takes place, while higher energies (KE up to $10^{-10}$ J) lead to compaction of the rim, reducing both its thickness and porosity. Collisions with energies exceeding $10^{-8}$ J result in the complete disruption of the rim, with particles being expelled from it. These results are correlated with the turbulence levels within the disk, as kinetic energy scales with the relative velocities of colliding particles. Leveraging machine learning models trained on our collision data, we predict changes in rim characteristics and employ these predictions in a Monte Carlo simulation to explore rim growth dynamics. Our simulations reveal that rim development is sustained in low-turbulence environments ($\alpha \leq 10^{-5}$), while intermediate turbulence levels ($\alpha$ = $10^{-3}$ to $10^{-4}$) lead to erosion, preventing further rim accumulation in high-turbulence contexts.

Title: Meson-polariton and string dynamics via cavity coupling in Rydberg atom array
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan B. Xavier, Matteo Marinelli, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: We investigate the real time meson and string dynamics of one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays in presence of a collective cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. Single domain walls on top of ordered states behave differently from those found in Ising models, featuring strong anisotropy because of the $U(1)$ invariant coupling between light and matter. The non-local nature of the cavity mode is instead affecting meson and string dynamics drastically. Meson hybridizes coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polariton excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy and propagate freely thanks to the non-local interaction between the underlying domain-walls mediated by the cavity mode. We conclude by examining the effect of cavity losses, proposing a state-preparation protocol which actively uses the cavity mode, and presenting a concrete experimental blueprint.

Title: Extracting the spin excitation spectrum of a fermionic system using a quantum processor
Authors: Lucia Vilchez-Estevez, Raul A. Santos, Sabrina Wang, Filippo Maria Gambetta
Abstract: Understanding low-energy excitations in fermionic systems is crucial for their characterization. They determine the response of the system to external weak perturbations, its dynamical correlation functions, and provide mechanisms for the emergence of exotic phases of matter. In this work, we study the spin excitation spectra of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model using a digital quantum processor. Introducing a protocol that is naturally suited for simulation on quantum computers, we recover the retarded spin Green's function from the time evolution of simple observables after a specific quantum quench. We exploit the robustness of the protocol to perturbations of the initial state to minimize the quantum resources required for the initial state preparation, and to allocate the majority of them to a Trotterized time-dynamics simulation. This, combined with the intrinsic resilience to noise of the protocol, allows us to accurately reconstruct the spin excitation spectrum for large instances of the 1D Fermi-Hubbard model without making use of expensive error mitigation techniques, using up to 30 qubits of an IBM Heron r2 device.

Title: Broadband electron paramagnetic resonance spectroscopy of $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ at mK temperatures
Authors: Ana Strinic, Patricia Oehrl, Achim Marx, Pavel A. Bushev, Hans Huebl, Rudolf Gross, Nadezhda Kukharchyk
Abstract: Rare-earth spin ensembles are a promising platform for microwave quantum memory applications due to their hyperfine transitions, which can exhibit exceptionally long coherence times when using an operation point with zero first-order Zeeman (ZEFOZ) shift. In this work, we use broadband electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy on $^{167}$Er:$^{7}$LiYF$_4$ single crystals at sub-Kelvin temperatures. By fitting the spin Hamiltonian to the zero-field spectrum, we obtain refined parameters of the magnetic field-independent interactions, such as the hyperfine and quadrupole interaction. We also study the influence of the quadrupole interaction on the hyperfine splitting in the zero and low magnetic field range by analyzing EPR-spectra between \SI{0}{\milli\tesla} and \SI{50}{\milli\tesla}. %We further analyze the linewidth narrowing of a hyperfine transition around its ZEFOZ point. Our findings highlight the broadband EPR spectroscopy approach as a powerful tool for the precise determination of the spin Hamiltonian parameters and for the characterization of hyperfine transitions in terms of their selection rules and linewidth.

Title: Hot wormholes and chaos dynamics in a two-coupled SYK model
Authors: Martí Berenguer, Javier Mas, Juan Santos-Suárez, Alfonso V. Ramallo
Abstract: We study the dynamics of chaos across the phase transition in a 2-coupled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, with a focus on the unstable "hot wormhole" phase. Using the Schwinger-Keldysh formalism, we employ two non-equilibrium protocols that allow access to this phase, which is inaccessible through equilibrium simulations: one involves cooling the system via a coupling to a thermal bath, while in the other we periodically drive the coupling parameter between the two sides. We numerically compute the Lyapunov exponents of the hot wormhole for the two cases. Our results uncover a rich structure within this phase, including both thermal and non-thermal solutions. These behaviors are analyzed in detail, with partial insights provided by the Schwarzian approximation, which captures certain but not all aspects of the observed dynamics.

Title: Exploring nontrivial topology at quantum criticality in a superconducting processor

Wang, Hai-Qing Lin, Fei Wu
Abstract: The discovery of nontrivial topology in quantum critical states has introduced a new paradigm for classifying quantum phase transitions and challenges the conventional belief that topological phases are typically associated with a bulk energy gap. However, realizing and characterizing such topologically nontrivial quantum critical states with large particle numbers remains an outstanding experimental challenge in statistical and condensed matter physics. Programmable quantum processors can directly prepare and manipulate exotic quantum many-body states, offering a powerful path for exploring the physics behind these states. Here, we present an experimental exploration of the critical cluster Ising model by preparing its low-lying critical states on a superconducting processor with up to $100$ qubits. We develop an efficient method to probe the boundary $g$-function based on prepared low-energy states, which allows us to uniquely identify the nontrivial topology of the critical systems under study. Furthermore, by adapting the entanglement Hamiltonian tomography technique, we recognize two-fold topological degeneracy in the entanglement spectrum under periodic boundary condition, experimentally verifying the universal bulk-boundary correspondence in topological critical systems. Our results demonstrate the low-lying critical states as useful quantum resources for investigating the interplay between topology and quantum criticality.

Yao, H. Wang, Dong-Ling Deng
Abstract: Symmetry-protected topological phases cannot be described by any local order parameter and are beyond the conventional symmetry-breaking paradigm for understanding quantum matter. They are characterized by topological boundary states robust against perturbations that respect the protecting symmetry. In a clean system without disorder, these edge modes typically only occur for the ground states of systems with a bulk energy gap and would not survive at finite temperatures due to mobile thermal excitations. Here, we report the observation of a distinct type of topological edge modes, which are protected by emergent symmetries and persist even up to infinite temperature, with an array of 100 programmable superconducting qubits. In particular, through digital quantum simulation of the dynamics of a one-dimensional disorder-free "cluster" Hamiltonian, we observe robust long-lived topological edge modes over up to 30 cycles at a wide range of temperatures. By monitoring the propagation of thermal excitations, we show that despite the free mobility of these excitations, their interactions with the edge modes are substantially suppressed in the dimerized regime due to an emergent U(1)$\times$U(1) symmetry, resulting in an unusually prolonged lifetime of the topological edge modes even at infinite temperature. In addition, we exploit these topological edge modes as logical qubits and prepare a logical Bell state, which exhibits persistent coherence in the dimerized and off-resonant regime, despite the system being disorder-free and far from its ground state. Our results establish a viable digital simulation approach to experimentally exploring a variety of finite-temperature topological phases and demonstrate a potential route to construct long-lived robust boundary qubits that survive to infinite temperature in disorder-free systems.

Title: Non-Markovian dynamics of BIC generation via single-photon scattering
Authors: Giuseppe Magnifico, Maria Maffei, Domenico Pomarico, Debmalya Das, Paolo Facchi, Saverio Pascazio, Francesco V. Pepe
Abstract: The excitation of bound states in the continuum (BICs) in two- or multi-qubit systems lies at the heart of entanglement generation and harnessing in waveguide quantum electrodynamics platforms. However, the generation of qubit pair BICs through single-photon scattering is hindered by the fact that these states are effectively decoupled from propagating photons. We prove that scattering of a parity-invariant single photon on a qubit pair, combined with a properly engineered time variation of the qubit detuning, is not only feasible, but also more effective than strategies based on the relaxation of the excited states of the qubits. The use of tensor network methods to simulate the proposed scheme enables to include photon delays in collision models, thus opening the possibility to follow the time evolution of the full quantum system, including qubits and field, and to efficiently implement and characterize the dynamics in non-ideal cases, which turn out to be optimal for the BIC generation strategy.

Title: Reducing disorder in PbTe nanowires for Majorana research

Abstract: Material challenges are the key issue in Majorana research where surface disorder constrains device performance. Here, we tackle this challenge by embedding PbTe nanowires within a lattice-constant-matched crystal. The wire edges are shaped by self-organized growth instead of lithography, resulting in nearly-atomic-flat facets along both cross-sectional and longitudinal directions. Quantized conductance is observed at zero magnetic field with channel lengths maximally reaching 1.7 $\mu$m, significantly surpassing the state-of-the-art of III-V nanowires (an order-of-magnitude improvement compared to InSb). Coupling PbTe to a Pb film unveils a flat interface spanning microns and a large superconducting gap of 1 meV. Our result not only represents a stride toward meeting the stringent low-disorder requirement for Majoranas, but may also open the door to various hybrid quantum devices requiring a low level of disorder.

Title: Obstacles to two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier
Authors: Victor K. Kornev, Alena N. Nikolaeva, Nikolay V. Kolotinskiy
Abstract: Obstacles to the two-line Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifier (JTWPA) designs, aimed at increasing the allowed pump wave energy and, hence, the gain growth through the combination of linear and nonlinear lines as pump and signal lines is discussed. This analysis takes into account both the mutual coupling and the discreteness of the artificial waveguide lines. Significant restrictions arise from the cyclical transfer of the traveling wave's energy from one line to the other one with phase step by $\pi$ every beat cycle. Moreover, the other restrictions result from the phase mismatch between the pump, signal and idler waves due to both the coupling and the discreteness of the artificial lines.

Title: Extended Metal-Insulator Crossover with Strong Antiferromagnetic Spin Correlation in Half-Filled 3D Hubbard Model
Authors: Yu-Feng Song, Youjin Deng, Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: The Hubbard model at temperatures above the Néel transition, despite being a paramagnet, can exhibit rich physics due to the interplay of Fermi surface, on-site interaction $U$ and thermal fluctuations. Nevertheless, the understanding of the crossover physics remains only at a qualitative level, because of the intrinsically smooth behavior. Employing an improved variant of the {\it numerically exact} auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo algorithm equipped with numerical analytic continuation, we obtain a broad variety of thermodynamic and dynamical properties of the three-dimensional Hubbard model at half filling, quantitatively determine the crossover boundaries, and observe that the metal-insulator crossover regime, in which antiferromagnetic spin correlations appear strongest, exists over an extended regime in between the Fermi liquid for small $U$ and the Mott insulator for large $U$. In particular, the location of the most rapid suppression of double occupancy as $U$ increases, is found to fully reside in the metallic Fermi liquid regime, in contrast to the conventional intuition that it is a representative feature for entering the Mott insulator. Beside providing a reliable methodology for numerical study of crossover physics, our work can also serve as a timely and important guideline for the most recent optical lattice experiments.

Title: Origins of suppressed self-diffusion of nanoscale constituents of a complex liquid

Limmer, Dmitri V. Talapin, Samuel W. Teitelbaum, Naomi S. Ginsberg
Abstract: The ability to understand and ultimately control the transformations and properties of various nanoscale systems, from proteins to synthetic nanomaterial assemblies, hinges on the ability to uncover their dynamics on their characteristic length and time scales. Here, we use MHz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (XPCS) to directly elucidate the characteristic microsecond-dynamics of density fluctuations of semiconductor nanocrystals (NCs), not only in a colloidal dispersion but also in a liquid phase consisting of densely packed, yet mobile, NCs with no long-range order. We find the wavevector-dependent fluctuation rates in the liquid phase are suppressed relative to those in the colloidal phase and relative to observations of densely packed repulsive particles. We show that the suppressed rates are due to a substantial decrease in the self-diffusion of NCs in the liquid phase, which we attribute to explicit attractive interactions. Using coarse-grained simulations, we find that the extracted shape and strength of the interparticle potential explains the stability of the liquid phase, in contrast to the gelation observed via XPCS in many other charged colloidal systems. This work opens the door to elucidating fast, condensed phase dynamics in complex fluids and other nanoscale soft matter, such as densely packed proteins and non-equilibrium self-assembly processes, in addition to designing microscopic strategies to avert gelation.

Title: Scheme for braiding Majorana zero modes in vortices using an STT-matrix
Authors: Guangyao Huang, Xinfang Zhang, Xiaofeng Yi, Jibang Fu, Weichen Wang, Mingtang Deng
Abstract: Recently conducted experiments on two-dimensional topological superconductors have revealed various indications of Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, progress in the manipulation of MZM braiding has been limited, impeding the realization of topological quantum computing. In this study, we propose a potential braiding scheme based on a spintronic device matrix. This scheme involves utilizing a matrix composed of spin-transfer torque devices (STT-matrix) alongside a two-dimensional topological superconductor material. By programming the ON/OFF states of the spintronic devices within the STT-matrix, it becomes possible to manipulate vortices hosting MZMs in the two-dimensional topological superconductor. To further investigate this concept, we construct a time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau model and perform numerical simulations to analyze vortex-driving dynamics, MZM braiding processes, and MZM fusion phenomena. Our findings demonstrate that this system exhibits high versatility and flexibility in manipulating vortices. With advancements in spintronic device technology, our proposed scheme offers a feasible and practical method for operating MZMs within vortices present in topological superconductors.

Title: Cavity-enhanced superconductivity via band engineering
Authors: Valerii K. Kozin, Even Thingstad, Daniel Loss, Jelena Klinovaja
Abstract: We consider a two-dimensional electron gas interacting with a quantized cavity mode. We find that the coupling between the electrons and the photons in the cavity enhances the superconducting gap. Crucially, all terms in the Peierls phase are kept, in contrast to more naive approaches, which may result in spurious superradiant phase transitions. We use a mean-field theory to show that the gap increases approximately linearly with the cavity coupling strength. The effect can be observed locally as an increase in the gap size via scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements for a flake of a 2D material (or for a Moiré system where the enhancement is expected to be more pronounced due to a large lattice constant) interacting with a locally-structured electromagnetic field formed by split-ring resonators. Our results are also relevant for quantum optics setups with cold atoms interacting with the cavity mode, where the lattice geometry and system parameters can be tuned in a vast range.

Title: Dynamic generation of superflow in a fermionic ring through phase imprinting
Authors: Ke-Ji Chen, Wei Yi, Fan Wu
Abstract: We study the dynamic generation of persistent current by phase imprinting fermionic atoms in a ring geometry. Mediated by the pairing interaction, the Fermi condensate dynamically acquires a quantized current by developing azimuthal phase slips, as well as density and pairing-order-parameter depletions. Resorting to the Bogolioubov-de Gennes formalism, we investigate the time evolution of the transferred total angular momentum and the quantized superfluid current throughout the phase-imprinting process. This enables a detailed analysis of the impact of interaction, as well as different initial pairing states, on the superflow formation. In particular, we show that, as the condensate is tuned toward the Bose-Einstein-condensate side of the Feshbach resonance, the azimuthal density distribution becomes less susceptible to the phase imprinting potential, leading to smaller quantized current under the same imprinting parameters. Our results offer microscopic insights into the dynamic development of superflow in the phase-imprinting process, and are helpful for the ongoing experimental effort.

Title: Exact quantization of topological order parameter in SU($N$) spin models, $N$-ality transformation and ingappabilities
Authors: Hang Su, Yuan Yao, Akira Furusaki
Abstract: We show that the ground-state expectation value of twisting operator is a topological order parameter for $\text{U}(1)$- and $\mathbb{Z}_{N}$-symmetric symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in one-dimensional "spin" systems -- it is quantized in the thermodynamic limit and can be used to identify different SPT phases and to diagnose phase transitions among them. We prove that this (non-local) order parameter must take values in $N$-th roots of unity, and its value can be changed by a generalized lattice translation acting as an $N$-ality transformation connecting distinct phases. This result also implies the Lieb-Schultz-Mattis ingappability for SU($N$) spins if we further impose a general translation symmetry. Furthermore, our exact result for the order parameter of SPT phases can predict a large number of LSM ingappabilities by the general lattice translation. We also apply the $N$-ality property to provide an efficient way to construct possible multi-critical phase transitions starting from a single Hamiltonian with a unique gapped ground state.

Title: Magnetization nutation in magnetic semiconductors: Effective spin model with anisotropic RKKY exchange interaction
Authors: H. Kachkachi
Abstract: We demonstrate that the magnetization in magnetic semiconductors exhibits nutational motion when subjected to an external magnetic field. This behavior originates from the splitting of the conduction-electron band which induces anisotropic, distance-dependent exchange coupling between localized spins. To investigate this phenomenon, we examine a general system that includes both charge and spin degrees of freedom, characteristic of a magnetic semiconductor. This system is composed of two subsystems: (1) a gas of noninteracting conduction electrons and (2) a ferromagnetic array of localized spins, coupled through the Vonsovskii (\textit{sd}) local interaction. The entire system is subject to external electrical and magnetic disturbances. Through the Feynman-Schwinger formalism, we integrate out the faster (Grassmann) charge degrees of freedom associated with the conduction electrons to obtain the effective Hamiltonian for the localized spins in the form of an XXZ spin model. We then provide general analytical formulas for the corresponding anisotropic exchange couplings, expressed in Fourier and direct spaces, as functions of the effective field that induces conduction-band splitting. .... We hope this study will motivate further research into nutational phenomena in magnetic semiconductors, possibly resulting in improvements in the accurate control of magnetization dynamics within spin-based electronic devices.

Title: Functional Decomposition and Estimation of Irreversibility in Time Series via Machine Learning
Authors: Michele Vodret, Cristiano Pacini, Christian Bongiorno
Abstract: This work introduces a novel, simple, and flexible method to quantify irreversibility in generic high-dimensional time series based on the well-known mapping to a binary classification problem. Our approach utilizes gradient boosting for estimation, providing a model-free, nonlinear analysis able to handle large-dimensional systems while requiring minimal or no calibration. Our procedure is divided into three phases: trajectory encoding, Markovian order identification, and hypothesis testing for variable interactions. The latter is the key innovation that allows us to selectively switch off variable interactions to discern their specific contribution to irreversibility. When applied to financial markets, our findings reveal a distinctive shift: during stable periods, irreversibility is mainly related to short-term patterns, whereas in unstable periods, these short-term patterns are disrupted, leaving only contributions from stable long-term ones. This observed transition underscores the crucial importance of high-order variable interactions in understanding the dynamics of financial markets, especially in times of turbulence.

Title: Spontaneous layer selective Mott phase in the bilayer Hubbard model
Authors: Emile Pangburn, Louis Haurie, Sébastien Burdin, Catherine Pépin, Anurag Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum materials featuring both itinerant and localized degrees of freedom exhibit numerous exotic phases and transitions that deviate from the Ginzburg-Landau paradigm. This work uses the composite operator formalism to examine the bilayer strongly correlated Hubbard model. We observe the spontaneous breaking of layer symmetry, where the electron density in one of the layer reaches half-filling, resulting in a layer selective Mott phase (LSMP). This broken symmetry phase becomes unstable at a critical average electronic density away from half-filling. Furthermore, significant layer differentiation persists up to a moderate inter-layer hopping, beyond which the system abruptly transitions to an layer uniform phase (LUP). In the LSMP phase, the electrons in the two layers are weakly hybridized, resulting in a small Fermi surface. The volume of the Fermi surface jumps at the transition from the LSMP to the uniform phase. We also discuss the physical mechanisms leading to the collapse of the LSMP phase under different perturbations.

Title: Influence of surface relaxations on scanning probe microscopy images of the charge density wave material 2H-NbSe$_2$
Authors: Nikhil S. Sivakumar, Joost Aretz, Sebastian Scherb, Marion van Midden Mavrič, Nora Huijgen, Umut Kamber, Daniel Wegner, Alexander A. Khajetoorians, Malte Rösner, Nadine Hauptmann
Abstract: Scanning tunneling microscopy is the method of choice for characterizing charge density waves by imaging the variation in atomic-scale contrast of the surface. Due to the measurement principle of scanning tunneling microscopy, the electronic and lattice degrees of freedom are convoluted, making it difficult to disentangle a structural displacement from spatial variations in the electronic structure. In this work, we characterize the influence of the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms on the 3 x 3 charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images of 2H-NbSe$_2$. In scanning tunneling microscopy images, we observe the 3 x 3 charge density wave superstructure and atomic lattice at all probed tip-sample distances. In contrast, non-contact atomic force microscopy images show both periodicities only at small tip-sample distances while, unexpectedly, a 3 x 3 superstructure is present at larger tip-sample distances. Using density functional theory calculations, we qualitatively reproduce the experimental findings and indicate that the 3 x 3 superstructure at different tip-sample distances in non-contact atomic force microscopy images is a result from different underlying interactions. In addition, we show that the displacement of the surface-terminating Se atoms has a negligible influence to the contrast in scanning tunneling microscopy images. Our combined experimental and theoretic work presents a method on how to discriminate the influence of the surface corrugation from the variation of the charge density to the charge density wave contrast in scanning probe microscopy images, which can provide insights into the influence of structural disorder to a charge density wave ground state.

Title: Phase diagram of compressible and paired states in the quarter-filled Landau level
Authors: Misha Yutushui, David F. Mross
Abstract: Quantum Hall plateaus at quarter fillings occur in GaAs wide quantum wells, hole-doped GaAs, and bilayer graphene. However, the interactions favoring incompressible states over compressible composite-Fermi liquids at such fillings are not well understood. We devise a method of computing the trial energies for Haldane pseudopotentials via Monte Carlo sampling. Applying it to the quarter-filled lowest Landau level, we find that tuning the third and fifth pseudopotential can stabilize anti-Pfaffian, Moore-Read, and f-wave states. The smallest deviations from pure Coulomb interactions are required by anti-Pfaffian, whose presence is indicated by daughter states in recent experiments of bilayer graphene at $\nu=\frac{3}{4}$.

Title: Imaging ferroelectric domains with soft X-ray ptychography at the oxygen K-edge
Authors: Tim A. Butcher, Nicholas W. Phillips, Chia-Chun Wei, Shih-Chao Chang, Igor Beinik, Karina Thånell, Jan-Chi Yang, Shih-Wen Huang, Jörg Raabe, Simone Finizio
Abstract: The ferroelectric domain structure of a freestanding BiFeO$_3$ film was visualized by ptychographic dichroic imaging with linearly polarized X-rays at the O K-edge around 530 eV. The dichroic contrast is maximized at the energy of the hybridization of the O 2p state and the Fe 3d orbitals, which is split by the octahedral crystal field of the perovskite structure. The microscopy images thus obtained complement the ptychographic imaging of the antiferromagnetic contribution at the Fe L$_3$-edge. The approach can be extended to the separation of different ferroic contributions in other multiferroic oxides.

Title: Thermodynamic properties of the macroscopically degenerate tetramer-dimer phase of the spin-1/2 Heisenberg model on the diamond-decorated square lattice
Authors: Katarina Karlova, Andreas Honecker, Nils Caci, Stefan Wessel, Jozef Strecka, Taras Verkholyak
Abstract: The spin-1/2 Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the diamond-decorated square lattice in the presence of a magnetic field displays various quantum phases including the Lieb-Mattis ferrimagnetic, dimer-tetramer, monomer-dimer, and spin-canted phases, in addition to the trivial fully saturated state. Thermodynamic properties of this model are investigated using several complementary analytical and numerical methods such as exact diagonalization up to the systems of 40 spins, an effective monomer-dimer description, sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo simulations for up to 180 spins, and a decoupling approximation. Our particular attention is focused on the parameter region favoring the dimer-tetramer phase. This ground state can be represented by a classical hard-dimer model on the square lattice and retains a macroscopic degeneracy even under a magnetic field. However, the description of the low-temperature thermodynamics close to the boundary between the macroscopically degenerate dimer-tetramer and the non-degenerate monomer-dimer phases requires an extended classical monomer-dimer lattice-gas model. Anomalous thermodynamic properties emerging in the vicinity of the dimer-tetramer phase are studied in detail. Under the adiabatic demagnetization we detect an enhanced magnetocaloric effect promoting an efficient cooling to absolute zero temperature, provided that the system reaches the dimer-tetramer ground state at zero field.

Title: Frustrated S = 1/2 Chains in One-Dimensional Correlated Metal Ti4MnBi2
Authors: X. Y. Li, A. Nocera, K. Foyevtsova, G. A. Sawatzky, M. Oudah, N. Murai, M. Kofu, M. Matsuura, H. Tamatsukuri, M. C. Aronson
Abstract: Electronic correlations lead to heavy quasiparticles in three-dimensional (3D) metals, and their collapse can destabilize magnetic moments. It is an open question whether there is an analogous instability in one-dimensional (1D) systems, unanswered due to the lack of metallic spin chain materials. We report neutron scattering measurements and Density Matrix Renormalization Group calculations establishing spinons in the correlated metal Ti4MnBi2, confirming that its magnetism is 1D. Ti4MnBi2 is inherently frustrated, forming near a quantum critical point (QCP) separating different temperature T = 0 phases of the J1-J2 XXZ model. 1D magnetism dominates to the lowest T, and is barely affected by weak interchain coupling. Ti4MnBi2 is the first metallic spin chain where 3D conduction electrons become strongly correlated due to their coupling to 1D magnetic moments.

Abstract: Here, we use multislice electron ptychography to quantify damage introduced by ion implantation of Er into 4H-SiC. Comparing reconstructed volumes from experiment (each 2,000 nm$^{3}$) along the implantation direction, the crystal damage is quantified and compared to pristine SiC. Using simulations, we establish that the implantation-induced static displacements limit both Er dopant and silicon vacancy detection. The corresponding damage in the experiment is found to occur up a depth of 100 nm and significantly deeper than expected from implantation simulations, ignoring crystallography. Beyond this depth, we show that silicon vacancies can be identified within the sampled volume and used to measure their local strain. Overall, these results underscore the power of multislice electron ptychography to quantify the impacts of implantation and as a tool to help guide electronic device process optimization.

Title: Adsorption of ions from aqueous solutions by ferroelectric nanoparticles
Authors: Sergei V. Kalinin, Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: The fundamental aspect of physics of ferroelectric materials is the screening of uncompensated bound charges by the dissociative adsorption of ionic charges from the environment. The adsorption of ions can be especially strong when the ferroelectric undergoes the temperature-induced transition from the paraelectric phase to the ferroelectric state. Here we demonstrate that the adsorption of ions and free radicals by the polar surface of ferroelectric nanoparticles can be very efficient in aqueous solutions due to the strong ferro-ionic coupling in the nanoparticles. Obtained results can be useful for the elaboration of alternative methods and tools for adsorption of the cations (Li+, K+, Na+, etc.), anions (Cl-, Br-, J-), and/or free radicals (CO-, NH4+, etc.) from aqueous solutions by the lead-free uniaxial ferroelectric nanoparticles. The results may become an alternative way for the environment-friendly laboratory-scale purification of different aqueous solutions from ionic contamination using controllable cyclic temperature variations.

Title: Global fixed point potential approach to frustrated antiferromagnets
Authors: Shunsuke Yabunaka, Bertrand Delamotte
Abstract: We revisit the critical behavior of classical frustrated systems using the nonperturbative renormalization group (NPRG) equation. Our study is performed within the local potential approximation of this equation to which is added the flow of the field renormalization. Our flow equations are functional to avoid possible artifacts coming from the field expansion of the fixed point potential which consists in keeping only a limited number of coupling constants. We explain in detail our numerical implementation, its advantages and the difficulties encountered in the vicinity of $d=2$. For $N$-component spins, the function $N_c(d)$ separating the regions of first and second order transitions in the $(d,N)$ plane is computed for $d$ between 4 and 2.3. Our results confirm what was previously found with cruder approximations of the NPRG equation and contradict both the fixed dimension perturbative approach and some of the results obtained within the conformal bootstrap approach.

Title: Yrast states of quantum droplets confined in a ring potential
Authors: M. Ögren, G. M. Kavoulakis
Abstract: We consider a quantum droplet which is confined in a ring potential. We investigate the so-called "yrast" state, i.e., the lowest-energy state of the droplet assuming that it has some fixed expectation value of the angular momentum. Two are the most interesting aspects of this problem, the nonlinear term -- which is partly attractive and partly repulsive -- and the periodic boundary conditions. For some range of the parameters, the attractive, or the repulsive part of the nonlinear term dominates and one gets the expected behavior. In some intermediate regime the two nonlinear terms are of comparable size. In this case both the solution, as well as the corresponding dispersion relation show an interesting behavior. Finally, we make contact with the problem of solitary-wave excitation, since the derived solutions are travelling-wave, i.e., solitary-wave, solutions.

Title: Metadensity functional theory for classical fluids: Extracting the pair potential
Authors: Stefanie M. Kampa, Florian Sammüller, Matthias Schmidt, Robert Evans
Abstract: The excess free energy functional of classical density functional theory depends upon the type of fluid model, specifically on the choice of (pair) potential, is unknown in general, and is approximated reliably only in special cases. We present a machine learning scheme for training a neural network that acts as a generic metadensity functional for truncated but otherwise arbitrary pair potentials. Automatic differentiation and neural functional calculus then yield, for one-dimensional fluids, accurate predictions for inhomogeneous states and immediate access to the pair distribution function. The approach provides a means of addressing a fundamental problem in the physics of liquids, and for soft matter design: How best to invert structural data to obtain the pair potential?

Title: Tricriticality and finite-size scaling in the triangular Blume-Capel ferromagnet
Authors: Dimitrios Mataragkas, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Dong-Hee Kim
Abstract: We report on numerical simulations of the two-dimensional spin-$1$ Blume-Capel ferromagnet embedded in a triangular lattice. Utilizing a range of Monte Carlo and finite-size scaling techniques, we explore several critical aspects along the crystal field--temperature ($\Delta, T$) transition line. Wang-Landau simulations measuring the joint density of states in combination with the method of field mixing allow us to probe the phase coexistence curve in high resolution, determining the tricritical point $(\Delta_{\rm t}, T_{\rm t})$ with improved accuracy and verifying the tricritical exponents. Extensive multicanonical simulations identifying transition points across the phase diagram characterize the Ising universality class for $\Delta < \Delta_{\rm t}$ with precise determination of thermal and magnetic critical exponents expected in the second-order regime. On the other hand, for $\Delta > \Delta_{\rm t}$, a finite-size scaling analysis is dedicated to revealing the first-order signature in the surface tension that linearly increases upon lowering the temperature deeper into the first-order transition regime. Finally, a comprehensive picture of the phase diagram for the model is presented, collecting transition points obtained from the combined numerical approach in this study and previous estimates in the literature.

Title: Non-Majorana-origin of the half-integer conductance quantization elucidated by multi-terminal superconductor-quantum anomalous Hall insulator heterostructure
Authors: Anjana Uday, Gertjan Lippertz, Bibek Bhujel, Alexey A. Taskin, Yoichi Ando
Abstract: Chiral one-dimensional transport can be realized in thin films of a surface-insulating ferromagnetic topological insulator called quantum anomalous Hall insulator (QAHI). When superconducting (SC) pairing correlations are induced in the surface of such a material by putting an $s$-wave superconductor on the top, the resulting topological superconductivity gives rise to chiral Majorana edge-modes. A quantized two-terminal conductance of $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$ was proposed as a smoking-gun evidence for the topological SC phase associated with a single chiral Majorana edge-mode. There have been experiments to address this proposal, but the conclusion remains unclear. Here, we formulate the edge transport in a multi-terminal superconductor-QAHI heterostructure using the Landauer-Büttiker formalism. Compared to the original proposal for the $\frac{1}{2}(e^2/h)$-quantization based on a simple two-terminal model, our formalism allows for deeper understanding of the origin of the quantization. The analysis of our experiments on multi-terminal devices unambiguously shows that the half-integer conductance quantization arises from the equilibration of the potentials of the incoming edge states at the SC electrode, and hence it is not of Majorana origin.

Title: Kinetic model for transport in granular mixtures
Authors: Pablo Avilés, David González Méndez, Vicente Garzó
Abstract: A kinetic model for granular mixtures is considered to study three different non-equilibrium situations. The model is based on the equivalence between a gas of elastic hard spheres subjected to a drag force proportional to the particle velocity and a gas of inelastic hard spheres. As a first problem, the relaxation of the velocity moments to their forms in the homogeneous cooling state (HCS) is studied. Then, taking the HCS as the reference state, the kinetic model is solved by the Chapman-Enskog method, which is conveniently adapted to inelastic collisions. For small spatial gradients, the mass, momentum and heat fluxes of the mixture are determined and exact expressions for the Navier-Stokes transport coefficients are obtained. As a third nonequilibrium problem, the kinetic model is solved exactly in the uniform shear flow (USF) state, where the rheological properties of the mixture are computed in terms of the parameter space of the mixture. In addition to the transport properties, the velocity distribution functions of each species are also explicitly obtained. To assess the reliability of the model, its theoretical predictions are compared with both (approximate) analytical results and computer simulations of the original Boltzmann equation. In general, the comparison shows a reasonable agreement between the two kinetic equations. While the diffusion transport coefficients show excellent agreement with the Boltzmann results, more quantitative differences appear in the case of the shear viscosity coefficient and the heat flux transport coefficients. In the case of the USF, although the model qualitatively captures the shear rate dependence of the rheological properties well, the discrepancies increase with increasing inelasticity in collisions.

Title: Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping in one dimension
Authors: Tanul Gupta, Nikolay V. Prokof'ev, Guido Pupillo
Abstract: We investigate the zero-temperature phase diagram of the one-dimensional Bose-Hubbard model with power-law hopping decaying with distance as $1/r^\alpha$ using exact large scale Quantum Monte-Carlo simulations. For all $1<\alpha\leq 3$ the quantum phase transition from a superfluid and a Mott insulator at unit filling is found to be continuous and scale invariant, in a way incompatible with the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) scenario, which is recovered for $\alpha>3$. We characterise the new universality class by providing the critical exponents by means of data collapse analysis near the critical point for each $\alpha$ and from careful analysis of the spectrum. Large-scale simulations of the grand canonical phase diagram and of the decay of correlation functions demonstrate an overall behavior akin to higher dimensional systems with long-range order in the ground state for $\alpha \leq 2$ and intermediate between one and higher dimensions for $2<\alpha \leq 3$. Our exact numerical results provide a benchmark to compare theories of long-range quantum models and are relevant for experiments with cold neutral atom, molecules and ion chains.

Title: Vision transformer based Deep Learning of Topological indicators in Majorana Nanowires
Authors: Jacob R. Taylor, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: 1D superconductor-semiconductor nanowires are leading candidates for topological quantum computation due to their ability to host Majorana zero modes (MZMs). However, standard methods for identifying MZMs are often inadequate, particularly in the presence of disorder, where many properties considered to be heralds of MZMs are often generated by trivial disorder induced Andreev bound states. Recent works clearly indicate the need for developing new techniques for identifying and diagnosing MZMs. In this study, we utilize a Vision Transformer-based neural network to predict using tunnel conductance measurements, both whether a device manifests a topological MZMs phase, and also to map out the entire topological phase diagram. We show the ability of our method up to arbitrary confidence ($P>0.9998$) classify a device as possessing a non-trivial MZM-carrying topological phase for a wide variety of disorder parameters. Further, within these regimes we demonstrate an ability to predict from conductance measurements alternative (to the extensively used scattering-matrix-invariant topological indicator) Majorana indicators based on local density of states (LDOS). This work serves as a significant advance offering a step towards the practical realization of Majorana-based quantum devices, enabling a deep-learning understanding of the topological properties in disordered nanowire systems. We validate our method using extensive simulated Majorana results in the presence of disorder, and suggest using this technique for the analysis of experimental data in superconductor-semiconductor hybrid Majorana platforms.

Title: CrystalFlow: A Flow-Based Generative Model for Crystalline Materials
Authors: Xiaoshan Luo, Zhenyu Wang, Jian Lv, Lei Wang, Yanchao Wang, Yanming Ma
Abstract: Deep learning-based generative models have emerged as powerful tools for modeling complex data distributions and generating high-fidelity samples, offering a transformative approach to efficiently explore the configuration space of crystalline materials. In this work, we present CrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model specifically developed for the generation of crystalline materials. CrystalFlow constructs Continuous Normalizing Flows to model lattice parameters, atomic coordinates, and/or atom types, which are trained using Conditional Flow Matching techniques. Through an appropriate choice of data representation and the integration of a graph-based equivariant neural network, the model effectively captures the fundamental symmetries of crystalline materials, which ensures data-efficient learning and enables high-quality sampling. Our experiments demonstrate that CrystalFlow achieves state-of-the-art performance across standard generation benchmarks, and exhibits versatile conditional generation capabilities including producing structures optimized for specific external pressures or desired material properties. These features highlight the model's potential to address realistic crystal structure prediction challenges, offering a robust and efficient framework for advancing data-driven research in condensed matter physics and material science.

Title: N\'eel vector-dependent anomalous transport in altermagnetic metal CrSb
Authors: Tianye Yu, Ijaz Shahid, Peitao Liu, Xing-Qiu Chen, Yan Sun
Abstract: Altermagnetism is a recently proposed class of collinear magnetism that combines the characteristics of both ferromagnetism and antiferromagnetism. Altermagnets are predicted to exhibit anomalous transport phenomena, such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, as observed in ferromagnets but with a vanishing net magnetic moment, akin to antiferromagnets. Despite the promising potential of altermagnetic materials for realizing these unique transport properties, progress has been limited due to the scarcity of metallic altermagnets. Motivated by the recent discovery of the altermagnetic metal CrSb, we conducted a systematic study of its electrical and thermoelectric transport properties, including the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects, using first-principles calculations. Our findings indicate that CrSb exhibits low magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, allowing for the manipulation of the Néel vector through an external electric field. We explored the anomalous Hall and Nernst conductivities as functions of the Néel vector orientation, finding that both effects reach their maximum when the Néel vector is aligned along $\frac{1}{2}$\textbf{\textit{a}}+\textbf{\textit{b}}. The origins of both conductivities were analyzed in terms of Berry curvature distribution in the Brillouin zone. Our results illustrate the Néel vector-dependent anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in an altermagnetic metal, offering an additional metallic altermagnetic platform to investigate anomalous transport properties, thereby complementing the widely studied RuO$_2$.

Title: Coexistence of $p$-wave Magnetism and Superconductivity
Authors: Pavlo Sukhachov, Hans Gløckner Giil, Bjørnulf Brekke, Jacob Linder
Abstract: The symmetry requirements for realizing unconventional compensated magnets with spin-polarized bands such as altermagnets have recently been uncovered. The most recent addition to this family of magnets is parity-odd or $p$-wave magnets. We demonstrate that $p$-wave magnets are perfectly compatible with superconductivity due to the spin polarization of their electron bands and that they induce unexpected spin transport phenomena. We first show that $p$-wave magnetism can coexist with conventional superconductivity regardless of the magnitude of the spin splitting. We then predict that $p$-wave magnets induce a charge-to-spin conversion, which can be strongly enhanced by the presence of superconductivity providing a way to probe the coexistence in experiments. Our results open a new avenue for material combinations with a synergetic relation between spintronics and superconductivity.

Title: Spin fractionalization at the edge of quantum Hall fluids induced by bulk quasiparticles
Authors: Alexander Fagerlund, Alberto Nardin, Leonardo Mazza, Eddy Ardonne
Abstract: We define a measurable spin for the edge of a lowest Landau level and incompressible fractional quantum Hall state in the presence of an Abelian or non-Abelian bulk quasiparticle. We show that this quantity takes a fractional value inherited from the fractional spin of the bulk quasiparticle. We present a geometric picture that does not rely on global symmetries of the wavefunction but is able to treat quasiparticles and edges with different shapes. We study finite-size many-body wavefunctions on the cylinder with circular quasiparticles and straight edges. Our results are supported by matrix-product-state calculations for the Laughlin and the k=3 Read-Rezayi states.

Title: A bosonic matrix product state description of Read-Rezayi states and its application to quasi-hole spins
Authors: Alexander Fagerlund, Eddy Ardonne
Abstract: We study the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi quantum Hall state by means of a purely bosonic matrix product state formulation, which is described in detail. We calculate the density profiles in the presence of bulk quasi-holes of six different types: one for each $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermion sector. From the density profiles, we calculate the (local) spins of these quasi-holes. By employing a spin-statistics relation, we obtain the exchange statistics parameters. Our results, which are entirely based on local properties of the quasi-holes, corroborate previous results obtained by explicitly braiding quasi-holes, showing that the exchange statistics can be read off from the monodromy properties of the wave functions, i.e., that the associated Berry phase vanishes. We also discuss the entanglement spectrum, to show that our bosonic matrix product state formulation correctly captures the $\mathbb{Z}_3$ parafermionic structure of the $k=3$ Read-Rezayi states.

Title: Thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions without symmetry breaking
Authors: Peter Lunts, Aavishkar A. Patel, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: We describe the evolution of low-temperature thermopower across Fermi-volume-changing quantum phase transitions in Kondo lattice models without symmetry breaking. This transition moves from a heavy Fermi liquid with a conventional Luttinger-volume large Fermi surface to a 'FL*' state, characterized by a small Fermi surface and a spin liquid with fractionalized excitations. The onset of the large Fermi surface phase is driven by the condensation of a Higgs field that carries a unit gauge charge under an emergent U(1) gauge field. We consider the case with spatially random Kondo exchange, as this leads to strange metal behavior in electrical transport. We find a large asymmetric thermopower in a 'skewed' marginal Fermi liquid, with similarities to the skewed non-Fermi liquid of Georges and Mravlje (arXiv:2102.13224). Our findings are consistent with recent observations in heavy fermion compounds (Z.-Y. Cao et al., arXiv:2408.13604), and describe an enhancement of thermopower on the large Fermi surface side as well as a non-monotonic behavior on the small Fermi surface side. Our results also apply to single-band Hubbard models and the pseudogap transition in the cuprates. In the ancilla framework, single-band models exhibit an inverted Kondo lattice transition: the small Fermi surface pseudogap state corresponds to the condensed Higgs state. This inversion results in an enhancement of thermopower on the pseudogap side in our theory, consistent with observations in the cuprates (C. Collignon et al., arXiv:2011.14927; A. Gourgout et al., arXiv:2106.05959). We argue that these observations support a non-symmetry-breaking Fermi-volume-changing transition as the underlying description of the onset of the pseudogap in the cuprates.

Title: Spectra of Magnetoroton and Chiral Graviton Modes of Fractional Chern Insulator
Authors: Min Long, Hongyu Lu, Han-Qing Wu, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: Employing the state-of-the-art time-dependent variational principle algorithm, we compute the spectra of charge neutral excitations in the $\nu=1/2$ fractional Chern insulator (FCI) on the Haldane honeycomb lattice model with hard-core bosons. The magnetoroton visualized from the dynamic density structure factor, acquire a minimum gap at finite momentum that can go soft with increasing interaction and give rise to a charge density wave (CDW) at the same wavevector. The sharper and more concentrated spectral weight of the roton mode is observed when approaching the FCI-CDW transition while the single-particle gap remains intact. We also resolve the graviton mode around $\Gamma$ point of the Brillouin zone by measuring the dynamic quadrupolar density correlations. Interestingly, we not only reveal the graviton response is chiral for a certain FCI, but also show the different chiralities of the graviton of opposite-sign Hall conductance for the first time. Our results offer the clear spectral observations of magnetoroton and chiral graviton in a lattice model of FCI and will have relevance towards the on-going experiments of tunable FCIs in quantum moiré materials.

Title: Comparing the Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect in Centrosymmetric and Noncentrosymmetric Systems: Insights from Bilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Azadeh Faridi, Reza Asgari
Abstract: Both intrinsic and extrinsic orbital Hall effects (OHE) in bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are investigated in the presence of short-range disorder using quantum kinetic theory. Bilayer TMDs provide an ideal platform to study the effects of inversion symmetry breaking on transport properties due to their unique structural and electronic characteristics. While bilayer TMDs are naturally inversion symmetric, applying a finite gate voltage to create a bias between the layers effectively breaks this symmetry. Our findings reveal that slightly away from the band edges, the extrinsic OHE becomes the dominant contribution in both inversion-symmetric and asymmetric cases, with its prominence increasing significantly as the Fermi energy rises. Furthermore, we demonstrate that breaking inversion symmetry greatly enhances the extrinsic OHE. This enhancement arises from the fundamentally distinct behavior of orbital angular momentum (OAM) in centrosymmetric systems, where intraband components vanish due to symmetry constraints. As a result, in centrosymmetric systems, only the off-diagonal components of the density matrix contribute to the extrinsic OHE. In contrast, in noncentrosymmetric systems, both diagonal and off-diagonal components play a role. Our study suggests that in experimentally relevant, highly doped systems, the OHE is predominantly extrinsic in nature, regardless of whether the system is centrosymmetric or noncentrosymmetric. Importantly, we infer that even a weakly breaking of inversion symmetry can lead to a dramatic enhancement of the OHE, a finding with significant implications for experimental investigations.

Title: The dipolar Aleppo lattice: Ground state ordering and ergodic dynamics in the absence of vertex frustration
Authors: Gopi Mahato, Davis Crater, Christian Hoyt, Duncan Miertschin, Balaram Regmi, Kevin Hofhuis, Scott Dhuey, Barat Achinuq, Francesco Caravelli, Alan Farhan
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.

Title: Quantum complexity phase transitions in monitored random circuits
Authors: Ryotaro Suzuki, Jonas Haferkamp, Jens Eisert, Philippe Faist
Abstract: Recently, the dynamics of quantum systems that involve both unitary evolution and quantum measurements have attracted attention due to the exotic phenomenon of measurement-induced phase transitions. The latter refers to a sudden change in a property of a state of $n$ qubits, such as its entanglement entropy, depending on the rate at which individual qubits are measured. At the same time, quantum complexity emerged as a key quantity for the identification of complex behaviour in quantum many-body dynamics. In this work, we investigate the dynamics of the quantum state complexity in monitored random circuits, where $n$ qubits evolve according to a random unitary circuit and are individually measured with a fixed probability at each time step. We find that the evolution of the exact quantum state complexity undergoes a phase transition when changing the measurement rate. Below a critical measurement rate, the complexity grows at least linearly in time until saturating to a value $e^{\Omega(n)}$. Above, the complexity does not exceed $\operatorname{poly}(n)$. In our proof, we make use of percolation theory to find paths along which an exponentially long quantum computation can be run below the critical rate, and to identify events where the state complexity is reset to zero above the critical rate. We lower bound the exact state complexity in the former regime using recently developed techniques from algebraic geometry. Our results combine quantum complexity growth, phase transitions, and computation with measurements to help understand the behavior of monitored random circuits and to make progress towards determining the computational power of measurements in many-body systems.

Title: Randomized Low-Rank Decompositions of Nuclear Three-Body Interactions
Authors: A. Tichai, P. Arthuis, K. Hebeler, M. Heinz, J. Hoppe, T. Miyagi, A. Schwenk, L. Zurek
Abstract: First-principles simulations of many-fermion systems are commonly limited by the computational requirements of processing large data objects. As a remedy, we propose the use of low-rank approximations of three-body interactions, which are the dominant such limitation in nuclear physics. We introduce a novel randomized decomposition technique to handle the excessively large matrix dimensions and study the sensitivity of low-rank properties to interaction details. The developed low-rank three-nucleon interactions are benchmarked in ab initio simulations of few- and many-body systems. Exploiting low-rank properties provides a promising route to extend the microscopic description of atomic nuclei to large systems where storage requirements exceed the computational capacities of the most advanced high-performance computing facilities.

Title: Structure of activity in multiregion recurrent neural networks
Authors: David G. Clark, Manuel Beiran
Abstract: Neural circuits comprise multiple interconnected regions, each with complex dynamics. The interplay between local and global activity is thought to underlie computational flexibility, yet the structure of multiregion neural activity and its origins in synaptic connectivity remain poorly understood. We investigate recurrent neural networks with multiple regions, each containing neurons with random and structured connections. Inspired by experimental evidence of communication subspaces, we use low-rank connectivity between regions to enable selective activity routing. These networks exhibit high-dimensional fluctuations within regions and low-dimensional signal transmission between them. Using dynamical mean-field theory, with cross-region currents as order parameters, we show that regions act as both generators and transmitters of activity -- roles that are often in tension. Taming within-region activity can be crucial for effective signal routing. Unlike previous models that suppressed neural activity to control signal flow, our model achieves routing by exciting different high-dimensional activity patterns through connectivity structure and nonlinear dynamics. Our analysis offers insights into multiregion neural data and trained neural networks.

Title: Doped stabilizer states in many-body physics and where to find them
Authors: Andi Gu, Salvatore F. E. Oliviero, Lorenzo Leone
Abstract: This work uncovers a fundamental connection between doped stabilizer states, a concept from quantum information theory, and the structure of eigenstates in perturbed many-body quantum systems. We prove that for Hamiltonians consisting of a sum of commuting Pauli operators (i.e., stabilizer Hamiltonians) and a perturbation composed of a limited number of arbitrary Pauli terms, the eigenstates can be represented as doped stabilizer states with small stabilizer nullity. This result enables the application of stabilizer techniques to a broad class of many-body systems, even in highly entangled regimes. Building on this, we develop efficient classical algorithms for tasks such as finding low-energy eigenstates, simulating quench dynamics, preparing Gibbs states, and computing entanglement entropies in these systems. Our work opens up new possibilities for understanding the robustness of topological order and the dynamics of many-body systems under perturbations, paving the way for novel insights into the interplay of quantum information, entanglement, and many-body systems.

Title: Photonic "hourglass" design beyond the standard bulk model of phonon decoherence
Authors: José Ferreira Neto, Benedek Gaál, Luca Vannucci, Niels Gregersen
Abstract: We study the impact of mechanical vibrations on the performance of the photonic "hourglass" structure, which is predicted to emit single photons on-demand with near-unity efficiency and indistinguishability. Previous investigations neglected the impact of vibrational modes inherent to this quasi-1D geometry, relying instead on a three-dimensional bulk assumption for the phonon modes. However, it has been shown that phonon decoherence has a much stronger impact in 1D structures as compared with bulk media. Here, we surprisingly demonstrate the robustness of the photonic hourglass design, achieving close-to-unity indistinguishability even by incorporating a detailed description of the vibrational modes. We explain this unexpected result in terms of the large Purcell enhancement of the hourglass single-photon source, which eliminates the negative effect of phonons. Our findings highlight the key role of high-Q optical cavities in mitigating the detrimental effect of phonon decoherence, even for structures of reduced dimensionality.

Title: Mesoscale properties of biomolecular condensates emerging from protein chain dynamics
Authors: Nicola Galvanetto, Miloš T. Ivanović, Simone A. Del Grosso, Aritra Chowdhury, Andrea Sottini, Daniel Nettels, Robert B. Best, Benjamin Schuler
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates form by phase separation of biological polymers and have important functions in the cell $-$ functions that are inherently connected to their physical properties. A remarkable aspect of such condensates is that their viscoelastic properties can vary by orders of magnitude, but it has remained unclear how these pronounced differences are rooted in the nanoscale dynamics at the molecular level. Here we investigate a series of condensates formed by complex coacervation that span about two orders of magnitude in molecular dynamics, diffusivity, and viscosity. We find that the nanoscale chain dynamics on the nano- to microsecond timescale can be accurately related to both translational diffusion and mesoscale condensate viscosity by analytical relations from polymer physics. Atomistic simulations reveal that the observed differences in friction $-$ a key quantity underlying these relations $-$ are caused by differences in inter-residue contact lifetimes, leading to the vastly different dynamics among the condensates. The rapid exchange of inter-residue contacts we observe may be a general mechanism for preventing dynamic arrest in compartments densely packed with polyelectrolytes, such as the cell nucleus.

Title: Dynamics of Meta-learning Representation in the Teacher-student Scenario
Authors: Hui Wang, Cho Tung Yip, Bo Li
Abstract: Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms have gained popularity for their ability to train models on new tasks using limited data. Empirical observations indicate that such algorithms are able to learn a shared representation across tasks, which is regarded as a key factor in their success. However, the in-depth theoretical understanding of the learning dynamics and the origin of the shared representation remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate the meta-learning dynamics of nonlinear two-layer neural networks trained on streaming tasks in the teacher-student scenario. Through the lens of statistical physics analysis, we characterize the macroscopic behavior of the meta-training processes, the formation of the shared representation, and the generalization ability of the model on new tasks. The analysis also points to the importance of the choice of certain hyperparameters of the learning algorithms.

Title: SOLAX: A Python solver for fermionic quantum systems with neural network support
Authors: Louis Thirion, Philipp Hansmann, Pavlo Bilous
Abstract: Numerical modeling of fermionic many-body quantum systems presents similar challenges across various research domains, necessitating universal tools, including state-of-the-art machine learning techniques. Here, we introduce SOLAX, a Python library designed to compute and analyze fermionic quantum systems using the formalism of second quantization. SOLAX provides a modular framework for constructing and manipulating basis sets, quantum states, and operators, facilitating the simulation of electronic structures and determining many-body quantum states in finite-size Hilbert spaces. The library integrates machine learning capabilities to mitigate the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimensions in large quantum clusters. The core low-level functionalities are implemented using the recently developed Python library JAX. Demonstrated through its application to the Single Impurity Anderson Model, SOLAX offers a flexible and powerful tool for researchers addressing the challenges of many-body quantum systems across a broad spectrum of fields, including atomic physics, quantum chemistry, and condensed matter physics.

Title: Optical resonators constitute a universal spin simulator
Authors: Wouter Verstraelen, Timothy C.H. Liew
Abstract: NP-hard computational problems can be efficiently recast as finding the ground state of an effective spin model. However, to date no convenient setup exists that can universally simulate all of them, even for a fixed problem size. Here we present such a setup, the universal homogeneous spin simularor (UHSS) using a series of optical (or polaritonic) resonators arranged in a chain using the geometry based on the one introduced in [Phys. Rev. Applied 21, 024057 (2024), arXiv:2306.0574(3) ]. We demonstrate by example how the simulator solves Hamiltonian Cycle and traveling salesman problems, and show that it generalises to any NP-hard problem of arbitrary size. This approach works because it allows arbitrary long-range interactions in the spin model to be mapped on an optical system with only nearest-neighbor physical interactions.

Title: Geometric Formula for 2d Ising Zeros: Examples & Numerics
Authors: Iñaki Garay, Etera R. Livine
Abstract: A geometric formula for the zeros of the partition function of the inhomogeneous 2d Ising model was recently proposed in terms of the angles of 2d triangulations embedded in the flat 3d space. Here we proceed to an analytical check of this formula on the cubic graph, dual to a double pyramid, and provide a thorough numerical check by generating random 2d planar triangulations. Our method is to generate Delaunay triangulations of the 2-sphere then performing random local rescalings. For every 2d triangulations, we compute the corresponding Ising couplings from the triangle angles and the dihedral angles, and check directly that the Ising partition function vanishes for these couplings (and grows in modulus in their neighborhood). In particular, we lift an ambiguity of the original formula on the sign of the dihedral angles and establish a convention in terms of convexity/concavity. Finally, we extend our numerical analysis to 2d toroidal triangulations and show that the geometric formula does not work and will need to be generalized, as originally expected, in order to accommodate for non-trivial topologies.

Title: Kaleidoscopic reorganization of network communities across different scales
Authors: Wonhee Jeong, Daekyung Lee, Heetae Kim, Sang Hoon Lee
Abstract: The notion of structural heterogeneity is pervasive in real networks, and their community organization is no exception. Still, a vast majority of community detection methods assume neatly hierarchically organized communities of a characteristic scale for a given hierarchical level. In this work, we demonstrate that the reality of scale-dependent community reorganization is convoluted with simultaneous processes of community splitting and merging, challenging the conventional understanding of community-scale adjustment. We provide a mathematical argument concerning the modularity function, the results from real-network analysis, and a simple network model for a comprehensive understanding of the nontrivial community reorganization process. The reorganization is characterized by a local drop in the number of communities as the resolution parameter varies. This study suggests a need for a paradigm shift in the study of network communities, which emphasizes the importance of considering scale-dependent reorganization to better understand the genuine structural organization of networks.

Title: Evidence of equilibrium dynamics in human social networks evolving in time
Authors: Miguel A. González-Casado, Andreia Sofia Teixeira, Angel Sánchez
Abstract: How do networks of relationships evolve over time? We analyse a dataset tracking the social interactions of 900 individuals over four years. Despite continuous shifts in individual relationships, the macroscopic structural properties of the network remain stable, fluctuating within predictable bounds. We connect this stability to the concept of equilibrium in statistical physics. Specifically, we demonstrate that the probabilities governing network dynamics are stationary over time, and key features like degree, edge, and triangle abundances align with theoretical predictions from equilibrium dynamics. Moreover, the dynamics satisfies the detailed balance condition. Remarkably, equilibrium persists despite constant turnover as people join, leave, and change connections. This suggests that equilibrium arises not from specific individuals but from the balancing act of human needs, cognitive limits, and social pressures. Practically, this equilibrium simplifies data collection, supports methods relying on single network snapshots (like Exponential Random Graph Models), and aids in designing interventions for social challenges. Theoretically, it offers new insights into collective human behaviour, revealing how emergent properties of complex social systems can be captured by simple mathematical models.

Title: A Sinking Approach to Explore Arbitrary Areas in Free Energy Landscapes
Authors: Zhijun Pan, Maodong Li, Dechin Chen, Yi Isaac Yang
Abstract: To address the time-scale limitations in molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, numerous enhanced sampling methods have been developed to expedite the exploration of complex free energy landscapes. A commonly employed approach accelerates the sampling of degrees of freedom associated with pre-defined collective variables (CVs), which typically tends to traverse the entire CV range. However, in many scenarios, the focus of interest is on specific regions within the CV space. This paper introduces a novel "sinking" approach that enables enhanced sampling of arbitrary areas within the CV space. We begin by proposing a gridded convolutional approximation that productively replicates the effects of metadynamics, a powerful CV-based enhanced sampling technique. Building on this, we present the SinkMeta method, which "sinks" the interior bias potential to create restraining potential "cliffs" at the grid edges. This technique can confine the exploration of CVs in MD simulations to a preset area. Our experimental results demonstrate that SinkMeta requires minimal sampling steps to estimate the free energy landscape for CV subspaces of various shapes and dimensions, including irregular two-dimensional regions and one-dimensional pathways between metastable states. We believe that SinkMeta will pioneer a new paradigm for sampling partial phase spaces, especially offering an efficient and flexible solution for sampling minimum free energy paths in high-dimensional spaces.

Title: Localization Phenomena in Large-Scale Networked Systems: Robustness and Fragility of Dynamics
Authors: Poorva Shukla, Bassam Bamieh
Abstract: We study phenomena where some eigenvectors of a graph Laplacian are largely confined in small subsets of the graph. These localization phenomena are similar to those generally termed Anderson Localization in the Physics literature, and are related to the complexity of the structure of large graphs in still unexplored ways. Using spectral perturbation theory and pseudo-spectrum analysis, we explain how the presence of localized eigenvectors gives rise to fragilities (low robustness margins) to unmodeled node or link dynamics. Our analysis is demonstrated by examples of networks with relatively low complexity, but with features that appear to induce eigenvector localization. The implications of this newly-discovered fragility phenomenon are briefly discussed.

Title: Deep learning optimal molecular scintillators for dark matter direct detection
Authors: Cameron Cook, Carlos Blanco, Juri Smirnov
Abstract: Direct searches for sub-GeV dark matter are limited by the intrinsic quantum properties of the target material. In this proof-of-concept study, we argue that this problem is particularly well suited for machine learning. We demonstrate that a simple neural architecture consisting of a variational autoencoder and a multi-layer perceptron can efficiently generate unique molecules with desired properties. In specific, the energy threshold and signal (quantum) efficiency determine the minimum mass and cross section to which a detector can be sensitive. Organic molecules present a particularly interesting class of materials with intrinsically anisotropic electronic responses and $\mathcal{O}$(few) eV excitation energies. However, the space of possible organic compounds is intractably large, which makes traditional database screening challenging. We adopt excitation energies and proxy transition matrix elements as target properties learned by our network. Our model is able to generate molecules that are not in even the most expansive quantum chemistry databases and predict their relevant properties for high-throughput and efficient screening. Following a massive generation of novel molecules, we use clustering analysis to identify some of the most promising molecular structures that optimise the desired molecular properties for dark matter detection.

Title: Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention for Adaptive Dynamics in Transformers
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: We present an approach to modifying Transformer architectures by integrating graph-aware relational reasoning into the attention mechanism, merging concepts from graph neural networks and language modeling. Building on the inherent connection between attention and graph theory, we reformulate the Transformer's attention mechanism as a graph operation and propose Graph-Aware Isomorphic Attention. This method leverages advanced graph modeling strategies, including Graph Isomorphism Networks (GIN) and Principal Neighborhood Aggregation (PNA), to enrich the representation of relational structures. Our approach captures complex dependencies and generalizes across tasks, as evidenced by a reduced generalization gap and improved learning performance. Additionally, we expand the concept of graph-aware attention to introduce Sparse GIN-Attention, a fine-tuning approach that employs sparse GINs. By interpreting attention matrices as sparse adjacency graphs, this technique enhances the adaptability of pre-trained foundational models with minimal computational overhead, endowing them with graph-aware capabilities. Sparse GIN-Attention fine-tuning achieves improved training dynamics and better generalization compared to alternative methods like low-rank adaption (LoRA). We discuss latent graph-like structures within traditional attention mechanisms, offering a new lens through which Transformers can be understood. By evolving Transformers as hierarchical GIN models for relational reasoning. This perspective suggests profound implications for foundational model development, enabling the design of architectures that dynamically adapt to both local and global dependencies. Applications in bioinformatics, materials science, language modeling, and beyond could benefit from this synthesis of relational and sequential data modeling, setting the stage for interpretable and generalizable modeling strategies.
