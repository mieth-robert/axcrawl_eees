Title: Exact solution and Luttinger liquid behavior of the quantum 1D hard rod model
Authors: Shengjie Yu, Zhaoxuan Zhu, Laurent Sanchez-Palencia
Abstract: The quantum hard rod model, a one-dimensional extension of the Lieb-Liniger model, is exactly solved using an adapted Bethe ansatz. Our solution, benchmarked against path-integral quantum Monte Carlo calculations, reveals significant corrections to the excitation spectrum and thermodynamic properties, previously overlooked by the standard excluded-volume approach. We also show that the hard rod model exhibits Luttinger liquid behavior across a wide range of parameters, at zero and finite temperature, as unveiled by correlation functions. This work provides a comprehensive framework for understanding strongly correlated regimes in dilute 1D systems, with applications to quantum wires, spin chains, and ultracold atoms.

Title: Generalized Hall Conductivities in Local Commuting Projector Models: Generalized Symmetries and Protected Surface Modes
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi
Abstract: Hall conductivities are important characterizations of phases of matter. It is known that nonzero Hall conductivities are difficult to realize in local commuting projector lattice models due to no-go theorems in (2+1)D. In this work we construct local commuting projector models in (2+1)D and (3+1)D with nonzero generalized Hall conductivities for ordinary and higher-form continuous symmetries on tensor product Hilbert space of finite local dimension. The model is given by a standard $\mathbb{Z}_N$ toric code, but the symmetries do not admit expression in terms of onsite charge operators. The symmetry do not have local charges or currents on the lattice in the absence of boundaries, but there is still notion of Hall conductivities that coincide with the continuum field theories. We construct protected gapless boundaries of the lattice models using modified Villain formalism. The generalized Hall conductivities are computed by surface currents as well as bulk flux insertion and many body Chern number.

Title: Quantized Transport of Disordered Superconducting $ν=2/3$ Fractional Quantum Hall Edges
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Hao Chen, Biao Lian
Abstract: The $\nu=2/3$ fractional quantum Hall (FQH) edge states, which have counter-propagating modes, are known to flow under relevant neutral disorders into a stable Kane-Fisher-Polchinski (KFP) renormalization group (RG) fixed point, which yields a quantized two-terminal conductance $\frac{2}{3}\frac{e^2}{h}$ consistent with the experiments. Motivated by growing interests in superconducting (SC) quantum Hall systems, we study the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge states with disordered SC proximity by generalizing the KFP analysis, which may also apply to the recently realized $\nu=2/3$ fractional Chern insulator. We show that the $\nu=2/3$ FQH edge theory has an infinite number of stable RG fixed points SC$_N$ labeled by an integer $N\in\mathbb{Z}$, each of which is driven by a relevant disordered charge-$2q_N$ SC tunneling with $q_N\in\mathbb{Z}$ depending on $N$. The $N<0$ ($N\ge0$) phases are favored by an attractive (repulsive) inter-mode interaction on the edge. We further predict that the edge states in a SC$_N$ phase with $q_N\neq0$ yields a quantized downstream resistance $R_d=\frac{h}{2q_N^2e^2}$ measurable in a FQH-SC junction. For edge states staying in the KFP phase ($N=0$ and $q_N=0$) under SC proximity, we arrive at a nonlinear $R_d\propto V^{-\alpha}$ or $T^{-\alpha}$ with voltage bias $V$ or temperature $T$, where $\alpha=4$ ($\alpha=1$) if pairing (vortex tunneling) dominates.

Title: Casimir effect in critical $\mathrm{O}(N)$ models from non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Andrea Bulgarelli, Michele Caselle, Alessandro Nada, Marco Panero
Abstract: $\mathrm{O}(N)$ vector models in three dimensions, when defined in a geometry with a compact direction and tuned to criticality, exhibit long-range fluctuations which induce a Casimir effect. The strength of the resulting interaction is encoded in the excess free-energy density, which depends on a universal coefficient: the Casimir amplitude. We present a high-precision numerical calculation of the latter, by means of a novel non-equilibrium Monte Carlo algorithm, and compare our findings with results obtained from large-$N$ expansions and from the conformal bootstrap.

Title: Leveraging recurrence in neural network wavefunctions for large-scale simulations of Heisenberg antiferromagnets: the triangular lattice
Authors: M. Schuyler Moss, Roeland Wiersema, Mohamed Hibat-Allah, Juan Carrasquilla, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo simulations have been crucial for understanding quantum many-body systems, especially when the Hamiltonian is frustrated and the ground-state wavefunction has a non-trivial sign structure. In this paper, we use recurrent neural network (RNN) wavefunction ansätze to study the triangular-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (TLAHM) for lattice sizes up to $30\times30$. In a recent study [M. S. Moss et al. arXiv:2502.17144], the authors have demonstrated how RNN wavefunctions can be iteratively retrained in order to obtain variational results for multiple lattice sizes with a reasonable amount of compute. That study, which looked at the sign-free, square-lattice antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model, showed favorable scaling properties, allowing accurate finite-size extrapolations to the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, our present results illustrate in detail the relative difficulty in simulating the sign-problematic TLAHM. We find that the accuracy of our simulations can be significantly improved by transforming the Hamiltonian with a judicious choice of basis rotation. We also show that a similar benefit can be achieved by using variational neural annealing, an alternative optimization technique that minimizes a pseudo free energy. Ultimately, we are able to obtain estimates of the ground-state properties of the TLAHM in the thermodynamic limit that are in close agreement with values in the literature, showing that RNN wavefunctions provide a powerful toolbox for performing finite-size scaling studies for frustrated quantum many-body systems.

Title: In situ photoemission study of collective electronic phase transition in VO2-based heterostructures

Abstract: We investigated the origin of collective electronic phase transitions induced at the heterointerface between monoclinic insulating (MI) VO2 and rutile metallic (RM) electron-doped VO2 layers using in situ soft x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (SXPES) on nanoscale VO2/V0.99W0.01O2 (001)R bilayers. Thanks to the surface sensitivity of SXPES, we determined the changes in the electronic structure and V-V dimerization in each constituent layer separately. The selective observation of the electronic and crystal structures in the upper VO2 layer of the bilayer indicates that the MI-phase VO2 layer undergoes a transition to the RM phase by forming the heterointerface. Detailed temperature-dependent measurements reveal that the RM-phase VO2 undergoes a transition to the MI phase with a decrease in temperature, as in the case of a VO2 single-layer film. Furthermore, during the temperature-induced phase transition in the VO2 layer, the spectra are well described by an in-plane phase separation of the RM and MI phases. These results suggest that the interface-induced transition from the MI phase to the RM phase in the VO2 layer of bilayers occurs as a collective phase transition derived from the static energy balance between the interfacial energy and the bulk free energies of the constituent layers.

Title: Parasitic RF-SQUIDs in superconducting qubits due to wirebonds
Authors: B. Berlitz, E. Daum, S. Deck, A.V. Ustinov, J. Lisenfeld
Abstract: Superconducting qubits show great promise to realize practical quantum computers from micro-fabricated integrated circuits. However, their solid-state architecture bears the burden of parasitic modes in qubit materials and the control circuitry which cause decoherence and interfere with qubits. Here, we present evidence that wirebonds, which are used to contact the micro-circuits and to realize chip-to-chip airbridges, may contain parasitic Josephson junctions. In our experiment, such a junction was enclosed in a superconducting loop and so gave rise to the formation an RF-SQUID which interfered with a nearby flux-tunable transmon qubit. Periodic signatures observed in magnetic field sweeps revealed a strong AC-dispersive coupling of the parasitic RF-SQUID to both the qubit and its readout resonator, in addition to the DC-inductive coupling between RF-SQUID and qubit. Our finding sheds light on a previously unknown origin of decoherence due to parasitic Josephson junctions in superconducing circuits.

Title: From Chern to Winding: Topological Invariant Correspondence in the Reduced Haldane Model
Authors: Ghassan Al-Mahmood, Mohsen Amini, Ebrahim Ghanbari-Adivi, Morteza Soltani
Abstract: We present an exact analytical investigation of the topological properties and edge states of the Haldane model defined on a honeycomb lattice with zigzag edges. By exploiting translational symmetry along the ribbon direction, we perform a dimensional reduction that maps the two-dimensional model into a family of effective one-dimensional systems parametrized by the crystal momentum $k_x$. Each resulting one-dimensional Hamiltonian corresponds to an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model with momentum-dependent hoppings and onsite potentials. We introduce a natural rotated basis in which the Hamiltonian becomes planar and the winding number ($\nu$) is directly computable, providing a clear topological characterization of the reduced model. This framework enables us to derive closed-form expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations across the full Brillouin zone. We show that the $\nu$ exactly reproduces the Chern number of the parent model in the topologically nontrivial phase and allows for an exact characterization of the edge modes. Analytical expressions for the edge-state wavefunctions and their dispersion relations are derived without requiring perturbative methods. Our analysis further reveals the critical momentum $ k_c $ where edge states traverse the bulk energy gap, and establishes precise conditions for the topological phase transition. In contrast to earlier models, such as plaquette-based tight-binding reductions, our method reveals hidden geometric symmetries in the extended SSH structure that are essential for understanding the topological behavior of systems with long-range hopping. Our findings offer new insight into the topological features of zigzag nanoribbons and establish a robust framework for analyzing analogous systems.

Title: All fractional Shapiro steps in the RSJ model with two Josephson harmonics
Authors: P. N. Tsarev, Ya. V. Fominov
Abstract: Synchronization between the internal dynamics of the superconducting phase in a Josephson junction (JJ) and an external ac signal is a fundamental physical phenomenon, manifesting as constant-voltage Shapiro steps in the current-voltage characteristic. Mathematically, this phase-locking effect is captured by the Resistively Shunted Junction (RSJ) model, an important example of a nonlinear dynamical system. The standard RSJ model considers an overdamped JJ with a sinusoidal (single-harmonic) current-phase relation (CPR) in the current-driven regime with a monochromatic ac component. While this model predicts only integer Shapiro steps, the inclusion of higher Josephson harmonics is known to generate fractional Shapiro steps. In this paper, we show that only two Josephson harmonics in the CPR are sufficient to produce all possible fractional Shapiro steps within the RSJ framework. Using perturbative methods, we analyze amplitudes of these fractional steps. Furthermore, by introducing a phase shift between the two Josephson harmonics, we reveal an asymmetry between positive and negative fractional steps - a signature of the Josephson diode effect.

Title: Atomic-scale ultrafast dynamics of local charge order in a THz-induced metastable state of 1T-TaS2
Authors: Luis E. Parra López, Alkisti Vaitsi, Vivien Sleziona, Fabian Schulz, Martin Wolf, Melanie Müller
Abstract: Light-induced control of quantum materials enables manipulation of electronic and structural phases on ultrafast timescales. Probing their atomic-scale dynamics is essential to understand the role of defects and domain boundaries, but conventional time-resolved techniques lack the required spatial resolution. Here, we use terahertz (THz) scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate a THz-light-induced metastable state near a defect in 1T-TaS2, and follow its photoinduced dynamics in real space and time. THz excitation induces quasi-stationary changes in the insulating gap on angstrom scales, which we associate with interlayer stacking changes. Simultaneously, THz-lightwave-driven tunneling provides access to ultrafast dynamics of the metastable state, revealing 2.5 THz oscillations of the charge density wave amplitude mode and a 1.3 THz mode attributed to an interlayer shear vibration emerging near the defect. Our results demonstrate the dual role of tip-enhanced THz fields in driving metastability and ultrafast tunneling, opening new avenues for ultrafast atomic-scale control of quantum materials.

Title: Metallic layered materials with magnetic frustration: An ARPES view of the SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ and TbAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$
Authors: P. Rezende-Gonçalves, A. Antezak, T. Kato, K. Feng, F. Fortuna, P. Le Fèvre, M. Rosmus, N. Olszowska, T. Sobol, D. J. Singh, R. E. Baumbach, A. F. Santander-Syro, E. Frantzeskakis
Abstract: Compounds of the new materials class LnTAl$_4$X$_2$ (Ln = lanthanide, X = tetrel, T = transition metal) host exotic magnetic phenomena due to geometric frustration induced by their triangular lattice. Complex spin arrangements, magnetic fluctuations and double magnetic transitions have been well observed by means of magneto-transport. Nevertheless, the experimental electronic structure of this family of materials has been poorly studied. We have investigated the experimental electronic structure of two members of this class of materials: SmAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$ and TbAuAl$_4$Ge$_2$. By means of Angle-Resolved PhotoEmission Spectroscopy (ARPES) accompanied by Density Functional Theory calculations (DFT), we reveal common trends and features, the important effect of localized spin moments on the electronic structure, the presence of surface-localized electronic states and the nature of the surface termination layer. Low-dimensionality, exchange interaction, and spin-orbit coupling are all important ingredients of the electronic structure.

Title: Static and Dynamics of Twisted Skyrmion Tubes in Frustrated Magnets
Authors: Carlos Saji, Eduardo Saavedra, Vagson L. Carvalho-Santos, Alvaro S. Nunez, Roberto E. Troncoso
Abstract: Stable three-dimensional topological skyrmion structures in frustrated magnets are investigated. The texture exhibits a helicoid pattern along the vertical direction, described by a position-dependent helicity, which interpolates between Neel- and hedgehog-like two-dimensional skyrmions, characterized by the Hopf index, and is referred to as "twisted skyrmion tubes" (TSkTs). The stability and topology of TSkTs are achieved by competing next-nearest-neighbor exchange interactions, the thickness of the magnet, and the applied magnetic field. The dynamical behavior of a twisted structure in frustrated magnets is determined. Specifically, we derive that the helicity dynamics of the TSkT can be driven by an electric current resulting from spin-orbit torque interaction. Furthermore, we address the study of the electronic scattering problem using a spin-orbit-torque-driven TSKT, which offers promising applications for low-power storage nanodevices and nanobatteries with enhanced control.

Title: Phase Doubling and Entanglement in Coherent Many-Body Chemical Reactions
Authors: Shu Nagata, Tadej Meznarsic, Chuixin Kong, Cheng Chin
Abstract: In the quantum degenerate regime, atoms and molecules can occupy a single quantum state, forming coherent matter waves. Here reactions are described by nonlinear mixing of the matter waves, giving rise to quantum many-body chemistry, where spatial coherence is preserved between the reactants and products. While the phase matching of matter waves during the reaction process has been theoretically predicted, experimental confirmation has remained elusive. Here we report on the observation of matter wave phase doubling when bosonic atoms pair into molecules. Using matter wave diffraction, we verify spatial phase coherence and observe a two-fold increase of phase in the molecular wavefunction, confirming the matter-wave version of phase doubling. The diffraction patterns also reveal non-classical correlations indicative of entangled atom pairs formed during the reaction. Our results establish molecular matter-wave diffraction as a powerful tool to probe quantum coherence and entanglement generation in chemically reactive quantum gases.

Title: Proximity engineering and interferometric quantification of a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift in zero-field polarity-reversible Josephson diodes
Authors: Kun-Rok Jeon, Jae-Keun Kim, Jiho Yoon, Jae-Chun Jeon, Hyeon Han, Audrey Cottet, Takis Kontos, Stuart S. P. Parkin
Abstract: The recent realization of zero-field polarity-reversible supercurrent rectification in proximity-magnetized Rashba(-type) Pt Josephson junctions (JJs)5 promises its practical applications for superconducting logic circuits and cryogenic memories. Here, by substituting the Pt Josephson barrier for either 5d or 4d element proximity layer with different (para-)magnetic susceptibility, spin-orbit coupling and electronic band structure, we identify the proximity role of the Josephson barrier in determining the zero-field diode properties. Ta (W) JJs reveal the zero-field diode efficiency of ~17 (~5)% at 2 K, slightly (much) smaller than that of the Pt JJs. Notably, the zero-field diode polarity of Ta and W JJs turns out to be opposite to the Pt JJs. Our results, along with a large zero-field diode efficiency found in highly magnetic-susceptible Pd JJs and a non-volatile anomalous phase-shift {\phi}_0 probed by superconducting quantum interferometry, demonstrate the {\phi}_0-tuning of zero-field diode performance via proximity engineering of interface magnetic ordering and Rashba effect.

Title: Nonlinear Transport Signatures of Hidden Symmetry Breaking in a Weyl Altermagnet
Authors: Yufei Zhao, Zhiqiang Mao, Binghai Yan
Abstract: Phase transitions in solids are often accompanied by structural changes, but subtle lattice distortions can remain hidden from conventional crystallographic probes, hindering the identification of the correct order parameters. A case in point is Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a correlated polar ruthenate with well-characterized phase transitions, whose ground state structure has recently become a subject of debate. This uncertainty stems from extremely small atomic displacements ($\sim$0.001 Å) between competing phases, beyond the resolution of X-ray diffraction, neutron scattering, or optical second-harmonic generation. In this work, we propose a method to detect hidden symmetry breaking by leveraging nonlinear transport induced by quantum geometry. We show that Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$ is a Weyl chain semimetal in both phases. The low-symmetry phase, classified as an altermagnet by symmetry, features distorted topological surface states that are asymmetric along the polar ($b$) axis. However, the nonrelativistic spin splitting is too weak ($\sim$0.1 meV) to be resolved directly, regarding the altermagnetism. In contrast, Weyl chains generate a large quantum metric at the Fermi surface, leading to nonlinear conductivities that are orders of magnitude stronger in the low-symmetry phase. A longitudinal nonlinear conductivity along the polar axis emerges exclusively in this phase, providing a sensitive probe to qualitatively distinguish it from the high-symmetry structure and demonstrate the emergence of altermangetism, which is confirmed by a recent experiment. Our work establishes a route for identifying hidden symmetry breaking in complex quantum materials through the interplay of crystal symmetry, topology and nonlinear quantum transport.

Title: A stochastic Stirling engine powered by an active particle
Authors: Erick Efrain Cote-Valencia, Juan Ruben Gomez-Solano
Abstract: We investigate a model of a stochastic engine operating cyclically at constant bath temperature, which consists of an overdamped Brownian harmonic oscillator that plays the role of working substance and is elastically coupled to an active particle. Stirling-like cycles are implemented by time-periodic changes of the active particle speed and the potential confining the oscillator. By analyzing its quasistatic and finite-time performance, we distinguish two regimes, which are determined by the relative magnitudes of the persistence time of active particle, the characteristic time of the elastic interaction, and the viscous relaxation time of the working substance. In the quasistatic limit, we derive analytic expressions for the average output work, the mean absorbed heat, and the efficiency, which explicitly involve the ratios of such three time-scales. For sufficiently large finite cycles, the different quantities characterizing the engine performance converge to their quasistatic values. For shorter cycles, the efficiencies are systematically lower, but with positive mean output powers that exhibit a maximum as a function of the cycle duration if the corresponding quasistatic mean work is positive. For sufficiently short cycles or if the quasistatic work is zero, the engine behaves at finite-time as a heat pump with negative power and efficiency.

Title: Majorana Zero Mode Induced by a Screw Dislocation on the Surface of an Iron-based Superconductor
Authors: Naoki Otsuki, Yositake Takane
Abstract: We propose a simple scenario to describe a dislocation-induced Majorana zero mode on the surface of an iron-based superconductor, using an illustrative model with a cylindrical hole of radius $R$ perpendicular to its top surface. Topological surface states on the inner surface of the hole form an effective chiral $p$-wave superconductor. When the top surface has a perpendicular magnetization, chiral Majorana modes appear near the circular edge of the hole. Since the corresponding wavefunctions obey an antiperiodic boundary condition in the circumferential direction, a Majorana zero mode at zero energy does not appear. However, if a screw dislocation is inserted through the hole, the antiperiodic boundary condition is transformed into a periodic one, resulting in the appearance of a Majorana zero mode. This Majorana zero mode remains in the no-hole limit of $R \to 0$. We confirm this scenario by numerical simulation and effective theory. A method of creating a Majorana zero mode in the absence of the surface magnetization is briefly described.

Title: Kinetic Flat-Histogram Simulations of Non-Equilibrium Stochastic Processes with Continuous and Discontinuous Phase Transitions
Authors: L. M. C. Alencar, T. F. A. Alves, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira
Abstract: As far as we know, there is no flat-histogram algorithm to sample the stationary distribution of non-equilibrium stochastic processes. The present work addresses this gap by introducing a generalization of the Wang-Landau algorithm, applied to non-equilibrium stochastic processes with local transitions. The main idea is to sample macroscopic states using a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm to generate trial moves, which are accepted or rejected with a probability that depends inversely on the stationary distribution. The stationary distribution is refined through the simulation by a modification factor, leading to convergence toward the true stationary distribution. A visitation histogram is also accumulated, and the modification factor is updated when the histogram satisfies a flatness condition. The stationary distribution is obtained in the limit where the modification factor reaches a threshold value close to unity. To test the algorithm, we compare simulation results for several stochastic processes with theoretically known behavior. In addition, results from the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm are compared with standard exact stochastic simulations. We show that the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can be applied to phase transitions in stochastic processes with bistability, which describe a wide range of phenomena such as epidemic spreading, population growth, chemical reactions, and consensus formation. With some adaptations, the kinetic flat-histogram algorithm can also be applied to stochastic models on lattices and complex networks.

Title: Highly Enhanced robust room temperature ferromagnetism in CVD-grown nano-dimensional MoS2 flakes by modifying edges and defect engineering
Authors: Sharmistha Dey, Nahid Chaudhary, Ulrich Kentsch, Rajendra Singh, Pankaj Srivastava, Santanu Ghosh
Abstract: The alterations in the magnetic properties and electronic structure of chemical vapor deposition (CVD) grown nano-dimensional molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) after low energy ion irradiation are thoroughly investigated. The formation of pure hexagonal 2-H phase has been identified by Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction (XRD). The pristine samples are irradiated by Argon (Ar) ions with low energy at different fluences. A comprehensive analysis of Raman spectroscopy data manifests the formation of lattice defects like S-vacancies across the samples after irradiation. Triangular-flake formation in the pristine sample is confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) images. After increasing irradiation fluences the big flakes commenced to fragment into smaller ones enhancing the number of edge-terminated structures. The electron probe microanalyzer (EPMA) analysis verifies the absence of any magnetic impurity. Rutherford backscattering spectrometry (RBS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) study confirm the formation of S-vacancies after irradiation. The pristine sample exhibits diamagnetic behavior at room temperature. The saturation magnetization value increases with increasing the ion irradiation fluences, and the sample irradiated with 1e15 ions/cm2 demonstrates the highest magnetization value of 4.18 emu/g. The impact of edge-terminated structure and point defects like S-vacancies to induce room-temperature ferromagnetism (RTFM) is thoroughly examined.

Title: Magnetic Field Dependence of the Spin Susceptibility on Conventional s-wave Superconductor LaRu$_4$P$_{12}$ Revealed by $^{31}$P-NMR and $^{139}$La-NMR
Authors: Riku Matsubayashi, Shiki Ogata, Taishi Ihara, Hiroyasu Matsudaira, Shunsaku Kitagawa, Kenji Ishida, Yusuke Nakai, Hitoshi Sugawara, Hideyuki Sato
Abstract: The magnetic field dependence of the spin part of Knight shift, which is proportional to the superconducting-state spin susceptibility, was investigated at two nuclear sites, $^{31}$P and $^{139}$La in a conventional s-wave superconductor LaRu$_4$P$_{12}$. After the analyses, we confirmed that the superconducting-state spin susceptibility is proportional to magnetic field, and connects to the normal-state spin susceptibility smoothly. This is a textbook example, when the superconductivity is broken with the orbital pair-breaking effect.

Title: Reconfigurable Defect States in Non-Hermitian Topolectrical Chains with Gain and Loss
Authors: S. M. Rafi-Ul-Islam, Zhuo Bin Siu, Md Saddam Hossain Razo, Mansoor B.A. Jalil
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between the non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), parity-time (PT) symmetry, and topological defect states in a finite non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain. In the conventional NHSE regime, non-reciprocal hopping leads to an asymmetric localization of all eigenstates at one edge of the system, including the bulk and topological edge states. However, the introduction of staggered gain and loss restores the symmetric localization of topological edge states while preserving the bulk NHSE. We further examine the response of defect states in this system, demonstrating that their spatial localization is dynamically controlled by the combined effects of NHSE and PT symmetry. Specifically, we identify three distinct regimes in which the defect states localize at the defect site, shift to the system's edges, or become completely delocalized. These findings extend beyond previous works that primarily explored the activation and suppression of defect states through gain-loss engineering. To validate our theoretical predictions, we propose an experimental realization using a topolectrical circuit, where non-Hermitian parameters are implemented via impedance converter-based non-reciprocal elements. Circuit simulations confirm the emergence and tunability of defect states through voltage and admittance measurements, providing a feasible platform for experimental studies of non-Hermitian defect engineering. Our results establish a route for designing reconfigurable non-Hermitian systems with controllable topological defect states, with potential applications in robust signal processing and sensing.

Title: Spatial organisation of multiple species of active particles interacting with an interface
Authors: Love Grover, Rajeev Kapri, Abhishek Chaudhuri
Abstract: We investigate the steady-state organisation of active particles residing on an interface. Particle activity induces interface deformations, while the local shape of the interface guides particle movement. We consider multiple species of particles which can locally pull on the interface or push it. This coupled system exhibits a wide variety of behaviours, including clustering, anti-clustering, diffusion, mixing, demixing, and localisation. Our findings suggest that one can control surface properties by strategically adding or removing specific particle types. Furthermore, by adjusting particle activity levels, we can selectively disperse particle types, enabling precise manipulation of surface movement and geometry.

Title: Observation of charge density wave excitonic order parameter in topological insulator monolayer WTe2

Abstract: Strong electron-hole interactions in a semimetal or narrow-gap semiconductor may drive a ground state of condensed excitons. Monolayer WTe2 has been proposed as a host material for such an exciton condensate, but the order parameter - the key signature of a macroscopic quantum-coherent condensate - has not been observed. Here we use Fourier-transform scanning tunnelling spectroscopy (FT-STS) to study quasi-particle interference (QPI) and periodic modulations of the local density of states (LDOS) in monolayer WTe2. In WTe2 on graphene, in which the carrier density can be varied via back-gating, FT-STS shows QPI features in the 2D bulk bands, confirming the interacting nature of the bandgap in neutral WTe2 and the semi-metallic nature of highly n- and p-doped WTe2. We observe additional non-dispersive spatial modulations in the LDOS imprinted on the topological edge mode of neutral WTe2 on metallic substrates (graphene and graphite), which we interpret as the interaction of the topological edge mode with the expected charge density wave order parameter of the excitonic condensate in WTe2 at low interaction strength due to screening by the metallic substrates.

Title: Ferroelastic Altermagnetism
Authors: Rui Peng, Shibo Fang, Junwei Liu, Yee Sin Ang
Abstract: Synergizing altermagnetism and other ferroic orders, such as ferroelectric switchable altermagnetism [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 106801 (2025) and ibid. 106802 (2025)], offers an effective route to achieve nonvolatile switching of altermagnetic spin splitting. In this work, by synergizing altermagnetism and ferroelasticity, we propose the concept of ferroelastic altermagnets in which the ferroelastic crystal reorientation can drive multistate nonvolatile switching of the altermagnetic spin splitting via altermagnetoelastic effect. Using monolayers RuF4 and CuF2 as material candidates, we demonstrate 2-state and 3-state altermagnetic spin splitting switching as driven by ferroelastic strain states. Transport calculation shows that multistate spin conductivities can be ferroelastically encoded in an ferroelastic altermagnet, thus suggesting the potential of ferroelastic altermagnetic as nonvolatile nanomechanical spin switches. The proposed concept of ferroelastic altermagnetism enriches the emerging landscape of multiferroic altermagnetism, paving a way towards altermagnetic-based straintronic device applications.

Title: Odd-parity magnetism by quantum geometry
Authors: Kanta Kudo, Youichi Yanase
Abstract: We study the effects of quantum geometry on parity-violating magnetism that is classified as odd-parity multipole magnetism. By comparing the spin susceptibility and odd-parity multipole susceptibility in the multisublattice model, we find that the ferroic multipole fluctuation is induced by the quantum geometry of Bloch electrons over a wide range of parameters. Due to the Hubbard interaction, the quantum-geometric multipole fluctuations condense into the multipole order. We predict complex magnetic correlations, which are a signature of quantum-geometric multipole magnetism, and propose experimental verification.

Title: Finding the right path: statistical mechanics of connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems
Authors: Damien Barbier
Abstract: We define and study a statistical mechanics ensemble that characterizes connected solutions in constraint satisfaction problems (CSPs). Built around a well-known local entropy bias, it allows us to better identify hardness transitions in problems where the energy landscape is dominated by isolated solutions. We apply this new device to the symmetric binary perceptron model (SBP), and study how its manifold of connected solutions behaves. We choose this particular problem because, while its typical solutions are isolated, it can be solved using local algorithms for a certain range of constraint density $\alpha$ and threshold $\kappa$. With this new ensemble, we unveil the presence of a cluster composed of delocalized connected solutions. In particular, we demonstrate its stability until a critical threshold $\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$ (dependent on $\alpha$). This transition appears as paths of solutions shatter, a phenomenon that more conventional statistical mechanics approaches fail to grasp. Finally, we compared our predictions to simulations. For this, we used a modified Monte-Carlo algorithm, designed specifically to target these delocalized solutions. We obtained, as predicted, that the algorithm finds solutions until $\kappa\approx\kappa^{\rm no-mem}_{\rm loc.\, stab.}$.

Title: Superstability of micrometer jets surrounded by a polymeric shell
Authors: A. Rubio, J. M. Montanero, M. Vakili, F. H. M. Koua, S. Bajt, H. N. Chapman, A. M. Gañán-Calvo
Abstract: We have produced superstable compound liquid microjets with a three-dimensional printed coaxial flow-focusing injector. The aqueous jet core is surrounded by a shell, a few hundred nanometers in thickness, of a low-concentration aqueous solution of a low-molecular-weight polymer. Due to the stabilizing effect of the polymeric shell, the minimum liquid flow rate leading to stable flow-focusing is decreased by one order of magnitude, resulting in much thinner and longer jets. Possible applications of this technique for Serial Femtosecond X-ray Crystallography are discussed.

Title: Determination of melting temperature of hexagonal ice using Lee-Yang phase transition theory
Authors: Ling Liu, Yihua Dong, Qijun Ye, Xin-Zheng Li
Abstract: Lee-Yang phase transition theory is a milestone in statistical physics. Its applications in realistic systems, however, had been substantially hindered by availability of practical schemes to calculate the Lee-Yang zeros. In this manuscript, we extend the scheme we have designed earlier [Phys. Rev. E 109, 024118 (2024)] and report simulation results for the melting temperature (T) of ice Ih under ambient pressure. The enhanced sampling technique is shown to be crucial for accessing Lee-Yang zeros accurately. The real and imaginary parts of our Lee-Yang edges demonstrate linear scaling of sizes, which can lead to a melting T of 248.15 K for the TIP4P/2005 potential in the thermodynamic limit. This result is in close quantitative agreement with previous coexistence simulations, achieved with cheaper computational costs and without prior knowledge of the phase transition. With these, we demonstrate the applicability of Lee-Yang phase transition theory in realistic molecular systems, and provide a feasible scheme for high-throughput calculations in determining the phase transition temperature.

Title: Effect of magnetic field and light on energy levels of (1+3+1) chirally twisted multilayer graphene system
Authors: Nadia Benlakhouy, Ahmed Jellal, Hocine Bahlouli, Pablo Díaz, David Laroze
Abstract: We study the Hofstadter butterfly spectrum in (1+3+1) chirally twisted multilayer graphene (CTMLG) subject to perpendicular magnetic field and light with different polarizations. We focus on the interplay between twist angles and light-induced effects. In equilibrium, we examine symmetric ($\theta_1 = \theta_2$) and asymmetric ($\theta_1 \neq \theta_2$) configurations. Our results show that asymmetric configurations cause distinct effects in the electronic energy spectrum. However, the unique symmetry of the system ensures that the spectra remain identical when the twist angles are interchanged. This highlights the role of interlayer coupling in shaping the electronic structure of CTMLG. We then explored the effects of external periodic perturbations, such as circularly polarized light (CPL) and waveguide-generated linearly polarized light (WGL). CPL breaks chiral symmetry, creating a gap that distorts the Hofstadter spectrum. These distortions are more pronounced for asymmetric twist configurations. In contrast, WGL preserves chiral symmetry and has a tunable, non-monotonic effect on the bandwidth. This makes WGL a reliable tool for engineering electronic properties. These results demonstrate how (1+3+1)-CTMLG combines the effects of light-matter interactions with moiré physics. This allows accurate control of the electronic properties and fractal spectra by adjusting external fields and twist angles.

Title: Simulating generalised fluids via interacting wave packets evolution
Authors: Andrew Urilyon, Leonardo Biagetti, Jitendra Kethepalli, Jacopo De Nardis
Abstract: One-dimensional integrable and quasi-integrable systems display, on macroscopic scales, a universal form of transport known as Generalized Hydrodynamics (GHD). In its standard Euler-scale formulation, GHD mirrors the equations of a two-dimensional compressible fluid but ignores fluctuations and becomes numerically unwieldy as soon as integrability-breaking perturbations are introduced. We show that GHD can be efficiently simulated as a gas of semiclassical wave packets - a natural generalisation of hard-rod particles - whose trajectories are efficiently mapped onto those of point particles. This representation (i) provides a transparent route to incorporate integrability-breaking terms, and (ii) automatically embeds the exact fluctuating-hydrodynamics extension of GHD. The resulting framework enables fast, large-scale simulations of quasi-integrable systems even in the presence of complicated integrability-breaking perturbations. It also manifest the pivotal role of two-point correlations in systems confined by external potentials: we demonstrate that situations where local one-point observables appear thermalised can nevertheless sustain long-lived, far-from-equilibrium long-range correlations for arbitrarily long times, signaling that, differently from what previously stated, true thermalisation is not reached at diffusive time-scales.

Title: The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of active suspensions
Authors: Pierre Gaspard
Abstract: Active suspensions composed of self-propelled colloidal particles are considered. Their propulsion of is generated by chemical reactions occurring by heterogeneous catalysis and diffusiophoresis coupling the concentration gradients of reacting molecular species to the fluid velocity. By this mechanism, chemical free energy is transduced into mechanical motion. The non-equilibrium thermodynamics of such active suspensions is developed by explicitly taking into account the internal degrees of freedom of active particles, which are the Eulerian angles specifying their orientation. Accordingly, the distribution function of colloidal particles is defined in the six-dimensional configuration space of their position and their orientation, which fully characterises polar, nematic, and higher orientational orders in the active system. The local Gibbs and Euler thermodynamic relations are expressed in terms of the colloidal distribution function, the dynamics of which is ruled by a six-dimensional local conservation equation. All the processes contributing to the entropy production rate are derived from the local conservation and kinetic equations for colloids, molecular species, mass, linear momentum, and energy, identifying their thermodynamic forces, also called affinities, and their dissipative current densities. The non-equilibrium constitutive relations are obtained using the Curie symmetry principle and the Onsager-Casimir reciprocal relations based on microreversibility. In this way, all the mechanochemical coupling coefficients are completely determined for isothermal, incompressible, dilute suspensions composed of spherical Janus particles on the basis of the interfacial properties between the fluid solution and the solid particles and chemohydrodynamics. The complete expression of the entropy production rate is established for such active systems.

Title: Nonreciprocal and long-range three-body interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates induced by optical feedback
Authors: Yi-Qing Zhang, Liang-Jun He, Han Pu, Zheng-Wei Zhou, Yong-Chang Zhang
Abstract: We propose generating long-range and nonreciprocal three-body interactions in quantum gases via optical feedback. By placing a quasi-two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) in front of two reflecting mirrors and illuminating it with dichromatic laser beams, these driving optical fields traverse the BEC twice, thereby inducing a feedback effect on the atoms. We demonstrate that this optical feedback gives rise to an effective three-body atom-atom interaction with remarkable long-range and nonreciprocal properties. Due to its long-range nature, this three-body interaction can cause unique spatial symmetry-breaking behaviors in the BEC, resulting in various stable stationary states as well as unexpected diffusive collapse. Notably, a distinct ring state emerges through a purely self-organizing process. Furthermore, by analyzing the real-time dynamics of the BEC, we show that the nonreciprocal nature of this interaction can lead to intriguing self-acceleration of the condensate, seemingly violating Newton's law of motion. Additionally, our scheme offers a highly controllable setting, where pairwise two-body interactions can be tuned to vanish. This flexibility provides a promising route for exploring exotic physics associated with multi-body interactions.

Title: Polaron formation as the vertex function problem: From Dyck's paths to self-energy Feynman diagrams
Authors: Tomislav Miškić, Juraj Krsnik, Andrey S. Mishchenko, Osor S. Barišić
Abstract: We present a novel iterative method for generating all self-energy Feynman diagrams of any given order for the single polaron problem. This approach offers an effective tool for circumventing the sign problem that often arises in approximation-free numerical summations of Feynman diagrams. Each iterative step begins by rigorously listing all noncrossing diagrams using the graphical Dyck path representation of Stieltjes-Rogers polynomials, which exactly encode the Feynman diagram series. In the second phase, the Ward-Takahashi identity is used to uniquely identify the complete subset of vertex function contributions from the self-energy diagrams obtained in the previous iterative step. Finally, the noncrossing diagrams and vertex function contributions are combined to construct the full set of Feynman diagrams at a given order of the diagrammatic expansion, determining the number of diagrams of various types. This approach establishes a systematic procedure for generating the total sum of diagrams in a given order, enabling significant sign cancellation and making it broadly suitable for numerical summation techniques involving Feynman diagrams.

Title: Pseudomagnetotransport in Strained Graphene
Authors: Alina Mreńca-Kolasińska, Christophe De Beule, Jia-Tong Shi, Aitor Garcia-Ruiz, Denis Kochan, Klaus Richter, Ming-Hao Liu
Abstract: In graphene, long-wavelength deformations that result in elastic shear strain couple to the low-energy Dirac electrons as pseudogauge fields. Using a scalable tight-binding model, we consider analogs to magnetotransport in mesoscopic strained graphene devices with nearly uniform pseudomagnetic fields. In particular, we consider transverse pseudomagnetic focusing in a bent graphene ribbon and show that a focused valley-polarized current can be generated with characteristic conductance oscillations. Importantly, our scaling method allows for quantum transport calculations with realistic device geometries, and leaves the Dirac physics and pseudogauge fields invariant as long as the atomic displacements vary slowly with respect to the scaled lattice. Our results show that pseudomagnetotransport is a promising new route for graphene straintronics, and our scaling method provides a new framework for the modeling, design, and interpretation of straintronics experiments and applications.

Title: In-situ nanoscale transport measurements on monoatomic metal films by low-temperature scanning tunneling potentiometry
Authors: Masayuki Hamada, Masahiro Haze, Junya Okazaki, Yukio Hasegawa
Abstract: Investigation of transport properties is fundamental for characterizing electronic properties and phase transitions. However, most of the transport measurements on conductive layers have been performed at macroscopic scales, and thus the development of microscopic methods to measure transport is important. Scanning tunneling potentiometry (STP) is a powerful tool for investigating surface conductivity at nano-scale spatial resolutions. However, it is still challenging to conduct STP studies at low temperatures and most of the low-temperature studies were performed on samples that were prepared ex-situ. In this study, we developed a low-temperature STP and demonstrated its performance on monoatomic metal films formed on Si(111) substrates that were prepared in-situ. Stable operation at low temperatures enables us to extract the electrochemical potential originating from the surface transport by canceling out the potential due to thermal differences and artifacts arising from the nonlinearity of the density of states (DOS). We also formulated the nonlinear-DOS artifact and confirmed it by comparing with the nonlinearity obtained by scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: Hydrostatic pressure studies on non-superconducting UTe2
Authors: M. O. Ajeesh, Joe D. Thompson, Eric D. Bauer, Filip Ronning, Sean M. Thomas, Priscila F. S. Rosa
Abstract: We report the temperature-pressure phase diagram of a UTe$_2$ single crystal that does not undergo a bulk superconducting transition but shows filamentary superconductivity with a critical transition temperature of 1 K at ambient pressure. Electrical-resistivity measurements reveal that the evolution of the filamentary superconducting state under pressure resembles the behavior observed in previous reports on bulk superconducting samples. AC calorimetry, however, does not show evidence for either bulk superconductivity or magnetism for pressures up to 1.6 GPa. Our results highlight the role of inhomogeneity in chemical-vapor-transport-grown UTe$_2$ samples and serve as a cautionary tale when probing electrical resistivity alone.

Title: Ordered buckling structures in a twisted crimped tube
Authors: Pan Dong, Nathan C. Keim, Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: When a ribbon or tube is twisted far enough it forms buckles and wrinkles. Its new geometry can be strikingly ordered, or hopelessly disordered. Here we study this process in a tube with hybrid boundary conditions: one end a cylinder, and the other end crimped flat like a ribbon, so that the sample resembles a toothpaste tube. The resulting irregular structures and mechanical responses can be dramatically different from those of a ribbon. However, when we form two creases in the tube prior to twisting, we obtain an ordered structure composed of repeating triangular facets oriented at varying angles, and a more elastic torque response, reminiscent of the creased helicoid structure of a twisted ribbon. We measure how the torque and structural evolution depend on parameters such as material thickness and the twist angle. When only part of the tube is pre-creased, the ordered structures are confined to this segment. Surprisingly, in some tubes made from thicker sheets, an ordered structure forms without pre-creasing. This study provides insights into controlling the buckling of thin shells, offering a potential pathway for designing ordered structures in soft materials.

Title: Modeling of Water Evaporation in Hydrogels from Aspect of Mechanical Analytics
Authors: Zehua Yu, Yongshun Ren, Kang Liu
Abstract: Water evaporation is critically important for hydrogels in open-air applications, but theoretically modeling is difficult due to the complicated intermolecular interactions and sustained deformation. In this work, we construct a simplified model to describe the state of water inside the hydrogel by only considering mechanical stretching. We employ "negative pressure" to bridge the stretching force in water and elastic force generated by the polymer network. Combined with a constitutive equation of elasticity for hydrogels and classic diffusion equation, this model gives a universal solution to calculate the saturated vapor pressure, dynamic evaporation rates and real-time deformation of different hydrogels. The calculated results agree well with experiments results both in steady state and dynamic process for commonly used poly 2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate and polyacrylamide hydrogels with diverse components. In addition, the model predicts that, hydrogels with high modulus shows stronger ability to retain water in open environment.

Title: Anomalous supercurrents in the presence of particle losses
Authors: Risa Ogino, Shun Uchino
Abstract: We show that supercurrent properties in a superfluid or superconducting junction are significantly modified due to single-particle losses present in a conduction channel. In the presence of a spin-independent particle loss, we find regimes where the Josephson current $I_N(\phi)$ takes zero at a position in between $\phi= 0$ and $\phi=\pi$, and the direction of the supercurrent is reversed. Although the region is narrow, we also find a regime in which the critical current is enhanced by dissipation. Such anomalous behaviors in the Josephson current are attributed to a subtle interplay between the contribution that is present regardless of dissipation and the unconventional one that is absent without dissipation. In the presence of a spin-selective particle loss, it is shown that a dissipation-induced spin supercurrent and its reversal occur. The proposed system is analyzed by means of the Keldysh field theory approach based on the Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudershan-Lindblad master equation and may be realized in ultracold atomic gases and solid-state systems.

Title: Ultrafast atomic dimerization of Peierls distortion in semimetal molybdenum ditelluride
Authors: Zhong Wang, Chunlong Hu, Changchang Gong, Fuyong Hua, Qian You, Wenxi Liang
Abstract: Semimetal molybdenum ditelluride (1T'-MoTe$_2$) possess diverse phase transitions enriching its application prospects. The structural response during these transitions is crucial to understanding the underlying mechanisms, but the desired details of pathway and time span are still insufficient. Here, we investigate the lattice evolution in few-layer 1T'-MoTe$_2$ after photoexcitation, using ultrafast electron diffraction and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The observed complex lattice responses with unintuitively evolving Bragg peak intensity and interplanar spacing, are best interpreted as the combination of shear displacement and Mo-Mo bond shortening in a few picoseconds, and a metastable structure in nanoseconds, basing on the analyses of structure factor and pair distribution function. The DFT calculations reveal that, the photodoped electrons induced population change of the antibonding states close to Fermi level, lead to the shear displacement and the dimerization of Mo pairs. Our findings present new insights for elucidating the picture of Peierls distortion in 1T'-MoTe$_2$.

Title: Stability of binary Bose mixtures with attractive intercomponent interactions
Authors: Abdulla Rakhimov, Sanathon Tukhtasinova, Vyacheslav I. Yukalov
Abstract: In 2015 Dmitry Petrov theoretically predicted that, in binary mixture of bosons a quantum liquid droplet may arise due to the competition between attractive intercomponent and repulsive intracomponent forces. Although this prediction has been confirmed experimentally, the model by itself suffers from a serious conceptual problem: The low - lying excitation spectrum manifests a purely imaginary phonon velocity, $c_d^2 < 0$. In present work we develop self consistent theory of two component Bose system with attractive inter species interaction, which accurately takes into account pair correlations in terms of anomalous and mixed densities. We have shown that this procedure is able to resolve the problem of $c_d^2 < 0$. Limiting ourselves with a symmetric Bose mixture at zero temperature, we have found a region of stability in which a droplet may survive.

Title: Optically detected magnetic resonance of wafer-scale hexagonal boron nitride thin films

Novikov, Jan Mischke, Sergej Pasko, Emre Yengel, Alexander Henning, Simonas Krotkus, Andrzej Wysmołek, Jean-Philippe Tetienne
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) has recently been shown to host native defects exhibiting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with applications in nanoscale magnetic sensing and imaging. To advance these applications, deposition methods to create wafer-scale hBN films with controlled thicknesses are desirable, but a systematic study of the ODMR properties of the resultant films is lacking. Here we perform ODMR measurements of thin films (3-2000nm thick) grown via three different methods: metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD), chemical vapour deposition (CVD), and molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We find that they all exhibit an ODMR response, including the thinnest 3nm film, albeit with different characteristics. The best volume-normalised magnetic sensitivity obtained is 30uT/sqrt(Hz um^3). We study the effect of growth temperature on a series of MOCVD samples grown under otherwise fixed conditions and find 800-900C to be an optimum range for magnetic sensitivity, with a significant improvement (up to two orders of magnitude) from post-growth annealing. This work provides a useful baseline for the magnetic sensitivity of hBN thin films deposited via standard methods and informs the feasibility of future sensing applications.

Title: Factor of 1000 suppression of the depolarization rate in ultracold thulium collisions

Abstract: Lanthanides are nowadays extensively used to investigate the properties of strongly correlated matter. Nevertheless, exploiting the Zeeman manifold of a lanthanide atom ground state is challenging due to the unavoidable presence of depolarization collisions. Here we demonstrate that in the case of the thulium atom, it is possible to suppress this depolarization by a factor of 1000 with a carefully tuned magnetic field thus opening the way for the efficient use of the Zeeman manifold in quantum simulations.

Title: Atomistic and experimental study of microstructural evolution in nanocrystalline iron subjected to irradiation
Authors: Ivan Tolkachev, Daniel R. Mason, Max Boleininger, Pui-Wai Ma, Daniel Long, Eamonn T. Connolly, Stephen P. Thompson, Kenichiro Mizohata, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Nanocrystalline materials have been proposed for use in future fusion reactors due to their high grain boundary density that may act as a sink for irradiation-induced defects. We use molecular dynamics to model collision cascades in nanocrystalline iron and compare the damage evolution to that observed in initially perfect, single crystalline iron. The nanocrystalline material is generated either by Voronoi tessellation or severe plastic shearing. Upon irradiation, the grains in nanocrystalline simulations coarsen, with all ultimately becoming single crystalline above 2 dpa. Above a damage dose of 1 dpa, nanocrystalline cells show a lower dislocation density and lower lattice swelling than their initially pristine counterparts. Experimental X-ray diffraction data is collected on nanocrystalline iron samples subjected to self-ion irradiation. Line profile analysis data agrees with the trends observed in the atomistic simulations, revealing the presence of an irradiation induced annealing process, with a clear reduction in micro-strain with increasing dose. We attempt to determine why some grains in our atomistic simulations grow, while others shrink, by creating a Toy Model that simulates volume exchange between grains based on different hypothesised exchange mechanisms. This suggests that irradiation-induced grain growth is consistent with random growth.

Title: Disentangling the Roles of Dissolved Oxygen, Common Salts, and pH on the Spontaneous Hydrogen Peroxide Production in Water: No O2, No H2O2
Authors: Muzzamil Ahmad Eatoo, Himanshu Mishra
Abstract: Despite the mounting evidence proving that the air-water interface or the microdroplet geometry has nothing to do with the spontaneous formation of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), the myth persists. Three recent studies by George and co-workers give credence to the myth by showing connections between the spontaneous formation of hydroxyl (HO) radicals and hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) in sprayed microdroplets with the solution pH, dissolved salts, nebulizing gas, and the gaseous environment. They report that among halides (chloride, bromide, and iodide), bromide dominates the H2O2 formation because of its ability to donate electrons. Also, they conclude that the H2O2 production at the air-water interface scales with waters alkalinity. In response, we apply a broad set of techniques, spanning NMR, potentiodynamic polarization, electron microscopy, and hydrogen peroxide assay kit (HPAK) fluorometry, to reexamine these claims. Our experiments reveal that regardless of the halide present in water, the air-water interface or the microdroplet geometry does not drive the H2O2 formation. It is the reduction of O2 at the solid-water interface that produces H2O2, i.e., in the absence of O2, no H2O2 is formed regardless of the halide ions. We explain the relative dependence of H2O2 concentrations on the halides based on their propensity to drive pitting corrosion (Chloride > Bromide > Iodide). As the pits appear in the passivating layer, exposing the metal, H2O2 is consumed in further oxidation. Next, we disprove the claim of alkalinity-driven H2O2 formation by demonstrating that aluminum and titanium surfaces produce more H2O2 in acidic and alkaline conditions, respectively. Taken together, these findings refute the conclusions of George and co-workers and others regarding spontaneous H2O2 generation at the air-water interface. The following mnemonic captures our conclusion: no O2, no H2O2.

Title: Hydrodynamics in generalized electronic two-band systems
Authors: E. Di Salvo, P. Cosme, L. Fritz
Abstract: In this paper, we derive the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations for electronic two-band systems in arbitrary dimension and with generic power-law dispersion relations. We focus on the hydrodynamic transport regime, where such systems offer a unique tunability between a Fermi-liquid type regime at high doping and the inherent two-band physics of the low-density system close to the Dirac-type band-touching point. For a generic dispersion, the absence of Euclidean or Lorentzian invariance leads to novel types of hydrodynamic equations. We characterize these novel hydrodynamic regimes through dimensionless numbers, such as the Prandtl and Lorenz numbers, or the ratio between shear viscosity and entropy density. In all cases, we provide a derivation of the physics of the long-wavelength plasmonic modes.

Title: Spectroscopy and Ground-State Transfer of Ultracold Bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Molecules
Authors: Krzysztof P. Zamarski, Charly Beulenkamp, Yi Zeng, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: We report on the creation of ultracold samples of $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules in their rovibrational ground state. By investigating potentially suitable excited states using one- and two-photon spectroscopy, we have identified a pathway to the ground state via an exceptionally narrow intermediate state. Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), we create trapped samples of up to 3500 molecules at temperatures of 1 $\mu$K with one-way efficiencies of 71%. The lifetime of these samples is limited by a universal-rate two-body loss process, which could shed new light on similar loss mechanisms in other molecular species. Our results are a step towards establishing an alternative platform for the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions.

Title: Functional renormalization group approach to phonon modified criticality: anomalous dimension of strain and non-analytic corrections to Hooke's law
Authors: Max O. Hansen, Julia von Rothkirch, Peter Kopietz
Abstract: We study the interplay between critical isotropic elasticity and classical Ising criticality using a functional renormalization group (FRG) approach which is implemented such that the volume is fixed during the entire renormalization group flow. For dimensions slightly smaller than four we use a simple truncation of the FRG flow equations to recover the fixed points of the constrained Ising model: the Gaussian fixed point G, the Ising fixed point I, the renormalized Ising fixed point R, and the spherical fixed point S. We show that the fixed points R and S are both characterized by a finite anomalous dimension $y_{\ast}<0$ of strain fluctuations, implying that the energy dispersion of longitudinal acoustic phonons exhibits a non-analytic momentum dependence proportional to $k^{1-y_{\ast}/2}$ for small momentum $k$. We also derive and solve flow equations for the free energy at constant strain and compute stress-strain relations in the vicinity of the fixed points. As a result, we reaffirm that Ising criticality, controlled by the fixed point I, is preempted by a bulk instability. Beyond that, we find that the stress-strain relation at R and S remains linear to leading order (Hooke's law), as long as the interaction between strain and Ising fluctuations is sufficiently weak. However, the finite anomalous dimension of strain fluctuations $y_{\ast}$ gives rise to non-analytic corrections to Hooke's law.

Title: Large strain contribution to the laser-driven magnetization response of magnetostrictive TbFe$_{2}$
Authors: C. Walz, F.-C. Weber, S.-P. Zeuschner, K. Dumesnil, A. von Reppert, M. Bargheer
Abstract: We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.

Title: Charge Carrier Mobilities in gamma-Graphynes: A computational approach

Abstract: Graphynes, a class of two-dimensional carbon allotropes, exhibit exceptional electronic properties, similar to graphene, but with intrinsic band gaps, making them promising for semiconducting applications. The incorporation of acetylene linkages allows for systematic modulation of their properties. However, the theoretical characterization of graphynes remains computationally demanding, particularly for electron-phonon coupling (EPC) analyses. Here, we employ the density functional tight binding method within the DFTBephy framework, providing an efficient and accurate approach for computing EPC and transport properties. We investigate the structural, mechanical, electronic, and transport properties of graphynes, comparing transport calculations using the constant relaxation-time approximation and the self-energy relaxation-time approximation (SERTA) alongside analytical models based on parabolic- and Kane-band approximations. For graphyne, the SERTA relaxation time is 0.63 (1.69) ps for holes (electrons). In graphdiyne, the relaxation time is 0.04 (0.14) ps for holes (electrons). While the hole mobilities in graphyne are on the order of 10$^3$ cm$^2/$Vs, the electron mobilities reach up to 10$^4$ cm$^2/$Vs. In graphdiyne, the mobility values for both types of charge carriers are on the order of 10$^2$ cm$^2/$Vs. The phonon-limited mobilities at room temperature in graphyne fall between those of graphene and MoS$_2$, while in graphdiyne, they are comparable to those of MoS$_2$.

Title: From Polyhedra to Crystals: A Graph-Theoretic Framework for Crystal Structure Generation
Authors: Tomoyasu Yokoyama, Kazuhide Ichikawa, Hisashi Naito
Abstract: Crystal structures can be viewed as assemblies of space-filling polyhedra, which play a critical role in determining material properties such as ionic conductivity and dielectric constant. However, most conventional crystal structure prediction methods rely on random structure generation and do not explicitly incorporate polyhedral tiling, limiting their efficiency and interpretability. In this highlight, we introduced a novel crystal structure generation method based on discrete geometric analysis of polyhedral information. The geometry and topology of space-filling polyhedra are encoded as a dual periodic graph, and the corresponding crystal structure is obtained via the standard realization of this graph. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by reconstructing face-centered cubic (FCC), hexagonal close-packed (HCP), and body-centered cubic (BCC) structures from their dual periodic graphs. This method offers a new pathway for systematically generating crystal structures based on target polyhedra, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel materials for applications in electronics, energy storage, and beyond.

Title: Strain controlled g- to d-wave transition in altermagnetic CrSb
Authors: Bennet Karetta, Xanthe H. Verbeek, Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Libor Šmejkal, Jairo Sinova
Abstract: The possibility of a strain-induced transformation from $g$-wave to $d$-wave altermagnetism was recently recently proposed for MnTe using a $k\cdot p$ perturbative model. In this work, we demonstrate such a transition in CrSb for a wider array of strains, using a combination of a minimal model and first-principles calculations. Starting from a symmetry perspective, we analyze the spin elastoconductivity tensor, and determine the strain types which allow for a change in the altermagnetic symmetry. We obtain three strain directions, which allow for a $d$-wave type splitting, and one in which a net magnetic moment emerges. Using first-principles calculations in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we confirm these symmetry predictions. Furthermore, these results do not alter qualitatively in the presence of SOC. Finally, we reveal that the resulting spin currents give rise to a spin-splitter effect of up to 5\% under realistic strains of 1\%, confirming strain as a powerful tool for tuning altermagnetic properties.

Title: Graphene/hBN heterostructure based Valley transistor: Dynamic Control of valley current in synchronized nonzero voltages, within the time-dependent regime
Authors: A. Belayadi, C. I. Osuala, I. Assi, A. Naif, J. P. F. LeBlanc, A. Abbout
Abstract: Graphene/hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) heterostructures represent a promising class of metal-insulator-semiconductor systems widely explored for multifunctional digital device applications. In this work, we demonstrate that graphene, when influenced by carrier-dependent trapping in the hBN spacer triggered by a localized potential from Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM), can exhibit valley transistor behavior under specific conditions. We employ a tight-binding model that self-consistently incorporates a Gaussian-shaped potential to represent the effect of the tip gate. Crucially, we show that the heterostructure functions as a field-effect transistor (FET), with its operation governed by the bias gate (shifting the Fermi level) and the tip-induced potential (breaking electron-hole symmetry via selective trapping of electron or hole quasiparticles). Our results reveal that, under specific lattice geometry, pulse frequency, and gate voltage conditions, the device exhibits valley transistor functionality. The valley current (e.g., I_K1=-K or I_K2=+K) can be selectively controlled by synchronizing the frequencies and polarities of the tip and bias gate voltages. Notably, when both gates are driven with the same polarity, the graphene channel outputs a periodically modulated, pure valley-polarized current. This enables switching between distinct ON/OFF valley current states even at finite bias. Remarkably, when the I_K1=-K current is ON (forward current), the I_K2=+K current is OFF. Reversing the gate polarity inverts this behavior: I_K1=-K turns OFF, while I_K2=+K turns ON (reverse current). These findings pave the way toward low-voltage valley transistors in metal-insulator-semiconductor architectures, offering new avenues for valleytronics and advanced gating technologies.

Abstract: Information can be stored in magnetic materials by encoding with the direction of the magnetic moment of elements. A figure of merit for these systems is the energy needed to change the information rewrite the storage by changing the magnetic moment. Organic molecules offer a playground to manipulate spin order, with metallo molecular interfaces being a promising direction for sustainable devices. Here, we demonstrate a spin reorientation transition in molecular interfaces of high magnetisation 3d ferromagnetic films due to a competition between a perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) induced by a heavy metal that dominates at high temperatures, and an in-plane anisotropy generated by molecular coupling at low temperatures. The transition can be tuned around room temperature by varying the ferromagnet thickness (1.4 to 1.9 nm) or the choice of molecular overlayer, with the organic molecules being C60, hydrogen and metal (Cu, Co) phthalocyanines. Near the transition temperature, the magnetisation easy axis can be switched with a small energy input, either electrically with a current density of 10^5 A per cm2, or optically by a fs laser pulse of fluence as low as 0.12 mJ per cm2, suggesting heat assisted technology applications. Magnetic dichroism measurements point toward a phase transition at the organic interface being responsible for the spin reorientation transition.

Title: Current-induced spin and orbital polarization in the ferroelectric Rashba semiconductor GeTe
Authors: Sergio Leiva-Montecinos, Libor Vojáček, Jing Li, Mairbek Chshiev, Laurent Vila, Ingrid Mertig, Annika Johansson
Abstract: The Edelstein effect is a promising mechanism for generating spin and orbital polarization from charge currents in systems without inversion symmetry. In ferroelectric materials, such as Germanium Telluride (GeTe), the combination of bulk Rashba splitting and voltage-controlled ferroelectric polarization provides a pathway for electrical control of the sign of the charge-spin conversion. In this work, we investigate current-induced spin and orbital magnetization in bulk GeTe using Wannier-based tight-binding models derived from \textit{ab initio} calculations and semiclassical Boltzmann theory. Employing the modern theory of orbital magnetization, we demonstrate that the orbital Edelstein effect entirely dominates its spin counterpart. This difference is visualized through the spin and orbital textures at the Fermi surfaces, where the orbital moment surpasses the spin moment by one order of magnitude. Moreover, the orbital Edelstein effect remains largely unaffected in the absence of spin-orbit coupling, highlighting its distinct physical origin compared to the spin Edelstein effect.

Title: A Thermally Modulated SINIS Trasconductance Amplifier
Authors: Giacomo Trupiano, Giorgio De Simoni, Francesco Giazotto
Abstract: We introduce a superconducting transconductance amplifier based on the thermal modulation of a SINIS (Superconductor-Insulator-Normal metal-Insulator-Superconductor) configuration. The device is composed of a normal metal island interfaced with two superconducting leads through tunnel barriers, establishing a voltage-biased symmetric SINIS setup. An additional NIS junction connects the island to a third superconducting lead, which serves as input. When the input voltage surpasses the superconducting gap, the resultant injection of quasiparticles increases the electronic temperature of the island, thereby modulating the SINIS current. We perform numerical analyzes of the device performance, influenced by input voltage, frequency, and bath temperature. At bath temperatures below 250 mK, the device shows a transconductance exceeding 4 mS and a current gain exceeding 45 dB. Both gain and transconductance maintain their levels up to 1 MHz, but decrease at higher frequencies, with a -3 dB cutoff around 10 MHz, and an average power dissipation of approximately 5 nW. Our simulations reveal a fully voltage-controlled, three-terminal superconducting amplifier characterized by high transconductance and gain, achieved through thermally mediated signal transduction. This architectural design presents a promising avenue for cryogenic amplification with reduced power dissipation and compatibility with current superconducting electronic systems.

Title: Efficient production of sodium Bose-Einstein condensates in a hybrid trap
Authors: Yanda Geng, Shouvik Mukherjee, Swarnav Banik, Monica Gutierrez Galan, Madison J. Anderson, Hector Sosa-Martinez, Stephen P. Eckel, Ian B. Spielman, Gretchen K. Campbell
Abstract: We describe an apparatus that efficiently produces $^{23}$Na Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) in a hybrid trap that combines a quadrupole magnetic field with a far-detuned optical dipole trap. Using a Bayesian optimization framework, we systematically optimize all BEC production parameters in modest sized batches of highly correlated parameters. Furthermore, we introduce a Lagrange multiplier-based technique to optimize the duration of different evaporation stages constrained to have a fixed total duration; this enables the progressive creation of increasingly rapid experimental sequences that still generate high quality BECs. Taken together, our techniques constitute a general approach for refining and accelerating sequence-based experimental protocols.

Title: Interpretable machine learned predictions of adsorption energies at the metal--oxide interface
Authors: Marius Juul Nielsen, Luuk H. E. Kempen, Julie de Neergaard Ravn, Raffaele Cheula, Mie Andersen
Abstract: The conversion of $\mathrm{CO_2}$ to value-added compounds is an important part of the effort to store and reuse atmospheric $\mathrm{CO_2}$ emissions. Here we focus on $\mathrm{CO_2}$ hydrogenation over so-called inverse catalysts: transition metal oxide clusters supported on metal surfaces. The conventional approach for computational screening of such candidate catalyst materials involves a reliance on density functional theory (DFT) to obtain accurate adsorption energies at a significant computational cost. Here we present a machine learning (ML)-accelerated workflow for obtaining adsorption energies at the metal--oxide interface. We enumerate possible binding sites at the clusters and use DFT to sample a subset of these with diverse local adsorbate environments. The data set is used to explore interpretable and black-box ML models with the aim to reveal the electronic and structural factors controlling adsorption at metal--oxide interfaces. Furthermore, the explored ML models can be used for low-cost prediction of adsorption energies on structures outside of the original training data set. The workflow presented here, along with the insights into trends in adsorption energies at metal--oxide interfaces, will be useful for identifying active sites, predicting parameters required for microkinetic modeling of reactions on complex catalyst materials, and accelerating data-driven catalyst design.

Title: Degradation and SEI Evolution in Alloy Anodes Revealed by Correlative Liquid-Cell Electrochemistry and Cryogenic Microscopy
Authors: Neil Mulcahy, Syeda Ramin Jannat, Geri Topore, Lukas Worch, James O. Douglas, Baptiste Gault, Mary P. Ryan, Michele Shelly Conroy
Abstract: Understanding solid liquid interfaces at high spatial and chemical resolution is crucial for advancing electrochemical energy storage technologies, yet this remains a persistent challenge due to the lack of characterisation techniques that can capture dynamic processes and preserve fragile interfacial chemistries. In lithium ion batteries, interfacial phenomena such as lithium alloying, solid electrolyte interphase formation, and electrode degradation play a decisive role in capacity retention and failure mechanisms but are difficult to observe in their native state due to high mobility, reactivity, and low atomic number of lithium. Here, we use a recently introduced correlative operando characterisation approach that integrates electrochemical liquid cell transmission electron microscopy with cryogenic atom probe tomography to resolve the evolution of a platinum alloy anode at the solid liquid interface during electrochemical cycling. This correlative, cryo enabled workflow reveals spatially heterogeneous SEI formation, the presence of lithium carbonate rich inner SEI layers, and the retention of elemental lithium within the platinum electrode, most likely trapped along grain boundaries. Additionally, we observe the formation of mossy lithium structures and irreversible lithium loss through dead lithium accumulation. Our results provide direct mechanistic insight into lithium alloying and degradation pathways in alloy based anodes and establish a generalised platform for probing dynamic electrochemical interfaces with complementary structural and chemical sensitivity. The methodology is broadly applicable to next generation electrode materials and electrochemical devices where interfacial dynamics dictate performance and stability.

Title: Superconducting Acoustogalvanic Effect in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Tsugumi Matsumoto, Ryotaro Sano, Youichi Yanase, Akito Daido
Abstract: The recently discovered twisted bilayer superconductors have suffered from a lack of reliable methods for identifying their nontrivial pairing symmetries and quantum geometry. In this study, we propose nonlinear responses driven by surface acoustic waves as a novel probe to access exotic Bogoliubov quasiparticles in such superconductors. Our approach is particularly suitable for addressing the superconducting gap structure as the gap energies in these systems typically lie within the frequency range of surface acoustic waves, and thus paves the way toward the experimental identification of exotic superconducting states especially in low-$T_c$ superconductors.

Title: Tuning Ultra-Narrow Direct Bandgap in alpha-Sn Nanocrystals: A CMOS-Compatible Approach for THz Applications

Abstract: alpha-Sn has recently been attracting significant interest due to its unique electronic properties. However, this allotrope of Sn is stable only below 13 °C and alternative options to the conventional stabilization by epitaxial growth on InSb are still a challenge. In this work, nanoparticles with inner alpha-Sn nanocrystals were synthesized on a Silicon substrate via a CMOS-compatible process through microwave irradiation. The nanoparticle morphology was characterized by Scanning Electron Microscopy and Atomic Force Microscopy, demonstrating the ability to control the nanoparticle size by a dewetting process combined with a coalescence process induced by the microwaves. Grazing Incidence X-Ray Diffraction analyses confirmed the stabilization of the alpha-Sn phase within a SnO2 shell, while X-Ray Photoemission Spectroscopy measurements revealed the presence of a bandgap. Infrared transmission spectroscopy combined with a Tauc-plot extrapolation led to an estimate of the gap in the range from 64 to 137 meV range. Furthermore, the possibility to tune the bandgap by controlling the nanoparticle size, possibly leveraging weak quantum confinement effects, was demonstrated, unveiling the potential of alpha-Sn nanoparticles on Si for the development of CMOS-compatible THz devices.

Title: Full stochastic dynamics of a tracer in a dense single-file system
Authors: Alexis Poncet, Aurélien Grabsch, Olivier Bénichou
Abstract: Tracer diffusion in single-file systems, where particles are restricted to move on a line without passing each other, has been a fertile ground to investigate anomalous diffusion and strong memory effects. While the long-time behavior of such a tracer has been well studied, with a known subdiffusive dynamics and a Gaussian description for the rescaled position, the finer details of multi-time correlations remain poorly understood. This work focuses on the limit where almost all sites of a Symmetric Exclusion Process (SEP), a paradigmatic lattice model, are occupied. It extends beyond Gaussian descriptions and single-time statistics to address the multi-time correlation functions of the tracer in the SEP. In this dense limit, we present a general relation between all $n$-time correlations of the non-Markovian tracer position process and the conditional probabilities of a single Markovian random walker. Using this relation, we derive explicit expressions for the four-time correlations and further explore important extensions: multiple tracers, non-equilibrium situations, and finite observation times. Our results underscore significant memory effects, strong temporal correlations, and the influence of initial conditions on long-time dynamics.

Title: Pair binding and Hund's rule breaking in high-symmetry fullerenes
Authors: R. Rausch, C. Karrasch
Abstract: Highly-symmetric molecules often exhibit degenerate tight-binding states at the Fermi edge. This typically results in a magnetic ground state if small interactions are introduced in accordance with Hund's rule. In some cases, Hund's rule may be broken, which signals pair binding and goes hand-in-hand with an attractive pair-binding energy. We investigate pair binding and Hund's rule breaking for the Hubbard model on high-symmetry fullerenes C$_{20}$, C$_{28}$, C$_{40}$, and C$_{60}$ by using massive, large-scale density-matrix renormalization group calculations. We exploit the SU(2) spin symmetry, the U(1) charge symmetry, and optionally the Z(N) spatial rotation symmetry of the problem. For C$_{20}$, our results agree well with available exact-diagonalization data, but our approach is numerically much cheaper. We find a Mott transition at $U_c\sim2.2t$, which is much smaller than the previously reported value of $U_c\sim4.1t$ that was extrapolated from a few datapoints. We compute the pair-binding energy for arbitrary values of $U$ and observe that it remains overall repulsive. For larger fullerenes, we are not able to evaluate the pair binding energy with sufficient precision, but we can still investigate Hund's rule breaking. For C$_{28}$, we find that Hund's rule is fulfilled with a magnetic spin-2 ground state that transitions to a spin-1 state at $U_{c,1}\sim5.4t$ before the eventual Mott transition to a spin singlet takes place at $U_{c,2}\sim 11.6t$. For C$_{40}$, Hund's rule is broken in the singlet ground state, but is restored if the system is doped with one electron. Hund's rule is also broken for C$_{60}$, and the doping with two or three electrons results in a minimum-spin state. Our results support an electronic mechanism of superconductivity for C$_{60}$ lattices. We speculate that the high geometric frustration of small fullerenes is detrimental to pair binding.

Title: Chiral Anomaly Induced Transverse Planar Transport Phenomena in Three Dimensional Spin-Orbit Coupled Metals
Authors: Rishi G. Gopalakrishnan, Binayyak B. Roy, Gargee Sharma, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: We investigate linear and nonlinear transverse planar transport phenomena (viz. linear and nonlinear Hall and Nernst coefficients) induced by chiral anomaly in three-dimensional spin-orbit coupled metallic systems. Unlike Weyl semimetals, these systems do not possess multiple Weyl nodes located at isolated points in the momentum space but instead host a pair of Fermi surfaces characterized by opposite Berry curvature fluxes enclosing the same band-degeneracy point. Using semiclassical Boltzmann transport formalism within the relaxation time approximation, we derive first- and second-order transverse planar transport coefficients induced by electrical and thermal gradients in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field. Our analysis reveals distinctive angular dependencies of the transport coefficients, along with characteristic scaling behavior with the magnetic field strength. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the anomaly-induced transport coefficients exhibit an exponential temperature dependence. This unconventional behavior leads to the violations of the Mott relation at comparatively low temperatures, highlighting unique thermoelectric signatures that can be probed experimentally in 3D spin-orbit coupled metallic systems.

Title: Tunable intertwining via collective excitations
Authors: Andras Szabo, R. Chitra
Abstract: The intertwining of multiple order parameters is a widespread phenomenon in equilibrium condensed matter systems, yet its exploration is often hindered by the complexity of real materials. Here, we present a controlled study of intertwined orders in a minimal driven-dissipative quantum-engineered platform. We consider a Bose-Einstein condensate at the intersection of two optical cavities, realizing two competing copies of a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry-breaking superradiant phase transition characterized by density wave orders. We show that collective excitations emerging at the order-to-order transition can be harnessed via periodic driving to stabilize a variety of dynamical phases, including intertwined orders. Our drive exploits dynamical symmetry reduction to generate a tunable mass gap in the excitation spectrum, offering a versatile mechanism for engineering intertwined dynamical orders in quantum-optical platforms.

Title: Thermalization in open many-body systems and KMS detailed balance
Authors: Matteo Scandi, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: Starting from a microscopic description of weak system-bath interactions, we derive from first principles a quantum master equation that does not rely on the well-known rotating wave approximation. This includes generic many-body systems, with Hamiltonians with vanishingly small energy spacings that forbid that approximation. The equation satisfies a general form of detailed balance, called KMS, which ensures exact convergence to the many-body Gibbs state. Unlike the more common notion of GNS detailed balance, this notion is compatible with the absence of the rotating wave approximation. We show that the resulting Lindbladian dynamics not only reproduces the thermal equilibrium point, but also approximates the true system evolution with an error that grows at most linearly in time, giving an exponential improvement upon previous estimates. This master equation has quasi-local jump operators, can be efficiently simulated on a quantum computer, and reduces to the usual Davies dynamics in the limit. With it, we provide a rigorous model of many-body thermalization relevant to both open quantum systems and quantum algorithms.

Title: Cryogenic Microwave Whispering Gallery Mode Spectroscopy of Paramagnetic Impurities in High-Purity Crystalline LiF
Authors: Steven Samuels, William Campbell, Michael E. Tobar, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: A low-noise cryogenic microwave spectroscopy experiment was performed on a high-purity lithium fluoride (LiF) crystal. The spectroscopy data revealed avoided level crossing interactions in whispering gallery modes, indicative of electron spin resonance (ESR) coupling with paramagnetic impurities. Analysis of the interaction spectra identified distinct spin systems corresponding to ${S = 3/2, I = 7/2}$, ${S = 1, I = 7/2}$, and ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$. The number of hyperfine splittings observed, together with the natural abundance of ions possessing the appropriate nuclear spin values, suggest that V$^{2+}$ and V$^{3+}$ impurities, exhibiting orthorhombic distortion, are the most likely sources of the narrow interaction features. This interpretation is supported by earlier ESR studies and established manufacturing records for LiF crystal growth. Additionally, a separate set of broader interaction points is consistent with an orthorhombic model involving a ${S = 3/2, I = 0}$ spin system, although the specific impurity responsible for this interaction remains unidentified.

Title: Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?

Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.

Title: A Python workflow definition for computational materials design
Authors: Jan Janssen, Janine George, Julian Geiger, Marnik Bercx, Xing Wang, Christina Ertural, Joerg Schaarschmidt, Alex M. Ganose, Giovanni Pizzi, Tilmann Hickel, Joerg Neugebauer
Abstract: Numerous Workflow Management Systems (WfMS) have been developed in the field of computational materials science with different workflow formats, hindering interoperability and reproducibility of workflows in the field. To address this challenge, we introduce here the Python Workflow Definition (PWD) as a workflow exchange format to share workflows between Python-based WfMS, currently AiiDA, jobflow, and pyiron. This development is motivated by the similarity of these three Python-based WfMS, that represent the different workflow steps and data transferred between them as nodes and edges in a graph. With the PWD, we aim at fostering the interoperability and reproducibility between the different WfMS in the context of Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (FAIR) workflows. To separate the scientific from the technical complexity, the PWD consists of three components: (1) a conda environment that specifies the software dependencies, (2) a Python module that contains the Python functions represented as nodes in the workflow graph, and (3) a workflow graph stored in the JavaScript Object Notation (JSON). The first version of the PWD supports directed acyclic graph (DAG)-based workflows. Thus, any DAG-based workflow defined in one of the three WfMS can be exported to the PWD and afterwards imported from the PWD to one of the other WfMS. After the import, the input parameters of the workflow can be adjusted and computing resources can be assigned to the workflow, before it is executed with the selected WfMS. This import from and export to the PWD is enabled by the PWD Python library that implements the PWD in AiiDA, jobflow, and pyiron.

Title: Observation of hadron scattering in a lattice gauge theory on a quantum computer
Authors: Julian Schuhmacher, Guo-Xian Su, Jesse J. Osborne, Anthony Gandon, Jad C. Halimeh, Ivano Tavernelli
Abstract: Scattering experiments are at the heart of high-energy physics (HEP), breaking matter down to its fundamental constituents, probing its formation, and providing deep insight into the inner workings of nature. In the current huge drive to forge quantum computers into complementary venues that are ideally suited to capture snapshots of far-from-equilibrium HEP dynamics, a major goal is to utilize these devices for scattering experiments. A major obstacle in this endeavor has been the hardware overhead required to access the late-time post-collision dynamics while implementing the underlying gauge symmetry. Here, we report on the first quantum simulation of scattering in a lattice gauge theory (LGT), performed on \texttt{IBM}'s \texttt{ibm\_marrakesh} quantum computer. Specifically, we quantum-simulate the collision dynamics of electrons and positrons as well as mesons in a $\mathrm{U}(1)$ LGT representing $1+1$D quantum electrodynamics (QED), uncovering rich post-collision dynamics that we can precisely tune with a topological $\Theta$-term and the fermionic mass. By monitoring the time evolution of the scattering processes, we are able to distinguish between two main regimes in the wake of the collision. The first is characterized by the delocalization of particles when the topological $\Theta$-term is weak, while the second regime shows localized particles with a clear signature when the $\Theta$-term is nontrivial. Furthermore, we show that by quenching to a small mass at the collision point, inelastic scattering occurs with a large production of matter reminiscent of quantum many-body scarring. Our work provides a major step forward in the utility of quantum computers for investigating the real-time quantum dynamics of HEP collisions.

Title: Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics
Authors: Guido Pagano, Wojciech Adamczyk, Visal So
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.

Title: Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with Improved Chiral Symmetry
Authors: Hersh Singh
Abstract: We construct a family of Ginsparg-Wilson Hamiltonians with improved chiral properties, starting from a construction of Creutz-Horvath-Neuberger that provides a doubler-free Hamiltonian lattice regularization for Dirac fermions in even spacetime dimensions. We use a higher-order generalization of the Ginsparg-Wilson relation due to Fujikawa, which yields an order-$k$ Hamiltonian overlap operator for each integer $k \geq 0$, with an exactly conserved but nonquantized chiral charge that becomes quantized as $k \to \infty$. Our construction provides physical insight into how Fujikawa's higher-order Ginsparg-Wilson relation improves chiral symmetry while reproducing the anomaly, highlighting the trade-offs inherent in any Hamiltonian lattice realization of an anomalous chiral symmetry. This class of Hamiltonian lattice regularizations, with their tunable chiral symmetry properties, offers potential advantages for quantum and tensor-network simulations.

Title: Constraints on the symmetric mass generation paradigm for lattice chiral gauge theories
Authors: Maarten Golterman, Yigal Shamir
Abstract: Within the symmetric mass generation (SMG) approach to the construction of lattice chiral gauge theories, one attempts to use interactions to render mirror fermions massive without symmetry breaking, thus obtaining the desired chiral massless spectrum. If successful, the gauge field can be turned on, and thus a chiral gauge theory can be constructed in the phase in which SMG takes place. In this paper we argue that the zeros that often replace the mirror poles of fermion two-point functions in an SMG phase are ``kinematical'' singularities, which can be avoided by choosing an appropriate set of interpolating fields that contains both elementary and composite fields. This allows us to apply general constraints on the existence of a chiral fermion spectrum which are valid in the presence of (non-gauge) interactions of arbitrary strength, including in any SMG phase. Using a suitably constructed one-particle lattice hamiltonian describing the fermion spectrum, we discuss the conditions for the applicability of the Nielsen-Ninomiya theorem to this hamiltonian. If these conditions are satisfied, the massless fermion spectrum must be vector-like. We add some general observations on the strong coupling limit of SMG models. Finally, we elaborate on the qualitative differences between four-dimensional and two-dimensional theories that limit the lessons that can be drawn from two-dimensional models.

Title: Holographic Timelike c-function
Authors: Dimitrios Giataganas
Abstract: The integration of high-energy degrees of freedom along the renormalization group (RG) flow in Poincaré-invariant theories can be captured by a monotonic c-function. For such theories, holographic monotonic c-functions have been constructed using entanglement entropy. However, in theories with broken Lorentz invariance, such constructions generally fail, reflecting both the violation of the entanglement RG monotonicity and its limitations in capturing certain properties of non-relativistic RG flows. Since many quantum many-body systems lack Lorentz invariance, it is of significant importance to identify a quantity that reflects the decrease in degrees of freedom along non-relativistic RG flows. We show that the recently introduced holographic timelike entanglement entropy naturally gives rise to a new c-function applicable to all such theories. We further demonstrate the existence of this c-function in theories with Lifshitz and hyperscaling-violating fixed points, showing that, provided the null energy conditions and thermodynamic stability are satisfied, the proposed c-function exhibits the expected monotonic behavior along the RG flow.

Title: Defects and acceptor removal in 60Co γ-irradiated p-type silicon

Abstract: Boron-doped silicon detectors used in high radiation environments like the future HL-LHC show a degradation in device performance due to the radiation induced deactivation of the active boron dopant. This effect, known as the so-called Acceptor Removal Effect (ARE), depends on particle type, particle energy and radiation dose and is usually explained by the formation of boroninterstitial - oxygen-interstitial (BiOi) defects that induce a donor-type defect level in the upper part of the Si band gap. Here we present defect characterization studies using Thermally Stimulated Current technique (TSC) and Deep Level Transient Spectroscopy (DLTS) on a set of epitaxially grown p-type silicon diodes of different resistivity, irradiated with 60Co {\gamma}-rays. We used the defect parameters (activation energy, charge carrier capture cross sections and defect concentration) obtained from DLTS experiments for modeling the corresponding TSC spectra, and subsequently compared those with the experimental TSC results. This approach shows that the di-vacancy which is well characterized by DLTS correlates with the so-far unspecified charge emission signal of the X-defect that partially overlaps with the BiOi peak in TSC spectra. Additionally, in order to evaluate the impact of BiOi defect formation on the macroscopic properties of the device, we compared the BiOi defect concentration with the change in the effective carrier concentration Neff obtained from C-V measurements. It shows that the variations in Neff are about twice the changes in the BiOi concentration, which is in perfect consistency with the assumption of boron deactivation by the formation of the BiOi donor in irradiated p-type Si.

Title: Hybrid Machine Learning and Mathematical Modeling for Tumor Dynamics Prediction: Comparing SPIONs against mNP-FDG
Authors: Amit K Chattopadhyay, Aimee Pascaline N Unkundiye, Gillian Pearce
Abstract: This is a Machine Learning guided study towards zone-specific ray therapy. Combining Machine Learning (Extreme Gradient Boosting) with continuum modeling (exponential and logistic growth), we find that while fluorodeoxyglucose-coated (mNP-FDG) can control cancerous tumor progression within 2 days compared to 18 days by Superparamagnetic Iron Oxide Nanoparticles (SPIONs), for complete termination of the tumor, SPIONS (20 days) are superior compared to mNP-FDG (more than 40 days). We also provide an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) developed with Tkinter/Python that allows users to input relevant data, such as treatment type and time, to receive real-time tumor volume predictions. Our ML-guided prediction indicates joint therapy as the optimum choice, with mNP-FDG ideal for taming the tumor spread, followed by SPIONs for complete eradication, facilitating personalized cancer treatment in clinical practice.

Title: Dynamical Data for More Efficient and Generalizable Learning: A Case Study in Disordered Elastic Networks
Authors: Salman N. Salman, Sergey A. Shteingolts, Ron Levie, Dan Mendels
Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.

Title: Direct Measurement of Zak Phase and Higher Winding Numbers in an Electroacoustic Cavity System
Authors: Guang-Chen He, Zhao-Xian Chen, Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Ming-Hui Lu
Abstract: Topological phases are states of matter defined by global topological invariants that remain invariant under adiabatic parameter variations, provided no topological phase transition occurs. This endows them with intrinsic robustness against local perturbations. Experimentally, these phases are often identified indirectly by observing robust boundary states, protected by the bulk-boundary correspondence. Here, we propose an experimental method for the direct measurement of topological invariants via adiabatic state evolution in electroacoustic coupled resonators, where time-dependent cavity modes effectively emulate the bulk wavefunction of a periodic system. Under varying external driving fields, specially prepared initial states evolve along distinct parameter-space paths. By tracking the relative phase differences among states along these trajectories, we successfully observe the quantized Zak phase in both the conventional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model and its extension incorporating with next-nearest-neighbor coupling. This approach provides compelling experimental evidence for the precise identification of topological invariants and can be extended to more complex topological systems.

Title: Effect of Vaccine Dose Intervals: Considering Immunity Levels, Vaccine Efficacy, and Strain Variants for Disease Control Strategy
Authors: Samiran Ghosh, Malay Banerjee, Amit K Chattopadhyay
Abstract: In this study, we present an immuno-epidemic model to understand mitigation options during an epidemic break. The model incorporates comorbidity and multiple-vaccine doses through a system of coupled integro-differential equations to analyze the epidemic rate and intensity from a knowledge of the basic reproduction number and time-distributed rate functions. Our modeling results show that the interval between vaccine doses is a key control parameter that can be tuned to significantly influence disease spread. We show that multiple doses induce a hysteresis effect in immunity levels that offers a better mitigation alternative compared to frequent vaccination which is less cost-effective while being more intrusive. Optimal dosing intervals, emphasizing the cost-effectiveness of each vaccination effort, and determined by various factors such as the level of immunity and efficacy of vaccines against different strains, appear to be crucial in disease management. The model is sufficiently generic that can be extended to accommodate specific disease forms.

Title: Identifying Heart Attack Risk in Vulnerable Population: A Machine Learning Approach
Authors: Subhagata Chattopadhyay, Amit K Chattopadhyay
Abstract: The COVID-19 pandemic has significantly increased the incidence of post-infection cardiovascular events, particularly myocardial infarction, in individuals over 40. While the underlying mechanisms remain elusive, this study employs a hybrid machine learning approach to analyze epidemiological data in assessing 13 key heart attack risk factors and their susceptibility. Based on a unique dataset that combines demographic, biochemical, ECG, and thallium stress-tests, this study categorizes distinct subpopulations against varying risk profiles and then divides the population into 'at-risk' (AR) and 'not-at-risk' (NAR) groups using clustering algorithms. The study reveals strong association between the likelihood of experiencing a heart attack on the 13 risk factors studied. The aggravated risk for postmenopausal patients indicates compromised individual risk factors due to estrogen depletion that may be, further compromised by extraneous stress impacts, like anxiety and fear, aspects that have traditionally eluded data modeling predictions.

Title: Magnon blockade in spin-magnon systems with frequency detuning
Authors: Sheng Zhao, Ya-Long Ren, Xin-Lei Hei, Xue-Feng Pan, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: Magnon blockade is a physical mechanism for the preparation of a single-magnon source, which has important applications in quantum information processing. Here we propose a scheme for generating an optimal magnon blockade in the spin-magnon quantum system. By introducing frequency detuning between the magnon and the spin qubit of the NV center, the conventional magnon blockade and the unconventional magnon blockade can be obtained under both strong and weak coupling, relaxing the requirements for coupling strength. Moreover, the conventional and unconventional magnon blockade can occur simultaneously when both the magnon and the spin qubit are driven. This allows the equal-time second-order correlation function to reach $10^{-8}$, about five orders of magnitude lower than that in previous works. Additionally, the time-delayed second-order correlation function avoids oscillation. Our study demonstrates the impact of frequency detuning on the magnon blockade and proposes methods to enhance the magnon blockade and relax the requirements for coupling strength through frequency detuning.

Title: Breaking co-existence: zealotry vs. nonlinear social impact
Authors: Christopher R. Kitching, Lucía S. Ramirez, Maxi San Miguel, Tobias Galla
Abstract: We study how zealotry and nonlinear social impact affect consensus formation in the nonlinear voter model, evolutionary games, and the partisan voter model. In all three models, consensus is an absorbing state in finite populations, while co-existence is a possible outcome of the deterministic dynamics. We show that sufficiently strong zealotry -- i.e., the presence of agents who never change state -- can drive infinite populations to consensus in all three models. However, while evolutionary games and the partisan voter model permit zealotry-induced consensus for all values of their model parameters, the nonlinear voter model does not. Central to this difference is the shape of the social impact function, which quantifies how the influence of a group scales with size, and is therefore a measure of majority and minority effects. We derive general conditions relating the slope of this function at small group sizes to the local stability of consensus. Sublinear impact favours minorities and can override zealotry to prevent consensus, whereas superlinear impact promotes majorities and therefore facilitates consensus. We extend the analysis to finite populations, exploring the time-to-consensus, and the shape of quasi-stationary distributions.

Title: Probing the quantum motion of a macroscopic mechanical oscillator with a radio-frequency superconducting qubit
Authors: Kyrylo Gerashchenko, Remi Rousseau, Léo Balembois, Himanshu Patange, Paul Manset, W. Clarke Smith, Zaki Leghtas, Emmanuel Flurin, Thibaut Jacqmin, Samuel Deléglise
Abstract: Long-lived mechanical resonators like drums oscillating at MHz frequencies and operating in the quantum regime offer a powerful platform for quantum technologies and tests of fundamental physics. Yet, quantum control of such systems remains challenging, particularly owing to their low energy scale and the difficulty of achieving efficient coupling to other well-controlled quantum devices. Here, we demonstrate repeated, and high-fidelity interactions between a 4 MHz suspended silicon nitride membrane and a resonant superconducting heavy-fluxonium qubit. The qubit is initialized at an effective temperature of 27~$\mathrm{\mu}$K and read out in a single-shot with 77% fidelity. During the membrane's 6~ms lifetime, the two systems swap excitations more than 300 times. After each interaction, a state-selective detection is performed, implementing a stroboscopic series of weak measurements that provide information about the mechanical state. The accumulated records reconstruct the membrane's position noise-spectrum, revealing both its thermal occupation $n_\mathrm{th}\approx47$ at 10~mK and the qubit-induced back-action. By preparing the qubit either in its ground or excited state before each interaction, we observe an imbalance between the emission and absorption spectra, proportional to $n_\mathrm{th}$ and $n_\mathrm{th}+1$, respectively-a hallmark of the non-commutation of phonon creation and annihilation operators. Since the predicted Diósi-Penrose gravitational collapse time is comparable to the measured mechanical decoherence time, our architecture enters a regime where gravity-induced decoherence could be tested directly.

Title: X-ray Absorption Linear Dichroism at the Ti K-edge of TiO2 anatase single crystals
Authors: T.C. Rossi, D. Grolimund, M. Nachtegaal, O. Cannelli, G.F. Mancini, C. Bacellar, D. Kinschel, J.R. Rouxel, N. Ohannessian, D. Pergolesi, T. Lippert, M. Chergui
Abstract: Anatase TiO2 (a-TiO2) exhibits a strong X-ray absorption linear dichroism with the X-ray incidence angle in the pre-edge, the XANES and the EXAFS at the titanium K-edge. In the pre-edge region the behaviour of the A1-A3 and B peaks, originating from the 1s-3d transitions, is due to the strong $p$-orbital polarization and strong $p-d$ orbital mixing. An unambiguous assignment of the pre-edge peak transitions is made in the monoelectronic approximation with the support of ab initio finite difference method calculations and spherical tensor analysis in quantitative agreement with the experiment. It is found that A1 is mostly an on-site 3d-4p hybridized transition, while peaks A3 and B are non-local transitions, with A3 being mostly dipolar and influence by the 3d-4p intersite hybridization, while B is due to interactions at longer range. Finally, peak A2 which was previously assigned to a transition involving pentacoordinated titanium atoms exhibits a quadrupolar angular evolution with incidence angle. These results pave the way to the use of the pre-edge peaks at the K-edge of a-TiO2 to characterize the electronic structure of related materials and in the field of ultrafast XAS where the linear dichroism can be used to compare the photophysics along different axes.

Title: Multi-vortex Bose-Einstein condensate: examining the role of interaction range using Gaussian potential
Authors: Md Hamid, M A H Ahsan
Abstract: We present exact diagonalization study on a system of $10 \leq N \leq 24$ spinless bosons interacting via repulsive Gaussian potential, harmonically confined in $xy$-plane with an externally impressed rotation about the $z$-axis. The two-body interaction strength in the Gaussian potential is taken in the strongly interacting regime with values of interaction range in the regime $0\leq \sigma \leq 1$. The diagonalization of the $N$-body Hamiltonian matrix, in subspaces of total angular momentum in the regime $0\le L_{z} \le 4N$ corresponds to the filling fraction $\nu\lesssim 3.2$ is carried out to obtain the variationally exact ground-state wavefunction and the corresponding eigenvalue. It is found that an increase in interaction range $\sigma$ leads to (a) a systematic decrease in energy, (b) an increase in the critical angular velocity $\Omega_{c_{i}}$ of the $i${th} vortex state and (c) an increase in the largest eigenvalue $\lambda_{1}$, (condensate fraction), of one-particle reduced density matrix (OPRDM). The von Neumann entropy $S_{1}\left(L_{z},\sigma\right)$, quantifying the quantum entanglement between the particles in the many-body ground state, is largely found to decrease with increase in $\sigma$. Crossings in von Neumann entropy for several of the angular momentum states are observed with variation in $\sigma$. The response of the Bose-Einstein condensate to rotation is examined through $L_{z}\left(\sigma\right)-\Omega\left(\sigma\right)$ stability graph for several values of $\sigma$. A vortex state with larger plateau length on the $L_{z}-\Omega$ graph is considered to be more stable. The internal structure of the condensate, as depicted by the conditional probability distribution (CPD) in the body-fixed frame, exhibits characteristic features with interaction range $\sigma$. One such feature is the merging of the cores of the two-vortex state.

Title: Discontinuous shear thickening of a moderately dense inertial suspension of hydrodynamically interacting frictionless soft particles
Authors: Satoshi Takada, Kazuhiro Hara, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: We demonstrate that discontinuous shear thickening (DST) can occur even in moderately dense, inertial suspensions of hydrodynamically interacting, frictionless soft particles. Using the Lubrication-Friction Discrete Element Method, our simulations reveal that DST can emerge at lower particle densities, provided that both the inertia of the suspended particles and their softness are sufficiently pronounced. Furthermore, we show that, under these conditions, the DST behavior obtained from the simulation qualitatively agrees with that predicted by kinetic theory, even without accounting for hydrodynamic interactions. These findings expand the understanding of DST in soft particle systems and highlight the importance of particle inertia and softness in controlling rheological behavior.

Title: The grammar of the Ising model: A new complexity hierarchy
Authors: Tobias Reinhart, Gemma De les Coves
Abstract: How complex is an Ising model? Usually, this is measured by the computational complexity of its ground state energy problem. Yet, this complexity measure only distinguishes between planar and non-planar interaction graphs, and thus fails to capture properties such as the average node degree, the number of long range interactions, or the dimensionality of the lattice. Herein, we introduce a new complexity measure for Ising models and thoroughly classify Ising models with respect to it. Specifically, given an Ising model we consider the decision problem corresponding to the function graph of its Hamiltonian, and classify this problem in the Chomsky hierarchy. We prove that the language of this decision problem is (i) regular if and only if the Ising model is finite, (ii) constructive context free if and only if the Ising model is linear and its edge language is regular, (iii) constructive context sensitive if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is context sensitive, and (iv) decidable if and only if the edge language of the Ising model is decidable. We apply this theorem to show that the 1d Ising model, the Ising model on generalised ladder graphs, and the Ising model on layerwise complete graphs are constructive context free, while the 2d Ising model, the all-to-all Ising model, and the Ising model on perfect binary trees are constructive context sensitive. This work is a first step in the characterisation of physical interactions in terms of grammars.

Title: Correlated Terahertz phonon-ion interactions control ion conduction in a solid electrolyte

Abstract: Ionic conduction in solids that exceeds 1 mS/cm is predicted to involve collective phonon-ion interactions in the crystal lattice. Here, we use theory and experiment to measure the possible contribution of collective phonon-ion modes to Li+ migration in Li0.5La0.5TiO3 (LLTO). The ab initio calculations predict that the targeted excitation of individual TiO6 rocking modes can lead to a three order of magnitude increase in the Li+ jump rate as compared to the excitation of single vibrational modes in the lattice associated with heating. Experimentally, coherently driving the TiO6 rocking via terahertz (THz) illumination leads to a ten-fold decrease in the normalized impedance compared to the excitation of acoustic and optical phonons that are associated with heating. These findings provide new insights into phonon-coupled ion migration mechanisms and material design rules for ion conductors and opto-ionic materials.

Title: Mpemba effect on non-equilibrium active Markov chains
Authors: Apurba Biswas, Arnab Pal
Abstract: We study the Mpemba effect on a non-equilibrium Markov chain that mimics the run and tumble motion of an active particle in a discrete energy landscape. The broken detailed balance, rendered by the activity, gives rise to a unique anomalous relaxation in the system which is distinctly different than the typical equilibrium systems. We observe that the activity can both suppress or induce the Mpemba effect. Furthermore, we report an oscillatory Mpemba effect where the relaxation trajectories, emanating from the hot and cold initial conditions, cross each other multiple times and this occurs due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in the relaxation spectrum due to the activity. Our work reveals a possible pathway for studying the Mpemba effect in active living systems where broken detailed balance is crucial to achieve many biological functions.

Title: Electronic structure of molybdenene from first principles
Authors: Ashkan Shekaari, Mahmoud Jafari
Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate the electronic structure and lattice stability of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic phases, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase is metallic. Analyzing partial density of states has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty as well as being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies for either phase, showing lattice instability, as reported in the experimental literature.

Title: Cluster state as a non-invertible symmetry protected topological phase
Authors: Sahand Seifnashri, Shu-Heng Shao
Abstract: We show that the standard 1+1d $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ cluster model has a non-invertible global symmetry, described by the fusion category Rep(D$_8$). Therefore, the cluster state is not only a $\mathbb{Z}_2\times \mathbb{Z}_2$ symmetry protected topological (SPT) phase, but also a non-invertible SPT phase. We further find two new commuting Pauli Hamiltonians for the other two Rep(D$_8$) SPT phases on a tensor product Hilbert space of qubits, matching the classification in field theory and mathematics. We identify the edge modes and the local projective algebras at the interfaces between these non-invertible SPT phases. Finally, we show that there does not exist a symmetric entangler that maps between these distinct SPT states.

Title: Orbits, spirals, and trapped states: Dynamics of a phoretic Janus particle in a radial concentration gradient
Authors: Parvin Bayati, Stewart A. Mallory
Abstract: A longstanding goal in colloidal active matter is to understand how gradients in fuel concentration influence the motion of phoretic Janus particles. Here, we present a theoretical description of the motion of a spherical phoretic Janus particle in the presence of a radial gradient of the chemical solute driving self-propulsion. Radial gradients are a geometry relevant to many scenarios in active matter systems and naturally arise due to the presence of a point source or sink of fuel. We derive an analytical solution for the Janus particle's velocity and quantify the influence of the radial concentration gradient on the particle's trajectory. Compared to a phoretic Janus particle in a linear gradient in fuel concentration, we uncover a much richer set of dynamical behaviors, including circular orbits and trapped stationary states. We identify the ratio of the phoretic mobilities between the two domains of the Janus particle as a central quantity in tuning their dynamics. Our results provide a path for developing novel protocols for tuning the dynamics of phoretic Janus particles and mixing fluid at the microscale. In addition, this work suggests a method for quantifying the surface properties of phoretic Janus particles, which have proven challenging to probe experimentally.

Title: Generic multicomponent mixtures are multistable
Authors: Yicheng Qiang, Chengjie Luo, David Zwicker
Abstract: Liquid mixtures of many interacting components often exhibit numerous coexisting types of droplets. An exciting example is the cytosol of biological cells, where diverse droplets, called condensates, are essential for cellular function. However, how much their formation is constrained by thermodynamics is currently unclear. Linear stability analysis predicts that homogeneous mixtures become more robust to fluctuations as the number of components increases, suggesting that droplets do not form easily in multicomponent mixtures. In contrast, we show through numerical simulations and analytical scaling laws that the number of coexisting phases typically increases with the number of components in equilibrium. The combination of both results suggests that generic multicomponent mixtures can maintain many metastable states with various droplets, generalizing the nucleation-and-growth regime of binary mixtures. Our theory also indicates why cells exhibit much fewer condensates than components and how they could exploit multistability to independently form various condensates.

Title: Metabolic coordination and phase transitions in spatially distributed multi-cellular systems
Authors: Krishnadev Narayanankutty, José Antonio Pereiro-Morejon, Arián Ferrero-Fernández, Valentina Onesto, Stefania Forciniti, Loretta L. del Mercato, Roberto Mulet, Andrea De Martino, David S. Tourigny, Daniele De Martino
Abstract: During overflow metabolism, cells excrete glycolytic byproducts when growing under aerobic conditions in a seemingly wasteful fashion. While potentially advantageous for microbes with finite oxidative capacity, its role in higher organisms is harder to assess. Recent single-cell experiments suggest overflow metabolism arises due to imbalances in inter-cellular exchange networks. We quantitatively characterize this scenario by integrating spatial metabolic modeling with tools from statistical physics and experimental single-cell flux data. Our results provide a theoretical demonstration of how diffusion-limited exchanges shape the space of accessible multi-cellular metabolic states. Specifically, a phase transition from a balanced network of exchanges to an unbalanced, overflow regime occurs as mean glucose and oxygen uptake rates vary. Heterogeneous single-cell metabolic phenotypes occur near this transition. Time-resolved tumor-stroma co-culture data support the idea that overflow metabolism stems from failure of inter-cellular metabolic coordination. In summary, environmental control is an emergent multi-cellular property, rather than a cell-autonomous effect.

Title: Drastic modification in thermal conductivity of TiCoSb Half-Heusler alloy: Phonon engineering by lattice softening and ionic polarization
Authors: Suman Mahakal, Avijit Jana, Diptasikha Das, Nabakumar Rana, Pallabi Sardar, Shamima Hussain, Santanu K. Maiti, Kartick Malik
Abstract: A drastic variation (~47%) in thermal conductivity (\k{appa}) for synthesized samples (TiCoSb1+x, x=0.0, 0.01, 0.02, 0.03, 0.04, and 0.06) is observed. The lowest \k{appa} is reported for the TiCoSb1.02 sample. Thermal variation of \k{appa} is estimated from the temperature and power-dependent Raman spectroscopy data. Embedded phases and Co vacancy are analysed, employing scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy data. X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy reveals the Co vacancy in synthesized samples, and the most ordered phase is TiCoSb1.02 amid the synthesized samples. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy measurement of the synthesized samples provides direct evidence of Co vacancies and their increase with Sb concentration (x). Lattice dynamics are revealed using Raman Spectroscopy (RS) measurements. RS data accomplishes that variation in \k{appa} as a function of Sb concentration is observed owing to an alteration in phonon group velocity, related to lattice softening. The polar nature of the TiCoSb half-Heusler (HH) sample is revealed. Longitudinal Optical and Transvers Optical phonon (LO-TO) splitting in RS is observed due to the polar nature of TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Tailoring in LO-TO splitting due to the screening effect, correlated with Co vacancies, is reported for TiCoSb1+x synthesized samples. Lattice softening and LO-TO splitting lead to a minimum \k{appa} for the TiCoSb1.02 synthesized sample.

Title: Fermi-Level Pinning of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov States in a Superconductor with Weakly Broken Spin-Rotational Invariance
Authors: E. S. Andriyakhina, S. L. Khortsev, F. Evers
Abstract: As is well known, magnetic impurities adsorbed on superconductors, e.g. of the s-wave type, can introduce a bound gap-state (Yu-Shiba-Rusinov resonance). We here investigate within a minimal model how the impurity moment arranges with respect to a weak homogeneous internal magnetic field employing a fully self-consistent mean-field treatment. Our investigation reveals a critical window of impurity-to-substrate coupling constants, $J$. The width of the critical region, $\delta J$, scales like $\delta J \sim B/\Delta$, where $B$ is the magnitude of the internal field, that breaks the spin-rotation symmetry, and $\Delta$ is the bulk order parameter. While tuning $J$ through the window, the energy of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) resonance is pinned to the Fermi energy $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$ and the impurity moment rotates in a continuous fashion. We emphasize the pivotal role of self-consistency: In treatments ignoring self-consistency, the critical window adopts zero width, $\delta J=0$; consequently, there is no pinning of the YSR-resonance to $\varepsilon_{\rm F}$, the impurity orientation jumps and therefore this orientation cannot be controlled continuously by fine-tuning the coupling $J$. In this sense, our study highlights the significance of self-consistency for understanding intricate magnetic interactions between superconductive materials and Shiba chains.

Title: Magnetic geometry induced quantum geometry and nonlinear transports
Authors: Haiyuan Zhu, Jiayu Li, Xiaobing Chen, Yutong Yu, Qihang Liu
Abstract: The combination of quantum geometry and magnetic geometry in magnets excites diverse phenomena, some critical for antiferromagnetic spintronics. However, very few material platforms have been predicted and experimentally verified to date, with the material pool restricted by the assumed need for strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC). Here, we bypass the need for SOC by considering magnetic order induced quantum geometry and corresponding nonlinear transports (NLTs) in antiferromagnets (AFMs). By integrating spin space group theory into the symmetry analysis, we find that collinear and coplanar magnetic geometries can only induce NLT driven by Berry curvature dipole, and noncoplanar ones may trigger NLT driven by dipoles of Berry curvature, inverse mass, and quantum metric. Using this approach, we establish a materials database of 260 AFMs with SOC-free NLT effects, and complement this with first-principles calculations on several prototypical material candidates. Our work not only provides a universal theoretical framework for studying various magnetism-driven transport effects, but also predicts broad, experimentally accessible material platforms for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Abstract: The computational power and fault-tolerance of future large-scale quantum processors derive in large part from the connectivity between the qubits. One approach to increase connectivity is to engineer qubit-qubit interactions at a distance. Alternatively, the connectivity can be increased by physically displacing the qubits. This has been explored in trapped-ion experiments and using neutral atoms trapped with optical tweezers. For semiconductor spin qubits, several studies have investigated spin coherent shuttling of individual electrons, but high-fidelity transport over extended distances remains to be demonstrated. Here we report shuttling of an electron inside an isotopically purified Si/SiGe heterostructure using electric gate potentials. First, we form static quantum dots, and study how spin coherence decays as we repeatedly move a single electron between up to five dots. Next, we create a traveling wave potential to transport an electron in a moving quantum dot. This second method shows substantially better spin coherence than the first. It allows us to displace an electron over an effective distance of 10 $\mu$m in under 200 ns with an average fidelity of 99.5%. These results will guide future efforts to realize large-scale semiconductor quantum processors, making use of electron shuttling both within and between qubit arrays.

Title: Dissipative chaos and steady state of open Tavis-Cummings dimer
Authors: Debabrata Mondal, Andrey Kolovsky, S. Sinha
Abstract: We consider a coupled atom-photon system described by the Tavis-Cummings dimer (two coupled cavities) in the presence of photon loss and atomic pumping, to investigate the quantum signature of dissipative chaos. The appropriate classical limit of the model allows us to obtain a phase diagram identifying different dynamical phases, especially the onset of chaos. Both classically and quantum mechanically, we demonstrate the emergence of a steady state in the chaotic regime and analyze its properties. The interplay between quantum fluctuation and chaos leads to enhanced mixing dynamics and dephasing, resulting in the formation of an incoherent photonic fluid. The steady state exhibits an intriguing phenomenon of subsystem thermalization even outside the chaotic regime; however, its effective temperature increases with the degree of chaos. Moreover, the statistical properties of the steady state show a close connection with the random matrix theory. Finally, we discuss the experimental relevance of our findings, which can be tested in cavity and circuit quantum electrodynamics setups.

Title: Shift photocurrent vortices from topological polarization textures
Authors: Aneesh Agarwal, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Daniel Bennett, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: Following the recent interest in van der Waals (vdW) ferroelectrics, topologically nontrivial polar structures have been predicted to form in twisted bilayers. However, these structures have proven difficult to observe experimentally. We propose that these textures may be probed optically by showing that topological polarization textures result in exotic nonlinear optical responses. We derive this relationship analytically using non-Abelian Berry connections and a quantum-geometric framework, supported by tight-binding and first-principles calculations. For the case of moiré materials without centrosymmetry, which form networks of polar merons and antimerons, the shift photoconductivity forms a vortex-like structure in real space. For a range of frequencies where transitions between topologically trivial bands occur at the Brillouin zone edge, the shift photocurrents are antiparallel to the in-plane electronic polarization field. Our findings highlight the interplay between complex polarization textures and nonlinear optical responses in vdW materials and provide a sought-after strategy for their experimental detection.

Title: Effect of the background flow on the motility induced phase separation
Authors: Soni D. Prajapati, Akshay Bhatnagar, Anupam Gupta
Abstract: We simulate active Brownian particles (ABPs) with soft-repulsive interactions subjected to a four-roll-mill flow. In the absence of flow, this system exhibits motility-induced phase separation (MIPS). To investigate the interplay between MIPS and flow-induced mixing, we introduce dimensionless parameters: a scaled time, $\tau$, and a scaled velocity, ${\rm v}$, characterizing the ratio of ABP to fluid time and velocity scales, respectively. The parameter space defined by $\tau$ and ${\rm v}$ reveals three distinct ABP distribution regimes. At low velocities ${\rm v} \ll 1$, flow dominates, leading to a homogeneous mixture. Conversely, at high velocities ${\rm v} \gg 1$, motility prevails, resulting in MIPS. In the intermediate regime (${\rm v} \sim 1$), the system's behavior depends on $\tau$. For $\tau <1$, a moderately mixed homogeneous phase emerges, while for $\tau >1$, a novel phase, termed flow-induced phase separation (FIPS), arises due to the combined effects of flow topology and ABP motility and size. To characterize these phases, we analyze drift velocity, diffusivity, mean-squared displacement, giant number fluctuations, radial distribution function, and cluster-size distribution.

Title: Three-dimensional Abelian and non-Abelian gauge Higgs theories
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Andrea Pelissetto, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: Gauge symmetries and Higgs mechanisms are key features of theories describing high-energy particle physics and collective phenomena in statistical and condensed-matter physics. In this review we address the collective behavior of systems of multicomponent scalar fields interacting with gauge fields, which can be already present in the underlying microscopic system or emerge only at criticality. The interplay between local gauge and global symmetries determines the phase diagram, the nature of the Higgs phases, and the nature of phase transitions between the high-temperature disordered and the low-temperature Higgs phases. However, additional crucial features determine the universal properties of the critical behavior at continuous transitions. Specifically, their nature also depends on the role played by the gauge modes at criticality. Effective (Abelian or non-Abelian) gauge Higgs field theories emerge when gauge modes develop critical correlations. On the other hand, a more standard critical behavior, which admits an effective description in terms of Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson $\Phi^4$ theories, occurs when gauge-field modes are short ranged at the transition. In the latter case, gauge fields only prevent non-gauge invariant correlation functions from becoming critical. This review covers the recent progress made in the study of Higgs systems with Abelian and non-Abelian gauge fields. We discuss the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of systems with a classical partition function, focusing mainly on three-dimensional systems, and only briefly discussing two-dimensional models. However, by using the quantum-to-classical mapping, the results on the critical behavior for classical systems in $D=d+1$ dimensions can be extended to quantum transitions in $d$ dimensions.

Title: Optical Manifestations of Quantum Geometry in Electron-Phonon Coupling
Authors: Jiaming Hu, Wenbin Li, Zhichao Guo, Hua Wang, Kai Chang
Abstract: Quantum geometry is crucial for understanding intricate condensed matter systems, governing transport phenomena and optical responses. However, traditional studies predominantly consider a static crystal lattice, focusing exclusively on the pure-electronic quantum geometry of the Hilbert space parameterized by electronic wave vectors, thereby overlooking the dynamic effects arising from phonons and their coupling with electrons. In this work, we reveal the intrinsic quantum geometry of the electron-phonon coupling (EPC), which resides in the hybrid Hilbert space parameterized by both the electronic wave vectors and phonon displacements. The EPC quantum metric, EPC Berry curvature and EPC shift vector, as central elements, quantify the EPC-induced velocity, polarization, and anomalous charge-center shift, respectively. We further connect this geometry to phonon-mediated optical responses, particularly in-gap resonances, enabling experimental detection and characterization of EPC quantum geometry.

Title: Vortex lattice states of bilayer electron-hole fluids in quantizing magnetic fields
Authors: Bo Zou, Allan H. MacDonald
Abstract: We show that the ground state of a weakly charged two-dimensional electron-hole fluid in a strong magnetic field is a broken translation symmetry state with interpenetrating lattices of localized vortices and antivortices in the electron-hole-pair field. The vortices and antivortices carry fractional charges of equal sign but unequal magnitude and have a honeycomb lattice structure that contrasts with the triangular lattices of superconducting electron-electron-pair vortex lattices. We predict that increasing charge density or weakening magnetic field drives a vortex delocalization transition that would be signaled experimentally by an abrupt increase in counterflow transport resistance.

Title: Single-File Diffusion of Active Brownian Particles
Authors: A. Akintunde, P. Bayati, H. Row, S.A. Mallory
Abstract: Single-file diffusion (SFD) is a key mechanism underlying transport phenomena in confined physical and biological systems. In a typical SFD process, microscopic particles are restricted to moving in a narrow channel where they cannot pass one another, resulting in constrained motion and anomalous long-time diffusion. In this study, we use Brownian dynamics simulations and analytical theory to investigate the SFD of athermal active Brownian particles (ABPs), a minimal model of active colloids. Building on prior work (Phys. Rev. E 108, 064601 (2023)), where the kinetic temperature, pressure, and compressibility of the single-file ABP system were derived, we develop an accurate analytical expression for the mean square displacement (MSD) of a tagged particle. We find that the MSD exhibits ballistic behavior at short times, governed by the reduced kinetic temperature of the system. At long times, the characteristic subdiffusive scaling of SFD, $\langle (\Delta x)^2 \rangle \sim t^{1/2}$, is preserved. However, self-propulsion introduces significant changes to the 1D mobility, which we directly relate to the system's compressibility. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the generalized 1D mobility, originally proposed by Kollmann for equilibrium systems (Phys. Rev. Lett. 90, 180602 (2003)), can be extended to active systems with minimal modification. These findings provide a framework for understanding particle transport in active systems and for tuning transport properties at the microscale, particularly in geometries where motion is highly restricted.

Title: Laser-Induced Relaxation Oscillations in Superconducting Nanobridge Single Photon Detectors
Authors: F.B. Baalbergen, I.E. Zadeh, M.J.A. de Dood
Abstract: We demonstrate novel laser-induced relaxation oscillations in superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs). These oscillations appear when a voltage biased NbTiN nanobridge detector is illuminated with intense pulsed laser light at a repetition rate of $\sim19\text{MHz}$. They differ from the well-known relaxation oscillations by a step-wise increase in frequency and phase locking of the oscillations to the laser pulses. We create a model that incorporates electrical feedback and excludes thermal effects to simulate and explain the origin of the observed laser-induced relaxation oscillations. Qualitative agreement to the experiment is achieved using realistic values for the parameters in the model.

Title: Symmetry-forbidden intraband transitions leading to ultralow Gilbert damping in van der Waals ferromagnets
Authors: Weizhao Chen, Yu Zhang, Yi Liu, Zhe Yuan
Abstract: Based upon first-principles calculations, we report ultralow Gilbert damping in two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets. The low damping occurs at low temperature because mirror symmetry prohibits intraband transitions. The monotonic dependence on the electronic scattering rate suggests the absent lower limit, in contrast to conventional ferromagnetic materials. Breaking mirror symmetry through magnetization rotation, layer stacking, or structural phase transition significantly increases damping by enabling intraband transitions. Topological nodal lines, also protected by mirror symmetry, contribute substantially to interband-transition-mediated damping, which can be tuned by adjusting the Fermi level. Our findings elucidate the unique characteristics of Gilbert damping in 2D vdW ferromagnets, providing valuable insights for designing low-dimensional spintronic devices with high energy efficiency.

Title: Preparation and observation of anomalous counterpropagating edge states in a periodically driven optical Raman lattice
Authors: Hongting Hou, Long Zhang
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of real-space edge modes with ultracold atoms [Braun et al., Nat. Phys. 20, 1306 (2024)], we investigate the preparation and detection of anomalous counterpropagating edge states -- a defining feature of the anomalous Floquet valley-Hall (AFVH) phase -- in a two-dimensional periodically driven optical Raman lattice. Modeling the atomic cloud with a Gaussian wave packet state, we explore, both analytically and numerically, how the population of edge modes depends on the initial-state parameters. In particular, we reveal that, in addition to the internal spin state, the initial momenta parallel and perpendicular to the boundary play essential roles: they independently control the selective population of edge states across distinct momenta and within separate quasienergy gaps. Furthermore, we examine the wave-packet dynamics of counterpropagating edge states and demonstrate that their characteristic motion is robust against long-range disorder. These results establish a theoretical framework for future experimental explorations of the AFVH phase and topological phenomena associated with its unique edge modes.

Title: Theory of the photonic Joule effect in superconducting circuits
Authors: Samuel Cailleaux, Quentin Ficheux, Nicolas Roch, Denis M. Basko
Abstract: When a small system is coupled to a bath, it is generally assumed that the state of the bath remains unaffected by the system due to the bath's large number of degrees of freedom. Here we show theoretically that this assumption can be easily violated for photonic baths typically used in experiments involving superconducting circuits. We analyze the dynamics of a voltage-biased Josephson junction coupled to a photonic bath, represented as a long Josephson junction chain. Our findings show that the system can reach a non-equilibrium steady state where the photonic degrees of freedom become significantly overheated, leading to a qualitative change in the current-voltage $I-V$ curve. This phenomenon is analogous to the Joule effect observed in electrical conductors, where flowing current can substantially heat up electrons. Recognizing this effect is crucial for the many applications of high-impedance environments in quantum technologies.

Title: Phase transitions and remnants of fractionalization at finite temperature in the triangular lattice quantum loop model
Authors: Xiaoxue Ran, Sylvain Capponi, Junchen Rong, Fabien Alet, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: The quantum loop and dimer models are archetypal correlated systems with local constraints. With natural foundations in statistical mechanics, they are of direct relevance to various important physical concepts and systems, such as topological order, lattice gauge theories, geometric frustrations, or more recently Rydberg arrays quantum simulators. However, how the thermal fluctuations interact with constraints has not been explored in the important class of non-bipartite geometries. Here we study, via unbiased quantum Monte Carlo simulations and field theoretical analysis, the finite-temperature phase diagram of the quantum loop model on the triangular lattice. We discover that the recently identified, "hidden" vison plaquette (VP) quantum crystal [1] experiences a finite-temperature continuous transition, which smoothly connects to the (2+1)d Cubic* quantum critical point separating the VP and $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid phases. This finite-temperature phase transition acquires a unique property of ``remnants of fractionalization" at finite temperature, in that, both the cubic order parameter -- the plaquette loop resonance -- and its constituent -- the vison field -- exhibit independent criticality signatures. This phase transition is connected to a 3-state Potts transition between the lattice nematic phase and the high-temperature disordered phase. We discuss the relevance of our results for current experiments on quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Structural characterization of the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe
Authors: Liam J. Scanlon, Santosh Bhusal, Christina M. Hoffmann, Junhong He, Sean R. Parkin, Brennan J. Arnold, William J. Gannon
Abstract: Weyl semimetals have a variety of intriguing physical properties, including topologically protected electronic states that coexist with conducting states. Possible exploitation of topologically protected states in a conducting material is promising for technological applications. Weyl semimetals that form in a noncentrosymmetric structure that also contain magnetic moments may host a variety of emergent phenomena that cannot be seen in magnetic, centrosymmetric Weyl materials. It can be difficult to distinguish definitively between a centrosymmetric structure and one of its noncentrosymmetric subgroups with standard powder X-ray diffractometers in cases where two atoms in the compound have nearly the same atomic number, as is the case for the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe. In these cases, a careful single-crystal neutron diffraction experiment with high-angle reflections provides complimentary information to X-ray diffraction and definitively resolves any ambiguity between centrosymmetric and noncentrosymmetric crystal structures. Single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements on the candidate Weyl semimetal CeGaGe confirm that its structure is noncentrosymmetric, described by space group 109 $\left(I4_1md\right)$ rather than the centrosymmetric space group 141 $\left(I4_1/amd\right)$. There are many high-angle reflections in the data set that give clear, physically intuitive evidence that CeGaGe forms with $I4_1md$ symmetry since Bragg planes of these reflections can contain Ga with no Ge or vice versa, whereas the Bragg planes for a structure with $I4_1/amd$ symmetry would have a mix of Ga and Ge. Further, in some crystals we have studied, there is clear evidence for a structural transition from body-centered $I4_1md$ symmetry to primitive $P4_3$ and/or $P4_1$ symmetry.

Title: Control, competition and coexistence of effective magnetic orders by interactions in Bose-Einstein condensates with high-Q cavities
Authors: Brahyam Ríos-Sánchez, Santiago F. Caballero-Benítez
Abstract: Ultracold atomic systems confined in optical cavities have been demonstrated as a laboratory for the control of quantum matter properties and analog quantum simulation. Often neglected, but soon amenable to manipulation in a new generation of experiments, we show that atomic many-body interactions allow additional control in the cavity driven self-organization of effective spinor Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC). We theoretically show that a rich landscape of magnetic ordering configurations emerges. This can be controlled by modifying the geometry of the light-fields in the system with the interplay of two-body interactions and the cavity induced interactions. This leads to competition scenarios and phase separated dynamics. Our results show that it is possible to tailor on demand configurations possibly useful for analog quantum simulation of magnetic materials with highly controllable parameters in a single experimentally realistic setup.

Title: Topological nature of edge states for one-dimensional systems without symmetry protection
Authors: Janet Zhong, Heming Wang, Alexander N Poddubny, Shanhui Fan
Abstract: We numerically verify and analytically prove a winding number invariant that correctly predicts the number of edge states in one-dimensional, nearest-neighbor (between unit cells), two-band models with any complex couplings and open boundaries. Our winding number uses analytical continuation of the wave-vector into the complex plane and involves two special points on the full Riemann surface band structure that correspond to bulk eigenvector degeneracies. Our winding number is invariant under unitary or similarity transforms. We emphasize that the topological criteria we propose here differ from what is traditionally defined as a topological or trivial phase in symmetry-protected classification studies. It is a broader invariant for our model that supports nonzero energy edge states and its transition does not coincide with the gap closing condition. When the relevant symmetries are applied, our invariant reduces to well-known Hermitian and non-Hermitian symmetry-protected topological invariants.

Title: Neural Canonical Transformations for Quantum Anharmonic Solids of Lithium
Authors: Qi Zhang, Xiaoyang Wang, Rong Shi, Xinguo Ren, Han Wang, Lei Wang
Abstract: Lithium is a typical quantum solid, characterized by cubic structures at ambient pressure. As the pressure increases, it forms more complex structures and undergoes a metal-to-semiconductor transformation, complicating theoretical and experimental analyses. We employ the neural canonical transformation approach, an \textit{ab initio} variational method based on probabilistic generative models, to investigate the quantum anharmonic effects in lithium solids at finite temperatures. This approach combines a normalizing flow for phonon excited-state wave functions with a probabilistic model for the occupation of energy levels, optimized jointly to minimize the free energy. Our results indicate that quantum anharmonicity lowers the \textit{bcc}-\textit{fcc} transition temperature compared to classical molecular dynamics predictions. At high pressures, the predicted fractional coordinates of lithium atoms in the \textit{cI16} structure show good quantitative agreement with experimental observations. Finally, contrary to previous beliefs, we find that the poor metallic \textit{oC88} structure is stabilized by the potential energy surface obtained via high-accuracy electronic structure calculations, rather than thermal or quantum nuclear effects.

Title: Magnetic Dichroism in Rutile NiF$_2$: Separating Altermagnetic and Ferromagnetic Effects
Authors: A. Hariki, K. Sakurai, T. Okauchi, J. Kuneš
Abstract: We present numerical simulations of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) at the L$_{2,3}$ edge of Ni in the weakly ferromagnetic altermagnet NiF$_2$. Our results predict a significant XMCD signal for light propagating perpendicular to the magnetic moments, which are approximately aligned along the [100] easy-axis direction. The analysis shows that the altermagnetic and ferromagnetic contributions to the XMCD signal can be uniquely distinguished by their dependence on an applied magnetic field. By varying the angle of the field relative to the easy axis, the in-plane orientation of both the Néel vector and the net magnetization can be systematically controlled. We further demonstrate that the XMCD signal, even under fields as strong as 40 T and for any in-plane orientation, can be accurately described as a linear combination of two spectral components, with geometrical prefactors determined by the field magnitude and direction. This insight enables experimental validation of the distinctive relationship between the Néel vector orientation and the x-ray Hall vector in the rutile structure. Quantitative simulations supporting these findings are provided.

Title: Optimal constrained control for generally damped Brownian heat engines
Authors: Monojit Chatterjee, Viktor Holubec, Rahul Marathe
Abstract: Optimization of cyclic stochastic heat engines, a topic spanning decades of research, commonly assumes fixed control or response parameters at discrete points in the cycle-a limitation that often leads to experimentally impractical protocols. We overcome this with a general algorithm, adapted from optimal control theory, that optimizes full-cycle dynamics under realistic constraints, such as stiffness and temperature bounds, across diverse systems. Unlike geometric or mass transport methods, which rely on fixed endpoints and are unsuitable for unconstrained cycles, our approach simultaneously tunes both cycle time and control variations. Applied to a generally damped Brownian particle in a harmonic potential-an experimentally relevant case-our method is validated in the overdamped regime and extended to arbitrary damping rates. As damping decreases, maximum power vanishes and cycle time diverges; at fixed cycle times, efficiency follows a similar trend, with optimal protocols exhibiting non-monotonic complexity. Notably, optimizing temperature profiles-often overlooked-significantly enhances efficiency in intermediate damping regimes. Our work establishes the first systematic framework for optimizing cyclic stochastic processes under experimental constraints, broadening the scope of power and efficiency optimization in nonequilibrium thermodynamics.

Title: A combined statistical mechanical and ab initio approach to understanding H2O/CO2 co-adsorption in mmen-Mg2(dobpdc)
Authors: Jonathan R. Owens, Bojun Feng, Jie Liu, David Moore
Abstract: We study the effects of H2O on CO2 adsorption in an amine-appended variant of the metal-organic framework Mg2(dobpdc), which is known to exhibit chaining behavior that presents in a step-shaped adsorption isotherm. We first show how the presence of different levels of local H2O affects this chaining behavior and the energetics of CO2 adsorption, based on a series of ab initio calculations, giving insight into the atomic-scale environment. In particular, we predict a novel adsorbed configuration, in which H2O and CO2 intertwine to make a braided chain down the MOF pore. We then show how an existing lattice model can be adapted to incorporate the effect of water, and predict the CO2 isotherms for the various water levels, observing a sharp shift the uptake at low partial pressures. The manifestation of this braided chain in the lattice model points to the potential emergence of a shift from cooperative capture to that of a phase transition. In addition to the physical insights, this work may serve as a launching off point for further work on this and related materials.

Title: Effective description of Taylor dispersion in strongly corrugated channels
Authors: Arthur Alexandre, Thomas Guérin, David S. Dean
Abstract: Taylor dispersion in periodic but highly corrugated channels is studied. Exact analytical expressions for the long-time diffusion constant and drift along the channel are derived to next-to-leading order in the limit of small channel period. Using these results we show how an effective model for Taylor dispersion in tortuous porous media can be framed in terms of dispersion in a uniform channel with absorption/desorption at its surface, an effective slip length for the flow at the surface and an effective, universal, diffusion constant on the surface. This work thus extends the concept of an effective slip-length for hydrodynamics flows to Taylor dispersion by those flows. The analytical results are confirmed by numerical calculations, and present a robust method to understand and upscale the transport properties of flows in porous media.

Title: Dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard Model Induced by On-Site or Long-Range Two-Body Losses
Authors: Julien Despres, Leonardo Mazza, Marco Schirò
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the dissipative dynamics of the Bose-Hubbard model induced by on-site or long-range two-body losses. We first consider the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice, and study the dynamics induced by the sudden switch-on of two-body losses on a weakly-interacting superfluid state. The time-dependent density is obtained in the spirit of the Bogolyubov approach by calculating theoretically the equations of motion associated to the relevant quadratic bosonic correlators. In the one-dimensional case, our results compare very well with quasi-exact numerical calculations based on the quantum jump method implemented using tensor networks. We find that the intermediate-time dynamics of the density displays an algebraic decay characterized by an interaction-dependent power-law exponent. The latter property still holds for long-range two-body loss processes but it is absent in the two-dimensional square lattice with on-site losses.

Title: Transmission through multiple Mott insulator - semiconductor wells
Authors: Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer
Abstract: Weakly and strongly interacting quantum many-body systems, namely semiconductors and Mott insulators, are combined into a layered heterostructure. Via the hierarchy of correlations, we derive and match the propagating quasi-particle solutions in the different regions and calculate the transmission coefficients through these layered structures. As a proof of principle, we find the well known transmission bands of a semiconductor heterostructure. Extending this idea to semiconductor and Mott insulator structures we calculate the transmittance and the resonance energies. Within a phase accumulation model we find analytical expressions for the scattering phase shift. Lastly, we find transmission curves with skewness for structures with applied voltage.

Title: Nonlinear electron-phonon interactions in Migdal-Eliashberg theory
Authors: Ingvar Zappacosta, Matthew Houtput, Jacques Tempere
Abstract: Superconducting systems based on attractive electron-phonon interactions are the ones which are best understood at a fundamental level. They are well described using Eliashberg theory, which, unlike BCS theory, explicitly takes into account phonon dynamics. It is most often assumed that only linear electron-phonon interactions are relevant. However, for some superconductors like MgB$_2$ or hydride based superconductors, nonlinear electron-phonon interactions are known to contribute significantly, which is not taken into account in conventional Eliashberg theory. We provide a modification to Eliashberg theory by introducing nonlinear electron-phonon interactions. We show that the Eliashberg equations remain unchanged apart from a nonlinear extension of the Eliashberg spectral function. This extended spectral function can be used as a baseline for future ab initio calculations. We use it to construct an analytical toy model and show that the nonlinear electron-phonon coupling affects the superconducting gap function on the imaginary and real axis and causes an increase in the superconducting critical temperature.

Title: Long-range Entanglement and Role of Realistic Interaction in Braiding of Non-Abelian Quasiholes in Fractional Quantum Hall Phases
Authors: Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Bo Yang
Abstract: Parity conservation dictates that when fusing pairs of Moore-Read (MR) quasiholes, such that each pair of charge-$e/4$ anyon forms a charge-$e/2$ anyon, the parity of the numbers of $1$-anyon and $\psi$-anyon must be conserved within a given system. This idea is illustrated here using the Jack polynomial formalism, which also provides a basis to numerically study the dynamics of MR anyons. In particular, we examine the effect of two-body electron-electron interaction on the degeneracy of two anyon fusion channels, which affects their mutual statistics of the MR anyons. We find that parity conservation gives rise to a long-range ``entanglement" which affect the experimental measurement of exchange statistics under realistic electron interaction. It is therefore important to account for all quasiholes in an experimental systems in order to accurately predict the outcome of a certain measurement. We also show how understanding the quasihole dynamics can help to fine-tune two-body interactions in order to stabilize any given fusion channel in experiments.

Title: Intrinsic superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal superconductivity in rhombohedral graphene multilayers
Authors: Yinqi Chen, Mathias S. Scheurer, Constantin Schrade
Abstract: Recent experiments have revealed that superconductivity in rhombohedral tetralayer graphene can emerge from a valley-polarized and, hence, chiral normal state. The interplay of pairing and the reduced normal-state symmetries sparked widespread interest. In this work, we demonstrate within a microscopic theoretical formalism that this stabilizes a non-reciprocal superconducting state. Our results are based on a fully self-consistent framework for determining the superconducting order parameter from a Kohn-Luttinger mechanism. We show that the system displays a sizeable intrinsic superconducting diode effect, i.e., without the need for applying external magnetic fields, which is also highly tunable by an external displacement field. Moreover, we find that the angular dependence of the critical current is highly sensitive to the Fermi surfaces of the normal state. Hence, our results suggest that the critical current could provide insights into the type of Fermi surface topology from which superconductivity arises.

Title: Machine Learning - Driven Materials Discovery: Unlocking Next-Generation Functional Materials -- A minireview
Authors: Dilshod Nematov, Mirabbos Hojamberdiev
Abstract: The rapid advancement of machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI)-driven techniques is revolutionizing materials discovery, property prediction, and material design by minimizing human intervention and accelerating scientific progress. This review provides a comprehensive overview of smart, machine learning (ML)-driven approaches, emphasizing their role in predicting material properties, discovering novel compounds, and optimizing material structures. Key methodologies ranging from deep learning, graph neural networks, and Bayesian optimization to automated generative models, such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) and variational autoencoders (VAEs) enable the autonomous design of materials with tailored functionalities. By leveraging AutoML frameworks (e.g., AutoGluon, TPOT, and this http URL), researchers can automate the model selection, hyperparameter tuning, and feature engineering, significantly improving the efficiency of materials informatics. Furthermore, the integration of AI-driven robotic laboratories and high-throughput computing has established a fully automated pipeline for rapid synthesis and experimental validation, drastically reducing the time and cost of material discovery. This review highlights real-world applications of automated ML-driven approaches in predicting mechanical, thermal, electrical, and optical properties of materials, demonstrating successful cases in superconductors, catalysts, photovoltaics, and energy storage systems. We also address key challenges, such as data quality, interpretability, and the integration of AutoML with quantum computing, which are essential for future advancements. Ultimately, the synergy between AI, automated experimentation, and computational modeling transforms the way the materials are discovered, optimized, and designed, paving the way for next-generation innovations in energy, electronics, and nanotechnology.

Title: Quantum shockwave at the quasi-relativistic resonance
Authors: Marinko Jablan
Abstract: Shockwaves are violent nonlinear distortions of wave motion which have been reported in fluid waves and electromagnetic waves, while here we reveal that a shockwave can occur even in the quantum wave function of a single particle. Specifically, we analyze the electromagnetic field travelling on resonance with the limiting velocity of the quasi-relativistic particle, and reveal that a strong longitudinal field can rip up a quantum shockwave singularity in the particle wave function, leading to energy dissipation. Moreover, we show that this effect is particularly strong for quasi-relativistic (Dirac) electrons in graphene for two reasons. On one hand, we obtain the single-particle shockwave at very small fields due to the small effective electron mass, and on the other hand we can obtain large dissipation in the many-particle shockwave by using the large electron density in graphene. While the single-particle shockwave can be most easily observed by locating the shockwave singularity with a high-resolution microscopy, the many-particle dissipation would be simply observed as a rapid decay of our resonant electromagnetic field.

Title: Preliminary experimental investigation on the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow
Authors: Durbar Roy, Ikbal Ahmed, Abdul Hakkim, Rama Govindarajan
Abstract: We study the interaction of a subaqueous dune like granular structure with a turbulent open channel flow experimentally using optical diagnostics in the Shields and Froude parameter space ($0.05{\leq}{\theta}{\leq}0.32$, $0.1{\leq}Fr{\leq}0.4$). Interactions between the turbulent flow and the granular structure give rise to transient erosion-deposition dynamics leading to various types of particle transport. The subaqueous structures in the channel bed evolves due to shear-stress-induced erosion, gravity-driven deposition, and subsequent particle transport. We study the centroid motion and the granular structure shape evolution. At lower end of our ${\theta}-Fr$ parameter space, we observe no erosion and the structure remains at rest. We show that the critical Shields number (${\theta}_{cr}$) is of the order of $0.1$ beyond which erosion starts to occur. At intermediate values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ we observe slow erosion, resulting in a rigid body motion of the granular structure without significant shape deformation. Higher values of ${\theta}$ and $Fr$ causes vortex formation at the upstream of the dune resulting in stronger erosion, rapid shape deformation and relatively higher translation velocity of the centroid.

Title: Spin stiffnesses and stability of magnetic order in the lightly doped two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Demetrio Vilardi, Pietro M. Bonetti, Walter Metzner
Abstract: We analyze the density dependence of the spin stiffnesses and the stability of magnetic order with respect to quantum fluctuations in the two-dimensional Hubbard model close to half-filling. The stiffnesses are computed from the spin susceptibility obtained from a random phase approximation in a magnetically ordered state. For a sizable next-to-nearest neighbor hopping amplitude and a moderate Hubbard interaction, the mean-field ground state is a Néel antiferromagnet in the electron doped regime at and above half-filling, and a planar circular spiral state in the hole doped regime below half-filling. Upon electron doping, the Néel stiffness decreases smoothly and not very steeply. By contrast, the in-plane and out-of-plane stiffnesses in the spiral state drop abruptly at half-filling. The out-of-plane stiffness even drops to zero, and then increases again very slowly upon increasing hole doping. At finite temperatures, the Néel-to-spiral transition is shifted into the hole doped regime, the stiffnesses are continuous functions of the density, and they vanish at the transition. For small hole doping, the spin stiffnesses describe the quantum fluctuations only in a small momentum range, which shrinks to zero upon approaching half-filling. Using the above results, we show that the quantum ground state of the lightly electron doped Hubbard model remains Néel ordered, while quantum fluctuations probably destroy the spiral long-range order in the hole doped regime, giving rise to a quantum disordered state with a spin gap.

Title: Emergence of Spin-Polarized Unconventional Skin Effect in Hatano-Nelson Model
Authors: Moirangthem Sanahal, Subhasis Panda, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect (NHSE), a hallmark of non-Hermitian systems, stems from the topological nature of complex energy spectra, typically characterized by a nonzero spectral winding number. By investigating a one-dimensional Hatano-Nelson model with spin-dependent Abelian gauge fields, we uncover a tunable, spin-polarized, unconventional NHSE with zero spectral winding, coexisting with a conventional one. These unconventional skin modes, emerging in the absence of pseudo time-reversal symmetry, display scale-restricted localization and non-Bloch spectral stability, distinguishing them from the Z2 and critical NHSEs. By introducing an external magnetic field that couples the spin degrees of freedom, these unconventional skin modes evolve into critical skin states. Meanwhile, conventional ones persist, but undergo a transition from bidirectional to unidirectional accumulation with increasing field strength. While distinct, remarkably, this unconventional NHSE manifests a more general behavior, with the Z2 and critical NHSEs emerging as specific limiting cases. Our results provide experimentally accessible predictions relevant to photonic lattices and ultracold atomic systems with synthetic gauge fields.

Title: Observing structural disorder induced interacting topological phase in an atom array
Authors: Zongpei Yue, Yu-Feng Mao, Xinhui Liang, Zhen-Xing Hua, Peiyun Ge, Yu-Xin Chao, Kai Li, Chen Jia, Meng Khoon Tey, Yong Xu, Li You
Abstract: Topological phases of matter can appear in noninteracting systems, as in band topology, or interacting systems, such as in spin models, with their defining features typically robust against weak disorder. Intriguingly, disorder itself can also induce topological phases--exemplified by the Anderson topological insulator in noninteracting systems. Experimental studies on disorder induced topology have so far been limited to band topology. Here we report direct observations of structural disorder induced many-body interacting topological phase in an atom array at half-filling, whereby random offsets to tweezer locations forming a lattice implement structural disorder, causing fluctuating long-range dipolar interactions between tweezer confined single atoms. The ground state degeneracy in disordered configurations is detected and compared to a regular lattice. The induced topological phase is also vindicated by the spatially resolved atom-atom correlation functions for different forms of dimer compositions. By probing the quench dynamics of a highly excited state, we observe markedly slower decay of edge spin magnetization in comparison to the bulk spin one, consistent with the presence of topologically protected edge modes in disordered lattices. Our experiments open a new direction for studying the interplay between structural disorder and strongly interacting topological matter in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Comparative Analysis of GFN Methods in Geometry Optimization of Small Organic Semiconductor Molecules: A DFT Benchmarking Study
Authors: Steve Cabrel Teguia Kouam, Jean-Pierre Tchapet Njafa, Raoult Dabou Teukam, Patrick Mvoto Kongo, Jean-Pierre Nguenang, Serge Guy Nana Engo
Abstract: This study benchmarks the GFN family of semiempirical methods (GFN1-xTB, GFN2-xTB, GFN0-xTB, and GFN-FF) against density functional theory (DFT) for the evaluation of optimized molecular geometries and electronic properties of small organic semiconductor molecules. This work offers a systematic assessment of these computationally efficient quantum chemical methods and their accuracy-cost profiles when applied to a challenging class of systems, characterized, for instance, by extended $\pi$-conjugation, conformational flexibility, and sensitivity of properties to subtle structural changes. Two datasets are evaluated: a QM9-derived subset of small organic molecules and the Harvard Clean Energy Project (CEP) database of extended $\pi$-systems relevant to organic photovoltaics. Structural agreement is quantified using heavy-atom RMSD, equilibrium rotational constants, bond lengths, and angles, while electronic property prediction is assessed via HOMO-LUMO energy gaps. Computational efficiency is assessed via CPU time and scaling behavior. GFN1-xTB and GFN2-xTB demonstrate the highest structural fidelity, while GFN-FF offers an optimal balance between accuracy and speed, particularly for larger systems. The results indicate that GFN-based methods are suitable for high-throughput molecular screening of small organic semiconductors, with the choice of method depending on accuracy-cost trade-offs. The findings support the deployment of GFN approaches in computational pipelines for the discovery of organic electronics and materials, providing information on their strengths and limitations relative to established DFT methods.

Title: Full, three-quarter, half and quarter Wigner crystals in Bernal bilayer graphene
Authors: Enrique Aguilar-Méndez, Titus Neupert, Glenn Wagner
Abstract: Application of a displacement field opens a gap and enhances the Van-Hove singularities in the band structure of Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene. By adjusting the carrier density so that the Fermi energy lies in the vicinity of these singularities, recent experiments observe a plethora of highly correlated electronic phases including isospin polarized phases and high-resistance states with non-linear electric transport indicative of a possible Wigner crystal. We perform Hartree-Fock calculations incorporating long-range Coulomb interactions and allowing for translational and rotational symmetry breaking. We obtain the displacement field vs. carrier density phase diagram which shows isospin polarized metallic phases tracking the Van-Hove singularity in the valence band. Between these metallic phases we observe regions where the ground state is a Wigner crystal. The isospin polarization of the Wigner crystals tracks the isospin polarization of the nearby metallic phases. Depending on whether we have four, three, two or one isospin flavours, we obtain a full, three-quarter, half or quarter Wigner crystal.

Title: Topological electron and phonon flat bands in novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba)
Authors: Jiefeng Ye, Zhigao Huang, Xianxin Wu, Jian-Min Zhang
Abstract: Fermionic and bosonic localized states induced by geometric frustration in the kagome lattice provide a distinctive research platform for investigating emergent exotic quantum phenomena in strongly correlated systems. Here, we report the discovery of coexisting electronic and phononic flat bands induced by geometric frustration in a novel kagome superconductor XPd5 (X=Ca, Sr, Ba). The electronic flat band is located around the Fermi level and possesses a nontrivial topological invariant with Z2=1. Additionaly, we identify multiple van Hove singularities (vHS) arise from the kagome Pd d orbitals with distinct dispersion and sublattice features, including conventional, higher-order vHS and p-type, m-type vHS. Specifically, our investigation of the vibrational modes of the phononic flat band reveals that its formation originates from destructive interference between adjacent kagome lattice sites with antiphase vibrational modes. A spring-mass model of phonons is established to probe the physical mechanism of the phononic flat bands. Furthermore, the calculations of electron-phonon coupling in the XPd5 reveal superconducting ground states with critical temperatures (Tc) of 4.25 K, 2.75 K, and 3.35 K for CaPd5, SrPd5, and BaPd5, respectively. This work provides a promising platform to explore the Fermion-boson many-body interplay and superconducting states, while simultaneously establishing a novel analytical framework to elucidate the origin of phononic flat bands in quantum materials.

Title: Emergent Orbital Dynamics in Strongly Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems
Authors: A. S. Miñarro, G. Herranz
Abstract: The interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom gives rise to a variety of emergent phases in correlated 4d and 5d transition-metal systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly alters Jahn-Teller (JT) physics, often suppressing static distortions or promoting dynamic fluctuations, thereby reducing or even quenching orbital polarization. While intersite hybridization is a fundamental aspect of crystalline solids, its role in shaping the dynamics of spin-orbit-entangled states has received comparatively little attention. Here, we show that electronic hopping can locally restore orbital polarization when the ground state is perturbed, even in the absence of static orbital order. Using a Matsubara lattice formalism, we analyze how local orbital perturbations propagate through correlated, spin-orbit-entangled systems. When intersite hopping is included, such perturbations induce short-range orbital polarization with a characteristic orthogonal response at nearest-neighbor sites. Although the energy scale of these hybridization-driven orbital reconstructions likely makes their detection challenging, they may still influence low-energy spectral features and interact with other excitations. These results underscore the importance of including orbital dynamics in the interpretation of spectroscopic data and provide a framework for understanding dynamical responses in spin-orbit-entangled materials.

Title: Agent-based Monte Carlo simulations for reaction-diffusion models, population dynamics, and epidemic spreading
Authors: Mohamed Swailem (Stony Brook), Ulrich Dobramysl (Oxford), Ruslan Mukhamadiarov (LMU Munich), Uwe C. Täuber (Virginia Tech)
Abstract: We provide an overview of Monte Carlo algorithms based on Markovian stochastic dynamics of interacting and reacting many-particle systems not in thermal equilibrium. These agent-based simulations are an effective way of introducing students to current research without requiring much prior knowledge or experience. By starting from the direct visualization of the data, students can gain immediate insight into emerging macroscopic features of a complex system and subsequently apply more sophisticated data analysis to quantitatively characterize its rich dynamical properties, both in the stationary and transient regimes. We utilize simulations of reaction-diffusion systems, stochastic models for population dynamics and epidemic spreading, to exemplify how interdisciplinary computational research can be effectively utilized in bottom-up undergraduate and graduate education through learning by doing. We also give helpful hints for the practical implementation of Monte Carlo algorithms, provide sample codes, explain some typical data analysis tools, and describe various potential error sources and pitfalls and tips for avoiding them.

Title: teMatDb: A High-Quality Thermoelectric Material Database with Self-Consistent ZT Filtering
Authors: Byungki Ryu, Ji Hui Son, Sungjin Park, Jaywan Chung, Hye-Jin Lim, SuJi Park, Yujeong Do, SuDong Park
Abstract: This study presents a curated thermoelectric material database, teMatDb, constructed by digitizing literature-reported data. It includes temperature-dependent thermoelectric properties (TEPs), Seebeck coefficient, electrical resistivity, thermal conductivity, and figure of merit (ZT), along with metadata on materials and their corresponding publications. A self-consistent ZT (Sc-ZT) filter set was developed to measure ZT errors by comparing reported ZT's from figures with ZT's recalculated from digitized TEPs. Using this Sc-ZT protocol, we generated tMatDb272, comprising 14,717 temperature-property pairs from 272 high-quality TEP sets across 262 publications. The method identifies various types of ZT errors, such as resolution error, publication bias, ZT overestimation, interpolation and extrapolation error, and digitization noise, and excludes inconsistent samples from the dataset. teMatDb272 and the Sc-ZT filtering framework offer a robust dataset for data-driven and machine-learning-based materials design, device modeling, and future thermoelectric research.

Title: Symmetry-broken charge-ordered ground state in CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ Kagome metal
Authors: Manex Alkorta, Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Chunyu Guo, Philip J. W. Moll, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Errea
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) offers a unique platform for studying the interplay between a charge density wave transition with superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry. Despite characterizing the charge density wave phase is crucial to understand and model all these exotic properties, it remains unresolved. In this work, we use first-principles calculations of the free-energy, incorporating both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results reveal a competition between metastable stacking orders of the reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers, which are energetically favored to form exclusively a triangular-hexagonal arrangement, allowing the possibility of competitive different domains and chiral order. Consistent with experimental observations, we find that the $2\times2\times2$ and $2\times2\times4$ modulations are nearly degenerate in free energy, and are abruptly melted into the high-symmetry hexagonal phase around 90 K. The transition is first-order but compatible with a measurable phonon-softening. Remarkably, even if the six-fold and inversion symmetry are intrinsically broken by the out-of-plane stacking, this does not lead to measurable anisotropy in the in-plane conductivity as suggested by measurements.

Title: Disentangling hierarchical relaxations in glass formers via dynamic eigenmodes
Authors: Wensi Sun, Yanshuang Chen, Wencheng Ji, Yi Zhou, Hua Tong, Ke Chen, Xiaosong Chen, Hajime Tanaka, Peng Tan
Abstract: Hierarchical dynamics in glass-forming systems span multiple timescales, from fast vibrations to slow structural rearrangements, appearing in both supercooled fluids and glassy states. Understanding how these diverse processes interact across timescales remains a central challenge. Here, by combining direct particle-level observations with a dynamic eigenmode approach that decomposes intermediate-timescale responses into distinct modes, we reveal the microscopic organisation of relaxation dynamics in two-dimensional colloidal systems. We identify five classes of modes characterizing hierarchical dynamics: (i) quasi-elastic modes, (ii) slow-reversible string modes contributing to dynamic heterogeneity, (iii) slow-irreversible string modes leading to flow, (iv) fast-$\beta$ modes with fast-reversible strings, and (v) random noise modes. The emergence of quasi-elastic modes marks the onset of glassy dynamics, while reversible string modes dominate dynamic heterogeneity throughout both supercooled and glassy regimes. Our findings offer a unified microscopic framework for understanding how distinct relaxation processes interconnect across timescales, illuminating the mechanisms driving glass formation.

Title: Noisy Qudit vs Multiple Qubits : Conditions on Gate Efficiency for Enhancing Fidelity
Authors: Denis Janković, Jean-Gabriel Hartmann, Mario Ruben, Paul-Antoine Hervieux
Abstract: Today, multiple new platforms are implementing qudits, $d$-level quantum bases of information, for Quantum Information Processing (QIP). It is therefore crucial to study their efficiencies for QIP compared to more traditional qubit platforms. We present a comparative study of the infidelity scalings of a qudit and $n$-qubit systems, both with identical Hilbert space dimensions and noisy environments. The first-order response of the Average Gate Infidelity (AGI) to the noise in the Lindblad formalism, which was found to be gate-independent, was calculated analytically in the two systems being compared. This yielded a critical curve $O(d^2/\log_2(d))$ of the ratio of their respective gate times in units of decoherence time. This quantity indicates how time-efficient operations on these systems are. The curve delineates regions where each system has a higher rate of increase of the AGI than the other. This condition on gate efficiency was applied to different existing platforms. It was found that specific qudit platforms possess gate efficiencies competitive with state-of-the-art qubit platforms. Numerical simulations complemented this work and allowed for discussion of the applicability and limits of the linear response formalism.

Title: Mitigating Molecular Aggregation in Drug Discovery with Predictive Insights from Explainable AI
Authors: Hunter Sturm, Jonas Teufel, Kaitlin A. Isfeld, Pascal Friederich, Rebecca L. Davis
Abstract: Herein, we present the application of MEGAN, our explainable AI (xAI) model, for the identification of small colloidally aggregating molecules (SCAMs). This work offers solutions to the long-standing problem of false positives caused by SCAMs in high throughput screening for drug discovery and demonstrates the power of xAI in the classification of molecular properties that are not chemically intuitive based on our current understanding. We leverage xAI insights and molecular counterfactuals to design alternatives to problematic compounds in drug screening libraries. Additionally, we experimentally validate the MEGAN prediction classification for one of the counterfactuals and demonstrate the utility of counterfactuals for altering the aggregation properties of a compound through minor structural modifications. The integration of this method in high-throughput screening approaches will help combat and circumvent false positives, providing better lead molecules more rapidly and thus accelerating drug discovery cycles.

Title: On the choice of non-linear terms in blocking cat states by energy conservation
Authors: Leonardo De Carlo
Abstract: In [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] I considered the problem of wavefunction ensembles for spin models. To observe magnetization at finite temperature, I had to add macroscopic nonlinear terms blocking macroscopic superpositions by energy conservation. The nonlinear terms were of the kind introduced in [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] to block spatial cats by energy conservation as solution to the Measurement Problem. Reviewing the theory from [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:1908.02352 (2019)], I derive a commutation relation that these nonlinear terms have to satisfy to be admitted and show that the terms of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017), arXiv:2008.08663 (2020)] restricting the wavefunctions in space satisfies such relations. I generalize the terms of [Entropy 25, 564 (2023)] for non-pure spin models and check if they also satisfy the constraints, concluding with a negative answer. An experimental estimate to test the proposal of [W.D. Wick, arXiv:1710.03278 (2017)] is described at the end.

Title: Quantum Dynamics with Stochastic Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Pablo Martinez-Azcona, Aritra Kundu, Avadh Saxena, Adolfo del Campo, Aurelia Chenu
Abstract: We study the quantum dynamics generated by a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian subject to stochastic perturbations in its anti-Hermitian part, describing fluctuating gains and losses. The dynamics averaged over the noise is described by an `anti-dephasing' master equation. We characterize the resulting state evolution and analyze its purity. The properties of such dynamics are illustrated in a stochastic dissipative qubit. Our analytical results show that adding noise allows for a rich control of the dynamics, stabilizing the lossy state and making state purification possible to a greater variety of steady states.

Title: Optimal Distillation of Coherent States with Phase-Insensitive Operations
Authors: Shiv Akshar Yadavalli, Iman Marvian
Abstract: By combining multiple copies of noisy coherent states of light (or other bosonic systems), it is possible to obtain a single mode in a state with lesser noise, a process known as distillation or purification of coherent states. We investigate the distillation of coherent states from coherent thermal states under general phase-insensitive operations, and find a distillation protocol that is optimal in the asymptotic regime, i.e., when the number of input copies is much greater than 1. Remarkably, we find that in this regime, the error -- as quantified by infidelity (one minus the fidelity) of the output state with the desired coherent state -- is proportional to the inverse of the purity of coherence of the input state, a quantity obtained from the Right-Logarithmic-Derivative (RLD) Fisher information metric, hence revealing an operational interpretation of this quantity. The heart of this protocol is a phase-insensitive channel that optimally converts an input coherent thermal state with high amplitude, into an output with significantly lower amplitude and temperature. Under this channel, the purity of coherence remains asymptotically conserved. While both the input and desired output are Gaussian states, we find that the optimal protocol cannot be a Gaussian channel. Among Gaussian phase-insensitive channels, the optimal distillation protocol is a simple linear optical scheme that can be implemented with beam splitters.

Title: Spin systems as quantum simulators of quantum field theories in curved spacetimes
Authors: Shunichiro Kinoshita, Keiju Murata, Daisuke Yamamoto, Ryosuke Yoshii
Abstract: We demonstrate that a quantum field theory (QFT) in general two-dimensional curved spacetimes can be realized by a system of quantum spins or qubits. We consider a spin-1/2 model on a one-dimensional ring with spatially and temporally varying exchange couplings and magnetic fields. This model reduces to a QFT of Majorana fermions in the continuum limit. From this correspondence, we establish a dictionary for translating between the spacetime-dependent parameters of the spin model and the general metric on which the QFT is defined. After addressing the general case, we consider the Friedmann-Lema\^ıtre-Robertson-Walker (FLRW) metric as a simple example. According to the dictionary, the QFT of Majorana fermions on the FLRW metric corresponds to the Ising model with a time-dependent transverse magnetic field. We demonstrate that the production of Majorana particles in the expanding universe can be simulated with the transverse-field Ising model by increasing the strength of the magnetic field. Furthermore, we examine the Unruh effect through the spin system by using our prescription and show the direct relation between the entanglement (or modular) Hamiltonian in the spin system and the Rindler Hamiltonian. This approach provides an experimentally viable system for probing various phenomena in QFT within curved spacetime, while also opening the door to uncovering nontrivial phenomena in spin systems inspired by curved spacetime physics. It offers fresh perspectives on both QFT in curved spacetimes and quantum many-body spin systems, revealing profound connections between these fields.

Title: Optomechanical self-organization in a mesoscopic atom array
Authors: Jacquelyn Ho, Yue-Hui Lu, Tai Xiang, Cosimo C. Rusconi, Stuart J. Masson, Ana Asenjo-Garcia, Zhenjie Yan, Dan M. Stamper-Kurn
Abstract: Increasing the number of particles in a system often leads to qualitative changes in its properties, such as breaking of symmetries and the appearance of phase transitions. This renders a macroscopic system fundamentally different from its individual microscopic constituents. Lying between these extremes, mesoscopic systems exhibit microscopic fluctuations that influence behavior on longer length scales, leading to critical phenomena and dynamics. Therefore, tracing the properties of well-controlled mesoscopic systems can help bridge the gap between an exact description of few-body microscopic systems and the emergent description of many-body systems. Here, we explore mesoscopic signatures of an optomechanical self-organization phase transition using arrays of cold atoms inside an optical cavity. By precisely engineering atom-cavity interactions, we reveal how critical behavior depends on atom number, identify characteristic dynamical behaviors in the self-organized regime, and observe a finite optomechanical susceptibility at the critical point. These findings advance our understanding of particle-number- and time-resolved properties of phase transitions in mesoscopic systems.

Title: On computational complexity of unitary and state design properties
Authors: Yoshifumi Nakata, Yuki Takeuchi, Martin Kliesch, Andrew Darmawan
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.

Title: Dynamics of edge modes in monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger Models
Authors: Giulia Salatino, Gianluca Passarelli, Angelo Russomanno, Giuseppe E. Santoro, Procolo Lucignano, Rosario Fazio
Abstract: We investigate the effect of dissipation on the dynamics of edge modes in the monitored Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model. Our study considers both a linear observable and a nonlinear entanglement measure, namely the two-point correlation function and the Disconnected Entanglement Entropy (DEE), as diagnostic tools. While dissipation inevitably alters the entanglement properties observed in the closed system, statistical analysis of quantum trajectories reveals that by protecting the chain's edges from dissipation, it is possible to recover characteristic features analogous to those found in the unitary limit. This highlights the fundamental role of spatial dissipation patterns in shaping the dynamics of edge modes in monitored systems.

Title: A Generation Framework with Strict Constraints for Crystal Materials Design
Authors: Chao Huang, Jiahui Chen, Chen Chen, Chunyan Chen, Renjie Su, Shiyu Du, ChenChen, Hongrui Liang, Daojing Lin
Abstract: The design of crystal materials plays a critical role in areas such as new energy development, biomedical engineering, and semiconductors. Recent advances in data-driven methods have enabled the generation of diverse crystal structures. However, most existing approaches still rely on random sampling without strict constraints, requiring multiple post-processing steps to identify stable candidates with the desired physical and chemical properties. In this work, we present a new constrained generation framework that takes multiple constraints as input and enables the generation of crystal structures with specific chemical and properties. In this framework, intermediate constraints, such as symmetry information and composition ratio, are generated by a constraint generator based on large language models (LLMs), which considers the target properties. These constraints are then used by a subsequent crystal structure generator to ensure that the structure generation process is under control. Our method generates crystal structures with a probability of meeting the target properties that is more than twice that of existing approaches. Furthermore, nearly 100% of the generated crystals strictly adhere to predefined chemical composition, eliminating the risks of supply chain during production.

Title: Strong-coupling quantum thermodynamics using a superconducting flux qubit
Authors: Rishabh Upadhyay, Bayan Karimi, Diego Subero, Christoforus Dimas Satrya, Joonas T. Peltonen, Yu-Cheng Chang, Jukka P. Pekola
Abstract: Thermodynamics in quantum circuits aims to find improved functionalities of thermal machines, highlight fundamental phenomena peculiar to quantum nature in thermodynamics, and point out limitations in quantum information processing due to coupling of the system to its environment. An important aspect to achieve some of these goals is the regime of strong coupling that has remained until now a domain of theoretical works only. Our aim is to demonstrate strong coupling features in heat transport using a superconducting flux qubit, which is capable of reaching strong to deep-ultra strong coupling regimes, as shown in previous studies. Here, we show experimental evidence of strong coupling by observing a hybridized state of the qubit with two cavities coupled to it, leading to a triplet-like thermal transport via this combined system around the minimum energy of the qubit, at power levels of tens of femtowatts, exceeding by an order of magnitude those in earlier experiments. We also demonstrate close to 100% on-off switching ratio of heat current mediated by photons by applying magnetic flux to the qubit. Our experiment opens a way towards testing debated questions in strong coupling thermodynamics such as what heat in this regime is. We also present a theoretical model that aligns with our experimental findings and explains the mechanism behind heat transport in our device. Furthermore, our experiment opens new possibilities for quantum thermodynamics, aiming to realize true quantum heat engines and refrigerators with enhanced power and efficiency, by leveraging ultra-strong coupling between the system and its environment in future experiments.

Title: Software-defined lock-in demodulator for low-frequency resistance noise measurements
Authors: Tim Thyzel
Abstract: The resolution of low-frequency resistance noise measurements can be increased by amplitude modulation, shifting the spectrum of the resistance fluctuations away from the 1/f noise contributed by measurement instruments. However, commercial lock-in amplifiers used for de-modulating the fluctuations exhibit a problematic 1/f noise contribution, which imposes a hard lower limit on the relative resistance noise that can be detected. We replace the lock-in amplifier hardware by equivalent digital signal processing performed using open-source software and off-the-shelf data acquisition systems. Compared to previous implementations of the lock-in principle, our solution offers real-time preview capabilities and is resource-efficient for long acquisition times at high sampling rates. Importantly, compared to high-end commercial lock-in instruments, our system offers superior low-frequency noise performance with a reduction of the voltage power spectral density by about two orders of magnitude.

Title: 1d Ising model with $1/r^{1.99}$ interaction
Authors: Dario Benedetti, Edoardo Lauria, Dalimil Mazáč, Philine van Vliet
Abstract: We study the 1d Ising model with long-range interactions decaying as $1/r^{1+s}$. The critical model corresponds to a family of 1d conformal field theories (CFTs) whose data depends nontrivially on $s$ in the range $1/2\leq s\leq 1$. The model is known to be described by a generalized free field with quartic interaction, which is weakly coupled near $s=1/2$ but strongly coupled near the short-range crossover at $s=1$. We propose a dual description which becomes weakly coupled at $s=1$. At $s=1$, our model becomes an exactly solvable conformal boundary condition for the 2d free scalar. We perform a number of consistency checks of our proposal and calculate the perturbative CFT data around $s=1$ analytically using both 1) our proposed field theory and 2) the analytic conformal bootstrap. Our results show complete agreement between the two methods.

Title: Traveling Bubbles and Vortex Pairs within Symmetric 2D Quantum Droplets
Authors: Angel Paredes, Jose Guerra-Carmenate, Jose R. Salgueiro, Daniele Tommasini, Humberto Michinel
Abstract: We disclose a class of stable nonlinear traveling waves moving at specific constant velocities within symmetric two-dimensional quantum droplets. We present a comprehensive analysis of these traveling bubbles and identify three qualitatively distinct regions within the one-parameter family of solutions, classified by velocity: (i) well-separated phase singularities at low velocity, (ii) singularities within the same density dip at intermediate velocity, and (iii) rarefaction pulses without singularities at higher (subsonic) velocities. Then, we generalize the discussion to unstable cases, incorporating higher order vortex-antivortex pairs and arrays of vortices that move cohesively with a common velocity within the fluid. In all cases, we provide analytic approximations that aid the understanding of the results in different regimes.

Title: Long-lived multilevel coherences and spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states of ultracold molecules
Authors: Tom R. Hepworth, Daniel K. Ruttley, Fritz von Gierke, Philip D. Gregory, Alexander Guttridge, Simon L. Cornish
Abstract: Rotational states of ultracold polar molecules possess long radiative lifetimes, microwave-domain coupling, and tunable dipolar interactions. The availability of numerous rotational states has inspired many proposed applications, including simulations of quantum magnetism, encodings of information in high-dimensional qudits, and synthetic dimensions with many synthetic lattice sites. Many of these applications are yet to be realised, primarily because engineering long-lived coherent superpositions of multiple rotational states is highly challenging. Here, we investigate how multilevel coherences between rotational states can be engineered by using optical tweezer traps operating close to a magic wavelength for a given pair of states. By performing precision Ramsey spectroscopy we find the exact magic wavelengths and sensitivities to detuning errors for multiple rotational state superpositions. We find that, for a trap polarised parallel to the quantisation axis, the magic wavelengths are closely clustered enabling long-lived coherence across multiple rotational states simultaneously. As an example, we demonstrate simultaneous second-scale coherence between three rotational states. Utilising this extended coherence, we perform multiparameter estimation using a generalised Ramsey sequence and demonstrate coherent spin-1 dynamics encoded in the rotational states. With modest experimental improvements, we predict that second-scale coherent dynamics of ten rotational states should be readily achievable.

Title: Mixed-state geometric phases of coherent and squeezed spin states
Authors: Xin Wang, Jia-Chen Tang, Xu-Yang Hou, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: Two mixed-state geometric phases, known as the Uhlmann phase and interferometric geometric phase (IGP), of spin coherent states (CSSs) and spin squeezed states (SSSs) are analyzed. Exact solutions and numerical results of selected examples are presented. For the $j = 3/2$ CSS, the Uhlmann phase exhibits finite-temperature topological phase transitions characterized by abrupt jumps. The IGP for the same state similarly shows discontinuous jumps as the temperature varies. In the case of the $j = 1$ one-axis SSS, both Uhlmann phase and IGP display discrete finite-temperature jumps. By contrast, the $j = 1$ two-axis SSS shows no such transitions because the Uhlmann phase and IGP both vary smoothly with temperature. We also briefly discuss potential realizations and simulations related to these phenomena in spin systems.

Title: Why do financial prices exhibit Brownian motion despite predictable order flow?
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: In financial market microstructure, there are two enigmatic empirical laws: (i) the market-order flow has predictable persistence due to metaorder splitters by institutional investors, well formulated as the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model. However, this phenomenon seems paradoxical given the diffusive and unpredictable price dynamics; (ii) the price impact $I(Q)$ of a large metaorder $Q$ follows the square-root law, $I(Q)\propto \sqrt{Q}$. Here we theoretically reveal why price dynamics follows Brownian motion despite predictable order flow by unifying these enigmas. We generalize the Lillo-Mike-Farmer model to nonlinear price-impact dynamics, which is mapped to an exactly solvable Lévy-walk model. Our exact solution shows that the price dynamics remains diffusive under the square-root law, even under persistent order flow. This work illustrates the crucial role of the square-root law in mitigating large price movements by large metaorders, thereby leading to the Brownian price dynamics, consistently with the efficient market hypothesis over long timescales.

Title: Massive-Scale Simulations of 2D Ising and Blume-Capel Models on Rack-Scale Multi-GPU Systems
Authors: Mauro Bisson, Massimo Bernaschi, Massimiliano Fatica, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Isidoro González-Adalid Pemartín, Víctor Martín-Mayor, Alexandros Vasilopoulos
Abstract: We present high-performance implementations of the two-dimensional Ising and Blume-Capel models for large-scale, multi-GPU simulations. Our approach takes full advantage of the NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system, which features up to $72$ GPUs interconnected via high-bandwidth NVLink, enabling direct GPU-to-GPU memory access across multiple nodes. By utilizing Fabric Memory and an optimized Monte Carlo kernel for the Ising model, our implementation supports simulations of systems with linear sizes up to $L=2^{23}$, corresponding to approximately $70$ trillion spins. This allows for a peak processing rate of nearly $1.15 \times 10^5$ lattice updates per nanosecond-setting a new performance benchmark for Ising model simulations. Additionally, we introduce a custom protocol for computing correlation functions, which strikes an optimal balance between computational efficiency and statistical accuracy. This protocol enables large-scale simulations without incurring prohibitive runtime costs. Benchmark results show near-perfect strong and weak scaling up to $64$ GPUs, demonstrating the effectiveness of our approach for large-scale statistical physics simulations.

Title: Anomalous matrix product operator symmetries and 1D mixed-state phases
Authors: Xiao-Qi Sun
Abstract: The renormalization group for matrix product density operators (MPDOs) provides a powerful framework for describing one-dimensional mixed-state phases of matter and the renormalization fixed points (RFPs) are representative states for analyzing nontrivial phases. Recently, it was found that anomalous symmetries can provide a fundamental obstruction for certain short-range correlated mixed states to be efficiently prepared. In this work, we consider generalized symmetries including non-invertible ones realized microscopically as matrix product operators (MPOs), and study the physical implications of their quantum anomaly on the MPDO RFPs. We prove that MPDOs with strong anomalous MPO symmetries cannot be prepared from a normal matrix product state in the trivial phase via a translationally invariant finite-depth local quantum channel. We explicitly construct a general class of zero-correlation-length MPDO RFPs that exhibit strong anomalous MPO symmetries, and these MPDO RFPs form a distinct class from those that can be efficiently prepared as a consequence of quantum anomaly. Nonetheless, we further prove that all the constructed MPDO RFPs can be prepared from product states by finite-depth quantum circuit with measurements and feedforward.

Authors: Eyal Buks
Abstract: The current study is motivated by a difficulty to reconcile between particle number conservation and superconductivity. An alternative modeling, which is based on the hypothesis that disentanglement spontaneously ocuurs in quantum systems, is explored. The Fermi-Hubbard mode is employed to demonstrate a disentanglement-induced quantum phase transition into a state having a finite superconducting order parameter. Moreover, the effect of disentanglement on Josephson junction's current phase relation is explored.

Title: Where You Place the Norm Matters: From Prejudiced to Neutral Initializations
Authors: Emanuele Francazi, Francesco Pinto, Aurelien Lucchi, Marco Baity-Jesi
Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.
