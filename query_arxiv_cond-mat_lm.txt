Title: High Strain Rate Behavior of Liquid Crystal Elastomers
Authors: Adeline Wihardja, Juan Carlos Nieto Fuentes, Daniel Rittel, Kaushik Bhattacharya
Abstract: Liquid crystal elastomers are rubbery solids that couple liquid crystalline order and deformation. This coupling leads to properties that are attractive for a number of applications in soft robotics and energy absorption. This paper is motivated by the latter application, and provides a systematic experimental study of a particular class of liquid crystal elastomers -- the isotropic genesis polydomain liquid crystal elastomers -- over a wide range of strain rates. An important aspect of this study is a novel tensile drop-tower that enables tensile strain rates of 100 s$^{-1}$ that are important to application but previously inaccessible. The paper also extends a recently proposed constitutive model to the high strain rate regime, and shows that it can be fit to describe the observed behavior across the spectrum of examined behavior.

Title: Excitonic correlations in the system of gated metallic wires with the applied Zeeman magnetic field
Authors: V. Apinyan, T. Kopeć
Abstract: We have studied the electron-electron interactions in the system composed of two metallic wires, placed in the external magnetic and electric fields. The interactions between the electrons in the wires have been taken into account within the usual Hubbard model. We have considered both half-filling and partial-filling limits for the occupation of the atomic lattice sites. We show the existence of the excitonic pairing in this low-dimensional system and calculate the excitonic order parameter in different electron-electron interaction regime, magnetic field and temperature. We demonstrate that the usual Hubbard-$U$ interaction leads to strong electron localization which enhance the local antiferromagnetic order in the system.

Title: Canted antiferromagnetism and excitonic order in gated double-layer graphene
Authors: V. Apinyan, T. K. Kopeć
Abstract: We study the effects of the electron-electron interactions on the excitonic properties and charge-density modulations in the AB stacked double-layer (DL) graphene, placed in the external gate-potential $V$. The coexistence of the canted antiferromagnetic order and excitonic pairing gap has been studied with the help of the generalized Hubbard model. We calculate the chemical potential $\mu$, the average charge density difference between the layers $\delta{\bar{n}}$, the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and the excitonic order parameters $\Delta_{\sigma}$ in the zero temperature limit. We found that the excitonic pairing order parameter has a larger energy scale than the canted antiferromagnetic gap-function. The charge neutrality, in the DL graphene system, occurs only in the absence of the external gate-potential $V$. Moreover, we have shown that the values of the antiferromagnetic gap-function $\Delta_{\rm AFM}$ and excitonic order parameter $\Delta_{\sigma}$ are always increasing at the large values of inter-layer Coulomb interaction, while they are decreasing for large values of the applied gate-potential $V$.

Title: A unified picture of phonon anomalies in crystals and glasses
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: Phonon spectra in solids often display anomalies that defy the simple Debye law, most prominently the van Hove singularity in crystals and the boson peak in glasses. Although traditionally regarded as distinct, both features are increasingly recognized as sharing a common physical origin. In a recent work, G. Ding et al. (Nat. Phys. 2025) propose a resonant-damping model that unifies these anomalies within a single framework. By coupling phonon damping to vibrational softening, their theory explains why some materials exhibit van Hove peaks, others boson peaks, and many show both. This advance extends earlier ideas and theories of Baggioli and Zaccone on the competition between phonon propagation and damping, while also connecting to microscopic mechanisms such as nonaffine motions in glasses. The resonant-damping paradigm thus offers a promising step toward a unified understanding of vibrational anomalies across ordered and disordered solids.

Title: Temperley-Lieb integrable models and fusion categories
Authors: Matthew Blakeney, Luke Corcoran, Marius de Leeuw, Balazs Pozsgay, Eric Vernier
Abstract: We show that every fusion category containing a non-invertible, self-dual object $a$ gives rise to an integrable anyonic chain whose Hamiltonian density satisfies the Temperley-Lieb algebra. This spin chain arises by considering the projection onto the identity channel in the fusion process $a\otimes a$. We relate these models to Pasquier's construction of ADE lattice models. We then exploit the underlying Temperley-Lieb structure to discuss the spectrum of these models and argue that these models are gapped when the quantum dimension of $a$ is greater than 2. We show that for fusion categories where the dimension is close to 2, such as the Fib$\times$Fib and Haagerup fusion categories, the finite size effects are large and they can obscure the numerical analysis of the gap.

Title: Quantum Hall to Chiral Spin Liquid transition in a Triangular Lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard Model
Authors: Cesar A. Gallegos, Rafael M. Magaldi, Andrew Millis, Steven R. White
Abstract: We investigate the weak interaction integer quantum Hall (IQH) phase, the intermediate interaction phase identified as a chiral spin liquid (CSL) and the transition between them in the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at a density of one electron per site in an orbital magnetic field corresponding to one-quarter flux per plaquette. Our primary tool is the finite system density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method with both interaction-strength scan and fixed interaction techniques for cylinders of circumference 3, 5, and 7 and lengths up to 240. For the IQH phase, we use single particle exact diagonalization to clarify finite size effects, including an excess charge on the edges of our cylinders, and the limitations of entanglement spectra degeneracies on small circumference cylinders. For both phases, we use DMRG to study the entanglement spectra, the entanglement entropy, and the effect of flux insertion on charge and spin pumping, all of which show key differences between the two phases. To study the transition, we use interaction-strength scans extending between the two phases, and apply a scaling data collapse of a bond-dimerization order parameter to extract critical exponents. We also extract critical behavior from the divergence of correlation lengths on the IQH side, measuring decay away from edges of both the dimerization order parameter and transverse edge currents. The critical behavior and exponents are consistent with an Ising transition in 1+1 dimensions. Finally, we obtain excited states in various quantum number sectors finding that the gap to a charge neutral momentum $\pi$ excitation corresponding to fluctuations of the dimerization order parameter closes in the vicinity of the critical point but gaps to other excitations remain large.

Title: Coupled imbibition and evaporation of droplets deposited on a nanoporous layer
Authors: Joachim Trosseille, Hugo Bellezza, Olivier Vincent
Abstract: Liquids in hydrophilic pores of nanoscale dimensions have capillary pressures so large that they can theoretically climb several kilometers against gravity. But droplets deposited on thin nanoporous layers form imbibition fronts that stop advancing at typically a fraction of a millimeter, because of evaporation. Recently, there has been growing interest in such droplet infiltration dynamics, either as a way to study the behavior of confined fluids, or in connection with applications e.g. in water harvesting, printing, chemical delivery, actuating, sensing, etc. Here, we investigate theoretically and experimentally the spontaneous imbibition and evaporation of sessile liquid droplets into a thin porous layer with pores of nanometric dimensions (mesopores) and its dependency on the imposed relative humidity (RH). Theoretically, we provide a unified analytical approach to describe the dynamics of the imbibition annulus (halo), which corrects for a neglected coupling between imbibition and evaporation fluxes, describes halos of arbitrary dimensions with respect to droplet size, and incorporates confinement-induced thermodynamic shifts (Kelvin effect). Experimentally, we show that the timescales of halo formation diverge at a critical RH, due to the Kelvin effect. Our analysis also shows an apparent divergence of the imbibition coefficient, which cannot be explained by standard capillary models. This observation suggests an important role of vapor transport and condensation along the porous surface. Globally, our results indicate that droplet infiltration in porous layers involve complex couplings, and that one should be cautious when interpreting halo dynamics data. Our study also suggests RH as a powerful control parameter for tuning droplet imbibition behavior and infiltration patterns.

Title: Dimensionality-Changing Transition from a Non-Fermi Liquid to a Spin-Solid in a Multichannel Kondo Lattice
Authors: Simon Martin, Marcin Raczkowski, Fakher F. Assaad, Tarun Grover
Abstract: A multichannel Kondo system, where a single quantum spin couples to multiple channels of an electronic bath, provides one of the simplest examples of a zero-dimensional non-Fermi liquid. It is natural to ask: what happens when an extensive number of such systems are coupled together? A simple renormalization group argument implies that in a chain of SU(N) multichannel quantum systems, where each spin is coupled to its own bath of K channels, the individual spins dynamically decouple at low energy when N>K, resulting in a 'sliding' non-Fermi liquid. Using Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, we find evidences of a continuous, 'dimensionality-changing' phase transition out of this non-Fermi liquid into a valence-bond solid phase as the intersite coupling is increased. Remarkably, at the critical point, correlations exhibit a power-law behavior even along the direction in which the spins are coupled, indicating the breakdown of dynamical decoupling at the transition. We also develop an RG scheme to understand the universal aspects of this transition.

Title: Quantum geometry and impurity sensitivity of superconductors without time-reversal symmetry: application to rhombohedral graphene and altermagnets
Authors: Denis Sedov, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: Analyzing the consequences of the quantum geometry induced by the momentum dependence of Bloch states has emerged as a very rich and active field in condensed matter physics. For instance, for the superfluid stiffness or the pairing mechanism, these geometric aspects can play an important role. We here demonstrate that quantum geometry can also be essential for the disorder sensitivity of a superconductor, in particular when time-reversal symmetry is broken in the normal-state Bloch Hamiltonian. We derive a general expression for the behavior of the critical temperature $T_c$ involving weighted (anti-)commutators of the superconducting order parameter and impurity matrix elements, which includes both wave-function effects and kinetic pair breaking due to broken time-reversal symmetry in the dispersion. We analyze how the former effects lead to "quantum geometric pair breaking", where any superconductor becomes susceptible to microscopically non-magnetic impurities, and formally relate it to the maximum possible localization of two-particle Wannier states. Further, in the presence of kinetic pair breaking, impurities can also enhance pairing, leading to an overall more complex, non-monotonic behavior of $T_c$ with impurity concentration. We also analyze the fate of finite-momentum pairing. Our results are directly relevant to rhombohedral graphene, twisted MoTe$_2$, and superconducting altermagnets.

Title: Approach to equilibrium for a particle interacting with a harmonic thermal bath
Authors: Federico Bonetto, Alberto Mario Maiocchi
Abstract: We study the long time evolution of the position-position correlation function $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ for a harmonic oscillator (the {\it probe}) interacting via a coupling $\alpha$ with a large chain of $N$ coupled oscillators (the {\it heat bath}). At $t=0$ the probe and the bath are in equilibrium at temperature $T_P$ and $T_B$, respectively. We show that for times $t$ and $s$ of the order of $N$, $C_{\alpha,N}(s,t)$ is very well approximated by its limit $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ as $N\to\infty$. We find that, if the frequency $\Omega$ of the probe is in the spectrum of the bath, the system appears to thermalize, at least at higher order in $\alpha$. This means that, at order 0 in $\alpha$, $C_\alpha(s,t)$ equals the correlation of a probe in contact with an ideal stochastic {\it thermostat}, that is forced by a white noise and subject to dissipation. In particular we find that $\lim_{t\to\infty} C_\alpha(t,t)=T_B/\Omega^2$ while that $\lim_{\tau\to\infty} C_\alpha(\tau,\tau+t)$ exists and decays exponentially in $t$. Notwithstanding this, at higher order in $\alpha$, $C_{\alpha}(s,t)$ contains terms that oscillate or vanish as a power law in $|t-s|$. That is, even when the bath is very large, it cannot be thought of as a stochastic thermostat. When the frequency of the bath is far from the spectrum of the bath, no thermalization is observed.

Title: Quantum localization in incommensurate tight-binding chains
Authors: C. J. Dyrseth, K. V. Samokhin
Abstract: We explore quantum localization phenomena in a system of two coupled tight-binding chains with incommensurate periods. Employing the inverse participation ratio as a measure of localization, we investigate the effects of geometric incommensurability and external magnetic fields. Numerical results reveal the existence of a mobility edge in the spectrum characterized by an abrupt onset of localization in higher-energy states. We find that localization tends to be enhanced by a weak magnetic field, whereas a strong field delocalizes most states.

Title: Dynamics of Majorana Fermions on a Quantum Computer
Authors: Yuxiao Hang, Rosa Di Felice, Aiichiro Nakano, Stephan Haas
Abstract: The study of quasiparticle dynamics is central to understanding non-equilibrium phenomena in quantum many-body systems. Direct simulation of such dynamics on quantum hardware has been limited by circuit depth and noise constraints. In this work, we use a recently developed constant-depth circuit algorithm to examine the real-time evolution of site-resolved magnetization in a transverse-field Ising chain on noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices. By representing each spin as a pair of Majorana fermions, we identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the relative strength of spin interaction. Furthermore, we show how local impurities can serve as probes of Majorana modes, acting as dynamical barriers in the weak coupling regime. These results demonstrate that constant-depth quantum circuits provide a viable route for studying quasiparticle propagation and for probing Majorana signatures on currently available quantum processors.

Title: Defect configuration of an active nematic around a circular obstacle
Authors: Hiroki Matsukiyo, Jun-ichi Fukuda
Abstract: Nematic liquid crystal is a complex fluid whose constituents have an anisotropic shape and exhibit orientational order. A class of active matter which exhibits orientational order, e.g., cell populations, is called active nematic. A singularity of the orientational field, called a topological defect, is a robust structure which cannot be removed by continuum deformations. This robustness plays an important role in, e.g., the process of morphogenesis. To enhance the understanding of the behavior of active nematic, it is important to understand the behavior of topological defects. In this paper, we study the configuration of topological defects of a two-dimensional active nematic around a circular obstacle. In the case of a passive nematic liquid crystal, the equilibrium configuration of defects can be easily identified by the method of image charges. In the case of an active nematic, however, one must take account of the flow field generated by active constituents, and the problem of identifying the defect configuration becomes complicated. In this study, we perform numerical simulations and investigate how the stationary defect configuration deviates from the passive case. Furthermore, we carry out a theoretical calculation based on an analytical expression relating the defect velocity with the force exerted on the defect. Our theoretical calculation qualitatively reproduces the simulation results. Our study may be applied to describing the behaviour of e.g. cell populations in the presence of obstacles, and has the potential to benefit related fields, e.g., developmental biology.

Title: Correlation between magnetism and lattice dynamics for cubic FeGe under pressure
Authors: R.A. Tonacatl-Monez, R. Heid, O. De la Peña-Seaman
Abstract: This first-principles study investigates the structural, electronic, lattice dynamical properties, and electron-phonon coupling in ferromagnetic cubic B20 FeGe under applied pressure. The implemented spin-scaling exchange-correlation (ssxc) approach allowed to modify the magnetic moment and ferromagnetic phase energetics using a single scaling parameter, thereby yielding an adjustment of the critical pressure ($p_c$) to its experimental value. The ssxc scheme resulted in a subtle energy shift of the electronic bands in the spin-up channel, and reduced the magnetic moment, bringing it closer to the experimentally reported value. Application of the ssxc approach to phonon dispersion and electron-phonon interaction resulted in a slight mitigation of the pronounced softening and large linewidths of the lowest-frequency acoustic branch close to the $R$-point, typically observed with standard DFT calculations. With increasing pressure, phonon anomaly and linewidths diminish significantly and practically disappear at $p_c$ and beyond. This trend parallels the pressure dependence of the magnetic moment. A comparative analysis of the electronic joint density of states with the phonon linewidths revealed that the momentum dependence of linewidths around the $R$-point closely follow the momentum dependence of the electron-phonon matrix elements. This indicates that the correlation between magnetic moment and linewidths under applied pressure originates from the electron-phonon matrix elements, presenting a distinct scenario compared to other B20 family members, where nesting plays a more dominating role.

Title: Fabrication and Structural Analysis of Trilayers for Tantalum Josephson Junctions with Ta$_2$O$_5$ Barriers
Authors: Raahul Potluri, Rohin Tangirala, Sage Bauers, Alejandro Barrios, Praveen Kumar, Peter V. Sushko, David P. Pappas, Serena Eley
Abstract: Tantalum (Ta) has recently emerged as a promising low-loss material, enabling record coherence times in superconducting qubits. This enhanced performance is largely attributed to its stable native oxide, which is believed to host fewer two-level system (TLS) defects key $-$ contributors to decoherence in superconducting circuits. Nevertheless, aluminum oxide (AlO$_x$) remains the predominant choice for Josephson junction barriers in most qubit architectures. In this study, we systematically investigate various techniques for forming high-quality oxide layers on $\alpha$-phase tantalum ($\alpha$-Ta) thin films, aiming to develop effective Josephson junction barriers. We explore thermal oxidation in a tube furnace, rapid thermal annealing, as well as plasma oxidation of both room-temperature and heated Ta films, and propose a mechanistic picture of the underlying oxidation mechanisms. All methods yield Ta$_2$O$_5$, the same compound as tantalum's native oxide. Among these, plasma oxidation produces the smoothest and highest-quality oxide layers, making it particularly well-suited for Josephson junction fabrication. Furthermore, we demonstrate the successful epitaxial growth of $\alpha$-Ta atop oxidized $\alpha$-Ta films, paving the way for the realization of trilayer Ta/Ta-O/Ta Josephson junctions with clean, low-loss interfaces.

Title: Circuit-based cavity magnonics in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes
Authors: Takahiro Chiba, Ryunosuke Suzuki, Takashi Otaki, Hiroaki Matsueda
Abstract: We theoretically study nonperturbative strong-coupling phenomena in cavity magnonics systems in which the uniform magnetization dynamics (magnons) in a ferromagnet is coupled to the microwave magnetic field (photons) of a single LC resonator. Starting from an effective circuit model that accounts for the magnetization dynamics described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation, we show that a nontrivial frequency shift emerges in the ultrastrong and deep-strong coupling regimes, whose microscopic origin remains elusive within a purely classical framework. The circuit model is further quantized to derive a minimal quantum mechanical model for generic cavity magnonics, which corresponds to a two-mode version of the Hopfield Hamiltonian and explains the mechanism of the frequency shifts found in the {\it classical} circuit model. We also formulate the relation between the frequency shift and quantum quantities, such as the ground-state particle number, quantum fluctuations associated with the Heisenberg uncertainty principle, and entanglement entropy, providing a nondestructive means to experimentally access to these quantum resources. By utilizing soft magnons in an anisotropic ferromagnet, we further demonstrate that these quantum quantities diverge at the zeros of the magnon band edges as a function of the external magnetic field. This work paves the way for cavity magnonics beyond the conventional strong coupling regime.

Title: Good Enough is Better: Feasibility vs. Pareto-Optimality in Alloy Design
Authors: Cayden Maguire, Christofer Hardcastle, Trevor Hastings, Raymundo Arróyave, Brent Vela
Abstract: In alloy design, the search for candidate materials is often framed as an optimization problem, with the goal of identifying Pareto-optimal solutions across multiple objectives. However, Pareto-optimal solutions do not necessarily satisfy all minimum performance thresholds required for practical deployment. An alternative approach is to treat alloy design as a constraint satisfaction problem, in which the goal is to identify any solution that meets all bare minimum requirements across multiple quantities of interest. These approaches have yet to be benchmarked against each other in the context of realistic alloy design problems. In this work, we demonstrate that, in realistic alloy design campaigns involving multiple objectives and constraints, the constraint satisfaction framework yields a higher likelihood of finding viable alloys than optimization-based approaches. Furthermore, constraint-satisfaction approaches find the first viable alloy solutions earlier than optimization. Our results suggest that focusing on feasibility rather than optimality can lead to more actionable outcomes in materials discovery, particularly in highly constrained applications.

Title: Intrinsic Non-linearity of Josephson Junctions as an Alternative Origin of the Missing First Shapiro Step
Authors: Lei Xu, Shuhang Mai, Manzhang Xu, Xue Yang, Lihong Hu, Xinyi Zheng, Sicheng Zhou, Siyuan Zhou, Bingbing Tong, Xiaohui Song, Jie Shen, Zhaozheng Lyu, Ziwei Dou, Xiunian Jing, Fanming Qu, Peiling Li, Guangtong Liu, Li Lu
Abstract: The missing first Shapiro step in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions has been widely interpreted as a hallmark of Majorana bound states. However, conventional mechanisms like junction underdamping or Joule heating can produce similar signatures. Here, we demonstrate that the intrinsic non-linear current-voltage characteristic of low-to-moderate transparency junctions can also suppress the first step, accompanied by distinctive zigzag boundaries between the zeroth and first step at intermediate driving frequencies. Microwave measurements on Al/WTe2 junctions and numerical simulations of a non-linear resistively and capacitively shunted junction model reveal the first step collapse induced by switching jumps of current, together with zigzag features absent in scenarios solely driven by finite \b{eta} or Joule heating. This zigzag signature therefore provides a crucial diagnostic tool, emphasizing the necessity of comprehensive analysis of microwave spectra before attributing the absence of the first Shapiro step to Majorana physics.

Title: Domain wall induced topological Hall effect in the chiral-lattice ferromagnet Fe$_x$TaS$_2$
Authors: Sk Jamaluddin, Warit Nisaiyok, Yu Zhang, Hari Bhandari, Brian A. Francisco, Peter E. Siegfried, Fehmi Sami Yasin, Tianyi Wang, Abhijeet Nayak, Mohamed El Gazzah, Resham Babu Regmi, June Ho Yeo, Liuyan Zhao, J. F. Mitchell, Yong-Tao Cui, Nirmal J. Ghimire
Abstract: Magnetic topology and its associated emergent phenomena are central to realizing intriguing quantum states and spintronics functionalities. Designing spin textures to achieve strong and distinct electrical responses remains a significant challenge. Layered transition metal dichalcogenides offer a versatile platform for tailoring structural and magnetic properties, enabling access to a wide spectrum of topological magnetic states. Here, we report a domain-wall-driven, large, and tunable topological Hall effect (THE) in a non-centrosymmetric intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides series Fe$_x$TaS$_2$. By systematically varying the Fe intercalation level, we exert precise control over the magnetic ground states, allowing manipulation of the topological Hall effect. Real-space magnetic force microscopy (MFM) provides direct evidence of periodic magnetic stripe domain formation, confirming the microscopic origin of the observed topological transport phenomena. Our findings establish a promising way for tuning the topology of domains to generate substantial electromagnetic responses in layered magnetic materials.

Title: Kondo breakdown induced by the non-Hermitian complex hybridization
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Masaya Nakagawa, Norio Kawakami
Abstract: Recently, a non-Hermitian Anderson impurity model with one-body loss has been studied in [Phys. Rev. B 111, 125157 (2025)}], and it has been demonstrated that the renormalization effect generated by strong correlations counterintuitively changes the nature of dissipation into an emergent many-body dissipation that causes a Kondo breakdown. In a closely related context, it is also known that two-body loss in a non-Hermitian Kondo model triggers the Kondo breakdown. To elucidate the essence of these phenomena, we study the Anderson impurity model with a non-Hermitian complex hybridization as an effective model that provides a simple understanding of the Kondo breakdown. Using the slave-boson mean-field theory, we show that this model can explain the Kondo breakdown with a single complex parameter. Furthermore, we provide the exact Bethe ansatz solutions that support the results obtained by the slave-boson mean-field theory. Finally, we point out that the Lehmann representation for the non-Hermitian Green function cannot be obtained by the analytic continuation to the complex energy upon the Kondo breakdown, where the analyticity of the non-Hermitian Green function in the half-complex-$\omega$ plane no longer holds.

Title: Microscopic evidence of a field-induced critical spin-liquid state in a frustrated metal
Authors: I. Ishant, Z. Guguchia, V. Fritsch, O. Stockert, M. Majumder
Abstract: A field-induced quantum spin liquid (QSL) state is an extraordinary phenomenon, hitherto unobserved in metallic frustrated compounds. Recent bulk measurements have revealed intriguing field-induced magnetic states in metallic frustrated CePdAl. However, the nature of these field-induced states, potentially including a QSL state, remains unclear due to the lack of detailed microscopic investigation. To elucidate these field-induced states, we employed the transverse-field muon spin relaxation/rotation (TF-$\mu$SR) technique, applying various magnetic fields parallel to the c-axis in single-crystalline CePdAl over a broad temperature range (100~K-100~mK). Our $\mu$SR data indicate that field-induced low-temperature states for fields B$\leq B_{c2}(=3.4~T)$ exhibit long-range magnetic order, whereas for B>$B_{c2}$ they yield contrasting behavior. Notably, at 3.75 T, the transverse relaxation rate ($\lambda_T$) diverges following a power-law dependence below 800~mK along with an indication of finite frustration, whereas the Knight shift is temperature independent. These observations corroborate the signature of a critical spin-liquid (CSL) with antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations. Furthermore, at 4.3 T, a non-Fermi liquid state is observed where frustration is absent. This comprehensive microscopic study strongly suggests the existence of a CSL state in a metallic frustrated system.

Title: Soft Phonon Charge-Density Wave Formation in the Kagome Metal KV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Yifan Wang, Chenchao Xu, Zhimian Wu, Huachen Rao, Zhaoyang Shan, Yi Liu, Guanghan Cao, Michael Smidman, Ming Shi, Huiqiu Yuan, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen, Chao Cao, Yu Song
Abstract: A range of of unusual emergent behaviors have been reported in the charge-density wave (CDW) state of the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A=~$K, Rb, Cs) kagome metals, including a CDW formation process without soft phonons, which points to an unconventional CDW mechanism. Here, we use inelastic x-ray scattering to show that the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$ forms via phonons that soften to zero energy at the CDW ordering vector ($L$-point) around $T_{\rm CDW}=78$~K. These soft phonons exhibit a remarkable in-plane anisotropy, extending over a much larger momentum range along $L$-$A$ relative to $L$-$H$, which leads to diffuse scattering common among $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$. Using first-principles calculations, we find that the momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is peaked at $L$ and exhibits the same in-plane anisotropy as the phonon softening. Conversely, the electronic susceptibility is not peaked at $L$ and shows the opposite in-plane anisotropy. Our findings favor momentum-dependent EPC as the driving mechanism of the CDW in KV$_3$Sb$_5$, with a CDW formation process similar to that of transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Electric field induced Berry curvature dipole and non-linear anomalous Hall effect in higher wave symmetric unconventional magnets
Authors: Srimayi Korrapati, Snehasish Nandy, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: We investigate the second-order anomalous Hall response in two-dimensional higher-wave-symmetric magnets, including the recently discovered class of collinear magnets known as altermagnets, when subjected to a symmetry-breaking external electric field. In these systems, the first- and second-order anomalous Hall responses mediated by the first- and second-order multipoles of the Berry curvature over the occupied states vanish by symmetry. However, a symmetry-breaking dc electric field can induce a nonzero Berry curvature dipole by coupling to a nonvanishing quantum metric, also known as the Berry connection polarizability. An applied ac electric field can then generate a finite nonlinear transverse Hall effect characterized by a second harmonic response. We discuss this remarkable effect in a class of higher-order-symmetric unconventional magnets (of $p$, $d$, $f$, $g$, $i$ symmetry), including the subclass of altermagnets. We demonstrate that the electric-field-induced anomalous Hall effect in the higher-wave-symmetric magnets can serve not only as a probe of the underlying quantum metric of the occupied states but also as a means to distinguish the even ($d$-,$g$-wave) and odd ($p$-wave) order parameter symmetries defined on the square lattice.

Title: Non-relativistic spin splitting: Features and Functionalities
Authors: Sayantika Bhowal, Arnab Bose
Abstract: Recently, spin splitting of non-relativistic origin in compensated antiferromagnets has drawn growing attention in condensed matter research. Although many materials, now known to exhibit such spin splitting, have been studied for decades, their manifestation along non-high-symmetry momentum directions initially hindered their recognition. In recent years, significant progress has been made in uncovering the symmetry principles that allow non-relativistic spin splitting in the absence of net magnetization, revealing the unconventional physics arising from their coexistence. In this review, we provide a concise overview of non-relativistic spin splitting in compensated antiferromagnets with various spin configurations, including collinear, coplanar, and non-coplanar spin arrangements. We summarize practical identification guidelines, highlight characteristic features in electronic band structures, and discuss the emerging functionalities, with an emphasis on promising directions for future exploration.

Title: Emergent Massless Dirac Fermions in Moiré Bands of Bilayer Graphene/hBN Superlattice
Authors: Mohit Kumar Jat, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aveek bid
Abstract: A superlattice of multilayer graphene and hBN has proven to be a promising pathway for engineering electronic band structures and topologies. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate the role of hBN alignment in inducing topological band reconstruction in bilayer graphene (BLG) superlattices. Our study establishes that while the primary band retains its massive chiral naure, the secondary bands host massless, chiral fermions. Magnetotransport measurements, including Quantum Hall, temperature-dependent Shubnikov-de Haas oscillations, and Berry phase analysis, confirm the distinct topological nature of these bands. A significantly reduced Fermi velocity in the moiré secondary band indicates band flattening induced by the moiré potential. Our study provides a pathway for controlling topological quantum transport in BLG/hBN superlattices.

Title: Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain
Authors: Kazuhiro Kuboki
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

Title: Temporal Renormalization and the Critical-like Behavior in Supercooled Liquids
Authors: D. M. Zhang, D. Y. Sun, X. G. Gong
Abstract: Inspired by the Kadanoff transformation in the standard renormalization group theory, we propose a temporal renormalization scheme. A Boltzmann factor that explicitly depends on the renormalized timescale is constructed, permitting thermodynamic quantities to be evaluated self-consistently across different timescales. By applying the scheme to the long-time dynamics of supercooled liquids, we uncover critical-like behaviors of supercooled liquid with three characteristic renormalization timescales: At the first timescale s_{\alpha}, the system appears to be "thermodynamically frozen", i.e., the energy fluctuation becomes temperature-independent throughout the supercooled regime. At the second timescale s_{\beta}, the third-order moment of energy distribution reaches a maximum, and s_{\beta} is nearly temperature-independent. At the third timescale s_{\gamma}, the third-order moment of energy distribution passes through a minimum, and s_{\gamma} diverges as a power law s_{\gamma}=(T-T_{c})^(-{\gamma}). The scaling relations may reveal an intrinsic behavior in supercooled liquids, highlighting their unique feature. The current findings also demonstrate that temporal renormalization provides a powerful lens for investigating the timescale-specific dynamics.

Title: Highly Rectifying Cubic Copper Iron Sulfides p-n Junction Diode Fabricated by Anodic Oxidation
Authors: Yoshimine Kato, Tomoaki Nakamura, Katsuya Komorita, Kungen Teii
Abstract: Rectification properties of semiconductor p-n junction diodes are the basic and important characteristics for electronic device evaluation, especially for novel semiconductor materials. Today's semiconductor devices' fabrication and integration processes require multibillion-dollar investments and are desired to be reduced or simplified. Therefore, low-cost and non-toxic base metal materials with simple fabrication methods are desired for the future semiconductor industry. Recently, copper-based sulfides have been studied for semiconductor devices such as thermoelectric, photovoltaic, or water-splitting applications. Here, a highly rectifying p-n diode of a cubic (disordered) phase Cu4Fe5S8 polycrystal with a zincblende-like structure fabricated by a simple/low-cost wet process is shown. It is found that the Cu4Fe5S8 diode shows the highest rectification ratio in the order of 106 with a large forward current density of 15 Acm-2 (@1.5 V forward bias) at room temperature among the other compounds of copper iron sulfide devices. This remarkable and stable diode characteristic obtained by the p-type layer anodically grown on the sintered n-type cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 can bring the industry closer to low-cost semiconductor manufacturing. These results open a platform of novel semiconductor materials such as cubic-Cu4Fe5S8 with further superior crystal growth and conductive characteristics.

Title: Nonergodic extended phase for waves in three dimensions
Authors: Marcus Prado, Romain Bachelard, Robin Kaiser, Felipe A. Pinheiro
Abstract: Wave transport in complex media is determined by the nature of quasimodes at the microscopic level. In three dimensional disordered media, waves generally undergo a phase transition from diffusion to Anderson localization, characterized by exponentially localized modes. A remarkable exception are electromagnetic waves, whose vector-like nature prevents Anderson localization to occur. Here we demonstrate that both scalar and vector (electromagnetic) waves exhibit a non-ergodic extended phase characterized by fractal quasimodes, for a broad range of disorder strengths. While electromagnetic waves remain in the non-ergodic extended phase at high disorder strength, scalar waves eventually enter a localized regime. These results pave the way for the engineering of anomalous wave transport phenomena in disordered media without spatial correlations.

Title: Critical fluctuations and conserved dynamics in a strange ferromagnetic metal
Authors: Jin Zhan, Yongjun Zhang, Jiawen Zhang, Yu Liu, Zhiyong Nie, Yuxin Chen, Lin Jiao, Yashar Komijani, Michael Smidman, Frank Steglich, Piers Coleman, Huiqiu Yuan
Abstract: The origin of the strange metallic behavior observed in a wide range of quantum materials is an open challenge to condensed matter physics. Historically, strange metals were uniquely associated with antiferromagnetic quantum critical points (QCPs), but a new generation of materials reveals their association with uniform order parameters, such as ferromagnetism, valley or nematic order, suggesting a deeper common denominator. At a QCP, order parameter fluctuations are characterized by the dynamical critical exponent $z$, which quantifies the space-time scaling asymmetry. Here, we report the observation of a divergence in the Grüneisen ratio at the QCP of the strange-metal ferromagnet CeRh$_6$Ge$_4$ with a dynamical critical exponent $z=3$, signaling that the underlying quantum singularity involves a conserved degree of freedom. Yet the magnetization of this easy-plane ferromagnet is not conserved. We argue that the $z=3$ strange criticality requires a description beyond the Landau paradigm, proposing a link with the gauge modes of the small-to-large Fermi surface transition and the associated gauge charge of the delocalizing heavy electrons.

Title: Self-diffusion in confined systems
Authors: Manuel Mayo, María Isabel García de Soria, Pablo Maynar, José Javier Brey
Abstract: The self-diffusion process of a hard sphere fluid confined by two parallel plates separated by a distance on the order of the particle diameter is studied. The starting point is a closed kinetic equation for the distribution function that takes into account the effects of the confinement and that is valid in the low-density limit. From it, the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation that describes the dynamics of some tagged particles when the whole system is in equilibrium is derived. An equation that describes the diffusion in the directions parallel to the walls is deduced by applying the Zwanzig-Mori projection technique to the Boltzmann-Lorentz equation, obtaining an explicit expression for the self-diffusion coefficient that depends on the height of the system. A very good agreement between its theoretical prediction and Molecular Dynamics simulation results is obtained for the whole range of heights.

Title: Predictive Indicator of Critical Point in Equilibrium and Nonequilibrium Magnetic Systems
Authors: Tianyi Zhang, Caihua Wan, Xiufeng Han
Abstract: Determining critical points of phase transitions from partial data is essential to avoid abrupt system collapses and reducing experimental or computational costs. However, the complex physical systems and phase transition phenomena have long hindered the development of unified approaches applicable to both equilibrium and nonequilibrium phase transitions. In this work, we propose predictive indicators to determine critical points in equilibrium and nonequilibrium magnetic systems based on frequency-dependent response function. For equilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching under magnetic field, the static magnetization response function to a perturbing magnetic field diverges at the critical field, serving as a noise-resilient predictive indicator that also reflects the transition order and critical exponents. In contrast, for nonequilibrium phase transition, such as magnetization switching driven by spin-transfer torque, static response fails to signal criticality. Instead, the dynamic response at ferromagnetic resonance frequency diverges at the critical point, which is also robust against thermal noise. We further demonstrate that these static and dynamic indicators can be unified in the frame of first-order linear differential systems, offering a generalizable strategy for predicting criticality in both equilibrium and nonequilibrium transitions.

Title: Polymorphic self-poisoning in poly(lactic acid): a new phenomenon in polymer crystallization
Authors: Shu-Gui Yang, Xiang-bing Zeng, Feng Liu, Goran Ungar
Abstract: Self-poisoning (SP) is ubiquitous in polymer crystallization, but has so far manifested itself visibly only as minima in growth rate vs. temperature in either monodisperse systems where e.g. unstable folded chains obstruct crystallization of stable extended chains, or in periodically segmented chains where unstable stems with n-1 segments disturb deposition of stable stems with n segments. Here we report a new type of self-poisoning found in poly(lactic acid) (PLA), where a less stable crystal form (alpha') disturbs growth of the stable form (alpha). While alpha requires strict up-down order of the polar chains, alpha' does not, hence is kinetically favoured. Unexpectedly, below the temperature of the growth rate minimum the lamellar thickness increases rather than drops, as in all other reported cases of polymer crystallization with decreasing temperature. A growth rate equation model is developed, giving good match with experiments, but revealing an unexpectedly low fold surface free energy of alpha' form. Due to SP of alpha, most practical fast-cooling processing gives the low-modulus alpha'-form grown close to Tg, explaining generally poor mechanical properties of the bio-friendly PLA.

Title: Unlock Anionic Behavior of Calcium Through Pressure Engineering
Authors: Yang Lv, Junwei Li, Jianfu Li, Yong Liu, Jianan Yuan, 1 Jiani Lin, Saori Kawaguchi-Imada, Qingyang Hu, Xiaoli Wang
Abstract: An isolated calcium (Ca) atom has empty d-orbitals under ambient conditions. However, s-d band hybridization has been observed in both elemental Ca and compounds by manipulating thermodynamic conditions. Here, we reveal that the Ca 3d-band can even capture electrons from halogen atoms under pressure, exhibiting anionic behaviors in iodides. We predict a CsCl-type monovalent CaI at above 50 GPa by employing first-principles structural searching and successfully identified the phase at 84 GPa using in situ X-ray diffraction. We further reveal that, due to the effect of orbital broadening, unusual charge transfer from the 5p orbitals of I to the 3d orbitals of Ca in CaI, gradually reverses the ionicity of Ca and becomes the anionic ICa at 485 GPa. Multivalent Ca stabilizes a set of metallic iodides with eight- to ten-fold iodine hyper-coordination. Our findings demonstrate that the valence states of Ca can vary from negative to +2, suggesting much greater complexity of Ca chemistry under ultrahigh pressures.

Title: Thermoelectric properties of interacting double quantum dots
Authors: Nahual Sobrino
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric transport properties of an interacting parallel double quantum dot in the Coulomb-blockade regime. Building on an analytical solution based on an equation-of-motion technique, we extend the formalism for the asymmetrically coupled situation and provide compact closed-form expressions for steady-state currents together with the differential conductance, Seebeck coefficient, and thermal conductance. We determine the operating points that maximize efficiency and output power of the system, clarifying their relation to standard near-equilibrium ZT expressions. We further study the thermal rectification in both the open- and closed-circuit configurations and derive an expression for the open-circuit case. Interaction-induced resonances are understood in terms of the poles of the resulting Green's function, generating gate and bias dependent regions of enhanced efficiency at finite power, negative differential thermal conductance, and finite thermal rectification.

Title: PBr3 Adsorption and Dissociation on the Si(100) Surface
Authors: Vladimir M. Shevlyuga, Yulia A. Vorontsova, Tatiana V. Pavlova
Abstract: The adsorption of PBr3 on the Si(100)-2$\times$1 surface was studied by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and density functional theory (DFT). The PBr3 molecule completely dissociates on the Si(100) surface at room temperature into P and Br atoms. In most cases, the dissociated molecule was observed in STM on three neighboring Si dimers. DFT calculations confirm that the PBr3 molecule can completely dissociate at room temperature. After annealing the sample to 400$^{\circ}$C, phosphorus is incorporated into silicon, as evidenced by the Si atoms ejected to the surface. These findings are useful for the insertion of individual phosphorus atoms into silicon by PBr3 adsorption through a halogen mask.

Title: Vacancy diffusion on a brominated Si(100) surface: Critical effect of the dangling bond charge state
Authors: T. V. Pavlova, V. M. Shevlyuga
Abstract: Silicon dangling bonds (DBs) on an adsorbate-covered Si(100) surface can be created in a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) with high precision required for a number of applications. However, vacancies containing DBs can diffuse, disrupting precisely created structures. In this work, we study the diffusion of Br vacancies on a Si(100)-2$\times$1-Br surface in an STM under typical imaging conditions. In agreement with previous work, Br vacancies diffuse at a positive sample bias voltage. Here, we demonstrated that only vacancies containing a positively charged DB hop across the two atoms of a single Si dimer, while vacancies containing neutral and negatively charged DBs do not. Calculations based on the density functional theory confirmed that positively charged Br (and Cl) vacancies have a minimum activation barrier. We propose that diffusion operates by both one-electron and two-electron mechanisms depending on the applied voltage. Our results show that the DB charge has a critical effect on the vacancy diffusion. This effect should be taken into account when imaging surface structures with charged DBs, as well as when studying the diffusion of other atoms and molecules on the Si(100) surface with vacancies in an adsorbate layer.

Title: Ultralow-Cost magnetocaloric compound for Cryogenic Cooling
Authors: Wei Liu, Benjamin Theisel, Yulia Klunnikova, Konstantin Skokov, Oliver Gutfleisch
Abstract: Cost-effective materials are essential for large-scale deployment. The emerging magnetocaloric hydrogen liquefaction technology could transform the liquid hydrogen industry due to its potential in achieving higher efficiency. Most studies of the cryogenic magnetocaloric effect (MCE) have focused on resource-critical rare-earth-based compounds. Here we report on an ionic magnetocaloric compound FeCl$_2$ which is based on ultralow-cost elements, as a candidate working material for hydrogen liquefaction. FeCl$_2$ shows both inverse and conventional MCE. From 0 to 1.5 T, the inverse effect yields a positive magnetic entropy change ($\Delta S_T$) of about 5 J/kg/K near 20 K, then declines toward zero at higher fields. In contrast, the conventional (negative) response strengthens with field. The $\Delta S_T$ reaches 18.6 J/kg/K near 20 K in magnetic fields of 5 T. This value exceeds most light rare-earth-based compounds and approaches that of heavy rare-earth-based compounds. In magnetic fields of 5 T, the adiabatic temperature change reaches about 3.6 K. The large $\Delta S_T$, along with the low cost of the elements in FeCl$_2$, are prerequisites for inexpensive industrial-scale production, giving the prospect of a practical magnetocaloric candidate for hydrogen liquefaction in the 20 $\sim$ 77 K temperature window.

Title: Metallic island array as synthetic quantum matter: fractionalized entropy and thermal transport
Authors: Nitay Hurvitz, Gleb Finkelstein, Eran Sela
Abstract: The surprisingly rich physics of a single Coulomb-blockaded metallic island, when coupled to quantum Hall edge channels, is now well established -- giving rise to charge fractionalization and multi-channel quantum impurity behavior. Here, we show that qualitatively new physics emerges in arrays of such elements. We consider a 1D chain of $N$ metallic islands, focusing on thermodynamic signatures such as quantized entropy and anomalous thermal conductance. Universal and robust behavior emerges for energy scales smaller than the charging energy of the islands. In particular, we demonstrate that for the bulk filling factor of $\nu=1$, the islands could support a finite heat flow without temperature difference between them. Upon pinching the array with a quantum point contact, we predict an entropy change that scales with the number of islands as $\Delta S = \frac{1}{2}k_B \log (N+1)$, which can be measured using charge detection. This fractional entropy suggests the emergence of a novel type of excitations in the array.

Title: Transitions between liquid crystalline phases investigated by dielectric and infra-red spectroscopies
Authors: Aleksandra Deptuch, Natalia Osiecka-Drewniak, Anna Paliga, Natalia Górska, Anna Drzewicz, Katarzyna Chat, Mirosława D. Ossowska-Chruściel, Janusz Chruściel
Abstract: The liquid crystalline 11OS5 compound, forming the nematic phase and a few smectic phases, is investigated by broadband dielectric spectroscopy and infra-red spectroscopy. The dielectric relaxation times, ionic conductivity, and positions of infra-red absorption bands corresponding to selected intra-molecular vibrations are determined as a function of temperature in the range from isotropic liquid to a crystal phase. The correlation coefficient matrix and k-means cluster analysis of infra-red spectra are tested for detection of phase transitions. The density-functional theory calculations are carried out for interpretation of experimental infra-red spectra. The performance of various basis sets and exchange-correlation functionals is compared, including both agreement of scaled calculated band positions with experimental values and computational time. The inter-molecular interactions in the crystal phase are inferred from the experimental IR spectra and density-functional theory calculations for dimers in head-to-head and head-to-tail configurations. The experimental temperature dependence of the C=O stretching band suggests that the head-to-tail configuration in a crystal phase is more likely. A significant slowing down of the flip-flop relaxation process is observed at the transition between the smectic C and hexagonal smectic X phases.

Title: Predicting the 3D microstructure of SOFC anodes from 2D SEM images using stochastic microstructure modeling and CNNs
Authors: Léon F. Schröder, Sabrina Weber, Lukas Fuchs, Volker Schmidt, Benedikt Prifling
Abstract: The 3D microstructure of solid oxide fuel cell anodes significantly influences their electrochemical performance, but conventional methods for acquiring high-resolution microstructural 3D data such as focused ion beam scanning electron microscopy (FIB-SEM) are costly in both time and resources. In contrast, obtaining 2D images, such as from scanning electron microscopy (SEM), is more accessible, though typically providing insufficient information to accurately characterize the 3D microstructure. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach that predicts the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images. The presented method utilizes a low-parametric 3D model from stochastic geometry to generate a large number of virtual 3D microstructures and employs a physics-based SEM simulation tool to obtain the corresponding 2D SEM images. By systematically varying the underlying model parameters, a large dataset can be generated to train convolutional neural networks (CNNs). By doing so, we can statistically reconstruct the 3D microstructure from 2D SEM images by drawing realizations from the stochastic 3D model using the predicted model parameters. In addition, we conducted an error analysis on key geometrical descriptors to quantitatively evaluate the accuracy and reliability of this stereological prediction tool.

Title: Unveiling the Dimensionality of Networks of Networks
Authors: Lorenzo Grimaldi, Pablo Villegas, Alessandro Vezzani, Raffaella Burioni, Davide Cassi, Andrea Gabrielli
Abstract: "Every object that biology studies is a system of systems." (François Jacob, 1974). Most networks feature intricate architectures originating from tinkering, a repetitive use of existing components where structures are not invented but reshaped. Still, linking the properties of primitive components to the emergent behavior of composite networks remains a key open challenge. Here, by composing scale-invariant networks, we show how tinkering decouples Fiedler and spectral dimensions, hitherto considered identical, providing valuable insights into mesoscopic and macroscopic collective regimes.

Title: Sub-10 nm Quantification of Spin and Orbital Magnetic Moment Across the Metamagnetic Phase Transition in FeRh Using EMCD
Authors: Jan Hajduček, Veronica Leccese, Ján Rusz, Jon Ander Arregi, Alexey Sapozhnik, Jáchym Štindl, Francesco Barantani, Paolo Cattaneo, Antoine Andrieux, Vojtěch Uhlíř, Fabrizio Carbone, Thomas LaGrange
Abstract: Electron magnetic circular dichroism (EMCD) in transmission electron microscopy (TEM) enables element-specific measurement of spin and orbital magnetic moments, analogous to X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD). While the EMCD technique offers unmatched spatial resolution, its quantitative accuracy remains under scrutiny, particularly in beam-splitter geometries with convergent probes. Here, we systematically evaluate the limits of quantitative EMCD analysis using the first-order magnetostructural transition in the functional phase-change material FeRh as a tunable magnetic reference. Unlike previous EMCD studies primarily focused on elemental ferromagnets such as Fe, we demonstrate its applicability to a correlated material exhibiting coupled structural and magnetic order. We demonstrate that the extracted orbital-to-spin moment ratio ($m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$) remains consistent with XMCD benchmarks for TEM probes down to approximately 6 nm, thereby establishing the validity range for reliable quantification. For nm-sized probes with higher convergence angles, we observe an enhanced $m_\text{L}/m_\text{S}$, which we attribute to a combination of instrumental factors and sensitivity to nanoscale heterogeneity within the probed volume. Our results confirm that EMCD provides quantitative agreement with macroscale techniques under suitable conditions, while uniquely enabling spatially confined measurements of local magnetic moments in functional magnetic materials, and allowing the study of interfacial, defect-mediated, or phase-separated magnetism that is inaccessible to photon-based methods.

Title: The effects of high-temperature ion-irradiation on early-stage grain boundaries serrations formation in Ni-based alloys
Authors: M. Frelek-Kozak, K. Mulewska, M. Wilczopolska, D. Kalita, W. Chrominski, A. Zaborowska, L. Kurpaska, J. Jagielski
Abstract: Nickel based superalloys display outstanding properties such as excellent creep strength, remarkable fracture toughness parameters, and corrosion resistance. For this reason, Ni based materials are considered as materials dedicated to the IV generation of nuclear reactors. Although these materials seem promising candidates, their radiation resistance and impact of radiation damage on the deformation mechanism are still not fully understood. In this work, two commercially available nickel based alloys, Hastelloy X and Haynes 230, were investigated. Structural and mechanical properties have been described by means of SEM and EBSD, TEM, and nanoindentation tests. Radiation damage has been performed by Ar ion with energy 320keV with two doses up to 12dpa. Obtained results have revealed a hardening effect for both levels of damage. However, more intensive effects were observed for Hastelloy X. Moreover, a significant change in precipitates morphology in Hastelloy X has been observed. It has been proposed that structural differences between both alloys determine the type of occurring radiation induced processes. Excess energy deposited into materials structure during ion irradiation can lower the temperature of nucleation of high temperature phases, which initiates the formation of grain boundary serrations.

Title: Quantifying robustness and locality of Majorana bound states in interacting systems
Authors: William Samuelson, Juan Daniel Torres Luna, Sebastian Miles, A. Mert Bozkurt, Martin Leijnse, Michael Wimmer, Viktor Svensson
Abstract: Protecting qubits from perturbations is a central challenge in quantum computing. Topological superconductors with separated Majorana bound states (MBSs) provide a strong form of protection that only depends on the locality of perturbations. While the link between MBS separation, robust degeneracy, and protected braiding is well understood in non-interacting systems, recent experimental progress in short quantum-dot-based Kitaev chains highlights the need to establish these connections rigorously for interacting systems. We do this by defining MBSs from many-body ground states and show how their locality constrains their coupling to an environment. This, in turn, quantifies the protection of the energy degeneracy and the feasibility of non-abelian braiding.

Title: Local Density of States as a Probe of Multifractality in Quasiperiodic Moiré Materials
Authors: Ricardo Oliveira, Nicolau Sobrosa, Pedro Ribeiro, Bruno Amorim, Eduardo V. Castro
Abstract: Quasiperiodic moiré materials provide a new platform for realizing critical electronic states, yet a direct and experimentally practical method to characterize this criticality has been lacking. We show that a multifractal analysis of the local density of states (LDOS), accessible via scanning tunneling microscopy, offers an unambiguous signature of criticality from a single experimental sample. Applying this approach to a one-dimensional quasiperiodic model, a stringent test case due to its fractal energy spectrum, we find a clear distinction between the broad singularity spectra $f\left(\alpha\right)$ of critical states and the point-like spectra of extended states. We further demonstrate that these multifractal signatures remain robust over a wide range of energy broadenings relevant to experiments. Our results establish a model-independent, experimentally feasible framework for identifying and probing multifractality in the growing family of quasiperiodic and moiré materials.

Title: Low-temperature electron dephasing rates indicate magnetic disorder in superconducting TiN films
Authors: A. I. Lomakin, E. M. Baeva, N. A. Titova, A. V. Semenov, A. V. Lubenchenko, M. A. Kirsanova, S. A. Evlashin, S. Saha, S. Bogdanov, A. I. Kolbatova, G. N. Goltsman
Abstract: We investigate electron transport and phase-breaking processes in thin titanium nitride (TiN) films of epitaxial quality. Previous studies show that a minute surface magnetic disorder significantly reduces the critical temperature ($T_\mathrm{c}$) and broadens the superconducting transition as the film thickness and device size decrease. We measure electron dephasing rates via magnetoresistance from $T_\mathrm{c}$ to $\sim 4T_\mathrm{c}$ in various-thickness TiN films. Electron dephasing occurs on the picosecond timescale and is nearly independent of temperature, differing from the expected inelastic scattering due to the electron-phonon and electron-electron interactions near $T_\mathrm{c}$, which occur over a nanosecond timescale. We propose spin-flip scattering as a possible additional phase-breaking mechanism. The significant increase in the dephasing rate for the thinnest film indicates that magnetic disorder resides near the surface of naturally oxidized films. Our research suggests that magnetic disorder may be a significant contributor to RF dissipation in superconducting devices based on TiN.

Title: Monte Carlo Sampling for Wave Functions Requiring (Anti)Symmetrization
Authors: Koyena Bose, Steven H. Simon, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: Many strongly correlated states, such as those arising in the fractional quantum Hall effect and spin liquids, are described by wave functions obtained by dividing particles into multiple clusters, constructing a readily evaluable wave function in each cluster, and (anti)symmetrizing across these clusters. We introduce a method to compute quantities such as energies and correlators, using Monte Carlo simulations for these states. Our framework overcomes the factorial scaling of explicit (anti)symmetrization, allowing for studies of systems beyond the reach of exact diagonalization.

Title: Time-braiding phase of anyons tied to the nonuniversal scaling dimension
Authors: Aleksander Latyshev, Ines Safi
Abstract: We use a braiding nonequilibrium fluctuation dissipation relation linking the DC noise to the response function inferred from the braiding constraint in the time-domain with a phase $\theta$ within the UNEPT (Unified Non equilibrium Perturbative Theory). By applying the Kramers-Krönig relations, we obtain an integral equation connecting DC current and noise that involves $\theta$. By specifying to thermal states so that noise is Poissonian, we find an analytical solution for the DC current via the Wiener-Hopf technique. It reveals that the time-braiding phase is determined by the scaling dimension~$\delta$. This questions the universality of $\theta$ that can reflect the microscopic edge dynamics, in contrast to the topologically protected braiding phase in the space domain.

Title: Aging in the Flow Dynamics of Dense Suspensions of Contactless Microparticles
Authors: Jesús Fernández, Loïc Vanel, Antoine Bérut
Abstract: This study demonstrates that the free-surface flow dynamics of dense piles of contactless silica microparticles depend on the resting period prior to flow. Microfluidic rotating drum experiments reveal that longer resting times lead to delayed flow onsets and reduced flow velocities, both evolving logarithmically with the resting time. These aging-like effects are more pronounced for thermally driven creep flows in piles with initial tilting angle below the athermal angle of repose, in contrast to piles initially tilted above this repose angle, where gravity-driven flows tend to gradually erase aging effects. Moreover, we show that the packing fraction does not change during the resting period, and that aging occurs in both monodisperse and polydisperse piles, indicating that crystallization is not required for the time-dependent behavior to appear. Remarkably, vigorous agitation that re-disperses the particles fully restores the piles to their initial state, demonstrating that the observed effects are not due to sample degradation. These findings evidence a form of aging in quiescent suspensions intermediate between colloidal and granular media, where thermal fluctuations, still significant relative to particle weight, progressively stabilize the system, making it more resistant to flow and deformation.

Title: Systematic study of multi-magnon binding energies in the FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain
Authors: Satoshi Nishimoto
Abstract: We present a systematic study of multi-magnon bound states (MBSs) in the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ FM-AFM $J_1$-$J_2$ chain under magnetic fields using the density-matrix renormalization group method. As a quantitative measure of stability, we compute the magnon binding energy $E_{\rm b}(M,p)$ for bound clusters of size $p$ over wide ranges of the frustration ratio $J_2/|J_1|$ and the normalized magnetization $M/M_{\rm s}$. Near saturation, we benchmark our data against the analytic two-magnon result and map out a clear hierarchy of $p$-magnon states, whose phase boundaries follow an empirical scaling $J_{2,{\rm c}}(p;p\!+\!1)/|J_1|\!\approx\!0.34\,p^{-2.3}$ for large $p$. We further quantify the relation between the most stable $p$ and the zero-field pitch angle $\theta$, verifying the conjectured inequality $1/p>\theta/\pi>1/(p+1)$ up to $p \lesssim 9$. The binding energy shows pronounced suppression as $J_2/|J_1|\!\to\!1/4^+$ and, for some frustration values, attains a maximum below full saturation, indicating that partial depolarization enhances bound-magnon mobility. Close to the FM instability, $E_{\rm b}(M_{\rm s},p)$ exhibits an empirical power-law vanishing consistent with a quantum-Lifshitz scenario. Our results provide a comprehensive, experimentally relevant map of MBS stability across field and frustration, offering concrete guidance for inelastic probes in quasi-one-dimensional magnets.

Title: Computational Design Rules for Helical Aromatic Foldamers: $π-π$ Stacking, Solvent Effects, and Conformational Stability
Authors: Kseniia Storozheva, Anastasia Markina, Vladik Avetisov
Abstract: Molecular-scale materials with bistable behavior and tunable properties are increasingly relevant for next-generation nanoscale electronic devices. Helical foldamers are promising candidates, but their structural and mechanical properties are highly sensitive to conformational stability and environmental conditions. A systematic methodology based on quantum-chemical calculations is proposed for assessing solvent-dependent mechanical behavior, combining analysis of $\pi-\pi$ stacking interactions, conformational energetics, and environmental effects. Using this methodology we identified simple design principles for the rapid screening of new compounds, allowing evaluation of their conformational stability and effective mechanical rigidity. Applying these principles, we identify a modified helical aromatic foldamer that exhibits improved mechanical and stability characteristics compared to the initial reference compound.

Title: Kinetics of Peierls dimerization transition: Machine learning force-field approach
Authors: Ho Jang, Yang Yang, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We present a machine learning (ML) force-field framework for simulating the non-equilibrium dynamics of charge-density-wave (CDW) order driven by the Peierls instability. Since the Peierls distortion arises from the coupling between lattice displacements and itinerant electrons, evaluating the adiabatic forces during time evolution is computationally intensive, particularly for large systems. To overcome this bottleneck, we develop a generalized Behler-Parrinello neural-network architecture -- originally formulated for ab initio molecular dynamics -- to accurately and efficiently predict forces from local structural environments. Using the locality of electronic responses, the resulting ML force field achieves linear scaling efficiency while maintaining quantitative accuracy. Large-scale dynamical simulations using this framework uncover a two-stage coarsening behavior of CDW domains: an early-time regime characterized by a power-law growth $L \sim t^{\alpha}$ with an effective exponent $\alpha \approx 0.7$, followed by a crossover to the Allen-Cahn scaling $L \sim \sqrt{t}$ at late times. The enhanced early-time coarsening is attributed to anisotropic domain-wall motion arising from electron-mediated directional interactions. This work demonstrates the promise of ML-based force fields for multiscale dynamical modeling of condensed-matter lattice models.

Title: Conductance Anomaly in a Partially Open Adiabatic Quantum Point Contact
Authors: Donghao Liu, Dmitri Gutman
Abstract: We demonstrate that conductance anomalies can arise in a clean, adiabatic quantum point contact when a channel is partially open. Even for a smooth barrier potential, backscattering induces Friedel oscillations that, via electron interactions, generate a singular correction to the conductance. This correction is maximized when the channel is half-open, resulting in a reduction of conductance. In addition, a magnetic field applied perpendicular to the spin-orbit axis modifies the single-particle spectrum, resulting in conductance oscillations via Fabry-Pérot-type interference, as well as a non-monotonic field dependence of the anomaly. Our findings reveal a universal mechanism by which interactions modify the conductance of an ideal partially open channel and offer a possible explanation for the anomalous features observed in experiments.

Title: Enhancement of Curie Temperature in Ferromagnetic Insulator-Topological Insulator Heterostructures
Authors: Murod Mirzhalilov, Nandini Trivedi, Mohit Randeria
Abstract: We theoretically analyze the topological insulator (TI) surface state mediated interactions between local moments in a proximate 2D ferromagnetic insulator (FMI) motivated by recent experiments that show a significant increase in the Curie temperature Tc of FMI-TI heterostructures. Such interactions have been investigated earlier with a focus on dilute magnetic dopants in TIs. Our problem involves a dense set of moments for which we find that the short range Bloembergen-Rowland interaction, arising from virtual particle-hole transitions between the valence and conduction bands, dominates over the oscillatory Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction. We show that the Tc enhancement is proportional to the Van Vleck susceptibility and that the spin-momentum locking of surface states leads to out-of-plane ferromagnetic order in the FMI. We investigate how the hybridization between top and bottom surfaces in a thin TI film impacts Tc enhancement, and show how our results can help understand recent experiments on atomically thin Cr2Te3-(Bi,Sb)2Te3.

Title: Universal breathing mode scaling in harmonically trapped Fermi gases
Authors: Miguel Tierz
Abstract: We derive universal, experiment ready analytic laws for the breathing (monopole) mode of harmonically trapped Fermi gases. Within a fixed hyperangular channel $s>0$, contact-weighted products of associated Laguerre polynomials reduce to an elementary gamma ratio, yielding: (i) a level resolved fractional breathing mode shift with scaling $\delta\omega/(2\omega)\propto Q^{-1}$, where $Q\equiv 2q+s+1$, with $q$ the radial quantum number; (ii) a first order quantum anomaly correction involving exactly two intermediate states, producing a $Q^{-2}$ falloff of the leaked monopole strength with an explicit prefactor; and (iii) a closed form finite temperature average exhibiting a low-$T$ plateau and a $1/T$ high-$T$ tail. We also obtain a mixed anomaly\nobreakdash-quartic correction for weak anharmonicity. All expressions become parameter free after a single per-channel calibration of the Tan contact $\lambda_s$ at $q=0$.

Title: Nanoscale Mapping of Transition Metal Ordering in Individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 Particles Using 4D-STEM ACOM Technique
Authors: Gozde Oney, Fayçal Adrar, Junhao Cao, Chunyang Zhang, Muriel Véron, Matthieu Bugnet, Emmanuelle Suard, Jacob Olchowka, Laurence Croguennec, François Weill, Arnaud Demortière
Abstract: The electrochemical performance of the spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, a high-voltage positive electrode material for Li-ion batteries, is influenced by the transition metal arrangement in the octahedral network, leading to disordered (Fd m S.G.) and ordered3 (P4332 S.G.) structures. However, widely used techniques lack the spatial resolution necessary to elucidate the ordering phenomenon at the particle scale. Using the 4D-STEM technique, we present the first direct observation of ordering distribution in individual LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles with nanometric spatial resolution. We propose a quantification method for the local degree of ordering based on the ratio of ordered to disordered spinel lattices along the particle thickness extracted from electron diffraction spot intensities. In an ordered spinel LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4, the transition metal ordering is consistently observed throughout the primary particle. However, the extent of ordering in the spinel phase depends on its distribution at the particle scale, a factor influenced by the annealing conditions. The 4D-STEM analysis elucidates the boundary between highly-ordered and low-ordered LiNi0.5Mn1.5O4 particles.

Title: Angular dependence and powder average of resonant inelastic X-ray scattering
Authors: Myrtille O. J. Y Hunault, Timothy G. Burrow, Fabien Besnard, Amélie Juhin, Christian Brouder
Abstract: Resonant Inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) is a synchrotron-based spectroscopy that has seen growing interest across a range of scientific disciplines beyond fundamental physics. The interpretation of experimental RIXS data requires theoretical calculations based on the Kramers-Heisenberg formula. However, due to the dependence of RIXS on both the incident and scattered photon properties, a tractable treatment of the angular dependence in this formula has been lacking. In this work, within the electric dipole approximation, we determine the number of fundamental spectra contributing to the RIXS cross-section for all crystallographic point groups. We then derive a general expression for the RIXS cross-section of isotropic samples such as un-textured powders, homogeneous glasses or liquids, explicitly accounting for the polarization and propagation directions of both the incident and scattered photons. Simplified forms of the RIXS expressions are subsequently obtained for most common point groups. Finally, we demonstrate the applicability of our formalism through a case study of uranium 3d4f RIXS.

Title: Berry Curvature Dipole-induced Non-linear Hall Effect in Oxide Heterostructures
Authors: Nesta Benno Joseph, Arka Bandyopadhyay, Ajit C. Balram, Awadhesh Narayan
Abstract: The observation of non-linear Hall effects in time-reversal invariant systems has established the intriguing role of band topology beyond Berry curvature in determining transport phenomena. Many of these non-linear responses owe their origin to the Berry curvature dipole (BCD), which, like the Berry curvature (monopole), is also an electronic band structure effect, but is routinely strongly constrained by crystalline symmetries. Here, we propose non-centrosymmetric transition metal oxide heterostructures as promising platforms for realizing and tuning BCD-induced non-linear Hall effects. Specifically, we investigate superlattices of the form $(\mathrm{Ba(Os,Ir)}\mathrm{O}_3)_n/(\mathrm{BaTiO}_3)_4$ ($n{=}1, 2$), comprising metallic perovskite layers ($\mathrm{BaOsO_3}$ or $\mathrm{BaIrO_3}$) sandwiched between insulating ferroelectric $\mathrm{BaTiO_3}$ (BTO). The ferroelectric distortion in BTO breaks inversion symmetry of the superlattice, giving rise to a finite BCD with two symmetry-allowed components of equal magnitude and opposite sign. Our first-principles calculations demonstrate that the magnitude of the BCD -- and consequently the nonlinear Hall response -- can be effectively tuned by varying the number of metallic layers or the choice of the B-site cation in these $\mathrm{ABO_3}$ perovskites. Since Rashba splitting and ferroelectric distortion in these systems are readily controllable via an external electric field or strain, the non-linear Hall response in these materials can be directly engineered. Our findings establish non-centrosymmetric oxide perovskite heterostructures as a versatile platform for exploring and manipulating BCD-driven non-linear transport phenomena.

Title: Trapping, manipulating and probing ultracold atoms: a quantum technologies tutorial
Authors: Louise Wolswijk, Luca Cavicchioli, Giuseppe Vinelli, Mauro Chiarotti, Ludovica Donati, Marcia Frometa Fernandez, Diego Hernández Rajkov, Christian Mancini, Paolo Vezio, Tianwei Zhou, Giulia Del Pace, Chiara Mazzinghi, Nicolò Antolini, Leonardo Salvi, Vladislav Gavryusev
Abstract: Engineered ultracold atomic systems are a valuable platform for fundamental quantum mechanics studies and the development of quantum technologies. At near zero absolute temperature, atoms exhibit macroscopic phase coherence and collective quantum behavior, enabling their use in precision metrology, quantum simulation, and even information processing. This review provides an introductory overview of the key techniques used to trap, manipulate, and detect ultracold atoms, while highlighting the main applications of each method. We outline the principles of laser cooling, magnetic and optical trapping, and the most widely used techniques, including optical lattices and tweezers. Next, we discuss the manipulation methods of atomic internal and external degrees of freedom, and we present atom interferometry techniques and how to leverage and control interatomic interactions. Next, we review common ensemble detection strategies, including absorption and fluorescence imaging, state-selective readout, correlation and quantum non-demolition measurements and conclude with high-resolution approaches. This review aims to provide newcomers to the field with a broad understanding of the experimental toolkit that underpins research in ultracold atom physics and its applications across quantum science and technology.

Title: Anomalous Hall effect in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Vera Mikheeva, Daniele Guerci, Daniel Kaplan, Elio J. König
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on rhombohedral stacked multilayer graphene and the observation of the anomalous Hall effect in a spontaneous spin-valley polarized quarter metal state, we calculate the anomalous Hall conductivity for this system in the presence of two types of impurities: weak and dense as well as sparse and strong. Our calculation of $\sigma_{xy}$ is based on the Kubo-Streda diagrammatic approach. In a model with Gaussian disorder applicable to weak dense impurities, this involves all non-crossing diagrams (intrinsic, side-jump and Gaussian skew-scattering contributions) and additionally diagrams with two intersecting impurities, X and $\Psi$, representing diffractive skew-scattering processes. A "Mercedes star" diagram (non-Gaussian skew scattering) is furthermore included to treat in the case of strong, sparse impurities. We supplement our asymptotically exact analytical solutions for an isotropic model without warping effects by semi-numerical calculations accounting perturbatively for warping, which plays a crucial role in the low-energy band structure.

Title: Charge-density waves and stripes in quarter metals of graphene heterostructures
Authors: Sk Asrap Murshed, Bitan Roy
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments, here we identify valley-coherent charge-density wave (VC-CDW) order in the non-degenerate quarter-metal for the entire family of chirally-stacked $n$ layer graphene, encompassing rhombohedral multi-layer, Bernal bilayer, and monolayer cousins. Besides the hallmark broken translational symmetry, yielding a modulated charge-density over an enlarged unit-cell with a characteristic $2{\bf K}$ periodicity, where $\pm {\bf K}$ are the valley momenta, this phase lacks the three-fold ($C_3$) rotational symmetry but only for even integer $n$. The VC-CDW then represents a stripe order, as observed in hexalayer graphene [arXiv:2504.05129], but preserves the $C_3$ symmetry for odd $n$ as observed in trilayer graphene [Nat. Phys. 20, 1413 (2024) and arXiv: 2411.11163]. From a universal Clifford algebraic argument, we establish that the VC-CDW and an anomalous Hall order can lift the residual valley degeneracy of an antiferromagnetically ordered spin-polarized half-metal, when these systems are subject to perpendicular displacement fields, with only the latter one displaying a hysteresis in off-diagonal resistivity, as observed in all the systems with $2 \leq n \leq 6$. We showcase a confluence of VC-CDW and anomalous Hall orders within the quarter-metal, generically displaying a regime of coexistence, separating the pure phases.

Title: Depletion Imaging of Rydberg atoms in cold atomic gases
Authors: M. Ferreira-Cao, V. Gavryusev, T. Franz, R. Ferracini Alves, A. Signoles, G. Zürn, M. Weidemüller
Abstract: We present a depletion imaging technique to map out the spatial and temporal dependency of the density distribution of an ultracold gas of Rydberg atoms. Locally resolved absorption depletion, observed through differential ground state absorption imaging of a $^{87}\text{Rb}$ cloud in presence and absence of pre-excited Rydberg atoms, reveals their projected two-dimensional distribution. By employing a closed two-level optical transition uncoupled from the Rydberg state, the highly excited atoms are preserved during imaging. We measure the excitation dynamics of the $\vert48S\rangle$ state of $^{87}\text{Rb}$, observing a saturation of the two-dimensional Rydberg density. Such outcome can be explained by the Rydberg blockade effect which prevents resonant excitation of close-by Rydberg atoms due to strong dipolar interactions. By combining the superatom description, where atoms within a blockade radius are represented as collective excitations, with a Monte Carlo sampling, we can quantitatively model the observed excitation dynamics and infer the full three-dimensional distribution of Rydberg atoms, that can serve as a starting point for quantum simulation of many-body dynamics involving Rydberg spin systems.

Title: Single Sr Atoms in Optical Tweezer Arrays for Quantum Simulation
Authors: Veronica Giardini, Luca Guariento, Andrea Fantini, Shawn Storm, Massimo Inguscio, Jacopo Catani, Giacomo Cappellini, Vladislav Gavryusev, Leonardo Fallani
Abstract: We report on the realization of a platform for trapping and manipulating individual $^{88}$Sr atoms in optical tweezers. A first cooling stage based on a blue magneto-optical trap (MOT) operating on the $^1S_0$ -> $^1P_1$ transition at 461 nm enables us to trap approximately $4\times 10^6$ atoms at a temperature of 8 mK. Further cooling is achieved in a narrow-line red MOT using the $^1S_0$ -> $^3P_1$ intercombination transition at 689 nm, bringing $4\times 10^5$ atoms down to 5 uK and reaching a density of $\approx 10^{10}$ cm$^{-3}$. Atoms are then loaded into 813 nm tweezer arrays generated by crossed acousto-optic deflectors and tightly focused onto the atoms with a high-numerical-aperture objective. Through light-assisted collision processes we achieve the collisional blockade, which leads to single-atom occupancy with a probability of about $50\%$. The trapped atoms are detected via fluorescence imaging with a fidelity of $99.986(6)\%$, while maintaining a survival probability of $97(1)\%$. The release-and-recapture measurement provides a temperature of $12.92(5)$ uK for the atoms in the tweezers, and the ultra-high-vacuum environment ensures a vacuum lifetime higher than 7 minutes. These results demonstrate a robust alkaline-earth tweezer platform that combines efficient loading, cooling, and high-fidelity detection, providing the essential building blocks for scalable quantum simulation and quantum information processing with Sr atoms.

Title: Fokker-Planck equation governing the distribution of walkers in AFQMC
Authors: Alfred Li, Ankit Mahajan, Sandeep Sharma
Abstract: Auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is typically formulated as an open-ended random walk in an overcomplete space of Slater determinants, implemented through a Langevin equation. However, the explicit form of the underlying Fokker-Planck equation governing the walker population distribution has remained unknown. In this paper, we derive the Fokker-Planck equation for AFQMC and propose a novel numerical scheme to solve it. The solution of the Fokker-Planck equation reveals the wavefunction actually sampled by the AFQMC algorithm. Interestingly, we find that even when the exact ground state is used as a guiding wavefunction in constrained path AFQMC, contrary to the common assumption, the wavefunction sampled by AFQMC is not exact. Beyond clarifying several fundamental aspects of AFQMC, the availability of a Fokker-Planck equation formulation opens new avenues for systematically improving its accuracy, which we outline in this paper.

Title: Beyond Qubits: Multilevel Quantum Sensing for Dark Matter
Authors: Xiaolin Ma, Volodymyr Takhistov, Norikazu Mizuochi, Ernst David Herbschleb
Abstract: Quantum sensing with qubits has advanced fundamental physics searches, but higher dimensional systems offer untapped potential. We present a universal qutrit framework that yields a sequence-independent fourfold increase in quantum Fisher information and a twofold gain in sensitivity. In ultralight dark matter searches, spin-1 NV-center qutrits can enhance the axion-electron coupling reach by an order of magnitude beyond qubits. This principle applies broadly to multilevel quantum systems including superconducting, neutral atom and trapped-ion qutrits, establishing higher dimensional sensing as a powerful tool for probing new physics.

Title: Mind the gaps: The fraught road to quantum advantage
Authors: Jens Eisert, John Preskill
Abstract: Quantum computing is advancing rapidly, yet substantial gaps separate today's noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices from tomorrow's fault-tolerant application-scale (FASQ) machines. We identify four related hurdles along the road ahead: (i) from error mitigation to active error detection and correction, (ii) from rudimentary error correction to scalable fault tolerance, (iii) from early heuristics to mature, verifiable algorithms, and (iv) from exploratory simulators to credible advantage in quantum simulation. Targeting these transitions will accelerate progress toward broadly useful quantum computing.

Title: Modelling multiscale architecture of biofilm extracellular matrix and its role in oxygen transport
Authors: Raghu K. Moorthy, Eoin Casey
Abstract: The extracellular matrix of biofilms presents a dense and intricate architecture. Numerous biophysical properties of the matrix surrounding microbial cells contribute to the heterogeneity of biofilms and their functions at the microscale. Previous mathematical models assume the matrix to be homogeneous, often overlooking the need for a detailed mechanistic understanding of the extracellular space. In this theoretical study, we introduce a novel cell-capsule approach to investigate geometric patterns in biofilm morphology and predict their role in oxygen transport. The thickness of the capsule and the arrangement of cell-capsule patterns can influence matrix heterogeneity, providing a clear picture of biofilm structure. By incorporating the bacterial capsule as a distinct, low-diffusivity phase, our novel cell-capsule model reveals that this architecture acts as a significant 'resistance-in-series' barrier. We found that a thick capsule/dense matrix arrangement can reduce local oxygen transfer by approximately 70%, a substantial drop that may give drive further research into oxygen limitations during early stage biofilm development.

Title: A transmon qubit realized by exploiting the superconductor-insulator transition
Authors: C. G. L. Bøttcher, E. Önder, T. Connolly, J. Zhao, C. Kvande, D. Q. Wang, P. D. Kurilovich, S. Vaitiekėnas, L. I. Glazman, H. X. Tang, M. H. Devoret
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are among the most promising platforms for realizing practical quantum computers. One requirement to create a quantum processor is nonlinearity, which in superconducting circuits is typically achieved by sandwiching a layer of aluminum oxide between two aluminum electrodes to form a Josephson junction. These junctions, however, face several limitations that hinder their scalability: the small superconducting gap of aluminum necessitates millikelvin operating temperatures, the material interfaces lead to dissipation, and the sandwich geometry adds unwelcome capacitance for high-frequency applications. In this work, we address all three limitations using a novel superconducting weak link based on the superconductor-insulator transition. By locally thinning a single film of niobium nitride, we exploit its thickness-driven superconductor-insulator transition to form a weak link employing only atomic layer deposition and atomic layer etching. We utilize our weak links to produce a transmon qubit, '$planaron$', with a measured anharmonicity of $\alpha/2\pi = 235$ MHz; at present, the linewidth is $\kappa/2\pi = 15 \mathrm{\: MHz}$. The high superconducting gap of niobium nitride can enable operation at elevated temperatures in future devices, and the fully planar geometry of the weak link eliminates superfluous material interfaces and capacitances. The investigation of small patches of material near the SIT can shed new light on the nature of the transition, including the role of dissipation and finite-size effects.

Title: Exact State Evolution and Energy Spectrum in Solvable Bosonic Models
Authors: Valery Shchesnovich
Abstract: Solvable bosonic models provide a fundamental framework for describing light propagation in nonlinear media, including optical down-conversion processes that generate squeezed states of light and their higher-order generalizations. In quantum optics a central objective is to determine the time evolution of a given initial state. Exact analytic solution to the state-evolution problem is presented, applicable to a broad class of solvable bosonic models and arbitrary initial states. Moreover, the characteristic equation governing the energy spectrum is derived and the eigenstates are found in the form of continued fractions and as principal minors of the associated Jacobi matrix. The results provide a solid analytical framework for discussion of exactly solvable bosonic models.

Title: Electronically-controlled one- and two-qubit gates for transmon quasicharge qubits
Authors: Nicholas M. Christopher, Deniz E. Stiegemann, Abhijeet Alase, Thomas M. Stace
Abstract: Superconducting protected qubits aim to achieve sufficiently low error rates so as to allow realization of error-corrected, utility-scale quantum computers. A recent proposal encodes a protected qubit in the quasicharge degree of freedom of the conventional transmon device, here referred to as the `quasicharge qubit'. Operating such a protected qubit requires implementing new strategies. Here we show that an electronically-controllable tunnel junction formed by two topological superconductors can be used to implement single- and two-qubit gates on quasicharge qubits. Schemes for both these gates are based on dynamical $4\pi$-periodic Josephson effect and therefore have gate speeds of the same order. The simulation of the dynamics of a topological Josephson junction in a parameter regime with non-negligible charging energy is the key novelty of this work. We also characterize the robustness of such gate operations against charge noise using Fermi's golden rule. Our results point to a compelling strategy for implementation of quasicharge qubit gates based on junctions of minimal Kitaev chains of quantum dots.

Title: Unveiling non-Hermitian band structures with non-Bloch supercells
Authors: Jia-Xin Zhong, Jing Lin, Kai Chen, Jing Lu, Kun Ding, Yun Jing
Abstract: Real-valued band structures are foundational to analyzing periodic systems within the Hermitian description and have been experimentally well-established over recent decades. In contrast, non-Hermitian systems exhibit complex band structures where both energy and momentum have imaginary parts, underpinning phenomena like the non-Hermitian skin effect and anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence that defy conventional Bloch theory. Experimentally mapping these complex bands-relating complex momentum to complex energy-and identifying their associated eigenstates is crucial for understanding these systems but remains a significant challenge. Here, we introduce a non-Bloch supercell framework designed to overcome this challenge by decoupling Bloch phase control from the imaginary part of momentum. Our method combines an exponent-flattening protocol with twisted boundary conditions, enabling system-size-independent control of imaginary momentum while preserving high-resolution Bloch phase sampling. Implemented in programmable one- and two-dimensional acoustic crystals, our approach acquires momentum-resolved complex energy surfaces and biorthogonal eigenmodes by Green's function this http URL obtained using this framework accurately predict open-boundary spectra and eigenstates, findings we verify through separate open-geometry experiments. Our work provides a broadly applicable experimental toolkit for exploring non-Hermitian band geometry and topology in diverse engineered classical and quantum platforms.

Title: From diffusion optics to photocatalytic rates in multiply scattering porous slabs: finite-slab Green's function, optical-to-kinetic mapping, and application to core-shell aerogels with embedded anatase nanoparticles
Authors: Renaud A. L. Vallée, Rénal Backov
Abstract: We derive an end-to-end framework connecting steady-state photon transport in highly scattering porous slabs to surface-bound photocatalytic rates. Starting from the diffusion approximation (DA) with extrapolated (partial-current) boundary conditions, we solve the finite-slab Green's function with an isotropic internal plane source that rigorously maps external illumination to internal fluence. Using photon units for the fluence rate, Phi(z,lambda) [photons m-2 s-1], the local absorption is qa = mu_a * Phi and the primary carrier/radical generation is G = phi_int * qa. Site-limited and Langmuir-Hinshelwood kinetics are driven by G and closed via an accessible surface per macroscopic volume, S_accessible, yielding intrinsic volumetric (per-volume) and areal (per-area) rate constants. We then specialize to air-core/silica-shell monoliths whose shells host anatase TiO2 nanoparticles (NPs): shell refractive indices are calculated by Maxwell-Garnett/Bruggeman mixing; scattering is obtained from Mie theory (PyMieScatt); absorption follows mu_a = n_NP * sigma_abs with n_NP set by NP packing fraction in the shell. The exact slab solution reduces to a compact, design-useful predictor - our Eq. (14) - in a controlled asymptotic that clarifies when the rate scales as l*l/L (strongly diffusive, l << L) versus proportional to l (optically thin, l >> L). We detail measurement and validation protocols (diffuse R/T inversion of mu_s' and mu_a on the same slab, boundary extrapolation accuracy, lateral-loss control) drawing on prior art, and provide a turnkey recipe to compute rates for NP packing-fraction series. The result is a reproducible workflow that preserves design simplicity while resting on a rigorous finite-slab solution.

Title: Microfluidic Study of Evaporation-Driven Crystallization of Saline and Ammonia Brines under Hydrogen Flow
Authors: Karol M. Dąbrowski, Mohammad Nooraiepour, Mohammad Masoudi
Abstract: Underground storage of hydrogen and ammonia in geological formations is essential for renewable energy integration, but salt precipitation during gas injection may threaten storage performance. While extensively studied for CO2 systems, precipitation mechanisms in hydrogen-brine and ammonia-brine systems remain poorly understood. This study presents a comprehensive microfluidic investigation of salt crystallization during hydrogen injection into saline and ammonia-containing brines using high-pressure microfluidics. We conducted 81 high-pressure experiments systematically varying brine composition (1-5 mol/kg NaCl), chemical additives (surfactants, alcohols, ammonia), and hydrogen flow rates (200-1300 mL/min). Quantitative image analysis reveals that hydrogen-induced precipitation differs fundamentally from CO2 systems. Hydrogen drives physical precipitation via evaporation and capillary trapping, producing discrete, localized deposits. In contrast, CO2-ammonia systems generate extensive reactive precipitation of ammonium bicarbonate with interconnected crystal networks. Interfacial tension (IFT) controls both residual brine distribution and final crystal coverage: high-IFT fluids form large, interconnected brine pools promoting extensive crystallization, while low-IFT fluids create isolated pools reducing crystal coverage by 50\%. Alcohol and surfactant additives suppress precipitation by enhancing brine mobility, whereas ammonia paradoxically increases crystal fractions despite lower IFT. Higher flow rates accelerate crystallization across all compositions, enabling operational mitigation strategies. and demonstrate that gas-specific, rather than CO2-analog, risk assessments are essential for underground hydrogen storage design. The effectiveness of chemical additives offers promising pathways for near-wellbore protection in underground hydrogen storage operations.

Title: Data-driven exploration of the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap using Cassiopeia A neutron star observational data
Authors: Yoonhak Nam, Kazuyuki Sekizawa
Abstract: This work aims to elucidate whether the PBF process alone (i.e., without invoking other processes like direct Urca) can explain the observed rapid cooling of Cas~A NS, by incorporating the significant uncertainties in both $q$ and the $^{3}\text{P}_{2}$ pairing gap function into an optimization of cooling models against the Cas~A NS data. To this end, we introduce a novel parametrization of the pairing gap, in which each parameter has a direct physical meaning, and perform systematic parameter-space exploration with the BSk24 equation of state (EoS). Using a newly-developed Fortran-based cooling code coupled to Optuna's TPE algorithm, we conduct both single-objective ($\chi^2$ only) and multi-objective ($\chi^2$ + slope difference) optimizations under identical conditions. By optimizing the neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap parameters to best reproduce the Cas~A NS observational data during repeated neutron-star cooling simulations, we obtain reasonably-behaving neutron $^3\text{P}_2$ pairing gap functions with maximum values of $\Delta_\text{max}\approx$\,0.5--0.6\,MeV. Fixing $M=1.4\,M_\odot$, increasing $q$ progressively drives the optimized gap and the critical temperature $T_\text{c}$ profiles toward smoother, more traditional shapes and improves agreement with the observational data; the PBF efficiency factor of $q\gtrsim0.4$ reproduces the Cas~A NS slope well, whereas $q\simeq0.19$ remains insufficient. Our results support previous indications that enhanced PBF efficiency or additional rapid-cooling channels may be required to fully explain the Cas~A NS observational data. The new parametrization not only improves interpretability but also provides a framework for future Bayesian inference and machine-learning applications. Extensions of this work will further advance the systematic study of dense-matter physics with neutron-star cooling. (Shortened due to the arXiv words limit.)

Title: Thermodynamics and statistical mechanical ensembles of black holes and self-gravitating matter
Authors: Tiago V. Fernandes
Abstract: Black holes exist all over our Universe, possessing a very wide range of masses. At the moment, they serve as a probe to test general relativity at astrophysical scales, but in the future they may also give us information about gravity at the microscale. Black holes seem to have thermodynamic properties, such as the Bekenstein-Hawking entropy, which are important when considering black holes with size of a few centimeters or smaller. Since entropy in statistical mechanics is related to the number of microstates of a system, several questions arise: what gives rise to the black hole entropy? Can it be explained by a quantum description of gravity? In order to further study these questions, the connection between thermodynamics and gravity must be explored at the microscale. In this doctoral thesis, we aim to understand this connection using two descrip-tions that yield the thermodynamics of curved spacetimes. We start by imposing the first law of thermodynamics to a charged self-gravitating matter thin shell in higher dimensions and choose equations of state which allow the study of the black hole limit and the recovery of black hole thermodynamics. Furthermore, we use the Euclidean path integral approach to quantum gravity to construct statistical ensembles of black hole spacetimes and self-gravitating matter, in order to study semiclassically the phase transitions between hot matter and black holes. We show the power of the formalism in obtaining the thermodynamic properties of curved spacetimes. Namely, we study the canonical and grand canonical ensemble of charged black holes inside a cavity, which may have a finite or infinite radius. We construct ensembles of a self-gravitating matter thin shell, both in anti-de Sitter and in asymptotically flat spaces, in order to understand the thermodynamic features of the shell and the possible phase transitions to black hole configurations.

Title: Long time behaviour of one facilitated kinetically constrained models: results and open problems
Authors: Fabio Martinelli, Assaf Shapira, Cristina Toninelli
Abstract: Kinetically constrained models (KCMs) are interacting particle systems introduced in the '80s by physicists to have accessible stochastic models with glassy-type dynamics. The key mechanism behind the complex evolution of these otherwise simple models is the so-called dynamical facilitation, a feature embedded into the models via appropriate kinetic constraints. KCMs are reversible with respect to a Bernoulli product measure, and the analysis of their stationary evolution has witnessed significant progress in the last decade. Unfortunately, in the interesting regime when the equilibrium density of the facilitating vertices is small, many fundamental questions concerning the non-stationary evolution of even the simplest models remain unsolved. In this paper, we discuss some of these questions, along with partial new results and conjectures, for the one facilitated model and its variants, as well as for the biased annihilating branching process.

Title: Phenomenological Noise Models and Optimal Thresholds of the 3D Toric Code
Authors: Ji-Ze Xu, Yin Zhong, Miguel A. Martin-Delgado, Hao Song, Ke Liu
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) topological codes offer the advantage of supporting fault-tolerant implementations of non-Clifford gates, yet their performance against realistic noise remains largely unexplored. In this work, we focus on the paradigmatic 3D toric code and investigate its fault-tolerance thresholds in the presence of both Pauli and measurement errors. Two randomly coupled lattice gauge models that describe the code's correctability are derived, including a random 2-form $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory. By exploiting a generalized duality technique, we show that the 3D toric code exhibits optimal thresholds of $p^{X,M}_{th} \approx 11\%$ and $p^{Z,M}_{th} \approx 2\%$ against bit-flip and phase-flip errors, respectively. These threshold values show modest reductions compared to the case of perfect measurements, establishing the robustness of the 3D toric code against measurement errors. Our results constitute a substantial advance towards assessing the practical performance of 3D topological codes. This contribution is timely and in high demand, as rapid hardware advancements are bringing complex codes into experimental reach. Moreover, our work highlights the interdisciplinary nature of fault-tolerant quantum computation and holds significant interest for quantum information science, high-energy physics, and condensed matter physics.

Title: Beneath the kinetic interpretation of noise
Authors: Carlos Escudero, Helder Rojas
Abstract: Diffusion theory establishes a fundamental connection between stochastic differential equations and partial differential equations. The solution of a partial differential equation known as the Fokker-Planck equation describes the probability density of the stochastic process that solves a corresponding stochastic differential equation. The kinetic interpretation of noise refers to a prospective notion of stochastic integration that would connect a stochastic differential equation with a Fokker-Planck equation consistent with the Fick law of diffusion, without introducing correction terms in the drift. This work is devoted to identifying the precise conditions under which such a correspondence can occur. One of these conditions is a structural constraint on the diffusion tensor, which severely restricts its possible form and thereby renders the kinetic interpretation of noise a non-generic situation. This point is illustrated through a series of examples. Furthermore, the analysis raises additional questions, including the possibility of defining a stochastic integral inspired by numerical algorithms, the behavior of stochastic transport equations in heterogeneous media, and the development of alternative models for anomalous diffusion. All these topics are addressed using stochastic analytical tools similar to those employed to study the main problem: the existence of the kinetic interpretation of noise.

Title: Dynamic principles of concentration buffering through liquid-liquid phase separation
Authors: Logan de Monchaux-Irons, T-Y Dora Tang, Christoph A. Weber, Thomas C.T. Michaels
Abstract: Living systems must maintain robust biochemical function despite fluctuations that span a wide range of timescales. Biomolecular condensates formed by liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) have been shown to buffer concentration fluctuations, but the principles governing their dynamic regulation remain unclear. We address this by probing the response of LLPS to oscillatory perturbations that mimic fluctuations across different timescales, establishing the first systematic frequency-domain analysis of concentration buffering by condensates. We find that condensates act as frequency-selective filters: the perturbed dilute phase behaves as a high-pass filter, while the dense phase attenuates both low- and high-frequency perturbations. We establish quantitative links between LLPS parameters including interaction strength, droplet size, and molecular diffusivity, and the timescale range over which condensates effectively buffer concentration fluctuations. These findings establish the fundamental dynamical limits of concentration buffering by LLPS, with implications for how cells may use LLPS to adapt to fluctuating environments and for the design of synthetic condensates with programmable control properties.

Title: Constructing Local Symmetric Operator Algebras via Reflection Positivity
Authors: Zhengwei Liu, Zishuo Zhao
Abstract: We establish a framework with reflection positivity as the first principle for constructing the boundary theory of topologically ordered quantum spin systems. Assuming reflection positivity, we prove the equivalence between the non-degeneracy of the ground state on the sphere and the local-indistinguishability of local ground states of a frustration-free Hamiltonian. We apply the Osterwalder-Schrader (OS) reconstruction to construct the local symmetric operator algebras, which characterize the emergent categorical symmetry in the ground states.

Title: Real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Marco Hoffmann, Shaohai Chen, Gunasheel Kauwtilyaa Krishnaswamy, Hang Khume Tan, Sherry L. K. Yap, James Lourembam, Anjan Soumyanarayanan, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: Voltage control of magnetic anisotropy (VCMA) induced by charge accumulation is typically considered as an ultrafast process, enabling energy-efficient and high-speed magnetization switching in spintronic devices. In this work, we investigate the real-time dynamics of VCMA-assisted switching of magnetic tunnel junctions via relaxation in a magnetic field. We show that device-dependent charging effects and magnetic granularity in the free layer limit the switching speed at applied voltages close to the critical switching threshold. Increasing the voltage or the applied magnetic field reduces the incubation delay and total switching time to below a few ns. Micromagnetic simulations incorporating the finite charging times of the tunnel junction and the granularity of the magnetic film reproduce the experimental results, providing critical insights into optimizing VCMA-driven magnetization control for memory and logic applications.

Title: Magnetic tunnel junction as a real-time entropy source: Field-Programmable Gate Array based random bit generation without post-processing
Authors: Troy Criss, Ahmed Sidi El Valli, Naomi Li, Andrew Haas, Andrew D. Kent
Abstract: We demonstrate a method to generate application-ready truly random bits from a magnetic tunnel junction driven by a Field-Programmable Gate Array (FPGA). We implement a real-time feedback loop that stabilizes the switching probability near 50\% and apply an XOR operation, both on the FPGA, to suppress short-term correlations, together mitigating long-term drift and bias in the bitstream. This combined approach enables NIST-compliant random bit generation at 5~Mb/s without post-processing, providing a practical hardware solution for fast and reliable true random number generation. Beyond cryptographic applications, these capabilities open opportunities for stochastic hardware accelerators, probabilistic computing, and large-scale modeling where real-time access to unbiased randomness is essential.

Title: Critical Dynamics of Superfluids
Authors: Aristomenis Donos, Polydoros Kailidis
Abstract: We use standard techniques of hydrodynamics to construct a relativistic effective field theory for the low energy dynamics of nearly critical superfluids. In an appropriate non-relativistic limit, our theory predicts an additional coefficient when compared and contrasted to earlier work of Khalatnikov and Lebedev. In addition, we provide an alternative derivation of the same effective theory, using the Keldysh-Schwinger framework for non-equilibrium systems. Finally, we comment on the comparison with the results of an appropriate holographic computation presented in a companion paper. This provides further evidence in support of the theory we propose and confirms the existence of the extra coefficient we identified.

Title: Theta-term in Russian Doll Model: phase structure, quantum metric and BPS multifractality
Authors: Alexander Gorsky, Ilya Lyubimov
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the deterministic and disordered versions of the Russian Doll Model (RDM), which is a generalization of Richardson model of superconductivity in a finite system with time-reversal symmetry breaking parameter $\theta$. It is one of the simplest examples of the cyclic RG where $\log N$ plays the role of the RG time. The deterministic model is integrable and shares the same Bethe Ansatz (BA) equations with the inhomogeneous twisted XXX spin chain. We analyze the quantum metric, the Berry curvature, and the fractal dimension in the sector with a single Cooper pair. A rich phase structure in the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane is found, where $\gamma \log N$ quantifies the hopping term. For the deterministic RDM we clearly identify the extended domain of non-ergodic multifractal phase on the $(\theta,\gamma)$ parameter plane supporting the reentrance transitions between the localized, ergodic, and multifractal phases. We find the pattern of phase transitions in the global charge $Q(\theta,\gamma)$, which arises from the BA equation. In particular, in the multifractal phase in the deterministic model $Q(\gamma)$ exhibits the analogue of "charge concentration" and fortuity phenomena discussed in the context of black hole microstates at finite $N$. The BA equations in RDM exactly coincide with the equations defining the ground states in the theory on the worldvolume of the vortex strings in $N_F=2N_C$ ${\cal N}=2$ SQCD at a strong coupling point $\frac{1}{g_{YM}^2}=0$ with identification $\theta_{RDM}= \theta_{4D}-\pi$. We conjecture that the Hamiltonian of the RDM model describes the mixing in particular 2d-4d BPS sector of the Hilbert space. Our findings provide an example of the BPS multifractality regime for the probe operator in the sector of Hilbert space, and we comment on the possible application to dense QCD with $\theta$ term.

Title: Quantum Sensing of Gravitational Frame-Dragging with a Superfluid $^4$He Gyrometer
Authors: Kai-Isaak Ellers, Marios Christodoulou, K.C. Schwab, K. Birgitta Whaley
Abstract: We propose a laboratory-scale experiment to locally measure the general relativistic frame-dragging effect on Earth using the macroscopic quantum properties of a novel superfluid $^4$He single Josephson junction gyrometer. We derive the frame-dragging and related geodetic and Thomas effects in the superfluid gyrometer and present a procedure for their experimental measurement. We compute the expected thermal noise floor and find that very high sensitivity can be expected at millikelvin temperatures, where near-future Josephson junctions using nanoporous 2D materials are expected to operate. Assuming utilization of the lowest mechanical loss materials, we find a noise spectral density of $5\times 10^{-17}$ rads/s/$\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$ at 10 mK, which is sufficient to resolve the frame-dragging rate to 0.2% within one second of measurement, giving a rotational sensitivity of 1 revolution in 4 Byrs. This extreme sensitivity to rotation corresponds to a measurement of proper time differences as small as $10^{-35}$ s.

Title: Field theory for optimal signal propagation in ResNets
Authors: Kirsten Fischer, David Dahmen, Moritz Helias
Abstract: Residual networks have significantly better trainability and thus performance than feed-forward networks at large depth. Introducing skip connections facilitates signal propagation to deeper layers. In addition, previous works found that adding a scaling parameter for the residual branch further improves generalization performance. While they empirically identified a particularly beneficial range of values for this scaling parameter, the associated performance improvement and its universality across network hyperparameters yet need to be understood. For feed-forward networks, finite-size theories have led to important insights with regard to signal propagation and hyperparameter tuning. We here derive a systematic finite-size field theory for residual networks to study signal propagation and its dependence on the scaling for the residual branch. We derive analytical expressions for the response function, a measure for the network's sensitivity to inputs, and show that for deep networks the empirically found values for the scaling parameter lie within the range of maximal sensitivity. Furthermore, we obtain an analytical expression for the optimal scaling parameter that depends only weakly on other network hyperparameters, such as the weight variance, thereby explaining its universality across hyperparameters. Overall, this work provides a theoretical framework to study ResNets at finite size.

Title: Kitaev-Heisenberg exchange on $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ cobaltate platform
Authors: Pritam Bhattacharyya, Abdul Basit, Thorben Petersen, Stephan Rachel, Satoshi Nishimoto, Liviu Hozoi
Abstract: The detection of considerable spin frustration in honeycomb cobalt oxide compounds indicates the presence of sizable Kitaev interactions in these systems, enlarging the pool of Kitaev spin liquid candidates. Several key questions remain to be answered, such as the magnitude of Kitaev couplings in cobaltates and how to engineer those, by either chemical or physical means. Analyzing the quantum chemistry of interacting magnetic moments in Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$, a representative $LS$-coupled $t_{2g}^5e_g^2$ Co$^{2+}$ oxide, we find that the Kitaev and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions are substantial and antiferromagnetic but somewhat weaker than the Heisenberg contribution. Except $\Gamma'$, all nearest-neighbor couplings are mainly determined by Coulomb exchange, different from current representations of anisotropic interaction terms. This highlights the limits of existing anisotropic models and the need for systematic wave-function quantum chemical studies to clarify exchange mechanisms in Kitaev-Heisenberg magnets and the way of tuning intersite couplings towards the Kitaev spin liquid ground state.

Title: Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond
Authors: Tan Van Vu, Keiji Saito
Abstract: Elucidating fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined error margin. In the context of cooling, the unattainability principle of the third law of thermodynamics asserts that infinite "resources" are needed to reach absolute zero. However, the precise identification of relevant resources and how they jointly constrain achievable error remains unclear within the frameworks of stochastic and quantum thermodynamics. In this work, we introduce the concept of separated states, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states, and formulate the corresponding thermokinetic cost and error, thereby establishing a unifying framework for a broad class of thermodynamic operations. We then uncover a three-way trade-off relation between time, cost, and error for thermodynamic operations aimed at creating separated states, simply expressed as $\tau\mathcal{C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge 1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore, we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a pure state with a given error.

Title: Exceptional Points, Bulk-Boundary Correspondence, and Entanglement Properties for a Dimerized Hatano-Nelson Model with Staggered Potentials
Authors: Yasamin Mardani, Rodrigo A. Pimenta, Jesko Sirker
Abstract: It is well-known that the standard bulk-boundary correspondence does not hold for non-Hermitian systems in which also new phenomena such as exceptional points do occur. Here we study, mostly by analytical means, a paradigmatic one-dimensional non-Hermitian model with dimerization, asymmetric hopping, and imaginary staggered potentials. We present analytical solutions for the singular-value and the eigensystem of this model with both open and closed boundary conditions. We explicitly demonstrate that the proper bulk-boundary correspondence is between topological winding numbers in the periodic case and singular values, {\it not eigenvalues}, in the open case. These protected singular values are connected to hidden edge modes which only become exact zero-energy eigenmodes in the semi-infinite chain limit. We also show that a non-trivial topology leads to protected eigenvalues in the entanglement spectrum. In the $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric case, we find that the model has a so far overlooked phase where exceptional points become dense in the thermodynamic limit. This phase shows unusual hyper-ballistic transport properties with a dynamical critical exponent $z=1/2$.

Title: A unified quantum framework for electrons and ions: The self-consistent harmonic approximation on a neural network curved manifold
Authors: Lorenzo Monacelli, Antonio Siciliano, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: The numerical solution of the many-body problem of interacting electrons and ions is a key challenge in condensed matter physics, chemistry, and materials science. Traditional methods to solve the multi-component quantum Hamiltonian are usually specialized for one kind of particles -- electrons or ions -- and can suffer from a methodological gap when applied to the other ones. This work extends the self-consistent harmonic approximation, a proven successful technique for simulating quantum ions at finite temperatures in anharmonic crystals, to electrons. The approach minimizes the total free energy by optimizing an ansatz density matrix, solving a fermionic self-consistent harmonic Hamiltonian on a curved manifold parametrized through a neural network. This approach preserves an analytical expression for entropy, enabling the direct computation of free energies and phase diagrams of materials. By benchmarking this technique across several prototypical cases -- a double-well potential, the hydrogen atom, and the H$_2$ dissociation -- we demonstrate it can address both the ground- and excited-state properties of electronic systems, capture quantum tunneling and static electronic correlations, thereby providing a unified quantum framework of electrons and atomic nuclei.

Title: Nonlinear stage of modulational instability in repulsive two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: S. Mossman, S.I. Mistakidis, G. C. Katsimiga, A. Romero-Ros, G. Biondini, P. Schmelcher, P. Engels, P. G. Kevrekidis
Abstract: Modulational instability (MI) is a fundamental phenomenon in the study of nonlinear dynamics, spanning diverse areas such as shallow water waves, optics, and ultracold atomic gases. In particular, the nonlinear stage of MI has recently been a topic of intense exploration, and has been shown to manifest, in many cases, in the generation of dispersive shock waves (DSWs). In this work, we experimentally probe the MI dynamics in an immiscible two-component ultracold atomic gas with exclusively repulsive interactions, catalyzed by a hard-wall-like boundary produced by a repulsive optical barrier. We analytically describe the expansion rate of the DSWs in this system, generalized to arbitrary inter-component interaction strengths and species ratios. We observe excellent agreement among the analytical results, an effective 1D numerical model, full 3D numerical simulations, and experimental data. Additionally, we extend this scenario to the interaction between two counterpropagating DSWs, which leads to the production of Peregrine soliton structures. These results further demonstrate the versatility of atomic platforms towards the controlled realization of DSWs and rogue waves.

Title: Interleaved bond frustration in a triangular lattice antiferromagnet

Abstract: Frustration of long-range order via lattice geometries serves to amplify fluctuations of the order parameter and generate unconventional ground states that are highly sensitive to perturbations. Traditionally, this concept of geometric frustration is used to engineer unconventional magnetic states in a variety of materials; however, the charge degree of freedom and bond order can be similarly frustrated. Finding materials that host both frustrated magnetic and bond networks holds promise for engineering structural and magnetic states with the potential of coupling to one another via either the magnetic sector (via magnetic field) or via the lattice sector (via strain). In this paper, we identify an unusual instance of this coexistence in the triangular lattice antiferromagnetic compounds $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ ($Ln$ = La, Ce, Pr, and Nd). These compounds feature two-dimensional planes of unique trigonal-planar CdP$_3$ units that manifest an underlying bond instability with its long-range ordering frustrated via emergent kagome ice bond correlations. Our results establish $Ln$Cd$_3$P$_3$ as a rare class of materials where frustrated magnetism across a tunable rare-earth triangular network is embedded within a dopable semiconductor with a frustrated bond order instability.

Title: Observation of Orbital Hall Effect in Si

Abstract: Controlling/storing information carriers, such as electron charge and spin, is key for modern information society, and significant efforts have been paid made to establish novel technologies at the nanoscale. The rise of Si-based semiconductor technology and magnetism-based technology has been motivated by the aforementioned demands. However, both technologies have been individually developed, with little effort in fusing them. Hence, establishing a technology to bridge semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies that would allow realization of a novel information device is strongly awaited. In line with this research strategy, the creation of a magnetic device using semiconductors would enable fundamental innovation. Here, we show that a mother material for modern electronics, Si, gives rise to a room-temperature orbital Hall effect (OHE), enabling the creation of novel energy-efficient magnetic memory via efficient torque generation. The orbital torque efficiency {\xi}JDL of Si largely exceeds that of the archetypal metallic materials used in the OHE. Our achievement overturns the conventional understanding that nonmagnetic semiconductors cannot play a pivotal role in magnetic devices and paves a new avenue for creating novel information devices through the fusion of semiconductor and magnetism-based technologies.

Title: Critical Probability Distributions of the order parameter at two loops I: Ising universality class
Authors: Sankarshan Sahu
Abstract: There exists an entire family of universal PDFs of the magnetization mode of the three dimensional Ising model parameterized by $\zeta = \lim_{L,\xi_{\infty}}L/\xi_{\infty}$ which is the ratio of the system size $L$ to the bulk correlation length $\xi_{\infty}$ with both the thermodynamic limit and the critical limit being taken simultaneously at fixed $\zeta$. Recently, the probability distribution functions (PDFs) of the magnetization mode of the three-dimensional Ising model has been computed at one-loop in the $\epsilon=4-d$ expansion [arXiv preprint arXiv:2407.12603 (2024)]. We show how these PDFs or, equivalently, the rate functions which are their logarithm, can be systematically computed at second order of the perturbative expansion. We compute the whole family of universal rate-functions and show that their agreement with the Monte Carlo data improves significantly at this order when compared to their one-loop counterpart.

Title: Photoinduced twist and untwist of moiré superlattices in TMDC heterobilayers

Abstract: Two-dimensional moiré materials are formed by artificially stacking atomically thin monolayers. A wealth of correlated and topological quantum phases can be engineered via precise choice of stacking geometry. These designer electronic properties depend crucially on interlayer coupling and atomic registry. An important open question is how atomic registry responds on ultrafast timescales to optical excitation and whether the moiré geometry can be dynamically reconfigured to tune emergent phenomena in real time. Here we show that femtosecond photoexcitation drives a coherent twist-untwist motion of the moiré superlattice in $2^\circ$ and $57^\circ$ twisted WSe$_2$/MoSe$_2$ heterobilayers, resolved directly by ultrafast electron diffraction. Upon above-band-gap photoexcitation, the moiré superlattice diffraction features are enhanced within 1 ps and subsequently suppressed several picoseconds after, deviating markedly from typical photoinduced lattice heating. Kinetic diffraction analysis, supported by simulations of the sample dynamics, indicates a peak-to-trough local twist angle modulation of $0.6^\circ$, correlated with a sub-THz frequency moiré phonon. This motion is driven by ultrafast charge transfer that transiently increases interlayer attraction. Our results could lead to ultrafast control of moiré periodic lattice distortions and, by extension, the local moiré potential that shapes excitons, polarons, and correlation-driven behaviors

Title: Stable time rondeau crystals in dissipative many-body systems
Authors: Zhuocheng Ma, Jin Yan, Hongzheng Zhao, Liang-You Peng
Abstract: Driven systems offer the potential to realize a wide range of non-equilibrium phenomena that are inaccessible in static systems, such as the discrete time crystals. Time rondeau crystals with a partial temporal order have been proposed as a distinctive prethermal phase of matter in systems driven by structured random protocols. Yet, heating is inevitable in closed systems and time rondeau crystals eventually melt. We introduce dissipation to counteract heating and demonstrate stable time rondeau crystals, which persist indefinitely, in a many-body interacting system. A key ingredient is synchronization in the non-interacting limit, which allows for stable time rondeau order without generating excessive heating. The presence of many-body interaction competes with synchronization and a de-synchronization phase transition occurs at a finite interaction strength. This transition is well captured via a linear stability analysis of the underlying stochastic processes.

Title: Topological defect engineering enables size and shape control in self-assembly
Authors: Lara Koehler, Markus Eder, Vincent Ouazan-Reboul, Christoph Karfusehr, Andrey Zelenskiy, Pierre Ronceray, Friedrich C. Simmel, Martin Lenz
Abstract: The self-assembly of complex structures from engineered subunits is a major goal of nanotechnology, but controlling their size becomes increasingly difficult in larger assemblies. Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.

Title: The Global Diffusion Limit for the Space Dependent Variable-Order Time-Fractional Diffusion Equation
Authors: Christopher N. Angstmann, Daniel S. Han, Bruce I. Henry, Boris Z. Huang, Zhuang Xu
Abstract: The diffusion equation and its time-fractional counterpart can be obtained via the diffusion limit of continuous-time random walks with exponential and heavy-tailed waiting time distributions. The space dependent variable-order time-fractional diffusion equation is a generalization of the time-fractional diffusion equation with a fractional exponent that varies over space, modelling systems with spatial heterogeneity. However, there has been limited work on defining a global diffusion limit and an underlying random walk for this macroscopic governing equation, which is needed to make meaningful interpretations of the parameters for applications. Here, we introduce continuous time and discrete time random walk models that limit to the variable-order fractional diffusion equation via a global diffusion limit and space- and time- continuum limits. From this, we show how the master equation of the discrete time random walk can be used to provide a numerical method for solving the variable-order fractional diffusion equation. The results in this work provide underlying random walks and an improved understanding of the diffusion limit for the variable-order fractional diffusion equation, which is critical for the development, calibration and validation of models for diffusion in spatially inhomogeneous media with traps and obstacles.

Title: Investigation of Low Frequency Noise in CryoCMOS devices through Statistical Single Defect Spectroscopy
Authors: Edoardo Catapano, Anirudh Varanasi, Philippe Roussel, Robin Degraeve, Yusuke Higashi, Ruben Asanovski, Ben Kaczer, Javier Diaz Fortuny, Michael Waltl, Valeri Afanasiev, Kristiaan De Greve, Alexander Grill
Abstract: High 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices is a critical parameter to keep under control in the design of complex circuits for low temperatures applications. Current models predict the 1/f noise to scale linearly with temperature, and gate oxide defects are expected to freeze out at cryogenic temperatures. Nevertheless, it has been repeatedly observed that 1/f noise deviates from the predicted behaviour and that gate oxide defects are still active around 4.2 K, producing random telegraph noise. In this paper, we probe single gate oxide defects in 2500 nMOS devices down to 5 K in order to investigate the origin of 1/f noise in CryoCMOS devices. From our results, it is clear that the number of defects active at cryogenic temperatures resulting in random telegraph noise is larger than at 300 K. Threshold voltage shifts due to charged defects are shown to be exponentially distributed, with different modalities across temperatures and biases: from monomodal at 300 K to trimodal below 100 K. The third mode is interpreted in the framework of percolation theory. By fitting these distributions, it is shown that more than 80% of the detected defects belongs to the oxide bulk. Afterwards, starting from the raw data in time domain, we reconstruct the low frequency noise spectra, highlighting the contributions of defects belonging to different branches and, therefore, to different oxide layers. This analysis shows that, although interface traps and large defects associated with the third mode are the main sources of 1/f noise at 5 K, bulk oxide defects still contribute significantly to low-frequency noise at cryogenic temperatures. Finally, we show that defect time constants and step heights are uncorrelated, proving that elastic tunnelling model for charge trapping is not accurate.

Title: Multisetting protocol for Bell correlated states detection with spin-$f$ systems
Authors: Arkadiusz Kobus, Xinwei Li, Mariusz Gajda, Li You, Emilia Witkowska
Abstract: We propose a multisetting protocol for the detection of two-body Bell correlations, and apply it to spin-nematic squeezed states realized in $f$ pairs of SU(2) subsystems within spin-$f$ atomic Bose-Einstein condensates. Experimental data for $f=1$, alongside with numerical simulations using the truncated Wigner method for $f=1,\,2,\,3$, demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed protocol. Our findings extend the reach of multisetting Bell tests in ultracold atomic system, paving the way for extended quantum information processing in high-spin ensemble platforms.

Title: Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system
Authors: Jimin Bai, Peter Keim, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. Moreover, this phenomenon has been never tested across a continuous glass transition between a liquid phase and a glassy state with large but finite viscosity. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap opens continuously at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. By extracting the instantaneous shear velocity from the experimental data, we uncover a shear relaxation time exhibiting a super-Arrhenius temperature dependence characteristic of glass-forming materials, accurately described by the Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT) relation. Our results confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework and highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.

Title: Factor of 1000 suppression of the depolarization rate in ultracold thulium collisions

Abstract: Lanthanides are nowadays extensively used to investigate the properties of strongly correlated matter. Nevertheless, exploiting the Zeeman manifold of a lanthanide atom ground state is challenging due to the unavoidable presence of depolarization collisions. Here we demonstrate that in the case of the thulium atom, it is possible to suppress this depolarization by a factor of 1000 with a carefully tuned magnetic field thus opening the way for the efficient use of the Zeeman manifold in quantum simulations.

Title: Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions
Authors: C J Bradly, N R Beaton, A L Owczarek
Abstract: We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Emergent quantum field theories on curved spacetimes in spinor Bose-Einstein condensates: from scalar to Proca fields
Authors: Christian F. Schmidt, Simon Brunner, Stefan Floerchinger
Abstract: We consider excitations of a spin-1 Bose-Einstein-condensate (BEC) in the vicinity of different mean-field configurations and derive mappings to emergent relativistic quantum field theories minimally coupled to curved acoustic spacetimes. The quantum fields are typically identified with Nambu-Goldstone bosons, such that the structure of the analogue quantum field theories on curved spacetimes depends on the (spontaneous) symmetry breaking pattern of the respective ground-state. The emergent spacetime geometries are independent of each other and exhibit bi-metricity in the polar and antiferromagnetic phase, whereas one has tri-metricity in the ferromagnetic phase. Compared to scalar BECs, the spinor degrees of freedom allow to investigate massive vector and scalar fields where the former is a spin-nematic rotation mode in the polar phase which can be cast into a Proca field that is minimally coupled to a curved spacetime that emerges on length scales larger than the spin-healing length. Finally, we specify the Zeeman couplings and the condensate trap to be spacetime-dependent such that a cosmological FLRW-metric can be achieved. This work enables a pathway towards quantum-simulating cosmological particle production of Proca quanta via quenching the quadratic Zeeman-coefficient or via magnetic field ramps, which both result in the creation of spin-nematic squeezed states.

Title: Viscosity, breakdown of Stokes-Einstein relation and dynamical heterogeneity in supercooled liquid Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ from simulations with a neural network potential
Authors: Simone Marcorini, Rocco Pomodoro, Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi
Abstract: Phase change materials are exploited in non-volatile electronic memories and photonic devices that rely on a fast and reversible transformation between the amorphous and crystalline phase upon heating. The recrystallization of the amorphous phase at the operation conditions of the memories occurs in the supercooled liquid phase above the glass transition temperature $T_g$. The dynamics of the supercooled liquid is thus of great relevance for the operation of the devices and, close to $T_g$, also for the structural relaxations of the glass that affect the performances of the memories. Information on the atomic dynamics is provided by the diffusion coefficient ($D$) and by the viscosity ($\eta$) which are, however, both difficult to be measured experimentally at the operation conditions of the devices due to the fast crystallization. In this work, we leverage a machine learning interatomic potential for the flagship phase change compound compound Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ to compute $\eta$, $D$ and the $\alpha$-relaxation time in a wide temperature range from 1200 K to about 100 K above $T_g$. Large scale molecular dynamics simulations allowed quantifying the fragility of the liquid and the occurrence of a breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation between $\eta$ and $D$ in the supercooled phase. Isoconfigurational analysis provided a visualization of the emergence of dynamical heterogeneities responsible for the breakdown of the Stokes-Einstein relation. The analysis revealed that the regions of most mobile atoms are related to the presence of Ge atoms with particular local environments.

Title: Two dimensional sub-wavelength topological dark state lattices
Authors: Domantas Burba, Gediminas Juzeliūnas
Abstract: We present a general framework for engineering two-dimensional (2D) sub-wavelength topological optical lattices using spatially dependent atomic dark states in a $\Lambda$-type configuration of the atom-light coupling. By properly designing the spatial profiles of the laser fields inducing coupling between the atomic internal states, we show how to generate sub-wavelength Kronig-Penney-like geometric scalar potential accompanied by narrow and strong patches of the synthetic magnetic field localized in the same areas as the scalar potential. These sharply peaked magnetic fluxes are compensated by a smooth background magnetic field of opposite sign, resulting in zero net flux per unit cell while still enabling topologically nontrivial band structures. Specifically, for sufficiently narrow peaks, their influence is minimum, and the behavior of the system in a remaining smooth background magnetic field resembles the Landau problem, allowing for the formation of nearly flat energy bands with unit Chern numbers. Numerical analysis confirms the existence of ideal Chern bands and the robustness of the topological phases against non-adiabatic effects and losses. This makes the scheme well-suited for simulating quantum Hall systems and fractional Chern insulators in ultracold atomic gases, offering a new platform for exploring strongly correlated topological phases with high tunability.

Title: Magnetic dilution in the triangular lattice antiferromagnet NaYb$_{1-x}$Lu$_{x}$O$_2$
Authors: Steven J. Gomez Alvarado, Brenden R. Ortiz, Soren Bear, Benito A. Gonzalez, Andrea N. Capa Salinas, Adam Berlie, Michael J. Graf, Stephen D. Wilson
Abstract: The delafossite-like compound NaYbO$_2$ hosts a triangular lattice of Yb$^{3+}$ moments and is a promising candidate for the realization of a quantum spin liquid ground state -- an exotic, quantum-disordered magnetic phase featuring long-range entanglement of spins. Tuning this system away from this quantum-disordered regime toward classical order or spin freezing is a powerful approach to shed light on the nature of the parent ground state. Here we leverage the substitution of nonmagnetic Lu$^{3+}$ onto the Yb$^{3+}$ sites to study the effects of magnetic disorder in NaYbO$_2$ using low-temperature ac susceptibility, heat capacity, and muon spin relaxation ($\mu$SR) measurements. Our $\mu$SR measurements reveal resilient, correlated magnetic fluctuations that persist to at least 15\% dilution, precluding conventional spin freezing and magnetic inhomogeneity. Heat capacity and magnetic susceptibility resolve a rapid suppression of the field-induced ``up-up-down'' magnetic order upon dilution and a crossover in the power-law behavior of the low-temperature magnetic excitations associated with the zero-field quantum disordered ground state. Taken together, these results support the notion of a robust network of entangled moments in NaYbO$_2$, and provides experimental validation of several models of a Heisenberg triangular lattice antiferromagnet in the presence of disorder.

Title: Temperature chaos as a logical consequence of the reentrant transition in spin glasses
Authors: Hidetoshi Nishimori, Masayuki Ohzeki, Manaka Okuyama
Abstract: Temperature chaos is a striking phenomenon in spin glasses, where even slight changes in temperature lead to a complete reconfiguration of the spin state. Another intriguing effect is the reentrant transition, in which lowering the temperature drives the system from a ferromagnetic phase into a less ordered spin-glass or paramagnetic phase. In the present paper, we reveal an unexpected connection between these seemingly unrelated phenomena in the finite-dimensional Edwards-Anderson model of spin glasses by introducing a generalized formulation that incorporates correlations among disorder variables. Assuming the existence of a spin glass phase at finite temperature, we establish that temperature chaos arises as a logical consequence of reentrance in the Edwards-Anderson model. Our findings uncover a previously hidden mathematical structure relating reentrance and temperature chaos, offering a new perspective on the physics of spin glasses beyond the mean-field theory.

Title: Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models
Authors: R. Moola, A. Mckenna, M. Hilke
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.

Title: Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice
Authors: M. R. Parymuda
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.

Title: Irreversibility in scalar active turbulence: The role of topological defects
Authors: Byjesh N. Radhakrishnan, Francesco Serafin, Thomas L. Schmidt, Étienne Fodor
Abstract: In many active systems, swimmers collectively stir the surrounding fluid to stabilize some self-sustained vortices. The resulting nonequilibrium state is often referred to as active turbulence, by analogy with the turbulence of passive fluids under external stirring. Although active turbulence clearly operates far from equilibrium, it can be challenging to pinpoint which emergent features primarily control the deviation from an equilibrium reversible dynamics. Here, we reveal that dynamical irreversibility essentially stems from singularities in the active stress. Specifically, considering the coupled dynamics of the swimmer density and the stream function, we demonstrate that the symmetries of vortical flows around defects determine the overall irreversibility. Our detailed analysis leads to identifying specific configurations of defect pairs as the dominant contribution to irreversibility.

Title: Reconciling Translational Invariance and Hierarchy
Authors: Olai B. Mykland, Zhao Zhang
Abstract: Tensor networks are not only numerical tools for describing ground states of quantum many-body systems, but also conceptual aids for understanding their entanglement structures. The proper way to understand tensor networks themselves is through explicit examples of solvable ground states that they represent exactly. In fact, this has historically been how tensor networks for gapped ground states, such as the matrix product state (MPS) and the projected entangled paired state (PEPS), emerged as an elegant analytical framework from numerical techniques like the density matrix renormalization group. However, for gapless ground states, generically described by the multiscale entanglement renormalization ansatz (MERA), a corresponding exactly solvable model has so far been missing. This is because the hierarchical structure of MERA intrinsically breaks the translational invariance. We identify a condition for MERA to be compatible with translational invariance by examining equivalent networks of rank-3 tensors. The condition is satisfied by the previously constructed hierarchical tensor network for the Motzkin and Fredkin chains, which can be considered a non-unitary generalization to the MERA. The hierarchical TN description is complemented by a translationally invariant MPS alternative, which is used to derive the power-law decay of the correlation function and critical exponents of a $q$-deformation phase transition.

Title: Flat-band thermodynamics reveals enhanced performance across Otto, Carnot, and Stirling cycles
Authors: Hadi Mohammed Soufy, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene (MATBG) exhibits remarkable electronic properties under external magnetic fields, notably the emergence of flat Landau levels. In this study, we present a comprehensive analysis of MATBG's operational phase diagram under three distinct quantum thermodynamic cycles, i.e., Quantum Otto Cycle (QOC), Quantum Carnot Cycle (QCC), and Quantum Stirling Cycle (QSC). Employing the continuum eight-band model, we evaluate the thermodynamic performance of MATBG across multiple operational modes: heat engine, refrigerator, cold pump, and Joule pump, and benchmark it against other graphene systems such as monolayer graphene, AB-Bernal stacked bilayer graphene, and non-magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene. Our findings reveal that MATBG demonstrates superior heat engine performance in QSC, while achieving high efficiency albeit with reduced work output in QOC. Even though the performance of MATBG as a cold pump or refrigerator is modest in QOC and QSC, it shows notable improvement as a refrigerator in QCC. Additionally, we identify a highly reversible Joule pump mode in both QSC and QOC under strict adiabaticity, underscoring the unique thermodynamic behavior of MATBG.

Title: Quantifying when hyperuniformity of a many-particle system leads to uniformity across length scales
Authors: Carlo Vanoni, Paul J. Steinhardt, Salvatore Torquato
Abstract: Hyperuniform systems are distinguished by an unusually strong suppression of large-scale density fluctuations and, consequently, display a high degree of uniformity at the largest length scales. In some cases, however, enhanced uniformity is expected to be present even at intermediate and possibly small length scales. There exist three different classes of hyperuniform systems, where class I and class III are the strongest and weakest forms, respectively. We utilize the local number variance $\sigma_N^2(R)$ associated with a window of radius $R$ as a diagnostic to quantify the approach to the asymptotic large-$R$ hyperuniform scaling of a variety of class I, II, and III systems. We find, for all class I systems we analyzed, including crystals, quasicrystals, disordered stealthy hyperuniform systems, and the one-component plasma, a faster approach to the asymptotic scaling of $\sigma_N^2(R)$, governed by corrections with integer powers of $1/R$. Thus, we conclude this represents the highest degree of effective uniformity from small to large length scales. Class II systems, such as Fermi-sphere point processes, are characterized by logarithmic $1/\ln(R)$ corrections and, consequently, a lower degree of local uniformity. Class III systems, such as perturbed lattice patterns, present an asymptotic scaling of $1/R^{\alpha}$, $0 < \alpha < 1$, implying, curiously, an intermediate degree of local uniformity. In addition, our study provides insight into when experimental and numerical finite systems are representative of large-scale behavior. Our findings may thereby facilitate the design of hyperuniform systems with enhanced physical properties arising from local uniformity.

Title: Mesoscale variations of chemical and electronic landscape on the surface of Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ visualized by ARPES and XPS

Abstract: The multiple crystalline terminations in magnetic Weyl semimetal Co$_3$Sn$_2$S$_2$ display distinct topological and trivial surface states, which have successfully been distinguished experimentally. However, a model of pure terminations is known to be inadequate because these surfaces exhibit a high degree of spatial heterogeneity and point disorder. Here we perform a spectromicroscopy study of the surface chemistry and surface electronic structure using photoemission measurements in combination with first-principles calculations of core levels. We identify an intermediate region with properties distinct from both the sulfur and tin terminations, and demonstrate that the spectral features in this region can be associated with a disordered termination with a varying density of surface tin vacancies. This work establishes heuristics for identifying variable surface disorder using photoemission, an important prerequisite to experimentally establishing the behavior of momentum-space topological surface features subject to variable surface disorder on a single cleave.

Title: Evanescent random walker on networks: Hitting times, budget renewal, and survival dynamics
Authors: Thomas M. Michelitsch, Alejandro P. Riascos
Abstract: We consider a mortal random walker evolving with discrete time on a network, where transitions follow a degree-biased Markovian navigation strategy. The walker starts with a random initial budget $T_1 \in \mathbb{N}$ and must maintain a strictly positive budget to remain alive. Each step incurs a unit cost, decrementing the budget by one; the walker perishes (is ruined) upon depletion of the budget. However, when the walker reaches designated target nodes, the budget is renewed by an independent and identically distributed (IID) copy of its initial value. The degree bias is tuned to either favor or disfavor visits to these target nodes. Our model exhibits connections with stochastic resetting. The evolution of the budget can be interpreted as a deterministic drift on the integer line toward negative values, where the walker is intermittently reset to positive IID random positions and dies at the first hit of the origin. The first part of the paper focuses on the target-hitting statistics of an immortal Markovian walker. We analyze the \textit{target hitting counting process} (THCP) for an arbitrary set of target nodes. Within this framework, the second part of the paper addresses the dynamics of the evanescent walker. We derive analytical results for arbitrary configurations of target nodes, including the evanescent propagator matrix, the survival probability, the mean residence time on a set of nodes during the walker's lifetime, and the expected lifetime itself. Additionally, we compute the expected number of target hits (i.e., budget renewals) in a lifetime of the walker and related distributions. We explore both analytically and numerically various scenarios affecting the life expectancy of the walker.

Title: Integrability from a Single Conservation Law in Quantum Spin Chains
Authors: Akihiro Hokkyo
Abstract: We prove that for quantum spin chains with finite-range interactions, the existence of a specific conservation law known as the Reshetikhin condition implies the presence of infinitely many local conserved quantities, i.e., integrability. This shows that the entire hierarchy of conservation laws associated with solutions of the Yang--Baxter equation is already encoded in the lowest nontrivial conservation law. Combined with recent rigorous results on nonintegrability, our theorem strongly restricts the possibility of partially integrable systems that admit only a finite but large number of local conserved quantities. Our work establishes a rigorous foundation for the systematic identification of new integrable models and deepens the algebraic understanding of conservation-law structures in quantum spin chains.

Title: Optical Voltammetry of redox processes inside a nanohole with Opto-iontronic microscopy
Authors: Zhu Zhang, Haolan Tao, Cheng Lian, René van Roij, Sanli Faez
Abstract: Cyclic Voltammetry (CV) is the most commonly used method in electrochemistry to characterize electrochemical reactions, usually involving macroscopic electrodes. Here we demonstrate a novel optical CV technique called Opto-iontronic Microscopy, which is capable of monitoring electrochemical processes at the nanoscale. By integrating optical microscopy with nanohole electrodes, we enhance sensitivity in detecting redox reactions within volumes as small as an attoliter ($(100 \text{~nm})^{3}$). This technique uses total internal reflection (TIR) illumination, Electric-double-layer modulation, cyclic voltammetry, and lock-in detection, to probe ion dynamics inside nanoholes. We applied this method to study EDL (dis)charging coupled to ferrocenedimethanol (Fc(MeOH)$_2$) redox reactions. Experimental results were validated against a theoretical Poisson-Nernst-Planck-Butler-Volmer (PNP-BV) model, providing insights into ion concentration changes of reaction species that contribute to the optical contrast. This work opens up opportunities for high-sensitivity, label-free analysis of electrochemical reactions in nanoconfined environments, with potential applications in pure nanocrystal growth and monitoring, and potentially single-molecule electrochemistry.

Title: Local structural disorder in crystalline materials
Authors: Marios Zacharias, Jacky Even
Abstract: Local positional disorder in soft, anharmonic materials has emerged as a central factor in shaping their electronic, vibrational, optical, and transport properties. Viewed mainly as a source of performance degradation, recent theoretical insights reveal that local disorder profoundly influences the electronic structure and phonon dynamics, without inducing deep electronic traps or non-radiative recombination pathways. In this work, we highlight advances in modeling local disorder using polymorphous and anharmonic frameworks, showing how these methods explain experimental observations and predict new trends. We emphasize the role of disorder in the breakdown of the phonon quasiparticle picture and in modulating electron-phonon and phonon-phonon interactions, particularly in soft, anharmonic phases of matter, with significant effects on electrical and thermal transport. We outline opportunities for integrating these insights into predictive modeling for energy materials and propose combining advanced first-principles methods with machine learning.

Title: Supervised and Unsupervised Deep Learning Applied to the Majority Vote Model
Authors: J. F. Silva Neto, D. S. M. Alencar, L. T. Brito, G. A. Alves, F. W. S. Lima, A. Macedo-Filho, R. S. Ferreira, T. F. A. Alves
Abstract: We employ deep learning techniques to investigate the critical properties of the continuous phase transition in the majority vote model. In addition to deep learning, principal component analysis is utilized to analyze the transition. For supervised learning, dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via the kinetic Monte Carlo method. Using independently simulated configuration data, the neural network accurately identifies the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and enables estimation of critical exponents, typically obtained via Monte Carlo importance sampling. Furthermore, deep unsupervised learning is performed using variational autoencoders, which reconstruct input spin configurations and generate artificial outputs. The autoencoders detect the phase transition through the loss function, quantifying the preservation of essential data features. We define a correlation function between the real and reconstructed data, and find that this correlation function is universal at the critical point. Variational autoencoders also serve as generative models, producing artificial spin configurations.

Title: A follow-up on the sulphur atom popping model for MoS$_2$ memristor
Authors: Sanchali Mitra, Santanu Mahapatra
Abstract: The mechanism of resistive switching in two-dimensional (2D) semiconductor-based memristors is intriguing, and our conventional knowledge of bulk-oxide based memristors does not apply to these devices. Experimental data indicate that the genesis of resistive switching may be intrinsic to the 2D semiconducting active layer, as well as resulting from the movement of electrode atoms. Employing reactive-force field (ReaxFF) molecular dynamics simulations, we introduced the "sulphur atom popping model" [npj 2D Mater. Appl. 5, 33 (2021)] to elucidate the intrinsic nature of non-volatile resistive switching in 2D molybdenum disulfide-based memristors. In this paper we provide additional perspective to this model using density functional theory. We also discuss the limitations of universal machine learning interatomic potentials in reproducing ReaxFF simulation results.

Title: Orbital altermagnetism on the kagome lattice and possible application to $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Anzumaan R. Chakraborty, Fan Yang, Turan Birol, Rafael M. Fernandes
Abstract: Altermagnets, which encompass a broad landscape of materials, are compensated collinear magnetic phases in which the antiparallel magnetic moments are related by a crystalline rotation. Here, we argue that collinear altermagnetic-like states can also be realized in lattices with an odd number of sublattices, provided that the electronic interactions promote non-uniform magnetic moments. We demonstrate this idea for a kagome metal whose band filling places the Fermi level close to the van Hove singularity. Combining phenomenological and microscopic modeling, we show that the intertwined charge density-wave and loop-current instabilities of this model lead to a wide parameter range in which orbital ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, and altermagnetic phases emerge inside the charge-ordered state. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling, their electronic structures display the usual spin-split fingerprints associated with the three types of collinear magnetic order. We discuss the possible realization of orbital altermagnetic phases in the $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ family of kagome metals.

Title: Exact Quench Dynamics from Thermal Pure Quantum States
Authors: Hui-Huang Chen
Abstract: We present an exact solution for the real-time dynamics following a quench from a thermal pure quantum (TPQ) state in an integrable system. Although equilibration is expected in this setting because the TPQ state already encodes the thermal expectation values of all conserved quantities, the approach to equilibrium shows highly nontrivial coherent dynamics. In the spin-1/2 XX chain, local observables become stationary at their thermal values after dephasing, while the entanglement entropy exhibits a characteristic double-plateau structure. We obtain this behavior exactly using three complementary approaches: two-dimensional (2D) conformal field theory (CFT) on the Klein bottle, an exact numerical evolution based on the matrix Riccati equation, and an asymptotically exact quasiparticle picture. These results demonstrate that the non-monotonic entanglement evolution is a macroscopic manifestation of the coherent dephasing of anomalous pairing correlations in the initial TPQ state.

Title: Retardance of lab grown diamond substrates as a function of thickness: momentum-drift random walk model
Authors: Thanh Tran, Phuong Vo, Thomas Sheppard, Timothy Grotjohn, Paul Quayle
Abstract: This work studies the correlation between mean retardance and thickness of diamond substrates grown homoepitaxially via microwave plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (MPCVD). We measure the retardance of a diamond substrate in two orientations: perpendicular and parallel to the growth direction. Our experimental results demonstrate that the correlation between mean retardance and thickness differs for these orientations. When measured perpendicular to the growth direction, the mean retardance is approximately proportional to the square root of the substrate thickness. In contrast, when measured parallel to the growth direction, we observe a generally higher mean retardance and an approximately linear correlation with thickness. This anisotropy arises not from differences in stress magnitude but from differences in the interlayer correlation of the principal stress axes, as evidenced by correlation coefficients between the azimuth angles of consecutive layers in the diamond crystal. To simulate the integrated retardance of diamond wafers, we propose a two-dimensional random walk model with momentum drift, which captures the diamond crystal tendency to preserve the azimuth angle across the samples. By optimizing the momentum factor, we show that the model can closely match experimental data. The momentum factor is found higher along the growth direction, which is consistent with the calculated correlation coefficients. Furthermore, both the model and experiments indicate that retardance-to-thickness ratios of thin samples converge toward similar base retardances in both orientations. These findings establish a quantitative framework for interpreting birefringence in diamond substrates, with implications for material selection and development in thermal management, quantum sensing, high-power electronics, and optical applications.

Abstract: We investigate the critical properties of kinetic continuous opinion dynamics using deep learning techniques. The system consists of $N$ continuous spin variables in the interval $[-1,1]$. Dense neural networks are trained on spin configuration data generated via kinetic Monte Carlo simulations, accurately identifying the critical point on both square and triangular lattices. Classical unsupervised learning with principal component analysis reproduces the magnetization and allows estimation of critical exponents. Additionally, variational autoencoders are implemented to study the phase transition through the loss function, which behaves as an order parameter. A correlation function between real and reconstructed data is defined and found to be universal at the critical point.

Title: Raman Digital Twin of Monolayer Janus Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Johnathan Kowalski, Liangbo Liang
Abstract: Monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) are a key class of two-dimensional (2D) materials with broad technological potential. Their Janus counterparts exhibit unique properties due to broken out-of-plane symmetry and further enrich the functionalities of TMDs. However, experimental synthesis and identification of Janus TMDs remain challenging. It is thus highly desirable to have a rapid, simple, and in situ characterization technique to monitor, in real time, the conversion process from the parent to Janus structure. Raman spectroscopy stands out for such a task as it is a powerful, non-destructive, and very commonly used tool to characterize 2D materials both in situ and ex situ. To realize the full potential of Raman spectroscopy on rapid characterization of Janus TMDs, we present a computational "Raman digital twin" library for various monolayer Janus TMDs in both 2H and Td phases. We focus on group-6 TMDs: MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoTe$_2$, WTe$_2$ and their Janus variants: MoSSe, MoSTe, MoSeTe, WSSe, WSTe, and WSeTe. Using first-principles density functional theory (DFT), we calculate their vibrational properties and predict distinct Raman fingerprints. These phonon and Raman signatures reflect each material's structural symmetry and atomic composition, enabling clear identification via Raman spectroscopy. Our theoretical work supports experimental efforts by providing benchmarks for material identification, structural analysis, and quality control. The computational library expedites the discovery and development of Janus 2D materials, facilitating tighter integration between theoretical predictions and experimental validation.

Title: Two-Dimensional Na2LiAlP2 Crystal for High-Performance Field-Effect Transistors
Authors: Run-Jie Peng, Xing-Yu Wang, Jun-Hui Yuan, Nian-Nian Yu, Kan-Hao Xue, Jiafu Wang, Pan Zhang
Abstract: High-performance, low-power transistors are core components of advanced integrated circuits, and the ultimate limitation of Moore's law has made the search for new alternative pathways an urgent priority. Two-dimensional (2D) materials have become the most promising exploration target due to their exceptional electronic properties and scalability. In this work, we conducted device transport research on the previously proposed 2D quaternary semiconductor Na2LiAlP2 using the non-equilibrium Green's function method. The results demonstrate that even with a channel length of 5 nm, Na2LiAlP2 still exhibits excellent n-type transistor characteristics, fully meeting and surpassing the technical specifications outlined in the International Roadmap for Devices and Systems (IRDS). Encouragingly, the device can easily achieve the required on-state current of 900 {\mu}A/{\mu}m under low operating voltages of 0.1 V and 0.2 V. Moreover, at 0.1 V operating voltage, the device's subthreshold swing breaks through the theoretical limit of 60 mV/dec, reaching an astonishing value 30.33 mV/dec. Additionally, its p-type transistor performance also stands out with a subthreshold swing of ~50 mV/dec when the channel length is 7 nm. Our research not only showcases the exceptional transistor properties of Na2LiAlP2 but also further expands the research scope of 2D high-performance transistors.

Title: Mapping Temperature Using Transmission Kikuchi Diffraction
Authors: Yueyun Chen, Xin Yi Ling, Jared Lodico, Tristan P. O`Neill, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg
Abstract: Electronic devices are engineered at increasingly smaller length scales; new metrologies to understand nanoscale thermodynamics are needed. Temperature and pressure are fundamental thermodynamic quantities whose nanoscale measurement is challenging as physical contact inevitably perturbs the system. Here we demonstrate Kikuchi diffraction thermometry (KDTh), a non-contact scanning electron microscope (SEM) technique capable of mapping nanoscale temperatures and pressures. KDTh detects local volumetric lattice changes in crystalline samples by precisely fitting Kikuchi patterns. Temperature changes are deduced using the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE). We map lattice parameters and temperatures on Joule-heated graphite by rastering a 5.5-nm electron probe across the sample. Our parameter precision is ~0.01% and our temperature sensitivity is 2.2 K/$\sqrt{Hz}$. KDTh offers advanced sensitivity by fitting the entire Kikuchi pattern, even beyond the precision measured in transmission electron microscopy. KDTh can operate in both transmission (transmission Kikuchi diffraction, TKD) and reflection (electron backscatter diffraction, EBSD) modes.

Title: Self-Organization and Cyclic Positioning of Active Condensates
Authors: Hossein Vahid, Jens-Uwe Sommer, Abhinav Sharma
Abstract: Active transport of biomolecular condensates and cell migration in collectives are fundamental to development, homeostasis, and processes such as cancer progression, wound healing, and infection response. Yet how these assemblies are positioned, regulated, and driven through cycles of dissolution and reassembly is not fully understood. We address this using a model of attractive active Brownian particles (ABPs). Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we show that these particles undergo liquid-gas phase separation, and spatially varying activity fields induce striking emergent dynamics. Droplets migrate up activity gradients, and above a critical activity, they fragment into a gas phase. The gas then migrates down the gradient, and droplets reassemble, yielding robust positioning cycles. This emergent condensate cycle arises without biochemical feedback loops and relies only on the interplay of attractions, motility, and gradients. In binary mixtures of active-passive particles, differential cohesion leads to self-sorting of particles, where strongly-cohesive ABPs compact into dense cores surrounded by peripheries enriched with weakly-cohesive passive particles. The passive particles stabilize the dynamic clusters of ABPs, and they migrate toward high-activity regions. Our findings suggest a generic mechanism for spatial control and turnover of condensates in biology.

Title: iDART: Interferometric Dual-AC Resonance Tracking nano-electromechanical mapping
Authors: J. Bemis, F. Wunderwald, U. Schroeder, X. Xu, A. Gruverman, R. Proksch
Abstract: Piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) has established itself as a very successful and reliable imaging and spectroscopic tool for measuring a wide variety of nanoscale electromechanical functionalities. Quantitative imaging of nanoscale electromechanical phenomena requires high sensitivity while avoiding artifacts induced by large drive biases. Conventional PFM often relies on high voltages to overcome optical detection noise, leading to various non-ideal effects including electrostatic crosstalk, Joule heating, and tip-induced switching. To mitigate this situation, we introduce interferometrically detected, resonance-enhanced dual AC resonance tracking (iDART), which combines femtometer-scale displacement sensitivity of quadrature phase differential interferometry with contact resonance amplification. Through this combination, iDART achieves 10x or greater signal-to-noise improvement over current state of the art PFM approaches including both single frequency interferometric PFM or conventional, resonance enhanced PFM using optical beam detection. In this work, we demonstrate a >10x improvement of imaging sensitivity on PZT and Y-HfO. Switching spectroscopy shows similar improvements, where further demonstrates reliable hysteresis loops at small biases, mitigating nonlinearities and device failures that can occur at higher excitation amplitudes. These results position iDART as a powerful approach for probing conventional ferroelectrics with extremely high signal to noise down to weak piezoelectric systems, extending functional imaging capabilities to thin films, 2D ferroelectrics, beyond-CMOS technologies and bio-materials.

Title: Relation between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antenna complex of green sulfur bacteria: efficiency under natural sunlight pumping
Authors: Alessia Valzelli, Francesco Mattiotti, Jianshu Cao, G. Luca Celardo
Abstract: Large-scale simulations of light-matter interaction in natural photosynthetic antenna complexes of the Chlorobium Tepidum green sulfur bacteria (GSB) containing more than one hundred thousand chlorophyll molecules, comparable with natural size, have been performed. Here we have modeled the entire process of the exciton energy transfer, from sunlight absorption to exciton trapping in the reaction centers (RCs) in presence of a thermal bath. The energy transfer has been analyzed using the radiative non-Hermitian Hamiltonian and solving the rate equations for the populations. Sunlight pumping has been modeled as black-body radiation with an attenuation factor that takes the Sun-Earth distance into account. Cylindrical structures typical of GSB antenna complexes, and the dimeric baseplate comparable to natural size have been considered. Our analysis shows that under natural sunlight, in photosynthetic antennae of GSB the number of excitations reaching the RC per unit time matches the RC closure rate and the internal efficiency shows values close to 80%. We also considered cylindrical structures where the orientation of the dipoles does not reflect the natural one. Specifically, we vary continuously the angle of the transition dipole with respect to the cylinder main axis, focusing on the case where all dipoles are parallel to the cylinder axis. We also consider the important case where the dipoles are randomly oriented. In all cases the light-harvesting efficiency is lower than in the natural structure, showing the high sensitivity of light harvesting to the specific orientation of the dipole moments. Our results allow for a better understanding of the relationship between structure and functionality in photosynthetic antennae of GSB and could drive the design of efficient light-harvesting devices.

Title: Energy-based opinion on the correlation between stress drop and rupture speed
Authors: Shiqing Xu
Abstract: Stress drop $\Delta\tau$ and rupture speed $V_r$ are two important earthquake source parameters that control the characteristics of rupture process and the associated ground motion. However, how the two parameters correlate with one another is not fully clear and sometimes can be controversial. Here I propose using the energy balance relation derived from fracture mechanics to understand the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. The central idea is to explore the balance between fracture energy $G_c$ and dynamic energy release rate $G_d$ (which itself is a function of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$) under various conditions of $G_c$. Using averaged values of $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ for comparison, it is shown that near constant $G_c$ can yield a positive correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$, whereas variable $G_c$ dependent on space, time or other factors may cause a negative correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. These results suggest a need to examine the condition of other factors (such as $G_c$) when evaluating the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$. Extra issues can complicate the evaluation of the correlation between $\Delta\tau$ and $V_r$ when rupture process is inferred from far-field observations, accompanied by strong spatiotemporal variation, or followed by additional phases, which should be investigated by future studies.

Title: Clustering of conditional mutual information and quantum Markov structure at arbitrary temperatures
Authors: Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: Recent investigations have unveiled exotic quantum phases that elude characterization by simple bipartite correlation functions. In these phases, long-range entanglement arising from tripartite correlations plays a central role. Consequently, the study of multipartite correlations has become a focal point in modern physics. In these, Conditional Mutual Information (CMI) is one of the most well-established information-theoretic measures, adept at encapsulating the essence of various exotic phases, including topologically ordered ones. Within the realm of quantum many-body physics, it has been a long-sought goal to establish a quantum analog to the Hammersley--Clifford theorem that bridges the two concepts of the Gibbs state and the Markov network. This theorem posits that the correlation length of CMI remains short-range across all thermal equilibrium quantum phases. In this work, we demonstrate that CMI exhibits exponential decay with respect to distance, with its correlation length increasing polynomially with respect to the inverse temperature. While this clustering theorem has previously been believed to hold for high temperatures devoid of thermal phase transitions, it has remained elusive at low temperatures, where genuine long-range entanglement can exist due to the quantum topological order. Our findings unveil that, even at low temperatures, a broad class of tripartite entanglement cannot manifest in the long-range regime. To achieve the proof, we establish a comprehensive formalism for analyzing the locality of effective Hamiltonians on subsystems, commonly known as the entanglement Hamiltonian or Hamiltonian of mean force. As an outcome of our analyses, we improve the prior clustering theorem for bipartite entanglement. In essence, this means that we investigate genuine bipartite entanglement that extends beyond the limitations of the Positive Partial Transpose (PPT) class.

Title: Estimating time in quantum chaotic systems and black holes
Authors: Haifeng Tang, Shreya Vardhan, Jinzhao Wang
Abstract: We characterize new universal features of the dynamics of chaotic quantum many-body systems, by considering a hypothetical task of "time estimation." Most macroscopic observables in a chaotic system equilibrate to nearly constant late-time values. Intuitively, it should become increasingly difficult to estimate the precise value of time by making measurements on the state. We use a quantity called the Fisher information from quantum metrology to quantify the minimum uncertainty in estimating time. Due to unitarity, the uncertainty in the time estimate does not grow with time if we have access to optimal measurements on the full system. Restricting the measurements to act on a small subsystem or to have low computational complexity leads to results expected from equilibration, where the time uncertainty becomes large at late times. With optimal measurements on a subsystem larger than half of the system, we regain the ability to estimate the time very precisely, even at late times. Hawking's calculation for the reduced density matrix of the black hole radiation in semiclassical gravity contradicts our general predictions for unitary quantum chaotic systems. Hawking's state always has a large uncertainty for attempts to estimate the time using the radiation, whereas our general results imply that the uncertainty should become small after the Page time. This gives a new version of the black hole information loss paradox in terms of the time estimation task. By restricting to simple measurements on the radiation, the time uncertainty becomes large. This indicates from a new perspective that the observations of computationally bounded agents are consistent with the semiclassical effective description of gravity.

Title: The surface code beyond Pauli channels: Logical noise coherence, information-theoretic measures, and errorfield-double phenomenology
Authors: Jan Behrends, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: We consider the surface code under errors featuring both coherent and incoherent components and study the coherence of the corresponding logical noise channel and how this impacts information-theoretic measures of code performance, namely coherent information and quantum relative entropy. Using numerical simulations and developing a phenomenological field theory, focusing on the most general single-qubit X-error channel, we show that, for any nonzero incoherent noise component, the coherence of the logical noise is exponentially suppressed with the code distance. We also find that the information-theoretic measures require this suppression to detect optimal thresholds for Pauli recovery; for this they thus require increasingly large distances for increasing error coherence and ultimately break down for fully coherent errors. To obtain our results, we develop a statistical mechanics mapping and a corresponding matrix-product-state algorithm for approximate syndrome sampling. These methods enable the large scale simulation of these non-Pauli errors, including their maximum-likelihood thresholds, away from the limits captured by previous approaches.

Title: Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction
Authors: Ying-Ting Yeh, Janghoon Ock, Achuth Chandrasekhar, Shagun Maheshwari, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: We investigate transformer-based language models, including RoBERTa, T5, Llama-3, and MatSciBERT, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual descriptions. The inputs encode key material features, such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, and other structural and electronic properties. Unlike shallow machine learning models, which require extensive feature engineering, or Graph Neural Networks, which rely on graph representations derived from atomic coordinates, pretrained language models can process textual inputs directly, eliminating the need for manual feature preprocessing or structure-based encoding. Material descriptions were constructed in two formats: structured strings with a consistent template and natural language narratives generated via the ChatGPT API. Each model was augmented with a custom regression head and finetuned for band gap prediction task. Language models of different architectures and parameter sizes were all able to predict band gaps from human-readable text with strong accuracy, achieving MAEs in the range of 0.25-0.33 eV, highlighting the success of this approach for scientific regression tasks. Finetuned Llama-3, with 1.2 billion parameters, achieved the highest accuracy (MAE 0.248 eV, R2 0.891). MatSciBERT, pretrained on materials science literature, reached comparable performance (MAE 0.288 eV, R2 0.871) with significantly fewer parameters (110 million), emphasizing the importance of domain-specific pretraining. Attention analysis shows that both models selectively focus on compositional and spin-related features while de-emphasizing geometric features, reflecting the difficulty of capturing spatial information from text. These results establish that pretrained language models can effectively extract complex feature-property relationships from textual material descriptions.

Title: The category of anyon sectors for non-abelian quantum double models
Authors: Alex Bols, Mahdie Hamdan, Pieter Naaijkens, Siddharth Vadnerkar
Abstract: We study Kitaev's quantum double model for arbitrary finite gauge group in infinite volume, using an operator-algebraic approach. The quantum double model hosts anyonic excitations which can be identified with equivalence classes of `localized and transportable endomorphisms', which produce anyonic excitations from the ground state. Following the Doplicher--Haag--Roberts (DHR) sector theory from AQFT, we organize these endomorphisms into a braided monoidal category capturing the fusion and braiding properties of the anyons. We show that this category is equivalent to $\mathrm{Rep}_f \mathcal{D}(G)$, the representation category of the quantum double of $G$. This establishes for the first time the full DHR structure for a class of 2d quantum lattice models with non-abelian anyons.

Title: Exploring the Energy Landscape of RBMs: Reciprocal Space Insights into Bosons, Hierarchical Learning and Symmetry Breaking
Authors: J. Quetzalcóatl Toledo-Marin, Anindita Maiti, Geoffrey C. Fox, Roger G. Melko
Abstract: Deep generative models have become ubiquitous due to their ability to learn and sample from complex distributions. Despite the proliferation of various frameworks, the relationships among these models remain largely unexplored, a gap that hinders the development of a unified theory of AI learning. We address two central challenges: clarifying the connections between different deep generative models and deepening our understanding of their learning mechanisms. We focus on Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs), known for their universal approximation capabilities for discrete distributions. By introducing a reciprocal space formulation, we reveal a connection between RBMs, diffusion processes, and coupled Bosons. We show that at initialization, the RBM operates at a saddle point, where the local curvature is determined by the singular values, whose distribution follows the Marcenko-Pastur law and exhibits rotational symmetry. During training, this rotational symmetry is broken due to hierarchical learning, where different degrees of freedom progressively capture features at multiple levels of abstraction. This leads to a symmetry breaking in the energy landscape, reminiscent of Landau theory. This symmetry breaking in the energy landscape is characterized by the singular values and the weight matrix eigenvector matrix. We derive the corresponding free energy in a mean-field approximation. We show that in the limit of infinite size RBM, the reciprocal variables are Gaussian distributed. Our findings indicate that in this regime, there will be some modes for which the diffusion process will not converge to the Boltzmann distribution. To illustrate our results, we trained replicas of RBMs with different hidden layer sizes using the MNIST dataset. Our findings bridge the gap between disparate generative frameworks and also shed light on the processes underpinning learning in generative models.

Title: The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS
Authors: Tiago V. Fernandes, Francisco J. Gandum, José P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.

Title: The Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-quantum electrodynamics
Authors: M. J. Neves
Abstract: The Lee-Wick pseudo-quantum electrodynamics in the presence of a Chern-Simons term is studied in this paper. The paper starts with a non-local lagrangian density that sets the pseudo-Lee-Wick electrodynamics defined on a $1+2$ space-time added to a Chern-Simons topological term. We investigate classical aspects as the potential energy for the interaction of static charges through the gauge propagator. The causality of theory is discussed through the retarded Green function in the coordinate space. The gauge field of the Lee-Wick-Chern-Simons pseudo-electrodynamics is minimally coupled to the fermions sector that includes new degree of freedoms, as a Lee-Wick heavy fermion partner of the electron. The perturbative approach for the theory is presented via effective action in which we obtain the Ward identities. We study the radiative corrections at one loop, as the electron self-energy, the vacuum polarization, and the $3$-vertex. We show that the Lee-Wick mass has a fundamental role in these results, where it works like a natural regulator of the ultraviolet divergences. The $g-2$ factor for the electron is obtained as function of the LW mass, and of the CS parameter. Through the optical theorem, the theory is unitary at the tree level.

Title: Mixed Quantum-Classical Methods for Polaron Spectral Functions
Authors: Haimi Nguyen, Arkajit Mandal, Ankit Mahajan, David R. Reichman
Abstract: In this work, using two distinct semiclassical approaches, namely the mean-field Ehrenfest (MFE) method and the mapping approach to surface hopping (MASH), we investigate the spectral function of a single charge interacting with phonons on a lattice. This quantity is relevant for the description of angle-resolved photoemission experiments. Focusing on the one-dimensional Holstein model, we compare the performance of these approaches across a range of coupling strengths and lattice sizes, exposing the relative strengths and weaknesses of each. We demonstrate that these approaches can be efficiently applied with reasonable accuracy to ab initio polaron models. Our work provides a route to the calculation of spectral properties in realistic electron-phonon-coupled systems in a computationally inexpensive manner with encouraging accuracy.

Title: On the Emergence of Linear Analogies in Word Embeddings
Authors: Daniel J. Korchinski, Dhruva Karkada, Yasaman Bahri, Matthieu Wyart
Abstract: Models such as Word2Vec and GloVe construct word embeddings based on the co-occurrence probability $P(i,j)$ of words $i$ and $j$ in text corpora. The resulting vectors $W_i$ not only group semantically similar words but also exhibit a striking linear analogy structure -- for example, $W_{\text{king}} - W_{\text{man}} + W_{\text{woman}} \approx W_{\text{queen}}$ -- whose theoretical origin remains unclear. Previous observations indicate that this analogy structure: (i) already emerges in the top eigenvectors of the matrix $M(i,j) = P(i,j)/P(i)P(j)$, (ii) strengthens and then saturates as more eigenvectors of $M (i, j)$, which controls the dimension of the embeddings, are included, (iii) is enhanced when using $\log M(i,j)$ rather than $M(i,j)$, and (iv) persists even when all word pairs involved in a specific analogy relation (e.g., king-queen, man-woman) are removed from the corpus. To explain these phenomena, we introduce a theoretical generative model in which words are defined by binary semantic attributes, and co-occurrence probabilities are derived from attribute-based interactions. This model analytically reproduces the emergence of linear analogy structure and naturally accounts for properties (i)-(iv). It can be viewed as giving fine-grained resolution into the role of each additional embedding dimension. It is robust to various forms of noise and agrees well with co-occurrence statistics measured on Wikipedia and the analogy benchmark introduced by Mikolov et al.

Title: Unifying same- and different-material particle charging through stochastic scaling
Authors: Holger Grosshans, Gizem Ozler, Simon Jantač
Abstract: Triboelectric charging of insulating particles through contact is critical in diverse physical and engineering processes, from dust storms and volcanic eruptions to industrial powder handling. However, many experiments over the years have consistently revealed counterintuitive charging patterns, including variable impact charge under identical conditions, charge sign reversal with repeated impacts, and bipolar charging of differently sized particles. Existing computational models cannot predict these patterns; they either rely on oversimplified heuristics or require inaccessible detailed surface properties. We present a stochastic scaling model (SSM) for particle charging that unifies same-material (particle-particle) and different-material (particle-wall) charging in a single theoretical framework. The model grounds in a physics-based stochastic closure by the mean, variance, skewness, and minimum impact charge measured in a highly-controlled reference experiment. To test the SSM, we implemented it in an open-source Lagrangian-Eulerian CFD solver. When simulating 300 000 insulating particles transported by turbulent wall-bounded flows, the SSM takes less than 0.01% of the CPU time. By scaling the statistical parameters of the reference impact to each collision, the new model reproduces the complex charging patterns observed in experiments without requiring surface-level first-principles inputs. The SSM offers a physically grounded route to large-scale simulations of electrostatic effects across many fields of particle-laden flows.

Title: Beyond Entanglement: Diagnosing quantum mediator dynamics in gravitationally mediated experiments
Authors: P. George Christopher, S. Shankaranarayanan (IIT Bombay)
Abstract: No experimental test to date has provided conclusive evidence on the quantum nature of gravity. Recent proposals, such as the BMV experiment, suggest that generating entanglement could serve as a direct test. Motivated by these proposals, we study a system of three-harmonic oscillator system, with the mediator oscillator operating in two distinct parameter regimes: a heavy mediator regime and a light mediator regime. These regimes induce qualitatively different entanglement dynamics between the terminal oscillators. Crucially, distinguishing these regimes experimentally remains challenging when relying solely on entanglement measures. We demonstrate that the dynamical fidelity susceptibility offers a viable and sensitive probe to contrast the regimes in practice. Our results provide testable signatures for optomechanical and trapped-ion platforms simulating gravitational interactions, and provide new avenues to characterize quantum-gravity-inspired systems beyond entanglement-based protocols.

Title: Self-Enhancing Halite Growth Creates Secondary Porous Networks During CO2 Storage in Saline Aquifers
Authors: Mohammad Nooraiepour, Mohammad Masoudi, Hannelore Derluyn, Pascale Senechal, Peter Moonen, Helge Hellevang
Abstract: Salt precipitation during CO2 injection into saline aquifers obstructs flow-controlling pore throats and reduces permeability, yet reactive transport models assume salt forms dispersed, non-porous crystals with minimal flow impact. We demonstrate that halite instead creates three-dimensional porous networks with 40% internal porosity through self-enhancing growth mechanisms absent from current models. Time-lapse X-ray micro-computed tomography and spectral imaging reveal preferential nucleation at gas-liquid interfaces, where porous hydrophilic aggregates generate capillary suction that draws brine films toward precipitation sites, accelerating growth and expanding reactive surface area in a positive feedback loop. Spectral tomography shows systematic density gradients reflecting two-stage precipitation: dense macrocrystalline cores formed under moderate supersaturation and evaporation, surrounded by microcrystalline overgrowths from rapid late-stage dynamics. These overgrowths create umbrella-like crusts that encapsulate residual brine beneath surface layers. This porous architecture explains why modest porosity reduction causes severe permeability decline, as aggregates preferentially obstruct flow percolation pathways rather than uniformly cementing grains or filling pore space. Five interconnected mechanisms drive self-enhancing growth across nano- to centimeter scales: interface nucleation, secondary porous structure formation, steep concentration gradients, hydrophilic substrate film maintenance, and capillary-driven solute delivery. Our quantitative characterization of internal salt architecture, reactive surface areas, and pore connectivity provides essential parameters for improving predictive models of evaporation-precipitation dynamics in carbon storage, soil salinization, and cultural heritage preservation.

Title: Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states
Authors: Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computations of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional), and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.

Title: Criticality in 1-dimensional field theories with mesoscopic, infinite range interactions
Authors: Kurt Langfeld, Amanda Turner
Abstract: The study of critical phenomena in one-dimensional field theories with long-range interactions has garnered significant attention following the implications of the Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem, which precludes phase transitions in most low-dimensional theories with local interactions. This research investigates a novel class of one-dimensional theories characterised by a distinctly defined infinite interaction range. We propose that such theories emerge naturally through a meso- scopic feedback mechanism. In this proof-of-concept study, we examine Ising-type models and a model with continuous O(3) symmetry, and demonstrate that the natural emergence of phase transitions, criticality, spontaneous symmetry breaking and previously unidentified universality classes is evident.

Title: Spectral Small-Incremental-Entangling: Breaking Quasi-Polynomial Complexity Barriers in Long-Range Interacting Systems
Authors: Donghoon Kim, Yusuke Kimura, Hugo Mackay, Yosuke Mitsuhashi, Hideaki Nishikawa, Carla Rubiliani, Cheng Shang, Ayumi Ukai, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: How the detailed structure of quantum complexity emerges from quantum dynamics remains a fundamental challenge highlighted by advances in quantum simulators and information processing. The celebrated Small-Incremental-Entangling (SIE) theorem provides a universal constraint on the rate of entanglement generation, yet it leaves open the problem of fully characterizing fine entanglement structures. Here we introduce the concept of Spectral-Entangling strength, which captures the structural entangling power of an operator, and establish a spectral SIE theorem: a universal speed limit for R'enyi entanglement growth at $\alpha \ge 1/2$, revealing a robust $1/s^2$ decay threshold in the entanglement spectrum. Remarkably, our bound at $\alpha=1/2$ is both qualitatively and quantitatively optimal, defining the universal threshold beyond which entanglement growth becomes unbounded. This exposes the detailed structure of Schmidt coefficients and enables rigorous truncation-based error control, linking entanglement structure to computational complexity. Building on this, we derive a generalized entanglement area law under an adiabatic-path condition, extending a central principle of quantum many-body physics to general interactions. As a concrete application, we show that one-dimensional long-range interacting systems admit polynomial bond-dimension approximations for ground, time-evolved, and thermal states, thereby closing the long-standing quasi-polynomial gap and demonstrating that such systems can be simulated efficiently with tensor-network methods. By explicitly controlling R'enyi entanglement, we obtain a rigorous, a priori error guarantee for the time-dependent density-matrix renormalization-group algorithm. Overall, our results extend the SIE theorem to the spectral domain and establish a unified framework that unveils the detailed and universal structure underlying quantum complexity.

Title: Probability-Phase Mutual Information
Authors: Cameron Hahn, Nishan Ranabhat, Fabio Anza
Abstract: Quantum coherence, is an exquisitely quantum phenomenon that depends on both probability amplitudes and relative phases. Standard coherence measures quantify superposition within density matrices but cannot distinguish ensembles that produce the same mixed state through different distributions of pure states. Building on the geometric formulation of quantum mechanics, we introduce the probability-phase mutual information $I(P;\Phi)$. We show that it characterizes quantum coherence at the ensemble level and that ensemble coherence systematically exceeds density-matrix coherence, thus quantifying the structure lost when averaging over pure states. Eventually, its relevance for quantum thermodynamics and deep thermalization in condensed matter physics is highlighted by explicit examples: canonical ensembles reveal temperature-dependent probability-phase correlations absent from thermal density matrices, while a non-vanishing $I(P;\Phi)$ signals the breakdown of deep thermalization.

Title: Critical Quantum Sensing: a tutorial on parameter estimation near quantum phase transitions
Authors: George Mihailescu, Uesli Alushi, Roberto Di Candia, Simone Felicetti, Karol Gietka
Abstract: Quantum phenomena offer the possibility of measuring physical quantities with precision beyond classical limits. However, current progress is constrained by scalability, environmental noise, and challenges in practical integration. This highlights the necessity for novel approaches. An emerging paradigm in this direction is critical quantum metrology -- which harnesses the enhanced susceptibility and nonclassical correlations naturally occurring near quantum phase transitions as resources for quantum-enhanced precision. This tutorial provides a pedagogical introduction to key concepts and a detailed overview of prominent quantum sensing strategies that exploit critical phenomena in metrology. Through examples of increasing complexity, the reader is guided through various critical quantum sensing protocols applied to different critical systems. Special emphasis is placed on the optimal scaling of estimation precision with respect to fundamental resources. Finally, we discuss how critical quantum metrology extends from idealized models to realistic open-system, dissipative regimes, and strongly correlated fermionic systems, outlining both the challenges and opportunities for future quantum technologies.

Title: Adversarial Thermodynamics
Authors: Maite Arcos, Philippe Faist, Takahiro Sagawa, Jonathan Oppenheim
Abstract: In thermodynamics, an agent's ability to extract work is fundamentally constrained by their environment. Traditional frameworks struggle to capture how strategic decision-making under uncertainty, particularly an agent's tolerance for risk, determines the trade-off between extractable work and probability of success in finite-scale experiments. Here, we develop a framework for nonequilibrium thermodynamics based on adversarial resource theories, in which work extraction is modeled as an adversarial game for an agent extracting work. Within this perspective, we consider a Szilard-type engine as a game isomorphic to Kelly gambling, an information-theoretic model of optimal betting under uncertainty -- but with a thermodynamic utility function. Extending the framework to finite-size regimes, we apply a risk-reward trade-off to find an interpretation of the Renyi divergences in terms of extractable work for a given failure probability. By incorporating risk sensitivity via utility functions, we show that the guaranteed amount of work a rational agent would accept instead of undertaking a risky protocol is given by a Renyi divergence. This provides a unified picture of thermodynamics and gambling, and highlights how generalized free energies emerge from an adversarial setup.

Title: Continuous Uniqueness and Novelty Metrics for Generative Modeling of Inorganic Crystals
Authors: Masahiro Negishi, Hyunsoo Park, Kinga O. Mastej, Aron Walsh
Abstract: To address pressing scientific challenges such as climate change, increasingly sophisticated generative artificial intelligence models are being developed that can efficiently sample the large chemical space of possible functional materials. These models can quickly sample new chemical compositions paired with crystal structures. They are typically evaluated using uniqueness and novelty metrics, which depend on a chosen crystal distance function. However, the most prevalent distance function has four limitations: it fails to quantify the degree of similarity between compounds, cannot distinguish compositional difference and structural difference, lacks Lipschitz continuity against shifts in atomic coordinates, and results in a uniqueness metric that is not invariant against the permutation of generated samples. In this work, we propose using two continuous distance functions to evaluate uniqueness and novelty, which theoretically overcome these limitations. Our experiments show that these distances reveal insights missed by traditional distance functions, providing a more reliable basis for evaluating and comparing generative models for inorganic crystals.

Title: Mechanism of the electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene
Authors: Y.-C. Soong, H. Li, Y. Fu, J. Tong, S. Huang, X. Zhang, E. Griffin, E. Hoenig, M. Alhashmi, Y. Li, D. Bahamon, J. Zhong, A. Summerfield, R. N. Costa Filho, C. Sevik, R. Gorbachev, E. C. Neyts, L. F. Vega, F. M. Peeters, M. Lozada-Hidalgo
Abstract: The electrochemical hydrogenation of graphene induces a robust and reversible conductor-insulator transition, of strong interest in logic-and-memory applications. However, its mechanism remains unknown. Here we show that it proceeds as a reduction reaction in which proton adsorption competes with the formation of H2 molecules via an Eley-Rideal process. Graphene's electrochemical hydrogenation is up to $10^6$ times faster than alternative hydrogenation methods and is fully reversible via the oxidative desorption of protons. We demonstrate that the proton reduction rate in defect-free graphene can be enhanced by an order of magnitude by the introduction of nanoscale corrugations in its lattice, and that the substitution of protons for deuterons results both in lower potentials for the hydrogenation process and in a more stable compound. Our results pave the way to investigating the chemisorption of ions in 2D materials at high electric fields, opening a new avenue to control these materials' electronic properties.
