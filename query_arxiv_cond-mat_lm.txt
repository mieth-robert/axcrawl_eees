Title: Turbulent Flows in Electron Hydrodynamics: Conductivity and Vorticity
Authors: Kanad Bhattacharya
Abstract: In this article, we attempt to understand various aspects of turbulent flows in electron hydrodynamics. We analyze a rectangular channel geometry in the presence of an electric field and a Corbino geometry in the presence of a magnetic field. In the former geometry, we analyze the conductivity of the fluid as well as the frequency spectrum of perturbations about the Poiseuille flow. While the normal Poiseuille flow has an associated conductivity which scales as $W^2$, we find a correction which scales as $W^4$ in the case of non-linear flows, where $W$ is the characteristic length of the system. In the Corbino geometry, we analyze the velocity, vorticity and magnetic fields. We find that the vorticity can span across a wide range near the edge of the geometry, a behavior that can be reflected in the velocity and magnetic fields.

Title: Biomolecular crystallization in microfluidic devices
Authors: Nadine Candoni (CINaM, GPEC), Romain Grossier (CINaM), Stéphane Veesler (CINaM)
Abstract: This chapter presents an overview of microfluidic devices reported in the literature, used to develop methodologies for nucleation of biomolecules, with crystal size control, and for collecting thermodynamic and kinetic data. Part I is dedicated to the properties of microfluidic devices through materials used for their fabrication and for crystals analysis. Part II describes the variety of microfluidic devices available and how to handle them to produce flows, droplets and/or wells of micrometer size. These devices use crystallization methods inspired by batch processes and they are mainly used for protein crystallization. Part III focuses on fundamental properties of biomolecule crystallization determined using droplet-based microfluidics: nucleation kinetics, nucleation rate and effective interfacial energy crystal/solution. Part IV explains how the kinetic effect of confinement due to micrometer size, and so nanovolumes, leads to isolation of different phases. These latter are characterized by X-Ray Diffraction (XRD) and methods to minimize manual handling of crystals for XRD are also presented, with appropriate equipment to store the crystals.

Title: Unlocking the full potential of jumping condensation on microstructured surfaces
Authors: Mariia S. Kiseleva, Tytti Karki, Mika Latikka, Parham Koochak, Sakari Lepikko, Maja Vuckovac, Tomi Koskinen, Ramesh Raju, Ville P. Jokinen, Jiazheng Liu, Nenad Miljkovic, Jaakko V.I. Timonen, Ilkka Tittonen, Robin H. A. Ras
Abstract: Water condensation on superhydrophobic surfaces can generate spontaneous droplet jumping, enabling rapid condensate removal and improved thermal and mass transfer. Although this effect has been extensively demonstrated on densely packed nanostructures, the capability of microscale textures to support jumping condensation remains poorly understood. Here, we show that engineered microscale conical arrays can achieve efficient microdroplet jumping and reveal a previously unreported spacing-dependent critical transition between jumping and non-jumping regimes. In the jumping regime, by varying only the cone pitch, we identify a geometric threshold below which sub-10 micron droplets are rapidly removed, and above which jumping is suppressed, resulting in slower dynamics and larger departing droplets. In situ optical and environmental scanning electron microscopies reveal the mechanistic origin of this transition: dense arrays favour full Cassie droplets, which depart cleanly, while wider spacing favours partial Cassie droplets that retain a localized wet region initiating new nucleation. From these results, we construct a geometry-wetting design map linking microstructure spacing, droplet morphology, and nucleation density. These findings establish design principles for scalable, mechanically robust microstructured surfaces capable of high-performance condensation management for anti-fogging, water harvesting, and heat-transfer applications.

Title: Understanding Structural Representation in Foundation Models for Polymers
Authors: Nathaniel H. Park, Eduardo Soares, Victor Y. Shirasuna, Tiffany J. Callahan, Sara Capponi, Emilio Vital Brazil
Abstract: From the relative scarcity of training data to the lack of standardized benchmarks, the development of foundation models for polymers face significant and multi-faceted challenges. At the core, many of these issues are tied directly to the structural representation of polymers and here, we present a new foundation model using a SMILES-based polymer graph representation. This approach allows representation of critical polymer architectural features and connectivity that are not available in other SMILES-based representations. The developed polymer foundation model exhibited excellent performance on 28 different benchmark datasets. Critical evaluation of the developed representation against other variations in control experiments reveals this approach to be a highly performant method of representing polymers in language-based foundation models. These control experiments also reveal a strong invariance of all SMILES representations, with many variations achieving state-of-the-art or near state-of-the-art performance, including those which are chemically or semantically invalid. Examination of error sources and attention maps for the evaluated representations corroborate the findings of the control experiments, showing that chemistry language models based on SMILES interpolate over all sequence space for prediction tasks, not only those of semantically valid inputs. Overall, this work highlights the importance of control experiments as a check on human-imposed assumptions that can limit rational design of both chemistry foundation models and their underlying structural representations.

Title: Coherently synchronized oscillations in many-body localization
Authors: Zi-Jian Li, Yi-Ting Tu, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We find an unexpected phenomenon of coherently synchronized oscillations in a mirror-symmetric many-body localized system. A synchronization transition of the spin oscillations is found by changing the spin-spin interactions. To understand this phenomenon, an effective Ising model based on local integrals of motion is proposed. We find that the synchronization transition can be understood as a paramagnetic-to-ferromagnetic Ising transition. Based on the Ising model, we theoretically estimate the synchronized frequencies and the synchronization transition points, which agree well with numerical results.

Title: Attention-Based Foundation Model for Quantum States
Authors: Timothy Zaklama, Daniele Guerci, Liang Fu
Abstract: We present an attention-based foundation model architecture for learning and predicting quantum states across Hamiltonian parameters, system sizes, and physical systems. Using only basis configurations and physical parameters as inputs, our trained neural network is able to produce highly accurate ground state wavefunctions. For example, we build the phase diagram for the 2D square-lattice $t-V$ model with $N$ particles, from only 18 parameters $(V/t,N)$. Thus, our architecture provides a basis for building a universal foundation model for quantum matter.

Title: Multichannel Kondo Effect in Superconducting Leads
Authors: Pradip Kattel, Abay Zhakenov, Natan Andrei
Abstract: The traditional multichannel Kondo effect takes place when several gapless metallic electronic channels interact with a localized spin-$S$ impurity, with the number of channels $n$ exceeding the size of the impurity spin, $n>2S$, leading to the emergence of non-Fermi liquid impurity behavior at low temperatures. Here, we show that the effect can be realized even when the electronic degrees of freedom are strongly correlated and gapped. The system under consideration consists of a single spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ impurity coupled isotropically to $n$ spin singlet superconducting channels realized by one-dimensional leads with quasi-long-range superconducting order. The competition between the Kondo and superconducting fluctuations induces multiple distinct ground states and boundary phases depending on the relative strengths of the bulk and boundary interactions. Using the Bethe Ansatz technique, we identify four regimes: an overscreened Kondo phase, a zero-mode phase, a Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) phase, and a local-moment phase with an unscreened impurity, each with its own experimental characteristic. We describe the renormalization-group flow, the excitation spectrum, and the full impurity thermodynamics in each phase. Remarkably, even in the presence of a bulk mass gap, the boundary critical behavior in the Kondo phase is governed by the same exponents as in the gapless theory with the low-energy impurity sector flowing to the $SU(2)_n$ Wess-Zumino-Witten (WZW) fixed point, and the impurity entropy monotonically decreasing as a function of temperature. In both the overscreened Kondo and zero-mode phases, the residual impurity entropy is $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln[2\cos(\pi/(n+2))]$. In the YSR and unscreened phases on the other hand the impurity entropy exhibits non-monotonic temperature dependence and is effectively free at low temperatures with $S_{\mathrm{imp}}(T \to 0) = \ln 2$.

Title: Coarse-Graining via Lumping: Exact Calculations and Fundamental Limitations
Authors: Gianluca Teza, Attilio L. Stella, Trevor GrandPre
Abstract: Detecting broken time-reversibility at micro- and nanoscale is often difficult when experiments offer limited state resolution. We introduce a lumping method that builds an effective semi-Markov model able to reproduce exactly the full entropy-production statistics of the microscopic dynamics. The mean entropy production stays accurate even when hidden current-carrying cycles are merged, though higher-order information can be unavoidably lost. In these cases, we capture violations of fluctuation theorems consistent with experiments, opening a path to novel inference strategies out of equilibrium.

Title: van der Waals Nanoreactors
Authors: Zhaoyi Joy Zheng, Haosen Guan, Danrui Ni, Guangming Cheng, Yanyu Jia, Ipsita Das, Yue Tang, Ayelet July Uzan-Narovlansky, Lihan Shi, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Nan Yao, Robert J Cava, Sanfeng Wu
Abstract: Advancing the chemical synthesis of crystals is important for both fundamental research and practical applications of quantum materials. While established bulk-phase and thin-film growth methods have enabled enormous progress, synthesizing single crystals suitable for quantum electronic discoveries remains challenging for many emerging materials. Here, we introduce van der Waals (vdW) stacks as nanochemical reactors for single-crystal synthesis and demonstrate their broad applicability in growing both elemental and compound crystals at the micrometer scale. By encapsulating atomically thin reactants that are stacked compactly with inert vdW layers such as hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), we achieve nanoconfined synthesis with the resulting crystals remaining encapsulated. As proof of concept, we synthesized isolated single crystals of elemental tellurium and distinct types of Pd-Te compounds. Structural characterization, including atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, confirms the high crystalline quality of the products. We confirm the intrinsic semiconducting gap of tellurium and observe that non-stoichiometric PdTe1-x with a significantly reduced Te content (x ~ 0.18, a regime not previously achieved) retains uniform crystallinity and exhibits superconductivity below a critical temperature of 3.8 K. This nanochemical synthesis is broadly generalizable, chip-integrable, well-suited to a wide range of processing conditions, and compatible with nanofabrication routines for constructing devices. The concept of vdW nanoreactors offers a powerful and versatile pathway to expand the accessible landscape of quantum materials.

Title: Characterizing Memristive Nanowire Network Models via a Unified Computational Framework
Authors: Marcus Kasdorf, Diego Simpson-Ochoa, Abdelrahman Bekhit, Mauro S. Ferreira, Wilten Nicola, Claudia Gomes da Rocha
Abstract: Randomly self-assembled nanowire networks (NWNs) are dynamical systems in which junctions between two nanowires can be modelled as memristive units viewed as adaptive resistors with memory. Various memristive models have been proposed to capture the complex mechanics of these junctions. Here, we showcase a novel computational framework named Memristive Nanowire Network Simulator (MemNNetSim) to simulate and analyze random memristive NWNs in a unified approach. Implemented using the Python programming language, MemNNetSim allows for the analysis of static and dynamic scenarios of NWNs under arbitrary memristive models. This provides a versatile foundation to build upon in further work, such as reservoir dynamics with NWNs, which has seen increased interest due to the interconnected architecture of NWNs. In this work, we introduce the package, demonstrate its utility in simulating NWNs, and then test advanced scenarios in which it can aid in the exploratory analysis of these systems, particularly in learning how to use NWNs as a physical reservoir in reservoir computing applications.

Title: In situ Study of p-NiO Film Quality at High Temperatures up to 1100 deg C
Authors: Hunter Ellis, Bobby G. Duersch, Botong Li, Imteaz Rahaman, Jim Pierce, Michael A. Scarpulla, Kai Fu
Abstract: NiO is a promising p-type material for photovoltaics and power electronics, but its temperature limits remain unclear. Using in situ high-temperature X-ray diffraction (HT-XRD) from 30 to 1100 C, we track the structural evolution of NiO thin films in air. The film crystallizes from an amorphous phase to cubic NiO between 300 and 400 C, where the emergence and growth of the (111) diffraction peak correlate with an increase in electrical resistivity. Further increases in temperature lead to improved crystallinity and higher resistivity. At 1100 C, the formation of Ni2O3 is observed, resulting in a highly resistive film. This study establishes a clear correlation between phase evolution, crystallinity, and resistive behavior in NiO thin films.

Title: Fermi Liquid Fixed Point Deformations due to Codimension Two Defects
Authors: Jin-Yun Lin, Ira Z. Rothstein
Abstract: We show that codimension-two defects in Fermi liquids deform the renormalization group flow via a marginally relevant coupling. The mechanism for generating the flow is distinct from the case of the Kondo problem (codimension-three defects) in that the effective particle-hole asymmetry that leads to the log running is due to the spatial anisotropy generated by the defect. The mechanism for the log generation has a simple geometric explanation which shows that hole fluctuations are suppressed as the incoming momentum is taken to be along the direction of the defect. The RG flow time is shown to scale with the length of the defect. We also show that the dislon, the Goldstone mode localized to the defect, couples in a non-derivative fashion to the bulk fermions and becomes relevant above the dislons' Debye frequency which depends upon the defect tension.

Title: Perturbative second-order optical susceptibility of bulk materials: a symmetry-enforced return to non-orthogonal localized basis sets
Authors: Angiolo Huaman, Luis Enrique Rosas-Hernandez, Salvador Barraza-Lopez
Abstract: The second-order optical susceptibility of semiconductors $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ finds application in metrology, spectroscopy, telecommunications, material characterization, and quantum information. Pioneering calculations of $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ utilized non-orthogonal Gaussian orbitals centered at atoms. That formulation transitioned into plane-wave-based algorithms as time went by. As of late, nevertheless, multiple tools for calculating optical susceptibilities have recast the problem using Wannier ({\em i.e.}, {\em localized}) orbitals, making a comeback onto frameworks based on localized basis sets. Here, we present an approach for calculating $\chi_{ijk}^{(2)}(-2\omega;\omega,\omega)$ reliant on numerical pseudoatomic orbitals (PAOs) within perturbation theory in the velocity gauge. Its salient feature is a calculation of `Slater-Koster-like' two-center integrals of the momentum operator in between PAOs identified by symmetry. The approach was successfully tested on paradigmatic cubic silicon carbide (3C-SiC) and gallium arsenide, for which linear responses are contributed as well.

Title: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang and glassy properties in 2D Anderson localization: eigenstates and wave packets
Authors: Noam Izem, Bertrand Georgeot, Jiangbin Gong, Gabriel Lemarié, Sen Mu
Abstract: Despite decades of research, the universal nature of fluctuations in disordered quantum systems remains poorly understood. Here, we present extensive numerical evidence that fluctuations in two-dimensional (2D) Anderson localization belongs to the (1+1)-dimensional Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality class. In turn, by adopting the KPZ framework, we gain fresh insight into the structure and phenomenology of Anderson localization itself. We analyze both localized eigenstates and time-evolved wave packets, demonstrating that the fluctuation of their logarithmic density follows the KPZ scaling. Moreover, we reveal that the internal structure of these eigenstates exhibits glassy features characteristic of the directed polymer problem, including the emergence of dominant paths together with pinning and avalanche behavior. Localization is not isotropic but organized along preferential branches of weaker confinement, corresponding to these dominant paths. For localized wave packets, we further demonstrate that their spatial profiles obey a stretched-exponential form consistent with the KPZ scaling, while remaining fully compatible with the single-parameter scaling (SPS) hypothesis, a cornerstone of Anderson localization theory. Altogether, our results establish a unified KPZ framework for describing fluctuations and microscopic organization in 2D Anderson localization, revealing the glassy nature of localized states and providing new understanding into the universal structure of disordered quantum systems.

Title: Soft-Lubrication Drainage and Rupture in Particle-Driven Vesicles
Authors: Yuan-Nan Young, Bryan Quaife, Herve Nganguia, On Shun Pak, Jie Feng, Howard A. Stone
Abstract: The deformation and rupture of a lipid vesicle due to the forced normal approach of an inclusion are essential for optimizing the design of magnetic giant unilamellar vesicles [magGUVs, Malik et al., Nanoscale 17, 13720 (2025)], with implications for active colloid-membrane interactions and cellular-scale chemical delivery. Here, we investigate vesicles propelled by a force-driven rigid inclusion and reveal a robust elastohydrodynamic mechanism: the inclusion outpaces the vesicle, sustaining a thinning film that drains symmetrically and self-similarly, largely independent of initial shape. For soft membranes and small inclusions, coupling drives a monotonic tension increase that can exceed the lysis tension. Evaluating the maximal tension over a delivery distance, we map an operating window in vesicle reduced area and size relative to the inclusion.

Title: On the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for fermionic Hamiltonians without a linear part
Authors: Davide Bonaretti (Università di Pisa)
Abstract: A self-contained treatment of the Bogoliubov-Valatin transformation for homogeneous fermionic Hamiltonians is presented. The aim is to provide a quick reference that may also serve as supplementary material for a graduate-level course, and that can be understood with quantum mechanics knowledge up to the level of the second quantization's rules. The objective of the transformation is to cast a quadratic Hamiltonian into a diagonal form that resembles the Hamiltonian of a system of non-interacting particles. To obtain this, the first step consists in putting its coefficient matrix into its canonical form; the transformation can always be performed on fermionic Hamiltonians, only some care must be taken when this form is singular. Having explained how to cast a general matrix into its standard form, a complete description of the transformation is provided; a novel procedure is proposed here for the singular matrix case.

Title: Perturbative Input-Output Theory of Floquet Cavity Magnonics and Magnon Energy Shifts
Authors: T. Aguiar, M. C. de Oliveira
Abstract: We develop a perturbative input-output formalism to compute the reflectance and transmittance spectra of cavity magnonics systems subject to a Floquet modulation. The method exploits the strong hierarchy between the magnetic-dipole couplings transverse (drive field) and parallel (modulation field) to the static bias field, which naturally introduces the small parameter $\epsilon = (2Ns)^{-1/2}$ associated with the total spin $Ns$ of the ferromagnet. By organizing the cavity and magnon fields in a systematic expansion in $\epsilon$, we obtain compact analytic expressions for the spectra up to second order. Using these results, we reproduce the characteristic sideband structure observed in recent Floquet cavity electromagnonics experiments. Furthermore, accounting for the Zeeman interaction between the modulation field and the fully polarized ground state - a contribution typically neglected in previous treatments - we predict an additional magnon detuning of approximately $0.8\,\mathrm{GHz}$, independent of both modulation frequency and sample size and determined solely by the spatial volume occupied by the modulation field. This identifies a measurable and previously overlooked shift relevant for the interpretation and design of cavity magnonics experiments.

Title: Self-Consistent Renormalized Spin-Wave Theory of Magnetic and Topological Transitions in Two-Dimensional Honeycomb Ferromagnets
Authors: Jian-Lin Li, Chien-Te Wu
Abstract: We investigate finite-temperature magnetic and topological phase transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb ferromagnets using an extended self-consistent renormalized spin-wave theory (SRSWT) that incorporates higher-order corrections from the Holstein--Primakoff expansion. Focusing on the combined effects of single-ion anisotropy, Zeeman field, next-nearest-neighbor (NNN) exchange, and Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction, we analyze how these parameters influence the magnetization curves and magnon spectra. This work serves two main goals. First, we critically examine the limitations of SRSWT, showing that in the absence of external or interaction tuning, the theory tends to overestimate magnon self-energy corrections, often predicting first-order magnetic transitions with multivalued magnetization and metastable solution branches (i.e., self-consistent but thermodynamically unstable states). Second, we demonstrate that topological transitions -- signaled by magnon gap closings at the Dirac points -- can be tuned to occur below the magnetic transition temperature and within the thermodynamically stable regime. In particular, we identify two practical tuning strategies: applying an external Zeeman field of appropriate sign depending on the anisotropy strength, and introducing a small antiferromagnetic NNN exchange coupling. These findings not only clarify the predictive scope and limitations of SRSWT but also provide experimentally relevant guidance for realizing thermally driven topological transitions in two-dimensional honeycomb magnetic insulators.

Title: Simultaneous power generation and cooling using semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells
Authors: Atsushi Hayashida, Hitoshi Saito, Yang Chunxiang, Taiga Nishii, Motokazu Ishihara, Yuta Nakamura, Kento Sunaga, Sachiko Matsushita
Abstract: This manuscript reports a semiconductor-sensitized thermal cell (STC) that converts ambient heat into electrical power while simultaneously reducing its own temperature under isothermal conditions. Using a printable semiconductor--electrolyte architecture, we fabricate $4\,\mathrm{cm} \times 4\,\mathrm{cm}$ devices that generate up to approximately $0.2\,\mathrm{mW}$ at temperatures of $40$--$55\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$. During continuous discharge, the STC exhibits a transient temperature decrease followed by thermal equilibration with the environment. In contrast, periodic on--off discharge produces sustained cooling of approximately $1\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$ relative to a non-discharging reference. Notably, parallel integration of four STCs yields a nonlinear enhancement of cooling (approximately $5\,^\circ\mathrm{C}$) without a corresponding increase in electrical output. The observed behavior can be understood within a macroscopic energy-balance framework, in which time modulation of electrochemical heat consumption prevents the establishment of thermal steady state. These results demonstrate sustained isothermal cooling induced by heat-to-electricity conversion at practical device scales, and highlight semiconductor-sensitized thermal cells as a platform for coupled energy harvesting and thermal management.

Title: Quench induced collective excitations: from breathing to acoustic modes
Authors: Shicong Song, Ke Wang, Zhengli Wu, Andreas Glatz, K. Levin, Han Fu
Abstract: In trapped Bose-Einstein condensates, interaction quenches which are abrupt changes of the interaction strength typically implemented via Feshbach tuning, are a practical and widely used protocol to address far-from-equilibrium collective modes. Using both numerical Gross Pitaevskii and analytical schemes we study these interaction-quench-induced collective modes in a harmonically trapped two-dimensional Bose--Einstein condensate contrasting the behavior found at low and high energies. In the low-lying regime, we characterize realistic circumstances in which there is a breakdown of the expected scale invariance so that the collective excitations follow hydrodynamic theory instead of the predictions given by SO(2,1) conformal symmetry. In the high energy regime, we focus on important trap effects associated with acoustic oscillations which have been of interest experimentally. This comprehensive analysis of the collective excitations in trapped two-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensates is experimentally accessible. Through their frequencies and damping, this reflects an important built-in spectroscopy of such many-body states.

Title: Epitaxial Recovery of beta-Ga2O3 after High Dose Implantation
Authors: Tianhai Luo, Katie R. Gann, Cameron A. Gorsak, Hari P. Nair, R. B. van Dover, Michal O. Thompson
Abstract: As an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor, beta-Ga2O3 has been attractive for its strong tolerance to irradiation damage and high n-type conductivity through ion implantation. Homoepitaxial (010) \b{eta}-Ga2O3 films grown by MOCVD were implanted with Ge to study the post-implantation damage and lattice recovery after thermal annealing. Box profiles of 100 or 50 nm at concentration of 5*10^19 or 3*10^19 cm^-3 were formed, with maximum displacement per atom (DPA) of 1.2 or 2.0. Lattice recovery was investigated using X-ray diffraction (XRD) for anneals from 100 C to 1050 C. A gamma-phase related peak was observed for all implant conditions. All samples showed strain relaxation of beta-phase peak at temperature below 500 C, with no significant change for the gamma-phase related peak. For lower damage implants, films recovered fully to epitaxial beta-phase after sequential annealing to 900 C. For the higher damage implant, the gamma-phase associated peak annealed out with increasing temperature, but a new diffraction peak formed at slightly smaller lattice spacing; full recovery of the lattice was not observed until annealing at 1050 C. The newly formed diffraction peak is identified as beta-(20-4), beta-(512), or beta-(71-2), each potentially arising from the conversion of gamma-phase to beta-phase via a common oxygen sub-lattice.

Title: Random Combinatorial Libraries and Automated Nanoindentation for High-Throughput Structural Materials Discovery
Authors: Vivek Chawla, Dayakar Penumadu, Sergei Kalinin
Abstract: Accelerating the discovery of structural materials is essential for applications in hard and refractory alloys, hypersonic platforms, nuclear systems, and other extreme environment technologies. Progress is often constrained by slow synthesis and characterization cycles and the need for extensive mechanical testing across large compositional spaces. Here, we propose a rapid screening strategy based on random material libraries, in which thousands of distinct compositions are embedded within a single specimen, mapped by EDS, and subsequently characterized. Using nanoindentation as a representative case, we show that such libraries enable dense composition property mapping while reducing the number of samples required to explore high dimensional composition spaces compared to traditional synthesis and test workflows. An experimentally calibrated Monte Carlo framework is developed to quantify practical limits, including particle size, EDS noise and resolution, positional accuracy, and nanoindenter motion costs. The simulations identify regimes where random libraries provide orders of magnitude acceleration over classical workflows. Finally, we demonstrate experimental navigation of these libraries using automated indentation. Together, these results establish random libraries as a general route to high throughput characterization in structurally critical material systems.

Title: Radio-frequency assisted switching in perpendicular magnetic tunnel junctions
Authors: Mark Hayward, Salvatore Perna, Massimiliano d'Aquino, Claudio Serpico, Wonjoon Jung, Chunhui Dai, Patrick M. Braganca, Ilya N. Krivorotov
Abstract: Spin-transfer torque magnetic random-access memory (STT-MRAM) relies on nanoscale magnetic tunnel junctions (MTJs) as its fundamental building blocks. Next-generation STT-MRAM requires strategies that simultaneously improve switching energy efficiency and device endurance. Here, we present the first study of perpendicular STT-MRAM writing assisted by radio-frequency (RF) spin torque. We show that applying a small-amplitude RF pulse prior to a direct-current (DC) writing pulse enhances the MTJ switching probability, with the efficiency gain increasing at lower RF frequencies. This RF+DC writing scheme enables shorter DC pulses, thereby improving device endurance. Analytical and numerical modeling qualitatively reproduces the experimental trends, while quantitative discrepancies indicate that realistic MTJ properties beyond idealized models play an important role in RF-assisted switching.

Title: Anion correlation induced nonrelativistic spin splitting in rutile antiferromagnets
Authors: Siddhartha S. Nathan, Danilo Puggioni, Linding Yuan, James M. Rondinelli
Abstract: Many studies of non-relativistic spin-splitting (NRSS), or altermagnetism, have focused on idealized, perfectly ordered crystals, relying on symmetry-based approaches to identify candidate materials. Here, we theoretically investigate how local short-range ordering (SRO) influences NRSS of energy bands in partially ordered collinear antiferromagnetic iron oxyfluoride (FeOF). Using the cluster expansion method, we identify four nearly degenerate structures (energy difference $\leq 8$ meV per formula unit) that represent distinct snapshots of local plane-to-plane O/F correlations. Our density functional theory (DFT) results show robust NRSS along the $\Gamma$-M direction in all four structures, despite the absence of long-range order. The magnitude and character of the splitting depend sensitively on the specific direction of anion correlations, effects that are not fully captured in high-symmetry average structures. Notably, two configurations ($Pmc2_1$ and $Pm$) exhibit $\Gamma$-point spin splitting absent in ordered FeF$_2$ and a virtual crystal approximation model of FeOF. We further predict distinct magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) signatures, enabling experimental detection of SRO-driven electronic structure changes. These results highlight heteroanionic compounds as a promising design space for NRSS antiferromagnets, with experimentally synthesized FeOF already exhibiting a substantially higher Néel temperature (315\,K) than FeF$_2$ (79\,K).

Title: Experimental benchmark of the quantum-classical crossover in a spin ladder
Authors: Hironori Yamaguchi, Itsuki Shimamura, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo, Koji Araki, Yoshiki Iwasaki, Masayuki Hagiwara
Abstract: We report a spin-(1/2, 5/2) three-leg ladder realized in a radical-Mn polymer, exhibiting an antiferromagnetic transition and magnetization curves accurately described by classical mean-field theory. Although the underlying spin model intrinsically supports strong quantum fluctuations, as confirmed by quantum Monte Carlo simulations, the real system shows an anomalously complete suppression of quantum behavior. These findings provide a key experimental benchmark for the quantum-classical crossover and suggest that lattice topology can play a crucial role in tuning the balance between quantum and classical physics in strongly correlated systems.

Title: Diamond crystal with Y-defects: spectroscopy and transmittion electron microscopy
Authors: A.A. Shiryaev, E.F. Vasilev, A.L. Vasilev, V.V. Artemov, N.V. Gubanov, D.A. Zedgenizov
Abstract: The paper presents resutls of investigation of a natural Ib-IaA diamond containing Y-defects. Analysis of spatial distribution of nitrogen-related A and C centers and intensity of Infra-red absorption at Raman frequency (1332 cm-1) reveals anticorrelation between these defects. Transmission electron microscopy of a zone with abundant Y-defects shows presence of dislocations in various configurations and numerous clusters of point defects generated by non-conservative dislocation motion. Extended defects with shape resembling thin (1-3 nm) rhombic plates with the largest dimension up to 20 nm are observed. Analysis of contrast of these defects shows that they represent nanosized voids (vacancy clusters). It is suggested that the defects were formed by annihilation of dislocation dipoles with subsequent growth by consumption of vacancies produced by non-conservative motion of dislocations. Upon excitation by 787 nm laser, numerous narrow photoluminescecne lines are observed between 800-900 nm; their intensity and position show irregular temporal variations. Such behaviour (blinking) was earlier noted for hydrogenated nanodiamonds. It is suggested that unusual behaviour of the luminescence lines may be explained by recombination processes at internal walls of the discovered nanovoids.

Title: Scalable Quantum Photonic Platform Based on Site-Controlled Quantum Dots Coupled to Circular Bragg Grating Resonators
Authors: Kartik Gaur, Avijit Barua, Sarthak Tripathi, Léo J. Roche, Steffen Wilksen, Alexander Steinhoff, Sam Baraz, Neha Nitin, Chirag C. Palekar, Aris Koulas-Simos, Imad Limame, Priyabrata Mudi, Sven Rodt, Christopher Gies, Stephan Reitzenstein
Abstract: The scalable integration of solid-state quantum emitters into photonic nanostructures remains a central challenge for quantum photonic technologies. Here, we demonstrate a robust and streamlined integration strategy that tackles the long-standing issue of deterministic fabrication on randomly positioned self-assembled quantum dots (QDs), leveraging a buried-stressor-based site-controlled InGaAs QD platform. We show that this deterministic growth approach enables precise spatial alignment with circular Bragg grating (CBG) resonators for enhanced emission, eliminating the need for complex and time-consuming deterministic lithography techniques. We fabricated a $6\times6$ SCQD-CBG array with 100\% device yield, with 35 devices falling within the radial-offset range where the simulated photon-extraction efficiency (PEE) exceeds 20\%, underscoring the spatial precision and scalability of our fabrication concept. A systematically selected subset of five devices with varying radial displacements reveals clear offset-dependent trends in extraction efficiency, spectral linewidth, and photon indistinguishability, thereby establishing quantitative bounds on spatial alignment tolerances. In the best-aligned QD-CBG device, we achieve a PEE of $(47.1\pm3.8)\%$, a linewidth of $(1.41\pm0.22)$ GHz, a radiative decay lifetime of $(0.80\pm0.02)$~ns, a single-photon purity of $(99.58\pm0.18)\%$, and a Hong-Ou-Mandel two-photon interference visibility of $(81\pm5)\%$ under quasi-resonant excitation at saturation power. We confirm our conceptual understanding of the effect of emitter-position dependent charge-noise fluctuations in terms of a quantum-optical model for the (quantum-)emission properties.

Abstract: We investigate HgTe/Nb-based three-terminal Josephson junctions in T-shaped and X-shaped geometries and their critical current contours (CCCs). By decomposing the CCCs into the contributions from individual junctions, we uncover how bias current and magnetic field jointly determine the collective Josephson behavior. A perpendicular magnetic field induces a tunable crossover between SQUID-like and Fraunhofer-like interference patterns, controlled by the applied bias. Moreover, magnetic flux produces pronounced deformations of the CCC, enabling symmetry control in the $(I_1,I_2)$ plane. Remarkably, we identify a regime of strongly enhanced Josephson diode efficiency, reaching values up to $\eta\approx 0.8$ at low bias and magnetic field. The experimental results are quantitatively reproduced by resistively shunted junction (RSJ) simulations, which capture the coupled dynamics of current and flux in these multi-terminal superconducting systems.

Title: Active learning potentials for first-principles phase diagrams using replica-exchange nested sampling
Authors: Nico Unglert, Michael Ketter, Georg K. H. Madsen
Abstract: Accurate prediction of materials phase diagrams from first principles remains a central challenge in computational materials science. Machine-learning interatomic potentials can provide near-DFT accuracy at a fraction of the cost, but their reliability crucially depends on the availability of representative training data that span all relevant regions of the potential-energy surface. Here, we present a fully automated active-learning (AL) strategy based on replica-exchange nested sampling (RENS) for the generation of training data and the computation of complete pressure-temperature phase diagrams. In our framework, RENS acts as both the exploration engine and the acquisition mechanism: its intrinsic diversity and likelihood-constrained sampling ensure that the configurations selected for DFT labeling are both informative and thermodynamically representative. We apply the approach to silicon, germanium, and titanium using potentials trained at the r2SCAN level of theory. For all systems, the AL process converges within 10-15 iterations, yielding transferable potentials that reproduce known phase transitions and thermodynamic trends. These results demonstrate that RENS-based AL provides a general and autonomous route to constructing machine-learning interatomic potentials and predicting first-principles phase diagrams across broad thermodynamic conditions.

Title: Shape descriptors of equilibrium states in a quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials: A geometric analysis near the phase transitions in Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals
Authors: S. Özüm, T. Akkurt, R. Erdem, N. Güçlü
Abstract: We analyze the equilibrium states of quantum lattice model with local multi-well potentials for Sn$_2$P$_2$S$_6$ ferroelectric crystals using the mean and Gaussian curvatures ($H$, $K$), curvedness ($C$) and shape index ($S$). From the energy gap, pressure and temperature variations of $H$, $K$, $C$ and $S$, we have reported the geometric construction of the free energy surfaces for the ferroelectric and paraelectric phases. Their behaviors are explicitly observed near the ferroelectric-paraelectric phase transitions. It is found that $H$, $C$ and $S$ display a cusp singularity at the criticality while $K$ converges to zero on both sides of the critical and tricritical points.

Title: Theory of local orbital magnetization: local Berry curvature
Authors: Sariah Al Saati, Karyn Le Hur, Frédéric Piéchon
Abstract: We present a microscopic theory for the local (single site) orbital magnetization in tight-binding systems. Each occupied state of energy $\varepsilon_n$ contributes with a local orbital magnetic moment term ${\mathbf{ m}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a local Berry-curvature term ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. For Bloch electrons (${\mathbf{ k}}$-space), we go beyond the modern theory by revealing the sublattice texture. We identify a topological contribution ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}^{\text{topo}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ and a geometric contribution ${\mathbf{\Omega}}^{\text{geom}}_{n\mathbf{ k}}({\mathbf{ r}})$ to the sublattice Berry curvature. For systems with open boundaries (${\mathbf{ r}}$-space), we derive an explicit expression of an effective onsite Berry curvature ${\mathbf{ \Omega}}_n({\mathbf{ r}})$. Considering two band models, the $\mathbf{ k}$-space and $\mathbf{ r}$-space onsite magnetizations coincide numerically but differ from the Bianco-Resta approach. They reveal orbital ferromagnetism in topological insulators, and orbital antiferro- and ferrimagnetism in trivial insulators. This theory can be used to investigate orbital magnetic textures and their topological properties in many systems of current interest (Moiré, amorphous, quasicrystals, defects, molecules).

Title: Interaction-assisted topological pumping in few- and many-atom Rydberg arrays
Authors: Chenxi Huang, Tao Chen, Qian Liang, Matthew A. Krebs, Ethan Springhorn, Ruiyu Li, Mingsheng Tian, Kaden R. A. Hazzard, Jacob P. Covey, Bryce Gadway
Abstract: Topology can imbue lattice systems with special properties, notably the presence of robust eigenstates living at their boundary. Through dimensional reduction, the robust bulk band topology of, e.g., the integer quantum Hall system can be mapped onto similarly robust charge-pumping dynamics of a topological pump living in one lower dimension. Recent studies have uncovered a rich influence of interactions on the dynamics of topological pumps in nonlinear systems, including the robust pumping of self-bound solitons. These striking observations in classical nonlinear photonics have raised a number of questions, chiefly if and how this phenomenology persists in strongly correlated quantum systems and in the few-body limit. Here, using few- and many-atom arrays, we explore how dipolar interactions impact the dynamics of topological population pumping along a Rydberg synthetic dimension. In the few-body limit, we find that dipolar interactions lead to self-bound states that are efficiently pumped along the synthetic dimension, described by an emergent pair-state topological pump. We find that this interaction-assisted pumping persists in many-atom arrays, with a sharpened dependence on the dipolar interaction strength that stems from the enhanced spatial connectivity. These Rydberg-based studies on interaction-assisted topological pumping help connect observations from classical nonlinear photonics to the few-body quantum limit and pave the way for studies of new strongly correlated quantum pumping phenomena.

Title: Soft Colloidal Robots: Magnetically Guided Liquid Crystal Torons for Targeted Micro-Cargo Delivery
Authors: Joel Torres, Rodrigo C.V. Coelho, Patrick Oswald, Francesc Sagés, Jordi Ignés-Mullol
Abstract: Quasiparticles in liquid crystals, such as torons and skyrmions, represent a new class of topologically protected solitonic excitations, offering a promising route toward soft microrobotics. Here we demonstrate that torons can be propelled by modulated electric fields and magnetically steered with full directional control, thus achieving programmable trajectories without net liquid flow. Within microfluidic architectures, we guide ensembles of torons through confined channels and realize targeted pick-up, transport, and release of colloidal cargo. By combining experiments and numerical simulations, we uncover how magnetic alignment reshapes toron structure, speed, and stability, while confinement within microchannels gives rise to novel transport regimes. Unlike conventional colloidal inclusions, torons are intrinsically uniform, soft, and reconfigurable, establishing them as both an ideal model system for studying emergent phenomena in active topological matter and a versatile platform for next-generation soft robots, adaptive delivery systems, and smart active matter.

Title: Diagrammatics in the Dual Space, or There and Back Again
Authors: Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: Accurately describing many-body effects in multi-orbital systems remains a major challenge in theoretical condensed matter physics. At present, there is a significant methodological gap between the numerical tools used in ab initio computational materials science and those developed to study strong electronic correlations. The former can treat realistic, large-scale systems but typically neglect many-body effects, while the latter focus on simplified models with only a few degrees of freedom, as only such models can be solved accurately in the presence of strong interactions. The purpose of this thesis is to bridge these two approaches and establish a systematic theoretical framework for realistic correlated electronic materials. This involves a full-cycle methodology that begins with constructing ab initio interacting models from density-functional theory, solving them using dynamical mean-field theory to capture local correlations, and extending beyond to incorporate non-local collective electronic fluctuations. To this end, we introduce the "dual" approach to strong correlations, which includes the dual fermion, dual boson, and dual triply irreducible local expansion methods. The central idea of the dual theories is to shift the reference point of the conventional Feynman diagrammatic expansion from a non-interacting electronic system to an interacting but exactly solvable one. Integrating out this reference system recasts the expansion in an effective dual space, where all diagrammatic building blocks are renormalized by the corresponding impurity quantities. This procedure transforms a non-perturbative expansion in the original variables into a perturbative expansion in terms of dual fermionic and bosonic fields, exact in both the weak- and strong-coupling limits. In this thesis, we collect and systematize the major developments of dual techniques achieved to date.

Title: Morphogenesis of bacterial colonies in liquid crystalline environments
Authors: Sebastian Gonzalez La Corte, Thomas G. J. Chandler, Saverio E. Spagnolie, Ned S. Wingreen, Sujit S. Datta
Abstract: Natural bacterial habitats are often complex fluids with viscoelastic and anisotropic responses to stress; for example, they can take the form of liquid crystals (LCs), with elongated microscopic constituents that collectively align while still retaining the ability to flow. However, laboratory studies typically focus on cells in simple liquids or complex fluids with randomly-oriented constituents. Here, we show how interactions with LCs shape bacterial proliferation in multicellular colonies. Using experiments, we find that in a nematic LC, cells generically form aligned single-cell-wide "chains" as they reproduce. As these chains lengthen, they eventually buckle in a highly localized manner. By combining our measurements with a continuum mechanical theory, we demonstrate that this distinctive morphogenetic program emerges because cells are kept in alignment due to the LC's elasticity; as each chain lengthens, growth-induced viscous stresses along its contour eventually overcome the elasticity of the surrounding nematic, leading to buckling. Our work thus reveals and provides mechanistic insight into the previously-overlooked role of LCs in sculpting bacterial life in complex environments.

Title: Exploring the energy landscape of the logarithmic potential: local minima and stationary states
Authors: Paolo Amore, Victor Figueroa, Raymundo Ramos
Abstract: We have performed a detailed exploration of the energy landscape for configurations of points on the sphere, interacting via the logarithmic potential, and corresponding to local minima of the total energy, up to $N = 160$. The growth of $N_{\rm conf}$ (number of distinct configurations) is exponential, as for the Thomson problem, although weaker. Using the techniques described in our previous paper~\cite{Amore25} we have also explored the solution landscape of this problem for $N \leq 24$, and found that the number of stationary states is growing exponentially.

Title: Rational Design Principles for Na- and Li-ion Carbon Anodes from Interlayer Spacing Control
Authors: Ihor Radchenko (1), Oleksandr I. Malyi (1 and 2) ((1) Centre of Excellence ENSEMBLE3 Sp. z o. o., (2) Qingyuan Innovation Laboratory)
Abstract: Graphite, the standard commercial anode for Li-ion batteries, is thermodynamically incompatible with Na-ion batteries, leading researchers to search for alternative C-based structures (e.g., hard carbon, expanded graphite). In a simplified picture, the main idea of such search relies on identifying disordered C structures with a large interlayer spacing and distribution of local structural motifs (e.g., pores) with target electrochemical properties. Such exploration is typically done via trial-and-error experimentation, which often does not allow precise understanding of the role of interlayer distance and even Na/Li-ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance. Motivated by this, using density-functional theory and cluster expansion, we establish a structure-property relationship for Li- and Na-intercalation across a range of graphite interlayer spacings and stacking arrangements. We show that Na intercalation becomes thermodynamically possible in large concentrations above 4.21 Å even without a change in interlayer spacing. Conversely, Li intercalation has a narrow optimal window, with maximum capacity (close to the commercial limit) at approximately 3.75 Å, while larger spacings (e.g., 4.58 Å) quickly reduce Li storage capacity. We also find that AA-stacked domains consistently offer stronger ion bonding and higher voltages than AB-stacked domains for both ions. Our results, thus, not only explain the role of metal ion intercalation in the electrochemical performance, but also clarify the fundamental design trade-offs for expanded C anodes, offering practical targets and interlayer distance ranges for the independent optimization of the next generation of negative electrodes for metal-ion batteries.

Title: Field-Particle Interactions in Curved Flows for Shape-Asymmetric Active Particles
Authors: Derek C. Gomes, Tapan C. Adhyapak
Abstract: We show that curvatures in general ambient flow profiles can align shape-asymmetric active particles, revealing a previously overlooked competition with externally applied aligning fields. Focusing on the ubiquitous case of channel flows, we then investigate the fundamental consequences of this competition for the dynamics of shape-asymmetric active particles in microchannels in the presence of orienting fields. We find that this interplay gives rise to novel mechanisms for controlling particle dynamics, with potentially broad applications, and suggests exciting possibilities such as active-particle analogs of electronic systems.

Title: Substrate tuning of the structural and electronic transition in thin flakes of the excitonic insulator candidate Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
Authors: Yuan-Shan Zhang, Zichen Yang, Chuanlian Xiao, Masahiko Isobe, Matteo Minola, Hidenori Takagi, Dennis Huang
Abstract: Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ continues to draw interest for its 326 K phase transition, whose dual electronic and structural nature reflects a complex interplay of electron-hole (excitonic) and electron-lattice interactions. Most studies that have attempted to decipher the relative importance of these interactions, particularly through charge transfer, have been limited to bulk samples. We utilized a thin-flake approach to modify the excitonic interactions in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ via an underlying film of Au. Using polarized Raman spectroscopy, we found that four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on conducting Au show a transition temperature that is both reduced by over 100 K and broadened due to an interfacial charge gradient effect, manifesting the presence of excitonic interactions. In contrast, four layers of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ supported on insulating Al$_2$O$_3$ show nearly bulk-like properties. We also report the development of an all-dry exfoliation and transfer protocol that generalizes substrate engineering for strongly correlated van der Waals materials.

Title: Tuning molecular thermal conductance through endgroup modification and halogen substitution
Authors: Jonathan J. Wang, Dvira Segal
Abstract: We demonstrate tuning of the phononic thermal conductance in single molecules with carbon-chain backbones through modifications of terminal groups and halogen substitution of hydrogen atoms. Our simulations focus on intrinsic molecular properties, and we employ a workflow based on {\it ab initio} molecular dynamics, enabling the training and development of machine-learned interatomic potentials. These potentials are subsequently used in classical nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to extract thermal conductance coefficients. Replacing terminal methyl groups with amine, sulfur, or halogen substituents leads to pronounced changes in thermal conductance: bromine-terminated chains exhibit the lowest conductance, whereas amine and methyl-terminated chains show the highest. Additionally, single-atom substitution of hydrogen by fluorine or other halogens along the alkane backbone significantly reduces thermal transport. Finally, our simulations of the length dependence of thermal conductance in alkane chains containing 3-12 carbon atoms reveal its saturation beyond eight carbon atoms. Together, our findings show that simple chemical modifications offer a versatile route to controlling phononic heat flow in single molecules.

Title: Many-Body Correlation Effects in Fröhlich Electron-Phonon Coupling
Authors: Zien Zhu, Chih-En Hsu, Benran Zhang, Zhenfa Zheng, Mauro Del Ben, Antonios M. Alvertis, Hung-Chung Hsueh, Zhenglu Li
Abstract: In compound semiconductors and insulators, the polar electron-phonon coupling diverges at long range, known as the Fröhlich interaction. Modern first-principles electron-phonon calculations treat the Fröhlich interaction in a semiclassical electrostatic formalism based on density-functional perturbation theory. Here, using many-body $GW$ perturbation theory, we reveal important electron correlation effects in the Fröhlich-type electron-phonon coupling, which are missed by the prevailing approaches. Going beyond the electrostatic treatment, we derive and implement the $GW$ self-energy contribution to the long-range polar electron-phonon coupling, and demonstrate its critical role and nontrivial behaviors in properties such as electron linewidth and polaron formation. Our work establishes the many-body generalization of the Fröhlich interaction that is essential for accurate electron-phonon calculations at the full $GW$ level combined with Wannier interpolation techniques.

Title: Probing Topological Surface States and Conduction via Extended Defects in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ Films
Authors: Abby Liu, Armando Gil, Moon-ki Choi, Berna Akgenc Hanedar, Zecheng You, Shriya Sinha, Tahsin Hakioglu, Harley T. Johnson, Kai Sun, Roy Clarke, Ctirad Uher, Cagliyan Kurdak, Rachel S. Goldman
Abstract: (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ alloys are non-degenerate topological insulators (TIs) whose Dirac point (DP) can be tuned within the bulk bandgap by varying the composition, effectively reducing bulk conduction while allowing surface carrier conduction. Magnetotransport measurements of a series of (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ thin films indicate electron-dominated conduction, with weak anti-localization attributed to topological surface states (TSSs). Due to the similarity of phase coherence lengths and twin boundary spacings ($\sim$100 nm), we consider the role of twin boundaries as additional conducting paths. Density functional theory calculations reveal an enhanced density of states near the Fermi level at $60^\circ$ twin boundaries, with 2D carrier concentration in excess of $3 \times 10^{13}$ cm$^{-2}$. Furthermore, an analysis of the longitudinal magnetoconductivity yields an upper bound of $7.3 \times 10^{-4}$ S for twin boundary conductivity, resulting in a carrier mobility as high as $142$ cm$^2$/(V$\cdot$s). We discuss the role of twin boundaries in facilitating a transition from a massive Dirac cone dispersion to gapless, topologically protected surface states. Understanding the role of twin boundaries on carrier conduction in non-degenerate TIs is critical for the development of novel TI-based electronic devices.

Title: Strain-induced quantum oscillation in Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana-Fermi surface
Authors: Takayuki Yokoyama, Yasuhiro Tada
Abstract: We theoretically study Landau quantization of itinerant Majorana quasiparticles induced by lattice strain in a Kitaev spin liquid with Majorana Fermi surfaces. We consider the isotropic spin-1/2 Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice with a perturbation such as a staggered Zeeman field and an electromagnetic field, which generates small Majorana Fermi surfaces near the Dirac points. By introducing triaxial strain, we create an effective vector potential that couples to Majorana fermions and leads to Landau quantization. Our calculations show that the low-energy spectrum forms discrete pseudo-Landau levels of the Majorana Fermi surface. We further demonstrate that the strain-induced effective vector potential gives rise to pronounced quantum oscillations of the density of states and the specific heat at very low temperatures, in close analogy to the de Haas-van Alphen effect for charged electrons in metals. These results indicate that Landau-quantization-driven "Majorana quantum oscillations" can serve as a probe of the charge-neutral Majorana Fermi surface in Kitaev materials.

Title: Extreme disorder in crystalline perovskite oxide: a new paradigm in quantum materials research
Authors: Srimanta Middey, Nandana Bhattacharya, Rukma Nevgi, Suresh Chandra Joshi, Subha Dey
Abstract: Perovskite oxides ($AB$O$_3$) have long been central to the advancement of modern condensed matter physics, owing to their rich and tunable electronic and magnetic properties. The quest to understand their various entangled phases has spurred the development of both cutting-edge experimental tools and innovative theoretical frameworks. In recent times, the emergence of high entropy oxides - materials in which five or more elements share a single crystallographic site - has introduced a powerful new paradigm in materials design. Embedding such extreme chemical disorder within the perovskite framework has opened vast opportunities for realizing novel physical phenomena inaccessible in conventional oxides. This review surveys the rapid advances in the synthesis, characterization, and exploration of the electronic and magnetic properties of compositionally complex perovskite oxides, offering key insights and highlighting promising avenues for future research.

Title: A constitutive framework for tension-compression failure asymmetry in soft materials
Authors: Yogesh C. Chandrashekar, Kshitiz Upadhyay
Abstract: Soft materials often exhibit pronounced tension-compression asymmetry (TCA) in their softening and failure behavior, a feature that conventional hyperelastic and continuum-damage formulations fail to capture within a unified framework. This work presents a Lode-invariant-based hyperelastic softening model that explicitly incorporates deformation-mode dependence through a bi-failure construction with distinct tensile and compressive energy limiters. The proposed model extends Volokh's classical energy-limiting approach by embedding a Lode-angle-dependent weighting function, which ensures a smooth and thermodynamically consistent transition of failure behavior across distortion modes, achieved directly within the constitutive description of the bulk response, without introducing internal damage variables. Agarose hydrogels (1, 2, and 3% w/v) serve as the model system for validation. The framework accurately reproduces experimental stress-stretch responses in uniaxial tension and compression, capturing concentration-dependent stiffness and failure energetics. Using parameters calibrated solely from combined uniaxial data, the model predicts pure shear behavior, including softening and failure, demonstrating strong cross-mode generalizability. To further assess thermodynamic stability and deformation-mode sensitivity, the model's energy landscape was analyzed across the Lode-invariant space, confirming stable behavior under diverse loading conditions. Parameter evolution with concentration follows power-law scaling, enabling interpolation and predictive validation at intermediate concentrations (2.5% w/v). By establishing a physically interpretable damage framework over the Lode invariant space, this work provides a unified framework for tension-compression-asymmetric softening and lays the foundation for distortional-mode-sensitive, three-dimensional failure mapping of soft materials.

Title: Thermoelectric properties of SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) Janus layers
Authors: M. Vallinayagam, A. E. Sudheer, A. Kumar, G. Tejaswini, M. Posselt, C. Kamal, D. Murali, M. Zschornak
Abstract: We report a comprehensive investigation of the thermoelectric properties of SbXY (X = Se, Te; Y = Br, I) Janus layers (JL) using spin-polarized first-principles calculations. Ab initio molecular dynamics confirm that the 1T phase ($Pm31$) remains stable up to 1000 K, excluding any phase transitions. The calculated mean-square displacement further evidences the structural robustness. The thermal conductivity is strongly suppressed in Br-containing layers due to enhanced Froehlich interactions between optical and acoustic phonons. Electronic structure calculations reveal indirect band gaps of 1.1 to 1.3 eV, with valence and conduction bands dominated by the $p$-orbitals of halogen/chalcogen and of Sb, respectively. The carrier effective mass highlights anisotropic transport with lighter electrons being more mobile, while holes dominate the power factor, which attains values on the order of mW/mK$^2$. Direction-dependent transport indicates superior thermoelectric performance along the $xx$ direction, with negligible contribution along $yy$. The Figure of Merit reaches 0.6 at 1000 K in hole-doped SbSeBr, demonstrating strong potential for high-temperature applications. Our results reveal that the SbXY JLs, particularly SbSeBr, emerge as promising candidates for next-generation thermoelectric devices at elevated temperatures.

Title: From chessboard of bipolarons of size 4a in cubic La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 to stripes of the same bipolarons in layered high Tc cuprates
Authors: Martine Hennion (1), Alexandre Ivanov (2), Claudine Lacroix (3), Bernard Hennion (1) ((1) Laboratoire Léon Brillouin, Gif-sur-Yvette, France (2) Institut Laue-Langevin, Grenoble, France (3) Institut Néel, Grenoble, France)
Abstract: The compound La1-xSrxMnO3 exhibits a charge order (CO) state at $x\approx 1/8$ and $T<T_{co}$, which recalls the CO state with a decrease in the temperature of the superconducting transition, $T_c$, observed in all cuprates at this doping value. Local excitations of lattice and magnetic origins measured in the two-dimensional metallic state of La7/8Sr1/8MnO3 reveal the existence of bipolarons of size $4a$ resulting from structural and antiferromagnetic pairings of hole-rich orbital polarons of size $2a$. They are intertwined with hole-poor domains in a disordered state at $T>T_{co}$ which become ordered on a chessboard organized in a 3D-order state of ferromagnetically paired polarons at $T<T_{co}$. Applied to the CuO$_2$ planes of the cuprates of the "214" family, this model produces stripes of bipolarons intertwined with stripes of antiferromagnetically arranged spins, hole-poor, both of size $4a$, leading to a spin density wave with a wave vector $\delta=1/8$, a charge density wave with $q=1/4$, the Yamada laws $\delta(x)=x$ and $T_c\propto \delta$ and a decrease of $T_c$ at x=1/8. This work invokes relevance of a bipolaronic origin of high $T_c$ superconductivity, in which bipolarons of size $4a$ can play a major role.

Title: The generalized density of states in a one-dimensional Ising model with ferrromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions
Authors: Boris Kryzhanovsky, Vladislav Egorov
Abstract: Expressions for the density of states $D(E)$, where $D(E)$ is the number of states of energy $E$, are well known. The present paper offers the expressions for generalized density of states $D_N(E,m)$, where $D_N(E,m)$ is the number of states with energy $E$ and magnetization $m$ in a one-dimensional $N$-spin chain. The expressions obtained here can be considered as reference ones, since all the main characteristics were obtained without them: using the transfer matrix technique or using well-known expressions for the density of states $D(E)=\sum_m{D_N(E,m)}$. Nevertheless, the knowledge of quantity $D_N(E,m)$ helps to understand the model properties and allows the analysis of the temporal behavior of magnetization $m=m(\tau)$. In particular, we demonstrate that in a one-dimensional model spontaneous magnetization can be observed at a non-zero temperature. However, the spontaneous magnetization can randomly change its sign, which results in the magnetization averaged over a very long observation period becoming zero $\langle m(\tau)\rangle$.

Title: A geometric approach to predicting plasticity in disordered solids
Authors: Long-Zhou Huang, Xu Yang, Min-Qiang Jiang, Yun-Jiang Wang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: It was recently shown that vortex-like topological defects with negative winding number in the vibrational modes of a two-dimensional glass under quasistatic shear correlate strongly with plastic events, offering a promising route to predict them. However, many of these vortices, a number that actually grows quadratically with mode frequency, are entirely unrelated to plasticity and arise simply from the underlying plane-wave structure of the modes. This raises doubts about the fundamental relevance of such defects to plastic rearrangements and limits their predictive power. Here, we introduce a geometrical filter based on the Nye dislocation density that, when applied to the vibrational modes, removes these spurious defects and reveals the true plastic precursors. Using simulations of a two-dimensional model glass, we show that this filtered approach consistently outperforms the conventional vortex-based method, particularly at small strains and when focusing on genuine plastic stress drops, offering a more robust tool to predicting plasticity in glasses from their undeformed initial state.

Title: Probing the Crossover between Dynamical Phases with Local Correlations in a Rydberg Atom Array
Authors: Xiaofeng Wu, Xin Wang, Sixun Jia, Bo Xiong
Abstract: The experimental detection of non-equilibrium quantum criticality remains a challenge, as traditional signatures like dynamical quantum phase transitions rely on hard-to-measure global properties. Here, we demonstrate that local connected correlation functions provide a superior, practical means to directly probe the dynamics of magnetic order in a quenched Rydberg atom array. Using a Magnus expansion formalism, we derive analytic expressions for these correlations that capture a smooth crossover from antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic dominance. Our analytic results, which reveal the critical parameter relationship $U_{c}(\delta)$, are validated against exact numerical simulations and exhibit robustness to finite-size effects. By shifting the focus from global singularities to local correlations, our protocol establishes a direct and feasible path to observe the rich critical dynamics in scalable quantum simulators.

Title: Electrically Tuneable Variability in Germanium Hole Spin Qubits
Authors: Edmondo Valvo, Michele Jakob, Patrick Del Vecchio, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Hole spin qubits in planar germanium heterostructures are frontrunners for scalable semiconductor quantum computing. However, their current performance is mostly limited by large dot-to-dot variability that leads to uncontrolled qubit energies and random tilts in the spin quantization axis. Here, we propose a systematic and local method to engineer the spin qubit response by imprinting a controlled anisotropy in the quantum dot confinement, enabling on-demand electric g-tensor control. In particular, we find that both the quantum-dot size and asymmetry allow electrical tuning of the g-tensor and significantly suppress magnitude and angular variability of the spin response for selected magnetic field directions. We confirm this behavior by analyzing single-disorder realizations and statistical ensembles in state-of-the-art strained and unstrained germanium channels, showing that the latter provides an optimal path for $g$-tensor engineering. Our results provide practical design principles for on-demand control of the spin response and mitigating variability, paving the way towards large-scale germanium-based quantum computers.

Title: Plasma engineered Hydroxyl Defects in NiO a DFTSupported-Spectroscopic Analysis of Oxygen Hole States and Implications for Water Oxidation

Abstract: Controlling lattice oxygen reactivity in earth abundant OER catalysts requires precise tuning of defect chemistry in the oxide lattice. Here, we combine DFT+U calculations with plasma assisted synthesis to show how O2 and H2O in the discharge govern vacancy formation, electronic structure, and catalytic predisposition in NiO thin films. Oxygen rich plasmas generate isolated and clustered Ni vacancies that stabilize oxygen ligand hole states and produce shallow O 2p Ni 3d hybrid levels, enhancing Ni O covalency. In contrast, introducing H2O during growth drives local hydroxylation that compensates vacancy induced Ni3+ centers, restoring Ni2+ like coordination, suppressing deep divacancy derived in gap states, and introducing shallow Ni O H derived valence-band tails. EXAFS confirms that hydroxylation perturbs only the local environment while preserving the medium-range NiO lattice, and Ni L-edge spectroscopy shows a persistent but redistributed ligand-hole population. These complementary vacancy and hydroxylation driven pathways provide a plasma controlled route to pre define electronic defect landscapes in NiO and to tune its activation toward OER relevant NiOOH formation.

Title: Electrical Readout Strategies of GFET Biosensors for Real-World Requirements
Authors: Michael Geiwitz, Owen Rivers Page, Marina E. Nichols, Tio Marello, Catherine Hoar, Deji Akinwande, Michelle M. Meyer, Kenneth S. Burch
Abstract: Graphene Field-Effect Transistors (GFETs) are increasingly employed as biochemical sensors due to their exceptional electronic properties, surface sensitivity, and potential for miniaturization. A critical challenge in deploying GFETs is determining the optimal electrical readout strategy. GFETs are typically operated with either of two modalities: one measuring current in real time (amperometric) and the other monitoring the change in voltage for charge neutrality (potential potentiometric). Here, we undertake a systematic study of the two modalities to determine their relative advantages/disadvantages towards guiding the future use of GFETs in sensing. We focus on viral proteins in wastewater, given the matrix's complexity and the growing interest in the field of wastewater surveillance. Our results show that transconductance offers far superior limits of detection (LOD) but suffers from limited reproducibility, a narrower dynamic range, and is ineffective for some viral proteins. In comparison, we find that Dirac point tracking offers higher reproducibility and superior robustness, but at a higher LOD. Interestingly, both techniques exhibit similar sensitivity, highlighting the importance of the aptamers employed. Systematic experiments also help explain differences in dynamic range and limited functionality in detecting some proteins, resulting from hidden electrophoresis, and shifting the high transconductance point away from the active region. Thus, our findings provide crucial considerations for designing and operating resilient graphene biosensors suitable for real-time pathogen monitoring in environmental scenarios.

Title: Fast wave transport in two-dimensional $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices
Authors: Sayan Jana, Lea Sirota
Abstract: We present a theoretical investigation of wave dynamics in two-dimensional non-Hermitian $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric lattices, where onsite, as well as inter-site control couplings are employed. Our analysis shows that these couplings can be tuned to achieve a direction-sensitive group velocity enhancement beyond what is possible in the uncontrolled (Hermitian) counterpart, while ensuring that the wave packet evolution remains bounded and dynamically stable. We derive a dedicated relation between the control parameters, providing a systematic condition under which stability is guaranteed. We then study the topological properties of the non-Hermitian system at hand, and use an experimental-ready topoelecric metamaterial platform to demonstrate the non-Hermitian couplings realization, and the resulting wave dynamics. This framework paves the way to designing stable and fast wave transport in planar non-Hermitian media.

Abstract: The discovery of high-T$_c$ superconductor in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate materials represented by La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has opened new directions in the quest for unconventional superconductivity. A central unresolved issue concerns the pairing symmetry of the superconducting order. In this paper, we model the superconducting order of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ using the established Fermi surface structure together with phenomenological pairing functions belonging to $s_\pm$ and $d$-wave symmetry classes, which are the leading possibilities in the current debate. We compute several experimentally accessible observables-including tunneling density of states, point contact spectroscopy, superfluid density, and Raman spectroscopy-each of which exhibits distinct characteristics for different gap symmetries. These quantities provide a concrete and experimentally testable route for identifying the pairing symmetry of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and for clarifying the microscopic nature of nickelate superconductivity.

Title: Proximity effects and a topological invariant in a Chern insulator connected to leads
Authors: Satyam Sinha, Rekha Kumari, Junaid Majeed Bhat, Abhishek Dhar, R. Shankar
Abstract: The observed robustly quantized Hall conductance in quantum Hall systems and Chern insulators (CI) have so far been understood in terms of the topology of isolated systems, which are not coupled to leads. It is assumed that the leads act as inert reservoirs that simply supply/absorb electrons to/from the sample. Within a model of a CI coupled to leads with a cylindrical geometry, we show that this is not true. In the proximity of the CI, the edge current leaks into the leads, with the Hall conductance quantized only if this novel proximity effect is taken into account. For a special choice of leads, we identify the conductance with a topological invariant of the system, in terms of the winding number of the phase of the reflection coefficients of the scattering states.

Title: Basis Adaptive Algorithm for Quantum Many-Body Systems on Quantum Computers
Authors: Anutosh Biswas, Sayan Ghosh, Ritajit Majumdar, Mostafizur Rahaman, Manoranjan Kumar
Abstract: A new basis adaptive algorithm for hybrid quantum-classical platforms is introduced to efficiently find the ground-state (gs) properties of quantum many-body systems. The method addresses limitations of many algorithms, such as Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) and Quantum Phase Estimation (QPE) etc by using shallow Trotterized circuits for short real-time evolution on a quantum processor. The sampled basis is then symmetry-filtered by using various symmetries of the Hamiltonian which is then classically diagonalized in the reduced Hilbert space. We benchmark this approach on the spin-1/2 XXZ chain up to 24 qubits using the IBM Heron processor. The algorithm achieves sub-percent accuracy in ground-state energies across various anisotropy regimes. Crucially, it outperforms the Sampling Krylov Quantum Diagonalization (SKQD) method, demonstrating a substantially lower energy error for comparable reduced-space dimensions. This work validates symmetry-filtered, real-time sampling as a robust and efficient path for studying correlated quantum systems on current near-term hardware.

Title: From Frequency Dependent Specific Heat to Fictive Temperature of a Glassy Liquid
Authors: Biman Bagchi
Abstract: Upon rapid quenching of temperature of a glass forming liquid, the system falls out of equilibrium due its finite relaxation time. Additionally, the relaxation becomes progressively slower with time. The created nonequilibrium state of the glassy system is conveniently described by introducing a fictive temperature which provides the instantaneous state of the nonequilibrium system. The fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$ is time dependent. During cooling, the fictive temperature is higher than the actual temperature. After the cooling or quenching has ceased, the fictive temperature approaches the final temperature at a rate that depends on the relaxation properties of the liquid. In this work we use linear response theory to connect the time dependence of the fictive temperature to memory function which is shown to be related to the frequency dependent specific heat which itself depends on the fictive temperature $T_{f} (t)$. Thus, one requires { \it a self-consistent calculation} to capture the interdependence of relaxation rate and structural response function. We present a numerical calculation where we apply our relations to silica where the relaxation function that describes the frequency dependent specific heat and is modeled as a stretched exponential William-Watts (WW) function, while the relaxation time is modeled as a Vogel-Fulcher-Tammann (VFT). We calculate the fictive temperature self-consistently. $T_{f}(t)$ exhibits the fall out from actual temperature as time (t) progresses.

Title: Universal splitting of phase transitions and performance optimization in driven collective systems
Authors: Gustavo A. L. Forão, Jonas Berx, Tan Van Vu, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a hallmark of equilibrium systems, typically characterized by a single critical point separating ordered and disordered phases. Recently, a novel class of non-equilibrium phase transitions was uncovered [Phys. Rev. Res. {\bf 7}, L032049 (2025)], showing that the combined effects of simultaneous contact with thermal baths at different temperatures and external driving forces can split the conventional order-disorder transition into two distinct critical points, determined by which ordered state initially dominates. We show the robustness of this phenomenon by extending a minimal interacting-spin model from the idealized case of simultaneous bath coupling to a finite-time coupling protocol. In particular, we introduce two protocols in which the system interacts with a single bath at a time: a stochastic protocol, where the system randomly switches between the baths at different temperatures, and a deterministic protocol where the coupling alternates periodically. Our analysis reveals two key results: (i) the splitting of phase transitions persists across all coupling schemes -- simultaneous, stochastic, and deterministic -- and (ii) different optimizations of power and efficiency in a collectively operating heat engine reveal that both the stochastic and deterministic protocols exhibit superior global performance at intermediate switching rates and periods when compared to simultaneous coupling. The global trade-off between power and efficiency is described by an expression solely depending on the temperatures of thermal reservoirs as the efficiency approaches to the ideal limit.

Title: Hund's coupling driven nature of magnetism in negative charge transfer material, $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$
Authors: Jyotsana Sharma, Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K Pandey
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the microscopic origin of magnetism in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$ by incorporating electronic correlations within the dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) framework. We note a remarkable agreement of the calculated magnetic observables ( saturation magnetization $\sim$2.4 $\mu_B$; magnetic transition temperature, $T_c$$\sim$350 K) with the experimental results. The system exhibits Hund's coupling-induced strong quasiparticle mass enhancements of upto $m^*/m$ $\sim$7 for Co 3$d$ states, with the largest renormalization occurring in the majority spin $t_{2g}$ orbitals, marking the onset of orbital-selectivity. Our results reveal a Stoner-$like$ collapse of exchange splitting that drives the loss of long-range ferromagnetic order at $T_c$. The breakdown of Fermi-liquid behavior down to $T$$\sim$100 K suggests a suppressed coherence scale. Local magnetic moment originates from a mixed-spin configuration formed through dynamical fluctuation between intermediate-spin and high-spin states. Large charge fluctuations ($\langle$$\Delta$N$^2$$\rangle$$\sim$0.6) together with heavy quasiparticles establish the correlation effects regime, governed predominantly by Hund's physics in $\mathrm{SrCoO_3}$.

Title: Observation of magnetically coupled electro-optic effect in LiNbO3/LiTaO3 at room temperature
Authors: Yalong Yu, Hengwei Zhang, Xiaoyan Liu, Tao Chu
Abstract: The magnetoelectric coupling effect serves as a crucial bridge between electrical and magnetic order parameters in condensed matter physics, forming the physical basis for the development of next-generation low-power information storage and sensing technologies. However, material systems exhibiting this effect at room temperature are extremely rare, and the coupling strength is typically very weak, which has long hindered the practical application of such phenomena despite their rich tunability. Here, we break this by reporting a pronounced magnetoelectric phenomenon,the magnetically coupled EO effect in the classic ferroelectric optical materials LiNbO3 and LiTaO3. We trace its origin to an unexpected source,the problematic direct current drift,a major reliability issue in photonic integrated circuits. We unambiguously demonstrate that this drift stems not from mobile ions but from defect-bound unpaired electrons, whose slow polarization relaxation is quenched upon the magnetic-field-induced formation of a room-temperature skyrmion states, as directly visualized by Lorentz transmission electron microscopy. This collective spin ordering not only solves the decades-old drift problem but also transforms the defect states into a magnetically responsive platform, exhibiting an efficiency up to 34 pm/V in LiNbO3 and 15 pm/V in LiTaO3-an orders-of-magnitude enhancement over conventional room-temperature magnetoelectric responses and even surpassing the materials' intrinsic Pockels coefficients. We also measured the magnetic response of this additional electro-optical effect and found that under the condition of applying a magnetic field of 0.1 T, an electro-optical coefficient adjustment of about 8 pm/V can be achieved (0.008 pm/V/Oe), which is equivalent to 30% of the electro-optical coefficient of LiNbO3 itself.

Title: To crack, or not to crack: How hydrogen favors crack propagation in iron at the atomic scale
Authors: Aleksei Egorov, Lei Zhang, Erik van der Giessen, Francesco Maresca
Abstract: Steel is a key structural material because of its considerable strength and ductility. However, when exposed to hydrogen, it is prone to embrittlement. Mechanistic understanding of the origin of hydrogen embrittlement is hampered by the lack of reliable interatomic potentials. Here, we perform large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of crack propagation after having developed and validated an efficient yet density-functional-theory-accurate machine-learning potential for hydrogen in iron. Simulations based on our potential reveal that in the absence of H, iron is intrinsically ductile at finite temperatures with crack-tip blunting assisted by dislocation emission. By contrast, minute (part-per-million) hydrogen concentrations can switch the crack-tip behavior from ductile blunting to brittle propagation. Detailed analysis of our molecular dynamics results reveals that the combination of fast hydrogen diffusion and diminished surface energy is at the origin of embrittlement. Our results set the stage for a modified Griffith's criterion for hydrogen-induced brittle fracture, which closely captures the simulations and that can be used to assess embrittlement in iron-based alloys.

Title: Crossover Dynamics of Non-Fickian Ionic Diffusion in Solids
Authors: Gangbin Yan, Pierfrancesco Ombrini, Zhichu Tang, Shakul Pathak, Maoyu Wang, Barbara Lavina, Alexandros Vasileiadis, Suin Choi, Mingzhan Wang, Dongchen Ying, Qizhang Li, Esen E. Alp, Hua Zhou, Martin Z. Bazant, Qian Chen, Marnix Wagemaker, Chong Liu
Abstract: Ionic diffusion in solids is central to energy storage, electronics, and catalysis, yet its chemical origins are difficult to resolve because conventional diffusion models struggle with effects of confinement, crystallographic disorder, lattice distortions, and coupling to electronic or phononic carriers. These challenges are especially pronounced in battery materials, where ionic and electronic motion occur together, complicating interpretation of electrochemical measurements. Here we use tracer exchange as a direct, non-electrochemical probe to reveal distinct ion-transport regimes in the one-dimensional conductor olivine Li_xFePO4 (0 <= x <= 1). Lithium isotope exchange validates single-file diffusion governed by strong ion-ion correlations, where 1D confinement suppresses bypassing and preserves spatial order. Kinetic Monte Carlo simulations and chronoamperometry quantify both Faradaic and non-Faradaic surface exchange, identifying electron transport, rather than Li+ mobility, as the rate-limiting step for electrochemical reaction. In addition, Li-Na exchange exhibits apparent superdiffusion, with rates that increase with Na content. Simulations attribute this behavior to surface-exchange limitations and Na-induced lattice strain that enhances cross-channel Li+ hopping and drives a crossover from 1D to quasi-2D transport. Four-dimensional STEM, in situ synchrotron XRD, X-ray absorption spectroscopy, and Mossbauer spectroscopy confirm that lattice softening and concerted polaron motion contribute to the observed dynamics. These results establish tracer exchange as a powerful tool for probing coupled ion-electron transport and provide chemical insight into how lattice mechanics and multicomponent exchange shape ionic diffusion in solids.

Title: Magnetic topological textures in nonorientable surfaces
Authors: Carlos Saji, Mario A. Castro, Vagson L. Carvalho-Santos, Eduardo Saavedra, Alvaro S. Nunez, Roberto E. Troncoso
Abstract: Topological magnetic textures confined to two-dimensional (2D) non-orientable manifolds exhibit behaviors absent in planar systems. We investigate bimerons on Möbius surfaces and show that the lack of global orientation alters conservation laws, yielding geometry-dependent topology and dynamics. Micromagnetic simulations reveal that the helical twist and non-orientable geometry reshape the effective topological charge and stabilize chiral configurations imposed by the surface. Under spin-polarized currents, bimerons display unconventional transport: the transverse response is locally reversed or globally suppressed due to charge inversion along the manifold. Moreover, we establish an Aharonov-Bohm effect associated with the magnonic modes of the texture; in particular, the translational Goldstone mode implies that a bimeron on a Möbius strip should exhibit path-dependent quantum interference. These results identify a geometry-driven regime of magnetization dynamics and provide a route to curvature-engineered spintronic functionalities.

Title: Magnetic field-tuned size and dual annihilation pathways of chiral magnetic bobbers
Authors: S. Y. Lu, Y. F. Duan, D. X. Yu, H. M. Dong
Abstract: Magnetic chiral bobbers (CBs) are three-dimensional (3D) topological spin textures that consist of a tapered skyrmion tube terminating in a Bloch point, promising applications in high-density spintronics. However, the mechanisms controlling their size and the dynamics of their annihilation are still not fully understood. In this study, we present an analytical model that predicts the radius $R$ of the CB as a function of the external magnetic field, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI), the magnetic anisotropy, and the exchange interaction. The micromagnetic simulations validate this model across a broad range of parameters. We also identify two mechanisms of annihilation of CBs: (i) a droplet-like instability that occurs under rapid changes in the magnetic field, which we describe using a proposed magnetic Weber number $We$ and its critical field step scaling; and (ii) Bloch point depinning mechanism at interfaces, for which we determine the threshold magnetic field $B_{\text{th}}$ for annihilation. Importantly, we uncover a novel fragmentation pathway in which CBs transform into skyrmion tubes, then into half-CBs, and finally into ferromagnetic states. These findings lay the groundwork for understanding and manipulating 3D CBs as next-generation devices.

Title: Transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles
Authors: Shuai He, Junxing Pan, Jinjun Zhang
Abstract: Polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles have significant application value in fields such as gene therapy and targeted drug delivery. A profound understanding of the interaction mechanisms between these particles and cell membranes represents a critical scientific challenge in biophysics. Using the Self-Consistent Field Theory, this work systematically explores the transmembrane transport of polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles into giant vesicles. The impacts of critical parameters-polymer brush grafting density, nanoparticle size, and giant vesicle membrane thickness-on transport behavior are comprehensively elucidated. The findings reveal two distinct transmembrane transport mechanisms for polymer brush-grafted nanoparticles, which are governed by membrane thickness and grafting density. At high grafting density, the nanoparticles undergo direct transmembrane translocation; at low grafting density, transport occurs via endocytosis. Thermodynamic analysis identifies entropy as the dominant driving force for this process.

Title: Observation of a Stripe/nematic Phase of Composite Fermions
Authors: Chengyu Wang, Siddharth K. Singh, Chia-Tse Tai, Adbhut Gupta, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Kirk W. Baldwin, Mansour Shayegan
Abstract: Electronic stripe/nematic phases are fascinating strongly-correlated states characterized by spontaneous rotational symmetry breaking. In the quantum Hall regime, such phases typically emerge at half-filled, high-orbital-index ($N\geq2$) Landau levels (LLs) where the short-range Coulomb interaction is softened by the nodes of electron wave functions. In the lowest ($N=0$) LLs, these phases are not expected. Instead, composite fermion (CF) liquids and fractional quantum Hall states, which are well explained in the picture of weakly interacting CF quasiparticles, are favored. Here we report the observation of an unexpected stripe/nematic phase in the \textit{lowest} LL at filling factor $\nu=5/8$ in ultrahigh-quality GaAs two-dimensional \textit{hole} systems, evinced by a pronounced in-plane transport anisotropy. Remarkably, $\nu=5/8$ can be mapped to a half-filled, high-index CF LL ($N_{\text{CF}}=2$), analogous to the $N=2$ hole LL. Our finding signals a novel stripe/nematic phase of CFs, driven by the residual long-range interaction among these emergent quasiparticles. This phase is surprisingly robust, surviving up to $\sim$100 mK. Its absence in electron-type systems suggests that severe LL mixing stemming from the large hole effective mass and non-linear LL fan diagram plays a crucial role in modifying the CF-CF interaction.

Title: Experimental Demonstration and Transformation Mechanism of Quenchable Two-dimensional Diamond

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) diamond has aroused tremendous interest in nanoelectronics and optoelectronics, owing to its superior properties and flexible characteristics compared to bulk diamond. Despite significant efforts, great challenges lie in the experimental synthesis and transformation conditions of 2D diamond. Herein, we have demonstrated the experimental preparation of high quality 2D diamond with controlled thickness and distinguished properties, realized by laser-heating few-layer graphene in diamond anvil cell. The quenched 2D diamond exhibited narrow T2g Raman peak (linewidth ~3.6 cm-1) and intense photoluminescence of SiV- (linewidth ~6.1 nm) and NV0 centers. In terms of transformation mechanism, atomic structures of hybrid phase interfaces suggested that the intermediate rhombohedral phase subtly mediate hexagonal graphite to cubic diamond transition. Furthermore, the tunable optical bandgap and thermal stability of 2D diamond sensitively depend on its sp3 concentration. We believe our results can shed light on the structural design and preparation of many carbon allotropes and further uncover the underlying transition mechanism.

Title: Hyperuniform patterns nucleated at low temperatures: Insight from vortex matter imaged in unprecedentedly large fields-of-view
Authors: Alexey Cruz-García, Joaquín Puig, Sergii Pylypenko, Gladys Nieva, Alain Pautraut, Alejandro Benedykt Kolton, Yanina Fasano
Abstract: Hyperuniform patterns present enhanced physical properties that make them the new generation of cutting-edge technological devices. Synthesizing devices with tens of thousands of components arranged in a hyperuniform fashion has thus become a breakthrough to achieve in order to implement these technologies. Here we provide evidence that extended two-dimensional hyperuniform patterns spanning tens of thousands of components can be nucleated using as a template the low-temperature vortex structure obtained in pristine Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 samples after following a field-cooling protocol.

Title: Predicting the Thermal Conductivity Collapse in SWCNT Bundles: The Interplay of Symmetry Breaking and Scattering Revealed by Machine-Learning-Driven Quantum Transport
Authors: Feng Tao, Xiaoliang Zhang, Dawei Tang, Shigeo Maruyama, Ya Feng
Abstract: We combine machine learning (ML)-based neuroevolution potentials (NEP) with anharmonic lattice dynamics and the Boltzmann transport equation (ALD-BTE) to achieve a quantitative and mode-resolved description of thermal transport in individual (10, 0) zigzag single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) and their bundles. Our analysis reveals a dual mechanism behind the drastic suppression of thermal conductivity in bundles: first, the breaking of rotational symmetry in isolated SWCNTs dramatically enhances the scattering rates of symmetry-sensitive phonon modes, such as the twist (TW) mode. Second, the emergence of new inter-tube phonon modes introduces abundant additional scattering channels across the entire frequency spectrum. Crucially, the incorporation of quantum Bose-Einstein (BE) statistics is essential to accurately capture these phenomena, enabling our approach to quantitatively reproduce experimental observations. This work establishes the combination of ML-driven interatomic potentials and ALD-BTE as a predictive framework for nanoscale thermal transport, effectively bridging the gap between theoretical models and experimental measurements.

Title: Phase-field simulation of domain switching in ferroelectric trilayer films under bending-induced strain gradient
Authors: Changqing Guo, Letao Yang, Jing Wang, Houbing Huang
Abstract: Flexible ferroelectrics possess significant potential for wearable electronics and bio-inspired devices, yet their electromechanical coupling mechanisms under dynamic bending remain elusive. This study employs phase-field simulations to investigate the effects of bending deformation on domain structures and macroscopic ferroelectric responses in (SrTiO3)10/(PbTiO3)10/(SrTiO3)10 trilayer films. By constructing computational models for upward-concave (U-shaped) and downward-concave (N-shaped) configurations, we analyze the regulation of polarization patterns by strain distributions under varying curvature radii. The results demonstrate that the two bending modes generate opposite through-thickness strain gradients: U-shaped bending produces compressive strain in the upper layer and tensile strain in the lower, while N-shaped bending yields the reverse. These inhomogeneous strains drive distinct polarization reconfigurations within the PTO layer. While stable vortex-antivortex pairs persist at moderate curvatures, reducing the bending radius triggers divergent topological transitions -- U-shaped bending transforms vortex pairs into zigzag-like domains, whereas N-shaped bending promotes out-of-plane c-domain evolution. Crucially, bending-induced strain gradients generate transverse flexoelectric fields that markedly modulate hysteresis loops. U-shaped bending introduces a negative flexoelectric field, shifting loops rightward and suppressing maximum polarization Pmax. In contrast, N-shaped bending generates a positive field, shifting loops leftward and enhancing Pmax. Furthermore, analysis of polarization switching reveals that bending mediates domain-evolution pathways and reversal dynamics.

Title: Non-linear transport in field-induced insulating states of graphite
Authors: Masashi Tokunaga, Kazuto Akiba, Hiroshi Yaguchi, Akira Matsuo, Koichi Kindo
Abstract: Graphite exhibits multi-stage phase transitions in the quantum-limit states realized by magnetic fields applied along the c-axis. Despite extensive studies on this phenomenon, the origin remains a matter of debate to this day. We performed high-field magnetotransport measurements on single crystals of graphite, focusing on the non-linear conductivity in pulsed-magnetic fields of up to 75 T. The longitudinal magnetoresistance exhibits distinct non-linearity not only in the first but also in the second field-induced phases.

Title: Electric fields induced spin and/or valley polarization in Weiss oscillations of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$
Authors: Y. Li, W. Zeng, R. Shen
Abstract: Monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ exhibits spin- and valley-dependent massive tilted Dirac cones with two velocity correction terms in low-energy effective Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate the longitudinal diffusive magneto-conductivity of monolayer 1{\it T}$^{\prime}$-$\mathrm{MoS}_{2}$ by using the linear response theory. It is shown that the Weiss oscillations are polarized in spin and valley degrees of freedom, under uniform electric fields and a weak one-dimensional spatially-periodic electrostatic potential modulation. The spin polarization, the valley polarization and the spin-valley polarization can be switched by flipping the external electric fields. The polarization is found not only in the amplitudes but also in the periods of the Weiss oscillations. It is found that the period polarization in Weiss oscillations originates from the polarized effective Fermi energies or the polarized Landau level spacing scales. In Weiss oscillations, polarization in amplitude does not imply the presence of polarization in period, whereas polarization in period is accompanied by polarization in amplitude. The superposition of polarization in amplitude and polarization in period enables the appearance of considerable polarization in Weiss oscillations under relatively weak external electric fields.

Title: The interplay of magnetic order with the electronic scattering and crystal-field effects in a metallic ferromagnet
Authors: Payel Shee, Tanaya Halder, Chia-Jung Yang, Nainish Tickoo, Ratiranjan Samal, Ruta Kulkarni, Shishir K. Pandey, Vikas Kashid, Ashis K. Nandy, Arumugam Thamizhavel, Anamitra Mukherjee, Shovon Pal
Abstract: The interplay between magnetic order, charge dynamics, and crystal field excitations underpins the emergent ground states of rare-earth intermetallics. Using time-domain terahertz spectroscopy, we probe this coupling in PrSi, a metallic ferromagnet. The optical response exhibits pronounced Drude-Smith behavior over a broad temperature range, indicating persistent carrier scattering. A classical Kondo-lattice model (CKLM) attributes this non-Drude conductivity to scattering of itinerant electrons by localized magnetic moments, persisting down to temperatures well below the magnetic ordering scale. At lower temperatures, beyond the scope of CKLM, our experiment reveals that the response is dominated by crystal-field excitations, with sharp transitions at 0.6 THz and 1.54 THz. The mode at 1.54 THz shows a dynamic correlation with the onset of ferromagnetic order, marking the onset of a crystal-field-governed low temperature regime.

Title: Enhanced THz emission and exciton transfer in monolayer MoS2/GaAs heterostructures
Authors: C. Abinash Bhuyan, Anil K. Chaudhary, Kishore K. Madapu, P. Naveen Kumar, Sandip Dhara
Abstract: For designing an efficient terahertz (THz) emitter, the defect density of the semiconductors is smartly increased to reduce carrier lifetime, which subsequently lowers the overall power output of the semiconductor. To overcome this fundamental trade-off, this study presents a novel approach, by integrating a direct band gap 2D semiconductor such as monolayer MoS2 (1L-MoS2) with a well-known THz emitter, low-temperature-grown gallium arsenide (GaAs). The fabricated hybrid 2D/3D vertical van der Waals heterostructure showed a 15% higher THz emission compared to bare GaAs due to phase-coherent addition of second-order non-linear susceptibility, and overall enhancement in the electric field of laser. The photoluminescence (PL) enhancement factor of 2.38 in heterostructures at GaAs emission energy of 1.42 eV. However, the substantial quenching of PL emission for 1L-MoS2 at the energy of 1.84 eV, is attributed to the Dexter-type exciton transfer mechanism at type-I band alignment. THz time-domain spectroscopy reveals a significant increase in optoelectronic properties, such as optical conductivity becoming doubled, and a 50% reduction in absorption coefficients. The study introduces a new route for fabricating large-area and compact mixed-dimensional van der Waals heterostructures, which can be used to enhance the efficiency of conventional semiconductor technologies and THz-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Unidirectional gliding of a cycloidal spin structure by an AC magnetic field
Authors: Dong Hui Han, Kyoung-Woong Moon, Kab-Jin Kim, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: The dynamics of a cycloidal spin structure driven by an AC magnetic field is theoretically studied in the weak-field limit. A specific model Hamiltonian describing the cycloidal spin structure in a ferromagnetic thin film is constructed, and its dynamics is analyzed using the collective-coordinate approach within the Lagrangian formalism. We demonstrate that the cycloidal spin structure exhibits a unidirectional gliding motion under an AC magnetic field, and an expression for the average velocity is derived as a function of the magnitude, the direction, and the frequency of the AC magnetic field. We compare our theoretical predictions with the results of micromagnetic simulations and identify two resonance frequencies determined by the eigenenergies of the excitation modes. Furthermore, evaluating spin motive forces induced by the dynamics reveals a substantial DC voltage, which may be exploited in energy-harvesting devices utilizing ambient electromagnetic radiation.

Title: Non-thermal pairing glue of electrons in the steady state
Authors: Michele Pini, Christian H. Johansen, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: The study of mechanisms for enhancing superconductivity has been a central topic in condensed matter physics due to the combination of fundamental and technological interests. One promising route is to exploit non-equilibrium effects in the steady state. Efforts in this direction have so far focused on enhancing the pairing mechanism known from thermal equilibrium through modified distributions for the electrons or the bosons mediating the electron-electron interaction. In this work, we identify an additional pairing mechanism that is active only outside thermal equilibrium. By generalizing Eliashberg theory to non-equilibrium steady states using the Keldysh formalism, we derive a set of Eliashberg equations that capture the effect of this genuinely non-thermal pairing glue even in the weak-coupling regime. We discuss two examples where this mechanism has a major impact. First, in a temperature-bias setup, we find that superconductivity is enhanced when the boson mediator is colder than the electrons. Second, we find that an incoherent drive of the boson mediator at energies much greater than the temperature pushes the system far from thermal equilibrium but leaves the critical coupling essentially unchanged, owing to a competition between electron heating and the enhancement of pairing by the non-thermal glue.

Title: 3D lattice Monte Carlo modeling of morphology formation of Si/SiOx nanocomposites during phase separation of nonstoichiometric Si oxide films
Authors: Ivan Oliinyk, Andrey Sarikov
Abstract: In this paper, a three-dimensional lattice model based on the Monte Carlo approach is presented. This model is developed to investigate the kinetics of morphology change during phase separation in nonstoichiometric Si oxide (SiOx, x < 2) films. The model takes into account the SiOx local atomic structure and probabilistic migration of oxygen atoms driven by the tendency of free energy minimization. The influence of the initial SiOx stoichiometry index x and film thickness on the morphology of the precipitated Si phase in the Si oxide matrix is analyzed. The morphology of the Si phase is shown to critically depend on the initial SiOx stoichiometry. Namely, isolated Si nanoparticles form at low excess Si content (x >= 1.4), while interconnected Si networks always appear at x <= 0.8. A dimensional effect on the morphology of the Si phase is revealed. Namely, reducing the film thickness imposes geometric constraints on the Si network formation. The percolation threshold is found to shift from xp ~= 1.35 for the bulk-like SiOx layers to xp ~= 0.85 for the quasi-two-dimensional films. The transition to the bulk material behavior is observed at a SiOx thickness of approximately 4.2 nm.

Title: Microscopic Theory of a Fluctuation-Induced Dynamical Crossover in Supercooled Liquids
Authors: Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen, Grzegorz Szamel
Abstract: Mean-field theories of the glass transition predict a phase transition to a dynamically arrested state, yet no such transition is observed in experiments or simulations of finite-dimensional systems. We resolve this long-standing discrepancy by incorporating critical dynamical fluctuations into a microscopic mode-coupling framework. We show that these fluctuations round off the mean-field singularity and restore ergodicity at all finite densities (or temperatures) without invoking activated dynamics or facilitation. The resulting effective theory describes the order parameter as a stochastic process with self-induced, annealed disorder, determined self-consistently at the mean-field level. In the $\beta$-relaxation regime it reduces to stochastic beta-relaxation theory, thereby unifying mode-coupling and replica-based approaches beyond mean-field. All parameters of the stochastic $\beta$-relaxation theory are fixed by the static structure, enabling parameter-free predictions that extend mean-field theory into finite dimensions.

Title: Theory of the $β$-Relaxation Beyond Mode-Coupling Theory: A Microscopic Treatment
Authors: Corentin C. L. Laudicina, Liesbeth M. C. Janssen, Grzegorz Szamel
Abstract: We develop a systematic extension of mode-coupling theory (MCT) that incorporates critical dynamical fluctuations. Starting from a microscopic diagrammatic theory, we identify dominant classes of divergent diagrams near the mode-coupling transition and show that the corresponding asymptotic series dominates the mean-field below an upper critical dimension $d_c=8$. To resum these divergences, we construct a mapping to a stochastic dynamical process in which the order parameter evolves under random spatiotemporal fields. This reformulation provides a controlled, fully dynamical derivation of an effective theory for the $\beta$-relaxation which remarkably coincides with stochastic beta-relaxation theory [T. Rizzo, EPL 106, 56003 (2014)]. All coupling constants of the latter theory are expressed microscopically in terms of the liquid static structure factor and are computed for the paradigmatic hard-sphere system. The analysis demonstrates that fluctuations alone restore ergodicity and replace the putative mean-field transition by a smooth crossover. Our results establish a predictive framework for structural relaxation beyond mean-field.

Title: Autoregressive Neural Network Extrapolation of Quantum Spin Dynamics Across Time and Space
Authors: Hubert Pugzlys, Shreyas Varude, Sam Dillon, Huy Tran, Ta Tang, Zhe Jiang, Xuzhe Ying, Chunjing Jia
Abstract: Understanding the dynamical response of quantum materials is central to revealing their microscopic properties, yet access to long-time and large-scale dynamics remains severely limited by rapidly growing computational costs and entanglement, particularly in gapless systems. Here we introduce an autoregressive machine-learning framework that enables the extrapolation of dynamical spin correlations in both time and space beyond the reach of conventional numerical methods. Trained on time-dependent density matrix renormalization group simulations of the gapless XXZ model, our approach is benchmarked against exact solutions available for this analytically solvable system. Combined with physics-informed spatial extension, multi-layer perceptron model using ReLU activation functions has been shown to be superior than convolutional neural networks and linear regressions for longer time extrapolation. Perturbation study of error accumulation further demonstrates that our autoregressive neural network extrapolations are highly robust to perturbations, suggesting stable and reliable predictions. This work establishes a new paradigm for studying the dynamics of gapless quantum many-body systems, in which machine learning extends and complements the capabilities of state-of-the-art numerical approaches.

Abstract: Understanding and predicting thermal transport in disordered materials remains a significant challenge due to the absence of periodicity and the complex nature of medium-range structural motifs. In this work, we investigate amorphous graphene and demonstrate that persistent homology, a topological data analysis technique, can serve as a physically interpretable structural descriptor for predicting thermal conductivity. We first show that ridge regression using persistent homology descriptors achieves high prediction accuracy. To gain physical insight into the prediction process, we perform inverse analysis by mapping the regression coefficients back onto the persistence diagrams. This reveals that distorted hexagonal and triangular motifs are strongly correlated with reduced thermal conductivity. A further comparison with the spatial distribution of localized vibrational modes supports the physical interpretation that these motifs suppress thermal transport. Our findings highlight that persistent homology not only enables accurate prediction of physical properties but also uncovers meaningful structure-property relationships in two-dimensional amorphous materials. This approach offers a promising framework for interpretable machine-learning models in materials science.

Title: Quantum-inspired Chemical Rule for Discovering Topological Materials
Authors: Xinyu Xu, Rajibul Islam, Ghulam Hussain, Yangming Huang, Xiaoguang Li, Pavlo O. Dral, Arif Ullah, Ming Yang
Abstract: Topological materials exhibit unique electronic structures that underpin both fundamental quantum phenomena and next-generation technologies, yet their discovery remains constrained by the high computational cost of first-principles calculations and the slow, resource-intensive nature of experimental synthesis. Recent machine-learning approaches, such as the heuristic topogivity rule, offer data-driven alternatives by quantifying each element's intrinsic tendency toward topological behavior. Here, we develop a quantum-classical hybrid artificial neural network (QANN) that extends this rule into a quantum-inspired formulation. Within this framework, the QANN maps compositional descriptors to quantum probability amplitudes, naturally introducing pairwise inter-element correlations inaccessible to classical heuristics. The physical validity of these correlations is substantiated by constructing an equivalent complex-valued neural network (CVNN), confirming both the consistency and interpretability of the formulation. Retaining the simplicity of chemical reasoning while embedding quantum-native features, our quantum-inspired rule enables efficient and generalizable topological classification. High-throughput screening combined with first-principles (DFT) validation reveals five previously unreported topological compounds, demonstrating the enhanced predictive power and physical insight afforded by quantum-inspired heuristics.

Title: Vertex Model Mechanics Explain the Emergence of Centroidal Voronoi Tiling in Epithelia
Authors: Sulaimaan Lim, Julien Vermot, Chiu Fan Lee
Abstract: Epithelia are confluent cell layers that self-organize into polygonal networks whose geometry encodes their mechanical state. A principal driver is the tunable contractility of the actomyosin cortex, which links cell-junction tension to tissue architecture. Notably, epithelial tilings frequently resemble centroidal Voronoi tessellations (CVTs), yet the physical origin of this resemblance has remained unclear. Here, using a minimal vertex model that relates cell shape to a mechanical energy, we show that CVT-like patterns arise naturally in the solid (rigid) regime of tissues. Analytical theory reveals that isotropic strain minimization drives cell centroids toward Voronoi configurations, a result we corroborate with a analytical mean-field formulation of the vertex model. We further demonstrate that physiologically relevant perturbations -- such as cyclic stretch -- shift tissues into distinct, geometrically disordered CVT states, and that these shifts provide quantitative, image-based readouts of mechanical state. Together, our results identify a mechanical origin for CVT-like organization in epithelia and establish a geometric framework that infers tissue stresses directly from morphology, offering broadly applicable metrics for assessing rigidity and remodeling in living tissues.

Title: Hydrothermal synthesis of SnO2 particles for the degradation of Methylene Blue (MB) dye in presence of sunlight
Authors: Komal Singh, Jyoti Sindkar, Mrunal Ramdasi, Vrishali Jadhav, Rohidas B. Kale
Abstract: Three distinct samples were proceed through synthesis utilizing the hydrothermal method to develop tin dioxide (SnO2) nanoparticles. Consistency in all other parameters was ensured by maintaining a constant temperature and time throughout the synthesis. X-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) were used to examine how the surfactant affected the structural, morphological, and crystallographic characteristics. A tetragonal rutile SnO2 phase was confirmed to have formed by XRD investigation, with high crystallinity indicated by strong diffraction peaks. Higher precursor concentration samples showed aggregation, indicating that the smaller size of the nanoparticles caused them to interact. These findings show that changing the surfactant has a major impact on the crystallinity, size, and shape of SnO2 nanoparticles, which makes this technique establish for certain uses, including energy storage, gas sensors, and photocatalysis. Additionally, we examined the photocatalytic activity of the aforementioned samples, indicating from the UV-vis characterization results that the sample containing PEG as a surfactant performs better than others.

Title: Quantum Hall effect in lightly hydrogenated graphene
Authors: I. G. van Rens, O. O. Zheliuk, M. W. de Dreu, K. Mukhuti, Y. Kreminska, C. S. A. Müller, P. C. M. Christianen, J. T. Ye, N. de Groot, U. Zeitler
Abstract: We have measured the quantum Hall effect in monolayer graphene samples that were exposed to a cold hydrogen plasma leading to a hydrogenation level of a few percent. Compared to pristine graphene, the Landau level distance significantly decreases in the hydrogenated structures, and its field dependence changes from square root type to linear. From this observation we conclude that the band structure in hydrogenated graphene changes from a linear Dirac-Weyl type dispersion to a quadratic one with an effective electron mass $m_e^* = 0.24~m_e$. This is in good agreement with ab-initio band structure calculations of hydrogen decorated graphene monolayer.

Title: Computational tuning of the elastic properties of low- and high-entropy ultra-high temperature ceramics
Authors: Samuel J. Magorrian, Ljiljana Stojanović, Lara Kabalan, Ardita Shkurti, Richard N. White, Fabian L. Thiemann, Viktor Zólyomi
Abstract: Ultra-high temperature ceramics (UHTCs) represent a class of crystalline materials for extreme environments. They can withstand extremely high temperatures but are mechanically difficult to work with due to their inherent brittleness. Mixture compounds, in particular high-entropy mixtures, offer a pathway to tune the physical properties of UHTCs such as their elastic constants. Here we fine-tune the MACE-MPA-0 universal machine-learning potential on rocksalt carbide UHTCs containing group IV-V metals and demonstrate that not only do the elastic constants deviate from the rule of mixtures approximation in the high-entropy limit, but also in the low-entropy limit of binary and ternary mixtures. We find that this is caused by distortion imposed by the lattice mismatch, enabling the tuning of the physical properties of UHTC mixtures in both low- and high-entropy compounds. We identify a three-component mixture compound, HfCVCZrC, as the best balance between synthesizability and toughness, and apply our developed MACE-UHTC model to identify a range of non-equimolar candidate compositions of this compound which may enable the synthesis of a mixture UHTC with a Young's modulus up to 40 GPa below that of ZrC.

Title: Scaling laws for stationary Navier-Stokes-Fourier flows and the unreasonable effectiveness of hydrodynamics at the molecular level
Authors: P.I. Hurtado, J.J. del Pozo, P.L. Garrido
Abstract: Hydrodynamics provides a universal description of the emergent collective dynamics of vastly different many-body systems, based solely on their symmetries and conservation laws. Here we harness this universality, encoded in the Navier-Stokes-Fourier (NSF) equations, to find general scaling laws for the stationary uniaxial solutions of the compressible NSF problem far from equilibrium. We show for general transport coefficients that the steady density and temperature fields are functions of the pressure and a kinetic field that quantifies the quadratic excess velocity relative to the ratio of heat flux and shear stress. This kinetic field obeys in turn a spatial scaling law controlled by pressure and stress, which is inherited by the stationary density and temperature fields. We develop a scaling approach to measure the associated master curves, and confirm our predictions through compelling data collapses in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations of paradigmatic model fluids. Interestingly, the robustness of the scaling laws in the face of significant finite-size effects reveals the surprising accuracy of NSF equations in describing molecular-scale stationary flows. Overall, these scaling laws provide a novel characterization of stationary states in driven fluids.

Title: Inferring intraciliary dynamics from the gliding motility of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Authors: Nicolas Fares (1), Elorri Garcia (1), Ahmad Badr (1), Yacine Amarouchene (1), Alexandros A Fragkopoulos, Oliver Bäumchen, Thomas Salez (1), Antoine Allard (1) ((1) LOMA)
Abstract: The unicellular microalga Chlamydomonas reinhardtii is widely recognized as a premier model living microswimmer for physicists and biophysicists. However, the interest around C. reinhardtii goes beyond its swimming capabilities. In fact, light can drastically alter its behavior: under blue illumination, the cell attaches to a nearby surface and intermittently glides on it. Such a gliding motility is powered by molecular-motor proteins operating on the cell's cilia, and the related machinery has established the cell as a prime reference for the study of intraciliary-transport mechanisms. This is what we focus on in the present work, by combining in-line holographic microscopy -which leads to unprecedented spatial and temporal resolutions on the gliding dynamics -and statistical inference. We show that, while gliding, the cells exhibit anomalous-diffusive features, including Lorentzian-like distributions of displacements, which are reminiscent of enhanced search strategies. The latter may be exploited by the cells to facilitate colony formation, or, more broadly, by organisms possessing an intraciliary-transport machinery for the transport of cargo molecules and signaling. Furthermore, gliding trajectories, by being intermittent, are valid candidates to infer forces at the molecular-motor scale that are necessary for the cells to move, or symetrically, to transport cargo molecules. We report a gliding threshold of about 20 pN, compatible with the activity of single molecular motors.

Title: Self-assembled filament layers in drying sessile droplets: from morphology to electrical conductivity
Authors: Johannes Schöttner, Qingguang Xie, Gaurav Nath, Jens Harting
Abstract: Controlling the deposition of filaments, such as nanowires and nanotubes, from evaporating droplets is critical for the performance of emerging technologies like flexible sensors and printed electronics. The final deposit morphology strongly governs functional properties, such as electrical conductivity, yet remains challenging to control. In this work, we numerically investigate how filament length, stiffness, and concentration affect deposition patterns during the drying process. We compare reaction-limited and diffusion-limited evaporation regimes, demonstrating that their distinct velocity fields and flow magnitudes fundamentally alter filament arrangement. While diffusion-limited evaporation drives the ``coffee-ring effect", compromising network uniformity, reaction-limited evaporation suppresses edge accumulation, promoting centered conductive deposits. We map out the spatial variation of filament alignment - tangential at the contact line, radial in the intermediate region, and random near the center. Longer filaments tend to favour more tangential alignment overall and suppress edge accumulation. We find that by tuning the evaporation regime, filament deposition can lead to significantly lower percolation thresholds and significantly higher conductivity exponents. These results quantify the link between evaporation kinetics and microstructure, providing guidelines for optimizing conductive network formation in printed electronics.

Title: Zipfian universality of interaction laws: A statistical-mechanics framework for inverse power scaling
Authors: Jerome Baray
Abstract: Inverse power-law interaction forms, such as the inverse-square law, recur across a wide range of physical, social, and spatial systems. While traditionally derived from specific microscopic mechanisms, the ubiquity of these laws suggests a more general organizing principle. This article proposes a statistical-mechanics framework in which such interaction laws emerge as macroscopic fixed points of aggregation processes involving strongly heterogeneous microscopic contributions. We consider systems where individual interaction sources exhibit heavy-tailed heterogeneity consistent with Zipf-Pareto statistics and where aggregation proceeds without intrinsic length scales. Under minimal assumptions of heterogeneity, multiplicativity, scale invariance, and stability under coarse-graining, we show that the resulting macroscopic interaction field must adopt a scale-free, power-law form. The associated exponent is not imposed a priori but emerges from effective dimensionality, symmetry, and aggregation structure. Within this framework, the inverse-square law is interpreted as a stable statistical fixed point corresponding to isotropic aggregation in an effective three-dimensional space, while deviations from this regime naturally arise from anisotropy, constrained geometries, or nontrivial effective dimensions. This perspective provides a unified interpretation of interaction laws observed in physics, spatial economics, and human geography, without invoking domain-specific microscopic mechanisms. The proposed framework reframes inverse power-law interactions as robust emergent features of Zipfian aggregation rather than as unique consequences of particular physical forces, thereby offering a common statistical explanation for their cross-disciplinary recurrence.

Title: Probing ground-state degeneracies of a strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard model with superconducting correlations
Authors: Sebastiaan L. D. ten Haaf, Sebastian Miles, Qingzhen Wang, A. Mert Bozkurt, Ivan Kulesh, Yining Zhang, Christian G. Prosko, Michael Wimmer, Srijit Goswami
Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model and its rich phase diagram naturally emerges as a description for a wide range of electronic systems. Recent advances in semiconductor-superconductor hybrid quantum dot arrays have allowed to realize degenerate quantum systems in a controllable way, e.g., allowing to observe robust zero-bias peaks in Kitaev chains, indicative for Majorana bound states. In this work, we connect these two domains. Noting the strong on-site Coulomb repulsion within quantum dots, we study small arrays of spinful hybrid quantum dots implemented in a two-dimensional electron gas. This system constitutes a Fermi-Hubbard model with inter-site superconducting correlations. For two electronic sites, we find robust zero-bias peaks indicative of a strongly degenerate spectrum hosting emergent Majorana Kramers pairs or $\mathbb{Z}_3$-parafermions. Extending to three sites, we find that these spinful systems scale very differently compared to spinless Kitaev chains. When the sweet-spot conditions are satisfied pairwise, we find that the ground state degeneracy of the full three-site system is lifted. This degeneracy can be restored by tuning the superconducting phase difference between the hybrid segments. However, these states are not robust to quantum dot detuning. Our observations are a first step towards studying degeneracies in strongly interacting Fermi-Hubbard systems with superconducting correlations.

Title: Giant hysteretic magnetoresistance accompanying the Mott transition and spin-glass state in organic metal
Authors: P.D. Grigoriev, S.I. Pesotskii, R.B. Lyubovskii, S.A. Torunova, D.S. Lyubshin, V.N. Zverev
Abstract: The giant magnetoresistance with a huge hysteresis is observed in the organic metal k-(BEDTTTF)2Hg(SCN)2Br at low temperature in a pressure interval around 3 kbar of a width ~1 kbar. The hysteretic magnetoresistance is isotropic with respect to the direction of magnetic field, which excludes the orbital effect of magnetic field as its origin. The observed temperature and magnetic-field dependence of this hysteresis and of its relaxation time indicates the strong influence of spin-glass state on magnetoresistance. Although a quantitative theory of this effect, originating from strong electronic correlations, requires complex numerical calculations, we suggest its explanation and a simple model which qualitatively describes the observed magnetoresistance behavior and shows a strong charge-spin entanglement. The proposed effect suggests a new class of extreme magnetoresistance mechanisms.

Abstract: Reproducibility and quantization in quantum spin Hall platforms is a persisting challenge, limiting their use in hybrid realizations of topological superconductivity. We report robust and reproducible quantized transport in a graphene quantum Hall topological insulator, stabilized at low magnetic fields by screening long-range Coulomb interactions with a metallic Bi$_2$Se$_3$ back gate. Beyond quantized resistance plateaus, we demonstrate mode-resolved control via gate-defined chiral-helical junctions that selectively transmit or backscatter a single helical channel, a capability inaccessible in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall systems. Targeted experiments and simulations identify contact-induced doping, effectively creating unintended chiral-helical interfaces, as a generic mechanism for quantization breakdown, which is mitigated by large area contacts that enhance edge-channel equilibration. Our findings establish metal screened graphene as a gate-tunable, interaction-driven helical system with quantized transport, spatially separable helical channels, and compatibility with superconducting proximity for topological devices.

Title: Observation of a supersolid stripe state in two-dimensional dipolar gases
Authors: Yifei He, Haoting Zhen, Mithilesh K. Parit, Mingchen Huang, Nicolò Defenu, Jordi Boronat, Juan Sánchez-Baena, Gyu-Boong Jo
Abstract: Fluctuations typically destroy long-range order in two-dimensional (2D) systems, posing a fundamental challenge to the existence of exotic states like supersolids, which paradoxically combine solid-like structure with frictionless superfluid flow. While long-predicted, the definitive observation of a 2D supersolid has remained an outstanding experimental goal. Here, we report the observation of a supersolid stripe phase in a strongly dipolar quantum gas of erbium atoms confined to 2D. We directly image the periodic density modulation, confirming its global phase coherence through matter-wave interference and demonstrating its phase rigidity relevant to the low-energy Goldstone mode, consistent with numerical calculations. Through collective excitation measurements, we demonstrate the hydrodynamic behavior of the supersolid. This work highlights a novel mechanism for supersolid formation in low dimensions, and opens the door for future research on the intricate interplay between temperature, supersolidity, and dimensionality.

Abstract: Low-dimensional metal halide perovskites provide exciting opportunities to fabricate new semiconductor materials. Semiconductor technology relies on electronic heterojunctions, and cost-efficient and flexible approaches to realize functional heterostructures are of fundamental importance. Lateral heterostructures define the energy landscape in the plane of the semiconducting lattice in such 2D materials, representing an ideal platform to tailor energy barriers and to control charge carrier flow. Here, we demonstrate a versatile one-pot synthesis to fabricate a large variety of 2D perovskite heterostructures based on different halides and/or metal cations. Exploiting sequential crystallization of different 2D perovskites, and playing with the composition and injection events of the materials, enables the design of diverse heterostructure architectures including multiple heterojunctions. We obtain crystalline quality of the heterojunctions, multicolor emission, and optical coupling between the different heterostructure regions. We foresee that the design freedom of our method will stimulate the development of novel optoelectronic devices where electronic band engineering is crucial.

Title: Spectral Entropy via Random Spanning Forests
Authors: Carlo Nicolini
Abstract: We establish an exact analytic relation between random spanning forests and the heat-kernel partition function. This identity enables estimation of partition functions, energies, and the Von Neumann entropy by Wilson sampling of forests, avoiding costly Laplacian eigendecompositions. We validate inverse-Laplace reconstructions stabilized by a Stieltjes spectral-density regularization on synthetic networks. The approach is scalable and yields local node and edge thermodynamic descriptors.

Title: Chirality Imprinting and Spin-texture Tunability in Conformally Coated 3D Magnetic Nanostructured Metamaterials
Authors: Alexander Roberts, Huixin Guo, Joseph Askey, Vani Lanka, Arjen van den Berg, Dirk Grundler, Sam Ladak
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer unprecedented opportunities for engineering emergent spin textures, but controlling their configuration remains a central challenge. Here we show that conformally coated Ni Nanotubes arranged in a woodpile geometry with lattice spacings ranging from 800 to 1200 nm, realised by two-photon lithography and atomic layer deposition, exhibit a geometry-tuneable balance between chiral and axial states. Magnetic force microscopy on the top layer of the 3D woodpile reveals that few-layer systems exhibit a chiral contrast whilst increasing the number of stacked layers drives a transition to an axial configuration with the change in state populations depending strongly on lattice spacing. Micromagnetic simulations demonstrate that chirality is not intrinsic to isolated tubes but is imprinted by spin textures formed in the substrate sheet film, which couple into the 3D network. As the sheet-film influence diminishes with increasing layer number, dipolar interactions dominate and stabilise the axial state. This two-stage mechanism of chirality imprinting followed by increasingly dominant dipolar interactions, provides clear control parameters for tailoring spin-texture populations. Our results establish conformally coated woodpiles as a reconfigurable 3D ferromagnetic metamaterial platform that can be exploited for data storage, magnonics, and neuromorphic computing.

Title: Scaling Laws and Universal Features of Tethered Polymer Distributions in Confined Geometries
Authors: Bibhatsu Kuiri, Rittwick Mondal, Dipankar Biswas, Soumyajyoti Kabi
Abstract: We develop a unified scaling framework for the end-position distributions of tethered polymers confined in finite cylindrical geometries. Two observables are analysed: the longitudinal distribution P(x), along the confinement axis, and the transverse distribution P(y), perpendicular to the confinement axis. Using exact Fourier-sine and image-method representations with adaptive numerical schemes, we construct and test six scaling strategies for P(x) and five for P(y), encompassing geometric similarity, tether-position sweeps, confinement-strength crossovers, persistence-length effects, boundary-layer scaling near absorbing walls, and tether-centered coil scaling. Quantitative collapse diagnostics such as RMS residuals on common support, modal-energy fractions, and survival probabilities are combined with limiting-regime analysis and direct numerical evaluation to distinguish genuine universality from visually misleading overlap. From these tests we obtain a kappa-based confinement diagram and a two-parameter (kappa, a/L) regime map that link classical theories such as Flory/de Gennes blobs, Odijk deflection segments, and wormlike-chain behaviour within a single spectral picture. Gaussian, multimode, and eigenmode-dominated regimes are identified by explicit thresholds in modal composition and collapse error, providing operational criteria for when Gaussian or single-mode descriptions are valid and when full multimode structure is required. The resulting framework provides a compact, reproducible toolkit for analysing confined-polymer statistics, with applications to simulations and experiments on DNA, chromatin, and other biopolymers where confinement, stiffness, and tethering jointly control spatial organization.

Title: Eigenstate Typicality as the Dynamical Bridge to the Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis: A Derivation from Entropy, Geometry, and Locality
Authors: Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) provides a powerful framework for understanding thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems, yet its physical foundations and minimal underlying assumptions remain actively debated. In this work, we develop a unified framework that clarifies the origin of ETH by separating kinematic typicality from dynamical input. We show that the characteristic ETH structure of local operator matrix elements follows from four ingredients: the maximum entropy principle, the geometry of high-dimensional Hilbert space, the locality of physical observables, and a minimal dynamical principle, which we term the eigenstate typicality principle (ETP). ETP asserts that in quantum-chaotic systems, energy eigenstates are statistically indistinguishable from typical states within a narrow microcanonical shell with respect to local measurements. Within this framework, diagonal ETH emerges from measure concentration, while the universal exponential suppression and smooth energy-frequency dependence of off-diagonal matrix elements arise from entropic scaling and local dynamical correlations, without invoking random-matrix assumptions. Our results establish ETH as a consequence of entropy, geometry, and chaos-induced typicality, and clarify its scope, thereby deepening our understanding of quantum thermalization and the emergence of statistical mechanics from unitary many-body dynamics.

Title: Theoretical investigation of patterned two-dimensional semiconductors for tailored light--matter interactions
Authors: Christian Nicolaisen Hansen, Line Jelver, Christos Tserkezis
Abstract: We introduce theoretical methods for describing the optical response of two-dimensional (2D) materials patterned at the nanoscale into both arrays of ribbons along a planar surface and spherical particles. Fourier-Floquet decompositions of the electromagnetic fields are used in order to obtain the reflectance, transmittance and absorbance of the nanoribbon array. The spherical particles consist of a vacuum or dielectric core, coated by single 2D material layers. A Mie theory, with boundary conditions modified to accommodate a 2D material at the interface, is applied to theoretically examine these spherical particles. As examples of 2D materials, we consider the excitonic response of hexagonal boron nitride in the ultraviolet, and of the transition-metal dichalcogenide WS2 in the visible. The most important steps and equations for implementing the various methods are provided as a means to an easy introduction to the theory of patterned 2D materials. This renders the article a toolset for investigating the patterning of any 2D material with the intention to tune their optical response and/or introduce hybridization schemes with their excitons. The methods are not restricted to exciton polaritons in 2D semiconductors, but can be applied, by simple replacement of the optical conductivity, to 2D materials exhibiting any polaritonic response.

Title: Diffusiophoretic migration of colloidal particles in sucrose gradients
Authors: Antoine Monier, Brielle Byerley, Julien Renaudeau, H. Daniel Ou-Yang, Pierre Lidon, Jean-Baptiste Salmon
Abstract: Diffusiophoresis (DP) refers to the migration of particles driven by a solute concentration gradient in a liquid. Observations in the case of molecular neutral solutes are rather scarce, due to the low drift velocities in dilute solutions, and the difficulty in distinguishing DP from other phenomena in concentrated solutions. We investigated experimentally DP of dispersed colloids driven by concentration gradients of sucrose in water at relatively high concentrations, $C \simeq 1$ mol L$^{-1}$. More precisely, we designed a microfluidic chip to impose a time-dependent sucrose gradient in dead-end microchannels with minimized parasitic flows. Significant migration of the particles toward the regions of low sucrose concentration has been observed, with velocities up to a few $\mu$m s$^{-1}$. Particle tracking and Raman confocal spectroscopy were used to measure individual trajectories and the unsteady sucrose concentration profile respectively. The latter is correctly described by a diffusion equation, but with an interdiffusion coefficient that significantly depends on $C$ in the range of concentrations investigated. We then showed that a model of DP based on a steric exclusion of sucrose molecules from the particle surface with an exclusion length $R_i = 5 \pm 0.9$ angstrom (close to the characteristic size of the sucrose molecule), accounts for the observed trajectories. Possible sources for the observed scattering of our experimental data are finally discussed: Brownian motion and advection of the particles by bulk flows driven by diffusioosmosis at the channel walls and buoyancy.

Title: Transport of Dirac magnons driven by gauge fields
Authors: Luis Fernández, Ka Shen, Leandro O. Nascimento, Van Sérgio Alves, Roberto E. Troncoso, Nicolas Vidal-Silva
Abstract: We present a unified quantum field theory for Dirac magnons coupled to emergent gauge fields. At zero temperature, any space- and time-dependent gauge perturbation drives magnons out of equilibrium, generating spin currents and magnon accumulation without conventional thermal or chemical potential gradients. For a honeycomb ferromagnet, we derive closed-form expressions for the induced density and current. In the DC limit, the transverse spin conductivity quantizes to $\sigma^{xy}=\alpha^2\text{sgn}(m)\hbar/4\pi$, a magnonic analog of the quantum Hall effect, where $m$ is the topological magnon mass and $\alpha$ a dimensionless coupling constant. In the AC regime, the conductivity exhibits a sharp resonance when the drive frequency matches the topological gap $\Delta$, signaling interband transitions. Our work establishes gauge fields as a versatile tool for controlling magnon transport and reveals topologically protected quantized responses.

Title: Developing a valence force field model for wurtzite semiconductors by exploiting similarities with [111]-oriented zinc blende systems: The case of wurtzite boron nitride, III-N materials and (B,In,Ga)N alloys
Authors: Aisling Power, Cara-Lena Nies, Stefan Schulz
Abstract: Controlling the crystal phase and lattice mismatch of semiconductors offers a powerful route to engineer electronic and optical properties of heterostructures. As a consequence, semiconductors in the wurtzite phase are increasingly sought after, superseding the thermodynamically favored cubic zinc blende phase. Empirical atomistic modeling, required for large scale simulations of heterostructures and their properties, relies heavily on valence force field (VFF) methods to find the equilibrium atomic positions in an alloy. For zinc blende crystals, VFF models are well-established. In the case of wurtzite, such parameters are frequently adopted without rigorous analysis, despite subtle but consequential differences from the zinc blende structure. Such an approach can compromise accuracy in describing material properties, since the structural differences between zinc blende and wurtzite directly influence electronic and optical characteristics. Based on the analytical VFF model by Tanner et al., and using structural similarities between wurtzite and [111]-oriented zinc blende, we construct a wurtzite VFF without introducing additional parameters. Our framework relies on analytic expressions and minimization routines to project zinc blende models onto wurtzite systems. Beyond elastic tensors, we train the model to reproduce bond length asymmetries and band gaps by using output of the VFF model in density functional theory calculations. Applied to wurtzite III-N compounds and BN, the model accurately reproduces targeted observables but also properties it has not been trained on, including the internal parameter u. We further validate the model on highly mismatched alloys such as (B,Ga)N and (B,In,Ga)N, exhibiting good agreement between VFF and density functional theory results when using identical supercells in these calculations.

Title: Control of thin NbN film superconducting properties by ScN buffer layer
Authors: N.V. Porokhov, M.A. Dryazgov, A.R. Shevchenko, A.M. Mumlyakov, Z.S. Enbaev, Yu.V. Blinova, D.I. Devyaterikov, Yu.P. Korneeva, A.A. Korneev, M. A. Tarkhov
Abstract: This work investigates the effect of a scandium nitride buffer layer on the superconducting properties of niobium nitride thin films. The use of a ScN buffer layer significantly improves the characteristics of 29 nm thick NbN films: the critical temperature Tc increases from 9 K to 12.5 K, while the resistivity at 20 K decreases from 330 mkOhm*cm to 210 mkOhm*cm compared to films without a buffer layer. These enhancements are attributed to the better lattice matching between NbN and ScN, which results in a higher quality crystal lattice of the NbN film, as confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and X-ray diffraction data.

Abstract: Low-dimensional magnetic systems based on honeycomb lattices provide a promising platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena that emerge from the intricate interplay of competing spin, orbital, lattice, and dipolar degrees of freedom. Here, we present a comprehensive study of the layered honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet BiCrTeO$_6$ using magnetization, specific heat, muon spin--relaxation ($\mu$SR) spectroscopy, dielectric, pyrocurrent, and high-resolution synchrotron X-ray diffraction (SXRD) measurements. Our results reveal an array of intriguing and strongly correlated phenomena, including two successive antiferromagnetic transitions at $T_{\rm N1}\approx16$ K and $T_{\rm N2}\approx11$ K, a pronounced magnetodielectric coupling effect, and ferroelectric order at $T_{\rm N2}$. Consequently, this compound emerges as a new spin-driven multiferroic system. The SXRD analysis reveals a magnetoelastic-coupling-induced structural phase transition at $T_{\rm N2}$, characterized by a symmetry lowering from P$\bar{3}$1c (163) to P31c (159), which likely triggers the onset of ferroelectricity. In addition to its low-temperature multiferroic behavior, the system exhibits dielectric relaxor characteristics at higher temperatures within the paramagnetic region ($T<50$ K), which is intrinsically linked to the antisite disorder of Cr and Te atoms.

Title: Probing Pair Density Waves with Twisted Josephson Junctions
Authors: Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: We show that twisted interfaces between superconductors can serve as a phase-sensitive platform for the detection and characterization of pair density waves (PDW). In the presence of an in-plane magnetic field, the critical Josephson current of a twisted PDW interface is maximal at a finite field value, determined by the twist angle and the PDW period - an explicit signature of the PDW. The results are robust to variations in junction geometry and can be adapted to certain cases with strong disorder or fluctuations. Their temperature dependence allows to distinguish pure PDW from byproducts of coexistence of superconductivity and charge- or spin- density waves.

Title: Gate-Tunable Giant Negative Magnetoresistance in Tellurene Driven by Quantum Geometry
Authors: Marcello B. Silva Neto, Chang Niu, Marcus V. O. Moutinho, Pierpaolo Fontana, Claudio Iacovelli, Victor Velasco, Caio Lewenkopf, Peide D. Ye
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in conventional two-dimensional electron gases is a well-known phenomenon, but its origin in complex and topological materials, especially those endowed with quantum geometry, remains largely elusive. Here, we report the discovery of a giant negative magnetoresistance, reaching a remarkable $- 90\%$ of the resistance at zero magnetic field, $R_0$, in $n$-type tellurene films. This record-breaking effect persists over a wide magnetic field range (measured up to $35$ T) at cryogenic temperatures and is suppressed when the chemical potential shifts away from the Weyl node in the conduction band, strongly suggesting a quantum geometric origin. We propose two novel mechanisms for this phenomenon: a quantum geometric enhancement of diffusion and a magnetoelectric spin interaction that locks the spin of a Weyl fermion, in cyclotron motion under crossed electric $\boldsymbol{\cal E}$ and magnetic ${\bf B}$ fields, to its guiding-center drift, $(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})\cdot\sigma$. We show that the time integral of the velocity auto-correlations promoted by the quantum metric between the spin-split conduction bands enhance diffusion, thereby reducing the resistance. This mechanism is experimentally confirmed by its unique magnetoelectric dependence, $\Delta R_{zz}(\boldsymbol{\cal E},{\bf B})/R_0=-\beta_{g}(\boldsymbol{\cal E}\times{\bf B})^2$, with $\beta_{g}$ determined by the quantum metric. Our findings establish a new, quantum geometric and non-Markovian memory effect in magnetotransport, paving the way for controlling electronic transport in complex and topological matter.

Title: Large Deviation Properties of Minimum Spanning Trees for Random Graphs
Authors: Mahdi Sarikhani, Alexander K. Hartmann
Abstract: We study the large-deviation properties of minimum spanning trees for two ensembles of random graphs with $N$ nodes. First, we consider complete graphs. Second, we study Erdős-Rényi (ER) random graphs with edge probability $p=c/N$ conditioned to be connected. By using large-deviation Markov chain sampling, we are able to obtain the distribution $P(W)$ of the spanning-tree weight $W$ down to probability densities as small as $10^{-300}$. For the complete graph, we confirm analytical predictions with respect to the expectation value. For both ensembles, the large deviation principle is fulfilled. For the connected ER graphs, we observe a remarkable change of the distributions at the value of $c=1$, which is the percolation threshold for the original ER ensemble.

Title: Towards Animate Droplets: Active, Adaptive, and Autonomous
Authors: Joe Forth, Robert Malinowski, Giorgio Volpe
Abstract: Droplets, sub-millilitre liquid volumes with at least one interface, have traditionally served as compartments for storing, transporting, and delivering materials. Beyond familiar applications in food, coatings, and consumer goods, they find cutting-edge use in energy storage, sensing, and tissue engineering. The next frontier is their integration into animate matter, emerging materials defined by their levels of activity, adaptiveness, and autonomy. Easy to produce and dispense or print into complex structures, and with enormous chemical versatility, droplets are ideal building blocks for animate matter. In this Perspective, we outline a roadmap for advancing animacy in droplets and call for a more concerted effort to integrate novel mechanisms for motility, sensing, and decision-making into droplet design. Although research on active droplets spans more than a century, achieving true autonomy, where droplets process multiple stimuli and respond without external control, remains a central challenge. We hope to inspire interdisciplinary collaboration towards applications in consumer goods, microfluidics, adaptive optics, tissue engineering, and soft robotics.

Title: Computational discovery of ferromagnetic AT6X6 kagome compounds
Authors: Shiya Chen, Zhen Zhang, Vladimir Antropov, Yang Sun
Abstract: We present a systematic high-throughput density-functional-theory investigation of the structural and magnetic stability of 312 substitutional compounds in the magnetic kagome AT6X6 family. Our screening confirms the stability of many previously reported structures and predicts several additional stable candidates. Within collinear spin configurations, we find that Fe-based systems predominantly adopt antiferromagnetic ground states, whereas Mn-based analogues exhibit a more balanced distribution between ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic order. For compounds exhibiting several nearly degenerate collinear configurations, we analyze the nature of their magnetic ground states, assess the possible emergence of non-collinear order, and discuss the limitations and uncertainties inherent to standard density-functional approaches. Our electronic-structure analysis further reveals that newly predicted ferromagnetic kagome systems display characteristic features of topological metals, with rich magnetic configurations that can be tuned by chemical substitution. Overall, these ferromagnetic kagome compounds constitute a broad and still largely unexplored materials platform for the emergence of exciting magneto-transport phenomena.

Title: Linear magnetoresistance of two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit
Authors: Xiao-Bin Qiang, Han-Yi Xu, Ren-Jie Tong, Shuai Li, Zi-Xuan Gao, Peng-Lu Zhao, Hai-Zhou Lu
Abstract: Linear magnetoresistance is a hallmark of 3D Weyl metals in the quantum limit. Recently, a pronounced linear magnetoresistance has also been observed in 2D graphene [Xin et al., Nature 616, 270 (2023)]. However, a comprehensive theoretical understanding remains elusive. By employing the self-consistent Born approximation, we derive the analytical expressions for the magnetoresistivity of 2D massless Dirac fermions in the quantum limit. Notably, our result recovers the minimum conductivity in the clean limit and reveals a linear dependence of resistivity on the magnetic field for Gaussian impurity potentials, in quantitative agreement with experiments. These findings shed light on the magnetoresistance behavior of 2D Dirac fermions under ultra-high magnetic fields.

Title: Generation of chirality and orbital magnetization by Stone-Wales-type lattice defects in the Kitaev spin liquid
Authors: Arnab Seth, Fay Borhani, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: In this work we extend our study of the effect of certain crystallographic defects on the spin-1/2 Kitaev honeycomb spin liquid (arXiv:2511.19409), focusing on its gapless phase and contrasting with the gapped phase. We identify a Stone-Wales (SW) local defect consisting of a 90$^\circ$ bond rotation that preserves Kitaev bond labels for edge-sharing octahedra and thereby enables exact solvability. These SW-type defects involve odd-sided plaquettes with $\pm \pi/2$ fluxes, but can be created locally. An isolated defect hosts a time-reversal pair of ground-state flux configurations with large net chirality. Certain excitations are also chiral. The chirality manifests in Majorana local Chern marker and in scalar spin chirality, producing electronic orbital magnetization. T-matrix analysis and numerics at finite defect density $n_d$ show that defect chiralities generate a topological gap of $11 n_d$ protecting a Chern number $C=\pm 1$. Emergent ferromagnetic long range Ising interactions $r^{-\gamma}$ with $2<\gamma < 3$ between defect chiralities lead to a finite temperature $T_c$ phase transition into the chiral spin liquid. The $T_c$ is proportional to $n_d$ and diverges when $\gamma\rightarrow 2$. We also consider additional solvable impurity potentials and find that $\gamma$ can be reduced to below $2.3$ and correspondingly enhance $T_c$. Our results offer applications to 2D Dirac cone systems with a finite density of fluctuating Ising magnetic impurities and to identifying spin liquids with lattice defects.

Title: Impact of an electron Wigner crystal on exciton propagation
Authors: Daniel Erkensten, Alexey Chernikov, Ermin Malic
Abstract: The strong Coulomb interaction in 2D materials facilitates the formation of tightly bound excitons and charge-ordered phases of matter. A prominent example is the formation of a crystalline phase from free charges due to mutual Coulomb repulsion, known as the Wigner crystal. While exciton- electron interactions have been used as a sensor for Wigner crystallization, its impact on exciton properties has been poorly understood so far. Here, we show that the weak potential induced by periodically ordered Wigner crystal electrons has a major impact on exciton propagation, albeit having only a minor influence on exciton energy. The effect is tunable with carrier density determining the Wigner crystal confinement and temperature via thermal occupation of higher subbands. Our work provides microscopic insights into the interplay between excitons and charge-ordered states identifying key signatures in exciton transport, and establishes a theoretical framework for understanding exciton propagation in the presence of strong electronic correlations.

Title: Kovacs-like memory effect in strain stiffening collagen networks
Authors: Abhishek Ghadai, Sayantan Majumdar
Abstract: Materials driven far from equilibrium can encode memories of past deformations through long-lived structural reorganisations. Such memory effects-reflecting parameters such as deformation direction, magnitude, and duration have been widely explored in soft amorphous solids. Here, we report a Kovacs-like memory effect manifested as a non-monotonic stress relaxation in vitro biopolymer networks formed by collagen, an essential component of the mammalian extracellular matrix. Using shear rheology combined with in-situ optical imaging, we find that this memory effect emerges exclusively in the nonlinear strain-stiffening regime, and persists over a much broader range of strain amplitudes than previously reported for other viscoelastic amorphous materials. Furthermore, we uncover a strong correlation between the memory response and the development of negative normal stresses and associated strain fields, highlighting the unique nonequilibrium mechanics underlying memory formation in biopolymer networks.

Title: Optically trapped Feshbach molecules of fermionic $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K: Role of light-induced and collisional losses
Authors: Alberto Canali, Chun-Kit Wong, Luc Absil, Zhu-Xiong Ye, Marian Kreyer, Emil Kirilov, Rudolf Grimm
Abstract: We study the decay of a dense, ultracold sample of weakly bound DyK dimers stored in an optical dipole trap. Our bosonic dimers are composed of the fermionic isotopes $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K, which is of particular interest for experiments related to pairing and superfluidity in fermionic systems with mass imbalance. We have realized dipole traps with near-infrared laser light in four different wavelength regions between 1050 and 2002 nm. We have identified trap-light-induced processes as the overall dominant source of losses, except for wavelengths around 2000 nm, where light-induced losses appeared to be much weaker. In a trap near 1550 nm, we found a plateau of minimal light-induced losses, and by carefully tuning the wavelength, we reached conditions where losses from inelastic collisions between the trapped dimers became observable. For very weakly bound dimers close to the center of a magnetically tuned Feshbach resonance, we demonstrate the Pauli suppression of collisional losses by about an order of magnitude.

Title: The classical-quantum disproportionation transition and magnetic ordering in RNiO$_3$ nickelates
Authors: A.S. Moskvin, Yu.D. Panov
Abstract: The insulator-quasi-metal (bad metal) transition observed in Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth, or yttrium Y) is considered a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of Hubbard's $U-t$ model. However, in reality, the insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet ($S = 1$) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless ($S = 0$) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. The effective CD-phase Hamiltonian takes into account local ($U$) and nonlocal ($V$) correlations, and the transfer of composite bosons ($t_b$). Within the framework of the effective field approximation, we have shown the existence of two types of CD phases: the high-temperature classical paramagnetic CO-phase of charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and the low-temperature magnetic quantum CDq phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, with ''uncertain valence'' [NiO$_{6}$]$^{(9\pm\delta)-}$ ($0 \le \delta \le 1$) and spin density $(1 \pm \delta)/2$ NiO$_6$-centers. In the classical CO phase, spin-triplet electron centers are surrounded by the nearest nonmagnetic hole centers, which ''turns off'' the strong superexchange interaction of the nearest neighbors. The magnetic ordering in the quantum CDq phase is determined by a strong traditional superexchange and an unusual bosonic double exchange mechanism.

Title: Magnetic order and novel quantum criticality in the strongly interacting quasicrystals
Authors: Cong Zhang, Yin-Kai Yu, Shao-Hang Shi, Zi-Xiang Li
Abstract: We present the sign-problem-free quantum Monte Carlo study of the half-filled Hubbard model on two-dimensional quasicrystals, revealing how specific aperiodic geometries fundamentally dictate quantum criticality. By comparing the Penrose and Thue-Morse quasicrystals, we demonstrate that the nature of the magnetic phase transition is controlled by the electronic density of states (DOS): while the singular DOS of the Penrose tiling induces magnetic order at infinitesimal interaction strengths, the Thue-Morse lattice requires a finite critical interaction to drive the transition. Crucially, through a novel boundary construction strategy and rigorous finite-size scaling, we identify a quantum critical point on the Thue-Morse quasicrystal with critical exponents ($\nu \approx 0.94$, $\beta \approx 0.72$ and $z\approx 1.51$) that deviate significantly from the conventional $(2+1)$D Heisenberg $O(3)$ class. These findings establish the existence of a novel universality class driven by the interplay between electronic correlations and aperiodic geometry, challenging standard paradigms of magnetic criticality in two dimensions.

Title: Flow topology classification of limit cycles
Authors: Thomas Mutschler, Greta Villa, Oded Zilberberg
Abstract: Recent topological tools offer a powerful way to classify how phases of nonlinear bosonic resonators are organized. Yet, they remain incomplete. In particular, self-sustained oscillations in the form of limit cycles act as robust organizing centers in phase space that are not captured by existing fixed-point-based approaches. In this work, we extend the flow topology framework for nonlinear resonators to include limit cycles as fundamental topological elements. Using a graph-based construction, we show how periodic attractors impact the global connectivity of phase-space flows. We illustrate the approach with a minimal nonlinear Van der Pol resonator model, where limit cycles coexist with stationary points. Our results provide a unified topological description of stationary and time-periodic phases in nonlinear bosonic systems, with direct relevance to photonic, superconducting, and optomechanical platforms, and raise new questions on synchronization and the extension of flow topology to the quantum regime.

Title: Electronic and optical properties of native point defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$
Authors: Henry Phillip Fried, Daniel Barragan-Yani, Ludger Wirtz
Abstract: We present a detailed study of common intrinsic defects in CuInS$_2$ and CuGaS$_2$ using the Heyd, Scuseria and Ernzerhof (HSE) hybrid functional scheme. The impact of the two HSE parameters, $\alpha$ and $\omega$ on the band gap and compliance with the generalized Koopmans' theorem is investigated. Using the formation energy formalism and calculated thermodynamic charge-transition levels, we assess the electronic properties of the defects and explore the connection of charge-transition levels with optical-transition levels. Calculated Franck-Condon shifts for emission highlight the importance of lattice relaxation for the attribution of defects to luminescence peaks. Our results show that once these effects are included, predictions become closer to photoluminescence measurements available in literature.

Title: Ferromagnetic resonance in an antiferromagnetic crystal EuSn$_2$As$_2$
Authors: I. I. Gimazov, D. E. Zhelezniakova, R. B. Zaripov, Yu. I. Talanov, A. Yu. Levakhova, A. V. Sadakov, K. S. Pervakov, V. A. Vlasenko, A. L. Vasiliev, V. M. Pudalov
Abstract: We report results of electron spin resonance (ESR) measurements in single crystals of EuSn$_2$As$_2$. In the temperature range of antiferromagnetic (AFM) ordering of Eu atoms, $T \leq T_N\approx 24$\,K, the ESR signal splits into two resonance lines, one of which, at high-field (or low-frequency), is the conventional acoustic AFM resonance mode that occurs at temperatures below $T_N$. The lower-field (high-frequency) line, as we have proven here, is the ferromagnetic resonance associated with the presence in the layered AFM crystal of a small amount ($\sim 3\%$) of planar nanodefects with a non-zero ferromagnetic (FM) moment. The existence of ferromagnetic nano-inclusions in the bulk of the antiferromagnetic compound makes EuSn$_2$As$_2$ a peculiar example of a natural magnetic metamaterial. We believe that the planar FM nanodefects are also inherent in other layered AFM compounds, which explains often observed increase in their magnetic susceptibility upon cooling at $T< T_N\rightarrow 0$.

Title: Vortex core spectroscopy links pseudogap and Lifshitz critical point in a cuprate superconductor
Authors: Tejas Parasram Singar, Ivan Maggio-Aprile, Genda Gu, Christoph Renner
Abstract: Understanding how superconductivity competes with other electronic phases in cuprates requires direct access to the hidden non-superconducting low temperature phase, for which Abrikosov vortices provide a unique local probe. We map the doping- and field-dependent evolution of vortex-core states in Bi$_{2}$Sr$_{2}$CaCu$_{2}$O$_{8+\delta}$ across a broad doping range spanning the Fermi-surface Lifshitz transition. High-resolution scanning tunneling spectroscopy reveals a striking transformation of the vortex-core spectrum from unconventional, pseudogap-like signatures at moderate doping to more BCS-like behavior beyond a critical doping $p^* \approx 0.21$. This crossover aligns with the pseudogap endpoint and the onset of Fermi-surface reconstruction, indicating a direct link between pseudogap physics and vortex electronic structure. Our findings highlight the vortex core as a sensitive local probe of the cuprate ground state.

Title: Nonreciprocal Transport in chiral Mo3Al2C Near the Superconducting to Normal Transition
Authors: Jeongsoo Park, Sang-Wook Cheong, Xianghan Xu
Abstract: We investigate nonreciprocal electrical transport in bulk single-crystalline Mo3Al2C, a material known to host crystallographic chirality, a polar charge-density-wave instability, and a superconducting transition near 8 K. Using AC transport measurements to analyze the first-harmonic and second-harmonic resistance responses, we observe a distinct nonreciprocal second-harmonic signal that is significantly enhanced near the boundary of the normal and superconducting phases. Phenomenologically, this response arises from direction-dependent coupling between the external magnetic field and the current-induced intrinsic magnetization within the chiral lattice. Furthermore, a persistent nonreciprocal response observed under perpendicular magnetic fields suggests a toroidal-induced effect linked to the electric polarization emerging from the charge-density-wave phase. These results demonstrate that bulk Mo3Al2C serves as an intrinsic platform for tunable nonreciprocal transport rooted in the interplay of chirality, polarity, and superconductivity.

Title: CrFe2Ge2: Investigation of novel ferromagnetic material of Fe13Ge8-type crystal
Authors: P.L.S. Cambalame, B.J.C. Vieira, J.C. Waerenborgh, P.S.P. da Silva, J.A. Paixão
Abstract: We successfully synthesized a novel intermetallic compound $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ with the $\rm Fe_{13}Ge_{8}$-type crystal structure. A structural study is presented combining single-crystal X-ray diffraction and Mössbauer spectroscopy analysis, confirming the presence of two distinct Fe sublattices. $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ exhibits a metallic ferromagnetic state with $T_C \approx \rm 200~K$. This material does not follow the usual $M^2 \propto H/M$ Arrott law, rather a modified Arrott law is obeyed in this material. The critical exponents determined from detailed analysis of modified Arrott plots were found to be $\beta = 0.392$, $\gamma = 1.309$ and $\delta = 4.26$ obtained from the critical isotherm at $ T_{\rm C} =\rm 200~K$. Self-consistency and reliability of the critical exponent analysis were verified by the Widom scaling law and scaling equations. Using the results from renormalization group calculation, the critical behavior of $\rm CrFe_2Ge_2$ is akin to that of a $d=3, n=3$ ferromagnet in which the magnetic exhange distance is found to decay as $J(r) \approx r^{-4.86}$ with long-range magnetic coupling. The evaluated Rhodes-Wohlfarth ratio of $\sim 3$ points to an itinerant ferromagnetic ground state. Low-temperature measurements of resistivity, $p(T)$, and specific heat, $C_P(T)$, reveal a pronounced contribution from electron-magnon scattering.

Title: Transition from Population to Coherence-dominated Non-diffusive Thermal Transport
Authors: Laurenz Kremeyer, Bradley J. Siwick, Samuel Huberman
Abstract: Deviations from diffusive heat transport in high thermal conductivity crystalline insulators are generally understood within the framework of the phonon Boltzmann Transport Equation. However, for low thermal conductivity materials with large primitive cells or strong anharmonicity, the recently developed Wigner Transport Equation is more appropriate as it includes tunnelling between overlapping phonon bands. In this work, via solutions to the Wigner Transport Equation, we develop a scheme to obtain the dynamics of the phonon populations and coherences as a function of an arbitrary heat source. The approach is applied to predict size effects and dynamical thermal conductivities in CsPbBr3 and La2Zr2O7 using first-principles data as input. We predict significant deviations from the bulk thermal conductivity in these materials at length scales on the order of hundreds of nanometers to a few microns at room temperature, well within the reach of direct observation using current experimental techniques.

Title: Rapid synthesis of dual-element isotope-enriched alpha-MoO3 crystals by reactive vapor transport
Authors: Ryan W. Spangler, Jacob M. Shusterman, Anton V. Ievlev, Patrick E. Hopkins, Joshua D. Caldwell, Jon-Paul Maria
Abstract: In this work, we develop a rapid reactive vapor transport technique to efficiently utilize limited isotopically pure precursors, particularly gaseous 18O2, and synthesize mm-scale, high-quality crystals within few-minute growth durations. We unlock this capability by using metallic molybdenum precursors with high source temperatures (900 C) and total pressures (1 atm) to maximize precursor efficiency and yield. Subsequently, we grow MoO3 single crystals with high and uniform enrichment levels of 98Mo and 18O isotopes in several different permutations. As probed by Raman spectroscopy, modest and significant phonon energy redshifts occur following 98Mo and 18O enrichment, respectively. By demonstrating control over both molybdenum and oxygen isotopic fractions, we establish a powerful tool to advance nanophotonics and thermal management goals using MoO3. This work is motivated by the possibility to enhance and engineer lattice vibrational mode phenomena including thermal conduction and hyperbolic phonon polariton (HPhP) dispersion, with particular interest in comparing the effects of light and heavy element enrichment.

Title: Nonreciprocal Transport with Quantum Geometric Origin in Layered Hybrid Perovskite

Abstract: Quantum geometry quantifies how the electron wavefunction evolves distinctly from conventional transport theory. In noncentrosymmetric materials, nonreciprocal transport with quantum geometric origin remains prominent with localized charge independent of vanished group velocity. The discovery of such nonreciprocal and nonlinear responses was realized by recent advances in two-dimensional materials. As a promising candidate, the electronic structure and symmetry of layered hybrid perovskites can be deliberately designed and manipulated by incorporating selected organic ligands. Despite the observation of exotic photogalvanic effects and chiral optical effects, the underlying mechanism how these nonlinear responses are enabled in the multi-quantum well structures remained unclear. Here we demonstrated the quantum geometric origin for interlayer spontaneous photocurrent in (PEA)2PbI4. Contrary to assumptions that charge transport across the 2D planes is limited, we observed a spontaneous photocurrent along this crystalline orientation. Theoretical analysis using a tight-binding model identifies shift current as the microscopic origin. This quantum geometric effect is enabled by ionic displacements from centrosymmetric coordinates and enhanced by multiband transition high-density bands of the layered hybrid crystal. We anticipate that such unique low-dimensional systems with structure can provide fertile ground for discovering novel optoelectronic functionalities.

Title: Adaptive Path Integral Diffusion: AdaPID
Authors: Michael Chertkov, Hamidreza Behjoo (University of Arizona)
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers -- Score Based Diffusions, Bridge Diffusions and Path Integral Diffusions -- match a target at terminal time, but the real leverage comes from choosing the schedule that governs the intermediate-time dynamics. We develop a path-wise schedule -- selection gramework for Harmonic PID with a time-varying stiffness, exploiting Piece-Wise-Constant(PWC) parametrizations and a simple hierarchical refinement. We introduce schedule-sensitive Quality-of-Sampling (QoS) diagnostics. Assuming a Gaussian-Mixture (GM) target, we retain closed-form Green functions' ration and numerically stable, Neural-Network free oracles for predicted-state maps and score. Experiments in 2D show that QoS driven PWC schedules consistently improve early-exit fidelity, tail accuracy, conditioning of the dynamics, and speciation (label-selection) timing at fixed integration budgets.

Title: Generative Stochastic Optimal Transport: Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion
Authors: Michael Chertkov (University of Arizona)
Abstract: We introduce Guided Harmonic Path-Integral Diffusion (GH-PID), a linearly-solvable framework for guided Stochastic Optimal Transport (SOT) with a hard terminal distribution and soft, application-driven path costs. A low-dimensional guidance protocol shapes the trajectory ensemble while preserving analytic structure: the forward and backward Kolmogorov equations remain linear, the optimal score admits an explicit Green-function ratio, and Gaussian-Mixture Model (GMM) terminal laws yield closed-form expressions. This enables stable sampling and differentiable protocol learning under exact terminal matching. We develop guidance-centric diagnostics -- path cost, centerline adherence, variance flow, and drift effort -- that make GH-PID an interpretable variational ansatz for empirical SOT. Three navigation scenarios illustrated in 2D: (i) Case A: hand-crafted protocols revealing how geometry and stiffness shape lag, curvature effects, and mode evolution; (ii) Case B: single-task protocol learning, where a PWC centerline is optimized to minimize integrated cost; (iii) Case C: multi-expert fusion, in which a commander reconciles competing expert/teacher trajectories and terminal beliefs through an exact product-of-experts law and learns a consensus protocol. Across all settings, GH-PID generates geometry-aware, trust-aware trajectories that satisfy the prescribed terminal distribution while systematically reducing integrated cost.

Title: AGAPI-Agents: An Open-Access Agentic AI Platform for Accelerated Materials Design on AtomGPT.org
Authors: Jaehyung Lee, Justin Ely, Kent Zhang, Akshaya Ajith, Charles Rhys Campbell, Kamal Choudhary
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is reshaping scientific discovery, yet its use in materials research remains limited by fragmented computational ecosystems, reproducibility challenges, and dependence on commercial large language models (LLMs). Here we introduce AGAPI (this http URL API), an open-access agentic AI platform that integrates more than eight open-source LLMs with over twenty materials-science API endpoints, unifying databases, simulation tools, and machine-learning models through a common orchestration framework. AGAPI employs an Agent-Planner-Executor-Summarizer architecture that autonomously constructs and executes multi-step workflows spanning materials data retrieval, graph neural network property prediction, machine-learning force-field optimization, tight-binding calculations, diffraction analysis, and inverse design. We demonstrate AGAPI through end-to-end workflows, including heterostructure construction, powder X-ray diffraction analysis, and semiconductor defect engineering requiring up to ten sequential operations. In addition, we evaluate AGAPI using 30+ example prompts as test cases and compare agentic predictions with and without tool access against experimental data. With more than 1,000 active users, AGAPI provides a scalable and transparent foundation for reproducible, AI-accelerated materials discovery. AGAPI-Agents codebase is available at this https URL.

Title: Classifying GNY-like models
Authors: Matthew S. Mitchell, David Poland
Abstract: We perform a systematic classification of (2+1)d Gross--Neveu--Yukawa-like models built out of one or more 4-component Dirac fermions and $M$ scalar fields, which preserve an O($M$) symmetry rotating the scalars. We then identify the perturbative fixed points of these models in the $4-\epsilon$ expansion. Our classification highlights several targets for the conformal bootstrap and reveals a new fixed point with $M=3$, which we call the "orthogonal Heisenberg" CFT.

Title: Holographic Representation of One-Dimensional Many-Body Quantum States via Isometric Tensor Networks
Authors: Kaito Kobayashi, Benjamin Sappler, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: Isometric tensor network states (isoTNS) allow for efficient and accurate simulations of higher-dimensional quantum systems by enforcing an isometric structure. We bring this idea back to one dimension by introducing a holographic isoTNS ansatz: a (1+1)-dimensional lattice of isometric tensors where the horizontal axis encodes physical space and an auxiliary "holographic" axis boosts expressivity. Despite the enlarged geometry, contractions and local updates remain computationally efficient due to isometric constraints. We investigate this ansatz and benchmark it in comparison to matrix product states (MPS). First, we show that randomly initialized holographic isoTNS typically display volume-law entanglement even at modest bond dimension, surpassing the representational limits of MPS and related ansätze. Second, through analytic constructions and variational optimization, we demonstrate that holographic isoTNS can faithfully represent arbitrary fermionic Gaussian states, Clifford states, and certain short-time-evolved states under local evolution -- a family of states that is highly entangled but low in complexity. Third, to exploit this expressivity in broad situations, we implement a time-evolving block decimation (TEBD) algorithm on holographic isoTNS. While the method remains efficient and scalable, error accumulation over TEBD sweeps suppresses entanglement and leads to rapid deviations from exact dynamics. Overall, holographic isoTNS broaden the reach of tensor-network methods, opening new avenues to study physics in the volume-law regime.

Title: Uniform matrix product states with a boundary
Authors: Marta Florido-Llinàs, Álvaro M. Alhambra, David Pérez-García, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Canonical forms are central to the analytical understanding of tensor network states, underpinning key results such as the complete classification of one-dimensional symmetry-protected topological phases within the matrix product state (MPS) framework. Yet, the established theory applies only to uniform MPS with periodic boundary conditions, leaving many physically relevant states beyond its reach. Here we introduce a generalized canonical form for uniform MPS with a boundary matrix, thus extending the analytical MPS framework to a more general setting of wider physical significance. This canonical form reveals that any such MPS can be represented as a block-invertible matrix product operator acting on a structured class of algebraic regular language states that capture its essential long-range and scale-invariant features. Our construction builds on new algebraic results of independent interest that characterize the span and algebra generated by non-semisimple sets of matrices, including a generalized quantum Wielandt's inequality that gives an explicit upper bound on the blocking length at which the fixed-length span stabilizes to an algebra. Together, these results establish a unified theoretical foundation for uniform MPS with boundaries, bridging the gap between periodic and arbitrary-boundary settings, and providing the basis for extending key analytical and classification results of matrix product states to a much broader class of states and operators.

Title: Anomalies on ALE spaces and phases of gauge theory
Authors: Mohamed M. Anber
Abstract: We show that certain 't~Hooft anomalies that evade detection on commonly used closed four-dimensional manifolds become visible when a quantum field theory is placed on asymptotically locally Euclidean (ALE) spaces. As a concrete example, we use the Eguchi-Hanson (EH) space, whose defining features are its nontrivial second cohomology generated by the self-intersecting two-sphere and its asymptotic boundary $\mathbb{RP}^3$, which carries torsion and thus furnishes additional cohomological data absent on conventional backgrounds. For a theory with symmetry $G_1\times G_2$, we turn on background flux for $G_1$ and probe potential anomalies by performing a global $G_2$ transformation; the resulting anomaly is captured by a five-dimensional mapping torus. The anomaly receives contributions from the four-dimensional characteristic classes on EH space as well as from the $\eta$-invariant associated with the $\mathbb{RP}^3$ boundary. The anomaly uncovered in this way leads to new constraints on asymptotically free gauge theories. In particular, infrared composite spectra that successfully match anomalies on standard manifolds may nevertheless fail to reproduce the EH anomaly, and can therefore be excluded as the complete infrared realization of the symmetries.

Title: Proof of Spin-Statistics Theorem in Quantum Mechanics of Identical Particles
Authors: Takafumi Kita
Abstract: A nonrelativistic proof of the spin-statistics theorem is given in terms of the field operators satisfying commutation and anticommutation relations, which are introduced here in the coordinate space as a means to build the permutation symmetry into the brackets of identical particles. An eigenvalue problem of a $\pi$-rotation for a product of two annihilation operators is combined with an analysis on its rotational property to prove the connection that the field operators for integral-spin and half-integral-spin particles obey the commutation and anticommutation relations, respectively.

Title: Leveraging Symmetry Merging in Pauli Propagation
Authors: Yanting Teng, Su Yeon Chang, Manuel S. Rudolph, Zoë Holmes
Abstract: We introduce a symmetry-adapted framework for simulating quantum dynamics based on Pauli propagation. When a quantum circuit possesses a symmetry, many Pauli strings evolve redundantly under actions of the symmetry group. We exploit this by merging Pauli strings related through symmetry transformations. This procedure, formalized as the symmetry-merging Pauli propagation algorithm, propagates only a minimal set of orbit representatives. Analytically, we show that symmetry merging reduces space complexity by a factor set by orbit sizes, with explicit gains for translation and permutation symmetries. Numerical benchmarks of all-to-all Heisenberg dynamics confirm improved stability, particularly under truncation and noise. Our results establish a group-theoretic framework for enhancing Pauli propagation, supported by open-source code demonstrating its practical relevance for classical quantum-dynamics simulations.

Title: A discontinuous percolation phase transition on the hierarchical lattice
Authors: Johannes Bäumler, Tom Hutchcroft
Abstract: For long-range percolation on $\mathbb{Z}$ with translation-invariant edge kernel $J$, it is a classical theorem of Aizenman and Newman (1986) that the phase transition is discontinuous when $J(x,y)$ is of order $|x-y|^{-2}$ and that there is no phase transition at all when $J(x,y)=o(|x-y|^{-2})$. We prove a strengthened version of this theorem for the hierarchical lattice, where the relevant threshold is at $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ rather than $|x-y|^{-2}$: There is a continuous phase transition for kernels of larger order, a discontinuous phase transition for kernels of exactly this order, and no phase transition at all for kernels of smaller order. As such, $|x-y|^{-2d} \log\log |x-y|$ is essentially the \emph{only} kernel that produces a discontinuous phase transition. We also prove a hierarchical analogue of the ``$M^2\beta=1$'' conjecture of Imbrie and Newman (1988), which gives an exact formula for the density of the infinite cluster at the point of discontinuous phase transition and remains open in the Euclidean setting.

Title: Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions in a laser-cooled Ca+ matrix

Abstract: We report on the sympathetic cooling and Coulomb crystallization of xenon highly charged ions (HCIs) with laser-cooled Ca$^+$ ions. The HCIs are produced in a compact electron beam ion trap, then charge selected, decelerated, and finally injected into a cryogenic linear Paul trap. There, they are captured into $^{40}$Ca$^+$ Coulomb crystals, and co-crystallized within them, causing dark voids in their fluorescence images. Fine control over the number of trapped ions and HCIs allows us to realize mixed-species crystals with arbitrary ordering patterns. By investigating Xe$^{q+}$--Ca$^+$ strings, we confirm the HCI charge states, measure their lifetime and characterize the mixed-species motional modes. Our system effectively combines the established quantum control toolbox for Ca$^+$ with the rich set of atomic properties of Xe highly charged ions, providing a resourceful platform for optical frequency metrology, searches for signatures of new physics, and quantum information science.

Title: Complete Topological Quantization of Higher Gauge Fields
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: After global completion of higher gauge fields (as appearing in higher-dimensional supergravity) by proper flux quantization in extraordinary nonabelian cohomology, the (non-perturbative, renormalized) topological quantum observables and quantum states of solitonic field histories are completely determined through a topological form of light-front quantization. We survey the logic of this construction and expand on aspects of the quantization argument. In the instructive example of 5D Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the gauge sector of 5D SuGra) dimensionally reduced to 3D, a suitable choice of flux quantization in Cohomotopy ("Hypothesis h") recovers this way the fine detail of the traditionally renormalized (Wilson loop) quantum observables of abelian Chern-Simons theory and makes novel predictions about anyons in fractional quantum (anomalous) Hall systems. An analogous choice ("Hypothesis H") of global completion of 11D higher Maxwell-Chern-Simons theory (the higher gauge sector of 11D SuGra) realizes various aspects of the topological sector of the conjectural "M-theory" and its M5-branes.

Title: A Software Package for Generating Robust and Accurate Potentials using the Moment Tensor Potential Framework
Authors: Josiah Roberts, Biswas Rijal, Simon Divilov, Jon-Paul Maria, William G. Fahrenholtz, Douglas E. Wolfe, Donald W. Brenner, Stefano Curtarolo, Eva Zurek
Abstract: We present the Plan for Robust and Accurate Potentials (PRAPs), a software package for training and using moment tensor potentials (MTPs) in concert with the Machine Learned Interatomic Potentials (MLIP) software package. PRAPs provides an automated workflow to train MTPs using active learning procedures, and a variety of utilities to ease and improve workflows when utilizing the MLIP software. PRAPs was originally developed in the context of crystal structure prediction, in which one calculates convex hulls and predicts low energy metastable and thermodynamically stable structures, but the potentials PRAPs develops are not limited to such applications. PRAPs produces two potentials, one capable of rough estimates of the energies, forces and stresses of almost any chemical structure in the specified compositional space -- the Robust Potential -- and a second potential intended to provide more accurate descriptions of ground state and metastable structures -- the Accurate Potential. We also present a Python library, mliputils, designed to assist users in working with the chemical structural files used by the MLIP package.

Title: Pattern Formation Beyond Turing: Physical Principles of Mass-Conserving Reaction--Diffusion Systems
Authors: Erwin Frey, Henrik Weyer
Abstract: Intracellular protein patterns govern essential cellular functions by dynamically redistributing proteins between membrane-bound and cytosolic states, conserving their total numbers. This review presents a theoretical framework for understanding such patterns based on mass-conserving reaction--diffusion systems. The emergence, selection, and evolution of patterns are analyzed in terms of mass redistribution and interface motion, resulting in mesoscale laws of coarsening and wavelength selection. A geometric phase-space perspective provides a conceptual tool to link local reactive equilibria with global pattern dynamics through conserved mass fluxes. The Min protein system of \emph{Escherichia coli} provides a paradigmatic example, enabling direct comparison between theory and experiment. Successive model refinements capture both the robustness of pattern formation and the diversity of dynamic regimes observed \emph{in vivo} and \emph{in vitro}. The Min system thus illustrates how to extract predictive, multiscale theory from biochemical detail, providing a foundation for understanding pattern formation in more complex and synthetic systems.

Abstract: Practical quantum computers need to continuously exchange data between classical and quantum subsystems during a computation. Mid-circuit measurements of a qubits state are transferred to the classical electronics layer, and their outcome can inform feedforward operations that close the loop back to the quantum layer. These operations are crucial for fault-tolerant quantum computers, but the quantum-classical loop must be completed before the qubits decohere, presenting a substantial engineering challenge for full-scale systems comprising millions of qubits. Here we perform the first mid-circuit measurements in a system of silicon spin qubits, and show that feedforward operations can be performed without needing to route information to the classical layer. This in-layer approach leverages a backaction-driven control technique that has previously been considered a source of error. We benchmark our in-layer strategy, together with the standard FPGA-enabled approach, and analyse the performance of both methods using gate set tomography. Our results provide the first step towards moving resource-intensive classical processing into the quantum layer, an advance that could solve key engineering challenges, and drastically reduce the power budget of future quantum computers.

Title: Universal Supercritical Behavior in Global Monopole-Charged AdS Black Holes
Authors: Ankit Anand, Shoucheng Wang
Abstract: We analytically investigate the Widom line and universal supercritical crossover for charged AdS black holes threaded by a global monopole. We compute thermodynamic variables in both the extended and canonical ensembles. We derive the scaled variance $\Omega$ using the Gibbs free energy and locate the Widom line as the extrema of this. Using mean-field expansion of the equation of state near criticality, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$. We show that the monopole parameter shifts the critical parameters but does not change the mean-field universal scaling: the leading linear term and the nonanalytic correction remain universal in both ensembles. We also verify this with numerical computation and show the Widom line and the two branching crossover lines $L_\pm$.

Title: Random matrix theory of sparse neuronal networks with heterogeneous timescales
Authors: Thiparat Chotibut, Oleg Evnin, Weerawit Horinouchi
Abstract: Training recurrent neuronal networks consisting of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) units with additive noise for working memory computation slows and diversifies inhibitory timescales, leading to improved task performance that is attributed to emergent marginally stable equilibria [PNAS 122 (2025) e2316745122]. Yet the link between trained network characteristics and their roles in shaping desirable dynamical landscapes remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the Jacobian matrices describing the dynamics near these equilibria and show that they are sparse, non-Hermitian rectangular-block matrices modified by heterogeneous synaptic decay timescales and activation-function gains. We specify a random matrix ensemble that faithfully captures the spectra of trained Jacobian matrices, arising from the inhibitory core - excitatory periphery network motif (pruned E weights, broadly distributed I weights) observed post-training. An analytic theory of this ensemble is developed using statistical field theory methods: a Hermitized resolvent representation of the spectral density processed with a supersymmetry-based treatment in the style of Fyodorov and Mirlin. In this manner, an analytic description of the spectral edge is obtained, relating statistical parameters of the Jacobians (sparsity, weight variances, E/I ratio, and the distributions of timescales and gains) to near-critical features of the equilibria essential for robust working memory computation.

Title: Sensitivity increase of 3D printed, self-sensing, carbon fibers structures with conductive filament matrix due to flexural loading
Authors: Matei Drilea, Alexander Dijkshoorn, Gusthavo Ribeiro Salomão, Stefano Stramigioli, Gijs Krijnen
Abstract: The excellent structural and piezoresistive properties of continuous carbon fiber make it suitable for both structural and sensing applications. This work studies the use of 3D printed, continuous carbon fiber reinforced beams as self-sensing structures. It is demonstrated how the sensitivity of these carbon fiber strain gauges can be increased irreversibly by means of a pretreatment by ``breaking-in'' the sensors with a large compressive bending load. The increase in the gauge factor is attributed to local progressive fiber failure, due to the combination of the thermal residual stress from the printing process and external loading. The coextrusion of conductive filament around the carbon fibers is demonstrated as a means of improving the reliability, noise and electrical connection of the sensors. A micrograph of the sensor cross section shows that the conductive filament contacts the various carbon fiber bundles. All-in-all, the use of ``breaking-in'' carbon fiber strain gauges in combination with coextrusion of conductive filament hold promises for 3D printed structural sensors with a high sensitivity.

Title: Local Quantum Friction with Pairing: Unitary Dissipation in Large Fermi Systems
Authors: J. E. Alba-Arroyo, Daniel Pęcak, Michael McNeil Forbes, Gabriel Wlazłowski
Abstract: We present a unitary framework for dissipative quantum dynamics that can be efficiently applied to large-scale Fermi systems. The method introduces local Hermitian operators that emulate frictional forces while strictly preserving the unitarity of time evolution. Unlike approaches based on the Lindblad equation, our formulation scales favorably with system size and can be seamlessly integrated into time-dependent density functional theory frameworks. We demonstrate that energy dissipation arises from the damping of particle currents and pairing-field fluctuations. Furthermore, we develop a variant of the scheme that allows the particle number to vary in time, enabling controlled density scans. The method is generic and versatile, as illustrated by applications to spin-imbalanced unitary Fermi gases and to nuclear matter in the neutron-star crust. The framework can be naturally extended to include stochastic noise, providing a foundation for studying fluctuation-dissipation dynamics and thermalization in strongly interacting Fermi superfluids.

Title: Imaginary-time-enhanced feedback-based quantum algorithms for universal ground-state preparation
Authors: Thanh Nguyen Van Long, Lan Nguyen Tran, Le Bin Ho
Abstract: Preparing ground states of strongly correlated quantum systems is a central goal in quantum simulation and optimization. The feedback-based quantum algorithm (FALQON) provides an attractive alternative to variational methods with a fully quantum feedback rule, but it fails in the presence of spectral degeneracies, where the feedback signal collapses and the evolution cannot reach the ground state. Using the Fermi-Hubbard model on lattices up to 3x3, we show that this breakdown appears at half-filling on the 2x2 lattice and extends to both half-filled and doped configurations on the 3x3 lattice. We then introduce an imaginary-time-enhanced FALQON (ITE-FALQON) scheme, which inserts short imaginary-time evolution steps into the feedback loop. The hybrid method suppresses excited-state components, escapes degenerate subspaces, and restores monotonic energy descent. The ITE-FALQON achieves a reliable ground-state convergence across all fillings, providing a practical route to scalable ground-state preparation in strongly correlated quantum systems.

Title: The emergence of long-range entanglement and odd-even effect in periodic generalized cluster models
Authors: Zhen-Yu Zheng, Shu Chen
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement properties in a generalized cluster model under periodic boundary condition. By evaluating the entanglement entropy and the quantum conditional mutual information entropy under three or four subsystem partitions, we identify clear signatures of long-range entanglement. Specifically, when both the system size $N$ and the interaction range $m$ are odd, the system exhibits nonzero four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropies. This non-vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy directly signals the presence of long-range entanglement. In contrast, all other combination of $N$ and $m$ yield vanishing four-part quantum conditional mutual information entropy. Remarkably, in the case of $N, m \in \text{odd}$, these long-range entangled features persist even in the presence of a finite transverse field, demonstrating their robustness against quantum fluctuations. These results demonstrate how the interplay between system size and interaction range governs the emergence of long-range entanglement in one-dimensional spin systems.

Title: Neural quantum states for entanglement depth certification from randomized Pauli measurements
Authors: Marcin Płodzień
Abstract: Entanglement depth quantifies how many qubits share genuine multipartite entanglement, but certification typically relies on tailored witnesses or full tomography, both of which scale poorly with system size. We recast entanglement-depth and non-$k$-separability certification as likelihood-based model selection among neural quantum states whose architecture enforces a chosen entanglement constraint. A hierarchy of separable neural quantum states is trained on finite-shot local Pauli outcomes and compared against an unconstrained reference model trained on the same data. When all constrained models are statistically disfavored, the data certify entanglement beyond the imposed limit directly from measurement statistics, without reconstructing the density matrix. We validate the method on simulated six- and ten-qubit datasets targeting GHZ, Dicke, and Bell-pair states, and demonstrate robustness for mixed states under local noise. Finally, we discuss lightweight interpretability diagnostics derived from trained parameters that expose coarse entanglement patterns and qubit groupings directly from bitstring statistics.

Title: Intense-Laser Nondipole-Induced Symmetry Breaking in Solids
Authors: Asger Weeth, Lars Bojer Madsen
Abstract: High-harmonic spectroscopy in solids gives insight into the inner workings of solids, such as reconstructing band structures or probing the topological phase of materials. High-harmonic generation (HHG) is a highly non-linear phenomena and simulations guide interpretation of experimental results. These simulations often rely on the electric dipole approximation, even though the driving fields enter regimes that challenge its accuracy. Here, we investigate effects of including nondipole terms in the light-matter coupling in simulations of HHG in materials with both topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. We show how the inclusion of nondipole terms breaks dipole selection rules, allowing for new polarizations of the generated light. Specifically we find that helicity, completely absent in the dipole approximation, is induced by the nondipole extension, and that this helicity is dependent on the topological phase of the material.

Title: Quantum critical dynamics and emergent universality in decoherent digital quantum processors
Authors: Brendan Rhyno, Swarnadeep Majumder, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi
Abstract: Understanding how noise influences nonequilibrium quantum critical dynamics is essential for both fundamental physics and the development of practical quantum technologies. While the quantum Kibble-Zurek (QKZ) mechanism predicts universal scaling during quenches across a critical point, real quantum systems exhibit complex decoherence that can substantially modify these behaviors, ranging from altering critical scaling to completely suppressing it. By considering a specific case of nondemolishing noise, we first show how decoherence can reshape universal scaling and verify these theoretical predictions using numerical simulations of spin chains across a wide range of noise strengths. Then, we study linear quenches in the transverse-field Ising model on IBM superconducting processors where the noise model is unknown. Using large system sizes of 80-120 qubits, we measure equal-time connected correlations, defect densities, and excess energies across various quench times. Surprisingly, unlike earlier observations where noise-induced defect production masked universal behavior at long times, we observe clear scaling relations, pointing towards persistent universal structure shaped by decoherence. The extracted scaling exponents differ from both ideal QKZ predictions and analytic results for simplified noise models, suggesting the emergence of a distinct noise-influenced universality regime. Our results, therefore, point toward the possibility of using universal dynamical scaling as a high-level descriptor of quantum hardware, complementary to conventional gate-level performance metrics.

Title: PolySet: Restoring the Statistical Ensemble Nature of Polymers for Machine Learning
Authors: Khalid Ferji
Abstract: Machine-learning (ML) models in polymer science typically treat a polymer as a single, perfectly defined molecular graph, even though real materials consist of stochastic ensembles of chains with distributed lengths. This mismatch between physical reality and digital representation limits the ability of current models to capture polymer behaviour. Here we introduce PolySet, a framework that represents a polymer as a finite, weighted ensemble of chains sampled from an assumed molar-mass distribution. This ensemble-based encoding is independent of chemical detail, compatible with any molecular representation and illustrated here in the homopolymer case using a minimal language model. We show that PolySet retains higher-order distributional moments (such as Mz, Mz+1), enabling ML models to learn tail-sensitive properties with greatly improved stability and accuracy. By explicitly acknowledging the statistical nature of polymer matter, PolySet establishes a physically grounded foundation for future polymer machine learning, naturally extensible to copolymers, block architectures, and other complex topologies.

Title: Time-Crystalline Phase in a Single-Band Holographic Superconductor
Authors: Chi-Hsien Tai, Wen-Yu Wen
Abstract: We investigate the emergence of a time-crystalline phase in a single-band holographic superconductor, extending the AdS/CFT framework. By incorporating a nonlinear gauge-scalar coupling and external driving, we derive coupled equations of motion for the plasma and Higgs modes, analogous to those in high-Tc superconductors. Multi-scale analysis reveals a sum resonance with subharmonic growth indicating broken time-translation symmetry. We perform numerical computation of quasinormal mode and demonstrate the transition to the time-crystalline phase. The holographic model may serve as a robust tool for studying strongly coupled time crystals.

Title: Gibbs state postulate from dynamical stability - Redundancy of the zeroth law
Authors: Vjosa Blakaj, Matthias C. Caro, Anouar Kouraich, Daniel Malz, Michael M. Wolf
Abstract: Gibbs states play a central role in quantum statistical mechanics as the standard description of thermal equilibrium. Traditionally, their use is justified either by a heuristic, a posteriori reasoning, or by derivations based on notions of typicality or passivity. In this work, we show that Gibbs states are completely characterized by assuming dynamical stability of the system itself and of the system in weak contact with an arbitrary environment. This builds on and strengthens a result by Frigerio, Gorini, and Verri (1986), who derived Gibbs states from dynamical stability using an additional assumption that they referred to as the "zeroth law of thermodynamics", as it concerns a nested dynamical stability of a triple of systems. We prove that this zeroth law is redundant and that an environment consisting solely of harmonic oscillators is sufficient to single out Gibbs states as the only dynamically stable states.

Title: Multi-Photon Lasing Phenomena in Quantum Dot-Cavity QED
Authors: Lavakumar Addepalli
Abstract: Multi-photon lasing has been realized in systems with strong nonlinear interactions between emitters and cavity modes, where single-photon processes are suppressed. Coherence between the internal states of a quantum emitter, or among multiple emitters, plays a key role. Such continuous nonclassical sources of light can find applications in quantum computation, quantum sensing, quantum metrology, and quantum communication. This thesis explores the multi-photon lasing phenomena in various quantum dot-photonic crystal cavity quantum electrodynamic (QED) setups. Exciton-phonon interactions are inevitable in such systems and are incorporated using the polaron-transformed master equation. The Born-Markov approximation is employed to obtain the reduced density matrix rate equation. Using quantum laser theory, we derived the Scully-Lamb laser rate equations and evaluated the single- and multi-photon excess emission rates defined as the difference between emission and absorption rates into the cavity mode without mean-field approximations. We investigated cooperative two-photon lasing, correlated emission lasing, hyperradiant lasing, non-degenerate two-mode two-photon lasing, and continuous variable entanglement in open quantum systems with single or multiple semiconductor quantum dots (two-level, three-level, and four-level) driven coherently/incoherently and coupled to single/ bimodal cavities.

Title: Three-qubit entangling gates with simultaneous exchange controls in spin qubit systems
Authors: Miguel G. Rodriguez, Yun-Pil Shim
Abstract: Pairwise exchange couplings have long been the standard mechanism for entangling spin qubits in semiconductor systems. However, implementing quantum circuits based on pairwise exchange gates often requires a lengthy sequence of elementary gate operations. In this work, we present an alternative approach: multi-qubit entangling gate operations that simultaneously drive the exchange couplings between multiple pairs of spin qubits. We explore three spin qubit systems in linear or triangular configurations. We derive analytical expressions for these multi-exchange entangling operations and demonstrate how to use the resulting three-qubit gates to construct quantum circuits capable of generating standard entangled states such as GHZ and W states, and the Toffoli gate, by optimizing control parameters. Our results show that this multi-qubit strategy significantly reduces the number of required operations, offering a pathway to more efficient, shallower, and more coherent circuits for spin-qubit processors.

Title: Thermoplasmonics under optically coupled regime: A Numerical Study of Dimers, Nanolenses, and Switchable Clusters
Authors: José Luis Montaño Priede, Marek Grzelczak
Abstract: The management of thermal effects in plasmonic nanostructures is frequently viewed as a detrimental waste rather than a useful, controllable entity. We show that optical coupling of plasmonic nanoparticles enables precise spatiotemporal control over nanoscale heating. Through numerical investigation of experimentally-achievable systems from individual nanoparticles and dimers to nanolenses and switchable clusters, we demonstrate how plasmon hybridization and near-field coupling dictate the magnitude and spatial distribution of temperature. Our results highlight the critical role of polarization and gap distance in tuning the thermal output of dimers, the ability of a trimer nanolens to focus heat into a sub-diffraction volume, and the pronounced thermal difference in a switchable nanoparticle cluster. This work establishes a framework for designing advanced thermoplasmonic systems where heat is not merely a detriment, but a dynamically controllable element for applications in catalysis, health, or active photonic devices.

Title: Quantum Integrability of Hamiltonians with Time-Dependent Interaction Strengths and the Renormalization Group Flow
Authors: Parameshwar R. Pasnoori
Abstract: In this paper we consider quantum Hamiltonians with time-dependent interaction strengths, and following the recently formulated generalized Bethe ansatz framework [P. R. Pasnoori, Phys. Rev. B 112, L060409 (2025)], we show that constraints imposed by integrability take the same form as the renormalization group flow equations corresponding to the respective Hamiltonians with constant interaction strengths. As a concrete example, we consider the anisotropic time-dependent Kondo model characterized by the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$. We construct an exact solution to the time-dependent Schrodinger equation and by applying appropriate boundary conditions on the fermion fields we obtain a set of matrix difference equations called the quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov (qKZ) equations corresponding to the XXZ R-matrix. The consistency of these equations imposes constraints on the time-dependent interaction strengths $J_{\parallel}(t)$ and $J_{\perp}(t)$, such that the system is integrable. Remarkably, the resulting temporal trajectories of the couplings are shown to coincide exactly with the RG flow trajectories of the static Kondo model, establishing a direct and universal correspondence between integrability and renormalization-group flow in time-dependent quantum systems.

Title: Non-Equilibrium Steady States and Quantum Chaos in a three-site Driven-Dissipative Bose-Hubbard Chains base on Self-Consistent Mean-Field Approach
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: We investigate the non-equilibrium dynamics and steady-state properties of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard chain using a self-consistent Gutzwiller mean-field (GMF) approach. By employing a robust Picard iteration scheme, we solve the non-linear master equation for the non-equilibrium steady state (NESS) in the presence of strong Kerr nonlinearity. We identify two distinct dynamical regimes governed by the interplay between coherent drive, dissipation, and interaction: a regular quasilinear regime and a chaotic regime. Linear stability analysis reveals that the transition to the chaotic regime is triggered by parametric instabilities arising from the drive-induced coherence. Furthermore, we characterize the onset of quantum chaos by calculating the out-of-time-order correlator (OTOC). Our results show that in the strong coupling regime, the OTOC exhibits rapid exponential growth and saturation, providing a clear signature of information scrambling in this open quantum system. The proposed numerical framework offers an efficient pathway to explore many-body correlations in larger photonic lattices.

Title: Ab Initio bulk free energy surface of proper ferroelectrics
Authors: Pinchen Xie, Yixiao Chen, Xinyu Xu, Zhi Yao, Weinan E, Roberto Car
Abstract: We report a systematic and accurate approach for deriving the bulk free energy surface (FES), a function of temperature, polarization, and strain, from the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) of proper ferroelectrics. The core of our approach is the metadynamics algorithm that extracts the polarization dependence of the FES from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without an a priori ansatz. The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.

Title: Near surface concentration profile of sheared semi-dilute polymer solutions
Authors: Suzanne Lafon, Tiago Outerelo-Corvo, Marion Grzelka, Arnaud Hélary, Philipp Gutfreund, Liliane Léger, Alexis Chennevière, Frédéric Restagno
Abstract: Controlling the structure of polymer solutions near a solid surface is crucial for many industrial processes, as it significantly impacts solution flow and influences slip at the interface. To date, only a few techniques have been developed to experimentally investigate this type of interface at the nanometric scale of solid/liquid interaction. In this study, we probe the interface between a smooth sapphire surface and a semi-diluted polystyrene solution, using neutron reflectivity. A special setup for flow measurements under shear has been designed and optimized. Our results show that, at rest, polymer chains are globally depleted from the solid surface. Contrary to common assumptions, some polystyrene chains do adsorb onto the wall. Under flow conditions, we experimentally demonstrate that the depletion layer remains stable, a finding that has been hypothesized but only vaguely confirmed in the literature.

Title: Structured beam controlled super-resolution in quantum dots via rapid adiabatic passage
Authors: Partha Das, Samit Kumar Hazra, Tarak Nath Dey
Abstract: We theoretically investigate rapid adiabatic passage (RAP) based super-resolution microscopy in a two-level quantum dot (QD) system. The system consists of a QD interacting with two structured beams, accompanied by chirping and a time delay. The central concept of this work is inspired by the stimulated emission depletion (STED) microscopy technique. To understand the physical mechanism behind super-resolved spot formation, we employ a variational master equation for the density matrix, incorporating both radiative and non-radiative decay processes. A suitably chosen spatiotemporal envelope of the structured beams enables the formation of a super-resolved image. Unwanted low-intensity circular rings around the focal spot are suppressed using Bessel-modulated truncated structured Laguerre-Gaussian (LG) and super-Gaussian (SG) beams. We also study the temperature dependence of the imaging scheme. The numerical results confirm that at low pulse areas, exciton-phonon coupling distorts the image, whereas at higher pulse areas, exciton-phonon decoupling preserves the image resolution. Hence, the proposed scheme may open up new possibilities for nanoscale imaging and bioimaging applications using QDs.

Title: Unconventional $s$-Wave Pairing with Point-Node-Like Gap Structure in UTe$_2$
Authors: Shingo Haruna, Takuji Nomura, Hirono Kaneyasu
Abstract: We explore the pairing state and gap structure of UTe$_2$ using a six-orbital model which we call the $f$-$d$-$p$ model. Our model accurately reproduces the quasi-two-dimensional Fermi surfaces consistent with recent de Haas-van Alphen oscillation measurements and the $(0, \pm \pi, 0)$ antiferromagnetic spin fluctuations observed by neutron scattering. We incorporate on-site Coulomb repulsion for $f$ electrons and solve the linearized Eliashberg equation within the third-order perturbation theory to investigate the superconducting symmetry in UTe$_2$. The most likely state is found to be an $s$-wave state with a highly anisotropic superconducting gap structure that exhibits a point-node-like behavior of the specific heat at low temperatures.

Title: Active electron cooling of graphene
Authors: Federico Paolucci, Federica Bianco, Francesco Giazotto, Stefano Roddaro
Abstract: In the emergent field of quantum technology, the ability to manage heat at the nanoscale and in cryogenic conditions is crucial for enhancing device performance in terms of noise, coherence, and sensitivity. Here, we demonstrate the active cooling and refrigeration of the electron gas in a graphene thermal transistor, by taking advantage of nanoscale superconductive tunnel contacts able to pump or extract heat directly from the electrons in the device. Our prototypes achieved a top cooling of electrons in graphene of about 15 mK at a bath temperature of about 450 mK, demonstrating the viability of the proposed device architecture. Our experimental findings are backed by a detailed thermal model that accurately replicated the observed device behavior. Alternative cooling schemes and perspectives are discussed in light of the reported results. Finally, our graphene thermal transistor could find application in superconducting hybrid quantum technologies.

Abstract: We investigate the dissipative spectral form factor (DSFF)--a widely used probe of non-Hermitian quantum chaos--in the elliptic Ginibre unitary ensemble (eGinUE), which interpolates between the non-Hermitian Ginibre unitary ensemble (GinUE) and the Hermitian Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) via a symmetry breaking parameter. We derive exact finite-dimensional results and large-dimensional approximations for the DSFF, revealing a scaling relationship that connects the DSFF of eGinUE to that of GinUE and the spectral form factor of GUE. This relation explains the distinct time scales underlying the characteristic \emph{dip-ramp-plateau} structure across GinUE, GUE, and crossover regimes. Additionally, we refine estimates of dip-ramp and ramp-plateau transition times for different symmetry regimes. We validate our results with Monte Carlo simulations and demonstrate applications to paradigmatic quantum-chaotic systems: the crossover Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and the crossover Power-law Banded random matrices. We highlight an analogy between eGinUE eigenvalues and the positions of a rotating fermionic gas in a two-dimensional anisotropic trap.

Title: Work and Activation in a Nematic Polymer Network Ribbon
Authors: H. Singh, K. Suryanarayanan, E.G. Virga
Abstract: We study spontaneous deformations of a ribbon made of nematic polymer networks and activated under the action of a mechanical load. We show that when such ribbons are activated appropriately, the deformations produced can pull back and perform work against the externally applied load. We perform two numerical experiments to demonstrate this effect: (1) the \emph{pulling} experiment, where the ribbon is pulled longitudinally by a point force, and (2) the \emph{bending} experiment, where the ribbon is bent out of plane by a terminally applied point force. We quantify the capacity of the ribbon to work against external loads, and compute its dependence on both the ribbon thickness and the imprinted nematic texture (that is, the distribution of the nematic directors across the ribbon's length). Finally, we compute the efficiency of the activation process. Building on the outcomes of our numerical explorations, we formulate two educated conjectures on how the activation efficiency can in general be improved by acting on both the applied load and the imprinted nematic texture.

Title: Bilayer Excitons in the Laughlin Fractional Quantum Hall State
Authors: Ron Q. Nguyen, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Navketan Khurana-Batra, Sarah Alkidim, Xiaoxue Liu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, D. E. Feldman, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: The Laughlin state embodies a universal class of fractional quantum Hall effects arising in two-dimensional electron systems subjected to strong perpendicular magnetic fields. Conventionally described by a single-component wavefunction, the Laughlin state features fractionally charged quasiparticles arising from correlations within one electron species. Here, we explore a novel physical situation by introducing inter-species Coulomb coupling between two intra-species Laughlin states in a quantum Hall graphene bilayer structure. Although quasiparticle excitations typically exhibit charge gaps of tens of Kelvin, we observe that this energy scale is significantly lowered through interlayer excitonic pairing between quasiparticles and quasiholes. Identified via transport measurements, these excitons belong to an unprecedented category of charge-neutral anyons, opening a new avenue for investigating exotic quantum statistics and phases of matter.

Title: Algebraic law of local correlations in a driven Rydberg atomic system
Authors: X. Wang, X. F. Wu, B. Yang, B. Zhang, B. Xiong
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism behind the buildup of inner correlations is crucial for studying nonequilibrium dynamics in complex, strongly interacting many-body systems. Here we investigate both analytically and numerically the buildup of antiferromagnetic (AF) correlations in a dynamically tuned Ising model with various geometries, realized in a Rydberg atomic system. Through second-order Magnus expansion (ME), we demonstrate quantitative agreement with numerical simulations for diverse configurations including $2 \times n$ lattice and cyclic lattice with a star. We find that the AF correlation magnitude at fixed Manhattan distance obeys a universal superposition principle: It corresponds to the algebraic sum of contributions from all shortest paths. This superposition law remains robust against variations in path equivalence, lattice geometries, and quench protocols, establishing a new paradigm for correlation propagation in quantum simulators.

Title: Current Fluctuations in One-Dimensional Diffusion-Reaction Systems via Tensor Networks
Authors: Jiayin Gu
Abstract: Tensor networks are employed to characterize the current fluctuations in one-dimensional diffusion-reaction systems. The representative system under study is a semiconducting material where holes and electrons constitute two types of charge carriers. These holes and electrons diffuse in the system with the reactions of pair-generation and -recombination occurring between them. The system is driven by imbalanced conditions imposed at two boundaries. The large deviation function encoding the full counting statistics of electric current is numerically calculated using the density matrix renormalization group. The fluctuation theorem is shown to hold for the current. Moreover, by comparing the cases where the reactions are turned on or off, it is revealed that the reactions have a damping effect on current fluctuations. This indicates an interesting inequality, suggesting that current fluctuations are upper bounded.

Title: Dipole-Mode Spectrum and Hydrodynamic Crossover in a Resonantly Interacting Two-Species Fermion Mixture
Authors: Zhu-Xiong Ye, Alberto Canali, Chun-Kit Wong, Marian Kreyer, Emil Kirilov, Rudolf Grimm
Abstract: Ultracold quantum-gas mixtures of fermionic atoms with resonant control of interactions offer a unique test-bed to explore few- and many-body quantum states with unconventional properties. The emergence of such strongly correlated systems, as for instance symmetry-broken superfluids, is usually accompanied by hydrodynamic collective behavior. Thus, experimental progress in this field naturally requires a deep understanding of hydrodynamic regimes. Here, we report on experiments employing a tunable Fermi-Fermi mixture of $^{161}$Dy and $^{40}$K near quantum degeneracy. We investigate the full spectrum of dipole modes across a Feshbach resonance and characterize the crossover from collisionless to deep hydrodynamic behavior in measurements of frequencies and damping rates. We compare our results with a theoretical model that considers the motion of the mass centers of the two species and we identify the contributions of friction and mean-field interaction. We show that one oscillating mode exists over the whole range of interactions, exhibiting striking changes of frequency and damping in the deep hydrodynamic regime. We observe the second oscillating mode to split into two purely exponential damping modes. One of these exponential modes shows very fast damping, faster than any other relevant timescale, and is largely insensitive against experimental imperfections. It provides an accurate measure for the interspecies drag effect, which generalizes the concept of spin drag explored in other experiments. We characterize the interspecies drag locally in terms of a microscopic friction coefficient and we discuss its unitarity-limited universal behavior on top of the resonance.

Title: Self-consistent tensor network method for correlated super-moiré matter beyond one billion sites
Authors: Yitao Sun, Marcel Niedermeier, Tiago V. C. Antão, Adolfo O. Fumega, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Moiré and super-moiré materials provide exceptional platforms to engineer exotic correlated quantum matter. The vast number of sites required to model moiré systems in real space remains a formidable challenge due to the immense computational resources required. Super-moiré materials push this requirement to the limit, where millions or even billions of sites need to be considered, a requirement beyond the capabilities of conventional methods for interacting systems. Here, we establish a methodology that allows solving correlated states in systems reaching a billion sites, that exploits tensor-network representations of real-space Hamiltonians and self-consistent real-space mean-field equations. Our method combines a tensor-network kernel polynomial method with quantics tensor cross interpolation algorithm, enabling us to solve exponentially large models, including those whose single particle Hamiltonian is too large to be stored explicitly. We demonstrate our methodology with super-moiré systems featuring spatially modulated hoppings, many-body interactions and domain walls, showing that it allows access to self-consistent symmetry broken states and spectral functions of real-space models reaching a billion sites. Our methodology provides a strategy to solve exceptionally large interacting problems, providing a widely applicable strategy to compute correlated super-moiré quantum matter.

Title: Evidence of Momentum Space Condensation in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Erin Morissette, Peiyu Qin, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking provides a powerful window into the nature of underlying electronic orders. In strongly correlated systems, multiple symmetry-breaking orders can arise simultaneously. and their interplay generates an intricate landscape of quantum phases that has remained a central focus of condensed-matter research. In this work, we report a previously unidentified electronic phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, distinguished by the simultaneous breaking of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetries. Broken rotational symmetry is evidenced through anisotropic transport in angle-resolved measurements, while the onset of both the anomalous Hall effect and the nonlinear Hall effect signals the breaking of time-reversal and inversion symmetries. These combined signatures reveal an emergent order consistent with momentum-space condensation, a theoretically anticipated phenomenon realized here experimentally for the first time. This mechanism establishes a natural framework for understanding a broader class of correlated phases known to emerge from the flat bands of two-dimensional materials.

Title: Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relations for Multi-Terminal Systems with Broken Time-Reversal Symmetry
Authors: Yanchao Zhang, Xinzhi Liu, Shanhe Su
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic uncertainty relations (TURs) in steady-state transport for a multi-terminal system consisting of two conducting terminals and N-2 probe terminals, within the linear response regime under broken time-reversal symmetry. We independently derive exact bounds on the TURs for the steady-state particle and heat currents under a strong constraint on the Onsager coefficients. Our analysis reveals that the bounds differ for particle and heat currents and are dependent on the system parameters. Furthermore, we demonstrate that under specific parameter conditions, the TURs of the particle and heat currents have a unified minimum value that depends solely on the number of terminals.

Title: Quasiparticle interference and spectral function of the UTe$_2$ superconductive surface band
Authors: Adeline Crépieux, Emile Pangburn, Shuqiu Wang, Kuanysh Zhussupbekov, Joseph P. Carroll, Bin Hu, Qiangqiang Gu, J.C.Séamus Davis, Catherine Pépin, Cristina Bena
Abstract: We compute the (0-11) surface spectral function, the surface density of states (DOS), and the quasiparticle interference (QPI) patterns, both in the normal state and superconducting (SC) state of UTe$_2$. We consider all possible non-chiral and chiral order parameters (OPs) that could in principle describe the superconductivity in this compound. We describe the formation of surface states whose maximum intensity energy depends on the nature of the pairing. We study also the QPI patterns resulting from the scattering of these surface states. We show that the main feature distinguishing between various OPs is a QPI peak that is only observed experimentally in the superconducting state. The energy dispersion and the stability of this peak is consistent among the non-chiral OPs only with a $B_{3u}$ pairing. Moreover, $B_{3u}$ is the only non-chiral pairing that shows a peak at zero energy in the DOS, consistent with the experimental observations.

Title: Strain and Interface Effects on Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy of MnN
Authors: Robert A. Lawrence, Matt I.J. Probert
Abstract: Thin film effects on the Magnetocrystalline Anisotropy Energy (MAE) of MnN were studied using density functional theory (DFT). Initially, strain effects on bulk MnN were considered as a proxy for lattice-matching induced strain and a linear relationship between the $c/a$ ratio and the MAE was found. A fundamental explanation for this relationship in terms of the underlying point-group symmetry is given, which we show is applicable to all uniaxial magnetic materials. Strain and charge-transfer effects were then considered for an ultra-thin film. It was found that a Ta seed-layer suppresses the net spin moment on the Mn ions, leading to a reduction of the MAE. Charge transfer is shown to be the cause of this, and hence similar effects may be expected at any magnetic heterostructure interface.

Title: Observation of gauge field induced non-Hermitian helical skin effects
Authors: Yu-Hong Han, Yi Li, Jia-Hui Zhang, Yang Kou, Liantuan Xiao, Suotang Jia, Linhu Li, Feng Mei
Abstract: Synthetic gauge fields and non-Hermitian skin effects are pivotal to topological phases and non-Hermitian physics, each recently attracting great interest across diverse research fields. Realizing skin effects typically require nonreciprocal couplings or on-site gain and loss. Here, we theoretically and experimentally report that, under gauge fields, reciprocal dissipative couplings can nontrivially give rise to an unprecedented nonreciprocal skin effect, hosting pseudospin degree of freedom and featuring helical transport, dubbed as the ``helical pseudospin skin effect". Before introducing the gauge fields, this model exhibits localized pseudospin edge modes and extended bulk modes, without skin effects. As the gauge field strength is applied from $0$ to $\pi$, we observe the emergence of two distinct pseudospin skin effects and their topological transitions: the hybrid-order and second-order helical pseudospin skin effects. Our findings not only highlight gauge field enriched non-Hermitian topology, but also brings pseudospin-momentum locking into skin effects.

Title: Engineering frustrated Rydberg spin models by graphical Floquet modulation
Authors: Mingsheng Tian, Rhine Samajdar, Bryce Gadway
Abstract: Arrays of Rydberg atoms interacting via dipole-dipole interactions offer a powerful platform for probing quantum many-body physics. However, these intrinsic interactions also determine and constrain the models -- and parameter regimes thereof -- for quantum simulation. Here, we propose a systematic framework to engineer arbitrary desired long-range interactions in Rydberg-atom lattices, enabling the realization of fully tunable $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg models. Using site-resolved periodic modulation of Rydberg states, we develop an experimentally feasible protocol to precisely control the interaction ratios $J_2/J_1$ and $J_3/J_1$ in a kagome lattice. This control can increase the effective range of interactions and drive transitions between competing spin-ordered and spin liquid phases. To generalize this approach beyond the kagome lattice, we reformulate the design of modulation patterns through a graph-theoretic approach, demonstrating the universality of our method across all 11 planar Archimedean lattices. Our strategy overcomes the inherent constraints of power-law-decaying dipolar interactions, providing a versatile toolbox for exploring frustrated magnetism, emergent topological phases, and quantum correlations in systems with long-range interactions.

Title: Van-Hove singularities and competing instabilities in an altermagnetic metal
Authors: Peng Rao, Johannes Knolle, Laura Classen
Abstract: Van-Hove (VH) singularities in the single-particle band spectrum are important for interaction-driven quantum phases. Whereas VH points are usually spin-degenerate, in newly proposed altermagnets VH singularities can become spin-dependent, due to momentum-dependent spin polarization of the Fermi surfaces arising from combined rotation and time-reversal symmetry. We consider two altermagnetic models ($d_{x^2-y^2}$- and $d_{xy}$-wave) on a square lattice with spin-polarized VH points, and study their stable fixed-point solutions indicating interaction-induced instabilities using parquet renormalization group. For both models, we find new stable fixed-point solutions of the renormalization group equations which are not connected to the solution in the spin-degenerate limit. This implies that on the square lattice, the system with VH singularities is unstable with respect to altermagnetic perturbations. The leading instability for the $d_{x^2-y^2}$-model is real transverse spin density wave. For the $d_{xy}$-wave model, it is found to be real transverse spin density wave at large altermagnetic splitting. At small altermagnetic splitting both imaginary charge density wave and real longitudinal spin density waves are dominant.

Title: Wavefunction-Free Approach for Predicting Nonlinear Responses in Weyl Semimetals

Abstract: By sidestepping the intractable calculations of many-body wavefunctions, density functional theory (DFT) has revolutionized the prediction of ground states of materials. However, predicting nonlinear responses--critical for next-generation quantum devices--still relies heavily on explicit wavefunctions, limiting computational efficiency. In this letter, using the circular photogalvanic effect (CPGE) in Weyl semimetals as a representative example, we realize a 1000-fold computational speedup by eliminating the explicit dependence on wavefunctions. Our approach leverages the one-to-one correspondence between free parameters of Weyl fermions and the associated responses to obtain precise wavefunction-free formulations. Applying our methodology, we systematically investigated known Weyl semimetals and revealed that Ta$_3$S$_2$ exhibits photocurrents an order of magnitude greater than those observed in TaAs, with potential for an additional order-of-magnitude enhancement under strain. To further demonstrate the generality of our approach, we obtained a wavefunction-free formula for the Berry-curvature dipole in Weyl semimetals. Our work paves the way for substantially more efficient screening and optimization of nonlinear electromagnetic properties in topological quantum materials.

Title: Extrinsic contribution to bosonic thermal Hall transport
Authors: Léo Mangeolle, Johannes Knolle
Abstract: Bosonic excitations like phonons and magnons dominate the low-temperature transport of magnetic insulators. Similar to electronic Hall responses, the thermal Hall effect (THE) of charge neutral bosons has been proposed as a powerful tool for probing topological properties of their wavefunctions. For example, the intrinsic contribution of the THE of a perfectly clean system is directly governed by the distribution of Berry curvature, and many experiments on topological magnon and phonon insulators have been interpreted in this way. However, disorder is inevitably present in any material and its contribution to the THE has remained poorly understood. Here we develop a rigorous kinetic theory of the extrinsic side-jump contribution to the THE of bosons. We show that the extrinsic THE can be of the same order as the intrinsic one but sensitively depends on the type of local imperfection. We study different types of impurities and show that a THE can even arise as a pure impurity-induced effect in a system with a vanishing intrinsic contribution. As a side product, we also generalize existing results for the electronic AHE to general types of impurities beyond the standard assumption of local potential scattering. We discuss the importance of our results for the correct interpretation of THE measurements.

Title: Enhanced-Entropy Phases in Geometrically Frustrated Pyrochlore Magnets
Authors: Prakash Timsina, Andres Chappa, Deema Alyones, Igor Vasiliev, Ludi Miao
Abstract: Frustrated magnets provide a platform for exploring exotic phases beyond conventional ordering, with potential relevance to functional materials and information technologies. In this work, we use Monte Carlo simulations to map the thermodynamic phase diagram of pyrochlore iridates R2Ir2O7 (R = Dy, Ho) with three stable magnetic ground-state stable phases: frustrated spin-ice 2 in 2 out (2I2O) phase, frustrated fragmented 3 in 1 out/1 in 3 out (3I1O/1I3O) phase, and antiferromagnetic all in all out (AIAO) phase without frustration. We discovered two additional emergent metastable phases at finite temperatures, located between the boundaries separating those stable phases. These metastable phases exhibit high magnetic susceptibility and high entropy without long-range order. Their stabilization arises from entropic minimization of the free energy, where the entropy dominates energetic competition near phase boundaries at finite temperatures. Our results demonstrate a platform to engineer highly susceptible and degenerated states through frustration and thermal activation, offering a foundation for entropy-based design of metastable phases in correlated systems.

Title: Perpendicularly magnetized Tb/Co multilayers featuring tilted uniaxial anisotropy: Experiments and modeling
Authors: J. C. Rodriguez E., L. Avilés-Félix, M. H. Aguirre, L. M. Rodriguez, D. Salomoni, S. Auffret, R. C. Sousa, I. L. Prejbeanu, A. E. Bruchhausen, E. De Biasi, J. Curiale
Abstract: Rare earth/transition metal (RE/TM) multilayers with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy are key ingredients for the development of spintronic applications. Their compensation temperature depends on the ratio of the thicknesses of rare earth and transition metal, allowing their magnetic properties to be tuned with temperature while maintaining their anisotropy even in nanometer-scale devices. In this work, we performed a thorough structural characterization and systematically investigate the magnetic properties of a whole family of ferrimagnetic [Tb/Co]$_{\times 5}$ multilayers varying the Tb thickness in the range of 0.4 nm - 1.25 nm. A linear dependence of the compensation temperature on the Tb layer thickness was observed. Moreover, a uniaxial anisotropy constant of 330$\pm$30 kJ/m$^3$, which is close to the values reported by other authors, was estimated. Additionally, we proposed a model to gain a better understanding of the angular dependence of the magnetization loops and the linear dependence of the compensation temperature. We present strong evidence demonstrating that the perpendicular anisotropy must be tilted away from the perpendicular axis in order to explain the observed features, particularly the hysteresis in the in-plane loops. Our work advances the understanding of DC magnetic properties in thin RE/TM ferrimagnetic films, which has the potential to impact different fields where these materials are involved.

Title: (2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Sheng-Jie Huang, Apoorv Tiwari, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider "all-boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.

Title: Superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled BaBi$_3$ formed by in situ reduction of bismuthate films
Authors: Shama, Jordan T. McCourt, Merve Baksi, Gleb Finkelstein, Divine P. Kumah
Abstract: Oxygen-scavenging at oxide heterointerfaces has emerged as a powerful route for stabilizing metastable phases that exhibit interesting phenomena, including high-mobility two-dimensional electron gases and high T$_{c}$ superconductivity. We investigate structural and chemical interactions at the heterointerface formed between Al or Eu and the charged-ordered insulator, BaBiO$_3$, leading to emergent superconductivity at 6 K. A combination of X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy measurements shows that oxygen scavenging by the Eu and Al adlayers leads to the formation of superconducting intermetallic BaBi$_3$ in nominal Eu/BaBiO$_3$ and Al/BaBiO$_3$ bilayers. Anisotropic magnetotransport measurements and current-voltage signatures of quasi two-dimensional superconductivity are observed. The mechanisms behind quasi-two-dimensional superconductivity and the role of disorder remain to be clarified. These findings highlight the potential for the use of in situ reduction of bismuthate heterostructures as a platform for stabilizing materials with exotic functional properties. Additionally, the strong spin-orbit coupling at the Bi sites may pave the way for the realization of high T$_{c}$ topological superconductivity.

Title: Observation of entanglement in a cold atom analog of cosmological preheating
Authors: Victor Gondret, Clothilde Lamirault, Rui Dias, Léa Camier, Amaury Micheli, Charlie Leprince, Quentin Marolleau, Jean-René Rullier, Scott Robertson, Denis Boiron, Christoph I. Westbrook
Abstract: We observe entanglement between collective excitations of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a configuration analogous to particle production during the preheating phase of the early universe. In our setup, the oscillation of the inflaton field is mimicked by the transverse breathing mode of a cigar-shaped condensate, which parametrically excites longitudinal quasiparticles with opposite momenta. After a short modulation period, we observe entanglement of these pairs which reveals the role played by vacuum fluctuations in seeding the parametric growth, confirming the quantum origin of the excitations. As the system continues to evolve, we observe a decrease in correlations and a disappearance of non-classical features. These point towards future experimental probes of the late-time nonlinear regime where further analogies can be drawn with reheating, i.e. the thermalization of the post-inflationary Universe.

Title: Spontaneous continuous-symmetry breaking and tower of states in a comb chain
Authors: Jingya Wang, Zenan Liu, Bin-Bin Mao, Xu Tian, Zijian Xiong, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Based on the study of a one-dimensional (1D) antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a comb lattice, this work identifies an example of spontaneous continuous symmetry breaking in a 1D system with short-range interactions. When a symmetry-preserving relevant perturbation is applied to the system, we find that this model can always be described by the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem. The Shen-Qiu-Tian theorem establishes a direct connection between the Marshall-Lieb-Mattis theorem (in the case of bipartite lattices with unequal numbers of sites in the two sublattices) and the breaking of continuous symmetry. Moreover, although previous studies have suggested that the presence of a tower of states (TOS) serves as an important numerical diagnostic of a system's tendency toward spontaneous symmetry breaking, these investigations have primarily focused on 2D systems. In 1D systems, however, the presence of long-range order does not automatically imply the emergence of a TOS. Here, we observe the existence of a TOS in a 1D realistic ferrimagnetic lattice system with short-range interactions.

Title: Dissipation Pathways in a Photosynthetic Complex
Authors: Ignacio Gustin, Chang Woo Kim, Ignacio Franco
Abstract: Determining how energy flows within and between molecules is crucial for understanding chemical reactions, material properties, and even vital processes such as photosynthesis. While the general principles of energy transfer are well established, elucidating the specific molecular pathways by which energy is funneled remains challenging as it requires tracking energy flow in complex molecular environments. Here, we demonstrate how photon excitation energy is partially dissipated in the light-harvesting Fenna-Matthews-Olson (FMO) complex, mediating the excitation energy transfer from light-harvesting chlorosomes to the photosynthetic reaction center in green sulfur bacteria. Specifically, we isolate the contribution of the protein and specific vibrational modes of the pigment molecules to the energy dynamics. For this, we introduce an efficient computational implementation of a recently proposed theory of dissipation pathways for open quantum systems. Using it and a state-of-the-art FMO model with highly structured and chromophore-specific spectral densities, we demonstrate that energy dissipation is dominated by low-frequency modes ($<$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) as their energy range is near-resonance with the energy gaps between electronic states of the pigments. We identify the most important mode for dissipation to be in-plane breathing modes ($\sim$200 cm$^{-1}$) of the bacteriochlorophylls in the complex. Conversely, far-detuned intramolecular vibrations with higher frequencies ($>$ 800 cm$^{-1}$) play no role in dissipation. Interestingly, the FMO complex first needs to borrow energy from the environment to release excess photonic energy, making the energy dissipation dynamics non-monotonic. Beyond their fundamental value, these insights can guide the development of artificial light-harvesting devices and, more broadly, engineer environments for chemical and quantum control tasks.

Title: Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays
Authors: Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Sara Sbernardori, Riccardo Forti, Ralf Klemt, Omar Abdel Karim, Matteo Marinelli, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.

Title: Cluster-diagrammatic D-TRILEX approach to non-local electronic correlations
Authors: Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: In this work, we extend the theoretical approach known as "D-TRILEX", developed for solving correlated electronic systems, to a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the numerically exact quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem, and outperforms significantly more computationally demanding approach based on the parquet approximation. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose the computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.

Title: Instability in Ostwald ripening processes
Authors: Michael Wilkinson
Abstract: There is a dimensionless parameter which enters into the equation for the evolution of supersaturation in Ostwald ripening processes. This parameter is typically a large number. Here it is argued that the consequent stiffness of the equation results in the evolution of the supersaturation being unstable. The instability is evident in numerical simulations of Ostwald ripening.

Title: Band Meandering due to Charged Impurity Effects and Carrier Transport in Ternary Topological Insulators
Authors: Kanav Sharma, Niranjay K R, Infan S Mesh, Radha Krishna Gopal, Chiranjib Mitra
Abstract: Controlling charged impurity disorder is a critical challenge for realizing the promise of topological insulator (TI) surfaces in devices. While doping is often used to tune the chemical potential, its impact on the fundamental disorder landscape remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate this effect in ternary (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ (BST) thin films and their indium-doped (IBST) counterparts. Gate-dependent transport reveals that indium doping increases charged impurity density by an order of magnitude, which in turn reduces the characteristic size of disorder-induced charge puddles from $\sim$91 nm to $\sim$38 nm. This amplified disorder enhances Coulomb scattering and suppresses field-effect mobility, directly demonstrating how doping-induced compensation degrades surface transport. Our work establishes doping as a powerful method to probe the limits of topological protection and underscores that defect suppression, not just compensation, is essential for developing high-performance TI devices.

Title: Description using equilibrium temperature in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics employing the conventional expectation value
Authors: Masamichi Ishihara
Abstract: We studied the thermodynamic quantities and the probability distribution, expressing the probability distribution as a function of the energy, in the canonical ensemble within the framework of the Tsallis statistics, which is characterized by the entropic parameter $q$, employing the conventional expectation value (the linear average). We treated the power-law-like distribution. The equilibrium temperature, which is often called the physical temperature, was employed, and the probability distribution described with the equilibrium temperature was derived. The Tsallis statistics represented by the equilibrium temperature was applied to $N$ harmonic oscillators, where $N$ is the number of the oscillators. The expressions of the energy, the Tsallis entropy, and the heat capacity were obtained. The expressions of these quantities and the expression of the probability distribution were obtained when the differences between adjacent energy levels are the same. These quantities and the distributions were numerically calculated. The $q$ dependences of the energy, the Rényi entropy, and the heat capacity are weak. In contrast, the Tsallis entropy depends on $q$. The probability distribution as a function of the energy depends on $N$ and $q$. The results provide a basis for describing power-law-like phenomena in the Tsallis statistics. The present formulation is expected to apply to various phenomena, because the harmonic oscillator plays a fundamental role in describing classical and quantum systems.

Title: Spin Faraday pattern formation in a circular spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensate with stripe phase
Authors: Shixiang Chen, Hongguang Liang, Juan Wang, Yan Li
Abstract: We investigate the spin Faraday pattern formation in a periodically driven, pancake-shaped spin-orbit-coupled (SOC) Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) prepared with stripe phase. By modulating atomic interactions using in-phase and out-of-phase protocols, we observe collective excitation modes with distinct rotational symmetries (L-fold). Crucially, at the critical modulation frequency, out-of-phase modulation destabilizes the L = 6 pattern, whereas in-phase modulation not only preserves high symmetry but also excites higher-order modes. Unlike conventional binary BECs, Faraday patterns emerge here without initial noise due to SOC-induced symmetry breaking, with all patterns exhibiting supersolid characteristics. Furthermore, we demonstrate control over pattern symmetry, radial nodes, and pattern radius by tuning the modulation frequency, providing a new approach for manipulating quantum fluid dynamics. This work establishes a platform for exploring supersolidity and nonlinear excitations in SOC systems with stripe phase.

Title: Solute segregation-induced activation of grain boundary disconnections
Authors: Zuoyong Zhang, Chuang Deng
Abstract: Disconnections, long recognized as the key mediators of grain boundary (GB) kinetics in polycrystalline materials, have traditionally been understood to nucleate through thermal or mechanical activation. In this work, using atomistic simulations, we reveal a distinct nucleation mechanism driven exclusively by solute interstitial segregation across multiple substitutional binary alloy systems (e.g., Al-Ni, Al-Fe). This process exhibits a zero-nucleation energy barrier, contrasting sharply with the nucleation mechanisms in pure systems. We identify two segregation-induced disconnection types: (i) annihilable disconnections that promote GB migration and annihilate with continuous segregation, and (ii) permanent disconnections that form stable dipoles, which are mechanically robust, suppressing shear-coupled migration and instead resulting in GB amorphization and pure sliding under applied shear loading. The long-range stress fields associated with these permanent disconnections further attract solute atoms and assist the nucleation of precipitates. These solute segregation-activated disconnections, absent in pure materials, follow unique nucleation pathways as confirmed through dichromatic pattern analysis and persist across different alloy chemistries and crystal structures. Our findings demonstrate that solute interstitial segregation provides a powerful and previously unrecognized pathway for barrier-free disconnection formation, thereby fundamentally extending current understanding of GB kinetics in alloy systems.

Title: Dual effect of cholesterol on interfacial water dynamics in lipid membranes: Interplay between membrane packing and hydration
Authors: Kokoro Shikata, Kento Kasahara, Nozomi Morishita Watanabe, Hiroshi Umakoshi, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: Water contained within biological membranes plays a critical role in maintaining the separation between intracellular and extracellular environments and facilitating biochemical processes. Variations in membrane composition and temperature lead to phase state changes in lipid membranes, which in turn influence the structure and dynamics of the associated interfacial water. In this study, molecular dynamics simulations were performed on binary membranes composed of dipalmitoylphosphatidylcholine (DPPC) or palmitoyl sphingomyelin (PSM) mixed with cholesterol (Chol). To elucidate the effects of Chol on interfacial water, we examined the orientation and hydrogen-bonding behavior of water molecules spanning from the membrane interior to the interface. As the Chol concentration increased, a transient slow down in water dynamics was observed in the ripple phase at 303 K. Conversely, at higher Chol concentrations, water dynamics were accelerated relative to pure lipid membranes across all temperatures studied. Specifically, at a Chol concentration of 50%, the hydrogen bond lifetime in DPPC membranes decreased to approximately 0.5-0.7 times that of pure lipid membranes. This nonmonotonic behavior is attributed to the combined effects of membrane packing induced by Chol and a reduced density of lipid molecules in the hydrophilic region, offering key insights for modulating the dynamical properties of interfacial water.

Title: Anomalous Doppler effect in two-component Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Tomasz Zawiślak, Sandro Stringari, Alessio Recati
Abstract: We show that two-component Bose-Einstein condensed mixtures, in presence of a persistent current, exhibit a non trivial Doppler shift of the sound velocities. The peculiarity is due to the inter-species interaction and the possibility of generating a counter-flow persistent current. Analytic predictions are derived by using superfluid hydrodynamics. While the existence of anomalous Doppler shifts at finite temperature has been discussed a long time ago in the case of superfluid Helium-4, an experimental verification of the effect is still missing. For this reason, we also propose a protocol for the measurement of the Doppler shifts, based on the density-density response function. The dynamical protocol is simulated by means of coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations.

Title: Continuous topological phase transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases
Authors: Qi Zhang, Wen-Tao Xu
Abstract: Topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation remain poorly understood. A notable example is the transition between the toric code (TC) and double semion (DS) phases, which has two distinct $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders in (2 + 1)D. Previous studies reveal that the transition between them can be either first order or via an intermediate phase, thus the existence of a directly continuous transition between them remains a long-standing problem. Motivated by the fact that both phases can arise from condensing distinct anyons in the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ topological order, we introduce a perturbed $\mathbb{Z}_4$ quantum double (QD) model to study the TC-DS transition. We confirm the existence of a continuous (2 + 1)D XY* transition between the TC and DS phases by mapping it to a two-coupled quantum Ising model. Importantly, using the condensation order parameters and the area law coefficients of the Wilson loops, we further reveal that $\mathbb{Z}_4$ anyons, fractionalized from the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological orders, become deconfined at the transition between $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topologically ordered phases. Our results open a path toward developing a theoretical framework for topological phase transitions beyond anyon condensation.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensate sub-wavelength confinement via superoscillations
Authors: Dusty R. Lindberg, Gerard McCaul, Peisong Peng, Lev Kaplan, Diyar Talbayev, Denys I. Bondar
Abstract: Optical lattices are essential tools in ultra-cold atomic physics. Here we demonstrate theoretically that sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved in these lattices through superoscillations. This generic wave phenomenon occurs when a local region of the wave oscillates faster than any of the frequencies in its global Fourier decomposition. To illustrate how sub-wavelength confinement can be achieved via superoscillations, we consider a one-dimensional tri-chromatic optical potential confining a spinless Bose-Einstein Condensate of $^{87}$Rb atoms. By numerical optimization of the relative phases and amplitudes of the optical trap's frequency components, it is possible to generate superoscillatory spatial regions. Such regions contain multiple density peaks at sub-wavelength spacing. This work establishes superoscillations as a viable route to sub-wavelength BEC confinement in blue-detuned optical lattices.

Title: Fractal depth-first search paths in statistical physics models
Authors: Qiyuan Shi, Youjin Deng, Ming Li
Abstract: We study the fractal properties of depth-first search (DFS) paths in critical configurations of statistical physics models, including the two-dimensional $O(n)$ loop model for various $n$, and bond percolation in dimensions $d = 2$ to $6$. In the $O(n)$ loop model, across both critical and tricritical Potts regimes, the fractal dimension of the DFS path consistently follows $d_{\rm DFS} = 1 + g/8$, where $g$ is the coupling constant in Coulomb gas theory, related to $n$ via $n^2 = 2 + 2 \cos(\pi g/2)$ with $g \in [8/3, 16/3]$. For bond percolation, the DFS path exhibits nontrivial fractal scaling across all studied dimensions. Interestingly, when DFS is applied to the full lattice without any dilution or criticality, the path is still fractal in two dimensions, with a dimension close to $7/4$, but becomes space-filling in higher dimensions. Our results demonstrate that DFS offers a robust and broadly applicable geometric probe for exploring critical phenomena beyond traditional observables.

Title: Multiple crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle
Authors: Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The relaxation time was found to depend on the strength of anisotropy.

Title: Tunneling spectroscopy of the spinon-Kondo effect in one-dimensional Mott insulators
Authors: Rodrigo G. Pereira, Bruno F. Marquez, Karen Hallberg, Tim Bauer, Reinhold Egger
Abstract: We study the tunneling density of states (TDOS) in one-dimensional Mott insulators at energies below the charge gap. By employing nonlinear Luttinger liquid theory and density-matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we predict that in the presence of a magnetic impurity at the boundary, characteristic Fermi-edge singularity features can appear at subgap energies in the TDOS near the boundary. In contrast to the Kondo effect in a metal, these resonances are strongly asymmetric and of power-law form. The power-law exponent is universal and determined by the spinon-Kondo effect.

Title: Universal properties and dynamical bosonization of strongly interacting one-dimensional anyons
Authors: Ovidiu I. Patu
Abstract: We study a one-dimensional system of strongly interacting anyons with short-range interactions under external confinement. This system, referred to as $p$-wave anyons, interpolates continuously between spin-polarized fermions with $p$-wave interactions and free bosons. At zero temperature, the correlation functions decay exponentially with distance, with oscillations governed by the statistics parameter. The decay rate is maximal for $p$-wave fermions and decreases monotonically as the statistics parameter approaches the bosonic limit, where it vanishes. The momentum distribution is asymmetric, a hallmark of one-dimensional anyons, and takes the form of a shifted Lorentzian with universal power-law tails, $\lim_{k \to \pm \infty} n(k)\sim C/k^2$. We prove analytically that, following release from a harmonic trap, the asymptotic momentum distribution converges to that of free bosons in the same trap, a phenomenon known as dynamical bosonization. We also establish the universality of the groundstate $n$-particle reduced density matrices: their natural occupations are independent of the confining potential, while the associated natural $n$-functions for different confinements are related through a simple analytical transformation. In particular, for the one-particle reduced density matrix, we derive exact expressions for both the natural occupations and the natural orbitals at arbitrary particle number. These results extend and unify earlier partial findings for $p$-wave fermions, and they provide a clear conceptual explanation of the double degeneracy observed in their spectrum.

Title: Ultrafast Dynamics of Spin-Orbit Entangled Excitons Coupled to Magnetic Ordering in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3
Authors: Sidhanta Sahu, Anupama Chauhan, Poulami Ghosh, Sayan Routh, Ruturaj Puranik, Setti Thirupathaiah, Siddhartha Lal, Shriganesh Prabhu S, Chiranjib Mitra, N. Kamaraju
Abstract: Spin-orbit entangled excitons (SOEE) in two-dimensional (2D) antiferromagnets provide direct access to explore unconventional many body interactions in correlated electron systems. In this work, we carry out a detailed investigation using non-degenerate isotropic and anisotropic pump-probe reflection spectroscopy to probe the ultrafast dynamics of SOEE and their coupling to spin fluctuations in NiPS3. Transient reflectivity data reveals acoustic phonon oscillations at ~ 27 GHz, along with two distinct relaxation timescales: fast (1-9 ps) and slower components (1-4 ns) associated with SOEE coherence and spin reordering, respectively. Both timescales exhibit pronounced temperature dependence near the exciton dissociation (TED = 120 K) and Neel (TN = 155 K) temperatures. The SOEE coherence shortens from ~ 8-9 ps at T < TED to ~ 3 ps at T > TED with a finite tail persisting beyond TN. The spin reordering time grows near 120 K, and shows critical slowing down around TN. Pump fluence studies further corroborate their spin origin. Our findings uncover the direct interplay between the excitonic and spin degrees of freedom across ultrafast and longer timescales, offering new opportunities to probe and engineer emergent many-body interactions in 2D antiferromagnets.

Title: Quenched disorder and the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model
Authors: M. Iskin
Abstract: We study the impact of weak quenched disorder on the BCS-BEC crossover in the Hubbard model within a functional-integral approach. By deriving the thermodynamic potential up to second order in both the disorder potential and pairing fluctuations, we obtain self-consistent expressions for the number equation, condensate fraction, superfluid fraction and sound speed at zero temperature. In the dilute BEC limit, our results analytically reproduce the known continuum limits of weakly-interacting bosons, where weak disorder depletes the superfluid more strongly than the condensate due to broken translational symmetry, and enhances the sound speed through the overcompensation of the static compressibility. These findings establish a unified and controlled approach for describing the BCS-BEC crossover in disordered lattice models, and they provide a foundation for future extensions to finite temperatures and multiband Hubbard models.

Title: Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)
Authors: Zoë J. Gray, Joseph B. Choi, Youngsoo Choi, H. Keo Springer, H. S. Udaykumar, Stephen S. Baek
Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.

Title: Selective bulk-boundary correspondence in higher-order topological insulators with anticommuting mirror and chiral symmetries
Authors: Suman Aich, Babak Seradjeh (IUB)
Abstract: We investigate higher-order topological insulators protected by chiral and anticommuting mirror symmetries. Using models in the BDI class, which include the prototypical topological quadrupole insulator, we show that breaking mirror symmetries that anticommute with the chiral operator leads to edge-selective bulk-boundary correspondence, with gap closings and bound states appearing only along a subset of boundaries of the same orientation and codimension. We define a new edge-sensitive topological invariant that distinguishes this mechanism from previous reports of non-topological edge-selection effects.

Title: Detecting quantum spin liquid on Kitaev model through a superconducting junction
Authors: A. R. Moura, L. V. Santos
Abstract: The Kitaev model belongs to an unconventional class of two-dimensional spin systems characterized by anisotropic, bond-dependent interactions that give rise to Quantum Spin Liquid (QSL) states. These exotic phases, marked by the absence of magnetic ordering even at zero temperature, support fractionalized excitations and emergent gauge fields. A particularly compelling feature of the Kitaev model is its exact solvability, which reveals low-energy excitations in the form of itinerant Majorana fermions-quasiparticles that obey non-Abelian statistics and are of central interest in topological quantum computation due to their inherent robustness against local perturbations and decoherence. Despite extensive theoretical advancements, the experimental identification of QSLs remains challenging, as conventional magnetic probes fail to detect their defining properties. In this work, we present a theoretical investigation of spin current injection from a superconducting metal into a Kitaev quantum spin liquid. By employing a spintronic framework, we derive the dynamics of the injected spin current and demonstrate how its signatures can be traced back to the underlying Majorana excitations in the spin liquid phase. Superconductivity plays a pivotal role in this context, not only as a source of coherent quasiparticles but also as a platform with potential for interfacing with topological quantum devices. Our analysis contrasts the Kitaev-superconductor interface with conventional ferromagnetic junctions, where spin transport is carried by magnons, and highlights distinctive features in the spin current response. These findings open new directions for the detection of QSLs and contribute to the broader effort of integrating topological quantum materials into scalable quantum technologies.

Title: Stochastic gyration driven by dichotomous noises
Authors: Timothée Herbeau, Leonid Pastur, Pascal Viot, Gleb Oshanin
Abstract: We consider stochastic dynamics of a particle on a plane in presence of two noises and a confining parabolic potential - an analog of the experimentally-relevant Brownian Gyrator (BG) model. In contrast to the standard BG model, we suppose here that the time-evolution of the position components is driven not by Gaussian white-noises, but by two statistically-independent dichotomous noises. We calculate analytically the position variances and cross-correlations, as well as the mean angular momentum, which permits us to establish the conditions in which a spontaneous rotational motion of the particle around the origin takes place. We also present a numerical analysis of the mean angular velocity. Lastly, we calculate analytically some marginal position probability density functions revealing a remarkably rich behavior that emerges in such a system of two coupled linear stochastic differential equations. We show that depending on the values of parameters characterizing noises these distributions approach the steady-state forms defined on a finite support, having very unusual shapes, possessing multiple maxima and minima, plateaus and exhibiting a discontinuous behavior.

Title: Phase Separation in Kitaev Chain
Authors: Kazuhiro Kuboki
Abstract: Kitaev chain is a one-dimensional spinless fermion model that has $p$-wave superconducting (SC) states and Majorana zero modes at the edge. Usually this model is analyzed by taking only SC order parameter (OP) into account, but the situation significantly changes when OPs other than the SCOP are included. It turns out that the SC state in the latter case is prone to phase separation for moderate to strong attractiive interactions.

Title: Machine-Learning-Guided Insights into Solid-Electrolyte Interphase Conductivity: Are Amorphous Lithium Fluorophosphates the Key?
Authors: Peichen Zhong, Kristin A. Persson
Abstract: Despite decades of study, the identity of the dominant \ce{Li+}-conducting phase within the inorganic SEI of Li-ion batteries remains unresolved. While the mosaic model describes LiF/\ce{Li2O}/\ce{Li2CO3} nanocrystallites within a disordered matrix, these crystalline phases inherently offer limited ionic conductivity. Growing evidence suggests that interfaces, grain boundaries, and amorphous phases may instead host the primary fast-ion pathways. Using diffusion-based generative structure prediction and machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), we investigate lithium difluorophosphate (\ce{LiPO2F2}), a key mixed-anion decomposition product of phosphorus- and fluorine-containing electrolytes. We identify a stable crystalline polymorph and demonstrate that the amorphous counterpart is conductive, with projected room-temperature $\sigma \approx 0.18$ mS cm$^{-1}$ and $E_\mathrm{a} \approx 0.40$ eV. This enhancement stems from structural disorder flattening the Li site-energy landscape and a low formation energy for Li-interstitial defects, which supplies additional mobile carriers. We propose amorphous mixed-anion Li--P--O--F phases as a promising conducting medium in the SEI, offering a specific target for engineering improved battery interfaces.

Title: AQCat25: Unlocking spin-aware, high-fidelity machine learning potentials for heterogeneous catalysis

Abstract: Large-scale datasets have enabled highly accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) for general-purpose heterogeneous catalysis modeling. There are, however, some limitations in what can be treated with these potentials because of gaps in the underlying training data. To extend these capabilities, we introduce AQCat25, a complementary dataset of 13.5 million density functional theory (DFT) single point calculations designed to improve the treatment of systems where spin polarization and/or higher fidelity are critical. We also investigate methodologies for integrating new datasets, such as AQCat25, with the broader Open Catalyst 2020 (OC20) dataset to create spin-aware models without sacrificing generalizability. We find that directly tuning a general model on AQCat25 leads to catastrophic forgetting of the original dataset's knowledge. Conversely, joint training strategies prove effective for improving accuracy on the new data without sacrificing general performance. This joint approach introduces a challenge, as the model must learn from a dataset containing both mixed-fidelity calculations and mixed-physics (spin-polarized vs. unpolarized). We show that explicitly conditioning the model on this system-specific metadata, for example by using Feature-wise Linear Modulation (FiLM), successfully addresses this challenge and further enhances model accuracy. Ultimately, our work establishes an effective protocol for bridging DFT fidelity domains to advance the predictive power of foundational models in catalysis.

Title: Terahertz Time-Domain Spectroscopy and Density Functional Theory Analysis of Low-Frequency Vibrational Modes of a Benzoxazolium-Coumarin Donor-pi-Acceptor Chromophore
Authors: Sidhanta Sahu, Phalguna Krishna Das Vana, Anupama Chauhan, Poulami Ghosh, Vijay Sai Krishna Cheerala, Sanyam, C. N. Sundaresan, N. Kamaraju
Abstract: To elucidate low-frequency vibrational modes, we investigate a benzoxazolium--coumarin (BCO+) donor-pi-acceptor derivative using transmission terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS). The retrieved complex refractive index reveals distinct modes at 0.62, 0.85, 1.30, 1.81, and 2.07 THz. Gas-phase density functional theory (DFT) agrees well with these features and enables assignment of specific intramolecular motions. Together, THz-TDS and DFT identify the characteristic low-frequency modes of BCO+ and suggest their connection to intramolecular charge transfer-relevant nuclear motions, highlighting that THz-TDS can serve as a sensitive probe of vibrational signatures in donor-pi-acceptor systems.

Title: Electrical conductivity of randomly placed linear wires: a mean field approach
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov, Irina V. Vodolazskaya
Abstract: Using the mean-field approximation, a formula for the effective electrical conductivity of a two-dimensional system of randomly arranged conducting sticks with a given orientation distribution was obtained. Both the resistance of the sticks themselves and the resistance of the contacts between them were taken into account. The accuracy in the resulting formula was analyzed. A comparison of the theoretical predictions of mean-field approach with the results of direct electrical conductivity calculations for several model orientation distributions describing systems with crossed sticks demonstrated good agreement. Our study showed that cross-alignment of nanowires should lead to a decreasing in the electrical conductivity compared to electrodes with isotropically arranged nanowires. We suppose that the widely used model with zero-width sticks is quite acceptable for systems of cross-aligned nanowires, but overestimates their connectivity in isotropic systems. Thus, the enhancement of the electrical conductivity of conducting films with cross-aligned nanowires may be due to a significant difference in the network topology.

Title: Discontinuous transition in explosive percolation via local suppression
Authors: Young Sul Cho
Abstract: We study an explosive percolation model in which a link is randomly added and neighboring nodes sequentially rewire their links to suppress the growth of large clusters. In this manner, the rewiring nodes spread outward starting from the initial node closest to the added link. We show that a discontinuous transition emerges even when the total number of rewiring nodes after each link addition is finite. This finding implies that adding a link using the information of the cluster sizes attached to a finite set of link candidates (local information) can lead to a discontinuous transition if link rewiring is allowed. This result thus extends the previous result that a discontinuous transition arises only when a link is added using the information of the cluster sizes attached to an infinite number of link candidates (global information) in the absence of rewiring.

Title: Projected Density Matrix Sampling for Lattice Hamiltonians
Authors: Abhishek Karna, Hansen S. Wu, Shailesh Chandrasekharan, Ribhu K. Kaul
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo methods are powerful tools for studying quantum many-body systems but face difficulties in accessing excited states and in treating sign problems. We present a continuous-time path-integral Monte Carlo method for computing the low-lying spectrum of generic quantum Hamiltonians within a projection subspace. The method projects the thermal density matrix onto a subspace spanned by a chosen set of linearly independent states. It is free of Trotter discretization errors and systematically converges to the low-energy states which have finite overlap with the projection subspace as the $\beta$ parameter increases. While most effective for systems without a sign problem, the method also yields information about low-energy spectra when sign problems are present. We illustrate the approach on two problems. For the sign-free case, we compute the first four low-energy levels in the scaling limit of the one-dimensional Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, demonstrating the flow from the conformal limit to the massive $E_8$ quantum field theory. For the sign-problem case, we apply the method to the frustrated Shastry-Sutherland model and benchmark it against exact diagonalization on small lattices. We also present results for larger systems beyond the lattice sizes accessible to exact diagonalization, while limited to small $\beta$ where sign problems occur. Our method provides a general route toward quantum Monte Carlo spectroscopy for lattice Hamiltonians.

Title: Robust coherent phonon mode localized at GaP/Si(001) heterointerface
Authors: Kunie Ishioka, Gerson Mette, Steven Youngkin, Andreas Beyer, Wolfgang Stolz, Kerstin Volz, Christopher J. Stanton, Ulrich Höfer
Abstract: Ultrafast electron and phonon dynamics at a buried interface of GaP/Si(001) are investigated at different growth stages of the GaP layer by combining interface-specific photoexcitation and transient reflectivity detection. A discrete electronic state, which dominates the charge carrier dynamics at the interface of a thin low-temperature nucleation layer, is found to be quenched by the following high-temperature overgrowth. A coherent phonon mode localized at the heterointerface is observed for both the thin nucleation layers and the thicker overgrown layers, and their amplitude exhibits the similar resonance behavior to that of the interface electronic transition at the respective growth stages. The optical polarization-dependence of the phonon amplitude is nearly isotropic for the nucleation layer but becomes anisotropic after the overgrowth, possibly due to the formation of an intermixing layer. Our observations imply that the 2-THz phonon mode itself is robust against the high-temperature overgrowth, but its amplitude is defined by the coupling with the interface electronic transition that is more sensitively affected by the overgrowth.

Title: Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops
Authors: Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.

Title: High-Precision Simulations of the Parity Conserving Directed Percolation Universality Class in 1+1 Dimensions
Authors: Peter Grassberger
Abstract: Next to the directed percolation (DP) universality class, parity conserving directed percolation (pcDP; also called parity conserving branching annihilating random walks, pcBARW) is the second-most important model with an absorbing state transition. Its distinction from ordinary DP is that particle number is conserved modulo 2, which implies that there are two distinct sectors in systems with a finite initial number of particles: Realizations with even and odd particle numbers show different scaling behaviors, and systems in the odd sector cannot die. An intriguing feature of pcDP it is that some of its critical exponents seem to be very simple rational numbers. The most prominent is the one describing the average number of particles (or active sites) in the even sector, which is asymptotically constant. In contrast, the dynamical critical exponent (which is the same in both sectors) seems not close to any simple rational. Finally, the order parameter exponent $\beta$ (which is also the same in both sectors) is, according to the most precise previous simulations, rather close to 1, but incompatible with it. We present high statistics simulations which clarify this situation, and which indicate several other intriguing properties of pcPD clusters. In particular, we find that all exponents which were close to rationals are even closer, and $\beta = 1.000$ with the error in the next digit.

Title: Transverse response from anisotropic Fermi surfaces
Authors: Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We demonstrate that an anisotropic and rotated Fermi surface can generate a finite transverse response in electron transport, even in the absence of a magnetic field or Berry curvature. Using a two-dimensional continuum model, we show that broken $k_y \to -k_y$ symmetry inherent to anistropic bandstructures leads to a nonzero transverse conductivity. We construct a lattice model with direction-dependent nearest- and next-nearest-neighbor hoppings that faithfully reproduces the continuum dispersion and allows controlled rotation of the Fermi contour. Employing a multiterminal geometry and the Büttiker-probe method, we compute the resulting transverse voltage and establish its direct correspondence with the continuum transverse response. The effect increases with the degree of anisotropy and vanishes at rotation angles where mirror symmetry is restored. Unlike the quantum Hall effect, the transverse response predicted here is not quantized but varies continuously with the band-structure parameters. Our results provide a symmetry-based route to engineer transverse signals in low-symmetry materials without magnetic fields or topological effects.

Title: Quenching dynamics of vortex in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Juan Wang, Zhenze Fan, Yan Li
Abstract: We investigate the ground states and rich dynamics of vortices in spin-orbit coupled Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) subject to position-dependent detuning. Such a detuning plays the role of an effective rotational frequency, causing the generation of a synthetic magnetic field. Through scanning the detuning gradient, we numerically obtain static vortex lattice structures containing 1 to 6 vortices using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. When quenching detuning gradient below its initial value, the vortex lattices exhibit interesting periodic rotation motion, and their dynamical stability can persist for up to 1000ms. In particular, depending on the detuning gradient, the twin vortices exhibit either a scissors-like rotational oscillation or a clockwise periodic rotation, reflecting the response to the magnetic field gradient experienced by the condensates. We fit the numerical results to quantitatively analyze the relation between rotation dynamics and magnetic field gradients. When quenching the detuning gradient beyond its initial value, additional vortices appear. Our findings may motivate further experimental studies of vortex dynamics in synthetic magnetic fields and offer insights for engineering a BEC-based magnetic field gradiometer.

Title: A Unified Symmetry Classification of Magnetic Orders via Spin Space Groups: Prediction of Coplanar Even-Wave Phases
Authors: Ziyin Song, Ziyue Qi, Chen Fang, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng
Abstract: Spin space groups (SSGs) impose fundamentally different constraints on magnetic configurations in real and reciprocal spaces. As a consequence, the correspondence between real-space and momentum-space spin arrangements is far richer than traditionally assumed. Building on the complete enumeration of SSGs, we develop a systematic, symmetry-based framework that classifies all possible spin arrangements allowed by these groups. This unified approach naturally incorporates conventional magnetic orders, altermagnetism, and p-wave magnetism as distinct symmetry classes. Crucially, our classification predicts a variety of novel magnetic phases, highlighted by the discovery of the coplanar even-wave magnet: a state that is non-collinear in real space but hosts a collinear even-wave spin polarization in k-space. Analysis of a minimal model reveals that this phase is characterized by non-quantized spin polarization and exhibits a novel mechanism for symmetry-enforced zero polarization on non-degenerate bands. Extending the framework from bulk crystals to layer SSGs appropriate for two-dimensional systems, we further predict layered counterparts and provide symmetry guidelines for designing bilayer coplanar p-wave and even-wave magnets. We further validate this finding through first-principles calculations and propose CoCrO4 as a promising candidate for its experimental realization, thereby demonstrating the completeness and predictive power of the SSG-based classification of magnetic orders.

Title: Nonreciprocal Bistability in Coupled Nonlinear Cavity Magnonics
Authors: Wei Xiong, Yuan Gong, Zhuanxia Li, Ying-Xia Wu, Yan-Xue Cheng, Jiaojiao Chen
Abstract: We propose a coupled nonlinear cavity-magnon system, consisting of two cavities, a second-order nonlinear element, and a yttrium-iron-garnet (YIG) sphere that supports Kerr magnons, to realize the sought-after highly tunable nonreciprocity. We first derive the critical condition for switching between reciprocity and nonreciprocity in the absence of magnon driving, and then numerically demonstrate that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can be achieved by violating this critical condition. When magnons are driven, we show that strong magnonic nonreciprocity can also be attained even within the critical condition. Compared to previous studies, the introduced nonlinear element not only relaxes the critical condition in both the weak and strong coupling regimes, but also offers an alternative means to tune magnonic nonreciprocity. Our work provides a promising avenue for realizing highly tunable nonreciprocal devices based on Kerr magnons.

Authors: Hans J. Haubold, Arak M. Mathai
Abstract: The paper utilizes data from the SuperKamiokande solar neutrino detection experiment and analyzes them by diffusion entropy analysis and standard deviation analysis to evaluate the scaling exponent of the probability density function. The result indicates that solar neutrinos are subject to Levy flights. Subsequently, the paper derives the probability density function, represented as the Fox H-function, and the governing fractional diffusion equation for solar neutrino Levy flights.

Title: Instanton Density Operator in Lattice QCD from Higher Category Theory
Authors: Jing-Yuan Chen
Abstract: A natural definition for instanton density operator in lattice QCD has long been desired. We show this problem is, and has to be, solved by higher category theory. The problem is solved by refining at a conceptual level the Yang-Mills theory on lattice, in order to recover the homotopy information in the continuum, which would have been lost if we put the theory on lattice in the traditional way. The refinement needed is a generalization--through the lens of higher category theory--of the familiar process of Villainization that captures winding in lattice XY model and Dirac quantization in lattice Maxwell theory. The apparent difference is that Villainization is in the end described by principal bundles, hence familiar, but more general topological operators can only be captured on the lattice by more flexible structures beyond the usual group theory and fibre bundles, making the language of categories natural and necessary. The key structure we need for our particular problem is called multiplicative bundle gerbe, based upon which we can construct suitable structures to naturally define the 2d Wess-Zumino-Witten term, 3d skyrmion density operator and 4d hedgehog defect for lattice $S^3$ pion vacua non-linear sigma model, and the 3d Chern-Simons term, 4d instanton density operator and 5d Yang monopole defect for lattice $SU(N)$ Yang-Mills theory; the structures behind the non-linear sigma model and the Yang-Mills theory are related via an implicit Yang-Baxter equation. In a broader perspective, higher category theory enables us to rethink more systematically the relation between continuum quantum field theory and lattice quantum field theory. We sketch a proposal towards a general machinery that constructs the suitably refined lattice degrees of freedom for a given non-linear sigma model or gauge theory in the continuum, realizing the desired topological operators on the lattice.

Title: Colloquium: Synthetic quantum matter in non-standard geometries
Authors: Tobias Grass, Dario Bercioux, Utso Bhattacharya, Maciej Lewenstein, Hai Son Nguyen, Christof Weitenberg
Abstract: Quantum simulation is making a significant impact on scientific research. The prevailing tendency of the field is to build quantum simulators that get closer to real-world systems of interest, in particular electronic materials. However, progress in the microscopic design also provides an opportunity for an orthogonal research direction: building quantum many-body systems beyond real-world limitations. This colloquium takes this perspective: Concentrating on synthetic quantum matter in non-standard lattice geometries, such as fractal lattices or quasicrystals, higher-dimensional or curved spaces, it aims at providing a fresh introduction to the field of quantum simulation aligned with recent trends across various quantum simulation platforms, including atomic, photonic, and electronic devices. We also shine light on the novel phenomena which arise from these geometries: Condensed matter physicists may appreciate the variety of different localization properties as well as novel topological phases which are offered by such exotic quantum simulators. But also in the search of quantum models for gravity and cosmology, quantum simulators of curved spaces can provide a useful experimental tool.

Title: Strict universality of the square-root law in price impact across stocks: a complete survey of the Tokyo stock exchange
Authors: Yuki Sato, Kiyoshi Kanazawa
Abstract: Universal power laws have been scrutinised in physics and beyond, and a long-standing debate exists in econophysics regarding the strict universality of the nonlinear price impact, commonly referred to as the square-root law (SRL). The SRL posits that the average price impact $I$ follows a power law with respect to transaction volume $Q$, such that $I(Q) \propto Q^{\delta}$ with $\delta \approx 1/2$. Some researchers argue that the exponent $\delta$ should be system-specific, without universality. Conversely, others contend that $\delta$ should be exactly $1/2$ for all stocks across all countries, implying universality. However, resolving this debate requires high-precision measurements of $\delta$ with errors of around $0.1$ across hundreds of stocks, which has been extremely challenging due to the scarcity of large microscopic datasets -- those that enable tracking the trading behaviour of all individual accounts. Here we conclusively support the universality hypothesis of the SRL by a complete survey of all trading accounts for all liquid stocks on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE) over eight years. Using this comprehensive microscopic dataset, we show that the exponent $\delta$ is equal to $1/2$ within statistical errors at both the individual stock level and the individual trader level. Additionally, we rejected two prominent models supporting the nonuniversality hypothesis: the Gabaix-Gopikrishnan-Plerou-Stanley and the Farmer-Gerig-Lillo-Waelbroeck models (Nature 2003, QJE 2006, and Quant. Finance 2013). Our work provides exceptionally high-precision evidence for the universality hypothesis in social science and could prove useful in evaluating the price impact by large investors -- an important topic even among practitioners.

Title: Contagion mean field model for transport in urban traffic networks
Authors: Arturo Berrones Santos, Gerardo Palafox Castillo, Sareé González Huesca, Carlos Alberto Aldana Sandoval
Abstract: Theoretical arguments and empirical evidence for the emergence of macroscopic epidemic type behavior, in the form of Susceptible-Infected-Susceptible (SIS) or Susceptible-Infected-Recovered (SIR) processes in urban traffic congestion from microscopic network flows is given. Moreover, it's shown that the emergence of SIS/SIR implies a relationship between traffic flow and density, which is consistent with observations of the so called \emph{Fundamental Diagram of Traffic} (FDT), which is a characteristic signature of vehicle movement phenomena that spans multiple scales. Our results put in more firm grounds recent findings that indicate that traffic congestion at the aggregate level can be modeled by simple contagion dynamics.

Title: Emergent scattering regimes in disordered metasurfaces near critical packing
Authors: Miao Chen, Adrian Agreda, Tong Wu, Franck Carcenac, Kevin Vynck, Philippe Lalanne
Abstract: Disordered metasurfaces provide a versatile platform for harnessing near- and far-field scattered light. Most research has focused on either particulate topologies composed of individual, well-identified metaatoms or, to a lesser extent, semi-continuous aggregate topologies without well identified inclusions. Here, we uncover an intermediate critical packing regime characterized by metasurface morphologies in which a significant fraction of metaatoms begin to connect. We experimentally demonstrate that, at this threshold, the properties of the scattered light abruptly change and, via a statistical quasinormal mode analysis, interpret this change as a marked transition in the statistics of the photon density of states. Unlike percolation in semicontinuous metal films, this transition affects not only the specular but also the diffuse components of the scattered light in a profound way. Our results introduce critical packing topologies as a novel design strategy for manipulating the spectral and angular characteristics of light using ultrathin optical coatings. Emergent functionalities include colour shifts in diffuse light driven by multiple scattering and surface whitening, with potential applications in display technologies, for example, to reduce glare in electronic screens.

Title: The Motzkin Spaghetto
Authors: Zhao Zhang, Olai B. Mykland
Abstract: While highly entangled ground states of gapless local Hamiltonians have been known to exist in one dimension, their two-dimensional counterparts were only recently found, with rather sophisticated interactions involving at least four neighboring degrees of freedom. Here, we show that similar bipartite entanglement properties can be realized on a square lattice with anisotropic interactions in four different quadrants. The interaction to generate such entanglement is much simpler than the previous constructions by coupling orthogonal arrays of highly entangled chains. The new construction exhibits an entanglement phase transition with different scalings of entanglement entropy at the critical point and in the lowly entangled phase, and faster decay of the spectral gap in the highly entangled phase. The tensor network representation of the new ground state consists of tensors with lower rank, while preserving a global geometry similar to that of the original networks.

Title: Adaptive quantum dynamics with the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo method
Authors: Raffaele Salioni, Rocco Martinazzo, Davide Emilio Galli, Christian Apostoli
Abstract: We introduce an extension of the time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) method that adaptively controls the expressivity of the variational quantum state during the simulation of the dynamics. This adaptive tVMC (atVMC) approach is specifically designed to enhance numerical stability when overparameterized variational ansätze lead to ill-conditioned equations of motion. Building on the concept of the local-in-time error (LITE), a measure of the deviation between variational and exact evolution, we introduce a procedure to quantify each parameter's contribution to reducing the LITE, using only quantities already computed in standard tVMC simulations. These relevance estimates guide the selective evolution of only the most significant parameters at each time step, while maintaining a prescribed level of accuracy. We benchmark the algorithm on quantum quenches in the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model using both spin-Jastrow and restricted Boltzmann machine wave functions, with an emphasis on overparameterized regimes. The adaptive scheme significantly improves numerical stability and reduces the need for strong regularization, enabling reliable simulations with highly expressive variational ansätze.

Title: Excitation Amplitude Sampling for Low Variance Electronic Structure on Quantum Computers
Authors: Connor Lenihan, Oliver J. Backhouse, Basil Ibrahim, Tom W. A. Montgomery, Phalgun Lolur, M. J. Bhaseen, George H. Booth
Abstract: We combine classical heuristics with partial shadow tomography to enable efficient protocols for extracting information from correlated ab initio electronic systems encoded on quantum devices. By proposing the use of a correlation energy functional and sampling of a polynomial set of excitation amplitudes of the quantum state, we can demonstrate an almost two order of magnitude reduction in required number of shots for a given statistical error in the energy estimate, as well as observing a linear scaling to accessible system sizes. Furthermore, we find a high-degree of noise resilience of these estimators on real quantum devices, with up to an order of magnitude increase in the tolerated noise compared to traditional techniques. While these approaches are expected to break down asymptotically, we find strong evidence that these large system arguments do not prevent algorithmic advantage from these simple protocols in many systems of interest. We further extend this to consider the extraction of beyond-energetic properties by mapping to a coupled cluster surrogate model, as well as a natural combination within a quantum embedding framework. This embedding framework avoids the unstable self-consistent requirements of previous approaches, enabling application of quantum solvers to realistic correlated materials science, where we demonstrate the volume-dependence of the spin gap of Nickel Oxide.

Title: Modification of adhesion between microparticles and engineered silicon surfaces
Authors: Fabian Resare, Somiya Islam Soke, Witlef Wieczorek
Abstract: A key challenge in performing experiments with microparticles is controlling their adhesion to substrates. For example, levitation of a microparticle initially resting on a surface requires overcoming the surface adhesion forces to deliver the microparticle into a mechanical potential acting as a trap. By engineering the surface of silicon substrates, we aim to decrease the adhesion force between a metallic microparticle and the silicon surface. To this end, we investigate different methods of surface engineering that are based on chemical, physical, or physio-chemical modifications of the surface of silicon. We give quantitative results on the detachment force, finding a correlation between the water contact angle and the mean detachment force, indicating that hydrophobic surfaces are desired for low microparticle adhesion. We develop surface preparations decreasing the mean detachment force by more than a factor of three compared to an untreated silicon surface. Our results will enable reliable levitation of microparticles and are relevant for experiments requiring low adhesion between microparticles and a surface.

Title: Infinite matrix product states for $(1+1)$-dimensional gauge theories
Authors: Ross Dempsey, Anna-Maria E. Glück, Silviu S. Pufu, Benjamin T. Søgaard
Abstract: We present a matrix product operator construction that allows us to represent the lattice Hamiltonians of (abelian or non-abelian) gauge theories in a local and manifestly translation-invariant form. In particular, we use symmetric matrix product states and introduce link-enhanced matrix product operators (LEMPOs) that can act on both the physical and virtual spaces of the matrix product states. This construction allows us to study Hamiltonian lattice gauge theories on infinite lattices. As examples, we show how to implement this method to study the massless and massive one-flavor Schwinger model and adjoint QCD$_2$.

Title: Physics-informed neural network for fatigue life prediction of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic steels
Authors: Dhiraj S Kori, Abhinav Chandraker, Syed Abdur Rahman, Punit Rathore, Ankur Chauhan
Abstract: This study proposes a Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) framework to predict the low-cycle fatigue (LCF) life of irradiated austenitic and ferritic/martensitic (F/M) steels used in nuclear reactors. During operation, these materials undergo cyclic loading and irradiation at elevated temperatures, resulting in complex degradation mechanisms that traditional empirical or purely data-driven models often fail to capture accurately. The developed PINN model incorporates physical fatigue life constraints into its loss function, improving prediction accuracy, reliability, and generalizability. Trained on 495 data points, including both irradiated and unirradiated conditions, the model is more robust than traditional machine learning models, such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, eXtreme Gradient Boosting, and the conventional Neural Network. Model interpretability assessed via SHapley Additive exPlanations analysis revealed that strain amplitude, irradiation dose, and test temperature are the dominant features, each exhibiting a physically consistent inverse correlation with fatigue life. Univariate and multivariate analyses showed that strain amplitude is the primary driver of fatigue degradation in both alloy classes, while irradiation dose and temperature introduce alloy-specific sensitivities. The PINN successfully captured key mechanistic trends, including the comparatively stable irradiation response and dose saturation behaviour of F/M steels, as well as a pronounced reduction in fatigue life at elevated temperatures exceeding the tempering threshold. Overall, the proposed PINN framework offers a reliable and interpretable tool for predicting fatigue life in irradiated structural alloys, thereby supporting informed materials selection and performance assessment for advanced nuclear reactor applications.

Title: Ultrafast Optical Probing of Laser Processing
Authors: Jörn Bonse
Abstract: Laser treatment has emerged into a cornerstone of industrial manufacturing. This creates the demand to understand in detail the involved physical processes and their dynamics, to control the process, and to keep guard in-situ the laser manufacturing steps. Given the contactless interaction of light with matter, particularly optical methods appear most suitable for probing laser processing. This chapter reviews the current scientific and technological state of analyzing laser-based material processing by short and ultrashort optical pulses. For that, sequential passive interrogation of material properties (via reflection, absorption, scattering, diffraction, interference, or specific nonlinear responses) can be employed through so-called pump-probe techniques (where the time-resolution is not given by the detector response time but by the duration of an electromagnetic probe pulse that is interrogating the transient scenery at a controlled delay (typ. fs to \mu s) with respect to the arrival of the pump laser pulse). These approaches are capable to analyze on microscopic to macroscopic scales a plethora of different processes involved in laser processing, such as heating, melting, ablation, plasma- and shockwave-formation, optical breakdown in surrounding liquids and gases, shielding and accumulation effects, surface solidification and restructuring, etc. A special focus is set on the variety of ultrafast optical imaging schemes for visualizing the dynamics of laser processing at the surface and in the bulk of the irradiated materials, including photography and microscopy, holography, tomography, ptychography, and coherent diffractive imaging. The chapter provides a historic survey, highlights important scientific and technological developments and breakthroughs, discusses selected applications, explores the requirements and current limitations, and sheds light on emerging future trends.

Title: Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion
Authors: Zhijin Li
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to a few parameters, which are known only at leading order in perturbative expansions. The major challenges come from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and that it is closely related to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of conserved current 3-point correlators using exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep only the first few terms in the subgraph expansions to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative results with the bootstrap data and discuss their application to conductivity near the quantum critical point.

Title: How Does Incubation Affect Laser Material Processing?
Authors: Matthias Lenzner, Jörn Bonse
Abstract: In the last decades, the subject of laser-induced damage (LID) moved from a topic of scientific interest toward laser material processing for technical applications. When using pulsed lasers, the cumulative effect known as incubation is one of the most fundamental features of the processing event. Incubation manifests by the fact that the critical fluence for LID (known as laser-induced damage threshold, LIDT) depends on the number of pulses N exciting one spot on the sample. In most cases, the threshold fluence decreases with N starting from the single-shot ablation threshold and remains constant for large N. No ablation or damage occurs for any N, if the fluence is kept below the multiple-pulse threshold. In contrast, examples where the LIDT increases with N have been reported. The latter effect is known as laser conditioning and is advantageously used when ramping up the power of high-power laser systems. Incubation has been described for many types of solids; the motivation for these comprehensive efforts is twofold. Firstly, one tries to prevent the damage of optical materials in the beam path of high-energy or high-peak-power lasers. Secondly, one deliberately uses this damage for the sculpting of components. In this chapter, we introduce the reader to the mechanisms of incubation. We are going to look at the parameters controlling LID and highlight the peculiarity of the parameter "number of pulses". We will give an overview of the experimental work done in a variety of materials. There are several physical and chemical mechanisms proposed that govern incubation, and there are several mathematical models to describe the behavior of threshold fluence and ablation rate in dependence on the number of pulses. In a few cases, the two classes of mechanisms are even related to each other. Eventually, we will show the implications that incubation has on real-world laser machining.

Title: Backreaction equations for 1+1 dimensional BEC sonic black holes
Authors: Roberto Balbinot, Alessandro Fabbri, Giorgio Ciliberto, Nicolas Pavloff
Abstract: As in the gravitational context, one of the most challenging open question in analogue black holes formed in Bose-Einstein condensates concerns the backreaction of Hawking-like radiation on the condensate and its subsequent evolution. In this work we derive the basic equations describing this backreaction within the density-phase formalism, which avoids infrared divergences and is particularly well suited to one-dimensional configurations.

Title: A self-organized compression network arrests epithelial proliferation
Authors: Liav Daraf, Yael Lavi, Areej Saleem, Daniel Sevilla Sanchez, Yuri Feldman, Lior Atia
Abstract: As epithelial development or wound closure approaches completion, cell proliferation progressively slows via contact inhibition of proliferation (CIP) - a mechanism understood as being strictly local. Here we report the discovery of inhibition of proliferation through an unanticipated mechanism that is non-local. As a confluent epithelial layer becomes progressively more jammed, two interpenetrating networks emerge: islands of mechanically compressed non-cycling cells percolating within an ocean of mechanically tensed cycling cells. The evolution of the compression network was found to be susceptible to both specific molecular stimulus and to injury-induced unjamming. Yet, in all circumstances, the size of compressed islands followed a power-law distribution that was well-captured by preferential network theory. Together, these findings demonstrate the existence of a network-based inhibition of proliferation (NIP) that is self-organizing and poised in proximity to criticality.

Title: Light in Slices: How to Enable Precise Laser Processing?
Authors: Stefan Nolte, Jörn Bonse, Nadezhda M. Bulgakova
Abstract: Ultrashort (femtosecond, fs) laser pulses have fascinating properties as they allow to confine optical energy on extreme scales in space and time. Such fs-laser pulsed beams can be seen as spatially thin slices of intense light that are radially and axially constrained to the micrometer scale, while simultaneously propagating at the extremely high speed of light. Their high peak intensities and their short time lapse makes such laser pulses unique tools for materials processing, as their duration is shorter than the time required to transfer absorbed optical energy, via electron-phonon coupling, from the electronic system of the solid to its lattice. Hence, the laser pulse energy remains localized during the interaction and does not spread via diffusion into the area surrounding the irradiated region. As one consequence, the fs-laser thus offers increased precision for material modification or ablation accompanied by a reduced heat-affected zone of only a few hundred nanometers. On the other hand, the high laser peak intensities can enable nonlinear material interactions that are rendering unique material excitation and relaxation pathways possible. In this chapter, we briefly review the reasons for the enormous success of ultrashort pulse lasers in materials processing - both for the processing of the surface or in the bulk of solids. We identify the underlying fundamental processes that can limit the precision or the up-scaling of the laser processing towards large volumes, areas, or processing rates. Strategies to overcome such limitations will be outlined and questions on the ultimate limits of laser material processing will be answered.

Title: Strong coupling of collective optical resonances in dielectric metasurfaces
Authors: Izzatjon Allayarov, Vittorio Aita, Diane J. Roth, Boaz van Casteren, Anton Yu. Bykov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Anatoly V. Zayats, Antonio Calà Lesina
Abstract: Dielectric metasurfaces can achieve strong light-matter interaction based on several types of collective (nonlocal) resonances, such as surface lattice resonances (SLRs) and quasi bound states in the continuum (quasi-BICs). Spectral selectivity, field enhancement, and high and controllable Q-factors make these resonances appealing for technological applications in lasing, sensing, nonlinear optics, and quantum photon sources. An emerging challenge focuses on tailoring light-matter interaction via mode coupling and hybridization between the fundamental resonances of a metasurface. While strong coupling phenomena have been demonstrated between various resonant modes, the interplay between collective resonances of different natures has not been observed to date. Here, we theoretically, numerically, and experimentally demonstrate the onset of coupling and hybridization between symmetry-protected quasi-BICs and SLRs in a dielectric metasurface. We show the emergence of anticrossing (or Rabi splitting) in the strong coupling regime with suppression of reflection, observed under TE-polarised excitation, and the manifestation of an accidental BIC under TM-polarised illumination as a result of energy exchange between the participating collective resonances in the weak coupling regime. The first effect is accompanied by hybridized near fields of the modes. The observed coupling mechanisms can be controlled by modifying the angle of incidence, polarisation, and surrounding environment. This foundational study on the coupling and hybridization of collective resonances offers insights that can be leveraged for the design of metasurfaces with targeted quasi-aBIC and collective hybridized resonances. It could also open new possibilities to control the near fields associated with such resonances, with promising applications in tunable nanophotonics and light manipulation.

Title: Dipole-quadrupole model and multipole analysis of resonant membrane metasurfaces
Authors: Izzatjon Allayarov, Andrey B. Evlyukhin, Antonio Calà Lesina
Abstract: Membrane-metasurfaces, formed by periodic arrangements of holes in a dielectric layer, are gaining attention for their easier manufacturing via subtractive techniques, unnecessity of substrates, and access to resonant near-fields. Despite their practical relevance, their theoretical description remains elusive. Here, we present a semi-analytical dipole-quadrupole model for the multipole analysis of numerically-obtained reflection and transmission spectra in metasurfaces excited at arbitrary angles. Dipole models are generally sufficient to study traditional metasurfaces made of solid nanostructures. However, the inclusion of electric and magnetic quadrupoles is necessary to study membrane-metasurfaces, which offer an ideal platform to showcase our method. We demonstrate the importance of choosing the optimal position of a symmetric membrane-metasurface's unit cell to ensure the sufficiency of the dipole-quadrupole approximation. We show that our formalism can explain complex phenomena arising from inter-multipole interference, including lattice anapole and generalized Kerker effects, Fano resonances, and quasi-bound states in the continuum. We also present the applicability of the method to membrane-metasurfaces with non-centrosymmetric unit cells (e.g., conical holes and surface voids). By enabling a deeper insight into the coupling mechanisms leading to the formation of local and collective resonances, our method expands the electromagnetics toolbox to study, understand, and design conventional and membrane-metasurfaces.

Title: Clifford Hierarchy Stabilizer Codes: Transversal Non-Clifford Gates and Magic
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Guanyu Zhu, Po-Shen Hsin
Abstract: A fundamental problem in fault-tolerant quantum computation is the tradeoff between universality and dimensionality, exemplified by the the Bravyi-König bound for $n$-dimensional topological stabilizer codes. In this work, we extend topological Pauli stabilizer codes to a broad class of $n$-dimensional Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes. These codes correspond to the $(n+1)$D Dijkgraaf-Witten gauge theories with non-Abelian topological order. We construct transversal non-Clifford gates through automorphism symmetries represented by cup products. In 2D, we obtain the first transversal non-Clifford logical gates including T and CS for Clifford stabilizer codes, using the automorphism of the twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory (equivalent to $\mathbb{D}_4$ topological order). We also combine it with the just-in-time decoder to fault-tolerantly prepare the logical T magic state in $O(d)$ rounds via code switching. In 3D, we construct a transversal logical $\sqrt{\text{T}}$ gate in a non-Clifford stabilizer code at the third level of the Clifford hierarchy, located on a tetrahedron corresponding to a twisted $\mathbb{Z}_2^4$ gauge theory. Due to the potential single-shot code-switching properties of these codes, one could achieve the 4th level of Clifford hierarchy with an $O(d^3)$ space-time overhead, avoiding the tradeoff observed in 2D. We propose a conjecture extending the Bravyi-König bound to Clifford hierarchy stabilizer codes, with our explicit constructions surpassing the Bravyi-König bound for achieving the logical gates in the $(n+1)$-th level of Clifford hierarchy in $n$ spatial dimension.

Title: Braided QM and Majorana qubits at third root of unity: a color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebra framework
Authors: Zhanna Kuznetsova, Francesco Toppan
Abstract: We introduce color Heisenberg-Lie (super)algebras graded by the abelian groups $Z_3^2$, $Z_2^p\times Z_3^2$ for $p=1,2,3$, and investigate the properties of their associated multi-particle quantum paraoscillators. In the Rittenberg-Wyler's color Lie (super)algebras framework the above abelian groups are the simplest ones which induce mixed brackets interpolating commutators and anticommutators. These mixed brackets allow to accommodate two types of parastatistics: one based on the permutation group (beyond bosons and fermions in any space dimension) and an anyonic parastatistics based on the braid group. In both such cases the two broad classes of paraparticles are given by parabosons and parafermions. Mixed-bracket parafermions are created by nilpotent operators; they satisfy a generalized Pauli exclusion principle leading to roots-of-unity truncations in their multi-particle energy spectrum (braided Majorana qubits and their Gentile-type parastatistics are recovered in this color Lie superalgebra setting). Mixed-bracket parabosons do not admit truncations of the spectrum; the minimal detectable signature of their parastatistics is encoded in the measurable probability density of two indistinguishable parabosonic oscillators in a given energy eigenstate.

Title: Entanglement transition in unitary system-bath dynamics
Authors: Bo Xing, Giuliano Chiriacò, Paola Cappellaro, Rosario Fazio, Dario Poletti
Abstract: The evolution of a system coupled to baths is commonly described by a master equation that, in the long-time limit, yields a steady-state density matrix. However, when the same evolution is unraveled into quantum trajectories, it is possible to observe a transition in the scaling of entanglement within the system as the system-bath coupling increases - a phenomenon that is invisible in the trajectory-averaged reduced density matrix of the system. Here, we go beyond the paradigm of trajectories from master equations and explore whether a qualitatively analogous entanglement-scaling transition emerges in the unitary evolution of the combined system-bath setup. We investigate the scaling of entanglement in a unitary quantum setup composed of a 2D lattice of free fermions, where each site is coupled to a fermionic bath. Varying the system-bath coupling reveals a transition from logarithmic-law to area-law scaling, visible in the logarithmic fermionic negativity, mutual information, and also in the correlations. This occurs while the system's steady-state properties are trivial, highlighting that the signatures of these different scalings are within the bath-bath correlations.

Title: Anomalous Wave-Packet Dynamics in One-Dimensional Non-Hermitian Lattices
Authors: Yanyan He, Tomoki Ozawa
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) systems have attracted great attention due to their exotic phenomena beyond Hermitian domains. Here we study the wave-packet dynamics in general one-dimensional NH lattices and uncover several unexpected phenomena. The group velocity of a wave packet during the time evolution in such NH lattices is not only governed by the real part of the band structure but also by its imaginary part. The momentum also evolves due to the imaginary part of the band structure, which can lead to a self-induced Bloch oscillation in the absence of external fields. Furthermore, we discover the wave-packet dynamics can exhibit disorder-free NH jumps even when the energy spectra are entirely real. Finally, we show that the NH jumps can lead to both positive and negative temporal Goos--Hänchen shifts at the edge.
