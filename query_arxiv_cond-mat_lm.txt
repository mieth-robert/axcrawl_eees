Title: Hidden Twisted Sectors and Exponential Degeneracy in Root-of-Unity XXZ Heisenberg Chains
Authors: Yongao Hu, Felix Gerken, Thore Posske
Abstract: Recently, product states have been identified as simple-structured eigenstates of XXZ Heisenberg spin models in arbitrary dimensions, occurring at anisotropy values corresponding to certain roots of unity. Yet, the product states typically only span parts of a larger degenerate eigenspace. Here, we classify this eigenspace in the one-dimensional periodic XXZ chain at all roots of unity $q$, where $q^2$ is an $\ell$-th primitive root of unity. For commensurate chain lengths $N$ with $q^N=1$, we prove that the minimal degeneracy is $2^{N/\ell}\ell$ using the representation theory of the affine Temperley-Lieb (aTL) algebra. For the incommensurate case, we derive analogous exponential lower bounds of $2^{2\lfloor\frac{N}{2\ell}\rfloor+1}$ if $N$ is even and $2^{2\lfloor \frac{N}{2\ell}+\frac{1}{2}\rfloor}$ if $N$ is odd and $q^\ell=1$. Our proof employs the morphisms between aTL modules discovered by Pinet and Saint-Aubin and emphasizes the importance of exact sequences and hidden twisted boundary condition sectors that mediate the degeneracy. In the case of commensurate chain lengths, we connect to the Fabricius-McCoy string construction of all Bethe roots of the degenerate subspace, which previously uncovered parts of our results. We corroborate our results numerically and demonstrate that the lower bound is saturated for chain lengths $N\leq20$. Our work demonstrates for a concrete system how the interplay of the Bethe ansatz, aTL representation theory, and twisted boundary conditions explains degeneracy connected to long-lived product states, stimulating research towards generalization to higher dimensions. Exponential degeneracy could boost applications of spin chains as quantum sensors.

Title: Topological superconductivity with emergent vortex lattice in twisted semiconductors
Authors: Daniele Guerci, Ahmed Abouelkomsan, Liang Fu
Abstract: The coexistence of superconductivity and fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect has recently been observed in twisted MoTe$_2$ and theoretically demonstrated in a model of repulsively interacting electrons under an emergent magnetic field arising from the layer pseudospin texture in moiré superlattice. Here, we show that this superconducting state is a chiral $f$-wave superconductor hosting an array of $double$ vortices, which are induced by the emergent magnetic field with $h/e$ flux quanta per moiré unit cell. This superconducting vortex lattice state is topological and features Chern number $-1/2$, giving rise to a half-integer thermal Hall conductance. Our theory provides a common mechanism and unified understanding of FQAH and topological superconductivity, with a rich phase diagram controlled by the spatial modulation of the emergent magnetic field.

Title: Inhomogeneous quenches and GHD in the $ν= 1$ QSSEP model
Authors: Angelo Russotto, Filiberto Ares, Pasquale Calabrese, Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of the $\nu=1$ Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process starting from spatially inhomogeneous initial states. This one-dimensional system of free fermions has time-dependent stochastic hopping amplitudes that are uniform in space. We focus on two paradigmatic setups: domain-wall melting and the expansion of a trapped gas. Both are investigated by extending the framework of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to account for the underlying stochastic dynamics. We derive the evolution of the local quasiparticle occupation function, which characterizes the system at large space-time scales, and analyze the resulting entanglement spreading. By incorporating quantum fluctuations of the occupation function and employing conformal field theory techniques, we obtain the exact contribution to the entanglement entropy for each individual noise realization. Averaging over these realizations then yields the full entanglement statistics in the hydrodynamic regime. Our theoretical predictions are confirmed by exact numerical calculations. The results presented here constitute the first application of quantum generalized hydrodynamics to stochastic quantum systems, demonstrating that this framework can be successfully extended beyond purely unitary dynamics to include stochastic effects.

Title: Complex Magnetic Behavior in RuO$_2$ Thin Films: Strain, Surface Effects, and Altermagnetic Signatures
Authors: Mojtaba Alaei, Nafise Rezaei, Ilia Mikhailov, Artem R. Oganov, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: RuO$_2$ has been proposed as a prototypical metallic $d$-wave altermagnet, a Néel-ordered compensated antiferromagnetic state exhibiting nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting; yet, its magnetic ground state remains controversial both theoretically and experimentally. Using comprehensive first-principles calculations, we investigate RuO$_2$ thin films with (110), (100), and (001) orientations, both freestanding and supported on a TiO$_2$ substrate. We show that magnetism in RuO$_2$ thin films is highly fragile, strongly influenced by strain, surface orientation, and atomic relaxation, while also being highly sensitive to the choice of the Brillouin-zone integration scheme. Although tensile strain induces finite magnetic moments, none of the studied systems stabilizes a compensated antiferromagnetic state; hence, an altermagnetic ground state cannot be achieved. Instead, the magnetic response is characterized by pronounced layer- and site-dependent variations and incomplete moment compensation, resembling a ferrimagnetic-like state. Our results reconcile conflicting theoretical and experimental reports and underscore the sensitivity of RuO$_2$ magnetism to structural and methodological details.

Title: Band splitting in altermagnet CrSb
Authors: Vladimir P.Mineev
Abstract: Altermegnets are a class of metallic magnets characterized by spin-split electron bands. Band splitting in the hexagonal altermagnet CrSb was studied using the ARPES method, magnetotransport and torque measurements, combined with DFT+U calculations. The shape, position, and even symmetry of the Fermi surfaces found in these studies vary. The developed approach, based on symmetry considerations, allows us to establish several general properties of band splitting in the altermagnet CrSb, including the symmetry of the spin distribution in each electron band, the symmetry of the bands in an external magnetic field, and the dependence of the frequencies and amplitudes of quantum oscillations on the magnetic field.

Title: Bond percolation in distorted simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices
Authors: Bishnu Bhowmik, Sayantan Mitra, Robert M. Ziff, Ankur Sensharma
Abstract: We investigate the effect of structural distortion on bond percolation in simple cubic and body-centered cubic lattices using extensive Monte Carlo simulations. Distortion is introduced through controlled random displacements of lattice sites, thereby modifying nearest-neighbor distances. Bond occupation is permitted only when the bond length is smaller than a prescribed connection threshold, directly coupling geometric disorder to connectivity. Finite-size scaling analysis is employed to determine percolation thresholds for finite systems and in the thermodynamic limit. We find that when the connection threshold exceeds the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, the percolation threshold increases monotonically with distortion strength, indicating a systematic suppression of spanning. In contrast, this monotonic behavior breaks down when the connection threshold is below the nearest-neighbor distance of the undistorted lattice, highlighting a nontrivial interplay between geometric distortion and connectivity. We further identify critical values of the connection threshold and the distortion amplitude required for global spanning when all the allowed bonds are occupied. All qualitative behaviors remain robust across both lattice geometries. These results clarify how geometric disorder reshapes percolation in three-dimensional crystalline networks.

Title: Deciphering Majorana Zero Modes in Topological Superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 with Machine-Learning-Assisted Spectral Deconvolution
Authors: Jewook Park, Hoyeon Jeon, Dongwon Shin, Guannan Zhang, Michael A McGuire, Brian C. Sales, An-Ping Li
Abstract: An unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSC) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunnelling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis in disentangling genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow paves the way to further manipulating MZMs in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.

Title: Finding the Edge of Chaos in a Ferromagnet: Quantifying the "Complexity" of 2D Ising Phase Transitions with Image Compression
Authors: Cooper Jacobus
Abstract: The data-driven characterization of the ``complexity'' present in dynamical systems remains an open problem with broad applications across the physical sciences. We investigate the ``structural complexity'' of the 2D ferromagnetic Ising model, a paradigmatic system exhibiting a second-order phase transition at a certain critical temperature which is often cited as a canonical example of complex morphology. We define a quantitative metric for this structural complexity, $\mathcal C_s$, through the lens of algorithmic information theory by approximating the Kolmogorov complexity of lattice configurations via standard lossless image compression algorithms. We regularize our proposed metric, $\mathcal C_s$, by comparing the compressibility of a configuration to that of its pixel-wise sorted and randomly shuffled counterparts. We arrive at a definition of $\mathcal C_s$ as a product of two components representing the systems departure from perfect order and disorder respectively which we then plot as a function of temperature. Our numerical simulations reveal a distinct peak in $\mathcal C_s$ at the known critical temperature $T_c$. This result demonstrates that such information-theoretic measures can act as sensitive, model-agnostic indicators of criticality, directly quantifying the emergence of complex structure at the boundary between order and chaos, opening the door to data-driven applications in domains where analytic solutions are unavailable.

Title: Diode effect in microwave irradiated Josephson junctions with Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states
Authors: Aritra Lahiri, Marcel Polák, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: We investigate the critical current in microwave-irradiated Josephson junctions hosting Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states due to magnetic impurities. Under two conditions, namely, (i) the breaking of particle-hole symmetry in the normal sense by non-zero potential scattering, and (ii) the breaking of inversion symmetry either by unequal magnitudes of potential scattering and/or magnetic moments, microwave irradiation induces an additional phase-independent contribution to the current. This leads to asymmetric critical currents for opposite current polarities, an effect absent in the same junction without microwave irradiation. The asymmetry is highly tunable via the microwave amplitude and frequency, and we may even achieve perfect asymmetry where the critical current vanishes for one polarity, akin to a perfect diode. While Yu-Shiba-Rusinov states provide the ideal platform for a pronounced asymmetry, we find that as long as the two conditions (i) and (ii) above are met, our proposal does not necessarily depend upon them.

Title: Phase Transitions in Neural Networks Pruning
Authors: Diego Pesce (1,2), Yang-Hui He (3,4), Guido Caldarelli (5,6,3) ((1) Dipartimento di Fisica, Universit`a di Milano - Bicocca, Milano, Italy, (2) ASC27, Rome, Italy, (3) London Institute for Mathematical Sciences (LIMS), Royal Institution, London, UK (4) Merton College, University of Oxford, UK (5) CNR-ISC Institute of Complex Systems, Rome, Italy, (6) DSMN and ECLT, Ca'Foscari University of Venice, Venice, Italy)
Abstract: Deep neural networks are strongly over-parameterized, often containing far more weights than required for their task. Although such redundancy can aid optimization, it leads to inefficient deployment and high computational cost, motivating model compression techniques. Among these, network pruning provides a clear and effective route to sparsity. We study pruning from a statistical-physics perspective, interpreting performance degradation under weight removal as a phase transition. Focusing on magnitude-based pruning with fine-tuning, we show that deep networks undergo a sharp transition from a cooperative, functional phase to a disordered phase with collapsed performance. This transition is characterized by scaling laws consistent with second-order critical behavior, with connectivity as the control parameter. Our findings suggest universal pruning-induced criticality across architectures and datasets. Finally, we show that there exists a large class of subnetworks sharing the same nodes' degrees with similar learning ability, thus linking model performance to its topological properties.

Title: Eutectic and peritectic equilibria in coherent binary alloys
Authors: Samiah Hassan, Jiayang Wang, Teddy Meissner, Pierre A. Deymier, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: This work extends the Cahn--Larché thermodynamic framework to binary alloys in which two coherent solid phases coexist with an incoherent liquid and investigates how coherency strain energy modifies classical eutectic and peritectic equilibria. We derive equilibrium conditions for three-phase coexistence that include an elastic energy term dependent on the molar fractions of the solid phases and apply them to model binary eutectic and peritectic systems. We find that coherency stress transforms the eutectic point into a finite three-phase equilibrium field spanning a continuous range of compositions and temperatures. In contrast, coherency stress in peritectic systems progressively destabilizes the two-solid equilibrium without generating a stable three-phase field and can suppress the peritectic reaction entirely. This asymmetry is governed by the geometric relationship between the stress-free compositions of the phases: when the liquid composition lies between those of the two solids (eutectic configuration), the liquid serves as a thermodynamic buffer against the coherency penalty on the solid--solid pair; when it lies outside (peritectic configuration), no such mechanism is available. These results demonstrate that coherency stress can fundamentally alter three-phase equilibria involving a liquid and suggest that such effects may be significant in systems with large coherent misfits.

Title: Universal electrical transport of composite Fermi liquid to Metal transition in Moiré systems
Authors: Youxuan Wang, Rongning Liu, Feng Liu, Xueyang Song
Abstract: We compute universal electrical transport near continuous transitions between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a metallic phase in moire Chern bands, focusing on fillings $\nu=-1/2$ and $\nu=-3/4$. The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $\Sigma(\omega/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $\sigma(0) \approx 0.033 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons "filtering" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode. Our approach provides concrete transport diagnostics for detecting quantum criticality in moire superlattices.

Title: A brief review of high-entropy oxides in solid oxide fuel cell applications
Authors: Yueyuan Gu, Juan Shi, Dilshod Nematov, Aoqi Liu, Yanru Yin, Hailu Dai, Lei Bi
Abstract: Solid oxide fuel cells are efficient energy conversion devices essential to clean energy development, yet their broad application is limited by material challenges, including sluggish oxygen reduction kinetics at intermediate temperatures, electrode instability and vulnerability to contaminants. High-entropy oxides, a novel class of materials characterized by multiple principal elements and high configurational entropy, present a promising approach to overcome these issues via their distinctive "four core effects". This review begins with the fundamentals of high-entropy materials, covering their definition, phase stabilization mechanisms, and relevant descriptors, then systematically reviews their progress as SOFC cathodes, electrolytes, and anodes. Key advances are summarized, and current challenges are analyzed, offering guidance for the design of high-performance and stable high-entropy oxides for solid oxide fuel cells.

Title: Transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion
Authors: P.O. Kazinski, P.S. Korolev
Abstract: The theory of transition radiation in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion is developed in the framework of an effective field theory approach. The average number of photons radiated by a charged particle passing through a plate made of this metamaterial is obtained. Given the positions of the transition radiation maxima in momentum space for different velocities of a charged particle, the method for reconstruction of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in metamaterials is proposed. Applying this method conversely, one can predict the radiation spectrum and polarization properties of transition radiation by means of the dispersion law of plasmon-polaritons in the metamaterial known, for example, from the effective model. It is shown that the strong spatial dispersion alters qualitatively the properties of transition radiation from a charged particle traversing normally a plate made of the helical metamaterial along its symmetry axis in the paraxial regime, viz., there is a nonzero forward radiation in contrast to transition radiation in media without strong spatial dispersion. Vavilov-Cherenkov radiation and the anomalous Doppler effect in helical metamaterials with strong spatial dispersion are described.

Title: Hidden Structural Control of Solvent Transport under Soft Jamming
Authors: Kento Tamaki, Naoya Yanagisawa, Rei Kurita
Abstract: Transport in soft jammed materials is often described as fluid motion through a fixed structure, leading naturally to capillary based descriptions. This picture appears particularly appropriate in strongly jammed systems, where structural rearrangements are suppressed and little visible motion is observed. Here we investigate solvent transport in foam and show that this intuition fails to capture key aspects of the transport process. By directly observing both liquid penetration and bubble motion under controlled boundary conditions, we demonstrate that solvent transport is strongly influenced by the mechanical response of the foam structure, even though the intrinsic imbibition relative to the foam matrix remains purely capillary-driven. In closed systems, the jammed structure resists penetration and leads to a pronounced slowdown that cannot be accounted for by purely capillary descriptions. In contrast, in open systems, collective bubble motion accompanies solvent invasion, resulting in an apparent acceleration of transport. These results indicate that the lack of structural motion does not guarantee a purely capillary description of transport. Our findings reveal a boundary controlled coupling between flow and structure, and highlight the need to reconsider transport processes in soft jammed systems, including foams, dense colloids, and biological tissues.

Title: Intrinsic low-spin state and strain-tunable anomalous Hall scaling in high-quality SrRuO3 (111) films
Authors: Harunori Shiratani, Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Yoshiharu Krockenberger, Masaki Kobayashi, Kohei Yamagami, Takahito Takeda, Shinobu Ohya, Masaaki Tanaka, Yoshitaka Taniyasu
Abstract: The (111)-oriented 4d ferromagnetic perovskite SrRuO3 (SRO) offers a unique triangular-lattice geometry, making it a promising platform for exploring Berry-curvature-driven and spin-orbit-coupled transport. Here, we present a systematic study of the structure, magnetism, and magnetotransport of high-quality SRO (111) thin films with thicknesses t = 1.2-60 nm grown on SrTiO3 (111) substrates by machine-learning-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. We achieved a residual resistivity ratio of 45.5 in a 60 nm-thick film, the highest reported for this orientation, enabling access to intrinsic electronic and magnetic behavior. Temperature-dependent resistivity confirms Fermi-liquid transport below 15 K in both coherently strained (t = 10, 20 nm) and strain-relaxed (t = 60 nm) films, thereby enabling detailed magnetotransport and magnetic measurements. The linear, non-saturating positive magnetoresistance persists up to 14 T, while Hall-effect measurements and temperature scaling separate intrinsic (Karplus-Luttinger) and extrinsic (side-jump) contributions to the anomalous Hall effect, with the relative weight tuned by (111) epitaxial strain. X-ray magnetic circular dichroism at the Ru M2,3 and O K edges, together with SQUID magnetometry, demonstrates an intrinsically low-spin Ru ground state for both coherently strained and relaxed films, resolving ambiguities among prior reports. These detailed crystalline, electrical, and magnetic characterizations provide a rigorous foundation for understanding and engineering quantum transport in SRO (111).

Title: Entropy Has No Direction: A Mirror-State Paradox Against Universal Monotonic Entropy Increase and a First-Principles Proof that Constraints Reshape the Entropy Distribution
Authors: Ting Peng
Abstract: We present a purely theoretical, self-contained argument that the Second Law of Thermodynamics cannot be a universal fundamental law in the form ``entropy does not decrease'' (whether asserted trajectory-wise or as a universal statistical principle) when the underlying microscopic dynamics are time-reversal invariant. The core is a mirror-state construction: for any microstate $A$ one constructs its time-reversed partner $B$ (momenta inverted). If a universal monotonicity statement is applied to both $A$ and $B$, it implies that $A$ is a local minimum of entropy at every moment, which forces entropy to be constant and destroys any entropic arrow of time. The consistent replacement is that entropy is a stochastic variable described by a probability distribution $P(S)$, whose shape depends on constraints and boundary conditions. We then prove from first principles that constraints necessarily reshape the long-time entropy distribution $P_{\infty}(S;\lambda)$ by altering the invariant measure through changes in the Hamiltonian and/or the accessible phase space. A sharp criterion is given: in the microcanonical setting, the \emph{only} way $P_{\infty}^{(E)}(S;\lambda)$ can remain the same up to translation is when all accessible macrostate volumes are scaled by a common factor; otherwise the distribution changes structurally.

Title: Dual thermodynamic ensembles, relative entropies, and excess free energy
Authors: Gavin E. Crooks
Abstract: It has long been known that the relative entropy of a non-equilibrium ensemble to the corresponding equilibrium ensemble is the excess free energy. We show that the reverse relative entropy also has a thermodynamic interpretation: it is the excess free energy of a dual ensemble in which the roles of energy and entropy are interchanged.

Title: Quantum Pontus--Mpemba Effect in Dissipative Quasiperiodic Chains
Authors: Yefeng Song, Junxiao Chen, Xiangyu Yang, Mingdi Xu, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We investigate how quasiperiodic spatial structure enables protocol-induced acceleration in open quantum systems by analyzing the Pontus-Mpemba effect in one-dimensional chains subject to Markovian dephasing. The dynamics are governed by a Lindblad superoperator that drives all initial states toward a maximally mixed infinite-temperature steady state, isolating dynamical mechanisms from static equilibrium properties. Considering two representative quasiperiodic models, namely a tight-binding chain with a mosaic potential and its extension with power-law long-range hopping, we show that a properly engineered two-step protocol, in which the system is first steered to a finite temperature intermediate state, yields a strictly shorter overall relaxation time than direct evolution from the same initial configuration. This protocol-induced acceleration persists for both initially localized and extended eigenstates and remains robust in the presence of long-range hopping. A Liouvillian spectral analysis reveals that the mechanism originates from a redistribution of spectral weight that suppresses overlap with the slowest decay modes, rather than from any modification of the decay spectrum itself. Our results establish quasiperiodic chains as a controlled setting for engineering relaxation pathways through Liouvillian spectral structure.

Title: Effects of quenched disorder in three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models
Authors: Claudio Bonati, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the effects of uncorrelated quenched disorder to the phase diagram and continuous transitions of three-dimensional lattice ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge Higgs models. For this purpose, we consider two types of quenched disorder, associated with the sites and plaquettes of the cubic lattice. In both cases, for sufficiently weak disorder, the phase diagram remains similar to that of the pure system, showing two different phases (one of them being a topologically ordered phase), separated by two different continuous transition lines. However, the quenched disorder changes the universality classes of the critical behaviors along some of the transition lines. The random-plaquette disorder turns out to be relevant along the topological ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge transition line, so the critical behaviors belong to the different random-plaquette $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge (RP${\mathbb Z}_2$G) universality class with length-scale exponent $\nu=\nu_{\rm rp}\approx 0.82$; on the other hand, it turns out to be irrelevant along the other Ising$^\times$ transition line (a variant of the Ising transitions with a gauge-dependent order parameter), leaving unchanged its asymptotic critical behaviors with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$. The random-site disorder leads to a substantially different scenario: it destabilizes the Ising$^\times$ critical behaviors of the pure model, changing them into those of the randomly-dilute Ising$^{\times}$ (RDI$^{\times}$) universality class with $\nu=\nu_{\rm rdi}\approx 0.68$, while the critical behaviors along the other ${\mathbb Z}_2$ gauge topological transition line remains stable, with $\nu=\nu_{\cal I}\approx 0.63$.

Title: Optimal conditions for detecting optical dichroism at the nanoscale by electron energy-loss spectroscopy
Authors: Marek Zálešák, Martin Ošmera, Martin Hrtoň, Andrea Konečná
Abstract: The emergence of optical circular dichroism in chiral nanoscale and molecular systems provides not only a way for analyzing the sample chirality itself but also additional degrees of freedom in manipulating light. Such manipulation can be reached even at the nanoscale level; however, probing and understanding the properties of optical fields well below the diffraction limit requires an adequate technique. Electron energy-loss spectroscopy (EELS) with orbital angular momentum (OAM)-based electron state sorting has been suggested as a suitable candidate, but to date, no conclusive experiments have been performed. We, therefore, theoretically explore the emergence of dichroism in EELS for a canonical single-twist helix nanostructure and present a detailed analysis of the optimal parameters to obtain a robust signal. Our work offers novel insights into the interpretation and volatility of the OAM-resolved EELS signal, which can inspire and guide future experimental efforts.

Title: Photoionization of temperature-controlled nanoparticles in a beam: Accurate and efficient determination of ionization energies and work functions
Authors: Atef A. Sheekhoon, Abdelrahman O. Haridy, Sebastian Pedalino, Vitaly V. Kresin
Abstract: A beam of free alkali metal nanoparticles is produced by a condensation source, passed through a thermalizing tube adjustable over a broad temperature range, and ionized by tunable light. High stability of the particle flux and an automated data acquisition routine allow efficient collection of photoionization yield curves. A careful fit of the data to the universal Fowler function makes it possible to obtain nanoparticle ionization energies, and from those, the metal work functions, with $\sim$0.2% precision. The experimental arrangement, nanoparticle thermalization rates, and ionization threshold analysis are described in detail. The use of ultrapure and temperature-controlled gas-phase nanoparticles facilitates the analysis of electronic properties, such as work functions, and of their interplay with thermal lattice dynamics.

Title: Temperature-dependent photoionization thresholds of alkali-metal nanoparticles reveal thermal expansion and the melting transition
Authors: Abdelrahman O. Haridy, Atef A. Sheekhoon, Vitaly V. Kresin
Abstract: A precision measurement of the photoionization of pure sodium and potassium nanoparticles isolated in a beam enabled an accurate determination of their work functions as a function of temperature. In addition to resolving and quantifying the initial gradual decrease of the work function with temperature, which is associated with thermal expansion, the experiment revealed that the work function then undergoes a distinct drop both in magnitude and in slope that signifies the onset of nanoparticle melting. This establishes that a structural phase transition can be detected via a high-resolution measurement of the photoemission threshold. The melting temperature of nanoparticles with diameters of 7-9 nm is reduced by nearly 100 K relative to the bulk value. This suppression aligns with predictions from the Gibbs-Thomson equation which describes finite-size phase transitions.

Title: Isotope effect in the work function of lithium
Authors: Atef A. Sheekhoon, Abdelrahman O. Haridy, Vitaly V. Kresin
Abstract: The work functions of 7Li and 6Li metals have been measured as a function of temperature, by using photoionization of pure isolated metal nanoparticles in a beam. These data reveal a marked isotope effect in the temperature variation of these work functions. Furthermore, for both isotopes the curvature of this temperature variation is found to be significantly larger than may be ascribed purely to a change in the electron gas density. These findings enhance the characterization of lithium as a quantum material in which the interplay between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom is nontrivial, and call for a microscopic understanding beyond simple models. Additionally, the slope of the work function curves was observed to vanish in the low temperature limit, as had been predicted on the basis of the Third Law of thermodynamics.

Title: Virtual ultrasound machine operating in a GHz to MHz frequency range for particle-based biomedical simulations
Authors: Urban Čoko, Tilen Potisk, Matej Praprotnik
Abstract: Ultrasound-matter interactions underpin numerous biomedical and soft-matter applications, yet simulating these phenomena is challenging due to the large separation of viscous and sonic time scales. Continuum methods capture large-scale wave propagation but cannot resolve microscale interactions, while particle-based approaches offer molecular resolution but struggle with efficiency and stability at larger scales. We introduce a particle-based virtual ultrasound machine that uses a novel smoothed dissipative particle dynamics variant with an implicit pressure solver and a negative-pressure stabilization scheme, required to mimic acoustic propagation across MHz-GHz frequencies. We demonstrate its capabilities by modeling the acoustophoresis of encapsulated microbubbles, a key mechanism in ultrasound-mediated drug delivery. Beyond this application, the approach establishes a generalizable platform for simulating wave-matter interactions in soft and biological materials, opening new directions for computational studies of acoustics-driven phenomena in science and engineering.

Title: Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering in layered trimer iridate Ba4Ir3 O10 : the density functional approach
Authors: D.A. Kukusta, L.V. Bekenov, V.N. Antonov
Abstract: We have investigated the electronic structure of Ba4Ir3O10 within the density-functional theory (DFT) using the generalized gradient approximation while considering strong Coulomb correlations (GGA+U) in the framework of the fully relativistic spin-polarized Dirac linear muffin-tin orbital band-structure method. Ba4Ir3O10 has a quasi-2D structure composed of buckled sheets, which constitute corner-connected Ir3O12 trimers containing three distorted face-sharing IrO6 octahedra. The Ir atoms are distributed over two symmetrically inequivalent sites: the center of the trimer (Ir1) and its two tips (Ir2). The Ir1 - Ir2 distance within the trimer is quite small and equals to 2.58 A at low temperature. As a result, the clear formation of bonding and antibonding states at the Ir1 site occurs. The large bonding-antibonding splitting stabilizes the dyz-orbital-dominant antibonding state of t2g holes and produces a wide energy gap at the Fermi level. However, the energy gap opens up only with taking into account strong Coulomb correlations at the Ir2 site. Therefore, we have quite a unique situation when the insulating state is driven by both the dimerization at the Ir1 site and Mott insulating behavior at the Ir2 one. We have investigated resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectra at the Ir L3 edge. The calculated results are in good agreement with experimental data. The RIXS spectrum possesses several sharp features below 2.1 eV corresponding to transitions within the Ir t2g levels. The excitation located from 2.1 to 4.6 eV is due to t2g to eg and O2p to t2g transitions. The wide structure situated at 6.2-12 eV appears due to charge transfer and O2p to eg transitions. We have also presented comprehensive theoretical calculations of the RIXS spectrum at the oxygen K edge.

Title: On the origin of in-gap states in amorphous Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$
Authors: Omar Abou El Kheir, Marco Bernasconi
Abstract: The localized states in the band gap of amorphous phase change alloys like Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ control the electrical conduction via the Poole-Frenkel mechanism. Understanding the origin of in-gap states and their evolution in time during aging of the glass is therefore important for the control of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices. Here, we use a machine learning interatomic potential to generate several models of Ge$_2$Sb$_2$Te$_5$ whose electronic structure is then analyzed within density functional theory with a hybrid functional. A detailed statistical analysis of the structural motifs on which the in-gap states are localized, reveals that the vast majority of in-gap states involve wrong bonds (homopolar or Ge-Sb bonds) often accompanied by Ge in tetrahedral configurations or overcoordinated Ge and Sb atoms. Metadynamics simulations mimicking glass aging support the picture that structural relaxations lead to the depletion of in-gap states and then to an increase of resistance. The simulations thus provide important insights for the mitigation of the resistance drift in phase change memory devices.

Abstract: Moiré semiconductors offer flat bands where Coulomb interactions and band topology intertwine, while interlayer coupling plays a central role in forming the moiré potential. However, limited interlayer coupling strength and the lack of efficient tuning methods hinder further exploration of correlated phenomena in moiré semiconductors. Here we introduce a cryogenic dual-gated diamond-anvil platform using helium as a pressure medium, enabling reversible hydrostatic tuning together with magneto-optical spectroscopy in twisted bilayer WSe2. Pressure enhances the moiré potential, redshifts excitons, and stabilizes Stoner ferromagnetism otherwise absent at a 3.1-degree twist. Simultaneously, the half-filled C = 1 Chern insulating state strengthens, exhibiting a reduced saturation field. Moreover, we observe a topological phase transition from a Chern insulator to a Mott insulator at around 2 GPa. First-principles calculations reveal that a Gamma-to-K valence-band-maximum switching drives this transition by converting an Ising-like topological K-valley miniband into a spin-degenerate trivial Gamma miniband. Our findings demonstrate hydrostatic pressure as a powerful, continuous control axis for correlated magnetism and topological band engineering in moiré materials.

Title: Electric-field-tuned consecutive topological phase transitions between distinct correlated insulators in moire MoTe2/WSe2 heterobilayer
Authors: Xumin Chang, Zui Tao, Bowen Shen, Wanghao Tian, Jenny Hu, Kateryna Pistunova, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Tony F. Heinz, Tingxin Li, Kin Fai Mak, Jie Shan, Shengwei Jiang
Abstract: Consecutive topological phase transitions (TPTs) between strongly correlated electronic phases that differ simultaneously in symmetry breaking and topological order are of fundamental interest in condensed matter physics, yet are rarely realized experimentally. We report two consecutive electric-field-driven TPTs at half filling (nu = 1) in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moire heterobilayers. With increasing out-of-plane displacement field, a geometrically frustrated Mott insulator evolves into a ferromagnetic quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) Mott insulator, i.e., a spin-polarized topological Mott insulator without an observable charge-gap closure, and subsequently into an antiferromagnetic, valley-coherent Mott insulator (VC-AFM) accompanied by a continuous charge-gap collapse and the emergence of a critical metallic state. Layer-resolved magnetic circular dichroism (MCD), magneto-transport, and compressibility measurements jointly determine the phase diagram. The high-field evolution of the antiferromagnetic state reveals a metamagnetic-like transition at a critical field B*, above which a Chern insulating transport response reappears. Our results establish the MoTe2/WSe2 moire platform as a tunable realization of an extended Kane-Mele-Hubbard model hosting sequential correlation-topology-intertwined transitions.

Title: Uniform Narrow Excitonic Spectrum in Large-Area Suspended WSe2 Monolayers
Authors: Giacomo Mariani, Riccardo Lodo, Keigo Matsuyama, Yoji Kunihashi, Taro Wakamura, Satoshi Sasaki, Louis Smet, Makoto Kohda, Junsaku Nitta, Haruki Sanada
Abstract: Uniformity in the excitonic spectrum is a key requirement for accessing intrinsic excitonic physics in two-dimensional semiconductors; however, in supported transition-metal dichalcogenide (TMD) monolayers, exciton energies and linewidths can vary spatially due to inhomogeneities created by contact with other materials or contamination left by fabrication procedures. Suspended TMD monolayers provide an effective route to minimizing substrate-induced disorder. Here we demonstrate the spatially uniform excitonic spectrum from high-quality WSe2 suspended monolayers fabricated by gold-assisted exfoliation directly onto an Au contact electrode of a gate-tunable device. The resulting membranes span narrow suspended regions up to ~80 um and show spatially uniform photoluminescence at cryogenic temperatures with neutral-exciton linewidths as low as ~4.5 meV, comparable to the narrowest values reported for high-quality monolayers. Spectral reproducibility across the suspended regions supports an intrinsic optical response, while gate-dependent measurements resolve multiple excitonic species. This approach provides a practical route to electrically tunable potential landscapes in suspended TMD monolayers with a highly uniform excitonic response.

Title: Generalized Geometric Brownian motion and the Infinite Ergodicity concept
Authors: S. Giordano, R. Blossey
Abstract: We investigate stochastic processes that generalize geometric Brownian motion, focusing on cases where the standard invariant measure, i.e. the solution of the stationary Fokker-Planck equation does not necessarily exist. We demonstrate that the existence of such a measure depends sensitively on the structure of the drift and diffusion terms, as well as on the chosen discretization scheme of the underlying stochastic dynamics. To ground our discussion, we draw motivation from phenomenological models in statistical theories of turbulence, where geometric Brownian motion serves as a classical example. To address situations where the standard invariant measure fails to exist, we heuristically explore the concept of infinite ergodicity, a notion recently introduced in the context of statistical physics for drift-diffusion stochastic processes.

Title: Ising Model with Power Law Resetting
Authors: Anagha V K, Apoorva Nagar
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of the nearest-neighbour Ising model subjected to stochastic resetting, where the system is intermittently returned to an initial configuration with magnetisation $m_0$, with the inter-reset times drawn from the power law distribution $\alpha \tau_0^\alpha / \tau^{\alpha+1}$. The heavy-tailed resets generate magnetisation distributions that differ significantly from both equilibrium dynamics and the previously studied Ising model with exponentially distributed reset times. In two dimensions, for $T > T_C$, we find a quasi-ferro state for all $\alpha$, marked by a double-peaked distribution that diverges at $m=0$ and $m=m_0$; no steady state exists for $\alpha < 1$, while a stationary state emerges for $\alpha > 1$. For $T < T_C$, power law resetting produces two distinct regimes separated by a crossover exponent $\alpha^* = 1-c$: a single-peak ferromagnetic phase localised at $m_{eq}$ for $\alpha < \alpha^*$, and a dual-peak ferromagnetic phase with divergences at $m_{eq}$ and $m_0$ for $\alpha > \alpha^*$. Analytic results in one and two dimensions, supported by simulations, yield a rich phase diagram in the $(T,\alpha)$ plane and reveal how heavy-tailed resetting generates nonequilibrium phases very different from those seen in the case of exponential resetting.

Title: Anomalous transport in the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou model: a review and open problems
Authors: Stefano Lepri, Roberto Livi, Antonio Politi
Abstract: This review provides an up-to-date account of energy transport in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) chains, a key testbed for nonequilibrium statistical physics. We discuss the transition from the historical puzzle of thermalization to the discovery of anomalous heat transport, where the effective thermal conductivity $\kappa$ diverges with system size $L$ as $\kappa \propto L^\delta$. The article clarifies the distinction between two universality classes: the FPUT-$\alpha \beta$ model, characterized by $\delta = 1/3$ and linked to Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) physics, and the symmetric FPUT-$\beta$ model, where numerical and theoretical evidence support $\delta = 2/5$. We investigate how finite-size effects - unavoidably induced by the thermostatting protocols - can disguise the asymptotic scaling. Additionally, we analyze the role of conservative noise in preserving hydrodynamic properties and examine how proximity to integrable limits leads to long-lived quasi-particles and, thereby, to diffusive regimes over intermediate spatial scales.

Title: Reactive Coarse Grained Force Field for Metal-Organic Frameworks applied to Modeling ZIF-8 Self-Assembly
Authors: Sangita Mondal (1), Cecilia M. S. Alvares (2), Rocio Semino (1) ((1) Sorbonne Université, CNRS, Physico-chimie des Electrolytes et Nanosystèmes Interfaciaux, PHENIX, Paris, France, (2) Department of Chemistry, University of Warwick, Coventry, United Kingdom)
Abstract: Decoding the self-assembly mechanism of metal-organic frameworks is a crucial step in reducing trial-and-error tests in their synthesis protocols. Atomistic simulations have proven essential in revealing molecular-level features of MOF nucleation, but they still exhibit limitations in the simulation setups due to size constraints (inability of reaching realistic concentrations or exploring non-stoichiometric metal:ligand ratios). In this contribution, we develop a methodology to derive reactive coarse grained force fields based on multiscale coarse graining methods. We apply our novel methodology to the case of the archetypal zeolitic-imidazolate framework ZIF-8. Our coarse grained force field, which we call nb-CG-ZIF-FF, does not contain any explicit connectivity information, but learns the tetrahedral Zn-connectivity from many body correlations within an atomistic benchmark. nb-CG-ZIF-FF quantitatively reproduces the features of bulk, crystalline ZIF-8 as well as the structural evolution of pre-nucleation species in terms of Zn n-fold coordination populations from the atomistic benchmark. While the range of rings that are formed along the synthesis process are well captured by nb-CG-ZIF-FF, the model cannot exactly reproduce ring populations. Our reactive CG force field fitting approach can be applied to any MOF, opening new research avenues in modeling MOF formation, decomposition, defect dynamics and phase transition processes.

Title: The physics of crêpes: Elasto-gravity control of soft folding
Authors: Tom Marzin, Barath Venkateswaran, Yuchen Xi, Sunghwan Jung, P.-T. Brun
Abstract: Like a crêpe resting on a plate, a thin elastic sheet can fold smoothly under its own weight, forming reversible shapes without creases or imposed hinges. Such soft folds arise from a balance between elastic bending and gravity, yet their stability, packing limits, and dynamics remain poorly understood. Here we show that these behaviors are governed by a single physical length scale, the elasto-gravity length $\ell_{eg}$. Using experiments and heavy-elastica theory, we demonstrate that $\ell_{eg}$ sets the characteristic fold geometry, determines when a fold becomes unstable and unfolds, and limits how many reversible folds can be stacked in rectangular and circular sheets. In particular, when lengths are rescaled by $\ell_{eg}$, fold shapes and stability thresholds collapse across materials and thicknesses. We further show that unfolding follows a universal speed scaling $v \sim \sqrt{g\,\ell_{eg}}$, revealing a gravity-controlled time scale for the release of stored bending energy. Together, these results establish a unified physical framework for reversible folding, compact storage, and gravity-assisted deployment of thin elastic sheets.

Title: Topological Scaling of Nonlinear Injection current and the Quantized Circular Photogalvanic Effect (CPGE)in tilted multi Weyl semimetals(mWSMs)
Authors: Deepannita Das, Alestin Mawrie
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory of nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents in multi-Weyl semimetals subjected to a uniform magnetic field. Using the Landau-level spectrum of a tilted multi-Weyl Hamiltonian with arbitrary monopole charge $\nu$ as a starting point, we formulate a Kubo-type nonlinear response theory in the Landau-level basis and derive the second-order conductivity tensor. We identify distinct contributions originating from chiral-chiral, chiral-bulk, and bulk-bulk optical transitions, revealing characteristic monopole-charge scaling and sharp resonant structures governed by Landau-level selection rules and tilt-induced asymmetry. In the untilted limit, closed-form analytical expressions emerge that expose universal frequency thresholds and provide clear experimental signatures of higher-order Weyl topology. Our results establish nonlinear magneto-optical injection currents as a direct transport probe of chiral Landau levels and multi-Weyl topological charge.

Title: Engineering interactions shape in resonantly driven bosonic gas
Authors: Damian Włodzyński, Krzysztof Sacha
Abstract: In systems with fast periodic driving, there are special subsets of (resonant) states, which behavior can be described with effective, time-independent Hamiltonian in a rotating reference frame. Here, we show that experimentally feasible system of ultracold bosonic atoms on a ring with rapidly oscillating scattering length can be used to simulate time-independent two-component atomic mixture with exotic, long-range interactions.

Title: Origin of a shallow electron pocket: $β$-band in Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$ studied by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy

Abstract: We investigated the electronic structure of Co-intercalated 2H-TaS$_2$ using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES). In the compound Co$_{1/3}$TaS$_2$, the main electronic bands closely resemble those of pristine 2H-TaS$_2$, with no clear signs of band folding. However, a shallow electron pocket, referred to as the $\beta$-feature, was detected at the Fermi level near the corner of the superlattice Brillouin zone. The surface vs bulk origin of this feature is debated, as it cannot be reproduced using standard DFT calculations. To resolve this, we employed cluster perturbation theory (CPT) to incorporating an exact treatment of strong electron correlations (U) on the cobalt sites, going beyond DFT+U approximation. To further substantiate this, we studied an underdoped sample, Co$_{0.22}$TaS$_2$, where a reduced charge transfer leads to different Co orbital character near the Fermi level. We find that its electronic structure closely resembles that of undoped 2H-TaS$_2$, and crucially, lacks the $\beta$-feature. Our results demonstrate that the $\beta$-feature is of the bulk origin emerging from the strong electronic correlations where both the Co charge state and long-range crystallographic order play an important role. This work highlights the need for accurate treatment of electron correlations when studying intercalated transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures in two dimensions: a lowest-order constrained variational approach
Authors: Pietro Cordioli, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri
Abstract: We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.

Title: Neel temperature and helical spin order of altermagnetic RuO2
Authors: Markus Meinert
Abstract: The magnetic groundstate of RuO$_2$ remains controversial, with experimental evidence for a nonmagnetic groundstate of ideal bulk material and indications of a magnetic state in strained thin films. Here, I investigate the Néel temperature of the (hypothetical) altermagnetic state of bulk RuO$_2$, stabilized via the DFT$+U$ technique, by mapping on a Heisenberg Hamiltonian. The Néel temperature scales monotonously with the magnetic moment up to the point where a large $+U$ term opens a band gap and turns RuO$_2$ semiconducting. The maximum Néel temperature obtained by this procedure is 408\,K at $U=3$\,eV, and much smaller values for smaller $U$. A reciprocal-space eigenvalue analysis reveals a helimagnetic groundstate of the spin model due to intra-sublattice antiferromagnetic coupling. This situation resembles the isostructural $\beta$-MnO$_2$, which is a prototype helimagnet. Further comparison with calculations on CrO$_2$ and altermagnetic MnF$_2$ taking $U$ as an adjustable parameter supports the validity of the spin model analysis.

Title: Ambipolar doping-induced surface in-gap state on Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$
Authors: M. Horio, T. Wada, V. Granata, R. Fittipaldi, A. Vecchione, J. Chang, I. Matsuda
Abstract: We report an x-ray photoemission spectroscopy study of Ca$_2$RuO$_4$ surface-dosed with Cs alkali atoms and C$_{60}$ molecules. Due to its small ionization energy (large electron affinity), deposited Cs atoms (C$_{60}$ molecules) are expected to provide a solid surface with electrons (holes). Upon dosing the dopants to Mott-insulating Ca$_2$RuO$_4$, we found a new Ru $3d$ photoemission peak emerging on the lower binding-energy side, suggesting the creation of a core-hole screening channel associated with coherent Ru $4d$ states around the Fermi level. For both the Cs and C$_{60}$ dosing, this change occurred without an appreciable chemical potential jump. The coherent state, therefore, develops within the Mott gap through hybridization with the impurity level of the dopants. The present work highlights the flexibility of Mott-insulator surfaces as a playground for metal-insulator transitions.

Title: Generalized local potential functional embedding theory of localized orbitals
Authors: Wafa Makhlouf, Bruno Senjean, Emmanuel Fromager
Abstract: In this work we introduce a generalized flavor, in the sense of generalized Kohn-Sham density functional theory (gKS-DFT), of the recently derived local potential functional embedding theory (LPFET) [J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2025, 21, 20, 10293], where the in-principle exact formalism of DFT is combined with that of density matrix embedding theory (DMET). In generalized LPFET (gLPFET), the embedding clusters are designed from a full-size gKS system where the (in-principle non-local) Hartree-Fock exchange potential is combined with a local (in the localized orbital representation) correlation potential. The latter is optimized self-consistently such that gKS and local embedding cluster's densities match. Unlike in DMET, which uses the same (global) chemical potential value in all clusters, each embedded orbital has its own chemical potential in gLPFET. We show analytically that, when electron correlation is strongly local, the latter potential becomes a simple functional of the correlation potential. Numerical calculations on model systems confirm the high accuracy of gLPFET in this regime, in contrast to DMET. Moreover, we show that gLPFET completely fixes the flaw of LPFET in weaker correlation regimes, through its appropriate description of the Hartree-exchange potential.

Title: Deformation and orientation of a capsule with viscosity contrast in linear flows: a theoretical study
Authors: Paul Regazzi, Marc Leonetti
Abstract: We develop a perturbation theory to study the shape and the orientation of an initially spherical capsule of radius R with a viscosity contrast, a surface tension {\sigma} and a bending rigidity $\kappa$ in linear flows. The elastic mechanical response of membrane to deformations is described by three elastic constitutive law which are either Hookean, Neohookean or Skalak type leading to the introduction of a surface shear elastic modulus $G_s$ and the Poisson ratio (or analog quantities). At the leading order, the deformation, i.e. the so-called Taylor parameter is proportional to the elastic capillary number Ca which evaluates the ratio between the external viscous stress and the elastic membrane response. In this linear regime, the results do not depend on the elastic constitutive law as expected. Without surface tension and bending rigidity, we recover the results of Barthes-Biesel & Rallison (1981) and notably the fact that the Taylor parameter does not depend on the viscosity contrast $\lambda$ contrary to the case of a viscous droplet. In our more general model, the deformation does no longer depend on $\lambda$ at the upper order. Now, the Taylor parameter also depends on two other dimensionless numbers: the surface elastocapillary ratio $\sigma/G_s$ and the dimensionless bending rigidity $B= \kappa/G_sR^2$. At the further order, the angle of inclination of the capsule with the direction of the shear flow, the analog of the Chaffey and Brenner equation for droplets is determined in each case. The results are in excellent agreement with the numerical ones performed with a code based on the boundary integral method providing an useful method to valid numerical developments.

Title: Fastest first-passage time for multiple searchers with finite speed
Authors: Denis S. Grebenkov, Ralf Metzler, Gleb Oshanin
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the mean fastest first-passage time (fFPT) to an immobile target for an ensemble of $N$ independent finite-speed random searchers driven by dichotomous noise and described by the telegrapher's equation. In stark contrast to the well-studied case of Brownian particles -- for which the mean fFPT vanishes logarithmically with $N$ -- we uncover that the mean fFPT is bounded from below by the minimal ballistic travel time, with an exponentially fast convergence to this bound as $N \to \infty$. This behavior reveals a dramatic efficiency advantage of physically realistic, finite-speed searchers over Brownian ones and illustrates how diffusive macroscopic models may be conceptually misleading in predicting the short-time behavior of a physical system. We extend our analysis to anomalous diffusion generated by Riemann-Liouville-type dichotomous noises and find that target detection is more efficient in the superdiffusive regime, followed by normal and then subdiffusive regimes, in agreement with physical intuition and contrary to earlier predictions.

Title: Planar Structures of Medium-Sized Gold Clusters Become Ground States upon Ionization
Authors: Mohammad Ismaeil Safa, Ehsan Rahmatizad Khajehpasha, Stefan Goedecker
Abstract: This study investigates the structural stability of ionized gold clusters of sizes ranging from 22 to 100 atoms, contrasting compact, cage and planar structures. While it is well known that neutral clusters in the upper part of this size range predominantly favor compact structures, our results reveal that positively ionized gold clusters exhibit structural transitions in which planar structures become energetically preferred once the charge is sufficiently large. In addition, we study the finite-temperature stability of the structures and find that thermodynamic effects further stabilize planar configurations relative to their compact counterparts. To explore the potential energy surface, we use the Minima Hopping algorithm combined with a machine-learned potential. Since the machine-learned potential does not apply to ionized clusters, we introduce a charge-correction term to incorporate Coulomb interactions and charge screening.

Title: Self-phoretic oscillatory motion in a one-dimensional channel
Authors: Leah Anderson, David S. Dean
Abstract: We study a simple model for a particle that is active due to self-phoresis and that has been proposed to model symmetric camphor grains. The particle generates a concentration field through the continuous emission of a chemical substance, and its motion is driven by gradients of this field as it diffuses within a confined channel whose ends perfectly reflect the chemical. The reflection of the chemical field leads to an effective confinement of the particle, which itself is reflected before encountering the channel ends. The system displays a transition from a passive state, where the particle rests at the channel midpoint, to an active state characterized by highly regular, non-chaotic oscillations. We analytically construct the phase diagram and derive the oscillation frequency and amplitude in the vicinity of the transition. A perturbative analysis perfectly describes the dynamics of the particle even for oscillations as large as half the channel size. Furthermore, we develop an analysis which explains the mechanism of particle reflection close to the channel edges in the regime of large activity.

Title: Quantum Coulomb Liquids of Different Rank in the Breathing Pyrochlore Antiferromagnet
Authors: Lasse Gresista, Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Matthias Vojta, Simon Trebst, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Emergent gauge fields and Coulomb liquids have long been central to the physics of frustrated pyrochlore magnets, yet their realization beyond conventional, i.e. rank-1 $U(1)$, spin ice and into fully quantum higher-rank regimes has remained elusive. Here we provide a controlled demonstration of this physics in the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the breathing pyrochlore lattice with symmetry-allowed Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interactions, using the pseudofermion functional renormalization group. We show that tuning the breathing asymmetry stabilizes extended quantum analogues of both rank-1 and rank-2 $U(1)$ Coulomb liquids within a single microscopic model, directly distinguished by their characteristic pinch-point morphologies in momentum space. This provides the first controlled quantum realization in three dimensions where gauge theories of different rank emerge within a single microscopic spin Hamiltonian. In addition, quantum fluctuations qualitatively reshape the classical nearest-neighbor atlas of phases, causing an incommensurate spiral instability and an extended quantum-disordered regime without dipolar order, both absent from the classical model. Our results establish the breathing pyrochlore as a timely and experimentally relevant platform where higher-rank gauge constraints, conventional magnetic order, and fluctuation-driven quantum phases compete on equal footing, opening a direct route to diagnosing emergent gauge structure in three-dimensional quantum magnets.

Title: Entropy production reveals hidden dynamical constraints rather than stochastic disorder
Authors: Patrick Romanescu
Abstract: Entropy production is often interpreted as a proxy for microscopic disorder or environmental roughness in stochastic systems. We test this interpretation using controlled simulations of overdamped stochastic dynamics on curved surfaces in which local noise, geometry, and forces are held fixed while global constraints are varied. Trajectories are generated for particles evolving toward a central attractor, and entropy production is quantified using both a continuum probability-current estimator and coarse-grained Markov transition statistics across multiple spatial and temporal resolutions. Across systematic sweeps of timestep size, domain extent, and boundary topology, entropy production is governed primarily by constraint-induced probability flow rather than local stochastic variability. Periodic domains that permit sustained circulation yield substantially higher entropy production than reflecting domains despite identical local stochastic structure, with the magnitude of the separation depending on domain extent. In contrast, coarse-grained estimates decrease as temporal resolution increases and rise with finer spatial binning, demonstrating that discrete estimates depend strongly on observation scale and may fail to resolve topology-induced irreversible structure. Ergo, entropy production is not a direct measure of environmental roughness or randomness. Instead, it quantifies how strongly system dynamics are driven away from reversibility by global constraints, geometry, and the space of allowed trajectories. Interpreted in this way, entropy production maps function as diagnostics of organized probability flow and provide a principled method for detecting hidden dynamical constraints from trajectory data alone.

Title: Flexoelectricity-driven softening of bend elasticity leads to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a polar fluid
Authors: Aitor Erkoreka, Josu Martinez-Perdiguero, Luka Cmok, Ema Hanžel, Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Richard J. Mandle, Nerea Sebastián, Alenka Mertelj
Abstract: The origin of recently observed spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in polar fluids is an unsolved problem, and poses fundamental questions as to how heliconical structures emerge in systems composed of achiral molecules. We report on the softening of bend elasticity close to such phase transition, showing that flexoelectric coupling between the electric polarization and the bend deformation is the responsible mechanism, presumably arising from the bent shape of the constituent highly polar molecules.

Abstract: Fast directional solidification during Laser Additive Manufacturing (LAM) produces a complex microstructure in nickel-based superalloys, comprising columnar grains with cellular sub-grain structures and carbides. Using non-destructive Scanning 3D X-ray Diffraction (S3DXRD), we reveal spatially complex orientation and intergranular strain relationships that couple strongly to processing-induced cellular sub-grain networks and a primary cubic metal carbide (MC) phase. We have examined 3D orientation and elastic strain tensor fields across 82 $\gamma$ grains together with the spatial distribution of over 37,000 MC carbides in an ABD-900AM alloy sample manufactured by the Directed Energy Deposition (DED) LAM process. Carbides are spatially associated with the cellular sub-grain network with a weak but present orientation relationship with their parent $\gamma$ grains. The MC carbides, known to be Ti, Ta and Nb rich, form in regions of high solute segregation, resulting in a significant volumetric lattice parameter patterning in the associated $\gamma$ phase regions. These chemically distinct solute-rich regions possess a higher associated elastic modulus compared to intercellular regions and determine the local residual stress patterning. These results provide the first non-destructive 3D study of the relationship between rapid solidification-induced segregation, deformation heterogeneity and carbide architectures in an additively manufactured Ni-based superalloy. The insights provide crucial detail to rationalise LAM process parameter optimisation and the coupled spatially governed structural performance.

Title: A sequence of elastic patterns in a sheared bent sheet
Authors: D. Gimeno, B. K. Meghwar, G. Fisher, R. S. Hutton, E. Hamm, J. A. Hanna
Abstract: We document a sequence of bifurcations and elastic patterns in sheared bent sheets of intermediate aspect ratio. The sheets undergo inversion of curvature through the passage of localized features, often in S-shaped pairs. Nested force-displacement hysteresis loops provide experimental evidence for snaking. Several mechanisms for coarsening and refinement of the patterns are observed, including splitting, merging, and escape through open boundaries. While most forces, including that required for full snap-through, scale with the length of the sheet, the initial drop in force upon pattern nucleation decreases rapidly with length.

Title: Three-Dimensional Optical-Electrical Simulation of Cs2AgBiBr6 Double Perovskite Solar Cells
Authors: Md Shanian Moed, Adnan Amin Siddiquee, Md Tashfiq Bin Kashem
Abstract: Despite significant advances in lead-free perovskite photovoltaics, achieving a balance among environmental safety and high optoelectronic performance remains challenging. The inorganic double perovskite Cs2AgBiBr6 has emerged as a promising candidate owing to its robust three-dimensional crystal structure and suitable visible-range bandgap. However, best power conversion efficiencies (PCEs) for Cs2AgBiBr6 solar cells reported so far - 6.37% experimentally and 27.78% in numerical studies - remain below the theoretical performance potential, largely due to suboptimal charge transport layers, and interface-related recombination losses. Here, we address this gap using a 3D finite-element method (FEM) implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics, which couples optical simulations with semiconductor drift-diffusion transport. To our knowledge, this work represents the first comprehensive 3D FEM-based study of a double halide perovskite solar cell. Screening of 25 electron transport layer (ETL)-hole transport layer (HTL) combinations identifies CeO2 and P3HT as the optimal ETL and HTL respectively. Device performance is further analyzed through systematic variation of layer thicknesses, doping concentrations and defect densities within the FTO/CeO2/Cs2AgBiBr6/P3HT/Au architecture. Under optimized parameters, the simulated device achieves a PCE of 31.76%, representing the theoretical upper bound predicted by the model. Overall, this work demonstrates 3D physics-based device engineering as a decisive pathway for overcoming efficiency bottlenecks in lead-free double perovskite photovoltaics.

Title: Polarization-resolved measurement of forward volume spin waves by micro-focused Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Krzysztof Szulc, Mengying Guo, Ondřej Wojewoda, Hongyu Wang, Dominik Pavelka, Jan Klíma, Jakub Krčma, Xiufeng Han, Qi Wang, Michal Urbánek
Abstract: We show how the micro-focused BLS signal of forward volume spin waves is formed and why it remains observable despite symmetry-based "suppression" expectations. A reciprocity-theorem based model with vectorial diffraction-limited focusing identifies the nonnegligible longitudinal focal-field component as the key element responsible for BLS sensitivity in the forward volume geometry. We further demonstrate that full polarization analysis, implemented through polarizer-analyzer maps of coherently excited spin waves, provides information beyond the conventional crossed polarizer-analyzer readout. In a BiYIG thin film, the measured maps exhibit Stokes/anti-Stokes polarization asymmetries and nontrivial patterns that stem from quadratic magneto-optical coupling terms. Fitting the data with a model including Voigt and Cotton-Mouton contributions yields an effective Cotton-Mouton constant and shows that the quadratic response is comparable to the linear Voigt contribution.

Title: Correlated electronic states at a ferromagnetic oxide interface
Authors: D. Jones, A. Weh, A. Östlin, D. Braak, T. Kopp, P. Seiler, U. Eckern, L. Chioncel
Abstract: We propose a minimal tight-binding model for the electronic interface layer of the LaAlO$_3$/SrTiO$_3$ heterostructure with oxygen vacancies. In this model, the effective carriers are subject to oxygen vacancy induced magnetic impurities. Both the effects of random on-site potentials and Zeeman-like exchange interactions between correlated carriers and magnetic impurities are taken into account. By applying the combined coherent potential approximation (CPA) and dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) for a ferromagnetic state, we uncover a disordered Fermi-liquid regime for the majority-spins and a low energy scale which controls the transport of the minority-spin carriers, both induced by the magnetic impurities.

Title: Displacement general solutions in strain gradient elasticity: review and analysis
Authors: Y. Solyaev, E. Hamouda, S. Sherbakov
Abstract: In this work, we provide an overview of general solutions for displacement fields in static problems of isotropic strain gradient elasticity (SGE). We not only review existing solutions but also derive new representations, showing that all classical elasticity solutions - including those of Boussinesq-Galerkin, Papkovich-Neuber, Naghdi, Lame, Love and Boussinesq - can be simply generalized to SGE framework. In general, it is shown that SGE enables the use of any classical general solution representation combined with a Helmholtz decomposition for the gradient part of the displacement field. Consistency is also established between the presented Papkovich-Neuber representation and the general solutions of SGE proposed previously by Mindlin (1964), Lurie et al. (2006) and Charalambopoulos et al. (2020). Furthermore, we establish the relationships between the stress functions of different general solutions and show their completeness.

Title: Surface Block Identity Controls Transport of Symmetric Diblock Copolymer Through Nanopores
Authors: Sang Yup Lee, Tae-Young Heo, Uiseok Hwang, Theophile Ienn, Julien Bernard, Robert A Riggleman, Daeyeon Lee
Abstract: Understanding how polymer architecture governs transport through nanopores is essential for nanocomposite fabrication, membrane design, and polymer upcycling. However, the effect of the nanoscale structure of copolymers on chain transport through nanoporous media remains poorly understood. In this study, we demonstrate that simply inverting the surface orientation of lamellar poly(styrene-block-2-vinylpyridine) (PS-b-P2VP) diblock copolymers, composed of two monomers with strongly contrasting affinities for SiO2, at the entrance of nanoporous silica significantly alters the kinetics of capillary rise infiltration. Using in situ spectroscopic ellipsometry, we find that infiltration of symmetric PS-b-P2VP into silica nanoparticle (SiO2 NP) packings is significantly faster when the P2VP domain is the top layer of the film and first contacts the nanoparticles, compared to when the PS domain is the top layer. Coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations reveal that this difference originates from block-specific adsorption pathways that reorganize the nanophase structure around nanoparticles: P2VP-first infiltration forms thin adsorbed layers that drive PS into the pore interiors, generating continuous interfacial pathways that enable rapid, interface-mediated transport. In contrast, PS-first infiltration produces thicker P2VP layers that isolate PS domains and disrupt pathway connectivity, forcing chains to rely on a slower, connectivity-limited transport mechanism through P2VP-rich interstitial regions. Above the order-disorder transition, or upon silanizing nanoparticles to neutralize surface affinity, the rate difference disappears. These findings demonstrate how the interplay between nanoscale domain configuration and polymer-surface affinity governs infiltration dynamics, providing mechanistic insight into tuning transport in nanostructured block copolymers.

Title: Transferable Learning of Reaction Pathways from Geometric Priors
Authors: Juno Nam, Miguel Steiner, Max Misterka, Soojung Yang, Avni Singhal, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Identifying minimum-energy paths (MEPs) is crucial for understanding chemical reaction mechanisms but remains computationally demanding. We introduce MEPIN, a scalable machine-learning method for efficiently predicting MEPs from reactant and product configurations, without relying on transition-state geometries or pre-optimized reaction paths during training. The task is defined as predicting deviations from geometric interpolations along reaction coordinates. We address this task with a continuous reaction path model based on a symmetry-broken equivariant neural network that generates a flexible number of intermediate structures. The model is trained using an energy-based objective, with efficiency enhanced by incorporating geometric priors from geodesic interpolation as initial interpolations or pre-training objectives. Our approach generalizes across diverse chemical reactions and achieves accurate alignment with reference intrinsic reaction coordinates, as demonstrated on various small molecule reactions and [3+2] cycloadditions. Our method enables the exploration of large chemical reaction spaces with efficient, data-driven predictions of reaction pathways.

Title: Enhancing Diffusion-Based Sampling with Molecular Collective Variables
Authors: Juno Nam, Bálint Máté, Artur P. Toshev, Manasa Kaniselvan, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli, Ricky T. Q. Chen, Brandon Wood, Guan-Horng Liu, Benjamin Kurt Miller
Abstract: Diffusion-based samplers learn to sample complex, high-dimensional distributions using energies or log densities alone, without training data. Yet, they remain impractical for molecular sampling because they are often slower than molecular dynamics and miss thermodynamically relevant modes. Inspired by enhanced sampling, we encourage exploration by introducing a sequential bias along bespoke, information-rich, low-dimensional projections of atomic coordinates known as collective variables (CVs). We introduce a repulsive potential centered on the CVs from recent samples, which pushes future samples towards novel CV regions and effectively increases the temperature in the projected space. Our resulting method improves efficiency, mode discovery, enables the estimation of free energy differences, and retains independent sampling from the approximate Boltzmann distribution via reweighting by the bias. On standard peptide conformational sampling benchmarks, the method recovers diverse conformational states and accurate free energy profiles. We are the first to demonstrate reactive sampling using a diffusion-based sampler, capturing bond breaking and formation with universal interatomic potentials at near-first-principles accuracy. The approach resolves reactive energy landscapes at a fraction of the wall-clock time of standard sampling methods, advancing diffusion-based sampling towards practical use in molecular sciences.

Title: Full-Field Damage Monitoring in Architected Lattices Using In situ Electrical Impedance Tomography
Authors: Akash Deep, Andrea Samore, Alistair McEwan, Andrew McBride, Shanmugam Kumar
Abstract: Electrical impedance tomography (EIT) enables non-invasive, spatially continuous reconstruction of internal conductivity distributions, providing full field sensing beyond conventional point measurements. Here, we report the first in situ implementation of EIT within a tunable architected lattice materials framework, enabling systematic exploration across a broad lattice design space while achieving real time monitoring of damage evolution, including early stage, prefracture events, in 3D printed multifunctional lattice composites. Lattices are designed via Voronoi based branch trunk branch motifs inspired by 2D wallpaper symmetries and fabricated using CNT infused photocurable resins, with nanoscale filler dispersion confirmed by field emission scanning electron microscopy. Sixteen electrodes distributed along the lattice periphery enable EIT measurements during quasi static tensile loading. Conductivity maps reconstructed using adjacent and across current injection schemes resolve sequential ligament fracture with high temporal resolution, with localised conductivity loss quantitatively coinciding with fracture sites, including regions remote from electrodes. Architectural tunability allows systematic control of EIT imaging sensitivity to early stage damage, while pronounced resistance discontinuities at failure further corroborate spatial localisation; global end to end resistance measurements complement macroscopic stress strain responses. Collectively, these results establish in situ EIT as a scalable, full field sensing modality for architected multifunctional materials, providing an experimentally validated pathway toward autonomous, intelligent materials and data rich material states that can inform digital twin frameworks for structural, biomedical, and energy related applications.

Title: Exact Solutions to Matrix Models and String Theories: The Local Construction
Authors: Jasper Kager, João Rodrigues, Ricardo Schiappa, Maximilian Schwick, Noam Tamarin
Abstract: Exact nonperturbative solutions to hermitian one-matrix models, their topological string duals, as well as their double-scaling limits to multicritical and minimal string theories, may be obtained via the use of resurgent transseries. These solutions are generically resonant, entailing both eigenvalues and anti-eigenvalues, or, equivalently, both D-branes and negative-tension D-branes -- but are otherwise intricate to write down, having been previously addressed on a case-by-case approach. This work shows how there is a general and rather compact way to write down all these exact and fully nonperturbative transseries solutions in closed-form, immediately starting from the spectral geometry of the matrix model or string theory at hand, in the form of a discrete Fourier or Zak transform for their partition functions. This structure is inherently associated to the existence of anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes. The validity of these solutions is testable across all values of the parameters -- from weak to strong 't Hooft coupling, from small to large N; equivalently, from semi-classical to deeply quantum regimes -- and many such nonperturbative tests are performed against diverse examples ranging from matrix models to non-critical strings, fully validating our analytical and exact expressions. In particular, anti-eigenvalues or negative-tension D-branes are absolutely required to find sharp numerical matches. In order to study these solutions globally across their phase diagrams, however, complete non-linear Stokes data is still needed -- which will be addressed in a complementary follow-up paper.

Title: Bringing calorimetry (back) to life
Authors: Faezeh Khodabandehlou, Christian Maes, Édgar Roldán
Abstract: Micro-calorimetry offers significant potential as a quantitative method for studying the structure and function of biological systems, for instance, by probing the excess heat released by cellular or sub-cellular structures, isothermal or not, when external parameters change. We present the conceptual framework of nonequilibrium calorimetry, and as illustrations, we compute the heat capacity of biophysical models with few degrees of freedom related to ciliar motion (rowing model) and molecular motor motion (flashing ratchets). Our quantitative predictions reveal intriguing dependencies of the (nonequilibrium) heat capacity as a function of relevant biophysical parameters, which can even take negative values as a result of biological activity.

Title: High-throughput screening and mechanistic insights into solid acid proton conductors
Authors: Jonas Hänseroth, Max Großmann, Malte Grunert, Erich Runge, Christian Dreßler
Abstract: Proton-conducting solid acids could enable water-free operation of high-temperature fuel cells. However, systematic materials screening has, hitherto, been computationally prohibitive. Here, we introduce a two-stage high-throughput screening strategy that directly computes proton diffusion coefficients, enabled by machine-learned interatomic potentials fine-tuned to ab initio data. Starting from more than six million materials, our screening -- based on structural motifs rather than empirical descriptors -- identifies $27$ high-performing proton conductors, including over ten previously unexplored compounds. These include sustainable and commercially available materials, candidates that have not yet been synthesized, organic systems that fall outside conventional design rules, and known proton conductors that validate our approach. Importantly, our findings reveal a universal oxygen--oxygen distance of approximately $2.5$~Å at the moment of proton transfer across diverse chemistries, providing mechanistic insight and showing that macroscopic proton conductivity emerges from the interplay between anion rotational dynamics, hydrogen-bond network connectivity, and proton-transfer probability.

Title: A Robust Truncated-Domain Approach for Cone--Jet Simulations in Electrospinning and Electrospraying
Authors: Ghanashyam K. C., Satyavrata Samavedi, Harish N Dixit
Abstract: Direct numerical simulations of electrospinning and electrospraying are computationally demanding due to large-scale separation between the needle and the tip-to-collector distance. The cone-jet mode that occurs in the vicinity of the needle arises from a delicate balance between surface tension, viscous stresses, inertia, and electric stresses. This mode has a central role in determining the subsequent instabilities of the jet and the eventual outcomes on the collector. Truncated-domain simulations offer a viable alternative but depend critically on the accuracy of far-field electrostatic boundary conditions. Existing truncated-domain approaches based on analytical expressions for the electric potential systematically underestimate the electric field near the needle tip and require empirical tuning informed by prior experiments or full-domain simulations, thereby limiting their predictive capability. Here, we present a general truncated-domain framework for electrohydrodynamic (EHD) simulations of the cone-jet mode that avoids these limitations. Our approach exploits inexpensive full-domain electrostatic simulations to obtain the exact electric field and potential distributions near the needle, which are then imposed as boundary conditions in an EHD simulation carried out on a truncated domain. Comparisons with full-domain EHD simulations and experimental data demonstrate that the proposed approach accurately reproduces cone-jet shapes as well as key physical quantities, including electric currents, charge distributions, velocity fields, and Maxwell stresses, while converging at substantially smaller domain sizes. The formulation eliminates tunable parameters, does not require prior knowledge of the cone-jet configuration, and significantly reduces computational cost, providing a reliable and predictive framework for studying electrohydrodynamic cone-jet flows.

Title: Cluster Ising quantum batteries can mimic super-extensive charging power
Authors: Anna Pavone, Federico Luigi Cavagnaro, Matteo Carrega, Riccardo Grazi, Dario Ferraro, Niccolò Traverso Ziani
Abstract: Quantum batteries, miniaturized devices able to store and release energy on demand, are promising both because their intrinsic energy and time scales can match those of other quantum technologies and due to the intriguing possibility of achieving super-extensive charging power. While this enhanced scaling is known to appear in several settings, it is generally believed to be forbidden in Wigner-Jordan integrable spin chains charged via quantum-quench protocols. Here, we show that an extended cluster-Ising model, despite belonging to the above category, exhibits super-extensive charging power over wide ranges of system sizes, reaching up to a thousand spins, in proper parameter regimes. This remarkable anomalous scaling is due to a corresponding super-extensive growth of the stored energy, implying that it occurs at large but finite size and cannot persist in the thermodynamic limit. This phenomenon appears robust against finite-temperature effects.

Title: Quantum Reservoir Computing for Statistical Classification in a Superconducting Quantum Circuit
Authors: J. J. Prieto-Garcia, A. G. del Pozo-Martín, M. Pino
Abstract: We analyze numerically the performance of Quantum Reservoir Computing (QRC) for statistical and financial problems. We use a reservoir composed of two superconducting islands coupled via their charge degrees of freedom. The key non-linear elements that provide the reservoir with rich and complex dynamics are the Josephson junctions that connect each island to the ground. We show that QRC implemented in this circuit can accurately classify complex probability distributions, including those with heavy tails, and identify regimes in correlated time series, such as periods of high volatility generated by standard econometric models. We find QRC to outperform some of the best classical methods when the amount of information is limited. This demonstrates its potential to be a noise-resilient quantum learning approach capable of tackling real-world problems within currently available superconducting platforms. We further discuss how to improve our QRC algorithm in real superconducting hardware to benefit from a much larger Hilbert space.

Title: Observing quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved spacetime using programmable quantum processors
Authors: Brendan Rhyno, Bastien Lapierre, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi, Ramasubramanian Chitra
Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from Néel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.

Title: A unified theory of feature learning in RNNs and DNNs
Authors: Jan P. Bauer, Kirsten Fischer, Moritz Helias, Agostina Palmigiano
Abstract: Recurrent and deep neural networks (RNNs/DNNs) are cornerstone architectures in machine learning. Remarkably, RNNs differ from DNNs only by weight sharing, as can be shown through unrolling in time. How does this structural similarity fit with the distinct functional properties these networks exhibit? To address this question, we here develop a unified mean-field theory for RNNs and DNNs in terms of representational kernels, describing fully trained networks in the feature learning ($\mu$P) regime. This theory casts training as Bayesian inference over sequences and patterns, directly revealing the functional implications induced by the RNNs' weight sharing. In DNN-typical tasks, we identify a phase transition when the learning signal overcomes the noise due to randomness in the weights: below this threshold, RNNs and DNNs behave identically; above it, only RNNs develop correlated representations across timesteps. For sequential tasks, the RNNs' weight sharing furthermore induces an inductive bias that aids generalization by interpolating unsupervised time steps. Overall, our theory offers a way to connect architectural structure to functional biases.

Title: Generalized GMP Algebra for Three-Dimensional Quantum Hall Fluids of Extended Objects
Authors: Giandomenico Palumbo
Abstract: We develop a geometric framework for three-dimensional quantum Hall fluids of extended objects (quasi-strings) in the presence of a strong three-form background field associated with a bundle gerbe. In the strong-field regime, fast internal dynamics is frozen and the low-energy kinematics is governed by generalized guiding-center variables consisting of vectorial and tensorial coordinates. We show that these guiding-center variables obey a noncommutative geometry giving rise to a three-dimensional generalization of the Girvin-MacDonald-Platzman (GMP) algebra for projected density operators. Moreover, we relate this algebra to the canonical quantization of a topological BF+BB theory whose level is identified with the Dixmier-Douady invariant. Our results clarify the structure of incompressible quantum Hall-type phases and their geometric and topological features in three spatial dimensions.

Title: Temperley-Lieb modules and local operators for critical ADE models
Authors: Yacine Ikhlef, Alexi Morin-Duchesne
Abstract: We investigate critical restricted solid-on-solid models associated to Dynkin diagrams of type $A$, $D$ and $E$, with fixed, periodic and twisted periodic boundary conditions. These models are endowed with an action of the diagrams of the Temperley-Lieb category. For each model, we obtain the decomposition of the state space as a direct sum of irreducible modules over the Temperley-Lieb algebra $\mathsf{TL}_N(\beta)$ or its periodic incarnation $\mathsf{\mathcal EPTL}_N(\beta)$. This allows us to recover the known conformal partition functions for these models in the continuum scaling limit. For each irreducible factor arising in the decompositions, we define an associated local operator on the lattice, which behaves like a connectivity operator. Using knowledge from the Temperley-Lieb representation theory at roots of unity, we show that these operators satisfy certain linear difference relations, which are lattice counterparts of the singular-vector relations in conformal field theory.

Title: Dynamic twisting and imaging of moiré crystals
Authors: Qixuan Zhang, Lingyuan Lyu, Sneh Pancholi, Ziying Yan, Trevor Senaha, Ruolun Zhang, Chen Wu, Leonard W. Cao, Jason Tresback, Andrew Dai, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Daniel E. Parker, Monica T. Allen
Abstract: Moiré superlattices in stacked 2D crystals are powerful platforms for engineering correlated and topological quantum phases, with twisted graphene and transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) as prominent examples. Their angle-sensitive band structures enable rich tunability; however, conventional tear-and-stack methods fix the angle at assembly, limiting systematic exploration of angle-dependent phenomena. Here, we present a scanning-probe-based manipulation scheme that enables in situ, continuous post-fabrication twist control using nanostructured metal rotors. We demonstrate reproducible angle tuning and direct moiré imaging across three platforms: graphene, hBN, and encapsulated, air-sensitive MoTe2. Quantitative piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) analysis confirms sub-degree precision with minimal induced heterostrain, preserving sample quality even in the marginally twisted regime. Crucially, the device architecture maintains open access to the active region, allowing optical, scanning-probe, and transport measurements. This work enables single-device mapping of the angular phase diagram of moiré materials, including the twisted TMD homobilayers.

Title: Signatures of Quantum Phase Transitions in Driven Dissipative Spin Chains
Authors: Mostafa Ali, Naushad A. Kamar, Alireza Seif, Mohammad Maghrebi
Abstract: Open driven quantum systems have defined a powerful paradigm of nonequilibrium phases and phase transitions; however, quantum phase transitions are generically not expected in this setting due to the decohering effect of dissipation. In this Letter, we consider a quantum Ising model subject to bulk dissipation (at rate $\Gamma$) and show that, although the correlation length remains finite (hence no phase transition), it develops a pronounced peak close to the ground-state quantum critical point. While standard techniques fail in this regime, we develop a versatile analytical approach that becomes exact with vanishing dissipation ($\Gamma\to 0$ but finite $\Gamma t$). On a technical level, our approach builds on previous work where the state of the system is described by a slowly evolving generalized Gibbs ensemble that accounts for the integrability of the Hamiltonian while treating dissipation perturbatively. Finally, we demonstrate a kind of universality in that integrability-breaking perturbations of the Hamiltonian lead to the same behavior. To this end, we first show that the steady state of a chaotic Ising Hamiltonian under local Markovian dissipation that preserves the Ising symmetry, and in the limit $\Gamma \to 0$, is identical to that of quench dynamics in the absence of dissipation. This intriguing connection then allows us to draw on recent findings about quantum phase transition signatures in quench dynamics.

Title: Interedge backscattering in time-reversal symmetric quantum spin Hall Josephson junctions
Authors: Cajetan Heinz, Patrik Recher, Fernando Dominguez
Abstract: Using standard tight-binding methods, we investigate a novel backscattering mechanism taking place on quantum spin Hall N'SNSN' Josephson junctions in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. This extended geometry allows for the interplay between two types of Andreev bound states (ABS): the usual phase-dependent ABS localized at the edges of the central SNS junction \emph{and} phase-independent ABS localized at the edges of the N'S regions. Crucially, the latter arise at discrete energies $E_n$ and mediate a backscattering process between opposite edges on the SNS junction, yielding gap openings when both types of ABS are coherently coupled. In this scenario, a 4$\pi$-periodic ABS decouples from the rest of the 2$\pi$-periodic spectrum, yielding several observable consequences: Firstly, we show that the $4\pi$-periodic spectrum can be probed by means of the Shapiro experiment even in the presence of dynamical transitions between the ABS and the quasicontinuum. Secondly, the presence of this backscattering mechanism distorts the superconducting quantum interference (SQI) pattern within the length scale, determined by the ratio between $4\pi$- and $2\pi$-periodic supercurrent contributions. Finally, we propose to use a magnetic flux to tune $E_n$ to zero, resulting in the selective lifting of the fractional Josephson effect.

Title: The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, Majorana strong zero modes and SPT phases
Authors: Juliane Graf, Federica Maria Surace, Marcus Berg, Sergej Moroz
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection operation with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. In an open geometry of the studied model, we identify two regimes that exhibit different degeneracy patterns. We discuss whether this is a manifestation of distinct fermion symmetry-protected topological orders protected by the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry.

Title: Fermi-Liquid $T^2$ Resistivity: Dynamical Mean-Field Theory Meets Experiment
Authors: Fabian B. Kugler, Jeremy Lee-Hand, Harrison LaBollita, Lorenzo Van Muñoz, Jason Kaye, Sophie Beck, Alexander Hampel, Antoine Georges, Cyrus E. Dreyer
Abstract: Direct-current resistivity is a key probe for the physical properties of materials. In metals, Fermi-liquid (FL) theory serves as the basis for understanding transport. A $T^2$ behavior of the resistivity is often taken as a signature of FL electron-electron scattering. However, the presence of impurity and phonon scattering as well as material-specific aspects such as Fermi surface geometry can complicate this interpretation. We demonstrate how density-functional theory combined with dynamical mean-field theory can be used to elucidate the FL regime. We take as examples SrVO$_{3}$ and SrMoO$_{3}$, two moderately correlated perovskite oxides, and establish a precise framework to analyze the FL behavior of the self-energy at low energy and temperature. Reviewing published low-temperature resistivity measurements, we find agreement between our calculations and experiments performed on samples with exceptionally low residual resistivity. This comparison emphasizes the need for further theoretical, synthesis, and characterization developments in these and other FL materials.

Title: Linking the pressure dependence of the structure and thermal stability to α- and \b{eta}-relaxations in metallic glasses

Abstract: Glasses derive their functional properties from complex relaxation dynamics that remain enigmatic under extreme conditions. While the temperature dependence of these relaxation processes is well-established, their behavior under high-pressure conditions remains poorly understood due to significant experimental difficulties. In this study, we employ cutting-edge experimental techniques to probe the pressure evolution of the relaxation spectrum in a Zr46.8Ti8.2Cu7.5Ni10Be27.5 metallic glass across gigapascal pressure ranges. Our findings reveal two distinct relaxation mechanisms under high pressure: In the \b{eta}-relaxation regime, compression drives the system with reduced atomic mobility and enhanced structural disorder, without significant density changes. Conversely, {\alpha}-relaxation under pressure promotes density-driven structural ordering that improves thermal stability. Notably, the transition between these regimes occurs at a constant T/Tg,P ratio, independent of applied pressure. These results provide crucial insights for decoupling the competing structural and relaxation contributions to glass stability, establishing a systematic framework for tailoring glass properties through controlled thermo-mechanical processing.

Title: Quasi-particle residue and charge of the one-dimensional Fermi polaron
Authors: Giuliano Orso, Lovro Barišić, Ekaterina Gradova, Frédéric Chevy, Kris Van Houcke
Abstract: We consider a mobile impurity coupled to an ideal Fermi gas in one spatial dimension through an attractive contact interaction. We calculate the quasi-particle residue $Z$ exactly, based on Bethe Ansatz and diagrammatic Monte Carlo methods, and with varational Ansatz up to one particle-hole excitation of the Fermi sea. We find that the exact quasi-particle residue vanishes in the thermodynamic limit as a power law in the number of particles, consistent with the Luttinger-liquid paradigm and the breakdown of Fermi-liquid theory. The variational Ansatz, however, predicts a finite value of $Z$, even in the thermodynamic limit. We also study how the presence of the impurity affects the density of the spin-up sea by calculating the pair correlation function. Subtracting the homogeneous background and integrating over all distances gives the charge $Q$. This charge turns out to grow continuously from 0 at zero coupling to 1 in the strong-coupling limit. The varational Ansatz predicts $Q=0$ at all couplings. So, although the variational Ansatz has been shown to be remarkably accurate for the energy and the effective mass, it fails even qualitatively when predicting $Z$ and the pair correlation function in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Spontaneously Formed Orientation Polarization Thin Films for Engineering Organic-Organic Interfaces
Authors: Masaki Tanaka, Rena Sugimoto, Nobuhumi Nakamura
Abstract: Spontaneous orientation polarization (SOP) of polar molecules is formed in vacuum-deposited films by tilting their permanent dipole moment against the substrate surface direction. In this study, we developed SOP molecules with high structural asymmetry by introducing multiple fluoroalkyl groups into polar molecules because SOP is driven by asymmetric intermolecular interactions on the film surface during the vacuum deposition. The developed polar molecules exhibited high dipole orientation degrees in vacuum-deposited films and achieved a high surface potential growth rate relative to the film thickness, over -350 mV nm-1, which is a record high for the reported compounds. Furthermore, the dipolar layers introduced at organic thin-film interfaces in hole-only devices and organic photovoltaics to study the impact of dipole interlayers on device performance. The characteristics of the device were observed to be significantly influenced by the SOP polarity, suggesting that the SOP at the organic thin-film interface plays a crucial role in charge transfer and energy level alignment. The findings of this study provide methodologies for the formation of highly anisotropic glassy films, leading to improved performance of organic devices.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.

Title: Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological insulator nanowires
Authors: Miguel F. Martínez, Adolfo G. Grushin, Jens H. Bardarson
Abstract: Crystalline topological insulator nanowires with a magnetic flux threaded through their cross section display Aharanov-Bohm conductance oscillations. A characteristic of these oscillations is the perfectly transmitted mode present at certain values of the magnetic flux, due to the appearance of an effective time-reversal symmetry combined with the topological origin of the nanowire surface states. In contrast, amorphous nanowires display a varying cross section along the wire axis that breaks the effective time-reversal symmetry. In this work, we use transport calculations to study the stability of the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations and the perfectly transmitted mode in amorphous topological nanowires. We observe that at low energies and up to moderate amorphicity the transport is dominated, as in the crystalline case, by the presence of a perfectly transmitted mode. In an amorphous nanowire the perfectly transmitted mode is protected by chiral symmetry or, in its absence, by a statistical time-reversal symmetry. At high amorphicities the Aharanov-Bohm oscillations disappear and the conductance is dominated by nonquantized resonant peaks. We identify these resonances as bound states and relate their appearance to a topological phase transition that brings the nanowires into a trivial insulating phase.

Title: Electric and spin current vortices in altermagnets
Authors: Arsen Herasymchuk, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Erik Wegner Hodt, Jacob Linder, E.V. Gorbar, Pavlo Sukhachov
Abstract: Altermagnets constitute a class of collinear magnets with momentum-dependent spin splitting and vanishing net magnetization. Direct observation of the characteristic altermagnetic spin splitting, however, remains challenging. Indirect signatures can be obtained via transport studies, which so far have only considered homogeneous driving fields. We propose to leverage nonuniform electric fields and spin density gradients to probe the shape and the spin polarization of altermagnetic Fermi surfaces via transport measurements. By using both a semiclassical Boltzmann approach and a lattice Keldysh formalism, we show that altermagnets excite swirling electric and spin currents whose profiles depend on the relative orientation of altermagnetic lobes with respect to the sample boundaries. These currents can be measured via magnetometry techniques. Unlike previous proposals considering the hydrodynamic regime of transport, swirling currents are observed even in the Ohmic regime and rely exclusively on the altermagnetic spin splitting, with no swirls observed in ferromagnets. The electric and spin current vortices predicted here provide a different altermagnetic signature in an experimentally accessible setup.

Title: Harnessing higher-dimensional fluctuations in an information engine
Authors: Antonio Patrón Castro, John Bechhoefer, David A. Sivak
Abstract: We study the optimal performance of an information engine consisting of an overdamped Brownian bead confined in a controllable, $d$-dimensional harmonic trap and additionally subjected to gravity. The trap's center is updated dynamically via a feedback protocol designed such that no external work is done by the trap on the bead, while maximizing the extraction of gravitational potential energy and achieving directed motion. We show that performance strikingly improves when thermal fluctuations in directions perpendicular to gravity are harnessed. This improvement arises from feedback cooling of these transverse degrees of freedom, along which all heat is extracted; comparable performance can be achieved even without vertical measurements. This engine design modularizes the functions of harnessing fluctuations and storing free energy, drawing a close analogy to the Szilard engine.

Title: Exact kinetic propagators for coherent state complex Langevin simulations
Authors: Thomas G. Kiely, Ethan C. McGarrigle, Glenn H. Fredrickson
Abstract: We introduce and benchmark an improved algorithm for complex Langevin simulations of bosonic coherent state path integrals. Our approach utilizes a Strang splitting of the imaginary-time propagator rather than the conventional linear-order Taylor expansion, allowing us to construct an action that incorporates higher-order terms at negligible computational cost. The resulting algorithm enjoys guaranteed linear stability independent of the imaginary-time discretization, enabling more resource-efficient simulations. We demonstrate this improved performance for single-species bosons and for two-component bosons with Rashba spin-orbit coupling.

Title: LEMONS: An open-source platform to generate non-circuLar, anthropometry-based pEdestrian shapes and simulate their Mechanical interactiONS in two dimensions
Authors: Oscar Dufour (ILM, CNRS), Maxime Stapelle (ILM, CNRS), Alexandre Nicolas (ILM, CNRS)
Abstract: To model dense crowds, the usual recourse to oversimplified (circular) pedestrian shapes and contact forces shows limitations. To help modellers overcome these limitations, we propose an open-source numerical tool. It consists of a Python library that generates 2D and 3D pedestrian crowds based on anthropometric data, and a C++ library that computes mechanical contacts with other agents and with obstacles, and evolves the crowd's configuration. Additionally, we provide an online platform with a user-friendly graphical interface for the Python library, and scripts to call the C++ library from Python. The tool enables users to implement their own decisional layer, i.e., to control the agents' choices of desired velocities.

Title: Many-Body Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction and Exciton Spin Relaxation in Atomically Thin Semiconductor Structures
Authors: Henry Mittenzwey, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: We propose a pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI) mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77$\,$K showing a bright-dark splitting in the meV range, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics
Authors: Franklin H. Cho, Y.M. Cho, Pengming Zhang, Li-Ping Zou
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) genralization of the Ginzburg-Landau theory for the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary charge current and the spin current of the magnons), and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.

Title: Electropolishing-Induced Topographic Defects in Niobium: Insights and Implications for Superconducting Radio Frequency Applications
Authors: Oleksandr Hryhorenko, Anne-Marie Valente-Feliciano, Eric M. Lechner
Abstract: Electropolishing is the premier surface preparation method for high-Q, high-gradient superconducting RF cavities made of Nb. This leaves behind an apparently smooth surface, yet the achievable peak magnetic fields fall well below the superheating field of Nb, in most cases. In this work, the ultimate surface finish of electropolishing was investigated by studying its effect on highly polished Nb samples. Electropolishing introduces high slope angle sloped-steps at grain boundaries. The magnetic field enhancement and superheating field suppression factors associated with such a geometry are calculated in the London theory. Despite the by-eye smoothness of electropolished Nb, such defects compromise the stability of the low-loss Meissner state, likely limiting the achievable peak accelerating fields in superconducting RF cavities. Finally, the impact of surface roughness on impurity diffusion is investigated which can link surface roughness to the effectiveness of heat treatments like low-temperature baking or nitrogen infusion in the vortex nucleation or hydride hypotheses. Surface roughness tends to decrease the effective dose of impurities as a result of the expansion of impurities into regions with greater internal angle. The effective dose of impurities can be protected by minimizing slope angles and step heights, ensuring uniformity.

Title: Electron-phonon coupling in magnetic materials using the local spin density approximation
Authors: Á. A. Carrasco Álvarez, M. Giantomassi, J. Lihm, G. E. Allemand, M. Mignolet, M. Verstraete, S. Poncé
Abstract: Magnetic materials are crucial for manipulating electron spin and magnetic fields, enabling applications in data storage, spintronics, charge transport, and energy conversion, while also providing insight into fundamental quantum phenomena. In numerous applications, the interaction between electrons and lattice vibrations, known as electron-phonon coupling, can be of significant importance. In that regard, we extend the EPW package to be able to interpolate the electron-phonon matrix elements combining perturbation theory and maximally localized Wannier functions. This allows to use dense momentum grids at a reasonable computational cost when computing electron-phonon-related quantities and physical properties. We validate our implementation considering ferromagnetic iron and nickel, where we explore the absence of phonon-driven superconductivity, finding that superconductivity is intrinsically suppressed. Furthermore, we evaluate the carrier resistivity at finite temperatures for both systems, considering the role of the magnetic phase in carrier transport. Our findings indicate that in the case of Fe, the primary contributor to resistivity is electron-phonon scattering. In contrast, for Ni, electron-phonon scattering constitutes less than one-third of the resistivity, underscoring a fundamental difference in the transport properties of the two systems.

Title: Néel vector controlled charge and spin transport in altermagnetic junctions
Authors: Shubham Ghadigaonkar, Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs) - magnetic materials that have spin-split bandstructure with zero net spin polarization can be classified as weak or strong depending upon the strength of altermagnetic term in the Hamiltonian. We theoretically investigate electron transport in junctions between the two AMs in strong and weak altermagnetic phases. The charge and spin conductivities are analyzed as functions of angle $\theta$ between the Néel vectors of the two AMs. In the strong AM regime, the charge conductivity vanishes as $\theta \to \pi$, while in the weak AM regime it remains finite. Introducing a normal metal (NM) between two AMs leads to Fabry-Pérot-type oscillations in charge conductivity which can be controlled by an applied gate voltage. In the strong regime, transport in AM-NM-AM junctions is dominated by up-spin electrons, whereas both spin channels contribute in the weak regime. These results highlight the potential of AM-based heterostructures for spintronic applications, such as spin filters, and quantum interference-based spintronic devices, where tunable spin-dependent transport and interference effects can be utilized in electronic devices without a need for externally applied magnetic field.

Title: Interlayer Pores Play a Limited Role in Diffusion Through Hydrated Na-MMT: Insights from a Multiscale, Experimentally Anchored Model
Authors: Yaoting Zhang, Mikaella Brillantes, Justine Kuczera, Keyvan Ferasat, Mia L. San Gabriel, Scott Briggs, Chang Seok Kim, George Opletal, Yuankai Yang, Jane Howe, Laurent K. Beland
Abstract: This study investigates interlayer diffusion dynamics in sodium montmorillonite (Na--MMT), a smectite clay widely used in environmental remediation, pharmaceutical formulations, and advanced materials. Understanding diffusion in Na--MMT is critical, yet current models often rely on fitted parameters rather than directly linking transport to microscopic structure; even when the structure is known, interlayer diffusion remains challenging to model. This motivates the development of a predictive, coarse-grained, geometry-based computational framework. Our multiscale framework couples atomistic simulations with a coarse-grained mesoscale model to quantify contributions from interlayer one-, two-, and three-water pores, as well as free pores ($>3$-water diameter), across dry densities of $0.8$--$1.3~\mathrm{g\,cm^{-3}}$. Experimentally derived platelet size distributions, polydispersity, and anisotropic transport behavior are explicitly incorporated. Results indicate that interlayer pores contribute minimally to overall water diffusion at the studied densities, with transport dominated by free pores. Predicted diffusion scaling factors closely match tritium tracer measurements when interlayer throttling is included, and the model captures the pronounced anisotropy of Na--MMT. Validation against lattice Boltzmann simulations and experiments demonstrates reliable reproduction of geometric tortuosity and pore-size distributions. Despite limitations, including rigid platelets and omission of three-water energy minima, the coarse-grained framework provides a robust platform for understanding nanoconfined diffusion. Future work will focus on refining interlayer energy landscapes and incorporating flexible platelet mechanics.

Title: Deterministic single-photon source with on-chip 5.6 GHz acoustic clock
Authors: Alexander S. Kuznetsov, Meysam Saeedi, Zixuan Wang, Kevin L. Silverman, Klaus Biermann
Abstract: Scalable solid state single-photon sources (SPSs) with triggered single-photon emission rates exceeding a few GHz would aid in the wide technological adoption of photonic quantum technologies. We demonstrate triggering of a quantum dot (QD) single photon emission using dynamic Purcell effect induced at a frequency of several GHz by acoustic strain. To this end, InAs QDs are integrated in a hybrid photon-phonon patterned microcavity, where the density of optical states is tailored by the lateral confinement of photons in um-sized traps defined lithographically in the microcavity spacer. The single-photon character of the emission form a QD in a trap is confirmed by measuring single-photon statistics. We demonstrate modulation of the QD transition energy in a trap with a frequency up to 14 GHz by monochromatic longitudinal bulk acoustic phonons generated by piezoelectric transducers. For the modulation frequency of 5.6 GHz, corresponding to the acoustic mode of the microcavity, the QD energy is periodically shifted through a spectrally narrow confined photonic mode leading to an appreciable enhancement of the QD emission due to the dynamic Purcell effect. The platform thus enables the implementation of scalable III-V-based SPSs with on-chip tunable acoustic clocks with frequencies that can exceed several GHz under continuous wave optical excitation.

Title: Critical temperatures of two dimensional magnets beyond linear spin wave theory: application to CrI$_3$, MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) and CrSBr
Authors: Varun Rajeev Pavizhakumari, Thomas Olsen
Abstract: Magnetic anisotropy is crucial for sustaining long range magnetic order in two-dimensional materials (2D) and must be taken into account by any approximate scheme for calculating critical temperatures. While 2D ferromagnets have received significant attention with regard to predicting Curie temperatures, the treatment of 2D anti-ferromagnetism has largely been restricted to classical approaches, which typically underestimate Néel temperatures. The concept of anti-ferromagnetism can be regarded as a special case of single-$Q$ magnetic order, and for such systems the critical temperature can be calculated from the magnon dispersion using either Holstein-Primakoff (HP) bosonization or Green's function-based Random Phase Approximation (RPA). Here, we study the effects of single-ion anisotropy in general single-$Q$ systems in both the HP and RPA methods. In the case of RPA, we generalize the approach to include the Callen Decoupling (CD) correction, which has previously been shown to yield good agreement with experimental Curie temperatures for 2D ferromagnets. We compare the calculated critical temperatures of CrI$_3$ (uniaxial ferromagnet), MPS$_3$ (M=Ni, Mn, Fe) (uniaxial anti-ferromagnets) and CrSBr (triaxial ferromagnet) monolayers with experimental values and find that the Green's function-based methods are much more reliable than HP and that the CD decoupling appears to be more accurate than RPA if the single-ion anisotropy is large.

Title: From One to Two Dimensions: Magnetic Phases in Weakly Coupled Spin Ladders
Authors: Mateo Cárdenes Wuttig, Andrew J. Millis
Abstract: A large variety of materials can be approximately described by means of spin-1/2 Heisenberg ladders. Here, the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) algorithm together with a previously established numerical self-consistent mean-field approximation is used to investigate the magnetic properties of spin ladders coupled in a second dimension. The full ground state phase diagram including spin-gapped, antiferromagnetic, ferrimagnetic and fully polarized phases is presented as a function of interladder and intraladder coupling and magnetic field. Measurement of the dependence of magnetization on applied magnetic field is shown to enable location of a material on the phase diagram and determination of the Hamiltonian parameters. These results provide a practical route toward identifying and characterizing magnetic materials composed of coupled spin ladders.

Title: Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions
Authors: Yixin Guo
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.

Authors: Giulia Janzen, Gaia Maselli, Juan F. Jimenez, Lia Garcia-Perez, D A Matoz Fernandez, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Robophysics investigates the physical principles that govern living-like robots operating in complex, realworld environments. Despite remarkable technological advances, robots continue to face fundamental efficiency limitations. At the level of individual units, locomotion remains a challenge, while at the collective level, robot swarms struggle to achieve shared purpose, coordination, communication, and cost efficiency. This perspective article examines the key challenges faced by bio-inspired robotic collectives and highlights recent research efforts that incorporate principles from active-matter physics and biology into the modeling and design of robot swarms.

Title: Impact of the valence band on Rydberg excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells
Authors: Niklas Scheuler, Jörg Main, Patric Rommel, Frieder Pfeiffer, Stefan Scheel, Pavel A. Belov
Abstract: The complex valence band structure of bulk cuprous oxide necessitates going beyond the parabolic approximation to precisely estimate exciton binding energies. The same is true for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells, for which many effects have been obtained so far only qualitatively within a hydrogenlike two-band model. Here, we derive the complete Hamiltonian for excitons in cuprous oxide quantum wells based on the Luttinger-Kohn model, taking into account the full complex valence band structure. Symmetry properties of the system are discussed. Numerical results based on the diagonalization of the Hamiltonian using B-spline functions reveal the energy shifts and the lifting of degeneracies due to the nondiagonal coupling terms of the complex valence band. The relative oscillator strengths of the excitonic transitions induced by circularly polarized light are also calculated.

Title: Synchronization of thermodynamically consistent stochastic phase oscillators
Authors: Maciej Chudak, Massimiliano Esposito, Krzysztof Ptaszynski
Abstract: We consider a toy model of two kinetically coupled stochastic oscillators whose dynamics is described as a Markov jump process among $N$ discrete phase states. For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization.

Title: Bridging Microscopic Constructions and Continuum Topological Field Theory of Three-Dimensional Non-Abelian Topological Order
Authors: Yizhou Huang, Zhi-Feng Zhang, Qing-Rui Wang, Peng Ye
Abstract: In this paper, we establish an explicit correspondence between continuum topological field theory and microscopic lattice constructions of three-dimensional non-Abelian topological orders. While Wilson operators defined by gauge-field holonomies represent topological excitations at long distances, we explicitly construct microscopic lattice operators that create, fuse, and shrink particle and loop excitations, derive their fusion and shrinking rules microscopically, and show how non-Abelian shrinking channels are selectively controlled through the internal degrees of freedom of loop creation operators. Crucially, we demonstrate that the lattice shrinking rules satisfy the \textit{fusion-shrinking consistency} relations previously identified at long distances, thereby establishing these relations as a general, microscopically verifiable principle. Moreover, by computing the complete excitation spectrum alongside all fusion and shrinking data microscopically, we establish a correspondence between the $\mathbb{D}_4$ quantum double lattice model and the $BF$ field theory with an $AAB$ twist and gauge group $(\mathbb{Z}_2)^3$. Through the precise microscopic construction of the $BF+AAB$ field theory, this work definitively addresses the long-standing skepticism regarding its microscopic realizability, which has persisted over the past years. Finally, our work bridges the gap between theories at long and short distances, taking a crucial step toward a more complete microscopic construction of topological data previously identified at long distances, including braiding, pentagon relations, and fusion-shrinking hexagon relations. This progress holds the potential to deepen our understanding of quantum matter across all length scales and foster collaboration between researchers from diverse fields and approaches.

Title: Giant and Oscillatory Junction Magnetoresistance via RKKY-like Spin Coupling in Spin-Gapless Mn$_2$CoAl/SiO$_2$/p-Si Heterostructures
Authors: Nilay Maji, Subham Mohanty, Pujarani Dehuri
Abstract: Here, we report spin-selective transport and exceptionally large positive junction magnetoresistance (JMR) in sputter-deposited Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures. Highly ordered inverse-Heusler Mn$_2$CoAl thin films with near-ideal XA chemical ordering (S$\approx$0.97) and a Curie temperature of $\sim$590 K are realized using magnetron sputtering process. The spin-gapless semiconducting nature of Mn$_2$CoAl is experimentally supported by a weakly temperature-dependent resistivity with a very small negative temperature coefficient of resistance ($\mathrm{TCR} \approx -4.2 \times 10^{-9}\,\Omega \cdot \mathrm{m} \cdot \mathrm{K}^{-1}$) and a nonsaturating linear magnetoresistance over a wide range of magnetic fields and temperatures. A giant positive JMR of $\sim$825% at 10 K and $\sim$134% at room temperature is observed despite the presence of only a single ferromagnetic electrode. Systematic variation of the SiO$_2$ tunnel barrier thickness reveals a reproducible oscillatory sign reversal of the JMR accompanied by a monotonic decay in magnitude. This behavior reflects thickness-dependent modulation of spin-selective tunneling mediated by phase-coherent interfacial carriers. It can be described phenomenologically by an RKKY-like functional form without invoking conventional metallic exchange interactions. These results identify Mn$_2$CoAl/native-SiO$_2$/p-Si heterostructures as robust and scalable platforms for room-temperature spin-selective transport, with potential applications in semiconductor-compatible spin filters, magnetic field sensors, and reconfigurable spintronic logic elements.

Title: Field-induced states and thermodynamics of the frustrated Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a square lattice
Authors: Andreas Honecker, M. E. Zhitomirsky, Alexander Wietek, Johannes Richter
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state and finite-temperature properties of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the square lattice in the presence of an external magnetic field. We focus on the highly frustrated regime around $J_2 \approx J_1/2$. The $h$-$T$ phase diagram is investigated with particular emphasis on the finite-temperature transition into the "up-up-up-down" state that is stabilized by thermal and quantum fluctuations and manifests itself as a plateau at one half of the saturation magnetization in the quantum case. We also discuss the enhanced magnetocaloric effect associated to the ground-state degeneracy that arises at the saturation field for $J_2=J_1/2$. For reference, we first study the classical case by classical Monte Carlo simulations. Then we turn to the extreme quantum limit of spin-1/2 where we perform zero- and finite-temperature Lanczos calculations.

Title: Multistability of graphene nanobubbles
Authors: Alexander V. Savin
Abstract: Using He, Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe atoms as a model system, it is demonstrated that graphene nanobubbles on flat substrates are multistable systems. A nanobubble can adopt multiple stable stationary states, each characterized by the number of layers $l$ within the cluster of encapsulated atoms. The layers are circular, concentrically stacked, and form an $l$-stepped pyramid with a flat top. Encapsulation of this pyramid by the graphene sheet is achieved through local stretching of the membrane: the valence bonds elongate only directly above the confined atoms. Outside this coverage zone, the sheet remains undeformed and lies flush against the substrate. The maximum number of possible layers, $l_m$, increases monotonically with the number of encapsulated atoms $N$, reaching $l_m=6$ for $N=4000$. The graphene membrane, through van der Waals interaction with the substrate, compresses the internal atomic cluster, generating pressures on the order of $P\sim 1$~GPa. Numerical simulations of thermal vibrations reveal that among all $l$-layer configurations, one ground state always exist. Upon heating, this state smoothly transitions into a layerless liquid configuration. All other stationary states transform into this ground state once a characteristic temperature $T_l$ is reached. For $N=4000$, the ground state corresponds to the four-layer packing ($l=4$). The coexistence of multiple stable states with distinct layer numbers at low temperatures leads to the absence of a universal shape for the nanobubbles. In this scenario, the height-to-radius ratio, $H/R$ is not constant and can vary from 0 to 0.28, depending on the number of layers. The commonly reported universal relation $H/R\sim 0.2$ holds only for the ground states of the system.

Title: Field-induced transitions from incommensurate to commensurate phases in helical antiferromagnets
Authors: P. T. Bolokhova, A. V. Syromyatnikov
Abstract: Heisenberg antiferromagnet with an easy-plane anisotropy is discussed in which a magnetic spiral is induced by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and/or frustration of the exchange coupling. The distortion of the spiral by small in-plane magnetic field is described analytically. It is found that the field can gradually change the vector of the magnetic structure ${\bf k}_0$ and can produce transitions between phases with incommensurate and commensurate magnetic orderings when ${\bf k}_0$ is close to ${\bf g}/n$, where ${\bf g}$ is a reciprocal lattice vector and $n$ is integer. Analytical expressions for critical fields are derived for $n=2$, 3, and 4. Application of the theory to the triangular-lattice compound $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$ is discussed alongside its potential applicability to other materials. As a by-product of the main consideration, model parameters are found which describe more accurately the full set of available experimental data suggested before for $\rm RbFe(MoO_4)_2$.

Title: Statistical Mechanics of the Sub-Optimal Transport
Authors: Riccardo Piombo, Lorenzo Buffa, Dario Mazzilli, Aurelio Patelli
Abstract: Statistical mechanics is a powerful framework for analyzing optimization yielding analytical results for matching, optimal transport, and other combinatorial problems. However, these methods typically target the zero-temperature limit, where systems collapse onto optimal configurations, a.k.a. the ground states. Real-world systems often occupy intermediate regimes where entropy and cost minimization genuinely compete, producing configurations that are structured yet sub-optimal. The Sub-Optimal Transport (SOT) model captures this competition through an ensemble of weighted bipartite graphs: a coupling parameter interpolates between entropy-dominated dense configurations and cost-dominated sparse structures. This crossover has been observed numerically but lacked analytical understanding. Here we develop a mean-field theory that characterizes this transition. We show that local fluctuations in Lagrange multipliers become sub-extensive in the thermodynamic limit, reducing the full model with strength constraints to an effective single-constraint problem admitting an exact solution in some intermediate regime. The resulting free energy is analytic in the coupling parameter, confirming a smooth crossover rather than a phase transition. We derive closed-form expressions for thermodynamic observables and weight distributions, validated against numerical simulations. These results establish the first analytical description of the SOT model, extending statistical mechanics methods beyond the zero-temperature regime.

Title: Spin Splitter and Inverse Effects in Altermagnetic Hybrid Structures
Authors: Nicolás Sigales, Tim Kokkeler, Gonzalo de Polsi, Sebastian Bergeret
Abstract: We provide a theoretical description of diffusive charge and spin transport in hybrid devices containing altermagnets. Based on recently derived drift--diffusion equations for coupled charge and spin dynamics and general boundary conditions, our approach provides a unified description of the spin-splitter effect, i.e., the conversion of charge currents into spin currents, and its inverse in terms of experimentally accessible parameters. We analyze, analytically and numerically, the spin-splitter effect, demonstrating that an injected spin accumulation generates a measurable voltage difference across the transverse direction in the altermagnet. Motivated by a recent experiment, we also analyze a nonlocal spin-valve geometry in which an altermagnetic strip injects spin into a diffusive normal metal. We derive the resulting nonlocal voltage detected by a ferromagnetic electrode as a function of the relative orientation of the N'eel vector and the ferromagnetic polarization, accounting for the main experimental findings. For this setup, we further address spin precession during diffusive transport by analyzing the spin Hanle effect. Our results provide theoretical explanations and predictions for several altermagnet hybrid structures.

Title: Scaling of poroelastic coarsening and elastic arrest in crosslinked gels
Authors: Samuel A. Safran
Abstract: Recent experiments on crosslinked gels quenched from solvent-rich to solvent-poor conditions show solvent-rich domains embedded in a gel-rich matrix. These domains coarsen and then undergo kinetic arrest at micron scales for hours, before macroscopic drainage to equilibrium over an even longer time. Motivated by these observations, we develop a minimal model that couples capillarity-driven Darcy permeation to the viscoelastic-to-elastic crossover of the polymer network. In the viscoelastic regime, the Young--Laplace boundary traction (due to surface tension) at curved solvent--gel interfaces generates an isotropic pressure gradient in the solvent pores of the gel that drives solvent flow and coarsening. In the elastic regime, the same interfacial traction is balanced by a long-ranged deviatoric (non-isotropic) stress field, and the elastic equilibrium solution yields a spatially uniform pore pressure outside a domain, eliminating the Darcy driving force and arresting coarsening. Using the kinetic criterion $t(\lambda_{\rm arrest})\sim\tau_{\rm el}$, we predict stiffness-dependent growth laws and arrest lengths. For melt-like, polymer-rich gels, $\lambda(t)\sim G^{-1/2}t^{1/4}$ and $\lambda_{\rm arrest}\sim G^{-1/2}$. For low polymer fractions where the mesh size controls transport, $\lambda(t)\sim G^{-1/3}t^{1/3}$ and $\lambda_{\rm arrest}\sim G^{-1/3}$. The predicted $G^{-1/2}$ arrest scaling for melt-like gels is consistent with measurements.

Title: Enhanced Spin Lifetime and Long-Range Spin Transport in p-Silicon using Spin Gapless Semiconductor as Ferromagnetic Injector
Authors: Nilay Maji, Subham Mohanty, Pujarani Dehuri, Garima Yadav
Abstract: Electrical spin injection and transport in silicon are central challenges for realizing semiconductor-based spintronic devices, particularly in p-type Si, where strong spin relaxation and interface effects often suppress detectable spin signals. Here, we report electrical spin injection, accumulation, and transport in lightly doped p-type silicon using the spin-gapless Heusler compound Mn$_2$CoAl as a ferromagnetic spin injector, separated from the p-Si channel by a thin MgO tunnel barrier in a lateral device geometry. Spin transport is systematically investigated through three-terminal (3-T) Hanle and four-terminal (4-T) nonlocal (NL) spin-valve and Hanle measurements. Clear Lorentzian Hanle signals are observed in the 3-T configuration from 5 K up to room temperature, yielding a spin lifetime of $\sim$0.68 ns at 300 K that increases to $\sim$4.11 ns at 5 K. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals a weak power-law dependence of the spin lifetime, indicating Bir--Aronov--Pikus--type spin relaxation mechanism. To validate genuine spin transport, NL spin-valve and Hanle measurements were performed, revealing well-defined spin-valve switching and controlled spin precession at 5 K. From NL Hanle fitting, a spin lifetime of $\sim$5.65 ns and a spin diffusion length of $\sim$0.82 $\mu$m are extracted, confirming diffusive long-range spin transport in the p-Si channel. Although NL signals diminish at elevated temperatures due to reduced interfacial spin polarization and thermal noise, the combined 3-T and 4-T results establish spin-gapless Mn$_2$CoAl as an effective spin injector for p-type silicon. These findings highlight the potential of spin-gapless semiconductors for improving spin injection efficiency and advancing Si-compatible spintronic devices.

Title: Interplay between non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermiticity: A multi-method study of non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo model
Authors: Wei-Zhu Yi, Yun Chen, Jun-Jun Pang, Hong Chen, Baigeng Wang, Rui Wang
Abstract: Non-Hermitian multichannel Kondo problems host both non-Fermi liquid and non-Hermitian physics, which provide a prototypical model to explore exotic collective quantum phenomena driven by the two different ingredients. Here, we first propose an experimental setup that realizes this model with exact channel symmetry as well as a controllable PT symmetry. Then, we perform a multi-method study of this model, focusing on the low-energy spectrum, the thermodynamic quantities, and the transport properties associated with different fixed points. Using the Bethe ansatz approach, we identify existence of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov-like state previously found in the non-Hermitian single-channel Kondo model. Then, based on non-Hermitian numerical renormalization group calculations, we reveal clear numerical signatures of the Yu-Shiba-Rusinov state emerging in the relatively strong non-Hermiticity regime of the PT-asymmetric model. Furthermore, our boundary conformal field theory, which is found to be applicable for the PT-symmetric model, uncovers an anomalous temperature dependence of the Kondo conductance, which is beyond conventional Hermitian Kondo systems.

Title: Self-similar inverse cascade from generalized symmetries
Authors: Yuji Hirono, Kohei Kamada, Naoki Yamamoto, Ryo Yokokura
Abstract: We investigate the role of generalized symmetries in driving non-equilibrium and non-linear phenomena, specifically focusing on turbulent systems. While conventional turbulence studies have revealed inverse cascades driven by conserved quantities integrated over the entire space, such as helicity in three spatial dimensions, the influence of higher-form symmetries, whose conserved charges are defined by integration over subspaces, remains largely unexplored. We demonstrate a novel mechanism where higher-form symmetries naturally induce a self-similar inverse cascade. Taking axion electrodynamics with non-linear topological interaction as a paradigmatic example, we show that the conserved charge associated with its 1-form symmetry drives the system toward large-scale coherent structures through a universal scaling behavior characterized by analytically determined scaling exponents. Our findings suggest that higher-form symmetries can provide a fundamental organizing principle for understanding non-equilibrium phenomena and the emergence of coherent structures in turbulent systems.

Title: On the principal eigenvectors of random Markov matrices
Authors: Jacob Calvert, Frank den Hollander, Dana Randall
Abstract: We analyze the invariant distributions of continuous-time and discrete-time random walks on randomly weighted complete digraphs. These distributions correspond to the principal left eigenvectors of the associated random Markov generators and kernels, viewed as random matrices. While much is known about the spectra of these matrices, relatively little is known about the principal left eigenvectors, which are delicate random objects for which no explicit form is known. We consider a broad class of such matrices obtained by associating random weights to the vertices and edges of the complete digraph. Our main result concerns the total variation distance between the invariant distribution of the continuous-time random walk and the distribution that is inversely proportional to the vertex weights. It states that, if the edge weights are i.i.d. with a finite $p$-th moment for some $p>4$, then this distance a.s. converges to zero as the number of vertices grows large, even when the vertex weights are heavy-tailed. We further answer a question of Bordenave, Caputo, and Chafaï by showing that, despite the dependence of the entries in the corresponding Markov kernel, its invariant distribution is asymptotically uniform a.s., so long as the edge weights have a finite second moment.

Title: Fundamentals of Trapped Ions and Quantum Simulation of Chemical Dynamics
Authors: Guido Pagano, Wojciech Adamczyk, Visal So
Abstract: Trapped atomic ions are among the most advanced platforms for quantum simulation, computation, and metrology, offering long coherence times and precise, individual control over both internal and motional degrees of freedom. In this review, we present a pedagogical introduction to trapped-ion systems, covering the physics of ion trapping, qubit encodings, and laser-ion interactions. We explain how spin-dependent forces generated by light fields enable both analog and digital quantum simulations of spin and spin-boson models, as well as high-fidelity quantum logic gates. We then highlight an emerging frontier in the simulation of chemical dynamics, summarizing recent experiments that demonstrate the capability of trapped ions to simulate vibronic models and excitation-transfer processes. Finally, we outline future directions in quantum simulation and discuss open challenges in scaling up trapped-ion architectures.

Title: Electrically-gated laser-induced spin dynamics in magneto-electric iron garnet at room temperature
Authors: T.T. Gareev, N.E. Khokhlov, L.Körber, A. P. Pyatakov, A. V. Kimel
Abstract: Ultrafast pump-probe imaging reveals that the efficiency of optical excitation of coherent spins waves in epitaxial iron garnet films can be effectively controlled by an external electric field at room temperature. Although a femtosecond laser pulse alone does not excite any pronounced coherent spin oscillations, an electrical gating with the field of 0.5 MV/m dramatically changes the outcome in a laser-induced launching of spin waves. The effect, demonstrated under room-temperature conditions, is estimated to be orders of magnitude larger than in magnetic van der Waals semiconductors observed at 10 K. This electrical gating of laser-induced spin dynamics enriches opto-magnonics with a new tool and thus opens up a new avenue in fundamental and applied magnonics research.

Title: A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease
Authors: Shih-Huan Huang, Matthew W. Cotton, Tuomas P.J. Knowles, David Klenerman, Georg Meisl
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.

Title: Graphical model for factorization and completion of relatively high rank tensors by sparse sampling
Authors: Angelo Giorgio Cavaliere, Riki Nagasawa, Shuta Yokoi, Tomoyuki Obuchi, Hajime Yoshino
Abstract: We consider tensor factorizations based on sparse measurements of the components of relatively high rank tensors. The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.

Title: Learning Pseudorandom Numbers with Transformers: Permuted Congruential Generators, Curricula, and Interpretability
Authors: Tao Tao, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: We study the ability of Transformer models to learn sequences generated by Permuted Congruential Generators (PCGs), a widely used family of pseudo-random number generators (PRNGs). PCGs introduce substantial additional difficulty over linear congruential generators (LCGs) by applying a series of bit-wise shifts, XORs, rotations and truncations to the hidden state. We show that Transformers can nevertheless successfully perform in-context prediction on unseen sequences from diverse PCG variants, in tasks that are beyond published classical attacks. In our experiments we scale moduli up to $2^{22}$ using up to $50$ million model parameters and datasets with up to $5$ billion tokens. Surprisingly, we find even when the output is truncated to a single bit, it can be reliably predicted by the model. When multiple distinct PRNGs are presented together during training, the model can jointly learn them, identifying structures from different permutations. We demonstrate a scaling law with modulus $m$: the number of in-context sequence elements required for near-perfect prediction grows as $\sqrt{m}$. For larger moduli, optimization enters extended stagnation phases; in our experiments, learning moduli $m \geq 2^{20}$ requires incorporating training data from smaller moduli, demonstrating a critical necessity for curriculum learning. Finally, we analyze embedding layers and uncover a novel clustering phenomenon: the top principal components spontaneously group the integer inputs into bitwise rotationally-invariant clusters, revealing how representations can transfer from smaller to larger moduli.

Abstract: The Fermi-Hubbard model is the starting point for the simulation of many strongly correlated materials, including high-temperature superconductors, whose modelling is a key motivation for the construction of quantum simulation and computing devices. However, the detection of superconducting pairing correlations has so far remained out of reach, both because of their off-diagonal character - which makes them inaccessible to local density measurements - and because of the difficulty of preparing superconducting states. Here, we report measurement of significant pairing correlations in three different regimes of Fermi-Hubbard models simulated on Quantinuum's Helios trapped-ion quantum computer. Specifically, we measure non-equilibrium pairing induced by an electromagnetic field in the half-filled square lattice model, d-wave pairing in an approximate ground state of the checkerboard Hubbard model at $1/6$-doping, and s-wave pairing in a bilayer model relevant to nickelate superconductors. These results show that a quantum computer can reliably create and probe physically relevant states with superconducting pairing correlations, opening a path to the exploration of superconductivity with quantum computers.

Title: Spontaneous emission of a three-level artificial atom in a one-dimensional open waveguide
Authors: O. A. Chuikin, Ya. S. Greenberg, O. V. Kibis
Abstract: We study the dynamical and spectral characteristics of a quantum three-level ladder system, interacting with a continuous electromagnetic field in one-dimensional open waveguide. Common realization of such systems is a waveguide QED setup - a superconducting artificial atom (transmon), coupled to an open microwave transmission line. We derive an analytical solution for spontaneous emission of initially excited atom, and use it to study the probability of state detection and spectral density of output photon states. We find that for strong coupling of transmon to a waveguide emitted photons show correlation in frequency and can have the same energies, even if the three-level system is anharmonic.

Title: Geometry Induced Chiral Transport and Entanglement in $AdS_2$ Background
Authors: Kazuki Ikeda, Yaron Oz
Abstract: We study the real-time chiral dynamics of Dirac fermions in AdS$_2$ and AdS$_2$ black hole backgrounds. The spacetime curvature generates a spin connection term, acting as an effective magnetic field and a position-dependent chiral chemical potential. This leads to strongly asymmetric wave propagation, confined within an inhomogeneous Lieb-Robinson cone. The front velocities decrease with increasing fermion mass and horizon radius. The entanglement entropy grows inside the causal cone, and it saturates due to screening/dephasing in the finite inhomogeneous chain. In dipole-dipole collision, the central bipartite entropy rises when the inward Lieb-Robinson fronts intersect, forming a bright ridge in the local entanglement profile. Charge and current correlators peak at the front arrival, providing a real-time diagnostic of chiral transport. These results establish a causality-respecting framework, linking curvature and horizons to transport and entanglement in (1+1)-dimensional fermionic matter.

Title: BEP: A Binary Error Propagation Algorithm for Binary Neural Networks Training
Authors: Luca Colombo, Fabrizio Pittorino, Daniele Zambon, Carlo Baldassi, Manuel Roveri, Cesare Alippi
Abstract: Binary Neural Networks (BNNs), which constrain both weights and activations to binary values, offer substantial reductions in computational complexity, memory footprint, and energy consumption. These advantages make them particularly well suited for deployment on resource-constrained devices. However, training BNNs via gradient-based optimization remains challenging due to the discrete nature of their variables. The dominant approach, quantization-aware training, circumvents this issue by employing surrogate gradients. Yet, this method requires maintaining latent full-precision parameters and performing the backward pass with floating-point arithmetic, thereby forfeiting the efficiency of binary operations during training. While alternative approaches based on local learning rules exist, they are unsuitable for global credit assignment and for back-propagating errors in multi-layer architectures. This paper introduces Binary Error Propagation (BEP), the first learning algorithm to establish a principled, discrete analog of the backpropagation chain rule. This mechanism enables error signals, represented as binary vectors, to be propagated backward through multiple layers of a neural network. BEP operates entirely on binary variables, with all forward and backward computations performed using only bitwise operations. Crucially, this makes BEP the first solution to enable end-to-end binary training for recurrent neural network architectures. We validate the effectiveness of BEP on both multi-layer perceptrons and recurrent neural networks, demonstrating gains of up to +6.89% and +10.57% in test accuracy, respectively. The proposed algorithm is released as an open-source repository.

Title: Two-dimensional RMSD projections for reaction path visualization and validation
Authors: Rohit Goswami (1) ((1) Institute IMX and Lab-COSMO, École polytechnique fédérale de Lausanne (EPFL), Lausanne, Switzerland)
Abstract: Transition state or minimum energy path finding methods constitute a routine component of the computational chemistry toolkit. Standard analysis involves trajectories conventionally plotted in terms of the relative energy to the initial state against a cumulative displacement variable, or the image number. These dimensional reductions obscure structural rearrangements in high dimensions and are often history dependent. This precludes the ability to compare optimization histories of different methods beyond the number of calculations, time taken, and final saddle geometry. We present a method mapping trajectories onto a two-dimensional projection defined by a permutation corrected root mean square deviation from the reactant and product configurations. Energy is represented as an interpolated color-mapped surface constructed from all optimization steps using a gradient aware derivative Gaussian Process. This representation highlights optimization trajectories, identifies endpoint basins, and diagnoses convergence concerns invisible in one-dimensional profiles. We demonstrate the framework on a cycloaddition reaction, showing that a machine-learned potential saddle and density functional theory reference lie on comparable energy contours despite geometric displacements, along with the ratification of the visualization for more complex reactions, a grignard rearrangement, and a bicyclobutadiene rearrangement.

Title: Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory
Authors: Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally-charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.

Title: Beyond Wigner: Non-Invertible Symmetries Preserve Probabilities
Authors: Thomas Bartsch, Yuhan Gai, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: In recent years, the traditional notion of symmetry in quantum theory was expanded to so-called generalised or categorical symmetries, which, unlike ordinary group symmetries, may be non-invertible. This appears to be at odds with Wigner's theorem, which requires quantum symmetries to be implemented by (anti)unitary -- and hence invertible -- operators in order to preserve probabilities. We resolve this puzzle for (higher) fusion category symmetries $\mathcal{C}$ by proposing that, instead of acting by unitary operators on a fixed Hilbert space, symmetry defects in $\mathcal{C}$ act as isometries between distinct Hilbert spaces constructed from twisted sectors. As a result, we find that non-invertible symmetries naturally act as trace-preserving quantum channels. Crucially, our construction relies on the symmetry category $\mathcal{C}$ being unitary. We illustrate our proposal through several examples that include Tambara-Yamagami, Fibonacci, and Yang-Lee as well as higher categorical symmetries.

Title: Topology and higher-order global synchronization on directed and hollow simplicial and cell complexes
Authors: Runyue Wang, Timoteo Carletti, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Higher-order networks encode the many-body interactions of complex systems ranging from the brain to biological transportation networks. Simplicial and cell complexes are ideal higher-order network representations for investigating higher-order topological dynamics where dynamical variables are not only associated with nodes, but also with edges, triangles, and higher-order simplices and cells. Global Topological Synchronization (GTS) refers to the dynamical state in which identical oscillators associated with higher-dimensional simplices and cells oscillate in unison. On standard unweighted and undirected complexes this dynamical state can be achieved only under strict topological and combinatorial conditions on the underlying discrete support. In this work we consider generalized higher-order network representations including directed and hollow complexes. Based on an in depth investigation of their topology defined by their associated algebraic topology operators and Betti numbers, we determine under which conditions GTS can be observed. We show that directed complexes always admit a global topological synchronization state independently of their topology and structure. However, we demonstrate that for directed complexes this dynamical state cannot be asymptotically stable. While hollow complexes require more stringent topological conditions to sustain global topological synchronization, these topologies can favor both the existence and the stability of global topological synchronization with respect to undirected and unweighted complexes.

Title: Refined half-integer condition on RG flows
Authors: Ken Kikuchi
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.

Title: Deconfinement from Thermal Tensor Networks: Universal CFT signature in (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theory
Authors: Adwait Naravane, Yuto Sugimoto, Shinichiro Akiyama, Jutho Haegeman, Atsushi Ueda
Abstract: Tensor networks offer a sign-problem-free approach to study lattice gauge theories, but extracting precise universal information associated with the deconfinement transition remains challenging. In this work, we study the deconfinement transition of (2+1)-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}_N$ lattice gauge theories at finite temperature using a thermal tensor network approach, where the partition functions at finite temperature are formulated as three-dimensional tensor networks. These tensor networks are first contracted in the temporal direction, and the subsequent coarse-graining in the spatial directions yields a renormalized transfer matrix, the spectrum of which directly encodes the universal conformal field theory data. In particular, by numerically extracting the central charge and scaling dimensions, we verify that the universality class of the thermal deconfinement transition matches the prediction of the Svetitsky-Yaffe conjecture for $N=2,3,5$. Moreover, we show that the $\mathbb{Z}_5$ theory at finite temperature exhibits an intermediate phase with an emergent U(1) symmetry. Critical couplings are determined via Gu-Wen ratios and agree with existing Monte Carlo simulations. Finally, extrapolating these critical couplings at finite temperature enables us to determine the deconfinement transition points for $N=2,3$ at zero temperature.

Title: Causally constrained reduced-order neural models of complex turbulent dynamical systems
Authors: Fabrizio Falasca, Laure Zanna
Abstract: We introduce a flexible framework based on response theory and score matching to suppress spurious, noncausal dependencies in reduced-order neural emulators of turbulent systems, focusing on climate dynamics as a proof-of-concept. We showcase the approach using the stochastic Charney-DeVore model as a relevant prototype for low-frequency atmospheric variability. We show that the resulting causal constraints enhance neural emulators' ability to respond to both weak and strong external forcings, despite being trained exclusively on unforced data. The approach is broadly applicable to modeling complex turbulent dynamical systems in reduced spaces and can be readily integrated into general neural network architectures.
