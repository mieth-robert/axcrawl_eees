Title: Random Trajectory Models for Complex Phenomena
Authors: Jeffrey D. Picka
Abstract: Many models for complex phenomena use a model for strongly-interacting elements on a small scale to generate larger-scale simulations of some aspects of experimental realizations. These models may be agent-based (as in the case of discrete element method models for granular flow) or based on pattern-forming systems of PDEs (as in models for Raleigh-Bènard convection patterns). Often these models are purely deterministic, producing a single simulation for each set of initial conditions. If observed realizations demonstrate between-realization variability for important aspects of the phenomenon, those aspects can be simulated by adding probabilistic components to the deterministic models to create random trajectory (RT) models. The RT model framework provides probabilistic models which can be fit to data and validated, together with a clear perspective on how difficult it can be to establish any kind of validity for a fitted model. It treats models as code with adjustable coefficients, rather than as systems of differential equations. It provides a simply stated necessary condition for these code models to be easily fit and verified, as well as an argument that this condition can almost never be checked. When the necessary condition cannot be checked, the RT model framework identifies the code models as black box models which may have the capacity for emulating the joint distributions of small collections of statistics observed on realizations, but which can only provide very weak evidence for any form of explanation for the emergence of any aspect of the phenomenon. The framework also provides a way to clearly understand why finding a useful code model and scientifically validating it may require many person-years of extra experimentation and statistical analysis undertaken after the first output-producing code model is constructed and contributed.

Title: Record High Polarization at 2V and Imprint-free operation in Superlattice HfO2-ZrO2 by Proper Tuning of Ferro and Antiferroelectricity
Authors: Xinye Li, Sayani Majumdar
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing, inspired by biological intelligence, offers a pathway to revolutionize artificial intelligence (AI) by unifying memory and processing in an energy-efficient, sustainable framework for data-intensive tasks. Ferroelectric (FE) materials have emerged as promising candidates for implementing artificial synapses, yet achieving low-voltage operation in CMOS back-end compatible devices remains a major challenge. In this work, we demonstrate that proper tuning of ferro and antiferroelectric phases in HfO2-ZrO2(HZO) superlattice based capacitors can lead to imprint-free switching with record switchable polarization (2Pr) of 76 micro Coulomb cm-2 under an external field of only 2 MV cm-1. The sizable remanent polarization of the superlattice HZO further enables linear potentiation and depression with an on to off ratio of 20 within a 3 MV cm-1 bias window. Under pulsed operation, the devices show robust endurance, either maintaining polarization with less than 10 per cent degradation up to 10^8 cycles or surviving beyond 10^9 cycles with recoverable fatigue. By elucidating two distinct fatigue mechanisms, this work highlights strategies for optimizing FE devices to meet the stringent demands of neuromorphic training applications.

Title: Transient localization from fractionalization: vanishingly small heat conductivity in gapless quantum magnets
Authors: Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Several candidate materials for gapless quantum spin liquids exhibit a vanishing thermal conductivity, which is at odds with theoretical predictions. Here, we show that a suppressed response can arise due to transient localization from fractionalization, even in the absence of extrinsic defects or disorder. Concretely, we consider a Kitaev ladder model in a uniform magnetic field, whose spin degrees of freedom fractionalize into visons and spinons. For moderate magnetic fields, visons are heavy and act as quasi-static disorder that induce transient localization of light spinons even in the translation-invariant model and at zero temperature, which strongly suppresses the residual conductivity at finite but low frequencies. At ultralow frequencies the conductivity is restored; however, such scales can be extremely hard to reach in experiments. Our results identify transient localization as a signature of fractionalization and provide a framework for interpreting anomalous transport in gapless spin liquid candidates.

Title: On the magnetization of electronic ground states in frustrated superstable graphs
Authors: F. P. M. Méndez-Córdoba, J. Tindall, D. Jaksch, F. Schlawin
Abstract: Geometric frustration lies at the heart of many unconventional quantum phases in strongly interacting electron systems. Here, we analytically determine the ground state magnetization of the half-filled Hubbard model on frustrated geometries where superstable states -- eigenstates which are robust against frustration -- are manifest. Our results apply to a broad class of lattices, including those where altermagnetic and superconducting states are known to emerge. Furthermore, they provide evidence for phase transitions involving a geometric rearrangement of magnetic correlations in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Altermagnetism revealed by polarized neutrons in MnF$_2$
Authors: Quentin Faure, Dalila Bounoua, Victor Balédent, Arsen Gukasov, V. Ovidiu Garlea, Afonso Ribeiro, Jeffrey G. Rau, Sylvain Petit, Paul McClarty
Abstract: Motivated by possible spintronics applications in antiferromagnets, it was recently observed that symmetry admits magnets that combine attractive features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. These systems, dubbed altermagnets, have been the subject of intense study with direct spectroscopic evidence, from ARPES and RIXS, techniques reported in a handful of materials in the last year. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) is one of the most powerful direct probes of magnetism and has recently been used to witness a splitting of magnon bands in MnTe that is compatible with altermagnetism although the nature and origin of the splitting remain to be fully characterized. However, the full power of neutron scattering for such systems comes from using polarized neutrons to measure the chirality of the magnon bands. Such a measurement provides a direct characterization of altermagnetism directly from the spin wave excitations. In this article, we present results on MnF$_2$ once thought to be an archetypal antiferromagnet. We present a polarized INS data that demonstrate the material is, in fact, altermagnetic. It had long been realized that the magnon bands in this material should have a weak splitting coming from the long-range dipolar coupling. Our data is the first to visualize this splitting directly. While the dipolar splitting on its own is not altermagnetic, using a domain biased sample, the data reveals a nonzero chirality in the neutron scattering cross section that reverses sign between the two magnon modes. It is this feature that clearly demonstrates altermagnetism in MnF$_2$. This finding highlights the potential for polarized INS to characterize altermagnets not least through its exquisite sensitivity to fine-structure in the magnon spectrum.

Title: The role of the density of states in Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos, Stephane Ouvry
Abstract: The onset of Bose-Einstein condensation in systems with { various} densities of states is examined, with particular attention to the role of the behavior of their {energy} spectrum at low and high energies. Specifically, the results of Chatterjee and Diaconis, which rely exclusively on the high-energy behavior, are compared and reconciled with those of the standard physics approach, where the existence of condensation is determined by the low-energy behavior.

Title: Quantum control of exciton motion in electric field
Authors: Yingjia Li, Jorge Casanova, Xi Chen, E. Ya. Sherman
Abstract: We study quantum control of classical motion of a two-dimensional exciton by optimizing the time-dependent electric field of a stripe-like gate acting on the exciton and inducing its time-dependent quantum dipole moment. We propose a search method that significantly reduces computational requirements while efficiently identifying optimal control parameters. By leveraging this method, one can precisely manipulate the exciton's final position and velocity over a specified evolution time. These results can be applied for control of exciton fluxes and population, and for spatially resolved light emission in two-dimensional semiconducting structures.

Title: Weak phonon coupling to nematic quantum critical mode in $BaFe2(As1-xPx)2$
Authors: S. Wu, D. Ishikawa, A. Q. R. Baron, A. Alatas, A. H. Said, Jiayu Guo, Y. He, X. Chen, Y. Song, J. G. Analytis, Dung-Hai Lee, R. J. Birgeneau
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the softening of the in-plane transverse acoustic phonon driven by electronic nematicity in BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$ using inelastic X-ray scattering, with a focus on the optimally doped sample ($x = 0.31$) sample, a system exhibiting signatures of a putative nematic quantum critical point and minimal disorder among iron pnictides. We observe only a modest softening of the phonon frequency and no evidence of critical damping, suggesting that the nematic quantum critical fluctuations couple only weakly to the lattice from our quantum critical model. Given the close proximity of the structural and magnetic transition temperatures in the underdoped sample, which implies that spin-nematic fluctuations couple strongly to the lattice. We conjecture that the quantum critical nematic fluctuations are predominantly orbital in origin.

Title: Kondo echo dynamics of terahertz-pumped heavy fermions
Authors: Francisco Meirinhos, Michael Turaev, Michael Kajan, Tim Bode, Johann Kroha
Abstract: We provide a theoretical framework to describe the nonequilibrium temporal dynamics of correlated electron systems for realistic system parameters and the consequent, often exponentially long time scales. It is based on an entirely integro-differential formulation of time-dependent dynamical mean-field theory, the noncrossing approximation, and the quantum representation of a driving electromagnetic field. For heavy-fermion systems, we identify two key nonequilibrium mechanisms governing their time evolution after a single-cycle terahertz excitation: transient, instantaneous shift from the Kondo toward the mixed-valence regime by an enhanced, photoassisted hybridization, and slow recovery of the heavy-fermion state due to the long Kondo coherence time. This explains recent time-resolved terahertz spectroscopy experiments microscopically and establishes the latter as a technique for direct experimental access to the Kondo coherence time and to the heavy-fermion quasiparticle weight, central for the classification of heavy-fermion quantum phase transitions.

Title: Scanned SQUID Microscope with High-speed Electrical Connectivity
Authors: Ian W. Haygood, Bochao Xu, John Biesecker, Michael L. Schneider
Abstract: We report on a scanned superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) microscope operating in a cryogen-free cryostat, with the capability of up to forty RF connections with 20 GHz bandwidth to a device under test. The system utilizes planar gradiometric DC SQUIDs, which are fully shielded except for a pair of pickup coils with radii as small as 250 nm and have on chip field coils allowing for susceptometry. The system noise is 1.3 $\mu\Phi_{0}/\sqrt{Hz}$ at the base temperature of 3.3 K. The sample temperature is variable and both magnetometry and susceptibility measurements are simultaneously possible with the sample temperature above 40 K. Through the use of a cryogenic chip socket and silicon interposer round trip RF losses to a sample are approximately 15 dB at 20 GHz. A combination of both active and passive magnetic shielding result in a residual magnetic field less than 100 nT at the sample location.

Title: 3D Mapping of Defects and Moiré Corrugations via Electron Ptychography Atomic Coordinate Retrieval
Authors: Jeffrey Huang, Yichao Zhang, Sang hyun Bae, Ballal Ahammed, Elif Ertekin, Pinshane Y. Huang
Abstract: Defects and reconstructions in 2D moiré materials cause out-of-plane deformations which strongly modify their electronic properties but are difficult to experimentally access. Here, we solve the 3D atomic coordinates of twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ with picometer-scale accuracy using multislice electron ptychography (MEP) acquired from a single orientation. The resulting atomic models individually visualize each of the six atomic planes, revealing the curvature of each WSe$_2$ layer, variations in the interlayer spacing, and the 3D locations of individual vacancies -- which lie exclusively in the outer Se planes. We also observe a new, unexpected type of structural disorder consisting of mixed bending -- and breathing-type moiré-induced corrugations that should strongly impact the emergent electronic properties. Broadly, our methods generate 3D atom-by-atom models of a 2D heterointerface from data acquired in about 30 seconds, methods that should unlock routine access to 3D atomic information in 2D systems and catalyze design methods to control out-of-plane deformations.

Title: Exploring the nature of the emergent gauge field in composite-fermion metals: A large-scale microscopic study
Authors: Amogh Anakru, Mytraya Gattu, Ajit C. Balram, Xiao-Chuan Wu, Prashant Kumar, Zhen Bi, J. K. Jain
Abstract: Field theories of the composite-fermion (CF) metal model it as a Fermi sea of composite fermions coupled to an emergent gauge field. Within a random phase approximation, these theories predict that the Landau damping of the gauge field resulting from its coupling to the low-energy, long-wavelength CF particle-hole excitations modifies the electrons' density-density correlation function related to the static structure factor $S(q)$ at wave vector $q$. This produces a non-analytic correction $\propto q^{3}\ln q$ to $S(q)$ (with the magnetic length $\ell_{B}=1$). Thanks to the recently developed quaternion formulation for Jain-Kamilla projection of CF wave functions, the evaluation of $S(q)$ from the accurate microscopic theory of composite fermions has now become possible for systems containing as many as $N=900$ CFs, which enables a reliable determination of the small-$q$ behavior of $S(q)$. We study CF metals corresponding to electrons at Landau level filling factors $\nu=1/2$ and $1/4$, and for completeness, also of bosons at $\nu=1$ and $1/3$. In the $q\rightarrow0$ limit, our microscopic calculation reveals a $q^{3}$ term in $S(q)$ of the CF metals rather than $q^{3} \ln q$. This behavior is well-predicted by a model of a non-interacting Fermi sea of dipolar CFs, which also obtains its coefficient accurately.

Title: Computational and Experimental Investigation of Chiral and Achiral 2D Organic Lead Bromide Perovskites: Octahedral Distortions and Electronic and Optical Properties
Authors: Md Mehdi Masud, Jarek Viera, Azza Ben-Akacha, Biwu Ma, David A. Strubbe
Abstract: We present a computational investigation, in conjunction with synthesis and experimental characterization, into the structural, electronic, and optical properties of layered 2D organic lead bromide perovskites. We contrast materials based on the chiral (R/S)-4-fluoro-$\alpha$-methylbenzylammonium (R/S-FMBA), which have been shown to lead to bright room-temperature circularly polarized luminescence, with the similar achiral 4-fluorobenzylammonium (FBA). Using density functional theory (DFT) with van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we study relaxed structures (compared with X-ray diffraction, XRD) and optical absorption spectra (compared with experiments), as well as bandstructure and orbital character of transitions. We develop and provide a Python code to calculate octahedral distortions and compare DFT and XRD results, finding that vdW corrections are important for accuracy and that DFT overestimates octahedral tilt angles. (FMBA)$_2$PbBr$_4$ shows among the largest tilt angle differences (often termed $\Delta \beta$) reported, $14^\circ$, indicating strong inversion symmetry-breaking which enables its chiral emission. The lowest-energy optical transitions involve the perovskite only and are polarized within the layer. This work furthers understanding of structure-property relations with applications to optoelectronics and spintronics.

Title: Fast phase prediction of charged polymer blends by white-box machine learning surrogates
Authors: Clayton Ellis, Xinyi Fang, Christopher Balzer, Timothy Quah, M. Scott Shell, Glenn H. Fredrickson, Mengyang Gu
Abstract: Compatibilized polymer blends are a complex, yet versatile and widespread category of material. When the components of a binary blend are immiscible, they are typically driven towards a macrophase-separated state, but with the introduction of electrostatic interactions, they can be either homogenized or shifted to microphase separation. However, both experimental and simulation approaches face significant challenges in efficiently exploring the vast design space of charge-compatibilized polymer blends, encompassing chemical interactions, architectural properties, and composition. In this work, we introduce a white-box machine learning approach integrated with polymer field theory to predict the phase behavior of these systems, which is significantly more accurate than conventional black-box machine learning this http URL random phase approximation (RPA) calculation is used as a testbed to determine polymer phases. Instead of directly predicting the polymer phase output of RPA calculations from a large input space by a machine learning model, we build a parallel partial Gaussian process model to predict the most computationally intensive component of the RPA calculation that only involves polymer architecture parameters as inputs. This approach substantially reduces the computational cost of the RPA calculation across a vast input space with nearly 100% accuracy for out-of-sample prediction, enabling rapid screening of polymer blend charge-compatibilization designs. More broadly, the white-box machine learning strategy offers a promising approach for dramatic acceleration of polymer field-theoretic methods for mapping out polymer phase behavior.

Title: Green's Function Methods for Computing Supercurrents in Josephson Junctions
Authors: Eduardo R. Mucciolo, Jouko Nieminen, Xiao Xiao, Wei-Chi Chiu, Michael N. Leuenberger, Arun Bansil
Abstract: Interest in Josephson junctions (JJs) has increased rapidly in recent years not only because of their use in qubits and other quantum devices but also due to the unique physics supported by the JJs. The advent of various novel quantum materials for both the barrier region and the superconducting leads has led to the possibility of adding new functionalities to the JJs. Thus, there is a growing need for accurate modeling of the JJs and related systems to enable their predictive control and atomistic level understanding. This review presents an in-depth discussion of a Green's function-based formalism for computing supercurrents in JJs. The formulation is tailored for large-scale atomistic simulations and encompasses both dc and ac supercurrents. We hope that this review will provide a timely and comprehensive reference for researchers as well as beginning practitioners interested in Green's-function-based methods to model supercurrents in JJs.

Title: Single-ion anisotropy driven chiral magnetic order in a spin-1 antiferromagnetic chain
Authors: S. Vaidya, S. P. M. Curley, P. Manuel, J. Ross Stewart, M. Duc Le, A. Hernández-Melián, T. J. Hicken, C. Wang, H. Luetkens, J. Krieger, S. J. Blundell, T. Lancaster, K. A. Wheeler, D. Y. Villa, Z. E. Manson, J. A. Villa, J. L. Manson, J. Singleton, R. D. Johnson, P. A. Goddard
Abstract: Chirality in magnetic systems gives rise to a wide range of exotic phenomena, yet its influence in $S=1$ chains remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a comprehensive experimental study of a chiral antiferromagnetic (AFM) $S=1$ chain, [Ni(pym)(H$_{2}$O)$_{4}$]SO$_{4} \cdot$ H$_{2}$O (pym = pyrimidine), where the Ni(II) octahedral orientation exhibits a four-fold chiral periodicity. Muon spin rotation measurements indicate the onset of long-range magnetic order below $T_{\rm N} = 1.82(2)\,\mathrm{K}$. Neutron diffraction measurements reveal a chiral AFM order driven by a chiral modulation of the easy-axis anisotropy direction, rather than the typical scenario of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions, geometrical frustration or higher-order interactions. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) measurements reveal dispersive spin-wave excitations well described by linear spin-wave theory, with Hamiltonian parameters $J_{0} = 6.81(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (intrachain exchange), $J'_{1\rm a} = -0.091(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (interchain exchange), and $D = -3.02(1)\,\mathrm{K}$ (easy-axis single-ion anisotropy). These parameters are further validated by Monte Carlo simulations of the magnetisation. Additionally, the INS data reveal multiple dispersionless bands, suggesting the presence of further excitations beyond the scope of our linear spin-wave theory.

Title: Ultrathin oxide freestanding membranes with large-scale continuity and structural perfection
Authors: Yuhao Hong, Yang Hu, Jianyao Zheng, Minh D. Nguyen, Jelle R. H. Ruiters, Daniel M. Cunha, Iris C. G. van den Bosch, Edwin Dollekamp, Mark Huijben, Yulin Gan, Nini Pryds, Daesung Park, Christoph Baeumer, Qinghua Zhang, Guus Rijnders, Zhaoliang Liao, Gertjan Koster
Abstract: Freestanding oxide membranes offer integration with advanced semiconductor platforms, unlocking opportunities for flexible electronics, silicon-based spintronics, neuromorphic computing, and high-performance energy technologies. Scalable fabrication of such membranes is essential for bridging fundamental discoveries in complex oxides with practical device deployment. However, the lateral dimensions of crack- and wrinkle-free membranes remain limited to millimeter scales, forming a critical bottleneck for large-area architectures. Overcoming this challenge demands strategies that preserve crystalline quality while suppressing defect transfer during release. Here, we demonstrate an approach based on a water-soluble sacrificial layer of super-tetragonal Sr4Al2O7, enabling the fabrication of ultrathin, crack-free, and wrinkle-free free-standing oxide membranes spanning centimeter-scale areas. This method is broadly applicable to a wide range of oxides and establishes a new pathway toward large-scale silicon integration and flexible oxide technologies. Nevertheless, dissolution of the sacrificial layer introduces oxygen vacancies into the SrRuO3 membranes, with diffusion depths reaching six unit cells, leading to anomalous "up-and-down" transport behavior. Although post-annealing can eliminate these vacancies, the required temperatures are incompatible with CMOS processes. Therefore, ultrathin freestanding membranes fabricated by water-assisted lift-off still face critical challenges for integration into miniaturized silicon-based oxide devices.

Title: Effective Atom Theory: Gradient-Driven ab initio Materials Design
Authors: Justin Tahmassebpur, Brandon Li, Boris Barron, Héctor Abruña, Peter Frazier, Tomás Arias
Abstract: We introduce Effective Atom Theory (EAT), a framework that transforms combinatorial materials design into a smooth, gradient-driven optimization within density functional theory (DFT). Atoms are represented as probabilistic mixtures of elements, enabling gradient-based optimizers to converge to a physically realizable material in about 50 energy evaluations -- far fewer than combinatorial optimization methods. Applied to Co-Cr-Ni-V oxides for the alkaline oxygen evolution reaction (OER), EAT leads to a final recommended composition of Co0.19Cr0.06V0.31Ni0.44O.

Title: Arrested coarsening, oscillations, and memory from a conserved phase separating nucleator in a self-straining cytoskeletal network
Authors: Quentin Bodini--Lefranc, Jakob Schindelwig, Daniel Weidinger, Lucas Engleder, Sebastian Fürthauer
Abstract: How do phase separated cellular structures set their size? To elucidate this, we study the dynamics and steady states of a phase separating nucleator that is advected by the self-straining cytoskeletal network which it nucleates. We find (i) that the interplay between transport and the tendency of nucleators to phase separate arrests coarsening; (ii) that the system undergoes damped oscillations towards a patterned steady state with a well defined length scale; (iii) that the system supports a spectrum of patterned states of different steady length scales, enabling the retention of a mechano-chemical memory of the initial conditions. Together, our findings establish a physiologically plausible compound material made of the phase separating nucleator and the self-straining network as a paradigm for mechano-chemical scale selection and memory fixation in cells.

Title: Exact large deviations and emergent long-range correlations in sequential quantum East circuits
Authors: Jimin Li, Bruno Bertini, Juan P. Garrahan, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Exploiting quantum measurements is a promising route for preparation of correlated quantum states. We use methods from large deviation theory to solve this problem exactly for a specific system: the deterministic quantum East circuit with boundary measurements. We show that conditioning on measurement outcomes generates a long-range correlated state, despite typical trajectories being trivial. We derive the channel that optimally realizes the rare measurement trajectories, and establish a formal connection with the Petz recovery (time-reversal) map. We compute one- and two-point correlation functions in the conditioned state, revealing finite two-body correlations at arbitrarily large separations, and an underlying fractal structure, related to the Sierpiński triangle. These results demonstrate explicitly how boundary measurements can be used to control bulk properties of a quantum system.

Title: Comparing unsupervised learning methods for local structural identification in colloidal systems
Authors: Alptuğ Ulugöl, Jessi Bückmann, Ruizhi Yang, Roy Hoitink, Alfons van Blaaderen, Frank Smallenburg, Laura Filion
Abstract: Quantifying local structures in self-assembled systems is a central challenge in soft matter and materials science. When no a priori knowledge of the relevant structures is available, traditional order parameters often fall short. Unsupervised machine learning provides a convenient route to autonomously uncover structural motifs directly from particle configurations. In this work, we systematically compare three popular dimensionality reduction techniques; Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Autoencoders (AE), and Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection (UMAP), for classifying local environments in self-assembled systems. We first apply these methods to fluid and crystal configurations of hard and charged spheres. Thereafter, we apply it to an icosahedral arrangement of spheres that self-assembled in spherical confinement, both from simulations as well as from experiments. We demonstrate that UMAP consistently outperforms the other methods in capturing complex structural features, offering a robust tool for structural classification without supervision.

Title: Direct determination of antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition pathways in PbZrO$_3$ with Operando Electron Microscopy
Authors: Menglin Zhu, Michael Xu, Louis Alaerts, Hao Pan, Colin Gilgenbach, Geoffroy Hautier, Lane W. Martin, James M. LeBeau
Abstract: Under a sufficiently high applied electric field, a non-polar antiferroelectric material, such as \ce{PbZrO3}, can undergo a rapid transformation to a polar ferroelectric phase. While this behavior is promising for energy storage and electromechanical applications, a complete understanding of the atomic-scale mechanisms governing the phase transition remain elusive. Here, we employ \textit{operando} scanning transmission electron microscopy electric field biasing to directly resolve the antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric transition pathway in \ce{PbZrO3} thin films under device-relevant conditions. Atomic-resolution imaging reveals a multi-step transition that includes several metastable phases. Complementary nano-beam electron diffraction and atomic scale analysis further show that this pathway and its end states can be modulated, leading to the formation of a \quotes{dead layer} near the substrate with suppressed switching behavior. Taking advantage of this depth-dependent heterogeneity, dynamic phase transformations are observed between coexisting antiferroelectric and metastable ferroelectric phases. At this dynamic transition front, repeated phase interconversion is shown to be driven by competing internal (due to substrate clamping and extended defects) and external fields, allowing the relative energies of intermediate phases to be compared as a function of electric field. This work highlights the critical role of local energetics in phase stability and provides key experimental insights into field-induced phase transitions, guiding the design of antiferroelectric-based devices.

Title: Grain Boundary Anisotropy and Its Influence on Helium Bubble Nucleation, Growth, and Decohesion in Polycrystalline Iron
Authors: Yang Zhang, Peter Hatton, Blas P. Uberuaga, Jason R. Trelewicz
Abstract: The accumulation of helium bubbles at grain boundaries (GBs) critically degrades the mechanical integrity of structural materials in nuclear reactors. While GBs act as sinks for radiation-induced defects, their inherent structural anisotropy leads to complex helium bubble evolution behaviors that remain poorly understood. This work integrates accelerated molecular dynamics simulations and a novel atomic-scale metric, the flexibility volume (V_f), to establish the interplay between GB character, helium segregation, and bubble growth mechanisms in body-centered cubic iron. We demonstrate that V_f, which incorporates both local atomic volume and vibrational properties, qualitatively predicts deformation propensity. Our results reveal that the atomic-scale segregation energy landscape dictates initial helium clustering and subsequent bubble morphology, with low-energy channels in tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary facilitating one-dimensional migration while isolated deep traps in twist {\Sigma}13 boundary promote larger, rounder bubble morphology. Critically, besides gradual bubble growth via trap mutation mechanism, we identify two distinct stress-relief mechanisms: loop punching in anisotropic tilt {\Sigma}5 boundary and interfacial decohesion in twist {\Sigma}11 boundary, with the dominant pathway determined by the interplay between bubble morphology and local mechanical softness. This study establishes a fundamental connection between GB crystallographic and energetical anisotropy and helium bubble evolution, providing critical insights for designing radiation-tolerant microstructures.

Title: Structural Phase Transition in CeMnSi under Pressure and Comparative Structural Properties of $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd)
Authors: Yukihiro Kawamura, Sae Nishiyama, Jun-ichi Hayashi, Keiki Takeda, Chihiro Sekine, Hiroshi Tanida
Abstract: Powder X-ray diffraction experiments under pressure up to $\sim$10 GPa were performed on tetragonal CeFeSi-type $R$MnSi ($R$ = La, Ce, Pr, Nd). A structural phase transition was observed in CeMnSi at a critical pressure of $P_{\rm s}$ $\sim$ 5.7 GPa. In contrast, LaMnSi, PrMnSi, and NdMnSi do not exhibit any structural transitions within the same pressure range. The lattice parameter ratio $c/a$ of CeMnSi decreases rapidly as pressure approaches $P_{\rm s}$, whereas the $c/a$ ratios of the other $R$MnSi increase monotonically with pressure. CeMnSi also shows a relatively small bulk modulus: $B_0$ $\sim$ 41.4(4) GPa in the 0--2 GPa range and $B_0$ $\sim$ 32.8(2) GPa in the 4--5 GPa range, suggesting valence instability under pressure. The structural transition in CeMnSi is attributed to the pressure-induced decrease in $c/a$ and its low bulk modulus. Above $P_{\rm s}$, the X-ray diffraction pattern indicates a transition to a monoclinic structure with space group No. 11, $P2_1/m$. These findings highlight the unique pressure response of CeMnSi and provide insight into the coupling between lattice and electronic degrees of freedom in Ce-based intermetallic systems.

Title: Examining density wave correlations in high pressure $\rm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ through variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Yanxin Chen, Haoxiang Chen, Tonghuan Jiang, Ji Chen
Abstract: $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, a nickelate compound with a reported superconducting transition temperature of $\rm 80~K$, has attracted significant attention in recent this http URL-wave phenomena arising from strong electron correlations are widely regarded as key to unraveling the superconductivity mechanism, but the ordering and stability of these density waves remain a subject of contention in existing theoretical studies. In this work, we employ the variational Monte Carlo (VMC) method to thoroughly examine the nature of density waves as functions of Coulomb repulsion and exchange interactions in bilayer two-orbital model proposed for the high pressure phase of $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$. We analyse the spin and charge correlation functions in a wide range of parameter space, and delineate a schematic phase diagram that separates different density-wave ground states. Our results provide useful insights into the understanding of electron correlations in $\rm La_3Ni_2O_7$, and highlight the potential of VMC to elucidate its superconducting mechanism.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Dielectric Function of Calcium Fluoride
Authors: T. Das, D. Alam, C. A. Ullrich, U. D. Jentschura
Abstract: Calcium fluoride (fluorspar, CaF2 ) is of consummate importance for the manufacturing of optical components. In many cases, its wide transmission band eliminates the need for antireflective coatings. It is thus of interest to study its optical properties as a function of temperature. The optical properties are mainly determined by a strongly temperature-dependent infrared (IR) peak, and a series of nearly temperature-independent ultraviolet (UV) peaks. We find that the temperature dependence of the IR peak can be modeled, to good accuracy, by a radiation-reaction improved coupled-oscillator model, with temperature-dependent parameters. For the UV peaks, we find a convenient functional form which covers both the real as well as the imaginary parts of the dielectric function and provide a comparison to first-principles calculations. The result is a compact functional form for the dielectric function of undoped CaF2 in the frequency range 0 < omega < 1.8 a.u., and in the temperature range 22Celsius < T < 500Celsius. With the help of the temperature-dependent dielectric function, we obtain temperature-dependent values of the short-range and long-range asymptotics of atom-surface interactions with CaF2, for hydrogen, as well as ground-state and metastable helium.

Title: Thermodynamic Irreversibility in Underdamped Brownian Motion with Spatial Temperature Gradients
Authors: Mesfin Taye
Abstract: We analyze underdamped Brownian motion in non-isothermal media with quadratic, linear, and piecewise-constant temperature profiles. Exact identities for entropy production and entropy extraction are derived, addressing whether a vanishing rate implies equilibrium. For a free particle (no external forces or ratchets), the instantaneous entropy production and extraction rates decay to zero at long times despite a spatial temperature gradient. However, their time-integrated values remain finite, demonstrating intrinsic irreversibility arising from kinetic-energy-mediated heat flow from hot to cold regions. Hence, zero entropy-production rate does not certify equilibrium in non-isothermal underdamped systems. Without loads/potentials, most thermodynamic rates vanish asymptotically while irreversibility persists via cumulative heat transfer.

Title: Simulation of Topological $X$-Gates via Braiding of Majorana Zero Modes in an Interacting Quantum Dot System
Authors: Bradraj Pandey, Satoshi Okamoto, Pontus Laurell, Stephan Rachel, Elbio Dagotto
Abstract: Recent advances in quantum dot platforms have opened new pathways for realizing Majorana zero modes (MZMs) and simulating topological quantum computation. Here we propose an experimentally feasible setup for implementing topological $\sqrt{X}$- and $X$-quantum gates in an interacting $Y$-shaped quantum-dot array. The proposed novel architecture enables both braiding and charge readout through simple fusion operations controlled by gate-tunable potentials. Using many-body time-dependent simulations based on exact diagonalization, we analyze the braiding and fusion dynamics of MZMs in the presence of nearest-neighbor Coulomb interactions and pairing disorder. We compute diabatic errors, braiding fidelity, and the time- and space-resolved electron and hole components of the local density of states to monitor the braiding process. Our results show that even weak interactions or pairing disorder induce oscillations in the braiding fidelity, thereby setting an upper bound on the braiding speed. Furthermore, we demonstrate that comparing fusion outcomes before and after braiding provides a direct and experimentally accessible signature of the non-Abelian nature of MZMs in quantum dot systems.

Title: Quantum Theory of Exciton Magnetic Moment: Interaction and Topological Effects
Authors: Gurjyot Sethi, Jiawei Ruan, Fang Zhang, Weichen Tang, Chen Hu, Mit Naik, Steven G. Louie
Abstract: Combining magnetometry with optical spectroscopy has uncovered novel quantum phenomena and is emerging as a platform for quantum information science. Yet, the theory of magnetic response of excitons, correlated electron-hole pairs in semiconductors, remains incomplete due to insufficient treatment of electron-hole interaction and topological effects. In biased bilayer graphene, for instance, theoretical predictions of valley g-factor for p-excitons deviate from experiment by nearly an order of magnitude. Here, we develop a quantum theory of exciton orbital magnetic moment that reveals several conceptually new terms absent in prior theories, including an unforeseen contribution from exciton band quantum geometry. Our ab initio calculations yield results in excellent agreement with measurements, establishing the importance of a full theory including interaction and topological effects for the magnetic response of excitons.

Title: High-current p-type transistors from precursor-engineered synthetic monolayer WSe$_2$
Authors: Anh Tuan Hoang, Kathryn Neilson, Kaikui Xu, Yucheng Yang, Stephanie M. Ribet, Tara Peña, Giulio D'Acunto, Young Suh Song, Anton E. O. Persson, William Millsaps, Colin Ophus, Matthew R. Rosenberger, Eric Pop, Andrew J. Mannix
Abstract: Monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) is a leading candidate for nanoscale complementary logic. However, high defect densities introduced during thin-film growth and device fabrication have limited p-type transistor performance. Here, we report a combined strategy of precursor-engineered chemical vapor deposition and damage-minimizing fabrication to overcome this limitation. By converting tungsten trioxide and residual oxyselenides into reactive suboxides before growth, and precisely regulating selenium delivery during deposition, we synthesize uniform, centimeter-scale monolayer WSe$_2$ films with charged defect densities as low as $5 \times 10^{9}$ cm$^{-2}$. Transistors fabricated from these films achieve record p-type on-state current up to $888 \mu$A$\cdot\mu$m$^{-1}$ at $V_{\mathrm{DS}}=-1$ V, matching leading n-type devices. This leap in material quality closes the p-type performance gap without exotic doping or contact materials, marking a critical step towards complementary two-dimensional semiconductor circuits.

Title: An $ab\;initio$ answer to long-debated questions about superconducting Nb$_3$Sn
Authors: Alessio Cucciari, Lilia Boeri
Abstract: We present the first fully $ab\;initio$ microscopic description of cubic and tetragonal Nb$_3$Sn. We compute the anharmonic free energy surface, phonon spectra, and solve the full-bandwidth anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations for the superconducting gap of the two phases. Our results show that anharmonic effects are crucial to stabilize both the cubic and tetragonal structures, yielding phonon spectra in excellent agreement with neutron scattering data. We find that the martensitic transition is weakly first-order and that the superconducting gap is strongly anisotropic yet fully-open, with contributions from both longitudinal and transverse Nb $d$-orbitals, revealing an unexpected three-dimensional pairing mechanism. We also find that the experimentally observed reduction of the upper critical field $H_{c2}$ across the transition is explained by a combination of overall weaker electron-phonon coupling and a redistribution of Fermi velocities, which shifts parts of the Fermi surface to longer coherence lengths and limits $H_{c2}$. Based on these insights, we propose that Sn-site doping could enhance transverse-state coupling and gap isotropy, potentially improving both $T_c$ and $H_{c2}$, while Nb-site doping reinforce $H_{c2}$ at the cost of lowering $T_c$.

Title: Coherent Transport in Two-Dimensional Disordered Potentials under Spatially Uniform SU(2) Gauge Fields
Authors: Masataka Kakoi, Christian Miniatura, Keith Slevin
Abstract: We study interference effects in the dynamics of a spin 1/2 particle propagating in two dimensions in a disordered potential and subject to a generalized spin--orbit coupling. With the particle initially in a spin-polarized plane wave state, in the short-time regime, before the spin and momentum distributions reach their steady states, we observe a transient backscattering peak offset from the exact backscattering direction, coexisting with a coherent backscattering dip. We present an intuitive explanation of this momentum offset using a non-Abelian gauge transformation. We also describe the full time evolution of the transient peak, from its buildup to its decay with a precise prediction of the dephasing time within a perturbative framework for multiple scattering. Our results can be applied to general spatially uniform SU(2) gauge fields, including the synthetic gauge field in ultracold atoms.

Title: Bayesian Prior Construction for Uncertainty Quantification in First-Principles Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Derick E. Ober, Sesha Sai Behara, Anton Van der Ven
Abstract: First-principles statistical mechanics enables the prediction of thermodynamic and kinetic properties of materials, but is computationally expensive. Many approaches require surrogate models to calculate energies within Monte Carlo or molecular dynamics simulations. Inexpensive surrogates such as cluster expansions enable otherwise intractable calculations by interpolating data from higher accuracy methods, such as Density Functional Theory (DFT). Surrogate models introduce uncertainty into downstream calculations, in addition to any uncertainty inherent to DFT calculations. Bayesian frameworks address this by quantifying uncertainty and incorporating expert knowledge through priors. However, constructing effective priors remains challenging. This work introduces and describes practical strategies for building Bayesian cluster expansions, focusing on basis truncation, hyperparameter selection, and ground state replication. We analyze multiple basis truncation schemes, compare cross-validation to the evidence-approximation for hyperparameter optimization, and provide methods to find and enforce ground-state-preserving models through priors. Additionally, we compare the uncertainties between different approximations to DFT (LDA, PBE, SCAN) against the uncertainty introduced with the use of cluster expansion surrogate models. These approaches are demonstrated on the BCC Li$_x$Mg$_{1-x}$ and Li$_x$Al$_{1-x}$ alloys, which are both of interest for solid-state Li batteries. Our results provide guidelines for constructing and utilizing Bayesian cluster expansions, thereby improving the transparency of materials modeling. The approaches and insights developed in this work can be transferred to a wide range of cluster expansion surrogate models, including the atomic cluster expansion and related machine-learned interatomic potential architectures.

Title: Spin-Orbit Coupling Effect on the Seebeck Coefficient in Dirac Electron Systems in $α$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$
Authors: Yoshikazu Suzumura, Takao Tsumuraya, Masao Ogata
Abstract: Seebeck coefficient, $S=L_{12}/(TL_{11})$, which is proportional to a ratio of the thermoelectric conductivity $L_{12}$ to the electric conductivity $L_{11}$ with $T$ being temperature is examined for two-dimensional Dirac electrons in a three-quarter filled organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$I$_3$, [BETS = BEDT-TSeF = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene] at ambient this http URL a tight-binding (TB) model obtained by first-principles relativistic density-functi onal theory method [Eur. Phys. J. B 94, 17 (2021)], we calculate $S$ in the presence of the impurity and electron--phonon (e--p) scatterings. It is shown that $S_x < 0$ and $S_y >0$ at high temperatures, where $S_x$ ($S_y$) denotes $S$ perpendicular (parallel) to the molecular stacking axis. There is a sign change of $S_y$ with increasing $T$. It is found that, at low temperatures the absolute value of $S$ is enhanced by the spin-orbit coupling. The Seebeck coefficient is examined by dividing into components of the conduction and valence bands to find that the electron and hole contributions compete each other. Such $T$ dependence of $S$ is clarified using the spectral conductivity, which determines $L_{12}$ and $L_{11}$.

Title: Anisotropic resistivity of a $p$-wave magnet candidate CeNiAsO
Authors: Honglin Zhou, Muyu Wang, Xiaoyan Ma, Gang Li, Ding-Fu Shao, Bo Liu, Shiliang Li
Abstract: Certain noncollinear antiferromagnets host momentum-dependent spin-splitting bands with odd-parity $p$-wave symmetry, termed $p$-wave magnets. Metallic $p$-wave magnets offer a unique platform for spintronic applications, yet experimental realizations remain scarce. CeNiAsO, featuring a tetragonal structure and developing a commensurate coplanar noncollinear antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures, has been theoretically proposed as such a magnet. Here, we show that its resistivity exhibits strong two-fold in-plane anisotropy -- a key signature of its proposed $p$-wave magnetism. Reversible and nonvolatile switching between high- and low-resistance states is achieved by alternating the in-plane magnetic field direction, indicating potential for field-controlled memory devices. Our results not only provide critical experimental evidence for $p$-wave magnetism in CeNiAsO but also open new avenues for high-performance antiferromagnetic spintronics based on resistivity anisotropy.

Title: Quantum Phases in Twisted Homobilayer Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Bohao Li, Wen-Xuan Qiu, Fengcheng Wu, A. H. MacDonald
Abstract: Twisted homobilayer transition metal dichalcogenides - specifically twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ and twisted bilayer WSe$_2$ - have recently emerged as a versatile platform for strongly correlated and topological phases of matter. These two-dimensional systems host tunable flat Chern bands in which Coulomb interactions can dominate over kinetic energy, giving rise to a variety of interaction-driven phenomena. A series of groundbreaking experiments have revealed a rich landscape of quantum phases, including integer and fractional quantum anomalous Hall states, quantum spin Hall states, anomalous Hall metals, zero-field composite Fermi liquids, and unconventional superconductors, along with more conventional topologically trivial correlated states including antiferromagnets. This review surveys recent experimental discoveries and theoretical progress in understanding these phases, with a focus on the key underlying mechanisms - band topology, electron interactions, symmetry breaking, and charge fractionalization. We emphasize the unique physics of twisted TMD homobilayers in comparison to other related systems, discuss open questions, and outline promising directions for future research.

Title: Alter-magnetic properties in the perovskite compounds
Authors: Sining Zhang, Zhengxuan Wang, Minping Zhang, Xilin Zhang, Guangtao Wang
Abstract: Our high-throughput computational screening of the Materials Project database has identified 140 candidate materials exhibiting antiferromagnetic behavior in the $Pnma$ space group. Through systematic density functional theory calculations comparing various magnetic configurations, we demonstrate that 91 of these compounds preferentially stabilize in altermagnetic ground states, with 20 adopting the perovskite structure. Using NaCoF$_3$ as a prototypical example, we perform a comprehensive investigation of its electronic structure, magnetic ordering, and orbital configurations. Our analysis reveals that the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions occupy the 4c Wyckoff position and support three distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, among which the $G$-AFM configuration emerges as the ground state. Detailed symmetry analysis uncovers that the inter-sublattice coupling in the $G$-AFM phase is mediated by the combined time-reversal and rotation operation $\hat{T}\{R_{2x}|\frac{1}{2}\frac{1}{2}0\}$. This unique symmetry protection gives rise to several remarkable physical phenomena: (i) anisotropic optical conductivity, (ii) prominent anomalous transport effects including the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), Nernst effect (ANE), and thermal Hall effect (ATHE), and (iii) strong magneto-optical responses manifested through both Kerr and Faraday effects.

Title: Magneto-optical Kerr-effect measurements under pulsed magnetic fields over 40 T using a compact sample fixture
Authors: Atsutoshi Ikeda, Sota Nakamura, Soichiro Yamane, Kosuke Noda, Akihiko Ikeda, Shingo Yonezawa
Abstract: Magnetic field is one of the most fundamental control parameters in materials science. Pulsed magnetic-field apparatus can generate high magnetic fields that are inaccessible by conventional DC-field magnets. One important issue is that measurement techniques compatible with pulsed fields are rather limited due to short pulse duration and large electromagnetic or mechanical noises originating from field pulses. Magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), change in states of light polarization upon reflection from magnetic materials, has potential to become a powerful tool for investigation of magnetic properties of a wide range of materials including non-transparent materials or thin films in pulsed fields. Nevertheless, since MOKE response is typically very small, MOKE measurements under pulsed fields are quite challenging. Here, we present a new method to measure polar MOKE under high pulsed magnetic fields of 2-ms pulse width. The keys of this new technique are a ferrule-based compact sample-fiber fixture and a phase-resolved numerical lock-in analysis, combined with the high-resolution optical apparatus based on an all-fiber loop-less Sagnac interferometer. We succeeded in measuring MOKE of various ferromagnetic or ferrimagnetic samples above 40 T and down to 77 K, largely extending limits of previously reported pulse-field MOKE measurements. Our apparatus is simple enough to be compatible with larger-scale experiments in pulse-field facilities, thus becoming a new promising tool to optically investigate materials properties in pulsed fields.

Title: Longitudinal spin current absorption in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic and highly-resistive non-magnetic layers
Authors: Sosuke Hori, Kohei Ueda, Junichi Shiogai, Jobu Matsuno
Abstract: Spin Hall magnetoresistance (SMR) is an intriguing spin-dependent transport phenomenon in bilayers consisting of non-magnetic and magnetic layers. Here, we report on the influence of longitudinal spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on SMR in bilayers composed of Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ (CoFeB) and epitaxial SrIrO$_{3}$, where SrIrO$_{3}$ is used as a highly-resistive spin current source. We observed a clear SMR signal and an enhancement in the SMR ratio with increasing CoFeB layer thickness, in qualitative agreement with an SMR model that incorporates the spin current absorption. The effective spin Hall angle is corrected from 0.07 to 0.12 with consideration of the spin current absorption, corresponding to a relative correction of ~71%. Our findings highlight the pronounced impact of the spin current absorption by the magnetic layer on the SMR mechanism when employing highly-resistive non-magnetic layer such as SrIrO$_{3}$, as well as other emerging quantum materials.

Title: Janus Skyrmion: Interfacial Quasiparticle with Two-Faced Helicity
Authors: Xichao Zhang, Rui Zhang, Qiming Shao, Yan Zhou, Charles Reichhardt, Cynthia J. O. Reichhardt, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: Janus particles are functional particles with at least two surfaces showing asymmetric properties. We show at the interface between two magnetic regions with different antisymmetric exchange interactions, a new species of topological quasiparticles can emerge, in which different helicity structures can coexist. We name such an interfacial quasiparticle a "Janus skyrmion", in analogy to the Janus particle. As the Janus skyrmion shows helicity asymmetry, its size could vary with both the in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. A vertical spin current could drive the Janus skyrmion into one-dimensional motion along the interface without showing the skyrmion Hall effect, at a speed which depends on both the spin polarization angle and current density. Thermal fluctuations could also lead to one-dimensional random walk of a Brownian Janus skyrmion. This work uncovers unique dynamics of interfacial quasiparticles with exotic helicity structures, which may be realized in interface-engineered magnetic layers.

Title: Benchmarking Universal Interatomic Potentials on Zeolite Structures
Authors: Shusuke Ito, Koki Muraoka, Akira Nakayama
Abstract: Interatomic potentials (IPs) with wide elemental coverage and high accuracy are powerful tools for high-throughput materials discovery. While the past few years witnessed the development of multiple new universal IPs that cover wide ranges of the periodic table, their applicability to target chemical systems should be carefully investigated. We benchmark several universal IPs using equilibrium zeolite structures as testbeds. We select a diverse set of universal IPs encompassing two major categories: (i) universal analytic IPs, including GFN-FF, UFF, and Dreiding; (ii) pretrained universal machine learning IPs (MLIPs), comprising CHGNet, ORB-v3, MatterSim, eSEN-30M-OAM, PFP-v7, and EquiformerV2-lE4-lF100-S2EFS-OC22. We compare them with established tailor-made IPs, SLC, ClayFF, and BSFF using experimental data and density functional theory (DFT) calculations with dispersion correction as the reference. The tested zeolite structures comprise pure silica frameworks and aluminosilicates containing copper species, potassium, and organic cations. We found that GFN-FF is the best among the tested universal analytic IPs, but it does not achieve satisfactory accuracy for highly strained silica rings and aluminosilicate systems. All MLIPs can well reproduce experimental or DFT-level geometries and energetics. Among the universal MLIPs, the eSEN-30M-OAM model shows the most consistent performance across all zeolite structures studied. These findings show that the modern pretrained universal MLIPs are practical tools in zeolite screening workflows involving various compositions.

Title: Temperature behavior of optical absorption spectra in HfO2 thin films
Authors: A.O. Shilov, S.S. Savchenko, A.S. Vokhmintsev, V.A. Gritsenko, I.A. Weinstein
Abstract: Hafnium dioxide, also known as hafnia, is an extremely sought-after material in opto- and nanoelectronics for creating optical coatings and various functional media to have stable performance characteristics under varying thermal operating conditions. In this paper, we have investigated the behavior of the optical properties of hafnia thin films exhibiting an amorphous structure in a wide temperature range of 7-296 K. For the first time we have examined the temperature effects in the energy gap of HfO2 films and estimated the effective phonon energy of 30 meV responsible for observed thermally assisted shift of electronic levels. It has been shown that the electron-phonon interaction in the oxygen subsystem predominantly causes the observed changes. The obtained refractive index values for the tested films are established to be compatible with independent predicted data and to decrease as the temperature drops. The energy structure and electron-phonon interaction features that have been found are critical for forecasting how hafnia-thin-film-based optoelectronic devices will behave across a wide temperature range.

Title: A set of master variables for the two-star random graph
Authors: Pawat Akara-pipattana, Oleg Evnin
Abstract: The two-star random graph is the simplest exponential random graph model with nontrivial interactions between the graph edges. We propose a set of auxiliary variables that control the thermodynamic limit where the number of vertices N tends to infinity. Such 'master variables' are usually highly desirable in treatments of 'large N' statistical field theory problems. For the dense regime when a finite fraction of all possible edges are filled, this construction recovers the mean field solution of Park and Newman, but with an explicit control over the 1/N corrections. We use this advantage to compute the first subleading correction to the Park-Newman result, which encodes the finite, nonextensive contribution to the free energy. For the sparse regime with a finite mean degree, we obtain a very compact derivation of the Annibale-Courtney solution, originally developed with the use of functional integrals, which is comfortably bypassed in our treatment.

Title: Electronic modes induced by spin and charge perturbations in Mott and Kondo insulators
Authors: Masanori Kohno
Abstract: Electronic band structures usually remain unaffected by doping via a chemical-potential shift or by increasing the temperature in conventional band insulators. In contrast, it has been shown that those of Mott and Kondo insulators can change by doping or by increasing the temperature: electronic modes are induced within the band gap, exhibiting momentum-shifted magnetic dispersion relations from the band edges. Here, by generalizing the underlying mechanism of the remarkable strong-correlation effects, this study shows that various spin and charge perturbations, including magnetization of spin-gapped Mott and Kondo insulators, can induce electronic modes. The emergent modes can change the band structure, provided that a macroscopic number of spins or charges are excited by the perturbations at a moment. The origins and dispersion relations of the emergent modes are elucidated by investigating the selection rules and using the Bethe ansatz and effective theory for weak inter-unit-cell hopping. The theoretical results are validated by numerical calculations for the one- and two-dimensional Hubbard models, periodic Anderson models, Kondo lattice models, and ladder and bilayer Hubbard models. This study significantly advances the fundamental understanding of the changes in the band structure driven by spin and charge perturbations and paves the way for band-structure engineering in strong-correlation electronics, utilizing the unconventional characteristics of strongly correlated insulators.

Authors: F. Novkoski, M. Mélard, M. Delens, F. Wéry, M. Noirhomme, J. Pande, A. Maier, A.-S. Smith, N. Vandewalle
Abstract: We present the GRASPion, a compact, open-source bristlebot designed for the controlled study of active matter systems. Built around a low-cost Arduino-compatible board and modular 3D-printed components, the GRASPion combines ease of use, programmability, and mechanical versatility. It features dual vibrating motors for self-propulsion, integrated sensors for local interaction, and customizable firmware enabling various motion modes, from ballistic to diffusive regimes. The robot is equipped with onboard IR communication, color and proximity sensors, and a magnetometer, allowing for real-time interaction and complex collective behaviors. With a runtime exceeding 90 minutes and reproducible fabrication, the GRASPion provides a robust and scalable platform for both educational and research applications in out-of-equilibrium physics. This article details the mechanical and electronic design and software architecture of the GRASPion, and illustrates its capabilities through prototypical experiments relevant to active matter.

Title: Ions leaving no tracks

Abstract: The paths of swift heavy ions are typically traceable in solids, because of confined electronic interactions along the paths, inducing what is known in literature as 'ion tracks', i.e. nano-sized in cross-section cylindrical zones of modified material extending for microns in length. Such tracks readily form in materials exhibiting low thermal conductivities, in particular insulators or semiconductors, altering the homogeneity of materials. In this work, using recently discovered gamma/beta-Ga2O3 polymorph heterostructures we show that, in contrast to the trends in many other materials, including that in beta-Ga2O3, swift heavy ions leave no tracks in gamma-Ga2O3. We explained this trend in terms of amazingly fast disorder recovery, occurring because of multiple configurations in the gamma-Ga2O3 lattice itself, so that the disorder formed by ion impacts gets rapidly erased, giving a perception of ions leaving no tracks. As such, gamma-Ga2O3, readily integrated with beta-Ga2O3 in polymorph heterostructures, may become a promising semiconductor platform for devices capable to operate in extremely harsh radiation environments.

Title: Review of contact models used in Discrete Element Method (DEM)
Authors: S Ganguli, P S Goswami, M Bose
Abstract: This work presents a detailed review of the methods proposed to implement Mindlin's no-slip and partial slip model under constant normal loading and Mindlin Deresiewicz's extensional work on micro-slip under varying normal loading, for the simulation of granular flow. Various methods that followed Mindlin's and Mindlin and Deresiewicz's approaches for modeling the tangential contact between two spherical particles are reviewed thoroughly, first, to understand the tangential load-displacement behaviour and finally to compare the tangential coefficient of restitution obtained from each of these models with the experimentally determined values reported in the literature. The tangential load-displacement behaviour obtained from the integral method is qualitatively different from that determined by the incremental method, which accounts for the loading history. Tangential and rotational coefficient of restitution in the gross sliding regime obtained from all the models show excellent agreement with the experimental result, but in the sticking regime, the agreement is only qualitative.

Title: Quantum Fisher Information as a Measure of Symmetry Breaking in Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Shion Yamashika, Shimpei Endo, Hiroyasu Tajima
Abstract: Symmetry breaking underlies diverse phenomena from phase transitions in condensed matter to fundamental interactions in gauge theories. Despite many proposed indicators, a general quantification of symmetry breaking that is faithful, computable, and valid in the thermodynamic limit has remained elusive. Here, within quantum resource theory, we propose the quantum Fisher information (QFI) as such a measure. We demonstrate its utility by computing QFI for paradigmatic models: in the BCS superconductor, the QFI counts the number of Cooper pairs; in the transverse-field XY spin chains, it captures topological phase transition that has no local order parameter; and in quantum quench dynamics, it allows us to exactly derive the microscopic origin and conditions of the quantum Mpemba effect in terms of excitation propagation, including in the thermodynamic limit--beyond the reach of previous analyses. Our results show that the QFI, which is a complete resource monotone in the resource theory of asymmetry that plays the role of entanglement entropy in entanglement theory, faithfully captures symmetry breaking in condensed-matter systems. These results highlight the QFI as a universal and physically meaningful diagnostic of symmetry breaking in both equilibrium and non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems.

Title: Steady state diagram of interacting fermionic atoms coupled to dissipative cavities
Authors: Luisa Tolle, Ameneh Sheikhan, Thierry Giamarchi, Corinna Kollath, Catalin-Mihai Halati
Abstract: We investigate fermionic atoms subjected to an optical lattice and coupled to a high finesse optical cavity with photon losses. A transverse pump beam introduces a coupling between the atoms and the cavity field. We explore the steady state phase diagram taking fluctuations around the mean-field of the atoms-cavity coupling into account. Our approach allows us to investigate both one- and higher-dimensional atomic systems. The fluctuations beyond mean-field lead to an effective temperature which changes the nature of the self-organization transition. We find a strong dependence of the results on the atomic filling, in particular when contrasting the behavior at low filling and at half filling. At low filling the transition to a self-organized phase takes place at a critical value of the pump strength. In the self-organized phase the cavity field takes a finite expectation value and the atoms show a modulation in the density. Surprisingly, at even larger pump strengths a strongly non-monotonous behavior of the temperature is found and hints towards effects of cavity cooling at many-body resonances. Additionally multiple self-organized stable solutions of the cavity field and the atoms occur, signaling the presence of a fluctuation-induced bistability, with the two solutions having different effective temperatures previously discussed in [Tolle et al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 133602 (2025)]. In contrast, at half filling a bistable region arises at the self-organization transition already neglecting the fluctuations. The presence of the fluctuations induce an effective temperature as at lower filling and change the behavior of the transition and the steady states drastically. We analyze the properties of the occurring steady states of the coupled atoms-cavity system.

Title: First-principles study of formic acid decomposition on single Pt atoms supported on heteroatom-doped graphene
Authors: Kazuma Sato, Norihito Sakaguchi, Yuji Kunisada
Abstract: Formic acid is a promising liquid hydrogen carrier, but its catalytic decomposition requires both high activity and selectivity toward dehydrogenation. Here, we investigated the catalytic activity and selectivity of formic acid decomposition on single Pt atoms supported on pristine and heteroatom-doped graphene using first-principles calculations based on the density functional theory. Reaction energy profiles reveal that single Pt atoms on P- and O-doped graphene show catalytic activity comparable to Pt(111), while all systems maintain strong dehydrogenation selectivity. These findings highlight doped graphene as a promising support for reducing precious metal usage in dehydrogenation catalysts.

Title: Different Phases in a Dissipative Rydberg Lattice : Roles of Occupancy and On-site Interaction
Authors: Suvechha Indu, Aniruddha Biswas, Raka Dasgupta
Abstract: We study a two-level dissipative non-equilibrium bosonic Rydberg system in an optical lattice, where multiple atoms can occupy a single site. The system is treated using two different approaches: solution of the master equation using a mean-field approximation, and direct numerical simulation of an equivalent quantum model. It is found that, depending on the on-site interaction strength, the system can either be uniform or have an antiferromagnet-like density-wave structure in terms of the Rydberg excitation distribution. Our mean-field treatment detects an interesting oscillatory phase as well, but the numerical simulation in 1D does not capture it. The origin of all these phases are investigated by studying the spatial correlations, and by calculating the fixed points of the dynamics. It is observed that an initial population difference across the sublattices helps to enhance the density-wave order. The scaling behavior of the system is also analyzed and a signature of weak universality is obtained.

Title: Emergence of continuously varying critical exponents in coupled map lattice as an effect of quenched disorder
Authors: Priyanka D. Bhoyar, Govindan Rangarajan, Prashant M. gade
Abstract: The transition to an absorbing phase in a spatiotemporal system is a well-investigated nonequilibrium dynamic transition. The absorbing phase transitions fall into a few universality classes, defined by the critical exponents observed at the critical point. We present a coupled map lattice (CML) model with quenched disorder in the couplings. In this model, spatial disorders are introduced in the form of asymmetric coupling with a larger coupling ($p$) to a neighbor on the right and a smaller coupling ($1-p$) to the neighbor on the left, for $0 \le p \le0.5$. For $p=0$, the system belongs to the directed percolation universality class. For $p>0$, we observe continuously changing critical exponents at the critical point. The order parameter is the fraction of turbulent sites $m(t)$. %sites that are not in the laminar region. We observe a power-law decay, $m(t) \sim t^{-\delta}$, at the critical point $\epsilon_c$, where $\epsilon$ is the diffusive coupling parameter. These exponents change continuously and do not match any known universality class in any limit. This could be related to changes in the eigenvalue spectrum of the connectivity matrix as the disorder is introduced.

Title: Tunneling resonances through periodically driven quantum dots
Authors: Jan Mathis Giesen, Daniel Weber, Sebastian Eggert
Abstract: Periodic driving of quantum dots is analyzed as a basis for developing dynamic switching devices. We study transport through periodically modulated energy levels which are coupled to leads via tunneling coefficients. Utilizing Floquet theory a full analytic solution is found in terms of continued fractions, enabling us to efficiently calculate and analyze the transmission through the quantum dot in relevant parameter regimes. By considering levels at higher energy outside the spectrum of the transmitted particles a resonant switching effects is identified, where a very small oscillating control signal on a weakly connected quantum dot can induce perfect transmission. We also find closed form expressions using Bessel functions in the limit of small tunnel couplings. The results predict and explain resonant tunneling in nano-electronic devices as well as in corresponding setups using magnonic systems, photonic waveguides, or ultra-cold gases in optical lattices.

Title: Atomic Layer Etching of Aluminum Nitride: Mechanistic Insights from First-Principles Studies of Chlorine Chemistry
Authors: Sanjay Nayak, Nikolai Andrianov, Thomas Gruhn, Joaquin Miranda
Abstract: Using first-principles density functional theory calculations in combination with the climbing-image nudged elastic band method, we investigated the adsorption, desorption, and diffusion of atomic chlorine and molecular chlorine on the Al terminated 0001 surface of aluminum nitride. Our results reveal that both atomic Cl and Cl2 exhibit a chemisorption character with high binding energies. Calculations revealed that the splitting pathway of Cl2 on the Al terminated AlN 0001 surface is a barrierless and exothermic process. These findings provide new microscopic-scale insights into halogen-insulator surface interactions and opportunities for new strategies in optimizing AlN atomic layer etching process in semiconductor fabrication.

Title: Sorting of binary active-passive mixtures in designed microchannels
Authors: Horacio Serna, C. Miguel Barriuso G., Ignacio Pagonabarraga, Marco Polin, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Mixtures of active and passive particles are ubiquitous at the microscale. Many essential microbial processes involve interactions with dead or immotile cells or passive crowders. When passive objects are immersed in active baths, their transport properties are enhanced and can be tuned by controlling active agents' spatial and orientational distribution. Active-passive mixtures provide a platform to explore fundamental questions about the emergent behaviour of passive objects under simultaneous thermal and active noise and a foundation for technological applications in cargo delivery and bioremediation. In this work, we use computational simulations to study an active-passive mixture confined in microchannels designed with funnel-like obstacles that selectively allow the passage of passive particles. Active particles follow overdamped Langevin translational dynamics and run-and-tumble rotational dynamics. We find that adjusting the tumbling rate of active agents and the microchannel geometry leads to a maximum enhancement of the transport properties of the passive particles (diffusion coefficient and advective velocity) that correlates with the highest mixture sorting efficiency and the shortest response time.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation bounds for time-dependently driven conductors
Authors: Ludovico Tesser, José Balduque, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We analyze the noise in a multi-terminal multi-channel conductor under arbitrary time-dependent driving and subject to -- possibly large -- static potential and temperature biases. We show that the full out-of-equilibrium zero-frequency noise is constrained by a fluctuation-dissipation bound. It consists of an upper bound expressed in terms of weighted current components of the separate Floquet bands arising from the time-dependent driving. In the limit of large static temperature bias, it has an intuitive interpretation in terms of the dissipated powers due to the static potential bias and due to the time-dependent driving. Furthermore, we show the existence of a second bound that relies on the specific shape of the electron distribution resulting from the driving, which is often even tighter than the fluctuation-dissipation bound. We show the implications of our bounds at the simple, but experimentally relevant example of a two-terminal conductor in the presence of an ac bias.

Title: Dispersed multi-walled carbon nanotubes in polyvinyl butyral matrix for transparent ionic conductive films

Abstract: In this work, we develop methods for increasing the dispersion degree of agglomerated multiwalled carbon nanotubes with subsequent introduction of them into polyvinyl butyral to create transparent conductive films. The influence of proton and a-proton solvents in combination with potassium triiodide (KI3) as a redox component for oxidation of the multiwalled carbon nanotubes surface, which reduces agglomeration due to electrostatic repulsion, is investigated. It is demonstrated that a-proton solvent cyclohexanone ensures a smaller size of the agglomerates (30-300 nm, with a maximum of ~145 nm) compared to proton solvent propyl alcohol (100-3000 nm, with a maximum of ~920 nm). The reduced aggregation is associated with the formation of oxygen-containing functional groups (C=O, C-O, C-O-C, and COO), which increase electrostatic stabilization. The impedance analysis showed that the constant component of the conductivity in the samples with multiwalled carbon nanotubes and a-proton solvent shifts to frequencies of ~104 rad/s after the addition of the redox component, which indicates the formation of ion-conducting channels and stabilization of the jump charge transfer.

Title: Unusual magnetic order in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$

Abstract: In solid-state compounds, the valence of europium can sometimes be mixed -- which is especially favored in structures with several positions for the europium atoms. In this work, we study the Eu-based intermetallic noncentrosymmetric system Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ which has 65 atoms per unit cell and 4 distinct crystallographic positions for europium and 17 positions for mercury. Our detailed analysis of magnetism of large single crystals suggests that europium in Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ might be present in two valence states, resulting in a fragile magnetic ground state. Due to the cage-like structure with a large distance between the Eu atoms, those atoms are weakly ferromagnetically coupled and Eu$_{10}$Hg$_{55}$ orders at low temperatures, below $T_{1} = 5.5$ K, with a subsequent spin re-orientation at $T_{2} = 4.3$ K. There is no sign of magnetic frustration. Interestingly, the magnetic ordering of europium sub-lattices results in a magnetization pole reversal with a weak ferrimagnetic ground state. Additional magnetic phases can be induced by application of a modest external magnetic field.

Title: Polarizability of a Wigner crystal
Authors: Navinder Singh
Abstract: We present a calculation of the imaginary part of the polarizability of a Wigner crystal using the Fluctuation-Dissipation theorem. The oscillations of the localized electrons about their equilibrium positions are treated in the harmonic approximation and the electric dipole-moment -- dipole-moment correlator is computed by a normal mode expansion. The amplitudes and phases of the different normal modes are assumed to be statistically independent. In the first case, polarizability is computed in the high temperature limit, $k_B T>>\hbar \Omega_W$ (here, $\Omega_W$ is the Wigner frequency, analogous to the Debye frequency of the phonon case). In the second case, a general expression (valid both at high and low temperature limits) is obtained using a phenomenological damping model. The connection between our general expression and that of the Lorentz oscillator model is discussed. It turns out that the Wigner crystal would be transparent for applied frequencies greater than the Wigner frequency. A standard ellipsometry set-up can test the predictions of the theory.

Title: First-principles approach to ultrafast pump-probe spectroscopy in solids
Authors: Lu Qiao, Ronaldo Rodrigues Pela, Claudia Draxl
Abstract: Pump-probe spectroscopy is a powerful tool to study ultrafast exciton dynamics, revealing the underlying complex interactions on the electronic scale. Despite significant advances in experimental techniques, developing a comprehensive and rigorous theoretical framework for modeling and interpreting the transient response in photoexcited materials remains a challenge. Here, we present a first-principles approach to simulating pump-probe spectroscopy and disentangling the electronic and thermal contributions underlying exciton dynamics. We showcase our method to three materials, representative for different classes of solids: the transition-metal dichalcogenides WSe$_2$, the halide perovskite CsPbBr$_3$, and the transition-metal oxide TiO$_2$, showing remarkable agreement with experimental counterparts. We find that (i) photoinduced Coulomb screening is the primary electronic effect, responsible for a blue shift of exciton resonances, while (ii) Pauli blocking plays a minor role, and (iii) thermal lattice expansion leads to a red shift of the spectra. We further demonstrate how key parameters such as excitation density, pump photon energy, and pump polarization modulate the transient absorption spectra, offering direct control over the exciton-resonance energy. Our approach establishes a quantitative and predictive framework for interpreting pump-probe experiments, providing actionable insights for the design of energy-selective optoelectronic devices through exciton engineering.

Title: Controlling the Glass Transition through Active Fluctuating Interactions
Authors: Emir Sezik, Henry Alston, Thibault Bertrand
Abstract: Fluctuating pairwise interactions are understood to drive fluid-like states in dense biological systems. These states find a broad range of functionalities, such as directing growth during morphogenesis and forming aggregates with heightened mechanical response. However, a tractable model capturing the role of microscopic fluctuating interactions in these structural transitions is crucially lacking. Here, we study a $p$-spin model with fluctuating pairwise couplings (of strength $D_a$ and persistence time $t_a$) as a schematic model for interaction-mediated fluidization. We find that while stronger fluctuations suppress the glass transition, more persistent fluctuations have the opposite effect. We identify the presence of an emergent fluctuation-dissipation relation at long times. We numerically extract the critical temperature $T_c(D_a, t_a)$ from a scaling relation near the transition, illustrating how microscopic fluctuations control the glass transition.

Title: Investigation on Structural, Optical, Thermal, and Magnetic Properties of Bismuth Ferrite Nanoparticles Synthesized at Lower Annealing Temperature
Authors: Naresh Prajapati, G. Surya Prakash, Manoj Kumar, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: Due to its multiferroic properties and narrow optical bandgap, Bismuth ferrite has been widely explored for spintronics, photovoltaics, and photocatalysis applications. Bismuth ferrite can be synthesized in various forms like bulk, thin films, and nanostructures using various synthesis techniques. It is challenging to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase due to the volatile nature of bismuth and the very narrow temperature range for forming this phase. So, this work aims to synthesize the pure BiFeO3 phase at lower annealing temperatures using an efficient sol-gel method. We have chosen the annealing temperature from 450 to 650 C, and a detailed analysis of structural and optical properties is performed here. X-ray diffraction is used to confirm the crystalline nature of the material. Single-phase Rietveld analysis of XRD patterns is carried out to study the effect of annealing temperature on structural parameters. All the samples are crystalized in pure rhombohedral BiFeO3 phase with the R3c space group symmetry, except those annealed at higher temperatures, 600 C and 650 C. Strain and dislocation densities were decreasing with an increase in the annealing temperature. From the UV-visible analysis, a strong response is observed below 600 nm in the visible region, and the band gap from the absorption behaviour is estimated in the range of 2.26 - 2.60 eV for these Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. Fourier transform infrared analysis confirmed the existence of metal-oxygen bonds in Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles. These nanoparticles were found to be thermally stable from the thermal analysis performed using differential scanning calorimetry. Bismuth ferrite nanoparticles were weakly magnetic from the vibrating sample magnetometry analysis.

Title: Spinning mixtures: nonreciprocity transfers chirality across scales in scalar densities
Authors: Giulia Pisegna, Suropriya Saha
Abstract: We present a minimal model for mixtures of chiral active particles, formulated solely in terms of the number densities of the species. Nonreciprocity and chirality enter the chemical potential at vanishing order in spatial gradients, taking the form of local and non-local contributions. Chirality manifests as the curl of the nonreciprocal current, while the latter is simultaneously strongly modified by former. Their interplay generates distinctive dynamical states, including phase separation with edge currents and a spatiotemporally disordered phase with both chiral and nonreciprocal signatures.

Title: Electronic structure and thermoelectric properties of CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy: Doping overtones
Authors: A. Shukla, Sadhana Matth, Raghavendra Pal, S.S.A. Warsi, Himanshu Pandey
Abstract: The quest for thermoelectric materials with high figures of merit is an ongoing and significant area of research. In this study, we investigate the thermoelectric properties of the CoTiSi half-Heusler alloy using density functional theory calculations implemented via the Wien2k package. Our approach begins with a thorough structural optimization to determine the equilibrium lattice parameter and the atomic positions of the constituent elements within the unit cell of CoTiSi. Following this, we analyze the thermal transport properties of the alloy under the constant relaxation time approximation, which allows us to gain insights into its thermoelectric performance. Our calculations reveal a substantial Seebeck voltage and thermopower, with notably higher values for P-type doping than N-type doping. This finding highlights the enhanced thermoelectric performance of P-type carriers in this material, providing a starting point for experimentalists to utilize this alloy for real device applications.

Title: Structural analysis of co-sputtered Cu-Nb and Cu-Pd textured thin films
Authors: Claudia Cancellieri, Giacomo Lorenzin, Yeliz Unutulmazsoy, Andriy Lotnyk, Daniel Ariosa
Abstract: Structural characterization of nanoscale-two-metal-phase systems, which exhibit partial, complete, or no mixing when co-sputtered with a few percent of a minority element, is extremely challenging. Co-sputtering two metals at room temperature results in frozen disorder within the deposited films. Distinguishing the contribution of each metal phase, determining the distribution and self-organization of the second constituent element within the lattice, accurately quantifying the extra element content, and assessing internal disorder through diffraction analysis are complex and require the development of a suitable model to fit diffraction patterns from various geometries. Here, we present a model to describe the structural distribution of alloy elements in magnetron-sputtered Cu thin films, exploring two contrasting cases: 1) with the mutually immiscible Nb and 2) with Pd, which has a negative heat of mixing with Cu, forming stable alloys. A comparison between X-ray diffraction data and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy-derived elemental distribution is discussed.

Title: Selective band engineering of Bi/Si(111) by boron segregation
Authors: E. Barre, J. Villalobos-Castro, T. Pierron, S. Pons, D. Roditchev, L. Sponza, S. Vlaic
Abstract: Atomically thin layers of metals deposited on semiconductors display a variety of physical properties such as superconductivity, charge density waves, topological phases, strong spin-orbit (Rashba) splitting, among others. To access these exotic phases and induce new ones, it is necessary to control and tune the energies of the electronic states of those heterostructures. In this work we investigate the engineering of the band structure of the two-dimensional Bi/Si(111) $\beta$-phase using a modulation doping approach based on boron segregation at the surface. We demonstrate that the Bi-induced Rashba bands can be displaced in energy by up to 200 meV without altering their strong Rashba parameter. Importantly, while the Bi states shift upward, the underlying Si valence states remain essentially fixed, which rules out a simple band-bending scenario. Our density functional theory calculations reveal that the displacement originates from changes in the hybridization of Si states near the surface, induced by the presence of B atoms. This selective mechanism halves the distance of the Rashba-split states from the Fermi level, opening the way to their exploitation in transport and spintronic devices and highlighting the broader potential of modulation doping as a band-engineering strategy for two-dimensional metals on semiconductors.

Title: Chirality-Induced Orbital Selectivity through Linear-Orbital Coupling
Authors: Namgee Cho, James Lim, Martin B. Plenio
Abstract: This work investigates electron transport through chiral electrostatic potentials by modeling the system in three spatial dimensions and demonstrates that chirality-induced orbital selectivity (CIOS) produces pronounced enantiospecific transmission, dependent on the electron's initial orbital angular momentum (OAM) state. The results show that transverse electron motion in a chiral environment, captured by OAM dynamics, gives rise to strong orbital selectivity that reverses upon inversion of the handedness of the chiral potential. This behavior originates from a coupling between the electron's linear and orbital angular momenta, leading to effects that are significantly stronger than those arising from spin-phonon and bare spin-orbit interactions under realistic physical conditions. Moreover, the CIOS effect is shown to increase with the length of the chiral region and remains robust against static disorder. The orbital selectivity can give rise to spin selectivity when initial correlations exist between spin and OAM states. These findings underscore the importance of orbital contributions to enantiospecific electron transport in chiral systems and suggest that CIOS plays a critical role alongside existing spin-based mechanisms.

Title: Magnetostriction as the origin of the magnetodielectric effect in La2CoMnO6

Abstract: The La2CoMnO6 (LCMO) perovskite has received a lot of attention due to its near room temperature magnetodielectric effect. Despite the recent efforts, the mechanism ruling the correlation between its magnetic and dielectric properties is not yet fully understood. In order to address this issue, we conducted a detailed investigation of the coupling between the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of a polycrystalline LCMO sample. Using magnetic field-dependent x-ray powder diffraction and measurements with a capacitive dilatometer, we show that applying an external magnetic field decreases the unit cell volume, thereby modifying the octahedral distortions. Experiments involving temperature and field-dependent x-ray absorption spectroscopy at the Co-L2,3 edges provide further evidence that the spin-orbit interaction of outermost Co 3d-orbital and the field-induced enhancement of covalence effects are the key contributors to the magnetostrictive effects. From a detailed analysis using multiplet and density functional theory calculations, we propose that the field-induced modulations of the orbital hybridization and the ligand-to-metal charge transfer are responsible for the changes in the dielectric response of LCMO, thus enabling a direct coupling between magnetic, elastic and dielectric properties in this material.

Title: Slit-snapping and multistability in buckled beams with partial cuts
Authors: Bernat Durà Faulí, Lennard Kwakernaak, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Elastic instabilities such as buckling and snapping have evolved into a powerful design principle, enabling memory, sequential shape morphing, and computing in metamaterials and devices. Modifying the post-buckling configurations or their snapping transitions would greatly expand design possibilities, yet general principles for controlling elastic instabilities are lacking. Here, we show that adding a partial cut, or slit, to a flexible beam enables precise control of post-buckling behavior: under compression, slit-beams first buckle, then snap, leading to trista-bility within the hysteretic regime. A truss model explains these phenomena by uncovering the interplay of geometric and slit induced nonlinearities. Leveraging these insights, we realize multi-slit beams with programmable behavior, unlocking a vast design space featuring giant hysteresis, quadstability, multi-step snapping, tristability at zero compression, and compression-induced snapping between left and right-buckled states. Our strategy is general, simple to design and implement, and enables mechanical metamaterials and devices with advanced memory and sequential behavior.

Title: Mode-coupling theory of the glass transition for a liquid in a periodic potential
Authors: Abolfazl Ahmadirahmat, Michele Caraglio, Vincent Krakoviack, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We derive a microscopic theory for the structural dynamics in the vicinity of the glass transition for a liquid exposed to a one-dimensional periodic potential. The periodic potential breaks translational invariance, in particular, the density exhibits a periodic modulation. Using techniques familiar from solid-state theory, we define generalized intermediate scattering functions from fluctuating densities in wave-vector space. Exact equations of motion are derived within the Mori-Zwanzig projection-operator formalism reflecting the residual lattice symmetries. Due to the lack of rotational symmetry it is necessary to split the currents into components parallel and perpendicular to the modulation. We provide a closure of the equations in terms of a mode-coupling approximation for the force kernel. The theory reflects the usual analytic properties of correlation functions and encodes all phenomena known for mode-coupling theories. We prove that the theory reduces to the conventional mode-coupling theory in the case of vanishing amplitude of the modulation.

Title: Building causation links in stochastic nonlinear systems from data
Authors: Sergio Chibbaro, Cyril Furtlehner, Théo Marchetta, Andrei-Tiberiu Pantea, Davide Rossetti
Abstract: Causal relationships play a fundamental role in understanding the world around us. The ability to identify and understand cause-effect relationships is critical to making informed decisions, predicting outcomes, and developing effective strategies. However, deciphering causal relationships from observational data is a difficult task, as correlations alone may not provide definitive evidence of causality. In recent years, the field of machine learning (ML) has emerged as a powerful tool, offering new opportunities for uncovering hidden causal mechanisms and better understanding complex systems. In this work, we address the issue of detecting the intrinsic causal links of a large class of complex systems in the framework of the response theory in physics. We develop some theoretical ideas put forward by [1], and technically we use state-of-the-art ML techniques to build up models from data. We consider both linear stochastic and non-linear systems. Finally, we compute the asymptotic efficiency of the linear response based causal predictor in a case of large scale Markov process network of linear interactions.

Title: Efficient Generation of Second-Harmonic Propagating Spin Waves in a Thin, Out-of-Plane-Magnetized Ferromagnetic Film
Authors: Mathieu Moalic, Youenn Patat, Mateusz Zelent, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: Spin waves are attractive information carriers owing to their gigahertz-to-terahertz frequencies, nanometric wavelengths, and negligible Joule heating. Yet the efficient excitation of short-wavelength, high-frequency spin waves and the exploitation of nonlinear effects remain challenging. We propose a hybrid ferromagnetic nanostructure composed of a small, in-plane-magnetized rim (a magnonic nanocavity) exchange-coupled to an out-of-plane-magnetized region. Micromagnetic simulations show that a spatially uniform out-of-plane microwave field excites the rim's fundamental mode; its second harmonic is then coherently and efficiently launched into the second region of the structure, yielding propagating spin waves. The process can be realized in strip or disk geometries, providing excitation of plane-wave or radial spin waves, respectively. The conversion efficiency grows nonlinearly with the pump amplitude and can be further improved when the frequency of a higher-order standing wave in the nanocavity matches the second-harmonic frequency. The emission frequency is tunable via the bias magnetic field or the width of the nanocavity, suggesting a compact route toward on-chip, short-wavelength, high-frequency spin-wave sources for artificial neural networks.

Title: Phonon-Limited Mobility in H/F-functionalized Nanotubes with 1D $π$-chains
Authors: V.L. Katkov, V.A. Osipov
Abstract: Electron mobility due to electron-phonon interaction is investigated for fully fluorinated/hydrogenated zig-zag carbon nanotubes containing one-dimensional alternating chains of carbon atoms with $\pi$-bonds. The behavior of mobility associated with changes in the tube diameter, coating type (F/H) and temperature is revealed. In particular, it is shown that the dependence of mobility on the diameter in such tubes is periodic with the chirality index, which is associated with the absence of scattering on TA phonons in the tubes with an even number of conducting chains due to mirror symmetry. The obtained small values of phonon-limited mobility indicate that tubes with one-dimensional conducting chains are more promising for use as gas sensors than as elements of electronic devices. Calculations are performed within the self-energy relaxation time approximation (SERTA) using the non-orthogonal tight-binding approach.

Title: Exact bound of power-efficiency trade-off in finite-time thermodynamic cycles
Authors: R. X. Zhai, Xin Yue, C. P. Sun
Abstract: Power and efficiency are fundamental criteria for evaluating the performance of thermodynamic cycles. However, it is generally impossible to maximize both simultaneously. In particular, achieving maximum efficiency inevitably leads to vanishing power as the cycle duration approaches infinity. A quantitative characterization of this trade-off yields significant theoretical and practical implications. In this letter, we analytically derive an exact bound constraining power and efficiency in low-dissipation finite-time heat engines. This bound specifies the maximum power attainable at any prescribed efficiency, thereby providing a benchmarking for evaluating the performance of heat engines.

Title: Glass transition in colloidal monolayers controlled by light-induced caging
Authors: Abolfazl Ahmadirahmat, Michele Caraglio, Vincent Krakoviack, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the glass-transition problem for a quasi-two-dimensional colloidal dense suspension modulated by a one-dimensional periodic external potential as imposed by interfering laser beams. Relying on a mode-coupling approach, we examine the nonequilibrium state diagram for hard disks as a function of the density and the period of the modulation for various potential strengths. The competition between the local packing and the distortion of the cages induced by the potential leads to a striking nonmonotonic behavior of the glass-transition line which allows melting of a glass state merely by changing the external fields. In particular, we find regions in the non-equilibrium state diagram where a moderate periodic modulation stabilizes the liquid state.

Title: Quantum Transport Reservoir Computing
Authors: Yecheng Jing, Pengfei Wang, Shuai Zhang, Zhoujie Zeng, Shi-Jun Liang, Wei Chen
Abstract: Reservoir computing (RC), a neural network designed for temporal data, enables efficient computation with low-cost training and direct physical implementation. Recently, quantum RC has opened new possibilities for conventional RC and introduced novel ideas to tackle open problems in quantum physics and advance quantum technologies. Despite its promise, it faces challenges, including physical realization, output readout, and measurement-induced back-action. Here, we propose to implement quantum RC through quantum transport in mesoscopic electronic systems. Our approach possesses several advantages: compatibility with existing device fabrication techniques, ease of output measurement, and robustness against measurement back-action. Leveraging universal conductance fluctuations, we numerically demonstrate two benchmark tasks, spoken-digit recognition and time-series forecasting, to validate our proposal. This work establishes a novel pathway for implementing on-chip quantum RC via quantum transport and expands the mesoscopic physics applications.

Title: Valley Order in Moiré Topological Insulators
Authors: Bo Zou, Anzhuoer Li, Allan H. MacDonald
Abstract: Moiré materials with opposite non-zero miniband Chern numbers in time-reversal-partner valleys are two-dimensional topological insulators at band filling $\nu=2$. We explore the possibility that in this class of moir'e materials intervalley coherence can sometimes be present in interaction induced insulators at band filling $\nu=1$ , using Landau levels with opposite signs of the magnetic field as a convenient generic model. In the absence of intravalley interactions the mean-field ground state at filling factor $\nu=1$ is a gapless intervalley coherent state that maps under a particle-hole transformation of one valley to a strong-field superconducting vortex-lattice state that has been studied previously. When the ratio $\lambda$ of intravalley to intervalley interactions is increased, gapped states appear, one with broken time-reversal symmetry and a quantized Hall effect but no valley polarization and one with broken parity symmetry and zero Hall conductivity. We discuss the possibility that the latter state could be related to the fractional quantum spin Hall effect recently observed at an odd filling factor in a moir'e topological insulator and comment on related systems in which correlations between electrons in bands with opposite Chern numbers might play a key role.

Title: Algorithmic differentiation for plane-wave DFT: materials design, error control and learning model parameters
Authors: Niklas Frederik Schmitz, Bruno Ploumhans, Michael F. Herbst
Abstract: We present a differentiation framework for plane-wave density-functional theory (DFT) that combines the strengths of algorithmic differentiation (AD) and density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). In the resulting AD-DFPT framework derivatives of any DFT output quantity with respect to any input parameter (e.g. geometry, density functional or pseudopotential) can be computed accurately without deriving gradient expressions by hand. We implement AD-DFPT into the Density-Functional ToolKit (DFTK) and show its broad applicability. Amongst others we consider the inverse design of a semiconductor band gap, the learning of exchange-correlation functional parameters, or the propagation of DFT parameter uncertainties to relaxed structures. These examples demonstrate a number of promising research avenues opened by gradient-driven workflows in first-principles materials modeling.

Title: Dislocation Transmission Across Tilt Low-Angle Grain Boundaries in BCC Fe: The Role of Elastic Interactions
Authors: Shuai Zhang, Zhishun Chen, Zhuoming Xie, Jun Song, Huiqiu Deng, Wangyu Hu, Jie Hou
Abstract: Low-angle grain boundaries (LAGBs) are often regarded as penetrable interfaces to dislocation motion, yet recent studies suggest they can also act as strong barriers. The origin of this duality remains debated, particularly regarding the role of elastic interactions. Here, large-scale molecular dynamics simulations are employed to investigate dislocation transmission across various tilt LAGBs in BCC Fe. The results show that transmission resistance varies widely with boundary-dislocation geometry. Contrary to the prevailing view that dislocation reactions dominate, elastic interactions between lattice and boundary dislocations emerge as the primary controlling factor. Screw and screw-like dislocations generate shear stresses that bend GB dislocations and produce strong barriers, whereas edge dislocations lack such stresses and transmit more readily. Consequently, barrier strength increases as the dislocation character angle decreases, with screw dislocations experiencing the strongest resistance. An analytical model is developed that quantitatively predicts the net transmission stress, in excellent agreement with simulations. These findings establish a mechanistic framework for LAGB-dislocation interactions and offer guidance for designing LAGB-strengthened materials.

Title: Spin susceptibility in a pseudogap state with fluctuating spiral magnetic order
Authors: Paulo Forni, Pietro M. Bonetti, Henrik Müller-Groeling, Demetrio Vilardi, Walter Metzner
Abstract: We compute the electron spin susceptibility in the pseudogap regime of the two-dimensional Hubbard model in the framework of a SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetic order. The electrons are fractionalized in fermionic chargons with a pseudospin degree of freedom and bosonic spinons. The chargons are treated in a renormalized mean-field theory and order in a Néel or spiral magnetic state in a broad range around half-filling below a transition temperature $T^*$. Fluctuations of the spin orientation are captured by the spinons. Their dynamics is governed by a non-linear sigma model, with spin stiffnesses computed microscopically from the pseudospin susceptibility of the chargons. The SU(2) gauge group is higgsed in the chargon sector, and the spinon fluctuations prevent breaking of the physical spin symmetry at any finite temperature. The electron spin susceptibility obtained from the gauge theory shares many features with experimental observations in the pseudogap regime of cuprate superconductors: the dynamical spin susceptibility $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ has a spin gap, the static uniform spin susceptibility $\kappa_s$ decreases strongly with temperature below $T^*$, and the NMR relaxation rate $T_1^{-1}$ vanishes exponentially in the low temperature limit if the ground state is quantum disordered. At low hole doping, $S(\mathbf{q},\omega)$ exhibits nematicity below a transition temperature $T_{\rm nem} < T^*$, and at larger hole doping in the entire pseudogap regime below $T^*$.

Title: Physical origin of current-induced switching angle shift in magnetic heterostructures
Authors: Xiaomiao Yin, Guanglei Han, Guowen Gong, Jun Kang, Changmin Xiong, Lijun Zhu
Abstract: Accurate quantification of the spin-orbit torques (SOTs) is critical for the identification and applications of new spin-orbitronic effects. One of the most popular techniques to qualify the SOTs is the switching angle shift, where the applied direct current was assumed to shift, via domain wall depinning during the anti-domain expansion, the switching angle of a perpendicular magnetization in a linear proportion manner under a large rotating magnetic field. Here, we report that, for the most commonly employed perpendicular magnetization heterostructures in spintronics (e.g., those based on FeCoB, Co, and Co/Ni multilayers), the switching angle shift considerably misestimates the SOT within the domain wall depinning analysis of the slope of the linear-in-current scaling and may also have a non-zero residual value at zero direct current. Our experiments and simulations unveil that the switching angle shift is most likely dominated by the chiral asymmetric nucleation rather than the expansion of the anti-domains. The in-plane field from external magnet and current-induced SOTs lower the perpendicular nucleation field and thus the required switching angle, ultimately leading to underestimation of the SOTs by the domain wall depinning analysis. These results have advanced the understanding of magnetization switching of spintronic devices.

Title: Decoratypes: An Extensible Crystal Taxonomy for Machine Learning-Guided Materials Discovery
Authors: Kyle D. Miller, Michele Campbell, Danilo Puggioni, James M. Rondinelli
Abstract: We introduce decoratypes as a structure taxonomy that classifies compounds based on site decorations of specific structural prototypes. Building on this foundation, a ferroelectric materials discovery framework is developed, integrating decoratypes with an active learning approach to accelerate exploration. In addition, six novel ferroelectric candidates are predicted, including three strain-activated ferroelectrics and three strain-activated hyperferroelectrics. These findings highlight the potential of the decoratype taxonomy to enhance our understanding of structure-driven material properties and facilitate the discovery of promising yet underexplored regions of chemical space.

Title: Temperature and magnetic field dependent $g$-factors in electron spin resonance spectroscopy
Authors: Sebastian Kalhöfer
Abstract: We propose that phonons coupled to electrons play an important role in both the fundamental phenomenology of electron spin resonance as well as the interpretation of such measurements. By including spin-dependent electron-phonon interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling, we demonstrate that the g-factor acquires emergent temperature dependencies that are in excellent agreement with experimental observations. Moreover, we predict that at low temperatures, the $g$-factor will exhibit a non-trivial dependence on the magnetic field, indicating a dynamic property that has not been previously considered in electron-phonon systems. We further predict the influence of phonons to be negligible at very low and very high temperatures, with the former requiring experimental verification.

Title: Cavity-induced Eliashberg effect: superconductivity vs charge density wave
Authors: Md Mursalin Islam, Michele Pini, R. Flores-Calderón, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: Recent experiments have shown that non-equilibrium effects can play a key role in cavity-based control of material phases, notably in systems with charge-density-wave order. Motivated by this, we extend the theory of the Eliashberg effect, originally developed for superconducting phases, to charge-density-wave phases. Starting from a minimal electronic model where superconductivity and charge-density-wave order are equivalent at equilibrium, we introduce coupling to cavity photons, which are in turn coupled to an environment at a temperature different from the one of the electronic environment. This drives the system into a non-thermal steady state, which breaks the equivalence between superconductivity and charge-density-wave order. In the superconducting case, we recover the known behavior: a shift from continuous to discontinuous phase transitions with bistability. In contrast, the charge-density-wave case displays richer behavior: tuning the cavity frequency induces both continuous and discontinuous transitions, two distinct ordered phases, and a bistable regime ending at a critical point. These findings demonstrate that the scope of cavity-based non-thermal control of quantum materials is broader than at thermal equilibrium, and strongly depends on the targeted phases.

Abstract: Lithium niobate-on-insulator (LNOI) is an emerging photonic platform with high potential for scalable quantum information processing due to its strong second-order nonlinearity. However, little progress has been made in developing on-chip single-photon detectors on LNOI. Niobium titanium nitride (NbTiN) superconducting nanowire single-photon detectors (SNSPDs) are a promising candidate for this application. In this work, we use DC reactive magnetron sputtering to grow high-quality NbTiN thin films using an ultra-high vacuum deposition system with a base pressure lower than $2\times 10^{-10}$ mbar. Enabled by the low concentration of background impurities in this system, we investigate the impact of substrate temperature during NbTiN growth. We achieve four nm thick superconducting films with a critical temperature ($T_{c}$) of 12.3 K grown at a substrate temperature of 825 K. We find that the NbTiN films grow in the (111) orientation and evolve from a porous pillar structure when grown at low temperatures to densely packed fibrous grains at higher temperatures. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the increased substrate temperature reduces the oxygen concentration in our films and improves the overall stoichiometry. In addition, we integrate these films with the LNOI platform and investigate the obtained interface quality. Lastly, we fabricate SNSPDs from the NbTiN film on LNOI and characterize the detector performance.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry for fractional excitations: Unified framework and dip width scaling
Authors: Aleksander Latyshev, Imen Taktak, Ipsita Mandal, Ines Safi
Abstract: Extending Hong--Ou--Mandel (HOM) interferometry to the fractional quantum Hall effect (FQHE) promises direct access to anyonic statistics, yet remains challenging: on-demand anyon injection is hindered by integer-charged minimal excitations, and recent HOM experiments in the FQHE lack a fully consistent theoretical framework. Here we provide a general theory of time-resolved HOM interferometry in quantum Hall systems. Combining the nonequilibrium bosonized edge theory (NEBET) with the unifying non-equilibrium perturbative theory (UNEPT), we derive exact and perturbative relations obeyed by the relevant cross-correlations of chiral currents valid for spatially extended tunneling operators and generic quadratic edge dynamics. Then, within the Tomonaga--Luttinger liquid (TLL) framework, we analyze the width of the HOM dip for injected pulses carrying integer and fractional charges. We show that it is governed by the width of the pulses and, for the fractional charge, by a non-trivial power-law behavior of the scaling dimension. Our results establish a robust theoretical foundation for interpreting recent experiments on anyonic statistics and electronic interferometry in the quantum Hall regime.

Abstract: Guided by a comprehensive analysis of accumulation mode transistor physics and oxide semiconductor materials properties, we demonstrate an innovative oxide semiconductor transistor structure and process flow that break the constraint between performance and reliability observed in conventional InGaZnO4 (IGZO) transistors. The newly proposed 10 nm innovative IGZO transistor features high on-current, high extrinsic mobility (20 cm2V-1s-1), near-zero hysteresis, and only 15 mV Vt shift after positive-bias-stress (PBS) of 3 MV/cm stress for 1000s at room temperature.

Title: Phase engineering of 1T$'$ and 1T CrS2 and Cr2S3 by MOCVD

Abstract: Layered Cr-chalcogenides compounds offer a rich range of phases with different magnetic properties some of which have been predicted only. Here we demonstrate a not yet reported crystal phase of CrS2 which is the distorted octahedral one (1T$'$) synthesized via metal-organic chemical vapour deposition (MOCVD). We achieved the tuneable synthesis of either 1T$'$ CrS2, or 1T CrS2. The phases were identified using polarized Raman spectroscopy, density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and 4D-scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM)-scanning electron diffraction. The phases of CrS2 were uniquely identified also in contrast with Cr2S3 which was synthesized and characterized by a Neel temperature of ~46 K. Using magneto-optic Kerr imaging, the 1T$'$ CrS2 crystals have soft ferromagnetic nature at low temperature, shedding light on the magnetic properties of this just predicated material. The 4DSTEM characterization reveals that the synthesis of the thermodynamically stable 1T$'$ phase occurs via a complex transformation process from the 1T to 1T$'$ resulting in a spatially correlated domain structure of differently oriented 1T$'$ crystals. Our MOCVD growth of complex and distorted phases of 2D CrS2 with long-range magnetic order paves the way for the scalable synthesis of 2D magnets for ultrathin magnetic memories for logic-in-memory applications and spintronics.

Title: UTe$_2$: a narrow band superconductor

Abstract: We investigate the nature of the 5$f$ electrons in the unconventional odd-parity superconductor UTe$_2$, focusing on the degree of covalency, localization versus itinerancy, and dominant electronic configuration. This is achieved using density functional theory (DFT) in combination with dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations. A key aspect of our approach is the material-specific tuning of the double-counting correction parameter, $\mu_{\rm dc}$, within the DFT+DMFT part. This tuning is guided by the energy dependence of photo-ionization cross-sections in valence band photoelectron spectroscopy. The reliability of the parameters is confirmed by the accurate reproduction of the angle-resolved valence-band photoemission spectra and the U 4$f$ core-level data. The DFT+DMFT model reveals that in UTe$_2$ U 5$f^n$ configurations with n=1 to 4 contribute to the ground state, with the 5$f^2$ configuration being most prevalent and an average 5$f$ shell fillings close to 2.5. The model further suggests that the 5$f$ electrons form narrow bands and that charge fluctuations due to degeneracy play a role in addition to coherent valence dynamics arising from hybridization with the conduction bath. Additionally, the significance of the U 6$d$ states in UTe$_2$ is discussed.

Title: Subbaths Cluster Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (SB-CDMFT)
Authors: A. de Lagrave, D. Sénéchal, M. Charlebois
Abstract: Cluster Dynamical Mean Field Theory (CDMFT) with an exact diagonalization (ED) impurity solver faces exponential scaling limitations from the Hilbert space dimension. We introduce subbath CDMFT (SB-CDMFT), an alternative to the conventional CDMFT-ED method in which the discrete bath is subdivided into separate subbaths, each coupled to the cluster with distinct hybridization functions. In this approach, only one subbath at a time is actively involved in ED, dramatically reducing the computational cost by replacing a single large impurity problem with multiple smaller separate ones. Our method successfully reproduces key physical properties including particle-hole symmetry and Mott physics, while allowing for an extended bath representation at a fraction of the typical computational cost.

Title: Two-legged approximation for building non-empirical hybrids and analyzing correlation at finite temperature
Authors: Brittany P. Harding, Francisca Sagredo, Vincent Martinetto, Aurora Pribram-Jones
Abstract: Warm dense matter is a highly energetic phase characterized by strong correlations, thermal effects, and quantum effects of electrons. Thermal density functional theory is commonly used in simulations of this challenging phase, driving the development of temperature-dependent approximations to the exchange-correlation free energy. In this work, a finite-temperature extension of the two-legged adiabatic connection construction is demonstrated for the uniform electron gas and asymmetric Hubbard dimer at warm dense matter conditions. This provides the structure of a temperature- and density-dependent weighting scheme for a hybrid exchange-correlation approximation. The construction also provides evidence that nonlinear thermal effects on the balance between exchange and correlation, as well as that between kinetic, entropic, and potential components of the correlation, persist and can even be emphasized by strong electron-electron interaction. These findings point additionally to a complicated interplay between temperature, density, and interaction strength in the strong correlation character of these model systems.

Title: Linking thermodynamic correlation signatures and superconductivity in twisted trilayer graphene
Authors: Jesse C. Hoke, Yifan Li, Yuwen Hu, Julian May-Mann, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Trithep Devakul, Aaron Sharpe, Benjamin E. Feldman
Abstract: Twisted graphene multilayers exhibit strong electronic correlations, which manifest in a range of experimental signatures. Yet how these signatures relate to each other and the microscopic ground states-and how twist angle and band structure reshape them-remains poorly understood. Here we study this interplay by correlating local thermodynamic and transport measurements in a twisted trilayer graphene (TTG) sample with unequal angles and flat electronic bands. We use a scanning single-electron transistor to map the impact of electron-electron interactions in a region of the sample where the local twist angle evolves smoothly. We observe gapped correlated insulators and a sawtooth in electronic compressibility, both exhibiting pronounced electron-hole (e-h) asymmetry with distinct magic angles for conduction and valence bands. Subsequent transport measurements in the same region reveal robust superconductivity with a similar e-h asymmetry. Our measurements indicate that superconductivity is not directly tied to the correlated insulators. Instead, its critical temperature correlates closely with the strength of the sawtooth in compressibility, suggesting a common origin or link between the two. By combining a local probe with transport measurements, we uncover connections between superconductivity and thermodynamic correlation signatures that are not apparent from either technique in isolation, highlighting the power of our dual approach and establishing their dependence on interlayer twist angles in TTG.

Title: Energy and information: a chronicle of hesitations on the role of the observer in physics
Authors: Didier Lairez
Abstract: Energy has no definition, except that given by a conservation principle which essentially amounts to defining it as the elements of an open list of unknown cardinality. Entropy, identified by Shannon as information we lack, has too many definitions. This results in an unstable and hesitant interpretation of their link. Thermodynamics, the science of changes in form of energy, is phenomenological, all its laws are induced from observation. From the origin, the concept of energy is linked to the observer's knowledge, to the information he has: what and where to look and with what instruments. Thermodynamics only addresses the sensible world. It is Aristotelian. But this is disturbing if we consider that reason can give us access to Plato's intelligible world, the one that is beyond the sensible world and independent of us. This is disturbing if we consider that science can access to the intrinsic properties of things, those which are independent of us. This is disturbing if we have a purely Platonic conception of science. Hence the statistical mechanics approach ("The rational foundation of thermodynamics", J.W. Gibbs). This is the first pendulum movement of ideas, whose oscillations continue to this day, because unfortunately statistical mechanics introduces many inconsistencies, mainly due to the ergodic hypothesis. Luckily, these inconsistencies are all solved by Shannon's information theory. Sadly, information theory is too Aristotelian and too conceptual. Fortunately, Landauer principle makes it more \textquote{physical}. This is currently the latest attempt to bringing the notions of energy and information back to what is considered the right side of science, that of Plato. Landauer principle is now commonly regarded as a fundamental law of physics. Unpleasantly, it can be shown that this principle is not one.

Title: Tracking photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with simulated time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy
Authors: Lina Fransén, Benjamin Roux, Sonia Coriani, Saikat Nandi, Morgane Vacher
Abstract: Spiropyran is a prototype photoswitch that undergoes photoinduced ring-opening via C-O bond fission. The quantum yield for this photochemical reaction is low, with photophysical relaxation being the dominant process. Previous theoretical studies have suggested that photophysical relaxation proceeds via cleavage and subsequent reformation of a C-N bond. However, experimental evidence for this mechanism is lacking; most time-resolved studies have probed in the ultraviolet-visible domain, where C-N bond fission is unlikely to leave clear signatures. Here, we use non-adiabatic dynamics simulations in conjunction with X-ray absorption spectroscopic calculations to investigate the possibility of tracking the photophysical relaxation in spiropyran with time-resolved X-ray absorption spectroscopy at the nitrogen K-edge. The simulations predict that cleavage of the C-N bond results in a transient red-shift of the X-ray absorption. These results indicate a potential experimental route to gain a mechanistic understanding of the efficient photophysical relaxation that limits the efficiency of spiropyran-based photochromic systems.

Title: SAM$^{*}$: Task-Adaptive SAM with Physics-Guided Rewards
Authors: Kamyar Barakati, Utkarsh Pratiush, Sheryl L. Sanchez, Aditya Raghavan, Delia J. Milliron, Mahshid Ahmadi, Philip D. Rack, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Image segmentation is a critical task in microscopy, essential for accurately analyzing and interpreting complex visual data. This task can be performed using custom models trained on domain-specific datasets, transfer learning from pre-trained models, or foundational models that offer broad applicability. However, foundational models often present a considerable number of non-transparent tuning parameters that require extensive manual optimization, limiting their usability for real-time streaming data analysis. Here, we introduce a reward function-based optimization to fine-tune foundational models and illustrate this approach for SAM (Segment Anything Model) framework by Meta. The reward functions can be constructed to represent the physics of the imaged system, including particle size distributions, geometries, and other criteria. By integrating a reward-driven optimization framework, we enhance SAM's adaptability and performance, leading to an optimized variant, SAM$^{*}$, that better aligns with the requirements of diverse segmentation tasks and particularly allows for real-time streaming data segmentation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach in microscopy imaging, where precise segmentation is crucial for analyzing cellular structures, material interfaces, and nanoscale features.

Title: Fourier Neural Operators for Time-Periodic Quantum Systems: Learning Floquet Hamiltonians, Observable Dynamics, and Operator Growth
Authors: Zihao Qi, Yang Peng, Christopher Earls
Abstract: Time-periodic quantum systems exhibit a rich variety of far-from-equilibrium phenomena and serve as ideal platforms for quantum engineering and control. However, simulating their dynamics with conventional numerical methods remains challenging due to the exponential growth of Hilbert space dimension and rapid spreading of entanglement. In this work, we introduce Fourier Neural Operators (FNO) as an efficient, accurate, and scalable surrogate for non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. Parameterized in Fourier space, FNO naturally captures temporal correlations and remains minimally dependent on discretization of time. We demonstrate the versatility of FNO through three complementary learning paradigms: reconstructing effective Floquet Hamiltonians, predicting expectation values of local observables, and learning quantum information spreading. For each learning task, FNO achieves remarkable accuracy, while attaining a significant speedup, compared to exact numerical methods. Moreover, FNO possesses a remarkable capacity to transfer learning across different temporal discretizations and system driving frequencies. We also show that FNO can extrapolate beyond the time window provided by training data, enabling access to observables and operator-spreading dynamics that might otherwise be difficult to obtain. By employing an appropriate local basis, we argue that the computational cost of FNOs scales only polynomially with the system size. Our results establish FNO as a versatile and scalable surrogate for predicting non-equilibrium quantum dynamics, with potential applications to processing data from near-term quantum computers.

Title: Clifford quantum cellular automata from topological quantum field theories and invertible subalgebras
Authors: Meng Sun, Bowen Yang, Zongyuan Wang, Nathanan Tantivasadakarn, Yu-An Chen
Abstract: We present a general framework for constructing quantum cellular automata (QCA) from topological quantum field theories (TQFT) and invertible subalgebras (ISA) using the cup-product formalism. This approach explicitly realizes all $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ Clifford QCAs (for prime $p$) in all admissible dimensions, in precise agreement with the classification predicted by algebraic $L$-theory. We determine the orders of these QCAs by explicitly showing that finite powers reduce to the identity up to finite-depth quantum circuits (FDQC) and lattice translations. In particular, we demonstrate that the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Clifford QCAs in $(4l+1)$ spatial dimensions can be disentangled by non-Clifford FDQCs. Our construction applies beyond cubic lattices, allowing $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs to be defined on arbitrary cellulations. Furthermore, we explicitly construct invertible subalgebras in higher dimensions, obtaining $\mathbb{Z}_2$ ISAs in $2l$ spatial dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ ISAs in $(4l-2)$ spatial dimensions. These ISAs give rise to $\mathbb{Z}_2$ QCAs in $(2l+1)$ dimensions and $\mathbb{Z}_p$ QCAs in $(4l-1)$ dimensions. Together, these results establish a unified and dimension-periodic framework for Clifford QCAs, connecting their explicit lattice realizations to field theories.

Title: Conformal 3-point correlators in momentum space, method of subgraphs and the $1/N$ expansion
Authors: Zhijin Li
Abstract: Conformal 3-point correlators of conserved currents play important roles in numerous directions. These correlators are fixed by conformal symmetry up to few parameters, which are known only at the leading order in the perturbative expansions. The major challenges are from the multi-loop Feynman integrals with three external momenta. In this work, we employ the method of subgraphs to compute the subleading order corrections to the conformal current 3-point correlators in the large $N$ expansion. We show that the method of subgraphs generates diagrammatic expansions for the conformal 3-point correlators, and it closely relates to the operator product expansions in momentum space. We verify the subgraph expansions of the conserved current 3-point correlators using the exact results in 3D. We demonstrate that the multi-loop 3-point Feynman integrals can be significantly simplified by taking the subgraph expansions. Due to the constraints from conformal symmetry, it suffices to keep the first few terms of the subgraphs to completely fix the subleading order corrections. We apply this method to compute the $1/N$ corrections to the current correlators $\langle JJJ\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model and the Gross-Neveu-Yukawa model. We also compute the $1/N$ corrections to the coefficients in the current-current-scalar correlators $\langle JJ\sigma_{T}\rangle$ and $\langle JJ\sigma\rangle$ in the critical $O(N)$ vector model. We compare the perturbative result with the bootstrap data and discuss its application for the conductivity near the quantum critical point.

Title: PLaID++: A Preference Aligned Language Model for Targeted Inorganic Materials Design
Authors: Andy Xu, Rohan Desai, Larry Wang, Gabriel Hope, Ethan Ritz
Abstract: Discovering novel materials is critical for technological advancements such as solar cells, batteries, and carbon capture. However, the development of new materials is constrained by a slow and expensive trial-and-error process. To accelerate this pipeline, we introduce PLaID++, a Large Language Model (LLM) fine-tuned for stable and property-guided crystal generation. We fine-tune Qwen-2.5 7B to generate crystal structures using a novel Wyckoff-based text representation. We show that generation can be effectively guided with a reinforcement learning technique based on Direct Preference Optimization (DPO), with sampled structures categorized by their stability, novelty, and space group. By encoding symmetry constraints directly into text and guiding model outputs towards desirable chemical space, PLaID++ generates structures that are thermodynamically stable, unique, and novel at a $\sim$50\% greater rate than prior methods and conditionally generates structures with desired space group properties. Our experiments highlight the effectiveness of iterative DPO, achieving $\sim$115\% and $\sim$50\% improvements in unconditional and space group conditioned generation, respectively, compared to fine-tuning alone. Our work demonstrates the potential of adapting post-training techniques from natural language processing to materials design, paving the way for targeted and efficient discovery of novel materials.

Title: Performance enhancement in Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers by tailoring the relative distance between junctions
Authors: M.A. Gali Labarias, T. Yamada, Y. Nakashima, Y. Urade, J. Claramunt, K. Inomata
Abstract: Josephson traveling wave parametric amplifiers with heterogeneously spaced junctions are theoretically investigated. We consider unit cells with three junctions and characterize their interaction by spatially displaced fields defined by node fluxes. To solve this problem we define the system action and apply the variational principle to obtain the static action, which determines the equations of motion. This work shows that gain and bandwidth can be increased by modifying the relative distance between junctions within the same unit cell, thus increasing the effective nonlinear interaction. We find an optimal sub-unit-cell size ratio, which maximizes both gain and bandwidth, while equally spaced junctions offer minimum performance. Even though this method does not rely on phase-matching, the same device can operate at different pump frequencies, it requires a very large number of JJs to achieve gains above 20 dB. We show that this method can be combined with resonant-phase matching and predicts an ideal gain above 29 dB on a 4 GHz bandwidth with 1998 junctions. Despite possible challenges fabricating devices at the optimal sub-unit-cell size with current technologies, substantial gain increase can still be achieved at sub-optimal sizes.

Title: Vanishing of the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs
Authors: Ippo Orii
Abstract: In $(2+1)$-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs), the action of a global symmetry group on the anyon system is one of the central topics of research. Owing to the subtle categorical nature of anyons, such group actions do not automatically satisfy associativity. The obstruction is captured by a cohomology class, known as the $H^3$ obstruction, whose presence signals a failure of group associativity. In these cases, the symmetry structure is no longer described by an ordinary group, but instead by a $2$-group -- a group-like structure extended by a $1$-form symmetry. In this short note, we prove that the $H^3$ obstruction for time-reversal symmetry always vanishes in abelian bosonic TQFTs.

Title: Two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion: Analysis in time and frequency domains
Authors: Michał Balcerek, Adrian Pacheco-Pozo, Agnieszka Wyłomańska, Krzysztof Burnecki, Diego Krapf
Abstract: This article introduces a novel construction of the two-dimensional fractional Brownian motion (2D fBm) with dependent components. Unlike similar models discussed in the literature, our approach uniquely accommodates the full range of model parameters and explicitly incorporates cross-dependencies and anisotropic scaling through a matrix-valued Hurst operator. We thoroughly analyze the theoretical properties of the proposed causal and well-balanced 2D fBm versions, deriving their auto- and cross-covariance structures in both time and frequency domains. In particular, we present the power spectral density of these processes and their increments. Our analytical findings are validated with numerical simulations. This work provides a comprehensive framework for modeling anomalous diffusion phenomena in multidimensional systems where component interdependencies are crucial.

Title: Gauge Theory and Integrability: An Overview
Authors: Masahito Yamazaki
Abstract: While general quantum field theories (QFTs) have yet to be rigorously defined in mathematics, they have generated new mathematics and have served as a unifying principle connecting different branches of the subject. In 1989, Witten made a profound impact on the mathematical community by systematically constructing knot invariants via the three-dimensional Chern-Simons theory. One of the historical roots of knot invariants was integrable models, whose explanation in terms of QFT remained unsolved for decades. Recently, this problem was solved by a perturbative analysis of the four-dimensional Chern-Simons theory, which provides a novel framework for understanding and unifying many different aspects of integrable models. In this article, we summarize the basic aspects of these developments for non-experts in both physics and mathematics.

Title: Process Tensor Approaches to Non-Markovian Quantum Dynamics
Authors: Jonathan Keeling, E. Miles Stoudenmire, Mari-Carmen Bañuls, David R. Reichman
Abstract: The paradigm of considering open quantum systems -- i.e. focusing only on the system of interest, and treating the rest of the world as an effective environment -- has proven to be a highly effective way to understand a range of quantum systems, across areas of study such as quantum optics, cold atoms, superconducting qubits, and impurities in solid-state systems. A common approach in many of these contexts has been to consider simplified approaches based on the Born and Markov approximations. While these approximations are indeed often appropriate in contexts such as quantum optics, the widespread application of these approximations has been driven more by simplicity than by accuracy. In particular, these Markovian treatments will fail in many cases, such as when coupling to the environment is not weak, when the environment is structured and has resonances, when the system couples to low-frequency modes of the environment, or when the questions of interest involve the propagation of information through the environment. Despite the fact that many real problems are non-Markovian, the Markov approximation is still widely used, as it is often assumed that a fully non-Markovian treatment is too complex to be practical. In this perspective we discuss a recently developed set of techniques that address this challenge. Centering our discussion around the notion of the process tensor, we demonstrate that the generality of the process tensor concept, coupled with efficient tensor-network methods, opens the door to the description of a wide range of observable non-Markovian processes in a wide range of open quantum systems.

Title: On-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in tantalum superconducting circuits on silicon for scalable quantum technologies
Authors: Shima Poorgholam-Khanjari, Paniz Foshat, Mingqi Zhang, Valentino Seferai, Martin Weides, Kaveh Delfanazari
Abstract: The performance and scalability of superconducting quantum circuits are fundamentally constrained by non-equilibrium quasiparticles, which induce microwave losses that limit resonator quality factors and qubit coherence times. Understanding and mitigating these excitations is therefore central to advancing scalable quantum technologies. Here, we demonstrate on-chip microwave sensing of quasiparticles in high-Q {\alpha}-tantalum coplanar waveguide resonators on silicon, operated in the single-photon regime. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal persistent non-equilibrium quasiparticles at millikelvin temperatures, producing a measurable suppression of the internal quality factor (Qi) relative to theoretical expectations. By benchmarking across materials, we find that the quasiparticle density in {\alpha}-Ta is approximately one-third that of NbN at equivalent normalised temperatures (T/Tc), directly correlating with reduced microwave loss. Our methodology establishes a scalable platform for probing quasiparticle dynamics and points towards new routes for engineering superconducting circuits with improved coherence, with impact on qubit readout resonators, kinetic-inductance detectors, and emerging quantum processors and sensors.

Title: Full-scale Microwave SQUID Multiplexer Readout System for Magnetic Microcalorimeters
Authors: M. Neidig, T. Muscheid, R. Gartmann, L. E. Ardila Perez, M. Wegner, O. Sander, S. Kempf
Abstract: The deployment of large cryogenic detector arrays, comprising hundreds to thousands of individual detectors, is highly beneficial for various cutting-edge applications, requiring large statistics, angular resolution or imaging capabilities. The readout of such arrays, however, presents a major challenge in terms of system complexity, parasitic heat load, and cost, which can be overcome only through multiplexing. Among the various multiplexing approaches, microwave SQUID multiplexing currently represents the state of the art, in particular for magnetic microcalorimeter (MMC) readout. In this work, we demonstrate the successful operation of the latest generation of our microwave SQUID multiplexer-based readout system, based on a SQUID multiplexer tailored for MMC readout and a custom full-scale software-defined radio (SDR) electronics, capable of handling up to 400 channels. The system operates reliably across the entire 4-8 GHz frequency band and achieves sufficiently low flux noise levels in flux-ramp-demodulated readout. Our results confirm that our system is fully functional and provides a scalable path towards future large-scale, high-resolution MMC experiments.

Title: Simulation of one and two qubit superconducting quantum gates under the non-Markovian $1/f$ noise
Authors: Yinjia Chen, Shuocang Zhang, Qiang Shi
Abstract: Non-Markovian $1/f$ noise consists a dominant source of decoherence in superconducting qubits, yet its slow nature poses a significant challenge for accurate simulation. Here we develop a hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) framework that enables efficient and reliable modeling of qubit dynamics and gate operations under $1/f$ noise. By using the approach, it is first shown that perturbative quantum master equations may fail to reproduce the correct dephasing dynamics of a qubit coupled to slow baths. We then analyze dynamical decoupling sequences by including effects of finite pulse duration. It is found that different pulse sequences results in different behavior in error accumulation: all X-CPMG sequences exhibit linear scaling with parity effects, Y-CPMG follows quadratic growth, and alternating XY-type sequences can suppress the error accumulation significantly. Finally, we extend the framework to two-qubit cross-resonance (CR) gates, reconstructing the full Choi matrix and Pauli Transfer Matrix (PTM) to identify the incoherent error induced by $1/f$ noise. Together, these results establish HEOM as a robust methodology for simulating the environmental noise in superconducting circuits and provide new insights into error mechanisms in both single- and two-qubit gates.

Title: A Tensor Network Framework for Lindbladian Spectra and Steady States
Authors: Philipp Westhoff, Mattia Moroder, Ulrich Schollwöck, Sebastian Paeckel
Abstract: Quantum systems coupled to (non-)Markovian environments attract increasing attention due to their peculiar physical properties. Exciting prospects such as unconventional non-equilibrium phases beyond the Mermin-Wagner limit, or the environment-assisted, robust preparation of highly entangled states, demand a systematic analysis of quantum many-body phases out of equilibrium. Akin to the equilibrium case, this requires the computation of the low-lying eigenstates of Lindbladians, a problem challenging conventional approaches for simulating quantum many-body systems. Here, we undertake a first step to overcome this limitation and introduce a tensor-network-based framework to compute systematically not only steady states, but also low-lying excited states with unprecedented precision for large, driven quantum many-body systems. Our framework is based on recent advances utilizing complex-time Krylov spaces, and we leverage these ideas to create a toolbox tailored to solve the challenging non-Hermitian eigenvalue problem ubiquitous in open quantum systems. At the example of the interacting Bose-Hubbard model driven by dissipation-assisted hopping, we demonstrate the high efficiency and accuracy, enabling us to perform a reliable finite-size scaling analysis of the spectral gap and demonstrating the existence of anomalous relaxation. This method unlocks the capability of spectral analysis of generic open quantum many-body systems, suitable also for non-Markovian environments.

Title: Continuous cloud position spectroscopy using a magneto-optical trap
Authors: Benedikt Heizenreder, Ananya Sitaram, Sana Boughdachi, Andrew von Hörsten, Yan Xie, Andreas Brodschelm, Florian Schreck
Abstract: We demonstrate a continuous spectroscopy technique with frequency sensitivity well below the natural transition linewidth, while maintaining a locking range hundreds of times larger. The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser, we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to long-term frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.

Title: Emergence of Entropic Time in a Tabletop Wheeler-DeWitt Universe
Authors: Giovanni Barontini
Abstract: We implement an analogue Wheeler-DeWitt mini-universe constituted by a well-isolated atomic Bose-Einstein condensate in a time-independent conservative potential. In exact analogy with the Wheeler-DeWitt framework for the actual universe, our system has the fundamental problem of defining from within a meaningful time variable over which to order the events. Here, we partition the mini-universe into a bright and a dark sector, enabling entropy exchange between them through a potential barrier. We show that the Hamiltonian of the condensate in the bright sector is analogous to the one in canonical minisuperspace models. We define an entropic time and show with experimental data that it is robustly monotonic even when the bright sector undergoes several cycles that begin with a 'big bang' and end with a 'big crunch'. By tuning the barrier height, we control the rate of entropy production and thus the speed of the emergent entropic time and the dynamics of the bright universe. We finally derive an entropic time-dependent Schroedinger equation that could be considered as a generalization of the standard one, and use it to reproduce our data. This work experimentally validates the proposition that time in quantum cosmological models may not be fundamental, but instead emerges from thermodynamic gradients, while establishing a concrete experimental platform for evaluating several aspects of quantum gravity theories.

Abstract: We put forward a novel formulation of the vortex gas model of turbulent circulation statistics to address the challenging case of nonplanar circulation contours. Relying upon a field-theoretical description, statistical moments of the circulation turn out to be functionally dependent on specific {\it{optimal surfaces}} bounded by the circulation loops. Circulation is modeled in the optimal curved spaces with the help of scalar vertex operators that represent the multifractal density fluctuations of Gaussian-correlated vortex structures. We show that minimal surfaces are optimal within the inertial range, but subdominant deviations are expected to become significant for contours with linear dimensions close to the Kolmogorov dissipation length. As a case study, we demonstrate the model's applicability through a Monte Carlo evaluation of the circulation probability distribution function for a nonplanar contour, which is in excellent agreement with results of extensive direct numerical simulations.

Title: Revisiting the Question of Information Content of EXAFS Spectra through a Bayesian Approach
Authors: Lucy Haddad, Diego Gianolio, Andrei Sapelkin
Abstract: Over the last several decades the Shannon-Nyquist criterion has been widely used as a measure of the maximum information content in EXAFS spectra and provided an upper limit on the number of parameters used in fitting data. However, the criterion implicitly assumes independent parameters which is never the case in EXAFS analysis. Here we introduce a new criterion to measure the information content in EXAFS based on Bayesian approach that lifts the above condition. We test the new criterion by fitting the EXAFS spectrum of liquid gallium and demonstrate that not only it does constitute a superior measure of the data information content, but can also provide guidance in data analysis to differentiate between various fitting strategies.

Title: From lines to networks
Authors: Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: Many real-world networks, ranging from subway systems to polymer structures and fungal mycelia, do not form by the incremental addition of individual nodes but instead grow through the successive extension and intersection of lines or filaments. Yet most existing models for spatial network formation focus on node-based growth, leaving a significant gap in our understanding of systems built from spatially extended components. Here we introduce a minimal model for spatial networks, rooted in the iterative growth and intersection of lines-a mechanism inspired by diverse systems including transportation networks, fungal hyphae, and vascular structures. Unlike classical approaches, our model constructs networks by sequentially adding lines across a domain populated with randomly distributed points. Each line grows greedily to maximize local coverage, while subject to angular continuity and the requirement to intersect existing structures. This emphasis on extended, interacting elements governed by local optimization and geometric constraints leads to the spontaneous emergence of a core-and-branches architecture. The resulting networks display a range of non-trivial scaling behaviors: the number of intersections grows subquadratically; Flory exponents and fractal dimensions emerge consistent with empirical observations; and spatial scaling exponents depend on the heterogeneity of the underlying point distribution, aligning with measurements from subway systems. Our model thus captures key organizational features observed across diverse real-world networks, establishing a universal paradigm that goes beyond node-based approaches and demonstrates how the growth of spatially extended elements can shape the large-scale architecture of complex systems.

Title: Symmetry TFTs for Continuous Spacetime Symmetries
Authors: Fabio Apruzzi, Nicola Dondi, Iñaki García Etxebarria, Ho Tat Lam, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We propose a Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) for continuous spacetime symmetries. For a $d$-dimensional theory, it is given by a $(d+1)$-dimensional BF-theory for the spacetime symmetry group, and whenever $d$ is even, it can also include Chern-Simons couplings that encode conformal and gravitational anomalies. We study the boundary conditions for this SymTFT and describe the general setup to study symmetry breaking of spacetime symmetries. We then specialize to the conformal symmetry case and derive the dilaton action for conformal symmetry breaking. To further substantiate that our setup captures spacetime symmetries, we demonstrate that the topological defects of the SymTFT realize the associated spacetime symmetry transformations. Finally, we study the relation to gravity and holography. The proposal classically coincides with two-dimensional Jackiw-Teitelboim gravity for $d=1$ as well as the topological limit of four-dimensional gravity in the $d=3$ case.

Title: Grain boundary-limited thermal transport in suspended thin graphite across an unexplored thickness regime
Authors: Wonjae Jeon, Yu Pei, Xun Li, Lucas Lindsay, Sangyeop Lee, Renkun Chen
Abstract: We present systematic thermal conductivity measurements of suspended thin graphite ribbons, 234-527 nm thick, using a four-probe 3-omega method. Unlike recent reports of phonon hydrodynamics and exceptionally high thermal conductivity in micrometer-thick graphite (Science, 2020),we observe significantly lower thermal conductivity and no signatures of collective phonon flow in this intermediate thickness regime. Instead, our measured thermal conductivity lies between few-layer graphene and bulk this http URL results agree with a first-principles-informed Peierls-Boltzmann transport model with spatially resolved Monte Carlo sampling. Additionally, the temperature for the peak thermal conductivity shifts lower with increasing thickness, due to the interplay of phonon-boundary and phonon-isotope scattering. Incorporating grain boundary scattering into simulations is necessary to replicate the experimental trends. These findings delineate the boundary between ballistic, hydrodynamic, and diffusive transport regimes in graphite, and underscore the dominant role of disorder and geometry in phonon transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials, offering insights for nanoscale thermal management.

Title: Single Particle Spectroscopies of $p$-wave and $d$-wave Interacting Bose Gases in Normal Phase
Authors: Zeqing Wang, Ran Qi
Abstract: Motivated by experiments of interacting quantum gases across high partial wave resonance, we investigated the thermodynamic properties as well as single particle spectrums of Bose gases in normal phase for different interaction strengths both for $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. The equation of state, contact density, momentum distributions, and self-energies of single particle Green's functions are obtained in the spirit of ladder diagram approximations. Radio frequency (RF) spectrum, as an important experimental approach to detect Feshbach molecules or interaction effect, is calculated at different temperatures. A reversed temperature dependence on the BEC side and BCS side is identified for both $p$-wave and $d$-wave interactions. An estimation for the signal of RF spectra under typical experimental conditions is also provided.

Title: Loschmidt echo, emerging dual unitarity and scaling of generalized temporal entropies after quenches to the critical point
Authors: Stefano Carignano, Luca Tagliacozzo
Abstract: We show how the Loschmidt echo of a product state after a quench to a conformal invariant critical point and its leading finite time corrections can be predicted by using conformal field theories (CFT). We check such predictions with tensor networks, finding excellent agreement. As a result, we can use the Loschmidt echo to extract the universal information of the underlying CFT including the central charge, the operator content, and its generalized temporal entropies. We are also able to predict and confirm an emerging dual-unitarity of the evolution at late times, since the spatial transfer matrix operator that evolves the system in space becomes unitary in such limit. Our results on the growth of temporal entropies also imply that, using state-of-the art tensor networks algorithms, such calculations only require resources that increase polynomially with the duration of the quench, thus providing an example of numerically efficiently solvable out-of-equilibrium scenario.

Title: Magneto-optical transport in tilted type-I multi-Weyl semimetals in the presence of orbital magnetic moment
Authors: Amit Gupta
Abstract: The magneto-optical transport of gapless type-I tilted single Weyl semimetals exhibits suppression of total magnetoconductivities in the presence of orbital magnetic moment(OMM) in linear and nonlinear responses (Yang Gao et al., Phys. Rev. B {\bf 105}, 165307 (2022)). In this work, we extend our study to investigate magnetoconductivities in gapless type-I tilted multi-Weyl semimetals(mWSMs) within the semiclassical Boltzmann approach and show the differences that arise compared to single-Weyl semimetals.

Title: Geometry-Dependent Defect Merging Induces Bifurcated Dynamics in Active Networks
Authors: Fan Yang, Shichen Liu, Hao Wang, Heun Jin Lee, Rob Phillips, Matt Thomson
Abstract: Cytoskeletal networks can repair defects to maintain structural integrity. However, the mechanisms and dynamics of defect merging remain poorly understood. Here we report a geometry-tunable merging mechanism in microtubule-motor networks initiated by active crosslinking. We directly generate defects using a light-controlled microtubule-motor system in O-shaped and V-shaped networks, and observe that the defects can self-close. Combining theory and experiment, we find that the V-shaped networks must overcome internal elastic resistance in order to zip up cracks, giving rise to a bifurcation of dynamics dependent on the initial opening angle of the crack: the crack merges below a critical angle and opens up at larger angles. Simulation of a continuum model reproduces the bifurcation dynamics, revealing the importance of overlapping boundary layers where free motors and microtubules can actively crosslink and thereby merge the defects. We also formulate a simple elastic-rod model that can qualitatively predict the critical angle, which is tunable by the network geometry.

Title: Deconfined quantum critical points in fermionic systems with spin-charge separation
Authors: Niccolò Baldelli, Arianna Montorsi, Sergi Julià-Farré, Maciej Lewenstein, Matteo Rizzi, Luca Barbiero
Abstract: Deconfined quantum critical points are intriguing transition points not predicted by the Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson symmetry-breaking paradigm which are usually identified by the appearance of a continuous phase transition between locally ordered phases. Here, we reveal the presence of deconfined quantum critical points with unexplored properties. Contrary to previously known examples, we show that the phenomenon of spin-charge separation peculiar to interacting low dimensional fermions can allow for the appearance of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. We first infer this point by performing a field theory analysis of generic one-dimensional fermionic systems in the low energy limit. Subsequently, we derive a microscopic model where phase transitions between different locally ordered phases can take place. Here, by performing a numerical analysis we explicitly derive, among others, the gaps, local order parameters and correlation functions behavior, supporting the presence of partially gapped deconfined quantum critical points. Our results thus provide new interesting insights on the widely investigated topic of quantum phase transitions.

Title: Simulating the two-dimensional $t-J$ model at finite doping with neural quantum states
Authors: Hannah Lange, Annika Böhler, Christopher Roth, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: Simulating large, strongly interacting fermionic systems remains a major challenge for existing numerical methods. In this work, we introduce Gutzwiller projected hidden fermion determinant states (G-HFDS) to simulate the strongly interacting limit of the Fermi-Hubbard model, namely the $t$-$J$ model, across the entire doping regime. We demonstrate that the G-HFDS achieve energies competitive with matrix product states (MPS) on lattices as large as $10 \times 10$ sites while using several orders of magnitude fewer parameters, suggesting the potential for efficient application to even larger system sizes. This remarkable efficiency enables us to probe low-energy physics across the full doping range, providing new insights into the competition between kinetic and magnetic interactions and the nature of emergent quasiparticles. Starting from the low-doping regime, where magnetic polarons dominate the low energy physics, we track their evolution with increasing doping and different next-nearest neighbor hopping amplitudes through analyses of spin and polaron correlation functions as well as the Fermi surface. Our findings demonstrate the potential of determinant-based neural quantum states with inherent fermionic sign structure, opening the way for simulating large-scale fermionic systems at any particle filling.

Title: Scalable Sondheimer oscillations driven by commensurability between two quantizations
Authors: Xiaodong Guo, Xiaokang Li, Lingxiao Zhao, Zengwei Zhu, Kamran Behnia
Abstract: The electrical conductivity of metallic crystals exhibits size effects when the electron mean free path exceeds the sample thickness. One such phenomenon, known as Sondheimer oscillations, was discovered decades ago. These oscillations, periodic in magnetic field, have been hitherto treated with no reference to Landau quantization. Here, we present a study of longitudinal and transverse conductivity in cadmium single crystals with thicknesses ranging from 12.6 to 475 $\mu$m, and demonstrate that the amplitude of the first ten oscillations is determined by the quantum of conductance and a length scale that depends on the sample thickness, the magnetic length and the Fermi surface geometry. We argue that this scaling is unexpected in semiclassical scenarios and it arises from the degeneracy of the momentum derivative of the cross-sectional area $A$ along the orientation of the magnetic field $\frac{\partial A}{\partial k_z}$ in cadmium, which couples Landau quantization to the discretization of $k_z$ imposed by the finite sample thickness. We show that the oscillating component of the conductivity is uniquely governed by fundamental constants and the ratio of two degeneracies, which acts as an inverted filling factor. Our conjecture is supported by the absence of such scaling in thin copper crystals.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation of THz photons in an optical microcavity with Landau-quantized electrons
Authors: Timofey V. Maximov, Norayr A. Asriyan, Igor L. Kurbakov, Yurii E. Lozovik
Abstract: We present a theoretical model for a coherent terahertz radiation source based on Bose-Einstein condensate of incoherently pumped microcavity photons. Energy relaxation is provided by inelastic photon scattering on a two-dimensional electron gas in magnetic field. The proposed setup evades the standard lasing mechanisms: neither population inversion nor light wave amplification is utilized. We study the kinetics of photon condensation and describe a semiconductor-crystal based device.

Title: Two-dimensional moiré phonon polaritons
Authors: Hao Shi, Chu Li, Ding Pan, Xi Dai
Abstract: Phonon polaritons (PhPs) are hybrid light-matter modes. We investigate them in two-dimensional (2D) materials with twisted moiré structures, revealing that the moiré potential creates a new class of `moiré PhPs'. These exhibit a fundamental spectral reconstruction into multiple branches and, crucially, electromagnetic wavefunctions that are nano-patterned by the superlattice. Through numerical simulations based on realistic lattice models, we confirm the existence of these intriguing modes. The inherent nanoscale structuring produces a robust, spatially varying near-field response, establishing moiré superlattices as a platform for engineering light-matter interactions.

Title: Non-adiabatic linear response in open quantum systems
Authors: Xiaotian Nie, Wei Zheng
Abstract: Adiabatic theorem and non-adiabatic corrections have been widely applied in modern quantum technology. Recently, non-adiabatic linear response theory has been developed to probe the many-body correlations in closed systems. In this work, we generalize the non-adiabatic linear response theory to open quantum many-body systems. We show that, similar to the closed case, the first-order deviation from the instantaneous steady state is memoryless -- it depends only on the final parameters and not on the initial state or ramping path. When ramping the Hamiltonian, the linear response of observables is governed by the derivative of the retarded Green's function, as in closed systems. In contrast, ramping the dissipation gives rise to a different response, characterized by a high-order correlation function defined in the steady state. Our results offer a compact and physically transparent formulation of non-adiabatic response in open systems, and demonstrate that ramping dynamics can serve as a versatile tool for probing many-body correlations beyond equilibrium.

Title: Unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystal
Authors: Takeru Yokota, Tatsuhiko N. Ikeda
Abstract: Prethermal discrete time crystals (DTCs) are a novel phase of periodically driven matter that exhibits robust subharmonic oscillations without requiring disorder. However, previous realizations of prethermal DTCs have relied on the presence of polarization, either spontaneous or induced. Here, we introduce a new class of prethermal DTCs termed ``unpolarized prethermal discrete time crystals'' (UPDTCs) that arise without any uniform/staggered polarization and propose an experiment to observe them in current trapped-ion quantum simulators. By studying a model of trapped ions using a quantum circuit simulator, we demonstrate that robust period-doubled dynamics can persist in the autocorrelation function of the staggered magnetization, even though its expectation value does not exhibit such dynamics. The period-doubled dynamics is not explained by the classical picture of flipping spins but by quantum fluctuations. We establish that UPDTCs are exponentially long-lived in the high-frequency driving regime, a hallmark of prethermalization. These results expand the known phenomenology and mechanism of prethermal time crystals and underscore the role of quantum effects in stabilizing novel nonequilibrium phases.

Title: Direct Imaging of Hydrogen-Driven Dislocation and Strain Field Evolution in a Stainless Steel Grain
Authors: David Yang, Mujan Seif, Guanze He, Kay Song, Adrien Morez, Benjamin de Jager, Dmytro Nykypanchuk, Ross J. Harder, Wonsuk Cha, Edmund Tarleton, Ian K. Robinson, Felix Hofmann
Abstract: Hydrogen embrittlement (HE) poses a significant challenge to the durability of materials used in hydrogen production and utilization. Disentangling the competing nanoscale mechanisms driving HE often relies on simulations and electron-transparent sample techniques, limiting experimental insights into hydrogen-induced dislocation behavior in bulk materials. This study employs in situ Bragg coherent X-ray diffraction imaging to track three-dimensional dislocation and strain field evolution during hydrogen charging in a bulk grain of austenitic 316 stainless steel. Tracking a single dislocation reveals hydrogen-enhanced mobility and relaxation, consistent with dislocation dynamics simulations. Subsequent observations reveal dislocation unpinning and climb processes, likely driven by osmotic forces. Additionally, nanoscale strain analysis around the dislocation core directly measures hydrogen-induced elastic shielding. These findings experimentally validate theoretical predictions and offer mechanistic insights into hydrogen-driven dislocation behavior. The quantified nanoscale phenomena serve as critical inputs for multiscale modeling frameworks to predict bulk material responses and accelerate the development of HE-resistant alloys.

Title: Correlated helimagnetic configuration in a nonsymmorphic magnetic nodal semimetal
Authors: Xi Luo, Yu-Ge Chen, Ye-Min Zhan, Yue Yu
Abstract: Nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetal materials such as ReAlX (Re=rare earth, X=Si/Ge) provide a unique opportunity to explore the correlated phenomena between Weyl fermions and nontrivial magnetic configurations. To be specific, we study a lattice model in which the magnetic configuration is determined by the competition among ferromagnetic (FM) interaction, the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction, and the Kondo coupling $K_0$ to the Weyl fermion. Both quantum and finite-temperature phase transitions between FM and correlated nesting helical configurations are found. Different from the uncorrelated helimagnet that decouples from the Weyl fermions, this correlated helimagnet induces a magnetic Brillouin zone with a $K_0$-dependent nesting in the band structure of the conduction electrons instead of the monopole-like Weyl cone. By measuring the current induced by the chiral magnetic effect on the conduction electron with nesting Weyl nodes, one can distinguish the correlated nesting helical order from the ferromagnetism because the chiral magnetic effect is considerably suppressed in the former case. These properties we find here may explain the experimental observations in ReAlX.

Abstract: Antiferromagnetic states with spin-split electronic structure give rise to novel spintronic, magnonic, and electronic phenomena despite (near-) zero net magnetization. The simplest odd-parity spin splitting - $p$-wave - was originally proposed to emerge from a collective instability in interacting electron systems. Recent theory identifies a distinct route to realise $p$-wave spin-split electronic bands without strong correlations, termed $p$-wave magnetism. Here we demonstrate an experimental realisation of a metallic $p$-wave magnet. The odd-parity spin splitting of delocalised conduction electrons arises from their coupling to an antiferromagnetic texture of localised magnetic moments: a coplanar spin helix whose magnetic period is an even multiple of the chemical unit cell, as revealed by X-ray scattering experiments. This texture breaks space inversion symmetry but preserves time-reversal ($T$) symmetry up to a half-unit-cell translation - thereby fulfilling the symmetry conditions for $p$-wave magnetism. Consistent with theoretical predictions, our $p$-wave magnet exhibits a characteristic anisotropy in the electronic conductivity. Relativistic spin-orbit coupling and a tiny spontaneous net magnetization further break $T$ symmetry, resulting in a giant anomalous Hall effect (AHE, $\sigma_{xy}>600\,$S/cm, Hall angle $>3\,\%$), for an antiferromagnet. Our model calculations show that the spin nodal planes found in the electronic structure of $p$-wave magnets are readily gapped by a small perturbation to induce the AHE.

Title: Boundary operator product expansion coefficients of the three-dimensional Ising universality class
Authors: Dorian Przetakiewicz, Stefan Wessel, Francesco Parisen Toldin
Abstract: Recent advances in conformal field theory and critical phenomena have focused on the characterization of boundary or defects in a conformally invariant system. In this Letter we study the critical behavior of the three-dimensional Ising universality class in the presence of a surface, realizing the ordinary, the special, and the normal universality classes. By combining high-precision Monte Carlo simulations of an improved model, where leading scaling corrections are suppressed, with a finite-size scaling analysis informed by conformal field theory, we determine unbiased, accurate estimates of universal boundary operator product expansion coefficients of experimental relevance. Furthermore, we improve the value of the scaling dimension of the surface field at the special transition by the estimate $\hat{\Delta}_\sigma = 0.3531(3)$.

Title: Systematic Mapping of Altermagnetic Magnons by Resonant Inelastic X-Ray Circular Dichroism
Authors: Nikolaos Biniskos, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Stefano Agrestini, David Sviták, Ke-Jin Zhou, Jiří Pospíšil, Petr Čermák
Abstract: Altermagnets, a unique class of magnetic materials that combines features of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, have garnered attention for their potential in spintronics and magnonics. While the electronic properties of altermagnets have been well studied, characterizing their magnon excitations is essential for fully understanding their behavior and enabling practical device applications. In this work, we introduce a measurement protocol combining resonant inelastic X-ray scattering with circular polarization and azimuthal scanning to probe the chiral nature of the altermagnetic split magnon modes in CrSb. This approach circumvents the challenges posed by domain averaging in macroscopic samples, allowing for precise measurements of the polarization and energy of the magnons in individual antiferromagnetic domains. Our findings demonstrate a pronounced circular dichroism in the magnon peaks, with an azimuthal dependence that is consistent with the theoretical predictions and the $g$-wave symmetry. By establishing a reliable and accessible method for probing altermagnetic magnons, this work opens new avenues for fundamental studies of these collective excitations and for developing next-generation magnonic device applications.

Abstract: Aging limits lithium-ion battery lifetime and must be understood to improve durability and performance, requiring a detailed understanding of how aging alters the availability of cyclable lithium and the integrity of active particles. In this work, (de)lithiation mechanisms are examined and spatially-resolved at the microscale in aged graphite electrodes dismounted from a large format graphite/LiFePO4-Li(NiCoAl)O2 cell at 70% remaining capacity. A multi-technique workflow is employed, combining electrochemical methods with post-mortem structural and morphological analyses, and introducing synchrotron microX-ray 2D diffraction imaging as a technique to probe aged graphite, applied at C-rates from C/5 to C. In-plane and through-plane heterogeneities in graphite dynamics are evidenced, showing the presence of inactive regions localized in two dimensions. In these areas, particles are either disconnected (irreversibly lost) or kinetically limited (reactivated at a slow C-rate), with dead or slow particles exhibiting a wide range of compositions, from x = 0 to x = 1 in LixC6. These inactivated graphite particles are found to be heterogeneously distributed throughout the depth of the aged negative electrode. In particular, the most inactivated region localizes at the negative electrode-separator interface, correlating to overworking graphite near the separator.

Title: Spin and Charge Transport Mediated by Fractionalized Excitations
Authors: Alexey Ermakov, Alessandro Principi
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport in systems composed of itinerant electrons and localized magnetic moments of a Kitaev quantum spin liquid (QSL) phase. For example, $\alpha-{\rm RuCl}_3$ either intrinsically doped or in proximity to graphene. Our analysis reveals distinct temperature-dependent transport behaviors due to the QSL gap and the Majorana excitation spectrum, which are greatly enhanced when the velocities of itinerant-electrons and QSL excitations become comparable. These transport characteristics could potentially be employed to reveal the fractionalized excitations of the spin liquid.

Title: Low-energy structure and topology of the two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model
Authors: Nayara G. Gusmão, Germán Blesio, Armando Aligia, Walber H. Brito, Maria C. O. Aguiar, Karen Hallberg
Abstract: We investigate the Mott transition in a two-band Hubbard-Kanamori model using Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) with the Density Matrix Renormalization Group (DMRG) and the Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) as impurity solvers. Our study focuses on the case where the intraorbital and interorbital Coulomb interactions are equal (U = U2) and the Hund's coupling is absent (J = 0). Spectral analysis confirms the absence of an orbital-selective Mott transition (OSMT), even in systems with significantly different bandwidths (t1 and t2 for the wide and narrow bands, respectively), indicating a simultaneous Mott transition in both bands. Notably, the NRG results reveal the emergence of a pseudo-gap-like feature and a central peak in the narrow band, whose characteristics depend on the hopping parameter t2. These spectral features may serve as precursors to OSMT in more realistic systems with finite Hund's coupling (J > 0). Furthermore, in the Mott insulating phase, the self-energies of both bands diverge, suggesting that the Mott transition represents a topological phase transition. Our results highlight the crucial role of accurate impurity solvers in capturing the density of states and detailed spectral structures.

Title: Electronic Energy Scales of Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) using High-resolution X-ray Scattering
Authors: Chamini Pathiraja, Jayajeewana N. Ranhili, Deniz Wong, Christian Schulz, Yi-De Chuang, Yu-Cheng Shao, Di-Jing Huang, Hsiao-Yu Huang, Amol Singh, Byron Freelon
Abstract: Chromium tri-halides Cr$X_3$ ($X$ = Cl, Br, and I) have recently become a focal point of research due to their intriguing low-temperature,layer-dependent magnetism that can be manipulated by an electric field. This makes them essential candidates for spintronics applications. These magnetic orders are often related to the electronic structure parameters, such as spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Hund's coupling ($J_H$), $p-d$ covalency, and inter-orbital Coulomb interactions. Accurately determining such parameters is paramount for understanding Cr$X_3$ physics. We have used ultra high-resolution resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) spectroscopy to study Cr$X_3$ across phase transition temperatures. Ligand field multiplet calculations were used to determine the electronic structure parameters by incorporating the crystal field interactions in a distorted octahedral with $C_3$ symmetry. These methods provide the most detailed description of Cr$X_3$ magneto-optical and electronic energetic (terms) to date. For the first time, the crystal field distortion parameters $D\sigma$ and $D\tau$ were calculated, and the energies of $d$ orbitals have been reported. Our RIXS spectroscopic measurements reveal a clear energy separation between spin-allowed quartet states and spin-forbidden doublet states in Cr$X_3$. The role of SOC in Cr $2p$ orbitals for the spin-flip excitations has been demonstrated. The determined 10$Dq$ values are in good agreement with the spectrochemical series, and Racah B follows the Nephelauxetic effect. Such precise measurements offer insights into the energy design of spintronic devices that utilize quantum state tuning within 2D magnetic materials.

Title: Tunable spin-orbit splitting in bilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ quantum devices

Abstract: Bilayer graphene (BLG)-based quantum devices represent a promising platform for emerging technologies, such as quantum computing and spintronics. However, their intrinsically weak spin-orbit coupling (SOC) complicates spin and valley manipulation. Integrating BLG with transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) enhances the SOC via proximity effects. While this enhancement has been demonstrated in 2D-layered structures, 1D and 0D nanostructures in BLG/TMD remain unrealized, with open questions regarding SOC strength and tunability. Here, we investigate quantum point contacts and quantum dots in two BLG/WSe$_2$ heterostructures with different stacking orders. Across multiple devices, we reproducibly demonstrate spin-orbit splitting up to 1.5 meV - more than 1 order of magnitude higher than in pristine BLG. Furthermore, we show that the induced SOC can be tuned in situ from its maximum value to near-complete suppression via the perpendicular electric field. This enhancement and in situ tunability establish the SOC as a control mechanism for dynamic spin and valley manipulation.

Title: Operator Formalism for Noncollinear Functionals in Multicollinear Approach
Authors: Xiaoyu Zhang, Taoni Bao
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin-orbit coupling and noncollinear magnetism requires noncollinear density functionals within the two-component generalized Kohn-Sham (GKS) framework, yet constructing and implementing noncollinear functionals remains challenging. Recently, a well-defined methodology called the multicollinear approach was proposed to extend collinear functionals into noncollinear ones. While previous research focuses on its matrix representation, the present work derives its operator formalism. We implement these new equations in our noncollinear functional ensemble named NCXC, which is expected to facilitate compatibility with most DFT software packages. Since the multicollinear approach was proposed for solving nonphysical properties and mathematical singularities in noncollinear functionals, we validate its accuracy in practical periodic systems, including noncollinear magnetism in spin spirals, band structures in topological insulators, and band gaps in semiconducting inorganic materials.

Title: Enhanced barocaloric performance in neopentyl plastic crystal solid solutions
Authors: Frederic Rendell-Bhatti, Melony Dilshad, Celine Beck, Markus Appel, Alba Prats, Eamonn T. Connolly, Claire Wilson, Lewis Giannelli, Pol Lloveras, Xavier Moya, David Boldrin, Donald A. MacLaren
Abstract: The discovery of colossal barocaloric effects in neopentyl glycol (NPG) makes plastic crystals promising candidates for solid-state refrigerants that have lower environmental impact than traditional vapour compression fluids. However, optimising operational temperatures and low-pressure operability remains challenging without diminishing parameters including the accessible latent heat. Here, we implement a strategy to improve the viability of NPG derivatives as barocaloric refrigerants. We blend pentaglycerine with NPG to lower the phase transition temperature, then dope the blend with just 2% pentaerythritol to improve the phase transition reversibility. In comparison with NPG, this ternary system has a seven-fold increase in reversible isothermal entropy change ($|\Delta S_{it,rev}|$ = 13.4 J kg$^{-1}$ K$^{-1}$) and twenty-fold increase in operational temperature span ($\Delta T_{span}$ = 18 K) at pressures of 1 kbar. Synchrotron x-ray diffraction reveals that the temperature range of the first-order phase transition is broadened because the intermolecular hydrogen bond network is disrupted by the presence of molecular dopants. Dynamic effects are revealed by quasielastic neutron scattering, which shows reduced activation energies for the molecular rotational modes underpinning the entropic component of the barocaloric effect. We propose that exploiting the large compositional phase space of multi-component molecular blends is an effective strategy for designing practicable molecular BCs.

Abstract: EuAuSb is a triangular-lattice Dirac semimetal in which a topological Hall effect has been observed to develop in association with a magnetically-ordered phase. Our single-crystal neutron diffraction measurements have identified an incommensurate helical order in which individual ferromagnetic Eu$^{2+}$ layers rotate in-plane by $\sim$120$^{\circ}$ from one layer to the next. An in-plane magnetic field distorts the incommensurate order, eventually leading to a first order transition to a state that is approximately commensurate and that is continuously polarized as the bulk magnetization approaches saturation. From an analysis of the magnetic diffraction intensities versus field, we find evidence for a dip in the ordered in-plane moment at the same field where the topological Hall effect is a maximum, and we propose that this is due to field-induced quantum spin fluctuations. Our electronic structure calculations yield exchange constants compatible with the helical order and show that the bands near the Fermi level lose their spin degeneracy via a mechanism similar to that in the collinear altermagnets. We find that, unlike the even symmetry seen in the altermagnets, the spin-splitting in EuAuSb has odd-wave symmetry similar to that recently found in a number of coplanar magnetic materials.

Title: Novel bipartite entanglement in the quantum dimer magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$

Abstract: The quantum dimer magnet, with antiferromagnetic intradimer and interdimer Heisenberg exchange between spin-1/2 moments, is known to host an up/down - down/up singlet ground state when the intradimer exchange is dominant. Rare-earth-based quantum dimer systems with strong spin-orbit coupling offer the opportunity for tuning their magnetic properties by using magnetic anisotropy as a control knob. Here, we present bulk characterization and neutron scattering measurements of the quantum dimer magnet Yb$_2$Be$_2$SiO$_7$. We find that the Yb$^{3+}$ ions can be described by an effective spin-1/2 model at low temperatures and the system does not show signs of magnetic order down to 50 mK. The magnetization, heat capacity, and neutron spectroscopy data can be well-described by an isolated dimer model with highly anisotropic exchange that stabilizes a singlet ground state with a wavefunction up/up - down/down or up/up + down/down. Our results show that strong spin-orbit coupling can induce novel entangled states of matter in quantum dimer magnets.

Title: Ultraviolet/infrared mixing-driven suppression of Kondo screening in the antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal
Authors: Francisco Borges, Peter Lunts, Sung-Sik Lee
Abstract: We study a magnetic impurity immersed in the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic quantum critical metal (AFQCM), using the field-theoretic functional renormalization group. Critical spin fluctuations represented by a bosonic field compete with itinerant electrons to couple with the impurity through the spin-spin interaction. At long distances, the antiferromagnetic electron-impurity (Kondo) coupling dominates over the boson-impurity coupling. However, the Kondo screening is weakened by the boson with an increasing severity as the hot spots connected by the magnetic ordering wave-vector are better nested. For $v_{0,i} \ll 1$, where $v_{0,i}$ is the bare nesting angle at the hot spots, the temperature $T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}$ below which Kondo coupling becomes $O(1)$ is suppressed as $\frac{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{AFQCM}}}{\log \Lambda/T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}} \sim \frac{g_{f,i}}{v_{0,i} \log 1/v_{0,i} }$, where $T_K^{\mathrm{FL}}$ is the Kondo temperature of the Fermi liquid with the same electronic density of states, and $g_{f,i}$ is the boson-impurity coupling defined at UV cutoff energy $\Lambda$. The remarkable efficiency of the single collective field in hampering the screening of the impurity spin by the Fermi surface originates from a ultraviolet/infrared (UV/IR) mixing: bosons with momenta up to a UV cutoff actively suppress Kondo screening at low energies.

Title: Extended Yard Sale model of wealth distribution on Erdős-Rényi random networks
Authors: Nicolás Vazquez Von Bibow, Juan I. Perotti
Abstract: Excessive wealth concentration can undermine economic and social development. Random Asset Exchange (RAE) models provide valuable tools to investigate this phenomenon. Assuming that economic systems may operate optimally near the critical point of a continuous phase transition, the Extended Yard Sale (EYS) model introduced by Boghosian et al.~[Physica A 476, 15 (2017)] offers a compelling framework. This model captures the interplay between wealth redistribution and accumulation, exhibiting a continuous phase transition marked by a broad wealth distribution at criticality, separating a condensed phase -- where a microscopic fraction of agents holds a macroscopic share of total wealth -- from a distributed phase with a light-tailed wealth distribution. While the original EYS model assumes fully connected interactions, this work introduces and studies a networked variant where agents interact over Erdős-Rényi random networks. The analysis combines Monte Carlo simulations with Quenched Mean Field and Mean Field approximations, exploring a variety of interaction and taxation schemes. A scaling analysis shows that, although the networked model also undergoes a continuous phase transition, it leads to local wealth condensation rather than the global condensation found in the fully connected case. These results deepen our understanding of wealth dynamics in structured populations and may help inform the development of more effective economic and social policies.

Title: Engineering topological exciton structures in two-dimensional semiconductors by a periodic electrostatic potential
Authors: Na Zhang, Wang Yao, Hongyi Yu
Abstract: We propose to engineer topological exciton structures in layered transition metal dichalcogenides through hybridizing different Rydberg states, which can be induced by a periodic electrostatic potential remotely imprinted from charge distributions in adjacent layers. Topological phase diagrams are obtained for potentials with various strengths and wavelengths. We find the lowest band of the interlayer exciton can become topologically nontrivial, which exhibits a small bandwidth as well as quantum geometries well suited for realizing the bosonic fractional Chern insulator. For monolayer excitons, topological bands and in-gap helical edge states can emerge near the energy of 2p states.

Title: Signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction of a doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry
Authors: Gregorio Staffieri, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: We investigate a hole-doped Mott insulator in a slab geometry using the dynamical cluster approximation. We show that the enhancement of the correlation strength at the surface results in the remarkable evolution of the layer-projected Fermi surface, which exhibits hole-like pockets in the superficial layers, but gradually evolves into a single electron-like surface in the innermost layers. We further analyze the behavior of the Friedel oscillations induced by the surface and identify distinct signatures of the Fermi surface reconstruction as function of hole-doping. In addition, we introduce a computationally tractable quantity that diagnoses the same Fermi surface variation by the concurrent breakdown of Luttinger's theorem. Both the latter quantity and the Friedel oscillations serve as reliable indicators of the change in Fermi surface topology, without the need for any periodization in momentum space.

Title: Repulsive particle interactions enable selective information processing at cellular interfaces
Authors: Jenna Elliott, Hiral Shah, Roman Belousov, Gautam Dey, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Living systems relay information across membrane interfaces to coordinate compartment functions. We identify a physical mechanism for selective information transmission that arises from the sigmoidal response of surface-bound particle densities to spatial features in adjacent external structures through a non-uniform binding energy. This mechanism implements a form of spatial thresholding, enabling the binary classification of external cues. Expansion microscopy measurements of nuclear pore complex distributions in S. arctica show signatures of such physical thresholding.

Title: Analytical solution of coupled self-consistency and linearised Usadel equations for the dirty superconductor at proximity effect
Authors: S.S. Seidov, N.G. Pugach
Abstract: In this manuscript we analytically solve the linearised Usadel equation and the self-consistency equation, defining the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition of a superconducting film under the proximity effect in the dirty limit. This is a system of coupled differential and integral equations for the anomalous Green function and the order parameter of the superconductor. The proximity effect defines the boundary conditions. The formal solution of the system is found for the general case of the linearized boundary conditions defined by the proximity effect, reducing the set of equations to an eigenvalue problem. The latter defines the critical temperature of the superconducting phase transition and the spatial distributions of the anomalous Green function and the superconducting order parameter.

Title: Polarization-Sensitive Imaging in Magnetic Environments
Authors: Nejc Blaznik, Dries van Oosten, Peter van der Straten
Abstract: Nondestructive spin-resolved imaging of ultracold atomic gases requires calculating the differences of the refractive indices seen by two circular probe polarizations. Perfect overlap of the two images, corresponding to two different polarizations, is required well below the feature size of interest. In this paper, we demonstrate that the birefringence of atoms in magnetic field gradients results in polarization-dependent aberrations in the image, which deteriorates the overlap. To that end, we develop a model that couples atomic tensor polarizability with position-dependent spin orientation and yields aberration predictions for accumulated phase shifts in arbitrary field geometries. Applied to data from an ultra-cold atomic cloud trapped in a Ioffe-Pritchard trap, the model quantitatively reproduces the observed distortion across a range of temperatures. A residual offset of $\sim1\;\mu\mathrm{m}$ remains even under uniform field conditions, likely due to optical asymmetries. For images obtained through off-axis holography, the full complex field of the probe enables post-processing removal of all magnetically induced aberrations through a single numerically calculated Fourier-space phase mask.

Title: Computation and Sensitivity Analysis of the Deformation-Gradient Tensor Reconstruction in Dark-Field X-ray Microscopy
Authors: Brinthan Kanesalingam, Darshan Chalise, Carsten Detlefs, Leora Dresselhaus-Marais
Abstract: Spatially resolved strain measurements are crucial to understanding the properties of engineering materials. Although strain measurements utilizing techniques such as transmission electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction offer high spatial resolution, they are limited to surface or thin samples. X-ray diffraction methods, including Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging and X-ray topography, enable strain measurements deep inside bulk materials but face challenges in simultaneously achieving both high spatial resolution and large field-of-view. Dark-field X-ray Microscopy (DFXM) offers a promising solution with its ability to image bulk crystals at the nanoscale while offering a field-of-view approaching a few hundred $\mu$m. However, an inverse modeling framework to explicitly relate the angular shifts in DFXM to the strain and lattice rotation tensors is lacking. In this paper, we develop such an inverse modeling formalism. Using the oblique diffraction geometry, enabling access to noncoplanar symmetry-equivalent reflections, we demonstrate that the reconstruction of the full deformation gradient tensor ($\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$) is possible. We also develop the computational framework to both forward calculate the anticipated angular shifts and reconstruct the average $\mathbf{F^{(g)}}$ for an individual pixel from DFXM experiments. Finally, utilizing the established formalism and computational framework, we present methods for sensitivity analysis to relate individual components of the rotation or strain tensor to specific angles of DFXM. The developed sensitivity analysis also enables explicit computation of the errors associated with the reconstruction of each component. The formalism, the computational framework, and the sensitivity analysis established in this paper should assist both the interpretation of past DFXM experiments and the design of future DFXM experiments.

Title: Edge modes of topological Mott insulators and deconfined quantum critical points
Authors: Yuhai Liu, Toshihiro Sato, Disha Hou, Zhenjiu Wang, Wenan Guo, Fakher F. Assaad
Abstract: Topology and anomalies lead to edge modes that can interact with critical bulk fluctuations. To study this setup, pertaining to boundary criticality, we consider a model exhibiting a deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) between a dynamically generated quantum spin Hall state (i.e.a topological Mott insulator) and an s-wave superconductor. For the topological Mott insulator, the bulk Goldstone modes are shown to be irrelevant at the helical Luttinger liquid fixed points. The deconfined quantum critical point is an instance of an emergent anomaly, and we observe a sharp localized edge state at this point. The sharpness of the edge mode is consistent with an ordinary phase in which electronic edge modes decouple from critical edge bosonic fluctuations. At the DQCP, the scaling dimension of the edge electron shows a jump, a feature argued to be a signature of the emergent anomaly. Our results are based on large-scale auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo this http URL also carry out calculations for the Kane-Mele-Hubbard model to confirm spectral features of the ordinary and extraordinary-log phases in the vicinity of the bulk critical point.

Title: Elastic Metastability: Thermally Activated Snap-through Transitions in Nanostructures
Authors: Renjie Zhao, Yiquan Zhang, Chenglin Luo
Abstract: The morphological snap-through transition of a bistable elastic structure typically requires external loading, unless it is miniaturized to the nanoscale, where thermal fluctuations play a significant role. We propose that metastability can emerge in microscopic elastic systems when coupled to a thermal environment, giving rise to thermally activated transitions between metastable configurations. Using atomistic simulations combined with rare event methods, we demonstrate that snap-through events can occur as well-defined thermally activated transitions in a geometrically constrained graphene nanoribbon. Well-tempered metadynamics is employed to determine the transition energetics and pathways. Notably, the temperature dependence of the transition rate constant is accurately described by generalized transition state theory in terms of the Landau free energy. This study introduces a theoretical framework for understanding elastic metastability, extends reaction rate theory to nanomechanical systems, and suggests strategies for designing temperature-responsive nanodevices.

Title: Optical selection rules of topological excitons in flat bands
Authors: Mara Lozano, Hong-Yi Xie, Bruno Uchoa
Abstract: Topological excitons are superpositions of electron-hole pair states, characterized by an envelope function with finite vorticity in momentum space. This vorticity is determined by the underlying topology of the electronic bands. We derive the optical selection rules for topological excitons in flat bands, considering different topological two-band models: a family of Hamiltonians with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, the flattened BHZ model for a single spin and the flattened Haldane model. We derive the selection rules for these three models accounting for short-range interactions. We also consider the non-hydrogenic spectrum of excitons in the single-spin flattened BHZ model with Coulomb interactions. We show that for the case of two flat bands with skyrmion pseudo-spin textures, all excitons are bright, and the handedness of the light that couples to them is fixed by the vorticity of the pseudo-spin texture. For the single-spin flattened BHZ model, we show that bright excitons couple to circularly polarized light, regardless of the range of the interactions. In the flattened Haldane model, topological excitons couple to elliptically polarized light. We obtain the phase diagram for the polarization of light in this model as a function of microscopic parameters of the Hamiltonian. Our results demonstrate how band topology affects exciton properties, offering a framework for predicting light-matter interactions in topological materials with flat bands.

Title: Depletion-Induced Interactions Modulate Nanoscale Protein Diffusion in Polymeric Crowder Solutions

Abstract: Macromolecular crowding plays a crucial role in modulating protein dynamics in cellular and in vitro environments. Polymeric crowders such as dextran and Ficoll are known to induce entropic forces, including depletion interactions, that promote structural organization, but the nanoscale consequences for protein dynamics remain less well understood. Here, we employ megahertz X-ray photon correlation spectroscopy (MHz-XPCS) at the European XFEL to probe the dynamics of the protein ferritin in solutions containing sucrose, dextran, and Ficoll. We find that depletion-driven short-range attractions combined with long-range repulsions give rise to intermediate-range order (IRO) once the polysaccharide overlap concentration $c^*$ is exceeded. These IRO features fluctuate on microsecond to millisecond timescales, strongly modulating the collective dynamics of ferritin. The magnitude of these effects depends sensitively on crowder type, concentration, and molecular weight. Normalizing the crowder concentration by $c^*$ reveals scaling behavior in ferritin self-diffusion with a crossover near 2$c^*$, marking a transition from depletion-enhanced mobility to viscosity-dominated slowing. Our results demonstrate that bulk properties alone cannot account for protein dynamics in crowded solutions, underscoring the need to include polymer-specific interactions and depletion theory in models of crowded environments.

Title: Emergent collective heat engines from neighborhood-dependent thermal reservoirs
Authors: Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: We introduce and analyze a class of heat engines composed of interacting units, in which the thermal reservoir is associated with the neighborhood surrounding each unit. These systems can be mapped onto stochastic opinion models and are characterized by collective behavior at low temperatures, as well as different types of phase transitions, marked by spontaneous symmetry breaking and classifications that depend on topology and neighborhood. For the case of contact with two thermal baths, equivalent to each unit having $k = 4$ nearest neighbors, the system can be tuned to operate at maximum power without sacrificing efficiency or increasing dissipation. These quantities are related by the general expression $ \beta_2 {\cal P} \eta_c =-J_4 \eta \sigma$ when the worksource stems from different interaction energies. The heat engine placed in contact with more than three reservoirs is more revealing, showing that the intermediate thermal reservoir can be conveniently adjusted to achieve the desired compromise between power, efficiency, and dissipation. The influence of lattice topology (regular and random-regular networks), its relationship with collective operation as well as the distinct ratios between the temperatures of the thermal baths, has also been investigated.

Title: Spectral Methods in Complex Systems
Authors: Francesco Caravelli
Abstract: These notes offer a unified introduction to spectral methods for the study of complex systems. They are intended as an operative manual rather than a theorem-proof textbook: the emphasis is on tools, identities, and perspectives that can be readily applied across disciplines. Beginning with a compendium of matrix identities and inversion techniques, the text develops the connections between spectra, dynamics, and structure in finite-dimensional systems. Applications range from dynamical stability and random walks on networks to input-output economics, PageRank, epidemic spreading, memristive circuits, synchronization phenomena, and financial stability. Throughout, the guiding principle is that eigenvalues, eigenvectors, and resolvent operators provide a common language linking problems in physics, mathematics, computer science, and beyond. The presentation is informal, accessible to advanced undergraduates, yet broad enough to serve as a reference for researchers interested in spectral approaches to complex systems.

Title: Dissipative Quantum Chaos unveiled by Stochastic Quantum Trajectories
Authors: Filippo Ferrari, Luca Gravina, Debbie Eeltink, Pasquale Scarlino, Vincenzo Savona, Fabrizio Minganti
Abstract: We define quantum chaos and integrability in open quantum many-body systems as a dynamical property of single stochastic realizations, referred to as quantum trajectories. This definition relies on the predictions of random matrix theory applied to the subset of the Liouvillian spectrum involved in each quantum trajectory. Our approach, which we name spectral statistics of quantum trajectories (SSQT), enables a natural distinction between transient and steady-state quantum chaos as general phenomena in open setups. We test the generality and reliability of the SSQT criterion on several dissipative systems, further showing that an open system with a chaotic structure can evolve towards either a chaotic or integrable steady state. We apply our theoretical framework to two driven-dissipative bosonic systems. First, we study the driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model, an example of quantum simulator, clarifying the interplay of integrability, transient, and steady-state chaos across its phase diagram. Our analysis shows the existence of an emergent dissipative quantum chaotic phase, whereas the classical and semi-classical limits display integrable behavior. In this regime, chaos arises from the quantum and classical fluctuations associated with the dissipation mechanisms. Second, we investigate dissipative quantum chaos in the dispersive readout of a transmon qubit: a measurement technique ubiquitous in superconducting-based quantum hardware. Through the SSQT, we distinguish regimes where the performance of the measurement instrument can be connected to the integrable or chaotic nature of the underlying driven-dissipative bosonic system. Our work offers a general understanding of the integrable and chaotic dynamics of open quantum systems and paves the way for the investigation of dissipative quantum chaos and its consequences on state-of-the-art noisy intermediate-scale quantum devices.

Title: Superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars
Authors: Hao-Fu Zhu, Guo-Zhu Liu, Jing-Rong Wang, Xufen Wu
Abstract: The neutron star starts to cool down shortly after its birth by emitting neutrinos. As it becomes cold enough, the Cooper pairs of neutrons are formed, triggering a superfluid transition. Previous studies on neutron superfluidity focused on finite-temperature transitions, with little attention paid to the potentially important quantum critical phenomena associated with superfluidity. Here, we provide the first theoretical analysis of superfluid quantum criticality, concentrating on its impact on neutron star cooling. Extensive calculations found that superfluidity occurs within a finite range of neutron star density $\rho$. The density serves as a nonthermal parameter for a superfluid quantum phase transition. In a broad quantum critical region, gapless neutrons are strongly coupled to the quantum critical fluctuations of the superfluid order parameter. We handle this coupling using both perturbation theory and renormalization group methods and find that it leads to non-Fermi liquid behavior, which yields a logarithmic $T\ln(1/T)$ correction to the neutron specific heat $c_{\mathrm{n}}\propto T$ and also dramatically alters the neutrino emissivity. Quantum critical phenomena emerge much earlier than the onset of superfluidity and persist throughout almost the entire lifetime of a neutron star. At low temperatures, these phenomena coexist with superfluidity in the neutron star interior but occupy different layers. We incorporate superfluid quantum criticality into the theoretical description of neutron star cooling and show that it substantially prolongs the thermal relaxation time. By varying the strength of superfluid fluctuations and other quantities, we obtain an excellent fit to the observed cooling data of a number of neutron stars. Our results indicate an intriguing correlation between superfluid quantum criticality and the thermal evolution of neutron stars.

Title: Emergent broadband polarization entanglement from electronic and phononic Stokes-anti-Stokes indistinguishability
Authors: Diego Sier, Lucas Valente, Tiago A. Freitas, Marcelo F. Santos, Carlos H. Monken, Raul Corrêa, Ado Jorio
Abstract: Recently [PRA 108, L051501 (2023)], it was shown that in a centrosymmetric cubic system, two photons from a broadband intense laser field can be converted into a pair of Stokes and anti-Stokes (SaS) entangled photons. While the previous work was based on symmetry arguments, here we present a fully quantum theory for the SaS scattering that properly explains, quantitatively describes, and provides a means to predict its spectral and polarization properties (for diamond). We also explore the possibilities offered by such system, designing an entanglement map based on changes in the light-matter system. In particular, we show how the broadband polarization entanglement, that emerges from the interference between electronic and phononic degrees of freedom in the SaS scattering, depends on parameters such as Stokes-anti-Stokes Raman shift, scattering geometry and laser bandwidth, opening the avenue of exploration of such phenomenon in information processing.

Title: Envelope representation of Hamilton-Jacobi equations from spin glasses
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen
Abstract: Recently, [arXiv:2311.08980] demonstrated that, if it exists, the limit free energy of possibly non-convex spin glass models must be determined by a characteristic of the associated infinite-dimensional non-convex Hamilton-Jacobi equation. In this work, we investigate a similar theme purely from the perspective of PDEs. Specifically, we study the unique viscosity solution of the aforementioned equation and derive an envelope-type representation formula for the solution, in the form proposed by Evans in [doi:https://doi.org/10.1007/s00526-013-0635-3]. The value of the solution is expressed as an average of the values along characteristic lines, weighted by a non-explicit probability measure. The technical challenges arise not only from the infinite dimensionality but also from the fact that the equation is defined on a closed convex cone with an empty interior, rather than on the entire space. In the introduction, we provide a description of the motivation from spin glass theory and present the corresponding results for comparison with the PDE results.

Title: Monte Carlo study on Heisenberg model with local dipolar interaction
Authors: Etsuko Itou, Akira Matsumoto, Yu Nakayama, Toshiki Onagi
Abstract: Aharony and Fisher showed that non-local dipolar effects in magnetism destabilize the Heisenberg fixed point in real ferromagnets, leading to a new fixed point, called the dipolar fixed point. The non-perturbative nature of the new fixed point, however, has not been uncovered for many decades. Inspired by the recent understanding that the dipolar fixed point is scale-invariant but not conformal invariant, we perform the Monte Carlo simulation of the local Heisenberg-dipolar model on the lattice of $40^3$ by introducing the local cost function parameterized by a parameter $\lambda$ and study its critical exponents, which should become identical to the dipolar fixed point of Aharony and Fisher in the infinite coupling limit $\lambda = \infty$. We find that the critical exponents become noticeably different from those of the Heisenberg fixed point for a finite coupling constant $\lambda=8$ (e.g. $\nu=0.601(2)(^{+0}_{-2})$ in the local Heisenberg-dipolar model while $\nu=0.712(1)(^{+3}_{-0})$ in the Heisenberg model), and the spin correlation function has a feature that it becomes divergence-free, implying the lack of conformal invariance.

Title: Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps
Authors: Mohammadrahim Kazemzadeh, Banghuan Zhang, Tao He, Haoran Liu, Zihe Jiang, Zhiwei Hu, Xiaohui Dong, Chaowei Sun, Wei Jiang, Xiaobo He, Shuyan Li, Gonzalo Alvarez-Perez, Ferruccio Pisanello, Huatian Hu, Wen Chen, Hongxing Xu
Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.

Title: Analytic theory of dropout regularization
Authors: Francesco Mori, Francesca Mignacco
Abstract: Dropout is a regularization technique widely used in training artificial neural networks to mitigate overfitting. It consists of dynamically deactivating subsets of the network during training to promote more robust representations. Despite its widespread adoption, dropout probabilities are often selected heuristically, and theoretical explanations of its success remain sparse. Here, we analytically study dropout in two-layer neural networks trained with online stochastic gradient descent. In the high-dimensional limit, we derive a set of ordinary differential equations that fully characterize the evolution of the network during training and capture the effects of dropout. We obtain a number of exact results describing the generalization error and the optimal dropout probability at short, intermediate, and long training times. Our analysis shows that dropout reduces detrimental correlations between hidden nodes, mitigates the impact of label noise, and that the optimal dropout probability increases with the level of noise in the data. Our results are validated by extensive numerical simulations.

Title: Nonabelian ferromagnets with three-body interactions
Authors: Alexios P. Polychronakos, Konstantinos Sfetsos
Abstract: We study the thermodynamics of nonabelian ferromagnets consisting of atoms in the fundamental representation of $SU(N)$ and interacting with two-body and three-body interactions. Using a mean field approach, we uncover an intricate phase structure, depending on the relative strength and sign of the two-body and three-body coupling constants. In the case where two-body interactions are ferromagnetic and three-body ones are antiferromagnetic, we uncover a rich cascade of phase transitions, the appearance of phases with two distinct polarization directions being the most striking novel feature. Our results are relevant to magnetic systems where higher-body interactions cannot be neglected.

Title: Computing excited eigenstates using inexact Lanczos methods and tree tensor network states
Authors: Madhumita Rano, Henrik R. Larsson
Abstract: To understand the dynamics of quantum many-body systems, it is essential to study excited eigenstates. While tensor network states have become a standard tool for computing ground states in computational many-body physics, obtaining accurate excited eigenstates remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop an approach that combines the inexact Lanczos method, which is designed for efficient computation of excited states, with tree tensor network states (TTNSs). We demonstrate our approach by computing excited vibrational states for three challenging problems: (1) 122 states in two different energy intervals of acetonitrile (12-dimensional), (2) Fermi resonance states of the fluxional Zundel ion (15-dimensional),and (3) selected excited states of the fluxional and very correlated Eigen ion (33-dimensional). The proposed TTNS inexact Lanczos method is directly applicable to other quantum many-body systems.

Title: Universal Multistate Kinetic Models for the In-Silico Discovery of Thermally Activated Delayed Fluorescence Emitters
Authors: Yue He, Daniel Escudero
Abstract: Many thermally activated delayed fluorescence (TADF) emitters exhibit complex photophysical behaviors that cannot be fully captured by the conventional three state model (S0, S1, T1). The lack of kinetic models that incorporate vibronic coupling effects and high lying excited states has long limited the systematic understanding and rational design of these materials. To address this, we developed KinLuv, an extended multistate kinetic model that includes higher lying excited states (S2, T2), and accounts for the Herzberg Teller (HT) vibronic coupling in the rate constant calculations. Applied to two representative TADF emitters, i.e., DOBNA and DiKTa, KinLuv successfully predicts photoluminescence quantum yields (PLQY) and prompt/delayed fluorescence lifetimes in good agreement with reported experimental results. These findings highlight that incorporating HT vibronic coupling effects and higher lying excited states is essential for quantitatively modeling TADF mechanisms and guiding the design of high performance emitters.

Title: A Further Comparison of TD-DMRG and ML-MCTDH for Nonadiabatic Dynamics of Exciton Dissociation
Authors: Weitang Li, Jiajun Ren, Jun Yan
Abstract: Tensor network methods, such as time-dependent density matrix renormalization group (TD-DMRG) and multi-layer multiconfiguration time-dependent Hartree (ML-MCTDH), are powerful tools for simulating quantum dynamics. While both methods are theoretically exact in the limit of large bond dimensions, a recent study reported up to 60% discrepancy in their calculations for exciton dissociation. To resolve this inconsistency, we conduct a systematic comparison using Renormalizer, a unified software framework for matrix product states (MPS) and tree tensor network states (TTNS). By revisiting the benchmark P3HT:PCBM heterojunction model, we show that the observed discrepancies arise primarily from insufficient bond dimensions. By increasing bond dimensions, we first reduce the difference to less than 10%. Further refinement using an extrapolation scheme and an optimized tensor network structure lowers the difference to approximately 2%. Our results confirm both methods converge to numerically exact solutions when bond dimensions are adequately scaled. This work not only validates the reliability of both methods but also provides high-accuracy benchmark data for future developments in quantum dynamics simulations.

Title: Noise-induced Zeno-like effect in a spin-chain quantum battery
Authors: Maulana M. Fajar, Beta N. Pratiwi, Subur Pramono, Gagus K. Sunnardianto, Ahmad R. T. Nugraha
Abstract: Quantum batteries, which are energy-storage or state-storage devices that exploit unique quantum effects, are sensitive to environmental noise. Here, we demonstrate that suitably engineered noise can induce a "Zeno-like" stabilization effect of the charging process in a spin-chain quantum battery within the Heisenberg XYZ model. Focusing on a system size N=6, which balances computational cost and storage capacity, we find that the ergotropy-to-energy ratio W(t)/E_B(t) attains a maximum value of about 0.99 at a certain time parameter value. Then, by varying the noise strength in each channel, we find that not only does decoherence merely degrade performance but it may also stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the high noise strength regime. For instance, the phase-flip channel slows charging and reduces charging power, but its discharging behavior releases energy and ergotropy more slowly, allowing the battery to be used for longer times compared to bit-flip and bit-phase-flip channels. In contrast, the bit-flip channel enables fast charging, but yields low storage and rapid energy release. Remarkably, the bit-phase-flip channel can combine the advantages of both bit-flip and phase-flip channels in the high-noise-strength regime. The bit-phase-flip channel supports accelerated charging together with enhanced storage capacity, while its discharging behavior resembles that of the bit-flip channel with rapid energy release. These results reveal that, under sufficiently strong noise, environmental decoherence induces a Zeno-like stabilization, allowing it to achieve enhanced charging performance and to stabilize stored energy and ergotropy in the spin-chain quantum battery.
