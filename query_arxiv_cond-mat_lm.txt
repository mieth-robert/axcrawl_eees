Abstract: Recent experimental investigations have demonstrated that doping a semiconductor is a route to increase the thermal boundary conductance at metal/semiconductor interfaces. In this work, the influence of the electrical properties on heat transfer across metal/doped semiconductor junctions is investigated. Specifically, thermal boundary conductance at the interfaces between p- and n-doped silicon and titanium is measured by employing frequency-domain photothermal radiometry under varying external conditions. The influence of the doping level of the semiconductor, the barrier height, and the space charge area is analyzed. In particular, a 40% increase in the interface thermal conductance with the application of a current at n-doped silicon/titanium interfaces is reported. The enhancement of the thermal boundary conductance is explained by the shrinking of the surface charga area induced by the electric current. This study opens the way to modulating interfacial heat transfer at metal/semiconductor interfaces through fine tuning of electrical effects.

Title: Singular three-point density correlations in two-dimensional Fermi liquids
Authors: Pok Man Tam, Charles L. Kane
Abstract: We characterize a singularity in the equal-time three-point density correlations that is generic to two-dimensional interacting Fermi liquids. In momentum space where the three-point correlation is determined by two wavevectors $\mathbf{q}_1$ and $\mathbf{q}_2$, the singularity takes the form $|\mathbf{q}_1\times\mathbf{q}_2|$. We explain how this singularity is sharply defined in a long-wavelength collinear limit. For a non-interacting Fermi gas, the coefficient of this singularity is given by the quantized Euler characteristic of the Fermi sea, and it implies a long-range real space correlation favoring collinear configurations. We show that this singularity persists in interacting Fermi liquids, and express the renormalization of the coefficient of singularity in terms of Landau parameters, for both spinless and spinful Fermi liquids. Implications for quantum gas experiments are discussed.

Title: 3D Unconventional Superconductivity in Bulk LaO
Authors: Zhifan Wang, Jingkai Bi, Jiayuan Zhang, Wenmin Li, Yuxuan Liu, Dao-Xin Yao, Zheng Deng, Changqing Jin, Yifeng Han, Man-Rong Li
Abstract: Lanthanum-based compounds are cornerstones of superconductivity research, yet the La-5d orbitals typically remain empty spectator states far above the Fermi level (EF). While superconductivity has been induced in LaO up to 5.37 K in tensile epitaxy films, the intrinsic ground state of the bulk phase has remained controversial mostly due to synthetic challenges, with early reports suggesting a metallic nature. Here we report the high-pressure and high-temperature synthesis of pure bulk rock-salt LaO and unveil its intrinsic type-II superconductivity with a transition temperature (TC) of ~6 K at ambient pressure. The bulk TC is further enhanced to 6.9 K in La1-xYxO at x = 0.10, where Y doping leads to lattice contraction (chemical pressing) and a remarkable increase in electron carrier concentration. Strikingly, applying physical pressure further enhances the TC to a maximum of 12.7 K at 20 GPa, the highest TC in lanthanum monochalcogenides LaX (X = S, Se, Te, and O) to date. This pressure dependence is diametrically opposed to the behavior observed in films, and occurs despite a pressure-induced reduction in the density of states at EF - a trend that sharply contradicts the conventional phonon-mediated BCS mechanism. Our first-principles calculations reveal that compressive strain modifies the crystal field splitting to enhance La-5d/O-2p hybridization, fostering a three-dimensional multi-pocket Fermi surface favorable for spin/orbital fluctuation-mediated pairing. This work clarifies the intrinsic superconductivity of bulk LaO and provides a foundation for designing new rare-earth-based superconductors with higher TC

Title: Magnetoelectric Raman Force on Shear Phonons in a Frustrated van der Waals Bilayer Magnet
Authors: Wolfram Brenig
Abstract: We show that the concept of coherent phonon generation by second order response to incident electric laser fields, which is a hallmark of pump-probe spectroscopy on conventional solids, can be expanded to include frustrated quantum magnets. For that purpose, we analyze the Raman force on the shear phonons of a frustrated magnetoelectric bilayer spin system. The bilayer is a stacked triangular magnet, motivated by recently emerging type-II van der Waals multiferroic transition metal dihalides and comprises a spin system which allows for incommensurate spiral order. The magnon excitations are treated by linear spin wave theory. In the spiral state, a finite electric polarization is obtained from the spin-current interaction which induces a coupling of the magnons to the electric field. Scattering of the bilayer shear phonons from the magnons is derived from a magnetoelastic energy. In this scenario, a mixed three-point response function for the Raman force is evaluated. We find it to be strongly anisotropic and very sensitive to the magnon lifetime.

Title: A Kinetic Phase-Field Model of Diffusion Bonding: A Nonlocal Approach to Interface Coalescence
Authors: Maryam Khodadad, Noel Walkington, Suresh Kalyanam, Matteo Pozzi, Kaushik Dayal
Abstract: Conventional phase-field models often drive solid-solid interfaces to coalesce when in close proximity. This feature limits their use for processes like diffusion bonding, where the interfaces might need to remain distinct under certain thermodynamic conditions. We develop a kinetic phase-field model to address this problem, using an evolution equation based on a geometric conservation law for interfaces, rather than the gradient descent evolution that is typical in phase-field modeling. This formulation enables us to specify complex kinetic laws, and we use this to incorporate a physically-motivated geometric criterion to control interface merging. This criterion, based on nonlocal higher-derivative curvature invariants of the phase field, can be temperature-dependent, allows for a range of behaviors from complete coalescence to the preservation of distinct boundaries. Simulations show controlled bonding kinetics, demonstrating capabilities that are not available with existing methods for modeling interfaces that must remain distinct under given thermodynamic conditions.

Title: Electron viscosity and device-dependent variability in four-probe electrical transport in ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors
Authors: Richa P. Madhogaria, Aniket Majumdar, Nishant Dahma, Pritam Pal, Rishabh Hangal, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Arindam Ghosh
Abstract: Hydrodynamic electrons in high-mobility graphene devices have demonstrated great potential in establishing an electronic analogue of relativistic quantum fluid in solid-state systems. One of the key requirements for observing viscous electron flow in an electronic channel is a large momentum-relaxation path, a process primarily limited by electron-impurity/phonon scattering in graphene. Over the past decade, multiple complex device geometries have been successfully employed to suppress momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms; however, experimental observations have been found to be sensitive to the device fabrication process and architecture, raising questions about the signature of electron hydrodynamics itself. Here, we present a study on multiple ultra-clean graphene field-effect transistors (FETs) in a simple, rectangular four-terminal device architecture. Using electrical transport measurements, we have characterised the pristine quality of the graphene FETs and examined the variation of electrical resistance in the doped regime as a function of carrier density and temperature. Our results reveal strong device-dependent variability even in the most simple architecture that we attribute to competing momentum-conserving and momentum-relaxing scattering mechanisms, as well as coupling to contacts. Further, we have proposed a phenomenological method for analysing the results, which yields transport parameters in accordance with recent experiments. This simple experimental strategy and analysis can serve as an efficient tool for extracting the viscous electronic contribution in state-of-the-art high-mobility graphene FETs.

Title: How Continuous Symmetry Stabilizes the Ordered Phase of Polar Flocks
Authors: Omer Granek, Hugues Chaté, Yariv Kafri, Sunghan Ro, Alexandre Solon, Julien Tailleur
Abstract: We study the stability of the ordered phase of compressible polar flocks against the nucleation of counter-propagating droplets, using a combination of analytical theory, microscopic and hydrodynamic simulations. For discrete-symmetry flocks, such droplets are known to always grow and propagate, making the ordered phase metastable. We explain how, on the contrary, continuous symmetry can stabilize the ordered phase at small enough noise by destabilizing the leading edge of growing droplets. Flocking models with continuous symmetries thus have a lower critical dimension than their discrete-symmetry counterparts, in contrast to equilibrium physics.

Title: BaFe2Se3 a quasi-unidimensional non-centrosymmetric superconductor

Abstract: The spin-ladder compounds of the BaFe2X3 (X = chalcogen) family may be viewed as dimensional reductions (along stripe-like motifs) of the two-dimensional iron-based pnictide planes extensively studied since 2006. Remarkably, despite their reduced dimensionality, these materials retain the capacity for unconventional ground states, exemplified by the emergence of superconductivity in \bfse\ under applied pressure beyond 10 GPa, following a structural phase transition at 4 GPa. Here, we report a comprehensive investigation combining high-resolution single-crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared spectroscopy, and ab initio calculations, which together elucidate the true crystallographic nature of this pressure-induced superconducting phase. While X-ray diffraction alone reveals a symmetry lowering from the widely accepted orthorhombic Cmcm group to a monoclinic structure, it lacks sufficient sensitivity to resolve the precise space group. By integrating vibrational spectroscopy with density functional theory, we provide unambiguous evidence that the high-pressure phase is non-centrosymmetric, adopting the polar space group P2_1. These findings not only revise the structural assignment of \bfse\ in its superconducting state but also establish its non-centrosymmetric character (an essential ingredient for potential unconventional pairing mechanisms- thereby opening new perspectives on the interplay between lattice symmetry, dimensionality, and superconductivity in iron-based materials.

Title: Spectral boundaries of deterministic matrices deformed by rotationally invariant random non-Hermitian ensembles
Authors: Pierre Bousseyroux, Marc Potters
Abstract: One of the great miracles of random matrix theory is that, in the $N \to \infty$ limit, many otherwise intractable matrix problems with horrendously complicated finite-$N$ expressions admit remarkably simple and elegant asymptotic solutions. In this paper, we illustrate this phenomenon in the context of spectral boundaries (or spectral edges) for deformed random matrices. Specifically, we consider matrices of the form $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$, where $\mathbf{A}$ is a deterministic $N\times N$ matrix (not necessarily Hermitian) and $\mathbf{B}$ is a rotationally invariant random matrix. In the large-$N$ limit, we show that the complex eigenvalue distribution of $\mathbf{A} + \mathbf{B}$ satisfies remarkably simple boundary equations that depend on the $\mathcal{R}_1$ and $\mathcal{R}_2$ transforms of $\mathbf{B}$. We illustrate our results on several explicit random matrix ensembles and support them with numerical simulations.

Title: Strain-Rate- and Line-Length-Dependent Screw Dislocation Glide Mechanisms in BCC Refractory Metals and Alloys
Authors: Subhendu Chakraborty, Liang Qi
Abstract: Plastic flow in body-centered cubic (BCC) metals and dilute/concentrated alloys is governed by the motion of <111> screw dislocations, whose glide is often impeded by cross-kinks (jogs). While existing strengthening models typically treat depinning as defect-assisted cutting or dislocation bowing, the combined strain-rate and dislocation-line-length dependence of cross-kink stability and effective obstacle spacing remains insufficiently resolved at the atomistic scale. Here, we combine conventional molecular dynamics and strain-boost hyperdynamics to investigate screw-dislocation glide in pure Nb and Mo, dilute Nb-Mo alloys, and equiatomic NbMo at 300 K over strain rates from 10^3 to 10^7 s^-1 and dislocation line lengths from 15 to 50 nm. We first demonstrate that low-strain-rate simulations require sufficiently long dislocation lines to capture consistent cross-kink behavior and strength-determining pinning events. Using the 50~nm configurations, we show that cross-kinks form not only in concentrated alloys but also in pure BCC metals, with their stability governed by the relative rates of kink nucleation and migration on primary and cross-slip planes, which differ between Nb- and Mo-rich systems due to distinct core structures and non-Schmid responses. At high strain rates, depinning proceeds predominantly via vacancy-interstitial cluster formation. In contrast, at low strain rates and long line lengths, alternative pathways emerge, including lateral cross-kink migration, three-dimensional forward--backward cross-slip, and prismatic loop formation. The effective obstacle spacing controlling the critical resolved shear stress therefore emerges from coupled thermodynamic roughening and kinetic evolution. These findings highlight the intrinsically rate-, length-, and chemistry-dependent nature of screw-dislocation strengthening in BCC alloys.

Title: Atomically Precise Electron Beam Sculpting of Bilayer h-BN: The Role of Crystallographic Orientation and Milling Strategy
Authors: Ondrej Dyck, Andrew R. Lupini, Ivan Vlassiouk, Matthew Brahlek, Rob Moore, Stephen Jesse
Abstract: Achieving atomic precision in top-down manufacturing remains a fundamental challenge nanofabrication technology. Here, the focused electron beam of a scanning transmission electron microscope is used to demonstrate atomically precise sculpting of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) bilayers, achieving nanoribbons as narrow as 6 Å with atomically smooth edges. The key to this precision lies in understanding how the underlying atomic structure, particularly in twisted bilayer systems, influences the milling process. High-angle annular dark-field imaging combined with multislice simulations reveals distinct intensity signatures that allow identification of different stacking arrangements within moiré patterns. Mathematical analysis of moiré lattices provides a predictive framework for determining optimal cutting directions, with cuts along armchair directions yielding superior edge quality compared to zigzag orientations. Surprisingly, a sequential milling approach, where a small electron beam subscan area is translated during the process, produces significantly better results than parallel milling of the entire target region. To understand these differences we implemented a stochastic milling model that reveals that sequential milling minimizes unwanted exposure to surrounding material through beam tail effects. These findings establish a framework for achieving atomic precision in electron beam sculpting of two-dimensional materials and provide fundamental insights applicable to the broader challenge of top-down nanofabrication.

Title: Ground State of BaFe2S3 from Lattice and Spin Dynamics
Authors: Y. Oubaid, S. Deng, NS. Dhami, M. Verseils, D. Bounoua, A. Forget, D. Colson, P. Foury-Leylekian, M.B. Lepetit, V. Balédent
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between lattice symmetry, phonons, and magnetism in the quasi-one-dimensional ladder compound BaFe$_2$S$_3$ by combining polarized synchrotron infrared spectroscopy, hybrid-functional density functional theory calculations, and inelastic neutron scattering. Lattice-dynamics analysis reveals that the crystal symmetry is lower than previously proposed and is consistent with a $P1$ space group at low temperature. Several infrared-active phonon modes exhibit pronounced anomalies at both the structural transition temperature $T_S \approx 125$--$130$~K and the Néel temperature $T_N \approx 95$~K. First-principles calculations show that the modes affected at $T_S$ predominantly involve displacements that modulate magnetic exchange pathways. Neutron scattering demonstrates that below $T_N$ the magnetic order is three-dimensional, long-ranged, and static. Between $T_N$ and $T_S$, the system displays three-dimensional short-range dynamic magnetic correlations, which disappear above $T_S$. The structural transition thus coincides with the onset of magnetic fluctuations rather than with static magnetic order. Our results indicate that short-range, dynamical magnetic correlations are sufficient to drive a static structural instability, providing a magnetically driven mechanism reminiscent of the iron-pnictide 122 family, yet realized here in a quasi-one-dimensional Mott system. These findings highlight the central role of magnetoelastic coupling in iron-based superconductors beyond the itinerant regime.

Title: Multi-objective optimization and quantum hybridization of equivariant deep learning interatomic potentials on organic and inorganic compounds
Authors: G. Laskaris, D. Morozov, D. Tarpanov, A. Seth, J. Procelewska, G. Sai Gautam, A. Sagingalieva, R. Brasher, A. Melnikov
Abstract: Allegro is a machine learning interatomic potential (MLIP) model designed to predict atomic properties in molecules using E(3) equivariant neural networks. When training this model, there tends to be a trade-off between accuracy and inference time. For this reason we apply multi-objective hyperparameter optimization to the two objectives. Additionally, we experiment with modified architectures by making variants of Allegro some by adding strictly classical multi-layer perceptron (MLP) layers and some by adding quantum-classical hybrid layers. We compare the results from QM9, rMD17-aspirin, rMD17-benzene and our own proprietary dataset consisting of copper and lithium atoms. As results, we have a list of variants that surpass the Allegro in accuracy and also results which demonstrate the trade-off with inference times.

Title: Quantifying Chirality in Helical Polymers via a Geometric Extension of the Kremer-Grest Model
Authors: Michael Grant, Poornima Padmanabhan
Abstract: Chirality in polymeric systems enables a wide range of emergent optical, mechanical, and transport phenomena, yet a unified framework that quantitatively connects molecular-scale geometry to chiral behavior remains lacking. Existing theoretical descriptions typically emphasize either continuum models, such as the helical wormlike chain (HWLC), which neglect intermolecular interactions, or mesophase-level theories, which obscure the role of molecular geometry. In this work, we introduce a comprehensive framework for quantifying chirality in helical polymers by extending the Kremer-Grest bead-spring model to explicitly map intrinsic curvature and torsion onto bond angle and dihedral potentials. We establish direct theoretical relationships between helical parameters such as pitch and radius, and connect them to a normalized, dimensionless chirality characteristic, $\chi$ that captures local geometric correlations absent from conventional HWLC descriptions. Furthermore, using molecular dynamics simulations, we systematically quantify the influence of excluded volume interactions and thermal fluctuations on helical geometry and chirality, dispelling the common assumption that monotonic increases in chirality are associated only with decreasing pitch. Finally, we present a coarse-graining procedure that facilitates a direct comparison between experimental helical polymers and the Kremer-Grest helical chain, demonstrating quantitative agreement across a diverse set of polymer classes. This unified geometric and particle-based description provides a predictive roadmap for selecting and engineering chiral Kremer-Grest models and offers a general platform for designing polymeric materials with controlled and tunable chirality.

Title: The Multi-Scale Dynamics of All-Optical Exchange Bias Reversal
Authors: Floris J. F. van Riel, Andries B. M. Droste, Bert Koopmans, Diana C. Leitao
Abstract: Pinning magnetization in a ferromagnetic thin film is commonly realized through exchange biasing with an adjacent antiferromagnet. Field-cooling from above the Néel temperature is a reliable yet slow re-pinning method in exchange-biased systems. For on-demand reprogrammable devices, localized and rapid exchange bias repinning methods are essential. Recent work has shown that femtosecond laser pulses enable field-free reversal of exchange bias in tailored multilayer stacks. Contrary to field-cooling, our experiments with ultrafast excitation reach hitherto unexplored regimes in the exchange bias setting process. Here, we unravel these observations by considering both ultrafast magnetization dynamics on the femto- to picosecond timescale and slow heat-driven dynamics on millisecond timescales and upwards. We develop a microscopic framework of exchange bias setting in a polycrystalline antiferromagnetic thin film like IrMn that provides a complete description of the observations in our present experiments and those found in literature. We expand the use of our model by identifying material platforms and stack designs that lead to optimized performance, aiding further development of optically reprogrammable devices.

Title: Power attenuation in millimeter-wave and terahertz superconducting rectangular waveguides: linear response, TLS loss, and Higgs-mode nonlinearity
Authors: Takayuki Kubo
Abstract: Superconducting waveguides are a promising platform for ultralow-loss transmission in the millimeter-wave to terahertz band under cryogenic conditions, with potential applications in astronomical instrumentation and emerging quantum technologies. We develop a framework, based on microscopic superconductivity theory, to evaluate the power-flow attenuation constant $\alpha$ of superconducting rectangular waveguides in the $100~\mathrm{GHz}$--THz range, applicable to arbitrary electronic mean free paths $\ell$ from the dirty limit $\ell\ll\xi_0$ to the clean limit $\ell\gg\xi_0$. We also derive an analytical expression for two-level-system (TLS)-induced attenuation $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ in thin native oxide layers within the standard TLS model. Using this framework, we perform numerical evaluations of $\alpha$ for representative materials over standard waveguide sizes from WR15 to WR1. In the high-frequency regime $f \gtrsim 0.5 \Delta/h$, low attenuation favors the clean regime $\ell\gtrsim\xi_0$, indicating that high-purity materials can achieve very low attenuation below their gap frequency. For the TLS contribution, using parameter values representative of native Nb oxides, we find that $\alpha_{\rm TLS}$ can become relevant at sufficiently low temperatures $T/T_c\lesssim 0.1$-0.2, where quasiparticle dissipation is exponentially suppressed. Finally, we extend the discussion to the strong-excitation regime using a recently developed nonlinear-response theory within the Keldysh--Usadel framework of nonequilibrium superconductivity and show that nonlinear dissipation produces a Higgs-mode peak in $\alpha$ near $f\simeq \Delta/h$ via a Kerr-type nonlinearity of the dissipative conductivity. This peak provides a distinct hallmark of the Higgs mode that has been largely overlooked so far.

Title: Finite-size effects and energy alignment in molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions: A systematic comparison of core-hole treatments
Authors: Yu Fujikata, Yasuji Muramatsu, Teruyasu Mizoguchi
Abstract: X-ray absorption near-edge structure (XANES) provides element-specific insight into local electronic and structural environments, but quantitative interpretation of molecular XANES under periodic boundary conditions (PBC) remains challenging due to finite-size effects and core-hole treatments. In this work, we systematically investigate how core-hole approximations and charge compensation schemes affect transition energies, energy alignment, and chemical-shift reproducibility in PBC-DFT-based molecular XANES calculations. Using ethane as a model system, we show that the full core-hole (FCH) approach exhibits pronounced supercell-size dependence originating from interactions between background charge and charged molecules, with transition energies largely changed by leading-order finite-size terms. In contrast, the excited core-hole (XCH) method rapidly converges owing to its neutral final state. We further demonstrate that most finite-size effects in FCH can be removed by Makov-Payne corrections based on multipole expansion of the electrostatic energy of charged supercells under PBC. Furthermore, we propose a simple Fermi-level-based energy correction (EF/2) that provides comparable improvement using only a single supercell. Extending the analysis to an n-alkane series reveals that while intrinsic electronic-structure changes govern peak shifts for small molecules, systematic energy drifts persist in FCH for larger molecules, whereas XCH and FCH+EF/2 remain stable. Finally, for small molecules at the C and N K-edges, XCH and FCH+EF/2 accurately reproduce experimental chemical shifts, whereas uncorrected FCH fails. These results provide practical guidelines for reliable energy alignment and chemical-shift analysis in molecular XANES under PBC, supporting robust applications to molecular, adsorption, and interfacial systems.

Title: Stockmayer Fluid with a Shifted Dipole: Bulk Behavior
Authors: Pierre J. Walker, Ananya Venkatachalam, Samuel Varner, Bilin Zhuang, Zhen-Gang Wang
Abstract: Shifting the point dipole from the center of a Stockmayer particle is a simple geometric modification that has been explored previously, yet its implications for liquid structure, dielectric response, and phase behavior remain incompletely understood. Here, we combine molecular dynamics simulations with analytical theory to provide a unified physical interpretation of how dipole displacement reshapes microscopic correlations and propagates to macroscopic thermodynamic properties. We show that dipole shifting breaks the fore-aft symmetry of the local electrostatic field, producing only modest changes in radial packing but strong alterations in angular structure within the first solvation shell. Enhanced alignment near the dipole head is accompanied by frustrated orientational correlations near the tail, leading to broader angular distributions and a shift away from axial configurations at strong coupling. These structural asymmetries weaken cooperative ordering and result in a systematic reduction of the dielectric constant, despite locally stronger interactions. For large shifts, the dielectric response approaches the Debye limit, indicating effective suppression of dipole-dipole correlations. The same geometric frustration governs vapor-liquid equilibria: while increasing dipole strength raises the critical temperature, even modest shifts disrupt the highly polarized liquid states that emerge at strong coupling and can suppress ferroelectric-like ordering. Predictions from a reparameterized COFFEE theory capture these trends within its domain of validity, highlighting the direct connection between local orientational structure and macroscopic observables. Overall, this work demonstrates that dipole location, not only magnitude, provides a powerful control parameter in dipolar fluids and offers a clear framework for understanding geometric frustration in electrostatic liquids.

Title: Phase transitions in coupled Ising chains and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains
Authors: Yohei Fuji, Sylvain Capponi, Lukas Devos, Philippe Lecheminant
Abstract: We investigate the nature of quantum phase transitions in a (1+1)-dimensional field theory composed of $N$ copies of the Ising conformal field theory interacting via competing relevant perturbations. The field theory governs the competition between a mass term and an interaction involving the product of $N$ order-parameter fields, which is realized, e.g. in coupled Ising chains, two-leg spin ladders, and SO($N$)-symmetric spin chains. By combining a perturbative renormalization group analysis and large-scale matrix-product state simulations, we systematically determine the nature of the phase transition as a function of $N$. For $N=2$ and $N=3$, we confirm that the transition is continuous, belonging to the Ising and four-state Potts universality classes, respectively. In contrast, for $N \ge 4$, our results provide compelling evidence that the transition becomes first order. We further apply these findings to specific lattice models with SO($N$) symmetry, including spin-$1/2$ and spin-$1$ two-leg ladders, that realize a direct transition between an SO($N$) symmetry-protected topological phase and a trivial phase. Our results refine a recent conjecture regarding the criticality of transitions between SPT phases.

Title: Role of atomic vacancies and second-neighbor antiferromagnetic-exchange coupling in a ferromagnetic nanoparticle
Authors: Harun Al Rashid, Muskan Sharma, Shruti, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: Several factors may be responsible for disorder and frustration in a magnetic nanoparticle, including atomic vacancies on the surface and inside, impurity atoms, long-range magnetic exchange coupling, etc. We use Monte-Carlo simulations within the Heisenberg model to examine the role of randomly distributed atomic vacancies and long-range magnetic-exchange coupling on the temperature-dependent magnetic properties of ferromagnetic nanoparticles. In particular, we study the role of the second-neighbor antiferromagnetic exchange coupling and missing atoms inside the particle resulting in broken nearby bonds. We find that both factors may enhance the superparamagnetic behaviors of such particles.

Title: Elucidating Na$_2$KSb band structure: near-band-gap photoemission spectroscopy and DFT calculations
Authors: S. A. Rozhkov, V. V. Bakin, S. V. Eremeev, V. S. Rusetsky, V. A. Golyashov, D. A. Kustov, D. K. Orekhov, H. E. Scheibler, V. L. Alperovich, O. E. Tereshchenko
Abstract: The electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb was studied by a combination of low-energy photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The optical and photoemission quantum efficiency (QE) spectra, along with longitudinal energy distribution curves (EDCs) of multialkali Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes were measured in the temperature range of 80--295 K. The thresholds of various band-to-band transition in Na$_{2}$KSb were observed in the optical and QE spectra of Na$_{2}$KSb(Cs,Sb) photocathodes. The evolution of EDC derivatives with varying photon energy reveals a fine structure related to the emission of two types of electrons: (i) ballistic electrons, which are excited from heavy hole, light hole and split-off valence bands, and (ii) photoelectrons, that are captured in the side valleys of Na$_{2}$KSb conduction band. The analysis of EDCs and QE spectra allowed us to determine the band structure parameters of Na$_{2}$KSb at $T = 80$ K, including the band gap $E_{\text{g}} = 1.52 \pm 0.02$ eV, spin-orbit splitting $\Delta_{\text{SO}} = 0.59 \pm 0.04$ eV and the energy separations between $\Gamma$ and side valleys of the conduction band: $\Delta_{\Gamma-\text{X}1} = 0.41 \pm 0.05$ eV and $\Delta_{\Gamma-\text{X}2} = 0.65 \pm 0.05$ eV. The experimentally determined band gaps and side valley positions, as well as the energies of the final electronic states of optical transitions are in good agreement with the DFT calculations. The obtained data on the hot electron dynamics and electronic band structure of Na$_{2}$KSb are crucial to improve the understanding of the photoemission processes in this material and will contribute to the development of the robust spin-polarized electron sources with multialkali photocathodes.

Title: Graphene FET Process and Analysis Optimization in 200 mm Pilot Line Environment
Authors: Anton Murros, Miika Soikkeli, Anni Virta, Arantxa Maestre, Leire Morillo, Alba Centeno, Amaia Zurutuza, Olli-Pekka Kilpi
Abstract: The maturity of the chemical vapor deposition graphene-based device processing has increased from chip level demonstrations to wafer-scale fabrication in the past few years. Due to this wafer-scale, electrical characterization and analysis of the fabricated devices has become increasingly important to enable extraction of multiple parameters with minimal number of measurements for the quality control purposes critical for industrial uptake of 2D materials-based devices. As a crucial step, we demonstrate optimization of complementary metal-oxide semiconductor (CMOS) back-end-of-line (BEOL) compatible graphene field-effect transistor (GFET) fabrication and analysis including the gate stack, bottom contact, graphene patterning and encapsulation process steps. The analysis methods include atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and most importantly electrical characterization. The electrical characterization focuses on comparing different test structures and extraction methods for mobility, contact resistance, IV-curve hysteresis and doping parameters. The comparison shows that the selected measurement test structures and analysis methods can have a large impact on the extracted values and should thus be considered when comparing data sets between different sources. The analysis shows that the optimized process offers high device yield of 98 % with good doping uniformity, contact resistance and mobility as well as low IV-curve hysteresis values on 200 mm wafers.

Title: Reverse segregation in dense granular flow through narrow vertical channel
Authors: Bhanjan Debnath
Abstract: Controlling flow-induced segregation in a granular mixture is highly relevant to many industrial settings. To enhance mixing or promote segregation, the continuous gravity flow of a bidisperse granular mixture through a series of narrow vertical channels with exit slots is investigated. The bidisperse mixture is composed of two different sizes of particles, but of the same density. In dense flow, segregation occurs, leading to formation of bands. The bands of large particles appear at a distance away from the walls. This finding is in contrast to that in shear-driven segregation in a dense flow where large particles segregate towards the walls. Using a phenomenological model, it has been shown that rolling and bouncing induced segregation is the dominant mechanism. When cylindrical inserts are placed to modify flow patterns, that significantly influences segregation patterns. The symmetrical placement of a cylindrical insert close to the exit slot vanishes the bands and enhances mixing. However, with two inserts placed symmetrically and close to the exit slot, the degree of segregation in the reverse direction is greatly enhanced compared to that without insert. In the former, small particles accumulate in thin regions adjacent to the walls, and large particles comprise the bulk of the domain and the flowing stream. The heap formation above the insert in a narrow channel, when the insert is close to the exit, enhances mixing in one configuration, whereas it amplifies reverse segregation in the other.

Title: Rotational Soft Modes and Octahedral Distortion as Design Principles for Ultralow Thermal Conductivity in Halide Materials
Authors: Yu Wu, Luman Shang, Yufan Liu, Shuming Zeng, Liujiang Zhou, Hao Zhang, Chenhan Liu
Abstract: We establish that ultralow lattice thermal conductivity in halide perovskites and related octahedral framework materials arises from two distinct and complementary mechanisms: (i) halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes that reshape the low-frequency spectrum and intensify phonon scattering, and (ii) static octahedral distortions that further enhance anharmonicity and reduce phonon lifetimes. Using first-principles calculations on CsPbBr3, we demonstrate that Br-Br interactions induce rotational soft modes that decongest the phonon spectrum and enhance three- and four-phonon scattering, strongly suppressing particle-like thermal conductivity (kappa_p). Independently, static octahedral distortions further reduce kappa_p by amplifying anharmonicity while leaving wave-like conductivity (kappa_c) intact. Based on these mechanistic insights, we introduce a geometric distortion factor rho and perform a high-throughput screening that first selects materials with halogen-coordinated octahedral building blocks-ensuring the presence of rotational soft modes-and then identifies those with pronounced distortion. This strategy uncovers TaGaI8 with an ultralow kappa_L = 0.11 W/mK at room temperature. This work establishes halogen-halogen-enabled rotational soft modes and octahedral distortions as transferable design principles for octahedra-containing halides, spanning both extended frameworks and molecular-cluster motifs, for discovering ultralow-kappa_L materials.

Title: How Molecular Motors' Interaction Shapes Flagellar Beat and Its Fluctuations
Authors: F. Fanelli, A. Puglisi
Abstract: The stochastic dynamics of flagellar beating for micro-swimmers, such as flagellated cells, sperms and microalgae, is dominated by a feedback mechanism between flagellar shape and the rate of activation/de-activation of the $N \gg 1$ driving molecular motors. In the context of the so-called rigid filament models, where the axoneme is described by a single degree of freedom $X(t)$, we investigate the effect of direct coupling between the activity dynamics of adjacent motors, parametrized by $K \ge 0$. A functional Fokker-Planck equation for $X$ and the state of the $N$ motors is obtained. In the limit of small coupling $K \ll 1$, we derive a system of equations governing the dynamics of the Fourier modes of the active motor density, obtaining estimates for several observables and the fluctuations' quality factor $Q$. For larger $K$ we resort to numerical simulations. The effect of introducing the coupling $K>0$ is to increase characteristic times and the beating period. Moreover at large $K$s the limit cycle becomes bi-stable, with abrupt avalanches of the motor dynamics. Increasing $K$ is similar to what observed in the case $K=0$ when the confining elastic force is strongly reduced. The quality factor of fluctuations has a non-monotonic behavior: it first increases with $K$, then decreases. This is accompanied by the reduction and eventual disappearance of regions where the fraction of activated motor is nor $0$ neither $1$.

Title: Ghost Embedding Bridging Chemistry and One-Body Theories
Authors: Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Michele Fabrizio
Abstract: Phenomenological rules play a central role in the design of chemical reactions and materials with targeted properties. Typically, these are formulated heuristically in terms of non-interacting orbitals and bands, yet show remarkable accuracy in predicting the complex behavior of intrinsically interacting many-body systems. While their non-interacting formulation makes them easy to interpret, it potentially hinders the development of new rules for systems governed by strong correlation, such as transition metal-based materials. In this work, we present a rigorous framework that allows bridging between fully interacting, even strongly correlated, systems and an effective one-body picture in terms of quasiparticles. Further, we present a computational strategy to efficiently and accurately access the main components of such a description: the embedding approximation of the ghost Gutzwiller Ansatz. We illustrate the capabilities of this quasiparticle formulation on the Woodward-Hoffmann rules, and apply their reformulated version to toy ``reactions'' which exemplify the main scenarios covered by them.

Title: Universal Fine-Grained Symmetry Inference and Enforcement for Rigorous Crystal Structure Prediction
Authors: Shi Yin, Jinming Mu, Xudong Zhu, Lixin He
Abstract: Crystal structure prediction (CSP), which aims to predict the three-dimensional atomic arrangement of a crystal from its composition, is central to materials discovery and mechanistic understanding. Existing deep learning models often treat crystallographic symmetry only as a soft heuristic or rely on space group and Wyckoff templates retrieved from known structures, which limits both physical fidelity and the ability to discover genuinely new material structures. In contrast to retrieval-based methods, our approach leverages large language models to encode chemical semantics and directly generate fine-grained Wyckoff patterns from composition, effectively circumventing the limitations inherent to database lookups. Crucially, we incorporate domain knowledge into the generative process through an efficient constrained-optimization search that rigorously enforces algebraic consistency between site multiplicities and atomic stoichiometry. By integrating this symmetry-consistent template into a diffusion backbone, our approach constrains the stochastic generative trajectory to a physically valid geometric manifold. This framework achieves state-of-the-art performance across stability, uniqueness, and novelty (SUN) benchmarks, alongside superior matching performance, thereby establishing a new paradigm for the rigorous exploration of targeted crystallographic space. This framework enables efficient expansion into previously uncharted materials space, eliminating reliance on existing databases or a priori structural knowledge.

Title: A Fourier-Space Approach to Physics-Informed Magnetization Reconstruction from Nitrogen-Vacancy Measurements
Authors: Alexander Setescak, Florian Bruckner, Dieter Suess, Young-Gwan Choi, Hayden Binger, Lotte Boer, Claire Donnelly, Uri Vool, Claas Abert
Abstract: Reconstructing complex magnetization textures from nitrogen-vacancy (NV) magnetometry stray-field measurements presents a challenging inverse problem. In this work, we introduce a physics-informed method that addresses this by incorporating the full micromagnetic energy directly into the variational formulation. Built on a PyTorch backend, our forward model integrates an auto-differentiable finite-differences micromagnetic framework with FFT-based stray-field calculations and Fourier-space upward continuation. This enables efficient gradient-based optimization via the adjoint method and allows the sensor-sample distance to be treated as an optimization parameter. By doing so, we eliminate the experimental uncertainty arising from unknown NV implantation depths and surface oxidation layers. Validation on synthetic data demonstrates high-fidelity reconstruction of spin textures and precise sensor height estimation. Furthermore, when applied to NV measurements of the van der Waals ferromagnet $Fe_{3-x}GaTe_2$, the method reconstructs the previously unknown NV-sample distance and physically plausible magnetization textures, which accurately reproduce the experimental observations.

Title: Why are there so few non-altermagnetic antiferromagnets?
Authors: Nicola A. Spaldin, Sang-Wook Cheong, Sinead Griffin
Abstract: We review the conditions that cause or prohibit non-relativistic spin splitting of the energy bands in antiferromagnets. We propose that the existence of spin splitting in magnetically ordered systems is the default scenario and outline the criteria that must be met to avoid it. We discuss some of the properties of those special antiferromagnets that succeed in preserving their spin degeneracy.

Title: Vibrational Instabilities in Charge Transport through Molecular Nanojunctions: The Role of Anharmonic Nuclear Potentials
Authors: Martin Mäck, Michael Thoss, Samuel L. Rudge
Abstract: The current-induced vibrational dynamics is a key factor determining the stability of molecular nanojunctions. Beyond conventional Joule heating, a different mechanism caused by nonconservative current-induced forces has been predicted for models with multiple vibrational modes, leading to vibrational instabilities already at low bias voltages. So far, this mechanism has only been investigated in models with harmonic nuclear potentials. Consequently, a natural question is whether this effect can also be observed in more realistic models containing anharmonic nuclear potentials, and, if so, whether it has a measurable impact on observables such as the junction dissociation probability. In this work, we apply a mixed quantum-classical approach based on electronic friction and Langevin dynamics to various anharmonic two-mode systems. By performing Langevin simulations of the vibrational dynamics, we investigate the influence of anharmonicity on instabilities arising from nonconservative forces and the corresponding dissociation dynamics of the junction, as well as steady-state observables, such as the electronic current.

Title: Dielectric Screening in Floquet-Volkov Dressing of Semiconductors
Authors: Quentin Courtade, Umberto Dellasette, Sotirios Fragkos, Stéphane Petit, Dominique Descamps, Yann Mairesse, Samuel Beaulieu
Abstract: Nonequilibrium manipulation of quantum materials via electromagnetic dressing provides an on-demand route to tailoring electronic band structures through Floquet engineering. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy offers a direct means to probe these light-dressed electronic states. In such photoemission experiments, dressing can also occur for quasi-free electrons outside the material, giving rise to Volkov states. In certain cases, strong surface screening reduces the penetration of the driving field into the solid, resulting in Volkov contributions that dominate over Floquet ones. In this work, we systematically investigate the influence of materials' dielectric properties on Floquet-Volkov dressing of semiconductors, focusing on bulk layered van der Waals materials GeS, SnS, and 2H-WSe$_2$. First, by combining a simple model based on Fresnel equations with an electron-scattering description of Volkov amplitudes, we use polarization-dependent Volkov sideband intensities to extract a lower bound for the real part of the materials' dielectric functions, which typically lie between the reported dielectric constants for monolayer and bulk crystals. We demonstrate that increasing the fluence of the pump laser enables the generation of high-order Volkov sidebands which exhibit clear signatures of nonlinear light-matter interactions. Finally, we show that for our experimental geometry, the quasi-transparent nature of semiconductors in below-band-gap driving regime allows the optical pump to propagate within the sample and undergo multiple total internal reflections, producing temporally delayed Volkov replicas in pump-probe measurements via dressing of photoelectrons by evanescent fields. These systematic studies uncover previously unexplored aspects of Floquet-Volkov dressing in solids, highlighting the role of dielectric screening of the driving field.

Title: Interfacial orbital transmission, conversion, and mechanical torque in metals
Authors: Chi Sun, Dongwook Go, Yuriy Mokrousov, Jacob Linder, Aurelien Manchon
Abstract: Interfacial orbital transport remains far less understood than its bulk counterpart despite its central role in orbitronic experiments. Here, we theoretically investigate the transmission and conversion of orbital angular momentum across a metallic interface using a model Hamiltonian incorporating crystal-field effects. We show that an injected orbital dipole moment undergoes pronounced oscillations driven by the crystal field and generates characteristic quadrupole moments determined by the orbital orientation relative to the interface. Unlike spin precession, the dipole relaxes toward a finite value away from the interface. We further quantify interfacial orbital memory loss and demonstrate that orbital absorption produces a sizable mechanical torque obtained from the orbital continuity equation.

Title: Wide-Surface Furnace for In Situ X-Ray Diffraction of Combinatorial Samples using a High-Throughput Approach

Abstract: The combinatorial approach applied to functional oxides has enabled the production of material libraries that formally contain infinite compositions. A complete ternary diagram can be obtained by pulsed laser deposition (PLD) on 100 mm silicon wafers. However, interest in such materials libraries is only meaningful if high-throughput characterization enables the information extraction from the as-deposited library in a reasonable time. While much commercial equipment allows for XY-resolved characterization at room temperature, very few sample holders have been made available to investigate structural, chemical, and functional properties at high temperatures in controlled atmospheres. In the present work, we present a furnace that enables the study of 100 mm wafers as a function of temperature. This furnace has a dome to control the atmosphere, typically varying from nitrogen gas to pure oxygen atmosphere with external control. We present the design of such a furnace and an example of X-ray diffraction (XRD) and fluorescence (XRF) measurements performed at the DiffAbs beamline of the SOLEIL synchrotron. We apply this high-throughput approach to a combinatorial library up to 735 {\textdegree}C in nitrogen and calculate the thermal expansion coefficients (TEC) of the ternary system using custom-made MATLAB codes. The TEC analysis revealed the potential limitations of Vegard's law in predicting lattice variations for high-entropy materials.

Title: Photocatalytic methanol dehydrogenation promoted synergistically by atomically dispersed Pd and clustered Pd
Authors: Zhuyan Gao, Tiziano Montini, Junju Mu, Nengchao Luo, Emiliano Fonda, Paolo Fornasiero, Feng Wang
Abstract: Supported metal in the form of single atoms, clusters, and particles can individually or jointly affect the activity of supported heterogeneous catalysts. While the individual contribution of supported metal to the overall activity of supported photocatalysts has been identified, the joint activity of mixed metal species is overlooked because of their different photoelectric properties. Here, atomically dispersed Pd (Pd1) and Pd clusters are loaded onto CdS, serving as oxidation and reduction sites, respectively, for methanol dehydrogenation. The Pd1 substitutes Cd2+, forming hole-trapping states for methanol oxidation and assisting the dispersion of photo-deposited Pd clusters. Therefore, methanol dehydrogenation on CdS with supported Pd1 and Pd clusters exhibits the highest turnover frequency of 1.14 s-1 based on Pd content, and affords H2 and HCHO with a similar apparent quantum yield of 87 +/- 1% at 452 nm under optimized reaction conditions. This work highlights the synergistic catalysis of supported metal for improved photocatalytic activity.

Title: High-temperature $η$-pairing superconductivity in the photodoped Hubbard model
Authors: Lei Geng, Aaram J. Kim, Philipp Werner
Abstract: We investigate superconductivity emerging in the photodoped Mott insulating Hubbard model using steady-state dynamical mean-field theory implemented on the real-frequency axis. By employing high-order strong-coupling impurity solvers, we obtain the nonequilibrium phase diagram for photoinduced $\eta$-pairing superconductivity with a remarkably high effective critical temperature. We further identify a superconducting gap in the momentum-resolved spectral function and optical conductivity, providing spectroscopic signatures accessible to experiments. Our results highlight a route to a controllable form of high-temperature superconductivity in nonequilibrium strongly correlated systems, fundamentally distinct from the equilibrium $s$-wave pairing state in the attractive Hubbard model or cuprate-like $d$-wave superconductors.

Title: Low-Field Ferroelectric Switching realised by Forced Harmonic Oscillation of Domain Walls
Authors: Niyorjyoti Sharma, Nathan Black, Joseph G. M. Guy, Eftihia Barnes, Kristina M. Holsgrove, Brian J. Rodriguez, Raymond G.P. McQuaid, J. Marty Gregg, Amit Kumar
Abstract: Conventionally, dc fields are used for switching dipole orientations in ferroelectrics. Such fields tilt the potential surface experienced by domain walls and thereby lower activation energies for their movement: escape from tilted potential wells is then realised by thermal excitation, allowing a "creep" process of pinning and depinning to develop. Borrowing ideas of domain wall resonance from the magnetic racetrack community, we show that ac fields, applied at the right frequency, can cause switching at much lower field magnitudes than dc ones (by factors of 4-5). Ferroelectric wall motion appears to be overdamped in the system studied (relaxor strontium barium niobate) and so the maximum in switching efficacy observed, at ~100 kHz, cannot be associated with resonant amplification, which needs an underdamped environment. Instead, in this high viscosity system, the frequency at which the maximum switching efficacy occurs seems to represent a compromise between the attempt frequency for wall depinning (which increases with frequency) and the extent to which energy is transferred to the wall within each field cycle (which decreases with frequency). Notwithstanding the absence of true resonance, the observation that ac excitation can dramatically reduce the bias levels needed for ferroelectric switching could still have significant ramifications for low energy memory technology.

Title: Effect of oxygen content on optical, structural, and dielectric properties of Al$_x$Ta$_y$O$_z$$ thin films
Authors: Pavel Ondračka, Richard Drevet, Daniel Franta, Jan Dvořák, Ivan Ohlídal, Petr Vašina
Abstract: This study reports on the optical, structural, and dielectric properties of aluminum tantalum oxide (Al$_x$Ta$_y$O$_z$) thin films deposited at low temperature on silicon and steel substrates by pulsed direct current reactive magnetron sputtering of a target containing 80 at.% aluminum and 20 at.% tantalum in Ar/O$_2$ atmosphere. Oxygen flow rates ranging from 5.0 to 20 sccm corresponded to O content changes from 57.7 to 69.6 at.% and resulted in large differences in dielectric behavior, from films with no measurable dielectric strength to a dielectric strength of 231 V$\mu$m$^{-1}$, respectively. Ab initio calculations were employed to explain the large property changes, and we show that a decrease in the dielectric strength can be linked to the formation of metal-metal bonds in the material, when the O content is less than what would correspond to a stoichiometric Ta$_2$O$_5$ and Al$_2$O$_3$ mixture. The electronic states corresponding to the metal--metal bonds are located in the band gap close to the top of the valence band, leading to an effective band gap reduction, which is directly supported by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy valence band measurements and by a broad optical absorption in the visible region.

Title: Orbital current signature using neutron diffraction
Authors: Dalila Bounoua, William Liège, Yvan Sidis, Philippe Bourges
Abstract: We review the hallmarks of orbital loop currents in various correlated electron materials and how they have been evidenced using polarized neutron diffraction. Over the last 20 years, loop current signatures have been observed in high temperature copper oxide superconductors, iridates, copper oxides spin ladders and recently kagome vanadate superconductors. Such currents induce orbital magnetic moments within the unit cell of these quantum materials that can be detected through their interaction with the neutron spin. In addition to the usual description of orbital moments using point-like local magnetic moments, we here show an alternative description of the neutron magnetic cross-section involving the microscopic currents running between different atomic orbitals. We discuss the corresponding magnetic structure factors and the resulting quantitative differences between both approaches.

Title: Unveiling Photoluminescence Signatures of Magneto-Optical Coupling in Layered Hybrid Manganese Chloride Perovskites

Abstract: Understanding the interplay between magnetic ordering and light emission is crucial for developing magneto-optical technologies. However, this phenomenon is poorly understood since observations of this coupling vary significantly across materials. In this context, hybrid organic-inorganic metal halide perovskites (HOIPs) that incorporate Mn2+ ions are a chemically and structurally tunable platform for exploring this phenomenon, since they exhibit magnetic ordering and photoluminescence (PL) emission. Here, we study two antiferromagnetic Mn-based HOIPs with different organic cations that result in distinct lattice stiffness, Mn2+-Mn2+ distance and octahedral distortion. Temperature-dependent PL excitation spectroscopy reveals changes in crystal field splitting energy and Racah parameters well above the Néel temperature (TN), indicating the emergence of Mn2+-Mn2+ magnetic interactions prior to reach long-range magnetic ordering. These variations align with the observed changes in temperature-PL evolution. The compound with a more rigid lattice shows stronger changes closer to TN, suggesting combined effects of magnetic polarons and spin-canting. In contrast, magnetic polaron-induced magnetic modifications prevail in the HOIP with a softer lattice. These results reveal the complexity of the magneto-optical coupling in Mn-based HOIPs and provide new insights into this field extensible to other 2D materials that exhibit this phenomenon with potential for advanced magneto-optical applications.

Title: Emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator near a moiré Kondo breakdown
Authors: Wanghao Tian, Bowen Shen, Lizhong Li, Mingjie Zhang, Feng Liu, Chushan Li, Yaotian Liu, Fan Xu, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Peiling Li, Li Lu, Yang Xu, Shengwei Jiang, Tingxin Li, Jie Shan, Kin Fai Mak
Abstract: Moiré semiconductors built on angle-aligned transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterobilayers provide a physical realization of the Kondo lattice model, in which one TMD layer is prepared in a Mott insulating state supporting a lattice of local magnetic moments and the other layer in a metallic state supporting itinerant carriers. The artificial Kondo lattice enables the exploration of exotic states of matter near a continuously tunable Kondo breakdown. Here we report the emergence of a symmetry-broken Chern insulator at a moiré hole filling factor 4/3 in angle-aligned MoTe2/WSe2 moiré bilayers, which realize a chiral Kondo lattice. The symmetry-broken Chern insulator, which exhibits integer quantized Hall conductance at a fractional moiré filling, breaks the translational symmetry of the lattice spontaneously; it also appears only near a magnetic field-induced Kondo breakdown in the mixed-valence regime of the material. We further demonstrate that the magnetic field required to induce the Kondo breakdown and to stabilize the symmetry-broken Chern insulator is twist angle dependent. The results present new opportunities for exploring the subtle interplay between topology and Kondo interactions in moiré semiconductors.

Title: Chiral phonons in sixfold chiral CrSi$_2$: Raman spectroscopy and first-principles calculations
Authors: Gakuto Kusuno, Shingo Kisanuki, Yusuke Kousaka, Yoshihiko Togawa, Takuya Satoh
Abstract: Chiral phonons have been identified in several chiral crystals, primarily in those with trigonal symmetry and threefold screw axes. In this study, chiral phonons in CrSi$_2$, a chiral crystal with a sixfold helical structure, were investigated. Circularly polarized Raman spectroscopy revealed a subtle splitting of doubly degenerate $E_2$ phonon modes between cross-circular polarization configurations. These observations, supported by first-principles phonon calculations, indicate the presence of chiral phonons in CrSi$_2$, expanding the scope of materials that exhibit chiral vibrational modes beyond the conventional trigonal class.

Title: Semiclassical theory for the orbital magnetic moment of superconducting quasiparticles
Authors: Jian-hua Zeng, Zhongbo Yan, Zhi Wang, Qian Niu
Abstract: We study the orbital magnetic moment of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors with the semiclassical approach. We derive the orbital magnetic moment of a quasiparticle wavepacket by considering the energy correction of the wavepacket to the linear order of the magnetic field. The semiclassical result is further verified by a linear response calculation with a full quantum mechanical method. From the analytical expression we find that nontrivial structure in the superconducting pairing gap alone is unable to produce quasiparticle orbital magnetic moment, which is in sharp contrast to the behavior of quasiparticle Berry curvatures. We apply the formula to study a tight-binding model with chiral $d$-wave superconducting gap, and show the influence of orbital magnetic moment on the energy spectrum and local density of states. We also calculate the orbital Nernst effect driven by the interplay between the orbital magnetic moment and the Berry curvature of Bogoliubov quasiparticles.

Title: Data-Driven Prediction of Dielectric Anisotropy in Nematic Liquid Crystals
Authors: Charles Parton-Barr, Richard J. Mandle
Abstract: We curate a large-scale dataset of low frequency dielectric anisotropy values for low molecular weight liquid crystals. Using this dataset, we demonstrate that supervised machine-learning models can predict dielectric anisotropy with substantially improved accuracy (RMSE 2.6) compared to estimates obtained from the Maier-Meier relations using molecular properties from both the widely used semiempirical AM1 method (RMSE 9.7) and the modern r2scan-3c composite method (RMSE 11.2). Realising the potential of machine learning techniques for liquid crystalline materials requires carefully curated data to be accessible, and on this basis we propose a simple and standard template for reporting data.

Title: Quantifying non-Markovianity in magnetization dynamics via entropy production rates
Authors: Felix Hartmann, Finja Tietjen, R. Matthias Geilhufe, Janet Anders
Abstract: Magnetization dynamics is commonly described by the stochastic Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation. On picosecond timescales, inertial and open-system extensions of the LLG equation are necessary to interpret recent experiments. We show analytically and numerically that the standard LLG equation exhibits strictly positive entropy production rates, while inertial and open-system LLG dynamics display temporarily negative entropy production rates indicating non-Markovianity. Here we quantify the degree of non-Markovianity using established measures. Our numerical calculations show that the open-system LLG equation consistently exhibits the highest magnitude of non-Markovianity for different initial conditions and magnetic field orientations.

Title: Atomic-Scale Surface Imaging of bulk Epitaxial CsPbBr3 Perovskite Single Crystals on Mica using Light Assisted Scanning Tunneling Microscopy at Low-Temperature (80 K)
Authors: Eric Duverger, Vladimir Bruevich, Vitaly Podzorov, Damien Riedel
Abstract: Epitaxial single-crystalline CsPbBr3 perovskite films on mica, prepared ex-situ, are explored using a low-temperature scanning tunneling microscope (STM) by probing the unoccupied electronic states of their surface in ultra-high vacuum (UHV) at 80 K. Light-assisted STM measurements under a broadband illumination with visible light were employed to enhance and stabilize surface conductivity. STM imaging across the surface of macroscopic bulk CsPbBr3 films reveals large flat terraces characterized by a specific type of surface reconstruction, consisting of parallel rows of U-shaped atomic nanostructures. These structures are spaced by 12 angstroms and exhibit an internal periodicity of 5.1 angstroms. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations reproduce the experimental observations and reveal a competition between different orthorhombic CsPbBr3(110) surface reconstructions: a Cs-rich structure, identified as the most energetically stable, and three alternative PbBr rich reconstructions, which are slightly higher in energy yet remain consistent with the STM data. Additional analyses that explicitly account for the mica substrate exclude the cubic CsPbBr3 phase and other orthorhombic surface orientations, while showing that variations in the mica surface termination do not alter the preferred CsPbBr3(110) reconstruction. This combined approach thereby confirms our assignment and resolves previous STM interpretations of CsPbBr3.

Title: A covariant fermionic path integral for scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise
Authors: Daniel G. Barci, Leticia F. Cugliandolo, Zochil González Arenas
Abstract: We revisit the construction of the fermionic path-integral representation of overdamped scalar Langevin processes with multiplicative white noise, focusing on the covariance of the generating functional under non-linear changes of variables. We identify the transformations of the auxiliary (commuting and anticommuting) variables that ensure covariance under such transformations. The subtleties induced by the non-differentiable trajectories of the stochastic dynamics are encoded in the fermionic statistics. Upon integrating out the auxiliary variables, we derive the Onsager-Machlup formulation, which agrees with the one recently obtained using a higher-order discretization scheme. In contrast to the latter, the construction proposed here is formulated directly in continuous time.

Title: Fractional $1/3$ quantum vortices in chiral $d+id$ kagome superconductors
Authors: Frederik A. S. Philipsen, Mats Barkman, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen
Abstract: We perform a theoretical investigation of the nature of vortices in chiral $d+id$ superconductors on the kagome lattice. The study is motivated by recent experimental developments reporting evidence of time-reversal symmetry breaking in the superconducting state of kagome metals. Using self-consistent microscopic calculations that incorporate the characteristics of the band structure of the kagome lattice, we find that fractional vortices permeate the ground state condensate in the presence of an external field. Each fractional vortex carries one third of the superconducting flux quantum and exhibits a characteristic signature related to one of the three sublattice degrees of freedom of the kagome lattice. We discuss the relevance of these results to recent experimental studies of kagome superconductors in the presence of an external magnetic field.

Title: Hartree shift and pairing gap in ultracold Fermi gases in the framework of low-momentum interactions
Authors: Michael Urban, S. Ramanan
Abstract: In this paper we consider a two-component gas of fermions on the BCS side of the BCS-BEC crossover at zero temperature. We use a momentum dependent interaction that reproduces the s-wave scattering phase shifts of a contact interaction up to a momentum cutoff that is scaled with the Fermi momentum. Using a diagrammatic formulation of Bogoliubov many-body perturbation theory, suitably augmented by self-consistency conditions, we obtain the Hartree shift and the pairing gap to third order. In the weak-coupling regime, our results are not only well-converged but also agree with the well-established Gor'kov-Melik-Barkhudarov corrections for the gap and the Galitskii result for the Hartree shift. Near the unitary regime, our results for the Nambu-Gor'kov self-energy are less converged, but there is still reasonable agreement with experiments as well as with quantum Monte-Carlo results. Perspectives for improvements and applications of this approach to neutron matter are discussed.

Title: Mott-insulating phases of the Bose-Hubbard model on quasi-1D ladder lattices
Authors: Lorenzo Carfora, Callum W. Duncan, Stefan Kuhr, Peter Kirton
Abstract: We calculate the phase diagram of the Bose-Hubbard model on a half-filled ladder lattice including the effect of finite on-site interactions. This shows that the rung-Mott insulator (RMI) phase persists to finite interaction strength, and we calculate the RMI-superfluid phase boundary in the thermodynamic limit. We show that the phases can still be distinguished using the number and parity variances, which are observables accessible in a quantum-gas microscope. Phases analogous to the RMI were found to exist in other quasi-1D lattice structures, with the lattice connectivity modifying the phase boundaries. This shows that the the presence of these phases is the result of states with one-dimensional structures being mapped onto higher dimensional systems, driven by the reduction of hopping rates along different directions.

Title: Matrix-product operator dualities in integrable lattice models
Authors: Yuan Miao, Andras Molnar, Nick G. Jones
Abstract: Matrix-product operators (MPOs) appear throughout the study of integrable lattice models, notably as the transfer matrices. They can also be used as transformations to construct dualities between such models, both invertible (including unitary) and non-invertible (including discrete gauging). We analyse how the local Yang--Baxter integrable structures are modified under such dualities. We see that the $\check{R}$-matrix, that appears in the baxterization approach to integrability, transforms in a simple manner. We further show for a broad class of MPOs that the usual Yang--Baxter $R$-matrix satisfies a modified algebra, previously identified in the unitary case, that gives a local integrable structure underlying the commuting transfer matrices of the dual model. We illustrate these results with two case studies, analysing an invertible unitary MPO and a non-invertible MPO both applied to the canonical XXZ spin chain. The former is the cluster entangler, arising in the study of symmetry-protected topological phases, while the latter is the Kramers--Wannier duality. We show several results for MPOs with exact MPO inverses that are of independent interest.

Title: Charge and energy transport in graphene with smooth finite-range disorder
Authors: Juan A. Cañas, Daniel A. Bonilla, J. C. Pérez-Pedraza, A. Martín-Ruiz
Abstract: We investigate charge and energy transport in monolayer graphene with smooth finite-range disorder, modeled by soft impurity potentials. Using a continuum Dirac model, we go beyond the Born approximation by computing the exact scattering matrix for individual impurities. This captures the full nonperturbative physics of smooth disorder. From the exact scattering data, we evaluate transport coefficients by solving the Boltzmann equation with energy-resolved phase shifts. We analyze electrical and electronic thermal conductivities versus carrier density and temperature, including deviations from the Wiedemann-Franz law. Our results reveal that finite-range disorder nontrivially modifies charge and heat currents, especially at low energies where perturbative methods fail. These findings provide a more accurate transport characterization for disordered Dirac materials and clarify how smooth disorder governs energy flow in graphene.

Abstract: Lithium (Li) plating on graphite is a significant degradation mechanism in Li-ion batteries. While numerous experimental techniques have been used to study Li plating in laboratory cells, investigations of commercial high-energy cells often rely on electrochemical methods. Here we present and classify various methods for detecting Li plating on a commercial A123 pouch cell. In a round robin study across multiple battery research laboratories, Li-plated graphitic electrode material was analyzed using electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic methods capable of detecting metallic Li deposits. After cell opening, their overall distribution on the anode surface was examined using a flatbed scanner to ensure comparability of the samples. Optical and electron microscopy provided detailed surface and, in combination with a focused ion beam, subsurface structure and morphology. Spectroscopic methods confirmed the presence and onset of plated Li with varying sensitivity. Moreover, spectroscopic and imaging techniques were combined correlatively where possible. Availability and measurement duration of each technique was compared. Optical methods are fast and easy to use; thus, they are recommended for most samples, with spectroscopic confirmation reserved for reference samples. This multimodal study demonstrates a range of methods that can be used alone or in combination to qualitatively or quantitatively detect Li-plating.

Title: Prediction of room-temperature two-dimensional $π$-electron half-metallic ferrimagnets
Authors: J. Phillips, J. C. G. Henriques, J. Fernández-Rossier, A. T. Costa
Abstract: We propose a strategy to obtain conducting organic materials with fully spin-polarized Fermi surface, lying at a singular flat band, with antiferromagnetically coupled magnetic moments that reside in pi-orbitals of nanographenes. We consider a honeycomb crystal whose unit cell combines two different molecules with S=1/2: an Aza-3-Triangulene, a molecule with orbital degeneracy, and a 2-Triangulene. The analyzed system is half-metallic with a ferrimagnetic order, presenting a zero net total magnetic moment per unit cell. We combine density functional theory calculations with a Hubbard model Hamiltonian to compute the magnetic interactions, the bands, the intrinsic Anomalous Hall effect, and the collective spin excitations. We obtain very large intermolecular exchange couplings, in the range of 50 meV, which ensures room temperature stability. When the magnetization is off-plane, intrinsic spin orbit coupling in graphene opens up a topological gap that, despite being very small, leads to a quantized Hall conductance in the tens of mK range. Above 1 Kelvin, the system will behave like a half-metal with fully compensated magnetic moments, thereby combining two characteristics that make it ideal for spintronics applications.

Abstract: Brownian motion provides access to hydrodynamic properties of nanoscale objects independent of their optical resolvability. Here, we present a diffusion-based approach to infer effective particle size distributions of DNA-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles (MNPs), consisting of a magnetic core and a polystyrene shell, in a regime where direct geometric sizing is limited by optical diffraction. Using multi-particle tracking microscopy, we analyze the Brownian dynamics of MNPs grafted with double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) of varying contour length under low-salt conditions. A physically motivated model is introduced that relates dsDNA contour length to an effective hydrodynamic diameter via an attenuated corona description. The measured diffusion coefficient distributions exhibit a systematic and monotonic dependence on dsDNA length in quantitative agreement with the model. While the tracked objects are predominantly dsDNA-mediated agglomerates rather than isolated nanoparticles, clustering does not obscure the length-dependent signal. Instead, the dsDNA corona determines the hydrodynamic scaling, whereas agglomeration mainly introduces an offset and distribution broadening. These results demonstrate that Brownian dynamics enables robust readout of biomolecular length scales even far below the optical resolution limit. The distribution-based approach is inherently tolerant to polydispersity and aggregation, making diffusion-based tracking a simple and promising strategy for future biotechnological and biomedical assays.

Title: Perturbative sensing of nanoscale materials with millimeter-wave photonic crystals

Abstract: We introduce millimeter-wave silicon photonic crystal cavities as a versatile platform for the perturbative sensing of nanoscale materials. This dielectric-based platform is compatible with strong magnetic fields, opening avenues for studying quantum materials in extreme environments where superconducting cavities cannot operate. To establish the platform's performance, we cryogenically characterize a silicon photonic crystal cavity at 4.3 K, achieving a total quality factor exceeding $10^5$ for a 96 GHz mode. As a proof-of-concept for its sensing capabilities, we position a hexagonal boron nitride-multilayer graphene (hBN-MLG) heterostructure at an electric-field antinode of the cavity and measure the perturbative response at room temperature. The heterostructure induces a significant change in the cavity's resonance, from which we extract a total sample conductivity of approximately $5.1\times10^6$~S/m. These results establish silicon photonic crystal cavities as a promising platform for sensitive, on-chip spectroscopy of nanoscale materials at millimeter-wave frequencies.

Title: Interpretable Machine Learning of Nanoparticle Stability through Topological Layer Embeddings
Authors: Felipe Hawthorne, Leandro Seixas, James M. Almeida, Cristiano F. Woellner, Raphael M. Tromer
Abstract: The stability of chemically complex nanoparticles is governed by an immense configurational space arising from heterogeneous local atomic environments across surface and interior regions. Efficiently identifying low-energy configurations within this space remains a central challenge for first-principles-based materials discovery, particularly when the available reference data are limited. Here, we introduce a data-efficient and physically interpretable machine-learning framework based on a fragmented, layer-resolved descriptor that explicitly decomposes nanoparticles into surface, intermediate, and core environments using a topology-driven definition. This representation preserves a compact and fixed feature dimensionality while retaining spatial resolution, enabling controlled emphasis on different regions of the nanoparticle through physically motivated weighting schemes. Coupled with gradient-boosted decision tree models and a ranking-based learning strategy, the proposed framework enables accurate identification of the most stable nanoparticle configurations using only a few hundred density functional theory reference calculations. Ranking performance metrics demonstrate near-saturation of correlation, high top-k recall, and rapidly vanishing regret at moderate training-set sizes, highlighting the strong data efficiency of the approach. Beyond predictive performance, layer-weighting and SHAP-based interpretability analyses reveal how surface segregation, coordination topology, and local chemical disorder contribute differently to stability across spatial regions of the nanoparticle. These insights provide a transparent physical interpretation of the learned models and establish a natural pathway toward active learning-driven exploration of complex nanoparticle configurational spaces.

Title: Densely-packed particle raft at vertically vibrated air-water interface
Authors: Xiuhe Yan, Tabitha C. Watson, Hongyi Xiao
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a dense raft of millimeter-sized granular particles at a vertically vibrated air-water interface, which displays a rich set of patterns and particle dynamics as we vary the vibration amplitude, frequency, and particle packing fraction. While the classical parametric instability with standing waves still occurs over a certain parameter space, the measured wave dispersion relations indicate an increasing role in the raft's emerging elasticity at higher packing fractions, which induces a decrease in the effective surface tension and an increase in an out-of-plane bending modulus. At higher vibration frequencies and lower amplitudes, we also identified a regime without standing waves in which individual particles exhibit thermal-like motion and transition from diffusive to sub-diffusive transport as the packing fraction increases. Glassy behaviors such as spatial and temporal heterogeneity in particle dynamics occur as well, which is analogous to supercooled liquids. When the vibration amplitude is increased starting in this supercooled regime, a large cavity eventually forms inside the raft with its size and shape related to the vibration frequency and the injected vibration energy. The cavitation results in the coexistence of free surface water waves inside the cavity and thermal-like particle motion in the raft.

Title: Light-Activated Self-thermophoretic Janus Nanopropellers
Authors: Henri Truong, Chiara Moretti, Lionel Buisson, Benjamin Abecassis, Eric Grelet
Abstract: Achieving controlled and directed motion of artificial nanoscale systems in three-dimensional fluid environments remains a key-challenge in active matter, primarily due to the prevailing thermal fluctuations that rapidly randomize the particle trajectories. While significant progress has been made with micrometer-sized particles, imparting sufficient mechanical energy, or self-propulsion, to nanometer-sized particles to overcome Brownian diffusion and enable controlled transport remains a major issue for emerging applications in nanoscience and nanomedicine. Here, we address this challenge by demonstrating the fuel-free, reversible, and tunable active behavior of gold-silica (Au-SiO2) Janus nanoparticles (radius R=33 nm) induced by optical excitation. Using single particle tracking, we provide direct experimental evidence of self-thermophoresis, clearly distinguishing active motion from thermal noise. These light-driven Janus nanoparticles constitute a minimal yet robust photothermal system for investigating active matter and its manipulation at the nanoscale.

Title: Dual-purpose architected materials: Optimizing graded BCC lattices for crashworthiness and heat dissipation
Authors: Jaswanth V Gurudev, Ratna Kumar Annabattula
Abstract: Body-centered Cubic (BCC) lattice structures demonstrate promising performance for applications that require simultaneous mechanical energy absorption and thermal management. However, current optimization approaches are typically confined to single-domain objectives, such as mechanical parameters like impact energy and peak stress, neglecting the role of multiple physics in real-world performance. To address this, we propose a multi-objective optimization framework for density-graded BCC lattices that effectively dissipates heat while maximizing absorbed impact energy. A parametric three-zone lattice configuration is investigated to explore various trade-offs between mechanical and thermal properties. Each design is evaluated through independent impact and forced-convection simulations using commercial solvers. Specific Energy Absorption (SEA) and peak stresses at the distal end quantify impact absorption performance, while the Nusselt number and pressure drop characterize thermal dissipation performance. Surrogate models constructed from this data enable multi-objective optimization via Goal Programming to identify an optimal design. Two Pareto-optimal lattice designs are identified with reduced pressure drop and peak stress, underlining the superiority of strategic density gradation. Analysis of the optimal designs reveals how material distribution and geometric design variables influence mechanical-thermal trade-offs, establishing quantitative design guidelines for lattice structures in this multi-physics application.

Title: Hybrid Monte Carlo for Fractional Quantum Hall States
Authors: Ting-Tung Wang, Ha Quang Trung, Qianhui Xu, Min Long, Bo Yang, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: We develop a hybrid Monte Carlo method to efficiently compute the physical observables from the samplings of the Laughlin and the Moore-Read wave functions of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) systems. With the advancements in methodology, including global updates and double stereographic projection on spherical geometry, our hybrid Monte Carlo simulation is significantly faster than the widely used Metropolis Monte Carlo scheme. As a result, we can readily simulate systems with electron numbers $N > 1000$ on both disk and sphere geometries. We apply this method to investigating the topological shift obtained from the edge dipole moment, computed from the density of the wave function on the disk. We also numerically computed the non-Abelian braiding matrices for different braiding schemes of the Moore-Read quasiholes on the sphere. Results with much better quality compared with previous works have been achieved. With the thermodynamic limit results obtained at ease, we also discuss the future usage of our method to clarify the questions on the instability of fractional quantum Hall states in an ideal Chern band setting or under quantum decoherence.

Title: The influence of Y content on grain structure evolution in Mg-Y alloys
Authors: Qianying Shi, Vaidehi Menon, Liang Qi, John Allison
Abstract: To advance the understanding of microstructural evolution behavior in Mg-rare earth alloys, the effect of yttrium (Y) addition on static recrystallization and grain growth in Mg alloys was systematically investigated in extruded Mg-1wt.%Y and Mg-7wt.%Y alloys. Y addition was found to significantly retard the microstructural evolution, primarily due to its solute drag effect arising from Y segregation at grain boundaries. The relative intensity of solute drag effects from different alloying elements in Mg alloys was further assessed from both thermodynamic and kinetic perspectives, considering their grain boundary segregation tendencies and diffusivities. Additionally, static recrystallization in Mg-Y alloys was observed to proceed via a two-stage behavior characterized with two distinct JMAK exponents, indicating the heterogeneous nucleation of recrystallized grains. Abnormal grain growth (AGG) behavior was observed in these Mg-Y alloys. Overall, this study highlights the critical role of Y segregation at grain boundaries in controlling recrystallization and grain growth kinetics in Mg-Y alloys. This provides new insights into the design of thermally stable Mg alloys with refined microstructures.

Title: Discovery of Polymer Electrolytes with Bayesian Optimization and High-Throughput Molecular Dynamics simulations
Authors: Antonia S. Kuhn, Jurğis Ruža, KyuJung Jun, Pablo Leon, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Polymer electrolytes are critical for safe, high-energy-density solid-state batteries, yet discovering candidates that balance high ionic conductivity with high transference numbers remains a significant challenge. In this work, we develop a high-throughput screening platform that utilizes molecular dynamics simulations to navigate a chemical space of 1.7 million hypothetical polymer electrolyte candidates. Data from previous literature is used to warm-start batch Bayesian optimization for iteratively selecting new polymer electrolytes to evaluate. We iteratively identified, evaluated and analyzed 767 homopolymers as potential candidates. Our results reveal several candidates with transport properties exceeding the benchmark polyethylene oxide (PEO)/LiTFSI system. Crucially, our optimization campaigns for ionic conductivity and Li-diffusivity demonstrate that branched architectures and ketone functional groups significantly enhance ion-hopping mechanisms within the polymer matrix. We provide an in-depth mechanistic comparison of Li vs. Na cation transport and offer our open-source framework to accelerate the discovery of liquid, gel, and multi-cation electrolyte systems.

Title: Measuring spectral functions of doped magnets with Rydberg tweezer arrays
Authors: Romain Martin, Mu Qiao, Ivan Morera, Lukas Homeier, Bastien Gély, Lukas Klein, Yuki Torii Chew, Daniel Barredo, Thierry Lahaye, Eugene Demler, Antoine Browaeys
Abstract: Spectroscopic measurements of single-particle spectral functions provide crucial insight into strongly correlated quantum matter by resolving the energy and spatial structure of elementary excitations. Here we introduce a spectroscopic protocol for single-charge injection with simultaneous spatial and energy resolution in a Rydberg tweezer array, effectively emulating scanning tunneling microscopy. By combining this protocol with single-atom-resolved imaging, we go beyond conventional spectroscopy by not only measuring the single-particle spectral function but also directly imaging the microscopic structure of the excitations underlying spectral resonances in frustrated $tJ$ Hamiltonians. We reveal resonances associated with the formation of bound magnetic polarons -- composite quasiparticles consisting of a mobile hole bound to a magnon -- and directly extract their binding energy, spatial extent, and spin character. Finally, by exploiting the spatial tunability of our platform, we measure the local density of states across different lattice geometries. Our work establishes Rydberg tweezer arrays as a powerful platform for spectroscopic studies of strongly correlated models, offering microscopic control and direct real-space access to emergent quasiparticles in engineered quantum matter.

Title: First-principles Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian Construction for Chemisorbed Hydrogen at Metal Surfaces
Authors: Nils Hertl, Zsuszanna Koczor-Benda, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: The Newns-Anderson Hamiltonian is widely used to describe adsorption at gas-solid interfaces, yet its construction typically relies on simplifying assumptions such as constant coupling and the wideband limit approximation. Here, we present a first-principles approach to construct Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians by applying projection operator diabatisation to Hamiltonian matrices obtained from Kohn-Sham density functional theory calculations. We demonstrate this method for chemisorbed hydrogen on three fcc metal(111) surfaces: Al, Cu, and Pt. To validate the electronic coupling between adsorbed hydrogen and the metal surface, we compute the projected density of states, electronic tunnelling lifetimes, and vibrational lifetimes from the constructed Newns-Anderson Hamiltonians and find good agreement with reference calculations. Analysis of the chemisorption function reveals that the wideband limit approximation is valid for H/Al(111) but has limited applicability for H/Cu(111) and H/Pt(111).

Title: Planckian bound on the local equilibration time
Authors: Marvin Qi, Alexey Milekhin, Luca Delacrétaz
Abstract: The local equilibration time $\tau_{\rm eq}$ of quantum many-body systems is conjectured to be bounded below by the Planckian time $\hbar /T$. We formalize this conjecture by defining $\tau_{\rm eq}$ as the time scale at which a hydrodynamic description emerges for conserved densities. Drawing on analytic properties of real time thermal correlators, we establish a rigorous lower bound $\tau_{\rm eq} \geq \alpha \hbar /T$ on the onset of hydrodynamic behavior in a `regulated' thermal two-point function. The dimensionless coefficient $\alpha $ depends only on dimensionality and the type of hydrodynamic or diffusive behavior that emerges, and is independent of the thermalization mechanism or other microscopic details. This bound applies universally to local quantum many-body systems, with or without a quasiparticle description, including in the presence of inelastic scattering.

Title: Exotic critical states as fractional Fermi seas in the one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Alvise Bastianello, Yi Zeng, Sudipta Dhar, Zekui Wang, Xudong Yu, Milena Horvath, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Yanliang Guo, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Manuele Landini
Abstract: Critical quantum field theories occupy a central position in modern theoretical physics for their inherent universality stemming from long-range correlations. As an example, the Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid (TLL) describes a wealth of one-dimensional quantum systems at low temperatures. Its behavior is deeply rooted in the emergence of an effective Fermi sea, leading to power-law correlations and Friedel oscillations. A promising direction to realize systems exhibiting novel universal behavior beyond TLL is through the generalization of the underlying Fermi sea. In this Letter, we show that fractional Fermi seas with reduced occupancy arise in an integrable Bose gas driven out of equilibrium by cyclic changes in interactions from repulsive to attractive. The correlation functions feature signatures of criticality incompatible with a conventional TLL, suggesting a novel critical phase. Our predictions, based on Generalized Hydrodynamics, are directly relevant to cold atoms.

Title: Realization of fractional Fermi seas
Authors: Yi Zeng, Alvise Bastianello, Sudipta Dhar, Zekui Wang, Xudong Yu, Milena Horvath, Grigori E. Astrakharchik, Yanliang Guo, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl, Manuele Landini
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle is a cornerstone of quantum physics: it governs the structure of matter. Extensions of this principle, such as Haldane's generalized exclusion statistics, predict the existence of exotic quantum states characterized by fractional Fermi seas (FFS), i.e. momentum distributions with uniform but fractional occupancies. Here, we report the experimental realization of fractional Fermi seas in an excited one-dimensional Bose gas prepared through ramping cycles in the interaction strength. The resulting excited yet stable Bose-gas states exhibit Friedel oscillations, smoking-gun signatures of the underlying FFS. The stabilization of these states offers an opportunity to deepen our understanding of quantum thermodynamics in the presence of exotic statistics and paves the way for applications in quantum information and sensing.

Title: Anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid for Coulomb interacting generalized Weyl fermions
Authors: Gabriel Malavé, Rodrigo Soto-Garrido, Bitan Roy, Vladimir Juričić
Abstract: Owing to the power-law anisotropy in the quasiparticle dispersion, yielding an enhanced density of states, the effects of long range Coulomb interaction get amplified in three-dimensional generalized Weyl semimetals, characterized by integer monopole charge $n>1$ of the underlying Weyl nodes. Using a Wilsonian renormalization group approach controlled by a large-$N$ expansion with $N$ as the number of Weyl fermion flavors and a gauge-consistent regularization fixed by the Ward-Takahashi identity, we uncover for $n\ge 2$ an extended interaction-dominated scaling regime with intrinsically anisotropic dynamic Coulomb screening, a finite fermionic anomalous dimension, and a power-law suppression of the quasiparticle residue, yielding an \emph{anisotropic} marginal non-Fermi liquid at intermediate energies. Ultimately, the effective fine structure constant flows to zero, albeit only logarithmically slowly, so the marginal Fermi liquid phenomenology emerges as a broad crossover, controlled by a slowly running coupling. By contrast, for $n=1$ the system retains an isotropic marginal Weyl-liquid character. These predictions can be tested via scaling in thermodynamics (specific heat and compressibility), direction-dependent optical conductivity, and by anisotropic broadening of the single-particle spectral function in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy.

Title: Operational measurement of relativistic equilibrium from stochastic fields alone
Authors: Ira Wolfson
Abstract: Relativistic equilibrium is described by the inverse-temperature four-vector $\beta^\mu = u^\mu/(k_B T_0)$ rather than by a frame-dependent scalar temperature. We show that $\beta^\mu$ can be reconstructed directly from electromagnetic fluctuations emitted by a drifting medium, without external probes, spectral lines, or absolute intensity calibration. A Lorentz boost converts isotropic rest-frame noise into correlated electric and magnetic fields, producing a gain-independent fluctuation observable that yields the drift velocity purely from stochastic data. Combined with angle-resolved noise spectra governed by the covariant fluctuation--dissipation theorem, this enables full reconstruction of $\beta^\mu$ using electromagnetic measurements alone. Monte Carlo analysis demonstrates percent-level accuracy at realistic signal-to-noise ratios, and feasibility estimates indicate sub-microsecond integration times for laboratory plasmas. To our knowledge, this constitutes the first method that reconstructs the covariant thermal state $\beta^\mu$ of a relativistic medium from passive stochastic fields alone, without absolute calibration, spectral lines, or external probes. These results establish vacuum electromagnetic fluctuations as a direct operational probe of relativistic equilibrium.

Title: From Multipartite Entanglement to TQFT
Authors: Michele Del Zotto, Abhijit Gadde, Pavel Putrov
Abstract: At long distances, a gapped phase of matter is described by a topological quantum field theory (TQFT). We conjecture a tight and concrete relationship between the genuine $(d+1)$-partite entanglement -- labelled by a $d$-dimensional manifold $M$ -- in the ground state of a $(d-1)+1$-dimensional gapped theory and the partition function of the low energy TQFT on $M$. In particular, the conjecture implies that for $d=3$, the ground state wavefunction can determine the modular tensor category description of the low energy TQFT. We verify our conjecture for general (2+1)-dimensional Levin-Wen string-net models.

Title: Finite-Temperature Dynamical Phase Diagram of the $2+1$D Quantum Ising Model
Authors: Lucas Katschke, Roland C. Farrell, Umberto Borla, Lode Pollet, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Mapping finite-temperature dynamical phase diagrams of quantum many-body models is a necessary step towards establishing a framework of far-from-equilibrium quantum many-body universality. However, this is quite difficult due, in part, to the severe challenges in representing the volume-law entanglement that is generated under nonequilibrium dynamics at finite temperatures. Here, we address these challenges with an efficient equilibrium quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) framework for computing the finite-temperature dynamical phase diagram. Our method uses energy conservation and the self-thermalizing properties of ergodic quantum systems to determine observables at late times after a quantum quench. We use this technique to chart the dynamical phase diagram of the $2+1$D quantum Ising model generated by quenches of the transverse field in initial thermal states. Our approach allows us to track the evolution of dynamical phases as a function of both the initial temperature and transverse field. Surprisingly, we identify quenches in the ordered phase that cool the system as well as an interval of initial temperatures where it is possible to quench from the paramagnetic (PM) to ferromagnetic (FM) phases. Our method gives access to dynamical properties without explicitly simulating unitary time evolution, and is immediately applicable to other lattice geometries and interacting many-body systems. Finally, we propose a quantum simulation experiment on state-of-the-art digital quantum hardware to directly probe the predicted dynamical phases and their real-time formation.

Title: Entropic Barriers and the Kinetic Suppression of Topological Defects
Authors: Yi-Lin Tsao, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Many quantum phases, from topological orders to superfluids, are destabilized at finite temperature by the proliferation and motion of topological defects such as anyons or vortices. Conventional protection mechanisms rely on energetic gaps and fail once thermal fluctuations exceed the gap scale. Here we examine a complementary mechanism of entropic protection, in which defect nucleation is suppressed by coupling to mesoscopic auxiliary reservoirs of dimension $M$, generating an effective free-energy barrier that increases with temperature. In the Ising chain, this produces a characteristic three-regime evolution of the correlation length as a function of temperature - linear growth, entropy-controlled plateau, and eventual breakdown - indicating a general modification of defect behavior. Focusing on two spatial dimensions, where true finite-temperature topological order is forbidden in the thermodynamic limit, we show that entropic protection can nevertheless strongly enhance stabilization at finite system size, the regime directly relevant for quantum memory and experiments. Owing to the topological character of the defects, creation and transport are independently suppressed, yielding a double parametric reduction of logical errors in the entropic toric code and enhanced coherence when the framework is extended to Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transitions. Entropic barriers thus provide a passive and scalable route to stabilizing quantum phases in experimentally relevant regimes. We propose an experimental setup for entropic toric code using dual species Rydberg arrays with dressing.

Title: Controlling energy spectra and skin effect via boundary conditions in non-Hermitian lattices
Authors: S Rahul, Pasquale Marra
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems exhibit unique spectral properties, including the non-Hermitian skin effect and exceptional points, often influenced by boundary conditions. The modulation of these phenomena by generalized boundary conditions remains unexplored and not understood. Here, we analyze the Hatano-Nelson model with generalized boundary conditions induced by complex hopping amplitudes at the boundary. Using similarity transformations, we determine the conditions yielding real energy spectra and skin effect, and identify the emergence of exceptional points where spectra transition from real to complex. We demonstrate that tuning the boundary hopping amplitudes precisely controls the non-Hermitian skin effect, i.e., the localization of eigenmodes at the lattice edges. These findings reveal the sensitivity of spectral and localization properties to boundary conditions, providing a framework for engineering quantum lattice models with tailored spectral and localization features, with potential applications in quantum devices.

Title: Spectral Spacetime Entropy for Quasifree Theories
Authors: Joshua Y. L. Jones, Yasaman K. Yazdi
Abstract: Motivated by the necessity to UV-regularise entanglement entropy, we present a spectral method for calculating the entropy of quasifree states, for both bosonic and fermionic field theories. This construction is defined in spacetime rather than on a hypersurface, enabling the covariant regularisation of entropies, and its calculation in generic spacetime regions. We derive these formulae, which have previously appeared in the literature, in a new manner and highlight certain aspects of them, such as their connection to the density matrix and its eigenvalues. The spacetime nature of the formulation makes it particularly apt in the context of semiclassical and quantum gravity and in connection to black hole entropy. Another useful property of the formulation is its application to settings where no notion of a Cauchy surface exists, such as in the causal set theory approach to quantum gravity. We show example applications of the formulae which demonstrate their ability to reproduce known results. We also show a calculation in a causal set in $1+1$ dimensions which makes use of several of the unique and useful features of the formalism. In this last example, we obtain a novel result of a slightly modified entanglement entropy scaling coefficient, giving a possible signature of spacetime discreteness.

Title: Dissipation as a Resource: Synchronization, Coherence Recovery, and Chaos Control
Authors: Debabrata Mondal, Lea F. Santos, S. Sinha
Abstract: Dissipation is commonly regarded as an obstacle to quantum control, as it induces decoherence and irreversibility. Here we demonstrate that dissipation can instead be exploited as a resource to reshape the dynamics of interacting quantum systems. Using an experimentally realizable Bose-Josephson junction containing two bosonic species, we demonstrate that dissipation enables distinct dynamical behaviors: synchronized phase-locked oscillations, transient chaos with long-time coherence recovery, and steady-state chaos. The emergence of each behavior is determined by experimentally tunable parameters. At weak interactions, the two components synchronize despite dissipation, exhibiting long-lived coherent oscillations reminiscent of a boundary time crystal. Stronger interactions induce a dissipative phase transition into a self-trapped regime accompanied by chaotic dynamics. Remarkably, dissipation regulates the lifetime of chaos and enables the recovery of coherence at long times. By introducing a controlled tilt between the wells, transient chaos can be converted into persistent steady-state chaos. We further show that standard spectral diagnostics fail to distinguish between the two chaotic regimes, revealing that spectral statistics primarily reflect short-time instability. These results establish dissipation as a powerful tool for engineering dynamical phases, restoring quantum coherence, and controlling the duration of chaotic behavior and information scrambling.

Title: Supersymmetry and Nonreciprocity
Authors: Savdeep Sethi, Gabriel Artur Weiderpass
Abstract: Nonreciprocal theories are used to model a broad array of non-equilibrium phenomena found in nature ranging from biological systems like networks of neurons to the behavior of overflowing water fountains. This includes systems broadly classified as active matter systems. We show that the stochastic theories which describe nonreciprocal interactions can be mapped into quantum field theories described by a supersymmetric action with a single supercharge. The theories are generically non-Hermitian. This generalizes the past work of Parisi and Sourlas on reciprocal theories, which model systems with interactions derived from potentials.

Title: Complete closed-form solutions to the problem of inextensional bending for surfaces of translation and origami tessellations
Authors: Adam Reddy, Asma Karami, Hussein Nassar
Abstract: Plates generally admit six deformation modes: three of which are high in strain energy, stretch the plate's midsurface and are called membrane modes; and three are low-energy, bend the midsurface without stretching it and are called bending modes. For origami tessellations, and other corrugated compliant thin shells, the modes are mixed and it is no longer clear what modes, if any, are low in energy in the sense that they are inextensional. Here, it is shown, by direct construction of closed-form solutions, that when the midsurface is a surface of translation, there exists three infinitesimally inextensional deformation modes that correspond to (1) stretching, with an effective Poisson's effect; (2) bending, with an effective synclastic or anti-clastic effect; and to (3) twisting. The provided expressions are valid irrespective of surface regularity and, in particular, properly handle any creases be them straight or curved. The results provide a powerful benchmark for the validation of numerical methods and further insight into the elastic stiffness of thin corrugated compliant shells.

Title: Machine Learning Hamiltonians are Accurate Energy-Force Predictors
Authors: Seongsu Kim, Chanhui Lee, Yoonho Kim, Seongjun Yun, Honghui Kim, Nayoung Kim, Changyoung Park, Sehui Han, Sungbin Lim, Sungsoo Ahn
Abstract: Recently, machine learning Hamiltonian (MLH) models have gained traction as fast approximations of electronic structures such as orbitals and electron densities, while also enabling direct evaluation of energies and forces from their predictions. However, despite their physical grounding, existing Hamiltonian models are evaluated mainly by reconstruction metrics, leaving it unclear how well they perform as energy-force predictors. We address this gap with a benchmark that computes energies and forces directly from predicted Hamiltonians. Within this framework, we propose QHFlow2, a state-of-the-art Hamiltonian model with an SO(2)-equivariant backbone and a two-stage edge update. QHFlow2 achieves $40\%$ lower Hamiltonian error than the previous best model with fewer parameters. Under direct evaluation on MD17/rMD17, it is the first Hamiltonian model to reach NequIP-level force accuracy while achieving up to $20\times$ lower energy MAE. On QH9, QHFlow2 reduces energy error by up to $20\times$ compared to MACE. Finally, we demonstrate that QHFlow2 exhibits consistent scaling behavior with respect to model capacity and data, and that improvements in Hamiltonian accuracy effectively translate into more accurate energy and force computations.

Title: Overdamped limits for Langevin dynamics with position-dependent coefficients via $L^2$-hypocoercivity
Authors: Noé Blassel
Abstract: This note provides a simple derivation of the overdamped approximation for kinetic (or underdamped) equilibrium Langevin dynamics, in cases where certain coefficients depend on the position variable. The equivalent small-mass limit of these dynamics, known as the Kramers--Smoluchowski approximation, in the case of a state-dependent friction coefficient, has been previously studied by a variety of approaches. Our new approach uses hypocoercivity estimates, which may be of interest in their own right, and lead to a very direct derivation, providing in particular a clear explanation of the ``noise-induced drift'' term in the overdamped equation in the case of a state-dependent friction term. Using the same approach, we also treat several effective kinetic dynamical models derived from a coarse-graining approximation of a high-dimensional system, as well as a class of kinetic dynamics with position-dependent mass matrices. All of these models are relevant to applications in computational chemistry. We finally identify a mistake in a related work and suggest a solution.

Title: Once-excited random walks on general trees
Authors: Duy-Bao Le, Tuan-Minh Nguyen
Abstract: We study once-excited random walks on general trees, modeled by placing a single "cookie" at each vertex. Each cookie acts as a metaphorical reward that is consumed upon the first visit to the vertex where the cookie is placed. On that initial visit, the walk is in an excited state and behaves like a biased random walk. Once the cookie is consumed, the process reverts to a symmetric random walk on all subsequent visits. We consider a random environment in which the bias parameters are independent random variables. We prove that the process exhibits a sharp phase transition between transience and recurrence on general trees with polynomial growth, where the critical threshold is determined by the branching-ruin number of the tree.

Title: Graphs are maximally expressive for higher-order interactions
Authors: Tiago P. Peixoto, Leto Peel, Thilo Gross, Manlio De Domenico
Abstract: We demonstrate that graph-based models are fully capable of representing higher-order interactions, and have a long history of being used for precisely this purpose. This stands in contrast to a common claim in the recent literature on "higher-order networks" that graph-based representations are fundamentally limited to "pairwise" interactions, requiring hypergraph formulations to capture richer dependencies. We clarify this issue by emphasizing two frequently overlooked facts. First, graph-based models are not restricted to pairwise interactions, as they naturally accommodate interactions that depend simultaneously on multiple adjacent nodes. Second, hypergraph formulations are strict special cases of more general graph-based representations, as they impose additional constraints on the allowable interactions between adjacent elements rather than expanding the space of possibilities. We show that key phenomenology commonly attributed to hypergraphs -- such as abrupt transitions -- can, in general, be recovered exactly using graph models, even locally tree-like ones, and thus do not constitute a class of phenomena that is inherently contingent on hypergraphs models. Finally, we argue that the broad relevance of hypergraphs for applications that is sometimes claimed in the literature is not supported by evidence. Instead it is likely grounded in misconceptions that network models cannot accommodate multibody interactions or that certain phenomena can only be captured with hypergraphs. We argue that clearly distinguishing between multivariate interactions, parametrized by graphs, and the functions that define them enables a more unified and flexible foundation for modeling interacting systems.

Abstract: Photoluminescence intensity is widely used to infer exciton populations, yet the detected signal inherently convolves occupancy with radiative-rate modification and collection efficiency, making quantitative inversion vulnerable to pump and system drifts. Here we realize a dual-channel self-referenced scheme enabled by two nearly degenerate quasinormal modes in a hybrid microcavity. Their shared optical path provides common-mode observables (i.e., overall spectral and intensity drift) that track global thermo-optic and pump fluctuations, while their differential-mode observables (i.e., spectral splitting and mode-contrasted emission) remain highly sensitive to local gap dielectric perturbations and dipole-dependent radiative weights. Using temperature as a control parameter in monolayer WSe$ _2 $, we exploit this common/differential-mode framework to robustly invert the relative populations of excitons with out-of-plane ($ \perp $) and in-plane ($ \parallel $) dipole transitions without external absolute calibration. At the temperature of $\sim$50 K, we obtain $ N_\perp/N_\parallel \approx 200 $, coincident with the expected accumulation in the out-of-plane-emitting dark manifold. This internally referenced approach provides a practical route to drift-tolerant, dipole-resolved population metrology in nanogap photonic systems.

Title: Mesoscopic Spin Coherence in a Disordered Dark Electron Spin Ensemble
Authors: Taewoong Yoon, Sangwon Oh, Junghyun Lee, Hyunyong Choi
Abstract: Harnessing dipolar spin environments as controllable quantum resources is a central challenge in solid-state quantum technologies. Here, we report the observation of a coherent mesoscopic spin state in a disordered ensemble of substitutional nitrogen (P1) centers in diamond. An iterative Hartmann-Hahn protocol transfers polarization from dense nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers to a P1 ensemble, yielding a 740-fold enhancement over room-temperature thermal equilibrium as revealed by differential readout. The resulting mesoscopic P1 spin ensemble exhibits collective Rabi oscillations and long-lived spin-lock and Hahn-echo coherences. We identify a crossover in the saturation polarization arising from the competition between coherent driving and local disorder, providing a quantitative measure of the system's intrinsic disorder. These results establish a foundation for utilizing dark electron spin ensembles as robust resources for quantum sensing and quantum many-body simulation.

Title: Towards the complete description of stationary states of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional quasiperiodic lattice: A coding approach
Authors: G. L. Alfimov, A. P. Fedotov, Ya. A. Murenkov, D. A. Zezyulin
Abstract: We consider stationary states of an effectively one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate in a quasiperiodic lattice. We formulate sufficient conditions for a one-to-one correspondence between the stationary states with a fixed chemical potential and the set of bi-infinite sequences over a finite alphabet. These conditions can be checked numerically. A bi-infinite sequence can be interpreted as a code of the corresponding solution. A numerical example demonstrates the coding approach using an alphabet of three symbols.

Title: Engineering correlated disorder for exotic light scattering diagrams
Authors: Denis Langevin, Emma Bosbaty-Galliot, Emmanuel Centeno, Pauline Bennet, Rémi Carminati, Bodo D. Wilts, Patrick Bouchon, Antoine Moreau
Abstract: Diffuse scattering of light from disordered assemblies is traditionally viewed as an uncontrollable broadband scattering background resulting in whitish hues. Here, we demonstrate that correlated disorder enables precise engineering of light scattering from 2D arrays of emitters resulting in strong observable colors. Our analytical framework shows that introducing controlled noise, with tunable probability density functions and correlations, generates three distinct scattering components: diffraction orders, diffuse background, and correlation halos. Correlation halos, often mistaken for broadened diffraction peaks, are independent features whose positions depend on correlation range and can appear between Bragg peaks. Crucially, they persist far beyond the regime where diffraction orders vanish. The noise probability density function provides an additional control: specific diffraction orders can be selectively suppressed while preserving others. This approach reproduces the scattering signatures of natural photonic structures, e.g. found in Morpho butterflies, and reveals multiple pathways from order to disorder, each with distinct optical properties. Our work provides a practical method for inverse design -finding the disorder that produces desired scattering patterns. This establishes diffuse scattering as a designable quantity, expanding the toolkit for metasurfaces and structural color beyond periodic and hyperuniform structures.

Title: Phonon-enhanced strain sensitivity of quantum dots in two-dimensional semiconductors
Authors: Sumitra Shit, Yunus Waheed, Jithin Thoppil Surendran, Indrajeet Dhananjay Prasad, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Santosh Kumar
Abstract: Two-dimensional semiconductors have attracted considerable interest for integration into emerging quantum photonic networks. Strain engineering of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (ML-TMDs) enables the tuning of light-matter interactions and associated optoelectronic properties, and generates new functionalities, including the formation of quantum dots (QDs). Here, we combine spatially resolved micro-photoluminescence ($\mu$-PL) spectroscopy from cryogenic (4$\text{-}$94 K) to room temperature with micro-Raman spectroscopy at room temperature to investigate the strain-dependent emission energies of thousands of individual QDs in ML-WS$_2$ and ML-WSe$_2$, integrated across multiple heterostructures and a piezoelectric device. Compared with delocalized excitons, QDs in both materials exhibit enhanced strain sensitivities of their emission energies $-$ approximately fourfold in WS$_2$ and twofold in WSe$_2$ $-$ leading to pronounced broadening of the ensemble emission linewidth. Temperature-dependent $\mu$-PL spectroscopy combined with dynamic strain tuning experiments further reveal that the enhanced strain sensitivity of individual QDs originates from strengthened interactions with low-energy phonons induced by quantum confinement. Our results demonstrate a versatile strain-engineering approach with potential for spectral matching across solid-state, atomic, and hybrid quantum photonic networks, and provide new insights into phonon-QD interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Near-single-domain superconducting aluminum films on GaAs(111)A with exceptional crystalline quality for scalable quantum circuits
Authors: Hsien-Wen Wan, Yi-Ting Cheng, Chao-Kai Cheng, Jui-Min Chia, Chien-Ting Wu, Sheng-Shiuan Yeh, Chia-Hung Hsu, Jueinai Kwo, Minghwei Hong
Abstract: We have reproducibly grown near-single-domain superconducting aluminum (Al) films on GaAs(111)A wafers using molecular beam epitaxy. Synchrotron X-ray diffraction revealed twin-domain ratios of 0.00005 and 0.0003 for 19.4-nm- and 9.6-nm-thick films, respectively-the lowest reported for Al on any substrate and long considered unattainable for practical device platforms. Azimuthal scans across off-normal Al{$11\bar{1}$} reflections exhibit narrow full width at half maximum (FWHM) values down to $0.55^\circ$, unmatched by epi-Al grown by any other method. Normal scans showed a well-defined (111) orientation with pronounced Pendellösung fringes, and $\theta$-rocking-curve FWHM values down to $0.018^\circ$; the former indicates abrupt film-substrate and oxide-film interfaces. Electron backscatter diffraction mapping confirms macroscopic in-plane uniformity and the absence of $\Sigma$3 twin domains. Atomic force microscopy and scanning transmission electron microscopy confirmed atomically smooth surfaces and abrupt heterointerfaces. The films exhibit critical temperatures approaching bulk values, establishing a materials platform for scalable, high-coherence superconducting qubits.

Title: Optimal speed-up of multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols
Authors: Marco Peluso, Reinhold Egger, Andrea Nava
Abstract: The classical Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon where hotter water freezes faster than colder water due to the breakdown of Newton's law of cooling after a sudden temperature quench. The genuine nonequilibrium post-quench dynamics allows the system to evolve along effective shortcuts absent in the quasi-static regime. When the time needed for preparing the (classical or quantum) system in the hotter initial state is included, we encounter so-called Pontus-Mpemba effects. We here investigate multi-step Pontus-Mpemba protocols for open quantum systems whose dynamics is governed by time-inhomogeneous Lindblad master equations. In the limit of infinitely many steps, one arrives at continuous Pontus-Mpemba protocols. We study the crossover between the quasi-static and the sudden-quench regime, showing the presence of dynamically generated shortcuts achieved for time-dependent dissipation rates. Time-dependent rates can also cause non-Markovian behavior, highlighting the existence of rich dynamical regimes accessible beyond the Markovian framework.

Title: Dissipative charging of tight-binding quantum batteries
Authors: Mingdi Xu, Yiming Liu, Yefeng Song, Xiang-Ping Jiang, Lei Pan
Abstract: We investigate autonomous dissipative charging mechanisms for lattice quantum batteries within the framework of open quantum systems. Focusing on engineered Markovian dissipation, we show that appropriately designed Lindblad jump operators can drive tight-binding systems into highly excited band-edge states, resulting in steady states with large ergotropy. We illustrate this mechanism in a one-dimensional tight-binding chain and in a two-dimensional graphene lattice. We find that disorder enhances the charging power, indicating that dissipation-assisted localization effects can be beneficial for energy storage. Moreover, the dissipative charging process remains robust against additional local dephasing noise. Our results establish bond dissipation as an effective and physically transparent mechanism for charging lattice quantum batteries in realistic open-system settings.

Title: g4chargeit: Geant4-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of charging in dielectric materials
Authors: Kush P. Gandhi, Advik D. Vira, William M. Farrell, Nikolai Simonov, Alvaro Romero-Calvo, Thomas M. Orlando, Phillip N. First, Zhigang Jiang
Abstract: We present g4chargeit, a kinetic Monte Carlo framework built on Geant4 for self-consistent simulation of time-dependent electrostatic charging in dielectric materials. The model explicitly incorporates stochastic particle transport and scattering processes using validated Geant4 cross-sections, while self-consistently evolving the electric potential and field. As a representative application, we simulate the charging of regolith grains under average dayside conditions on the Moon. The surface of the Moon, in addition to other airless planetary bodies, are regularly exposed to solar ultraviolet photons and solar-wind plasma, creating a radiation environment in which electrostatic interactions among regolith grains become significant. Until now, simulations of regolith charging have often relied on analytical approximations that oversimplify grain geometry and interaction mechanisms. Our Geant4-based simulations reveal charge accumulation within intergrain micro-cavities, leading to repulsive electrostatic forces consistent with experimental observations. The framework establishes a multiscale approach that links microscopic scattering events to the continuity equation of surface charge density and to the formation of macroscopic surface charge patches in complex grain geometries. Although demonstrated here for planetary regolith, the method is general and applicable to a broad range of dielectric charging problems. The code is openly available at this https URL.

Title: Detecting nonequilibrium phase transitions via continuous monitoring of space-time trajectories and autoencoder-based clustering
Authors: Erik Fitzner, Francesco Carnazza, Federico Carollo, Igor Lesanovsky
Abstract: The characterization of collective behavior and nonequilibrium phase transitions in quantum systems is typically rooted in the analysis of suitable system observables, so-called order parameters. These observables might not be known a priori, but they may in principle be identified through analyzing the quantum state of the system. Experimentally, this can be particularly demanding as estimating quantum states and expectation values of quantum observables requires a large number of projective measurements. However, open quantum systems can be probed in situ by monitoring their output, e.g. via heterodyne-detection or photon-counting experiments, which provide space-time resolved information about their dynamics. Building on this, we present a machine-learning approach to detect nonequilibrium phase transitions from the measurement time-records of continuously-monitored quantum systems. We benchmark our method using the quantum contact process, a model featuring an absorbing-state phase transition, which constitutes a particularly challenging test case for the quantum simulation of nonequilibrium processes.

Title: Shortcut learning in geometric knot classification
Authors: Djordje Mihajlovic, Davide Michieletto
Abstract: Classifying the topology of closed curves is a central problem in low dimensional topology with applications beyond mathematics spanning protein folding, polymer physics and even magnetohydrodynamics. The central problem is how to determine whether two embeddings of a closed arc are equivalent under ambient isotopy. Given the striking ability of neural networks to solve complex classification tasks, it is therefore natural to ask if the knot classification problem can be tackled using Machine Learning (ML). In this paper, we investigate generic shortcut methods employed by ML to solve the knot classification challenge and specifically discover hidden non-topological features in training data generated through Molecular Dynamics simulations of polygonal knots that are used by ML to arrive to positive classifications results. We then provide a rigorous foundation for future attempts to tackle the knot classification challenge using ML by developing a publicly-available (i) dataset, that aims to remove the potential of non-topological feature classification and (ii) code, that can generate knot embeddings that faithfully explore chosen geometric state space with fixed knot topology. We expect that our work will accelerate the development of ML models that can solve complex geometric knot classification challenges.

Title: Evidence for Multimodal Superfluidity of Neutrons
Authors: Yuan-Zhuo Ma, Georgios Palkanoglou, Joseph Carlson, Stefano Gandolfi, Alexandros Gezerlis, Gabriel Given, Ashe Hicks, Dean Lee, Kevin E. Schmidt, Jiabin Yu
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental evidence for a new phase of matter in neutron-rich systems that we call multimodal superfluidity. Using ab initio lattice calculations, we show that the condensate consists of coexisting s-wave pairs, p-wave pairs in entangled double pair combinations, and quartets composed of bound states of two s-wave pairs. We identify multimodal superfluidity as a general feature of single-flavor spin-1/2 fermionic systems with attractive s-wave and p-wave interactions, provided the system is stable against collapse into a dense droplet. Beyond neutrons at sub-saturation densities, we demonstrate that this phase appears in generalized attractive extended Hubbard models in one, two, and three dimensions. We elucidate the mechanism for this coexistence using self-consistent few-body Cooper models and compare with Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer theory. We also derive the form of the effective action and show that spin, rotational, and parity symmetries remain unbroken. Finally, we analyze experimental data to show that p-wave pair gaps and quartet gaps are present in atomic nuclei, and we discuss the consequences of this new phase for the structure and dynamics of neutron star crusts.

Title: A Study of Entanglement and Ansatz Expressivity for the Transverse-Field Ising Model using Variational Quantum Eigensolver
Authors: Ashutosh P. Tripathi, Nilmani Mathur, Vikram Tripathi
Abstract: The Variational Quantum Eigensolver (VQE) is a leading hybrid quantum-classical algorithm for simulating many-body systems in the NISQ era. Its effectiveness, however, depends on the faithful preparation of eigenstates, which becomes challenging in degenerate and strongly entangled regimes. We study this problem using the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) with periodic boundary conditions in one, two, and three dimensions, considering systems of up to 27 qubits. We employ different ansatzes: the hardware-efficient EfficientSU2 from Qiskit, the physics-inspired Hamiltonian Variational Ansatz (HVA) and HVA with symmetry breaking, and benchmark their performance using energy variance, entanglement entropy, spin correlations, and magnetization.

Title: Weyl semimetallic state with antiferromagnetic order in Rashba-Hubbard model
Authors: Aastha Jain, Garima Goyal, Dheeraj Kumar Singh
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of Rashba-Hubbard model by employing the Hartree-Fock meanfield theory, and thereby establish the existence of an antiferromagnetically ordered Weyl semimetallic state with in-plane magnetic moments. This phase is found to be sandwiched in between the antiferromagnetic insulator and Rashba metal in the interaction vs spin-orbit coupling phase diagram. The antiferromagnetically-ordered topological semimetallic state exists in the presence of combined time-reversal and inversion symmetry though individually both are broken. The study of the static magnetic susceptibility indicates the robustness of the antiferromagnetic order within a realistic range of interaction and spin-orbit coupling parameters. In addition to the edge states associated with the Weyl points, we also investigate the spin-resolved quasiparticle interference, which provides important insight into the possible spin texture of the bands especially in the vicinity of Weyl points.

Title: Doping-induced evolution of the intrinsic hump and dip energies dependent on the sample fabrication conditions in Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+δ}$
Authors: Tatsuya Honma
Abstract: In oxygen-doped Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+\delta}$, the spectra, as observed by tunneling or photoemission spectroscopic measurements, depend on the sample fabrication conditions, such as the temperature and pressure for fabricating the junction or surface. This implies that the hump and dip energies extracted from the spectra depend on the sample fabrication conditions. When the samples were fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under ultra-high vacuum (UHV), the hump energy exhibited a new step-like doping dependence and the dip energy followed the upper pseudo-gap line. As the fabrication conditions deteriorated, the hump and dip energies reproduced the previous results, in that the dip energy was significantly dependent on the sample, whereas the hump energy exhibited a smooth doping dependence. It can be concluded that the observations for the samples fabricated at 4.2 K and/or under UHV reflect the intrinsic bulk properties, whereas those for the samples fabricated under deteriorated conditions reflect degraded surface properties.

Title: Enhanced transverse electron transport via disordered composite formation
Authors: Sang J. Park, Hojun Lee, Jongjun M. Lee, Jangwoo Ha, Hyun-Woo Lee, Hyungyu Jin
Abstract: Transverse electron transport in magnetic materials - manifested in effects such as the anomalous Hall and Nernst effects - holds promise for spintronic and thermoelectric applications. While recent advances have focused on enhancing such transport through topological single crystals via intrinsic mechanisms linked to Berry curvature, practical limitations remain due to their mechanical fragility and narrow material scope. Here, we demonstrate a distinct approach for transverse transport enhancement based on composite formation. Using both theoretical modeling and experiments, we show that disordered mixtures of two ferromagnetic materials can exhibit significantly stronger transverse electron deflection than either constituent alone. This enhancement originates from meandering electron pathways created by the disordered mixture of two materials and does not rely on long-range crystalline order. The identified requirements for this mechanism can be broadly satisfied across different material systems, offering a universal and tunable strategy to engineer large transverse responses in structurally robust platforms.

Title: The Eggbox Ising Model
Authors: Mutian Shen, Yichen Xu, Zohar Nussinov
Abstract: We introduce the Eggbox Ising model, a tunable construction of rugged energy landscapes defined by distances to a prescribed set of patterns. Correlated pattern ensembles realize arbitrary k-step replica-symmetry-breaking structures and controllable Parisi overlap distributions p(q), consistent with the hierarchical overlap structure observed in a simple word-embedding example from empirical data. A softened variant allows a systematic expansion leading to Hopfield-type couplings (and higher-body terms). We analyze the density of states and show that suitable potentials induce discontinuous finite-temperature transitions with metastability and hysteresis.

Title: Understanding entropy production via a thermal zero-player game
Authors: M. Süzen
Abstract: Understanding the natural bounds of entropy production for driven nonequi- librium dynamics in many-body systems reveals how the fundamentals of thermodynamics manifest in these regimes across a wide variety of systems. In this direction, we propose and study the dynamics of a thermal zero-player entropy game, the Ising-Conway Entropy Game (ICEg), a self-driven system exhibiting characteristics of lattice gases, Ising models, and discrete games. We show that there is a universal bound on the entropy production rate, independent of temperature and lattice size. The thermalized game is shown to be physically interesting and a plausible testbed for studying the fundamentals of stochastic thermodynamics.

Title: Revealing Rotational Symmetry Breaking Charge-density Wave Order in Kagome Superconductor (Rb, K)V$_3$Sb$_5$ by Ultrafast Pump-probe Experiments
Authors: Qinwen Deng, Hengxin Tan, Brenden R. Ortiz, Stephen D. Wilson, Binghai Yan, Liang Wu
Abstract: The recently discovered Kagome superconductor AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (where A refers to K, Rb, Cs) has stimulated widespread research interest due to its interplay of non-trivial topology and unconventional correlated physics including charge-density waves (CDW) and superconductivity. The essential prerequisite to understanding the microscopic mechanisms of this complex electronic landscape is to unveil the configuration and symmetry of the charge-density wave order. As to now, little consensus has been made on what symmetry is broken. Herein, we clarify the microscopic structure and symmetry breaking of the CDW phase in RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$ by ultrafast time-resolved reflectivity. Our approach is based on extracting coherent phonon spectra induced by three-dimensional CDW and comparing them to calculated phonon frequencies via density-functional theory. The combination of these experimental results and calculations provides compelling evidence that the CDW structure of both compounds prevailing up to T$_{\text{CDW}}$ is the 2 $\times$ 2 $\times$ 2 staggered inverse Star-of-David pattern with interlayer $\pi$ phase shift, in which the six-fold rotational symmetry is broken. These observations thus corroborate six-fold rotational symmetry breaking throughout the CDW phase of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$ and KV$_3$Sb$_5$.

Title: Magnetic moment of electrons in systems with spin-orbit coupling
Authors: I. A. Ado, M. Titov, Rembert A. Duine, Arne Brataas
Abstract: Magnetic effects originating from spin-orbit coupling (SOC) have been attracting major attention. However, SOC contributions to the electron magnetic moment operator are conventionally disregarded. In this work, we analyze relativistic contributions to the latter operator, including those of the SOC-type: in vacuum, for the semiconductor 8 band Kane model, and for an arbitrary system with two spectral branches. In this endeavor, we introduce a notion of relativistic corrections to the operation $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $\boldsymbol B$ is an external magnetic field. We highlight the difference between the magnetic moment and $-\partial H/\partial\boldsymbol B$, where $H$ is the system Hamiltonian. We suggest to call this difference the abnormal magnetic moment. We demonstrate that the conventional decomposition of the total magnetic moment into the spin and orbital parts becomes ambiguous when relativistic corrections are taken into account. The latter also jeopardize the "modern theory of orbital magnetization" in its standard formulation. We derive a linear response Kubo formula for the kinetic magnetoelectric effect projected to individual branches of a two branch system. This allows us, in particular, to identify a source of this effect that stems from noncommutation of the position and $\partial/\partial\boldsymbol B$ operators' components. This is an analog of the contribution to the Hall conductivity from noncommuting components of the position operator. We comment on the relation between such contributions and the Berry curvature theory. We also report several additional observations related to the electron magnetic moment operator in systems with SOC and other relativistic corrections.

Title: Anomalous Chiral Anomaly in Spin-1 Fermionic Systems
Authors: Shantonu Mukherjee, Sayantan Sharma, Hridis K. Pal
Abstract: Chiral anomaly is a key feature of Lorentz-invariant quantum field theories: in presence of parallel external electric and magnetic fields, the number of massless Weyl fermions of a given chirality is not conserved. In condensed matter, emergent chiral fermions in Weyl semimetals exhibit the same anomaly, directly tied to the topological charge of the Weyl node, ensuring a quantized anomaly coefficient. However, many condensed matter systems break Lorentz symmetry while retaining topological nodes, raising the question of how chiral anomaly manifests in such settings. In this work, we investigate this question in spin-1 fermionic systems and show that the conventional anomaly equation is modified by an additional nontopological contribution, leading to a nonquantized anomaly coefficient. This surprising result arises because spin-1 fermions can be decomposed into 2-flavor Weyl fermions coupled to a Lorentz-breaking, momentum-dependent non-Abelian background potential. The interplay between this potential and external electromagnetic fields generates the extra term in the anomaly equation. Our framework naturally generalizes to other Lorentz-breaking systems beyond the spin-1 case.

Title: Predicted third-order sweet spots for phi-junction Josephson parametric amplifiers
Authors: Tasnum Reza, Sergey M. Frolov
Abstract: Hybrid superconductor-semiconductor nanowire Josephson junctions exhibit skewed and phi-shifted current phase relations when an in-plane magnetic field is applied along the weak link's spin-orbit effective field direction. These junctions can have an asymmetric Josephson potential with odd-order nonlinearities. A dominant third-order nonlinearity can be achieved by tuning the magnetic field to a sweet spot. Sweet spots persist when higher order Josephson harmonics are included. This makes it possible to have a single Josephson junction dipole element with three-wave mixing capability, which is favorable for pump-efficient amplification. Electrostatic gate tunability of the semiconductor weak link can make it operable within an extended range of working frequencies, and the inclusion of micromagnets can facilitate near-zero magnetic field operation.

Title: Violation of local reciprocity in charge-orbital interconversion
Authors: Hisanobu Kashiki, Hiroki Hayashi, Dongwook Go, Yuriy Mokrousov, Kazuya Ando
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of local reciprocity in the interconversion between charge and orbital currents. By investigating orbital torque and orbital pumping in W/Ni bilayers, we show that the charge-orbital interconversion in the bulk of the W layer exhibits opposite signs in the direct and inverse processes -- the direct and inverse orbital Hall effects being positive and negative, respectively. This finding provides direct evidence of local nonreciprocity in the charge-orbital interconversion, in agreement with a theoretical prediction. These results highlight the unique characteristics of charge-orbital coupled transport and offer fundamental insights into the mechanisms underlying orbital-current-driven phenomena.

Title: Inferring entropy production in many-body systems using nonequilibrium maximum entropy
Authors: Miguel Aguilera, Sosuke Ito, Artemy Kolchinsky
Abstract: We propose a method for inferring entropy production (EP) in high-dimensional stochastic systems, including many-body systems and non-Markovian systems with long memory. Standard techniques for estimating EP become intractable in such systems due to computational and statistical limitations. We infer trajectory-level EP and lower bounds on average EP by exploiting a nonequilibrium analogue of the Maximum Entropy principle, along with convex duality. Our approach uses only samples of trajectory observables, such as spatiotemporal correlations. It does not require reconstruction of high-dimensional probability distributions or rate matrices, nor impose any special assumptions such as discrete states or multipartite dynamics. In addition, it may be used to compute a hierarchical decomposition of EP, reflecting contributions from different interaction orders, and it has an intuitive physical interpretation as a "thermodynamic uncertainty relation." We demonstrate its numerical performance on a disordered nonequilibrium spin model with 1000 spins and a large neural spike-train dataset.

Title: Coercivity Landscape Characterizes Dynamic Hysteresis
Authors: Miao Chen, Xiu-Hua Zhao, Yu-Han Ma
Abstract: Hysteresis, with rich dynamical behaviors-especially in interacting systems-has drawn broad research interest. Yet its dynamic scalings across time scales lack a unified description, and their transitions remain unclear. Here, we study the stochastic $\phi^4$ model driven periodically by an external field $H$. For large systems with small noise strength $\sigma$, we find the coercivity $H_c \equiv H(\langle\phi\rangle=0)$ sequentially exhibits distinct behaviors with increasing driving rate $v_H$: $v_H$-scaling increase, stable plateau ($v_H^0$), $v_H^{1/2}$-scaling increase, and abrupt decline to disappearance. The plateau reflects the competition between thermodynamic and quasi-static limits, namely, $\lim_{\sigma\to 0}\lim_{v_H\to 0}H_c = 0$, and $\lim_{v_H\to 0}\lim_{\sigma\to 0}H_c=H^*$. Here, $H^*$ is exactly the field-driven first-order phase transition point. In the post-plateau regime, $(H_{c} - H_{P})$ scales with $(v_{H} - v_{P})^{2/3}$ with $v_{P}$ and $H_{P}$ being the reference points of the plateau. Moreover, we reveal a finite-size scaling for the coercivity plateau as $v_{P}\sim\sigma^{2}$ and $(H^*-H_P)\sim\sigma^{4/3}$ by utilizing renormalization-group theory. Our work provides a panoramic view of finite-time scalings of the hysteresis and offers new insights into finite-time/finite-size effect interplay in non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Phase field dislocation dynamics formulation coupled with Fourier based micromechanics solver and its application to grain boundary-dislocation interactions
Authors: Brayan Murgas, Avanish Mishra, Nithin Mathew, Abigail Hunter
Abstract: A new phase field dislocation dynamics formulation is presented, which couples micromechanical solvers and the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation. Grain boundary (GB)-dislocation interactions are studied by describing GBs as inclusions. Grain boundary properties are computed from Molecular Statics simulations and an additional contribution to the total energy that takes into account the GB energy is considered in the calculations. Interaction of a screw dislocation with minimum energy and metastable states of low and high angle $\langle$110$\rangle$ symmetric tilt grain boundaries are studied. We show good agreement between predictions from our phase field dislocation dynamics formulation and molecular dynamics simulations of grain boundary-dislocation interactions.

Title: Odd relaxation in three-dimensional Fermi liquids
Authors: Seth Musser, Sankar Das Sarma, Johannes Hofmann
Abstract: Recent theoretical works predict a hierarchy of long-lived, non-hydrodynamic modes in two-dimensional Fermi liquids arising from the feature$-$supposedly unique to two dimensions$-$that relaxation by head-on scattering is not efficient in the presence of Pauli blocking. This leads to a parity-based separation of scattering rates, with odd-parity modes relaxing much more slowly than even-parity ones. In this work, we establish that a similar effect exists in isotropic three-dimensional (3D) Fermi liquids, even though relaxation does not proceed solely by head-on scattering. We show that while the relaxation rates of even and odd modes in 3D share the same leading-order $\sim T^2$ low-temperature scaling typical of Fermi liquids, their magnitudes differ, with odd-parity modes relaxing more slowly than even ones for a broad class of interactions. We find a relative difference between odd-parity and even-parity relaxation rates as large as $40\%$ just by Pauli blocking alone, with a strong additional dependence on the scattering potential, such that the odd-even staggering is further enhanced by interactions that favor large-angle scattering. We identify signatures of these odd-parity relaxation rates in the static transverse conductivity as well as the transverse collective mode structure. Our results establish the unexpected existence of a tomographic like regime in higher-dimensional Fermi liquids and suggest experimental probes via transport measurements.

Title: Quantizing Bosonized Fermi Surfaces
Authors: Sihan Chen, Luca V. Delacretaz
Abstract: Bosonization describes Fermi surface dynamics in terms of a collective field that lives on a part of phase space. While sensible semiclassically, the challenge of treating such a field quantum mechanically has prevented bosonization from providing as powerful a nonperturbative tool as in one dimension. We show that general Fermi surfaces can be exactly described by a particular $N\to \infty$ limit of a $U(N)_1$ WZW model, with a tower of irrelevant corrections. This matrix-valued description encodes the noncommutative nature of phase space, and its (solvable) strongly coupled dynamics resolves the naive overcounting of degrees of freedom of the collective field without the need to cut the Fermi surface into patches. This approach furthermore provides a quantitative tool to systematically study power-law corrections to Fermi surface dynamics.

Title: Excluded volume geometry and packing fraction in binary convex hyperparticle mixtures
Authors: H.J.H. Brouwers
Abstract: In this paper the excluded volume of binary similar hyperparticles with small size difference in D-dimensional Euclidean spaces R2, R3, and R4 is studied using two different statistical geometry approaches. These geometric approaches, concerning orientation geometry and integral geometry, yield the excluded volume of particle pairs. The excluded volume of rectangles, based on orientation geometry, in Euclidean space R2 is used to derive an explicit equation for the bidisperse packing fraction, which is compatible with the expression published previously. Next, the excluded volume of pairs of convex particles in D = 2, 3 and 4, resulting from integral geometry, are presented. These excluded volumes are identical with the specific ones for circles and rectangles (D = 2) and (sphero)cylinders (D = 3), derived by orientation geometry. Furthermore, these orientation geometry-based excluded volumes contain geometric measures: particle volume, surface area, mean curvature and the second quermassintegral. They allow for the derivation of closed-form expressions for the random packing fraction of binary convex similar hyperparticles in Euclidean spaces R2 , R3 and R4.

Title: Precision of an autonomous demon exploiting nonthermal resources and information
Authors: Juliette Monsel, Matteo Acciai, Didrik Palmqvist, Nicolas Chiabrando, Rafael Sánchez, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: Quantum-dot systems serve as nanoscale heat engines exploiting thermal fluctuations to perform a useful task. Here, we investigate a multi-terminal triple-dot system, operating as a refrigerator that extracts heat from a cold electronic contact. In contrast to standard heat engines, this system exploits a nonthermal resource. This has the intriguing consequence that cooling can occur without extracting energy from the resource on average -- a seemingly demonic action -- while, however, requiring the resource to fluctuate. Using full counting statistics and stochastic trajectories, we analyze the performance of the device in terms of the cooling-power precision, employing performance quantifiers motivated by the thermodynamic and kinetic uncertainty relations. We focus on two regimes with large output power, which are based on two operational principles: exploiting information on one hand and the nonthermal properties of the resource on the other. We show that these regimes significantly differ in precision. In particular, the regime exploiting the nonthermal properties of the resource can have cooling-power fluctuations that are suppressed with respect to the input fluctuations by an order of magnitude. We also substantiate the interpretation of the two different working principles by analyzing cross-correlations between input and output heat currents and information flow.

Title: Krylov Complexity Meets Confinement
Authors: Xuhao Jiang, Jad C. Halimeh, N. S. Srivatsa
Abstract: In high-energy physics, confinement denotes the tendency of fundamental particles to remain bound together, preventing their observation as free, isolated entities. Interestingly, analogous confinement behavior emerges in certain condensed matter systems, for instance, in the Ising model with both transverse and longitudinal fields, where domain walls become confined into meson-like bound states as a result of a longitudinal field-induced linear potential. In this work, we employ the Ising model to demonstrate that Krylov state complexity--a measure quantifying the spread of quantum information under the repeated action of the Hamiltonian on a quantum state--serves as a sensitive and quantitative probe of confinement. We show that confinement manifests as a pronounced suppression of Krylov complexity growth following quenches within the ferromagnetic phase in the presence of a longitudinal field, reflecting slow correlation dynamics. In contrast, while quenches within the paramagnetic phase exhibit enhanced complexity with increasing longitudinal field, reflecting the absence of confinement, those crossing the critical point to the ferromagnetic phase reveal a distinct regime characterized by orders-of-magnitude larger complexity and display trends of weak confinement. Notably, in the confining regime, the complexity oscillates at frequencies corresponding to the meson masses, with its power-spectrum peaks closely matching the semiclassical predictions.

Title: Fokker-Planck approach for thermal fluctuations in antiferromagnetic systems
Authors: E. Martello, G. A. Falci, E. Paladino, F. M. D. Pellegrino
Abstract: We develop a Fokker-Planck approach to describe the dynamics of staggered magnetization and thermal fluctuations in a two-dimensional antiferromagnetic system with uniaxial anisotropy. Beginning with a classical model for the antiferromagnetic system, we incorporate a Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation augmented by Langevin fields to account for thermal fluctuations, and we derive the Fokker-Planck equation governing the probability distribution function of the spin configuration. Employing the mean-field approximation, we derive the equations of motion for the spin polarization and the two-time spin-spin correlation functions. The methodology is applied to the study of spin-wave dynamics and to the formulation of a phenomenological model for resistance fluctuations in two-dimensional antiferromagnetic semiconductors.

Title: Impact of Carrier Injector Design on the Threshold of Interband Cascade Lasers
Authors: T. Sato, B. Petrović, R. Weih, F. Hartmann, S. Höfling, S. Birner, C. Jirauschek, T. Grange
Abstract: We theoretically investigate how the injector region design of interband cascade lasers (ICLs) impacts the threshold carrier and current densities. The model combines a polarization-sensitive 8-band $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ calculation, electrostatics, and a microscopic calculation of Auger recombination rates. The inelastic carrier-carrier scattering is included to lowest order using quasi-equilibrium Green's functions. It captures the combined effects of charge-carrier redistribution, parasitic absorption, and bias voltage on the Auger recombination rate. We show that heavily doping the electron injector suppresses the dominant multi-hole Auger recombination by reducing the hole population of the recombination quantum wells. This agrees with the experimental observation that the heavy doping reduces threshold currents. Unlike the measurements, however, they do not increase at high doping concentrations in our model, which does not include scattering-mediated carrier escape and/or light absorption. Furthermore, by introducing indium to the conventional $\mathrm{Ga}\mathrm{Sb}$ hole injector wells, we explain the rule of thumb from experiments that raising the hole injector levels does not outperform the doping strategy. Our model provides physical insights for optimizing ICL carrier injectors.

Title: The geometric control of boundary-catalytic branching processes
Authors: Denis S. Grebenkov, Yilin Ye
Abstract: Boundary-catalytic branching processes describe a broad class of natural phenomena where the population of diffusing particles grows due to their spontaneous binary branching (e.g., division, fission or splitting) on a catalytic boundary located in a complex environment. We investigate the possibility of the geometric control of the population growth by compensating the proliferation of particles due to catalytic branching events by their absorptions in the bulk or on absorbing regions of the boundary. We identify an appropriate Steklov spectral problem to obtain the phase diagram of this out-of-equilibrium stochastic process. The principal eigenvalue determines the critical line that separates an exponential growth of the population from its extinction in a bounded domain. In other words, we establish a powerful tool for calculating the optimal absorption rate that equilibrates the opposite effects of branching and absorption events and thus results in steady-state behavior of this diffusion-reaction system. Moreover, we show the existence of a critical catalytic rate above which no compensation is possible, so that the population cannot be controlled and keeps growing exponentially. The proposed framework opens promising perspectives for better understanding, modeling and control of various boundary-catalytic branching processes, with applications in physics, chemistry, and life sciences.

Title: Atomic forces from correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem
Authors: Damian Contant, Maria Hellgren
Abstract: We extend the capabilities of correlation energy functionals based on the adiabatic-connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem by implementing the analytical atomic forces within the random phase approximation (RPA), in the context of plane waves and pseudopotentials. Forces are calculated at self-consistency through the optimized effective potential method and the Hellmann-Feynman theorem. In addition, non-self-consistent RPA forces, starting from the PBE generalized gradient approximation, are evaluated using density functional perturbation theory. In both cases, we find forces of excellent numerical quality. Furthermore, for most molecules and solids studied, self-consistency is found to have a negligible impact on the computed geometries and vibrational frequencies. The RPA is shown to systematically improve over PBE and, by including the exact-exchange kernel within RPA + exchange (RPAx), through finite-difference total energy calculations, we obtain an accuracy comparable to advanced wavefunction methods. Finally, we estimate the anharmonic shift and provide accurate theoretical references based on RPA and RPAx for the zone-center optical phonon of diamond, silicon, and germanium.

Title: Global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories
Authors: Yuanran Zhu, Yang Yu, Efekan Kökcü, Emanuel Gull, Chao Yang
Abstract: We introduce a method for constructing global approximations to correlation functions of strongly interacting quantum field theories, starting from perturbative results. The key idea is to employ interpolation method, such as the two-point Padé expansion, to interpolate the weak and strong coupling expansions of correlation function. We benchmark this many-body interpolation approach on two prototypical models: the lattice $\phi^4$ field theory and the 2D Hubbard model. For the $\phi^4$ theory, the resulting two point Padé approximants exhibit uniform and global convergence to the exact correlation function. For the Hubbard model, we show that even at second order, the Padé appproximant already provides reasonable characterization of the Matsubara Green's function for a wide range of parameters. Finally, we offer a heuristic explanation for these convergence properties based on analytic function theory.

Title: Weyl Magnons in the Non-Coplanar Antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$
Authors: Ahmed E. Fahmy, Archibald J. Williams, Yufei Li, Thuc T. Mai, Kevin F. Garrity, Matthew B. Stone, Mohammed J. Karaki, Sara Haravifard, Angela R. Hight Walker, Rolando Valdés Aguilar, Joshua E. Goldberger, Yuan-Ming Lu
Abstract: Using a combination of band representation analysis, inelastic neutron scattering (INS), magneto-Raman spectroscopy measurements, and linear spin wave theory, we establish that the non-coplanar antiferromagnet MnTe$_2$ is a tunable Weyl magnon material, hosting symmetry-protected topological nodal lines in its magnon band structure, protected by the the non-coplanar nature of the antiferromagnetic ordering, that transition into Weyl magnons upon the application of symmetry-breaking perturbations using an external magnetic field. By constructing a spin model that reproduces the observed INS magnon spectra and field-dependence of the Raman $\Gamma$-magnons, we directly probe the topological magnon nodal lines and observe their associated signature of non-trivial topology through the pseudo-spin winding of the scattering intensity in angular scans near the nodal lines. Finally, we discuss how to induce Weyl magnons in the spectrum through an external magnetic field, shedding light on future in-field INS and thermal Hall experiments. This work establishes a clear magnonic analog to Weyl electrons, enabling further exploration of topological behavior in bosonic systems and highlighting the interplay between magnetic order and band topology in non-coplanar antiferromagnets.

Title: Vapor-solid-solid growth of single-walled carbon nanotubes
Authors: Daniel Hedman
Abstract: Single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) are promising for nanoscale electronics and photonics, but practical deployment requires chirality control. Most catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CCVD) growth of SWCNTs proceeds on liquid metal nanoparticles via a vapor-liquid-solid (VLS) mechanism and yields broad chirality distributions, whereas improved selectivity has been reported for high-melting-point crystalline catalysts, suggesting vapor-solid-solid (VSS) growth. However, the atomistic mechanism and kinetic of VSS SWCNT growth remain unclear. Here it is shown, using machine-learning interatomic potential-driven molecular dynamics on rhenium nanoparticles, that VSS growth is diffusion-limited and governed by facet-dependent surface carbon transport coupled to carbon-driven facet reconfiguration without catalyst melting. Surface diffusion is up to $\sim 50\times$ slower than carbon diffusion in liquid iron, imposing a strict upper bound on sustainable carbon supply and producing a narrow growth window: insufficient transport drives carbon accumulation and multiple nucleation, whereas higher temperatures favor graphitic encapsulation. In contrast to defect-free VLS growth, defects persist, indicating slow defect healing, and equilibrium simulations reveal suppressed edge configurational entropy with stabilization of zigzag-rich, Klein-decorated edges. Together, these results establish facet evolution and surface diffusion as joint regulators of diffusion-limited VSS growth and motivate stringent control of temperature and carbon supply.

Title: Cleavage toughness of single crystals
Authors: Faming Gao
Abstract: Griffith thermodynamic energy balance is employed to analyze cleavage phenomenon from atomic level. Results show that the cleavage toughness, the strain energy release rate, and the surface energy can be defined by the bond strength (the appropriate elastic modulus ) and the bond density. Such simple definition of fracture parameters is different from Irwin ones. This appropriate elastic modulus of single crystals is obtained using the complex variable function method. The calculated results of cleavage toughness and surface energy of typical ionic and covalent crystals by the present formulae are in excellent agreement with the experimental values. It demonstrates that our method offers a concise tool for predicting the cleavage toughness, the energy release rate and the surface energy of crystal cleavage planes.

Title: Advanced Manufacturing with Renewable and Bio-based Materials: AI/ML workflows and Process Optimization
Authors: Rigoberto Advincula, Jihua Chen
Abstract: Advanced manufacturing with new bio-derived materials can be achieved faster and more economically with first-principle-based artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML)-derived models and process optimization. Not only is this motivated by increased industry profitability, but it can also be optimized to reduce waste generation, energy consumption, and gas emissions through additive manufacturing (AM) and AI/ML-directed self-driving laboratory (SDL) process optimization. From this perspective, the benefits of using 3D printing technology to manufacture durable, sustainable materials will enable high-value reuse and promote a better circular economy. Using AI/ML workflows at different levels, it is possible to optimize the synthesis and adaptation of new bio-derived materials with self-correcting 3D printing methods, and in-situ characterization. Working with training data and hypotheses derived from Large Language Models (LLMs) and algorithms, including ML-optimized simulation, it is possible to demonstrate more field convergence. The combination of SDL and AI/ML Workflows can be the norm for improved use of biobased and renewable materials towards advanced manufacturing. This should result in faster and better structure, composition, processing, and properties (SCPP) correlation. More agentic AI tasks, as well as supervised or unsupervised learning, can be incorporated to improve optimization protocols continuously. Deep Learning (DL), Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) with Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) can be applied to more generative AI directions in both AM and SDL, with bio-based materials.

Title: Coexisting electronic smectic liquid crystal and superconductivity in a Si square-net semimetal
Authors: Christopher J. Butler, Toshiya Ikenobe, Ming-Chun Jiang, Daigorou Hirai, Takahiro Yamada, Guang-Yu Guo, Ryotaro Arita, Tetsuo Hanaguri, Zenji Hiroi
Abstract: Electronic nematic and smectic liquid crystals are spontaneous symmetry-breaking phases that are seen to precede or coexist with enigmatic unconventional superconducting states in multiple classes of materials. In this Letter we describe scanning tunneling microscopy observations of a short ranged charge stripe (smectic) order in NaAlSi, whose superconductivity is speculated to have an unconventional origin. As well as this we resolve a clear spatial modulation of the superconducting gap amplitude, which arises due to the intertwined superconducting and smectic orders. Numerical calculations help to understand the possible driving mechanism as a suppression of kinetic energy on the Fermi surface formed in part by two large, flat-topped hole pockets of p-orbital character.

Title: Thermodynamic assessment of the Ba-La-S and Ga-La-S systems
Authors: Jiayang Wang, Guangyu Hu, Pierre Lucas, Marat I. Latypov
Abstract: This paper presents the first thermodynamic assessment of binary and pseudo-binary phase diagrams in the Ba--La--S and Ga--La--S systems by means of the CALPHAD method. Experimental phase diagram equilibrium data and thermodynamic properties available from the literature were critically reviewed and assessed using thermodynamic models for the Gibbs energies of individual phases. The associated solution model was used to describe the short-range ordering behavior of the liquid phases. To supplement the limited experimental data reported in the literature, ab initio molecular dynamics calculations were employed to derive mixing enthalpies of the liquid phases in the binary subsystems. The resulting phase diagrams and calculated thermodynamic properties show good agreement with available literature within the investigated compositional ranges of binary and pseudo-binary systems.

Title: On Thermalization in A Nonlinear Variant of the Discrete NLS Equation
Authors: Yagmur Kati, Aleksandra Maluckov, Ana Mancic, Panayotis Kevrekidis
Abstract: We study the thermalization properties of a fully nonlinear lattice model originally derived from the two-dimensional cubic defocusing nonlinear Schrödinger equation (NLS) using analytical and numerical methods. Our analysis reveals both ergodic and nonergodic regimes; importantly, we find broad parameter ranges where the dynamics is ergodic even though it lies outside the Gibbsian parameter regime (for both $D=0.25$ and $D=2$), and a higher-energy range where ergodicity breaks down. We observe that in a certain range of parameters, the system requires non-standard statistical descriptions, indicating a breakdown of conventional thermalization. We examine the influence of the nonlinear dispersion parameter $D$ on the system's behavior, showing that increasing $D$ enhances fluctuations and speeds up the crossover of $q(T)$ toward the $\sim 1/T$ scaling. By analyzing excursion times, probability density functions, and localization patterns, we characterize transitions between ergodic and nonergodic behavior. In long-time numerical simulations within the non-ergodic regime for $D>1$, stable localization over two sites is observed, while $D<1$ favors single-site localization in the high energy density regimes. Our results provide insights into the interplay between thermalization, localization, and non-standard statistical behavior in genuinely nonlinear systems.

Title: Observation of a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in a distorted square net material

Abstract: Topological materials hold immense promise for exhibiting exotic quantum phenomena, yet achieving controllable topological phase transitions remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate a structurally driven, reversible topological phase transition in the distorted square net material GdPS, induced via in situ potassium dosing. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and first principles calculations, we demonstrate a cascade of topological phases in the sub-surface P layer: from a large, topologically trivial band gap to a gapless Dirac cone state with a 2 eV dispersion, and finally to a two-dimensional topological insulator as inferred from theory. This evolution is driven by subtle structural distortions in the first P layer caused by potassium adsorption, which in turn contribute to the band gap closure and topological phase transition. Furthermore, the ability to manipulate the topology of a sub-surface layer in GdPS offers a unique route for exploring and controlling topological states in bulk materials.

Title: Biaxial Strain Control of Helimagnetism via Chemical Expansion in Thin Film SrFeO3

Abstract: We demonstrate control of helimagnetic order in biaxially strained SrFeO3 thin films using neutron diffraction and resonant soft x-ray scattering. SrFeO3, a negative charge-transfer oxide, exhibits a complex magnetic phase diagram that includes multi-q spin structures. Tensile epitaxial strain produces a pronounced shortening of the helimagnetic ordering length and a tilting of the magnetic ordering vector. We interpret this behavior in terms of chemical expansion: lattice dilation under tensile strain lowers the energetic cost of oxygen vacancies, leading to an expanded unit cell that modifies Fe-O hybridization and enhances superexchange relative to double exchange. These results reveal how epitaxial strain can indirectly tune helimagnetism through defect-driven chemical expansion, highlighting the strong coupling between lattice, chemistry, and magnetic order in transition-metal oxides. Our findings establish chemical expansion as an effective mechanism for engineering complex magnetic textures in oxide thin films, with implications for spintronic, magnonic, and quantum information applications.

Title: Elastoresistance as probe of strain-controlled entropy from Kondo scattering
Authors: Soumendra Nath Panja, Jacques G. Pontanel, Julian Kaiser, Anton Jesche, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Heavy-fermion metals are prototype correlated electron systems for the study of Kondo entanglement and quantum criticality. We use the symmetry decomposed elastoresistance to uncover the fingerprints of strain-dependent Kondo scattering as function of temperature and magnetic field in the prototypical tetragonal Kondo lattice YbRh$_2$Si$_2$. By combining longitudinal and transverse resistance measurements under uniaxial strain applied along the tetragonal $[100]$ and $[110]$ directions, we obtain the elastoresistive responses in the $A_{1g}$, $B_{1g}$, and $B_{2g}$ symmetry channels. While the responses in the symmetry-breaking channels are negligible, the isotropic $A_{1g}$ elastoresistance displays characteristic sign changes and approaches huge values at low temperatures. Scaling analysis and comparison with linear thermal expansion measurements reveals that the elastoresistance probes the contribution of Kondo scattering to the strain dependence of magnetic entropy and signals strain-controlled quantum criticality upon cooling to 2 K.

Title: Mystery of the 175 cm$^{-1}$ Raman Mode in MnTe Altermagnet
Authors: Bishal Thapa, K. D. Belashchenko, Igor I. Mazin
Abstract: MnTe has recently attracted exceptional attention due to its well-established altermagnetism, prompting a thorough reexamination of its properties. In particular, it was found that a Raman-active excitation at ~175 cm$^{-1}$, routinely assigned to the E2g phonon, is incompatible with this interpretation. It was further hypothesized that this mode is a "leakage", due to symmetry lowering, of an otherwise forbidden phonon. Here, using first-principles calculations, we decisively rule out this hypothesis and propose an alternative interpretation that the "mystery mode" is an electronic excitation, i.e., a plasmon, enabled by hole self-doping. The resolution of this mystery will require additional experiments and shed new light on the nature of electronic transport in MnTe.

Authors: Marcus Djokic, Jose L. Mendoza-Cortes
Abstract: The development of efficient hydrogen storage materials is crucial for advancing the hydrogen economy and meeting the U.S. Department of Energy's targets of 6.5 wt% and 50 g H<sub>2</sub>/L for automotive applications. We present a computational study of ferrocene-functionalized covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for hydrogen storage. Following the <b>M</b>ulti-binding <b>S</b>ites <b>U</b>nited in <b>C</b>ovalent-<b>O</b>rganic <b>F</b>ramework (MSUCOF) approach, we introduce MSUCOF-4-FeCp, designed by incorporating ferrocene (FeCp<sub>2</sub>) moieties into IRCOF-102. Notably, it achieves exceptional performance with gravimetric and volumetric uptakes of 18.0 wt% and 72.6 g H<sub>2</sub>/L at 298 K and 700 bar. The material exhibits optimal binding energies (15-20 kJ/mol) ensuring both high storage capacity and deliverable hydrogen under practical conditions. This work establishes ferrocene functionalization as a cost-effective alternative to precious metal incorporation in COFs.

Title: Deciphering Majorana Zero Modes in Topological Superconductor FeTe0.55Se0.45 with Machine-Learning-Assisted Spectral Deconvolution
Authors: Jewook Park, Hoyeon Jeon, Dongwon Shin, Guannan Zhang, Michael A McGuire, Brian C. Sales, An-Ping Li
Abstract: Unambiguous identification of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in topological superconductors (TSCs) remains a challenge due to complex in-gap states that can also produce zero-bias conductance peaks (ZBPs). Here we demonstrate a data-driven workflow that integrates pixel-wise spectral deconvolution with machine-learning (ML) to analyze tunneling spectroscopy from FeTe0.55Se0.45, an intrinsic TSC. Based on the local density of states (LDOS) spectra acquired with a millikelvin scanning tunneling microscope under magnetic fields, each spectrum was decomposed into multiple Lorentzian peaks. The extracted peak parameters were assembled into a structured feature set and subsequently embedded and clustered with unsupervised ML algorithms. ML-based clustering identified distinct classes of LDOS spectra, separating superconductor vortices exhibiting ZBPs consistent with established characteristics of MZMs from vortices displaying ZBP-mimicking features of trivial origin. Furthermore, spatially resolved ZBP distributions differentiate isotropic vortex cores with well-defined ZBPs from vortices that exhibit locally distorted ZBPs. By comparing the ZBP distributions to defect locations measured without magnetic field, we found a correlation between local heterogeneity and the ZBP formation, necessitating the systematic, data-driven analysis to disentangle genuine MZM signatures in TSC. This objective and reproducible workflow advances reliable MZM detection in TSCs, providing a foundation for MZM manipulation towards quantum computation.

Title: Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$
Authors: P. Král, V. Sazgari, Yongheng Ge, O. Gerguri, M. Spitaler, J.N. Graham, H. Nakamura, M. Bartkowiak, S. Nakatsuji, H. Luetkens, G. Simutis, Gang Xu, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.

Title: Decoherence of Josephson coupling and thermal quenching of the Josephson diode effect in bilayer superconductors
Authors: F. Yang, C. Y. Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.

Title: Strong-to-weak spontaneous breaking of 1-form symmetry and intrinsically mixed topological order
Authors: Carolyn Zhang, Yichen Xu, Jian-Hao Zhang, Cenke Xu, Zhen Bi, Zhu-Xi Luo
Abstract: Topological orders in 2+1d are spontaneous symmetry-breaking (SSB) phases of 1-form symmetries in pure states. The notion of symmetry is further enriched in the context of mixed states, where a symmetry can be either ``strong" or ``weak". In this work, we apply a Rényi-2 version of the proposed equivalence relation in [Sang, Lessa, Mong, Grover, Wang, & Hsieh, to appear] on density matrices that is slightly finer than two-way channel connectivity. This equivalence relation distinguishes general 1-form strong-to-weak SSB (SW-SSB) states from phases containing pure states, and therefore labels SW-SSB states as ``intrinsically mixed". According to our equivalence relation, two states are equivalent if and only if they are connected to each other by finite Lindbladian evolution that maintains continuously varying, finite Rényi-2 Markov length. We then examine a natural setting for finding such density matrices: disordered ensembles. Specifically, we study the toric code with various types of disorders and show that in each case, the ensemble of ground states corresponding to different disorder realizations form a density matrix with different strong and weak SSB patterns of 1-form symmetries, including SW-SSB. Furthermore we show by perturbative calculations that these disordered ensembles form stable ``phases" in the sense that they exist over a finite parameter range, according to our equivalence relation.

Title: Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots
Authors: Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning that they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of an NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct topological phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a {\it{first order knot transition}} between different knot structures. Unlike the usual knot transition, this transition is not accompanied by an Exceptional point (EP); in contrast, the real and complex parts of the eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian show a discrete jump at the transition point. We emphasize that the choice of an NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is the same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.

Title: Multi-loop and Multi-axis Atomtronic Sagnac Interferometry
Authors: Saurabh Pandey, Ceren Uzun, Katarzyna A. Krzyzanowska, Malcolm G. Boshier
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.

Title: Entanglement growth and information capacity in a quasiperiodic system with a single-particle mobility edge
Authors: Yuqi Qing, Yu-Qin Chen, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the quantum dynamics of a one-dimensional quasiperiodic system featuring a single-particle mobility edge (SPME), described by the generalized Aubry-André (GAA) model. This model offers a unique platform to study the consequences of coexisting localized and extended eigenstates, which contrasts sharply with the abrupt localization transition in the standard Aubry-André model. We analyze the system's response to a quantum quench through two complementary probes: entanglement entropy (EE) and subsystem information capacity (SIC). We find that the SPME induces a smooth crossover in all dynamical signatures. The EE saturation value exhibits a persistent volume-law scaling in the mobility-edge phase, with an entropy density that continuously decreases as the number of available extended states decreases. Complementing this, the SIC profile interpolates between the linear ramp characteristic of extended systems and the information trapping behavior of localized ones, directly visualizing the mixed nature of the underlying spectrum. Our results establish unambiguous dynamical fingerprints of a mobility edge, providing a crucial non-interacting benchmark for understanding information and entanglement dynamics in more complex systems with mixed phases.

Title: Analytical solution of boundary time crystals via the superspin basis
Authors: Dominik Nemeth, Alessandro Principi, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: Boundary time crystals (BTCs) in dissipative collective spin systems have been extensively studied using numerical, mean-field, and perturbative approaches. However, an explicit Liouvillian description governing the long-time dynamics deep within the time crystal phase has remained elusive. Here, we derive an effective Liouvillian that analytically captures the extreme BTC regime, where dissipation is parametrically weak and oscillatory order is maximally robust. By introducing a superspin representation of Liouville space, we obtain closed-form expressions for the Liouvillian eigenvalues to first order in the dissipation strength, providing direct access to decay rates, oscillation frequencies, and their thermodynamic scaling. Applying this framework to the canonical BTC model we analytically recover spontaneous breaking of continuous time-translation symmetry and persistent oscillations in the thermodynamic limit. In contrast, we show that other dissipative spin models exhibit only single-frequency oscillatory dynamics and therefore do not support genuine BTC phases. Our results establish a controlled analytical framework for the long-time dynamics in the extreme BTC regime.

Title: Comment on "Properties and dynamics of generalized squeezed states"
Authors: Rubén Gordillo-Hachuel, Ricardo Puebla
Abstract: A recent article [S. Ashhab and M. Ayyash, New J. Phys. 27, 054104 (2025)] has reported unexpected oscillatory dynamics in generalized squeezed states of order higher than two as their squeezing parameter increases. This behaviour, observed through numerical simulations using truncated bosonic annihilation and creation operators, appeared in several properties of these states, including their average photon number. The authors argued that these oscillations reflect a genuine physical effect. Here, however, we demonstrate that the observed oscillatory behaviour is a consequence of numerical artefacts. A numerical analysis reveals that the oscillations are highly sensitive to the truncation of the Fock basis, indicating a lack of convergence. This is further supported by a theoretical analysis of the Taylor series of the average photon number, suggesting that these generalized squeezed states contain infinite energy after a finite value of the squeezing parameter. Finally, we provide an analytical proof that the average photon number of any generalized squeezed state is a non-decreasing function, thereby ruling out the possibility of intrinsic oscillatory dynamics. We hope these results help clarify the origin of the reported oscillations and highlight the special care required when dealing with high-order squeezing states.

Title: Quasi-continuous sub-$μ$K strontium source without a high-finesse cavity stabilized laser
Authors: Sana Boughdachi, Benedikt Heizenreder, Ananya Sitaram, Erik Dierikx, Yan Xie, Sander Klemann, Paul Klop, Jeroen Koelemeij, Rafał Wilk, Florian Schreck, Andreas Brodschelm
Abstract: We demonstrate a quasi-continuous sub-$\mu$K strontium source achieved without the use of a high-finesse cavity-locked laser. Our frequency reference is based on a dispersion-optimized, fiber-based frequency comb that enables sub-kHz linewidths. The long-term stability of the comb is defined by an external RF reference: either a 10 MHz RF signal from the Dutch Metrology Institute (VSL), or a tunable RF source whose long-term stability is maintained by monitoring and stabilizing the position of a narrow-line magneto-optical trap (MOT). The comb-stabilized system is benchmarked against a conventional cavity-locked laser and achieves comparable performance in broadband and single-frequency MOTs using the narrow $^1$S$_0$ $\rightarrow$ $^3$P$_1$ laser cooling transition. We generate high-flux, sub-$\mu$K samples of all three bosonic strontium isotopes and demonstrate quasi-continuous outcoupling from the MOT. These results highlight the system's suitability for compact, robust, and field-deployable continuous cold atom devices.

Title: Continuous cloud position spectroscopy using a magneto-optical trap
Authors: Benedikt Heizenreder, Ananya Sitaram, Sana Boughdachi, Andrew von Hörsten, Yan Xie, Andreas Brodschelm, Florian Schreck
Abstract: We demonstrate a continuous spectroscopy technique with frequency sensitivity well below the natural transition linewidth, while maintaining a locking range hundreds of times larger. The method exploits the position dependence of a continuous, broadband magneto-optical trap operating on the 7.5 kHz-wide intercombination line of strontium. We show that the frequency sensitivity is fundamentally insensitive to the effective MOT laser linewidth. By applying active feedback on the MOT position to a dispersion-optimized frequency comb, which serves as the reference for stabilizing the MOT laser [1], we achieve a frequency instability below $4.4\times10^{-13}$ after 400 s of averaging in both the optical and radio-frequency domains, surpassing the performance of conventional hot-vapor modulation transfer spectroscopy. Our method is a broadly applicable alternative route to frequency references in the high $10^{-14}$ range around 100 s.

Title: Advancing Universal Deep Learning for Electronic-Structure Hamiltonian Prediction of Materials
Authors: Shi Yin, Zujian Dai, Xinyang Pan, Lixin He
Abstract: Deep learning methods for electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction has offered significant computational efficiency advantages over traditional DFT methods, yet the diversity of atomic types, structural patterns, and the high-dimensional complexity of Hamiltonians pose substantial challenges to the generalization performance. In this work, we contribute on both the methodology and dataset sides to advance universal deep learning paradigm for Hamiltonian prediction. On the method side, we propose NextHAM, a neural E(3)-symmetry and expressive correction method for efficient and generalizable materials electronic-structure Hamiltonian prediction. First, we introduce the zeroth-step Hamiltonians, which can be efficiently constructed by the initial charge density of DFT, as informative descriptors of neural regression model in the input level and initial estimates of the target Hamiltonian in the output level, so that the regression model directly predicts the correction terms to the target ground truths, thereby significantly simplifying the input-output mapping for learning. Second, we present a neural Transformer architecture with strict E(3)-Symmetry and high non-linear expressiveness for Hamiltonian prediction. Third, we propose a novel training objective to ensure the accuracy performance of Hamiltonians in both real space and reciprocal space, preventing error amplification and the occurrence of "ghost states" caused by the large condition number of the overlap matrix. On the dataset side, we curate a high-quality broad-coverage large benchmark, namely Materials-HAM-SOC, comprising 17,000 material structures spanning 68 elements from six rows of the periodic table and explicitly incorporating SOC effects. Experimental results on Materials-HAM-SOC demonstrate that NextHAM achieves excellent accuracy and efficiency in predicting Hamiltonians and band structures.

Title: Quantum Gates via Dynamical Decoupling of Central Qubit on IBMQ and 15NV Center in Diamond
Authors: Lucas Tsunaki, Michael Dotan, Kseniia Volkova, Boris Naydenov
Abstract: We demonstrate a hardware-agnostic protocol for realizing fast, high-fidelity gates through dynamical decoupling (DD) pulse sequences applied to a central qubit coupled to target qubits. The target qubits are controlled by leveraging their intrinsic interaction with the central qubit, eliminating the need for slow, error-prone direct control. We develop and implement the DD-gate protocol within two distinct frameworks: a general model with minimal assumptions, benchmarked on a gate-based digital quantum simulator given by the IBMQ; and an experimentally realistic case with a nitrogen-15 vacancy center ($^{15}$NV) in diamond. Using IBMQ, we are able to elucidate the underlying quantum dynamics of the DD-gates and test them, independently of experimental constraints. For $^{15}$NV, we realize the protocol considering system-specific properties, which could represent a significant reduction in gate duration and improved technological scalability compared with current dynamical-decoupling-based control. We also propose a simple application for high-efficiency polarization of the $^{15}$N nuclear spin that could potentially be less technically demanding than current methods. Altogether, this work provides a robust strategy for quantum control that can be implemented in arbitrary systems fitting the central-target qubit architecture. Beyond these results, our open-source simulations and implementations for both platforms provide a practical framework for simulating time-dependent qubit dynamics on NISQ-era gate-based quantum processors.

Title: Understanding How Synthetic Impurities Affect Glyphosate Solubility and Crystal Growth Using Free Energy Calculations and Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Alejandro Castro, Ignacio Sanchez-Burgos, Nuria H. Espejo, Adiran Garaizar, Giovanni Maria Maggioni, Jorge R. Espinosa
Abstract: Glyphosate, the most widely used herbicide worldwide, crystallizes through complex intermolecular interactions that are strongly influenced by synthesis-derived impurities. Understanding this process at the molecular scale is critical for optimizing production, ensuring product quality, and assessing environmental impact. Here, we employ direct coexistence molecular dynamics simulations and free energy calculations to elucidate how glycine-a prevalent synthesis byproduct-modulates glyphosate solubility and crystal growth in aqueous solutions. Our simulations identify two major mechanisms by which glycine hinders crystallization. First, direct coexistence simulations show that glycine preferentially adsorbs at crystal surfaces, hindering glyphosate attachment and slowing growth. Second, free energy calculations demonstrate that glycine enhances glyphosate solubility, reducing the supersaturation driving force to incorporate into the crystal phase. Experimental measurements corroborate our predictions, confirming both enhanced solubility and reduced crystallization kinetics in glycine-bearing systems. These findings establish that glycine-typically considered an inert impurity-actively disrupts glyphosate crystallization by promoting its dissolution. More broadly, this integrated computational-experimental approach highlights the power of molecular simulations to disentangle impurity effects, interfacial phenomena, and solution thermodynamics in crystallization, providing molecular-level insights for optimizing industrial protocols and predicting agrochemical behavior under relevant environmental conditions.

Title: Self-Assembled hBN Wrinkles as Planar Optofluidic Channels
Authors: Xiliang Yang, Tetsuo Martynowicz, Allard Katan, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Sabina Caneva
Abstract: Optically accessible, scalable planar nanofluidic channels are attractive for studying transport and localization under confinement. Two dimensional (2D) materials provide large area, atomically flat interfaces for generating such platforms, yet achieving long range one-dimensional (1D) confinement with top-down nanofabrication remains challenging because it requires reproducible nanoscale feature control over extended distances, high yield, and low nonspecific adsorption of analytes under aqueous conditions. Here we demonstrate that thermally induced wrinkling of exfoliated hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) produces self-assembled, liquid-accessible, channel-like networks through a lithography-free process. By varying flake thickness and substrate choice, we quantify statistical trends in wrinkle density and morphology, thereby establishing a practical fabrication design space. Atomic force microscopy and electron microscopy reveal wrinkle-derived geometries with vertical confinement ranging from <2 nm to >100 nm depending on flake thickness and substrate. We further employ time-sequence optical imaging upon droplet-contact, which together with Raman mapping of the water OH-stretch band and capacitance-gradient mapping (dC/dz) by scanning dielectric microscopy (KPFM-based) measurements, demonstrates liquid infiltration and long-term liquid retention within the wrinkle network for more than 10 h. We finally show a proof-of-concept biomolecule confinement application in which we integrate a graphene overlayer as a background suppression interface, enabling wide-field fluorescence localization of ATTO647N labeled DNA along hBN wrinkle-induced nanochannels. Overall, this work establishes self-assembled hBN wrinkles as a scalable, and optically addressable planar nanofluidic platform for confinement of fluids and biomolecules.

Title: Many-body symmetry-protected zero boundary modes of synthetic photo-magnonic crystals
Authors: Alan Gardin, Emilio Cobanera, Giuseppe C. Tettamanzi
Abstract: The topological classification of insulators and superconductors, the "ten-fold way", is grounded on fermionic many-body symmetries and has had a dramatic impact on many fields of physics. Therefore, it seems equally important to investigate a similar approach for bosons as tightly analogous to the fermionic prototype as possible. There are, however, several obstacles coming from the fundamental physical differences between fermions and bosons. Here, we propose a theory of free boson topology (topological classification and bulk-boundary correspondence) protected by bosonic many-body symmetry operations, namely, squeezing transformations, particle number, and bosonic time reversal. We identify two symmetry classes that are topologically non-trivial in one dimension. They include key models like the bosonic Kitaev chain, protected by a squeezing symmetry within our framework, and the celebrated bosonic SSH model, protected by a squeezing symmetry and particle number. To provide a robust experimental platform for testing our theory, we introduce a new quantum meta-material: photo-magnonic crystals. They are remarkable for their experimental flexibility and natural affinity for displaying band topological physics at microwave frequencies. We engineer a many-body symmetry-protected topological photo-magnonic chain with boundary modes mandated by a Pfaffian invariant. Using an electromagnetic finite-element modelling, we simulate its reflection and transmission and identify experimental signatures of its boundary modes. The experimental tuning of the crystal to its symmetry-protected topological phase is also addressed. Our modelling of the photo-magnonic chain provides a thorough blueprint for its experimental realisation and the unambiguous observation of its exotic physics.

Title: Haagerup Symmetry in $(E_8)_1$?
Authors: Jan Albert, Yamato Honda, Justin Kaidi, Yunqin Zheng
Abstract: We suggest that the chiral $(\mathfrak{e}_8)_1$ theory -- in many senses the simplest VOA -- may have Haagerup symmetry $\mathcal{H}_i$ for $i=1,2,3$. Likewise, we suggest that the non-chiral $(E_8)_1$ WZW model may have $\mathcal{H}_i \times \mathcal{H}_i^\textrm{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives a $c=8$ theory with $\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{H}_3)$ symmetry, which is the theory predicted in \cite{Evans:2010yr}. Along the way, we show that $(E_8)_1$ also has a $\mathrm{Fib} \times \mathrm{Fib}^\text{op}$ symmetry, and that gauging the diagonal symmetry gives the $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1$ WZW model, explaining the well-known conformal embedding $(G_2)_1 \times (F_4)_1 \subset (E_8)_1$. Finally, we suggest a relation to theories with $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry at $c=2,6$, complimenting the discussion with new modular bootstrap results.

Title: Droplet Breakup Against an Isolated Obstacle
Authors: David J. Meer, Shivnag Sista, Mark D. Shattuck, Corey S. O'Hern, Eric R. Weeks
Abstract: We describe combined experiments and simulations of droplet breakup during flow-driven interactions with a circular obstacle in a quasi-two-dimensional microfluidic chamber. Due to a lack of in-plane confinement, the droplets can also slip past the obstacle without breaking. Droplets are more likely to break when they have a higher flow velocity, larger size (relative to the obstacle radius R), smaller surface tension, and for head-on collisions with the obstacle. We also observe that droplet-obstacle collisions are more likely to result in breakup when the height of the sample chamber is increased. We define a nondimensional breakup number Bk ~ Ca, where Ca is the Capillary number, that accounts for changes in the likelihood of droplet break up with variations in these parameters. As Bk increases, we find in both experiments and discrete element method (DEM) simulations of the deformable particle model that the behavior changes from droplets never breaking (Bk << 1) to always breaking for Bk >> 1, with a rapid change in the probability of droplet breakup near Bk = 1. We also find that Bk ~ S^(4/3), where S characterizes the symmetry of the collision, which implies that the minimum symmetry required for breakup is controlled by a characteristic distance h ~ R.

Title: Higher-Order Corrections to Scrambling Dynamics in Brownian Spin SYK Models
Authors: Tingfei Li, Miao Wang, Jianghui Yu
Abstract: We investigate operator growth in a Brownian spin Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model with random all-to-all interactions, focusing on the full operator-size distribution. For Hamiltonians containing interactions of order two up to $L$, we derive a closed master equation for the Pauli-string expansion coefficients and recast their dynamics into a generating-function formulation suitable for the large-$N$ limit. This approach allows us to diagonalize the leading-order evolution operator explicitly and obtain exact solutions for arbitrary initial operator distributions, including the effects of decoherence. Going beyond leading order, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion that captures higher-order corrections to the operator-size dynamics and the late-time behavior. Our results demonstrate that higher-order effects play a crucial role in operator scrambling and that the full operator-size distribution provides a more refined probe of quantum chaos in Brownian and open quantum systems.

Title: Long-Range Pairing in the Kitaev Model: Krylov Subspace Signatures
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Heiko Georg Menzler
Abstract: Krylov subspace methods quantify operator growth in quantum many-body systems through Lanczos coefficients that encode how operators spread under time evolution. While these diagnostics have been proposed to distinguish quantum chaos from integrability, quadratic fermionic Hamiltonians are widely expected to exhibit trivial Lanczos structure. Here we demonstrate that Lanczos coefficients generated from local boundary operators provide a quantitative diagnostic of whether the lowest excitation gap is controlled by boundary-localized or bulk-extended modes in the long-range Kitaev chain, the model for topological superconductivity with algebraically decaying couplings. We introduce $Krylov$ $staggering$ $parameter$, defined as the logarithmic ratio of consecutive odd and even Lanczos coefficients, whose sign structure correlates robustly with the edge versus bulk character of the gap across the full phase diagram. This correlation arises from a bipartite Krylov structure induced by pairing, power-law couplings, and open boundaries. We derive an exact single-particle operator Lanczos algorithm that reduces the recursion from exponentially large operator space to a finite-dimensional linear problem, achieving machine precision for chains of hundreds of sites. These results establish Krylov diagnostics as operational probes of how low-energy excitations are localized along the chain and how strongly they are tied to the boundaries with broken U(1) symmetry, with potential applications to trapped-ion and cold-atom quantum simulators.

Title: Refined half-integer condition on RG flows
Authors: Ken Kikuchi
Abstract: Renormalization group flows are constrained by symmetries. Traditionally, we have made the most of 't Hooft anomalies associated to the symmetries. The anomaly is mathematically part of the data for the monoidal structure on symmetry categories. The symmetry categories sometimes admit additional structures such as braiding. It was found that the additional structures give further constraints on renormalization group flows. One of these constraints is the half-integer condition. The condition claims the following. Braidings are characterized by conformal dimensions. A symmetry object $c$ in a braided symmetry category surviving all along the flow thus has two conformal dimensions, one in ultraviolet $h_c^\text{UV}$ and the other in infrared $h_c^\text{IR}$. In a renormalization group flow with a renormalization group defect, they add up to a half-integer $h_c^\text{UV}+h_c^\text{IR}\in\frac12\mathbb Z$. We find a necessary condition for the sum to be half-integer. We solve some flows with the refined half-integer condition.

Title: Observing quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved spacetime using programmable quantum processors
Authors: Brendan Rhyno, Bastien Lapierre, Smitha Vishveshwara, Khadijeh Najafi, Ramasubramanian Chitra
Abstract: We digitally simulate quantum many-body dynamics in emergent curved backgrounds using 80 superconducting qubits on IBM Heron processors. By engineering spatially varying couplings in the spin-$\frac12$ XXZ chain, consistent with the low-energy description of the model in terms of an inhomogeneous Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid, we realize excitations that follow geodesics of an effective metric inherited from the underlying spatial deformation. Following quenches from Néel and few-spin-flip states, we observe curved light-cone propagation, horizon-induced freezing in the local magnetization, and position-dependent oscillation frequencies set by the engineered spatial deformation. Despite strong spatial inhomogeneity, unequal-time correlators reveal ballistic quasiparticle propagation in the spin chain. These results establish large-scale digital quantum processors as a flexible platform for detailed and controlled exploration of many-body dynamics in tunable and synthetic curved spacetimes.
