Title: Phonon-assisted tunneling in Jahn-Teller E$ \times $e impurity centers in crystals
Authors: V. Hizhnyakov
Abstract: Tunnel transitions between differently distorted states of impurity centers in crystals with the E$ \times $e Jahn-Teller effect are considered, taking into account the change in phonon dynamics during the transitions. Both linear and quadratic vibronic interactions are taken into account. It was found that the phonon scattering attending tunnelling, leads not only to a broadening of the energy spectrum of the transitions, but also to a deterioration in resonance. This strongly affects the temperature dependence of tunneling. The results obtained are consistent with measurements of ultrasound attenuation of Ni2+ ions in Al2O3 crystal. A notable feature of E$ \times $e tunneling is the existence of a window of values for quadratic vibronic interaction at which its effect disappears, and tunnlling remains coherent at sufficiently high temperatures.

Title: Anisotropic scattering rates in strain-tuned Sr$_2$RuO$_4$
Authors: Ben Currie, David T. S. Perkins, Evgeny Kozik, Joseph J. Betouras, Jörg Schmalian
Abstract: Motivated by recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) experiments, we analyze the temperature, frequency, and momentum dependence of the single-particle scattering rate in a model of the $\gamma$-band of Sr$_2$RuO$_4$ under strain, with particular emphasis on the behavior near the Lifshitz transition where the Fermi energy crosses a single Van Hove point. While the scattering rate is only moderately anisotropic at zero strain, we find that it becomes strongly anisotropic at the Lifshitz point. At the lowest energies, we recover the expected universal behavior: the scattering rate varies (ignoring logarithmic corrections) as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega $ at the Van Hove point and as $\tau^{-1}\sim \omega^{3/2}$ away from it. At higher energies, however, corrections of order $\omega^2$ become important in both regimes. We show that the experimentally observed behavior $\tau^{-1} \sim \omega^{\alpha}$ with $\alpha \approx 1.4(2)$ at the Van Hove point can be quantitatively explained by a superposition of linear and quadratic contributions to the scattering rate, which are comparable in magnitude at the intermediate energies probed by experiment, rather than in terms of a new universal power law. We further predict a distinctive anisotropy, strain dependence, and a non-monotonic frequency dependence of the scattering rate at a Lifshitz transition, all of which may be directly tested in experiments.

Title: How a bilayer Nickelate superconducts: a Quantum Monte Carlo study
Authors: Xu Zhang
Abstract: Using determinant Quantum Monte Carlo, we investigate the interplay between doping, inter-layer tunneling and onsite Hund's coupling in stabilizing superconductivity (SC) in a two-orbital model for the bilayer Nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$. With realistic dispersion and for certain values of the interaction parameters, the auxiliary-field-decoupled fermion Hamiltonian has Kramers anti-unitary symmetries which guarantee the absence of a sign problem. The same anti-unitary symmetries can also be used to show there is a second instability towards $(\pi,\pi)$ exciton condensation in the strong interaction limit. We indicate the possible connection between this exciton order and the enigmatic density wave state observed in experiment, and clarify the decisive role played by the inter-layer tunneling in the competition between SC and exciton condensation. Finally, possible directions on how to enhance the SC transition temperature and stabilize the SC phase are also discussed.

Title: Swimming against a superfluid flow: Self-propulsion via vortex-antivortex shedding in a quantum fluid of light
Authors: Myrann Baker-Rasooli, Tangui Aladjidi, Tiago D. Ferreira, Alberto Bramati, Mathias Albert, Pierre-Élie Larré, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: A superfluid flows without friction below a critical velocity, exhibiting zero drag force on impurities. Above this threshold, superfluidity breaks down, and the internal energy is redistributed into incoherent excitations such as vortices. We demonstrate that a finite-mass, mobile impurity immersed in a flowing two-dimensional paraxial superfluid of light can \textit{swim} against the superfluid current when this critical velocity is exceeded. This self-propulsion is achieved by the periodic emission of quantized vortex-antivortex pairs downstream, which impart an upstream recoil momentum that results in a net propulsive force. Analogous to biological systems that minimize effort by exploiting wake turbulence, the impurity harnesses this vortex backreaction as a passive mechanism of locomotion. Reducing the impurity dynamics to the motion of its center of mass and using a point-vortex model, we quantitatively describe how this mechanism depends on the impurity geometry and the surrounding flow velocity. Our findings establish a fundamental link between internal-energy dissipation in quantum fluids and concepts of self-propulsion in active-matter systems, and opens new possibilities for exploiting vortices for controlled quantum transport at the microscale.

Title: Extreme statistics as a probe of the superfluid to Bose-glass Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition
Authors: Jeanne Colbois, Natalia Chepiga, Shaffique Adam, Gabriel Lemarié, Nicolas Laflorencie
Abstract: Recent studies of delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains have highlighted the role of rare, chain-breaking events that favor localization, in particular for high-energy eigenstates related to many-body localization. In this context, we revisit the random-field XXZ spin-1/2 chain at zero temperature with ferromagnetic interactions, equivalent to interacting fermions or hard-core bosons in a random potential with attractive interactions. We argue that localization in this model can be characterized by chain-breaking events, which are probed by the extreme values of simple local observables, such as the on-site density or the local magnetization, that are readily accessible in both experiments and numerical simulations. Adopting a bosonic language, we study the disorder-induced Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) quantum phase transition from superfluid (SF) to Bose glass (BG), and focus on the strong disorder regime where localization is driven by weak links. Based on high-precision density matrix renormalization group simulations, we numerically show that extreme local densities accurately capture the BKT transition, even for relatively short chains ranging from a few dozen to a hundred sites. We also discuss the SF-BG transition in the weak disorder regime, where finite-size effects pose greater challenges. Overall, our work seeks to establish a solid foundation for using extreme statistics of local observables, such as density, to probe delocalization-localization transitions in disordered quantum chains, both in the ground state and at high energy.

Title: Beyond Ginibre statistics in open Floquet chaotic systems with localized leaks
Authors: Edson M. Signor, Miguel A. Prado Reynoso, Bidhi Vijaywargia, Sandra D. Prado, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: We show that the spectral properties of driven quantum systems with a classically chaotic counterpart and spatially localized openness, such as optical or microwave billiards with leaks, deviate from predictions of Ginibre ensembles. Our analysis focuses on the leaky quantum standard map (QSM) of the kicked rotor. We compare its complex resonance spectrum with both Ginibre and truncated circular orthogonal ensembles (TCOEs). We find that the long-lived resonances follow TCOE statistics, reproducing the density of states and level spacing correlations, but depart from Ginibre predictions. Short-lived resonances, however, do not show a clear correspondence with either random-matrix ensemble. We also demonstrate that increasing the leak size takes the density of states of the TCOE toward the Ginibre limit, yet their spectral correlations remain distinct.

Title: Microscopic Theory Revealing Dual Field-Induced Transitions in Spin-1/2 Screw-Chain Magnets
Authors: Mandev Bhullar, Philip Richard, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: We develop a microscopic theory for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain compounds with spin-orbit coupling that goes beyond the phenomenological site-dependent $g$-tensor description traditionally used for XXZ-like BaCo$_2$V$_2$O$_8$ and related materials. Starting from the symmetry-allowed $JK\Gamma$ Hamiltonian with Heisenberg $J$, Kitaev $K$, and off-diagonal $\Gamma$ interactions, we show that the $\Gamma$ interaction naturally generates the four-sublattice pattern associated with the crystal's screw symmetry. Using the density matrix renormalization group, we identify two distinct field-induced transitions. The first is a continuous transition into an intermediate phase, where the symmetry responsible for the two-fold ground-state degeneracy is broken. The second is a first-order transition into the high-field phase, characterized by a discontinuous jump in the spin-spin correlator. Entanglement-entropy scaling confirms that the first transition belongs to the Ising critical point with the central charge $1/2$. These results establish a microscopic framework for pseudospin-$\frac{1}{2}$ screw-chain systems such as Co$^{2+}$ materials, uncover an intermediate phase whose width increases with $\Gamma$, and provide guidance for systematic exploration of additional field orientations and structural distortions.

Title: On modeling quantum point contacts in quantum Hall systems
Authors: Prasoon Kumar, Kyrylo Snizhko
Abstract: Quantum point contacts (QPC) are a key instrument in investigating the physics of edge excitations in the quantum Hall effect. However, at not-so-high bias voltage values, the predictions of the conventional point QPC model often deviate from the experimental data both in the integer and (more prominently) in the fractional quantum Hall regime. One of the possible explanations for such behaviors is the dependence of the tunneling between the edges on energy, an effect not present in the conventional model. Here we introduce two models that take QPC spatial extension into account: wide-QPC model that accounts for the distance along which the edges are in contact; long-QPC model accounts for the fact that the tunneling amplitude originates from a finite bulk gap and a finite distance between the two edges. We investigate the predictions of these two models in the integer quantum Hall regime for the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude. We find that these two models predict opposite dependences: the amplitude decreasing or increasing away from the Fermi level. We thus elucidate the effect of the QPC geometry on the energy dependence of the tunneling amplitude and investigate its implications for transport observables.

Title: Orbital magnetization from parallel transport of Bloch states
Authors: Johannes Mitscherling, Jan Priessnitz, Libor Šmejkal
Abstract: Quantum geometric formulations of linear and nonlinear responses can be constructed from a single building block in the form of a gauge-invariant interband transition operator. Here, we identify a second building block for quantum geometry: a band-resolved adiabatic connection operator that captures the noncommutativity between band projectors and their momentum derivatives. The band-resolved adiabatic connection operator, first introduced in the theory of adiabatic driving, serves as a generalized angular momentum within the state manifold of single bands, and we employ it to reformulate expressions for the band-resolved orbital magnetic moment. This form provides a complementary geometric interpretation alongside the multiband separation between energetic- and quantum-state properties by the two-state Berry curvature. Our formalism allows us to present formulas valid for both nondegenerate and degenerate bands, thereby removing the limitations of the common Bloch-state formula. We illustrate our theory by calculating a large orbital magnetization emerging without spin-orbit coupling in a spin-compensated, noncoplanar anomalous Hall magnet with degenerate bands.

Title: First-Principles Investigation of Mechanical, Lattice Dynamical, and Thermodynamic Properties of BaTiO3 Polymorphs
Authors: Arpon Chakraborty, M. N. H. Liton, M. S. I. Sarker, M. M. Rahman, M. K. R. Khan
Abstract: BaTiO3 (BTO) is one of the most interesting classes of perovskite materials. The present study has been complied to explore some physical properties such as mechanical, vibrational, thermo-physical, and temperature dependent thermodynamic properties of BaTiO3 polymorphs comprehensively using first principles calculations based on density functional theory (DFT). All the polymorphs are found to be mechanically stable. The polymorphs are elastically anisotropic, machinable and have high hardness and toughness. The cubic phase possesses brittle nature while the other phases show ductile character. The high melting point of the polymorphs reveals that they can be used in tough situations. Also, three of the polymorphs can be used as thermal barrier coating. Moreover, we have also calculated the lattice dynamics and found improved results compared to the available results in the literature. In addition, the temperature and pressure dependent thermodynamic parameters of the polymorphs are evaluated and analyzed for the first time using the quasi-harmonic Debye model. The thermodynamic properties suggested that all phases would be good choices for application in the fields of automobiles, cooling systems, thermal electronic devices, thermal exchangers, and space crafts.

Title: Gate-Tunable Superconducting Spin Valve in a van der Waals Ferromagnet/Superconductor/Ferromagnet Trilayer
Authors: A. S. Ianovskaia, G. A. Bobkov, A. M. Bobkov, I.V. Bobkova
Abstract: We theoretically demonstrate a gate-tunable superconducting spin valve effect (SVE) in a van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure composed of a monolayer superconductor (S) sandwiched between two ferromagnetic (F) monolayers (F/S/F). By electrostatically gating the ferromagnetic layers to modulate their chemical potentials, the system can be continuously tuned between the standard, inverse and triplet (non-monotonic) SVE regimes within the same device. This tunability originates from the gate-controlled hybridization between the superconducting and ferromagnetic electronic spectra, which determines the effective exchange field induced in the S-layer. Furthermore, we reveal that gating enables exotic, non-BCS temperature dependencies of the superconducting order parameter, including reentrant superconductivity, bistable states, first-order phase transitions, and the emergence of superconductivity at finite temperatures. Our results establish vdW F/S/F trilayers as a versatile and highly controllable platform for superconducting spintronics, where external gate voltages can selectively activate different spin-valve functionalities and unconventional superconducting states.

Title: Magnetochiral eigenstate of the Heisenberg chain with spontaneous symmetry breaking
Authors: Tigran A. Sedrakyan, Junjun Pang, Chenan Wei, Baigeng Wang
Abstract: We propose a protocol to construct atypical high-energy eigenstates in quantum systems by using ground states of Hamiltonians deformed by conserved charges. For the spin-1/2 Heisenberg XXX chain we study a chiral Hamiltonian built from the scalar-chirality charge and total magnetization and solve it exactly by Bethe ansatz. Its ground state is a magnetized, current-carrying XXX eigenstate that breaks SU(2), time-reversal, and parity yet stays critical. This zero-entropy macrostate shows ballistic spin and chirality transport and admits realistic cold-atom and Rydberg platforms.

Title: Transport Scaling and Critical Tilt Effects in Disordered 2D Dirac Fermions
Authors: Swadeepan Nanda, Pavan Hosur
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) Dirac fermions occur ubiquitously in condensed matter systems from topological phases to quantum critical points. Since the advent of topological semimetals, where the dispersion is often tilted around the band crossing where the Dirac fermion can appear, tilt has emerged as a key handle that controls physical properties. We study how tilt affects the transport and spectral properties of tilted 2D Dirac fermions under scalar disorder. Although our spectral analyses always show conformity to appropriate Gaussian ensembles, suggestive of delocalization, the conductivity scaling $g(L)$ shows a surprising richness. For a single Dirac node, relevant for quantum Hall transitions and topological insulator surface states, we find $g(L)\sim a_1\log(L)$ with a tilt-dependent coefficient $a_1>0$. Interestingly, when the tilt and transport directions are aligned, $a_1$ and hence $g(L)$ shows a spike at the critical point between the type-I and type-II regimes of the Dirac node. For systems with two Dirac nodes with unbroken time-reversal symmetry, pertinent to quasi-2D Dirac materials, we find $g(L)\sim L^{a_1}(\log L)^{a_2}$. However, we find a surprising tension between tilt along and perpendicular to the transport directions. For the former, $a_1$ changes sign as a function of tilt, hinting at a tilt-driven localization-delocalization transition, while $a_1<0$ for all tilts in the latter case, implying localization. These localized behaviors also reveal tension with the delocalization seen in spectral properties and suggest differing localization tendencies in real and Hilbert spaces. Overall, our work identifies tilt as an essential control parameter that uncovers rich and unconventional transport physics in 2D Dirac materials.

Title: Electronic structure of InP/ZnSe quantum dots: effect of tetrahedral shape, valence band coupling and excitonic interactions
Authors: Josep Planelles, Juan I. Climente
Abstract: The energy levels and optical transitions of tetrahedral core/shell InP/ZnSe quantum dots (QDs) are investigated by means of multi-band k$\cdot$p theory. Despite the $\overline{T}_d$ symmetry relaxing spherical selection rules, the near-band-edge excitonic spectrum is reminiscent of that obtained for spherical nanocrystals. Exceptions appear in large (red-emitting) QDs, where transitions violating the (quasi-)angular momentum selection rule ($\Delta L=0,\pm 2$) are observed, and the ground state does not become dark ($P_{3/2}$-like). Valence band coupling is important in determining the symmetry, degeneracy and energy of hole states, with split-off holes playing a greater role than in CdSe QDs. The ($1S_e$-like) electron ground state exhibits moderate delocalization into the ZnSe shell. The confinement regime is then strong even for thick shells, which results in Coulomb interactions being mostly perturbative. Electrons remain largely localized in the InP core even in negative trions, despite electron-electron repulsions. At the same time, the asymmetry between Coulomb attractions and repulsions leads to negative (positive) trions being bound (antibound) by tens of meV. The biexciton binding energy switches from positive to negative, depending on the QD size.

Abstract: We present a novel multi-stage workflow for computational materials discovery that achieves a 99% success rate in identifying compounds within 100 meV/atom of thermodynamic stability, with a threefold improvement over previous approaches. By combining the Matra-Genoa generative model, Orb-v2 universal machine learning interatomic potential, and ALIGNN graph neural network for energy prediction, we generated 119 million candidate structures and added 1.3 million DFT-validated compounds to the ALEXANDRIA database, including 74 thousand new stable materials. The expanded ALEXANDRIA database now contains 5.8 million structures with 175 thousand compounds on the convex hull. Predicted structural disorder rates (37-43%) match experimental databases, unlike other recent AI-generated datasets. Analysis reveals fundamental patterns in space group distributions, coordination environments, and phase stability networks, including sub-linear scaling of convex hull connectivity. We release the complete dataset, including sAlex25 with 14 million out-of-equilibrium structures containing forces and stresses for training universal force fields. We demonstrate that fine-tuning a GRACE model on this data improves benchmark accuracy. All data, models, and workflows are freely available under Creative Commons licenses.

Title: Symmetry-resolved magnetoelastoresistance in multivalley bismuth
Authors: Suguru Hosoi, Fumu Tachibana, Mai Sakaguchi, Kentaro Ishida, Masaaki Shimozawa, Koichi Izawa, Yuki Fuseya, Yuto Kinoshita, Masashi Tokunaga
Abstract: We report a symmetry-resolved study of longitudinal magnetoelastoresistance (MER) in the multivalley material bismuth, with the current, uniaxial stress, and magnetic field all applied along the binary axis. The magnitude of MER exhibits a steep increase at low magnetic fields, reaches a peak, and then gradually decreases at higher fields. By decomposing the strain response into symmetric and antisymmetric symmetry channels, we reveal contrasting magnetic field dependencies. Despite the overall non-monotonic field dependence of the MER, the symmetric component remains nearly constant under magnetic fields, suggesting that the valleys in bismuth preserve a rigid-band nature against strain even in the presence of a magnetic field. In contrast, the antisymmetric component, associated with mobility anisotropy, dominates the MER response in a magnetic field. At low magnetic fields, the applied field effectively modifies the apparent mobility of each valley, leading to an enhancement in the magnitude of the antisymmetric MER. At higher fields, field-induced valley polarization further modifies this mobility anisotropy by altering the contributions from each valley's mobility, accounting for the moderate suppression of the MER. These findings demonstrate that symmetry-resolved MER serves as a powerful probe of valley-dependent electronic states and provides a fundamental platform for understanding the interplay between magnetic field, strain, and charge transport.

Title: Trion Formation Hampers Single Quantum Dot Performance in Silane-Coated FAPbBr3 Quantum Dots
Authors: Jessica Kline, Shaoni Kar, Benjamin F. Hammel, Yunping Huang, Zixu Huang, Seth R. Marder, Sadegh Yazdi, Gordana Dukovic, Bernard Wenger, Henry Snaith, David S. Ginger
Abstract: We explore silane-coated formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr3) quantum dots as single photon emitters and compare them to FAPbBr3 quantum dots passivated with a phosphoethylammonium derivative (PEAC8C12), which represents current state-of-the-art in zwitterionic molecular surface ligand passivation. We compare properties including single-photon purity (g2(t)), linewidth, blinking, and photostability. We find that at room temperature, these silane-coated dots perform comparably to the PEAC8C12 passivation in terms of single-photon performance metrics, while exhibiting improvements in photostability. However, we find that at 4K, silane-coated FAPbBr3 quantum dots perform worse than the PEAC8C12-passivated samples, exhibiting faster blue-shifting and photobleaching under illumination. Analysis of fluorescence lifetime intensity distributions from the photon-counting data indicates increased efficiency of fast non-radiative processes in the silane-coated quantum dots at 4K. We propose a trion related degradation pathway at low temperatures that is consistent with the observed kinetics and estimate that at 4K with 6.1 uJ/cm2, 472 nm excitation the silane-coated quantum dots build up double the trion population of their PEAC8C12-passivated counterparts.

Title: Skyrmion Sliding Switch in a 90-nm-Wide Nanostructured Chiral Magnet
Authors: Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Weiwei Wang, Lingyao Kong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Jin Tang
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, renowned for their fascinating electromagnetic properties, hold potential for next-generation topological spintronic devices. Recent advancements have unveiled a rich tapestry of 3D topological magnetism. Nevertheless, the practical application of 3D topological magnetism in the development of topological spintronic devices remains a challenge. Here, we showcase the experimental utilization of 3D topological magnetism through the exploitation of skyrmion-edge attractive interactions in 90-nm-wide confined chiral FeGe and CoZnMn magnetic nanostructures. These attractive interactions result in two degenerate equilibrium positions, which can be naturally interpreted as binary bits for a skyrmion sliding switch. Our theory and simulation reveal current-driven spiral motions of skyrmions, governed by the anisotropic gradient of the potential landscape. Our experiments validate the theory that predicts a tunable threshold current density via magnetic field and temperature modulation of the energy barrier. Our results offer an approach for implementing universal on-off switch functions in 3D topological spintronic devices.

Title: Current-controlled creations, deletions, and topological transformations of a single magnetic antiskyrmion in nanostructured cells
Authors: Yaodong Wu, Jialiang Jiang, Lingyao Kong, Wei Liu, Huanhuan Zhang, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du, Jin Tang
Abstract: Topological magnetic solitons have emerged as promising candidates for information carriers in spintronic devices, thanks to their fascinating electromagnetic properties. For fundamental device applications, the ability to electrically manipulate individual solitons is crucial. However, electrical manipulation of single antiskyrmions has been rarely demonstrated. In this work, we present current-controlled manipulations, encompassing the creation, deletion, and topological transformation of a single antiskyrmion within FeNiPdP nanostructured cells at room temperature. This nanostructure is uniquely designed with dimensions of about 400 nm in width and length, enabling the stabilization of a single antiskyrmion. By simply adjusting the density of nanosecond single-pulsed currents, we achieve the reversible creation and deletion of single antiskyrmions. Moreover, we uncover a rich variety of current-controlled topological transformations among individual antiskyrmions, skyrmions, bubbles, and ferromagnetic states. Our experimental findings are corroborated by micromagnetic simulations, highlighting the pivotal role of current-induced combined effects, such as spin transfer torque and Joule heating. Our results hold potential for advancing antiskyrmion-based device applications.

Title: Creating and Deleting a Single Dipolar Skyrmion by Surface Spin Twists
Authors: Jin Tang, Jialiang Jiang, Yaodong Wu, Lingyao Kong, Yihao Wang, Junbo Li, Y. Soh, Yimin Xiong, Shouguo Wang, Mingliang Tian, Haifeng Du
Abstract: We report deterministic operations on single dipolar skyrmions confined in nanostructured cuboids using in-plane currents. We achieve highly reversible writing and deleting of skyrmions in the simple cuboid without any artificial defects or pinning sites. The current-induced creation of skyrmions is well-understood through the spin-transfer torque acting on surface spin twists of the spontaneous 3D ferromagnetic state, caused by the magnetic dipole-dipole interaction of the uniaxial Fe3Sn2 magnet with a low-quality factor. Current-induced deletions of skyrmions result from the combined effects of magnetic hysteresis and Joule thermal heating. Our results are replicated consistently through 3D micromagnetic simulations. Our approach offers a viable method for achieving reliable single-bit operations in skyrmionic devices for applications such as random-access memories.

Title: Predicting tunable nonreciprocal spin wave generation mediated by interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in magnonic heterostructures
Authors: Cameron A McEleney, Karen L Livesey, Robert E Camley, Rair Macêdo
Abstract: Thin, metallic magnetic films can support nonreciprocal spin waves due to the interfacial Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (iDMI). However, these films typically have high damping, making spin wave propagation distances short (less than one micrometer). In this work, we theoretically study a thin ferromagnetic strip with iDMI and excite spin waves by driving a central segment of the strip. Spin waves propagate with different amplitudes to the left versus to the right from the driving region (i.e. nonreciprocity occurs) due to the iDMI. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion plus our micromagnetic simulations both show that changing the driving segment width, driving frequency and static applied field strength tunes the nonreciprocity. Our calculation based on spin-wave-dispersion, using a so-called "overlap function" will allow researchers to predict conditions of maximum nonreciprocity, without the need for computational solvers. Moreover, to circumvent the issue of short propagation distances, we propose a geometry where iDMI is only present in the driving region and low-damping materials comprise the remainder of the strip. Our calculations show significant spin wave amplitudes over several microns from the excitation region.

Title: Auto-3DPFM: Automating Polarization-Vector Mapping at the Nanoscale
Authors: Ralph Bulanadi, Marti Checa, Michelle Wang, Franck Rothen, John Lasseter, Sumner B. Harris, Daniel Sando, Valanoor Nagarajan, Liam Collins, Stephen Jesse, Rama Vasudevan, Yongtao Liu
Abstract: The functional properties of ferroelectric materials are strongly influenced by ferroelectric polarization orientation; as such, access to consistent and precise characterization of polarization vectors is of substantial importance to ferroelectrics research. Here, we develop a fully automated three-dimensional piezoresponse force microscopy (Auto-3DPFM) technique automating all essential steps in interferometric PFM for 3D polarization vector characterization, including laser alignment, tip calibration and approach, image acquisition, polarization vector reconstruction, and visualization. The automation reduces the experimental burden of ferroelectric polarization vector characterization, while the back-and-forth calibration ensures consistency and reproducibility of 3D polarization reconstruction. An algorithmic workflow is also developed to identify domain walls and calculate their characteristic angles via a spatial vector-angle-difference method, presenting one unique capability enabled by Auto-3DPFM that is not accessible with traditional PFM techniques. Beyond representing a significant step forward in 3D polarization mapping, Auto-3DPFM promises to accelerate discovery via high-throughput and autonomous characterization in ferroelectric materials research. When integrated with machine learning and adaptive sampling strategies in self-driving labs, Auto-3DPFM will serve as a valuable tool for advancing ferroelectric physics and microelectronics development.

Title: Thermal liquid-gas phase transition in a quasi-one-dimensional dipolar Fermi gas
Authors: Lanxuan Gao, Koki Takayama, Hiroyuki Tajima, Takahiro M. Doi, Haozhao Liang
Abstract: We theoretically investigate thermodynamic properties in a quasi-one-dimensional single-component dipolar Fermi gas at finite temperatures. The self-bound fermionic droplet can be achieved by exchange correlations with the long-range dipole-dipole interactions under the quasi-one-dimensional confinement, where the interaction can be tuned by tilting the dipoles along the system coordinate. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we show how the liquid-gas phase transition occurs in this system, and elucidate the finite-temperature phase structure consisting of the gas phase, liquid phase, their coexistence, and the spinodal phase. We also discuss its similarity with the liquid-gas phase transition in nuclear matter through the comparison with phenomenological models. Our results would be useful for an interdisciplinary understanding of self-bound fermionic matter as well as an analog quantum simulation of nuclear systems.

Title: Observation of ubiquitous charge correlations and hidden quantum critical point in hole-doped kagome superconductors
Authors: Ilija K. Nikolov, Giuseppe Allodi, Adrien Rosuel, Ginevra Corsale, Anshu Kataria, Pietro Bonfà, Roberto De Renzi, Andrea Capa Salinas, Stephen D. Wilson, Marc-Henri Julien, Samuele Sanna, Vesna F. Mitrović
Abstract: The interplay between superconductivity and charge-density wave (CDW) order, and its evolution with carrier density, is central to the physics of many quantum materials, notably high-$T_c$ cuprates and kagome metals. Hole-doped kagome compounds exhibit puzzling double-dome superconductivity and, as chemical substitution inevitably introduces quenched disorder, their properties remain poorly understood. Here, by leveraging the sensitivity of nuclear quadrupole resonance to local and static orderings, we uncover new features, primarily the incipient and fragmented CDW phases, in the charge landscape of CsV$_3$Sb$_{5-x}$Sn$_x$. Static CDW puddles are observed well above the transition temperature, a hallmark of pinning by defects. Their doping and temperature evolution indicate that, in the absence of disorder, the inverse Star-of-David $\pi$-shifted (ISD-$\pi$) CDW order would vanish near $x=0.12$, between the two superconducting domes. This critical doping represents a hidden quantum critical point. Nevertheless, the ISD-$\pi$ pattern persists well beyond previous reports, although its volume fraction is progressively reduced up to the critical doping at which it saturates. We establish that carrier doping promotes fragmentation of the ISD-$\pi$ order, whereas randomness preserves the ISD-$\pi$ patches.

Title: A physics-augmented neural network framework for modeling and detecting thermo-visco-plastic behavior
Authors: Reese E. Jones, Asghar Jadoon, D. Thomas Seidl, Jan N. Fuhg
Abstract: Although considerable attention has been devoted to the development of models for isothermal, rate-independent plasticity, many high-consequence performance assessments involve viscoplastic processes that generate substantial heat. In addition, materials may transit from a nearly isothermal, rate-independent regime to a viscous, temperature-dependent regime during these processes, which makes modeling more challenging. In this work, we develop a physics-augmented neural network (PANN) framework for modeling general temperature-dependent, rate-dependent inelastic processes firmly based on physical principles, including the second law of thermodynamics and coordinate equivariance. These embedded properties are enabled by a number of architectural innovations in the structure and training of an input convex and potential-based neural ordinary differential equation framework. The resulting neural network models are capable of representing a wide spectrum of rate- and temperature-dependence ranging from isothermal, rate-independent elastic-plastic phenomenology to rate-dependent fully viscous inelastic behavior, as we demonstrate. We also show that the framework is capable of modeling complex microstructural inelasticity and predicting the conversion of plastic work to heating when calibrated to stress-temperature observations.

Abstract: Solid-phase epitaxy (SPE) of beta-Ga2O3 thin films by radio-frequency (RF) sputtering and then crystallized through high-temperature post-deposition annealing is employed on sapphire substrates, yielding a high-quality pseudo-substrate for subsequent buffer growth via MOCVD and LPCVD. Low roughness (<0.5 nm) and sharp single-crystalline diffraction peaks corresponding to the (-201), (-402), and (-603) reflections of beta-Ga2O3 were observed in the SPE beta-Ga2O3 film and the subsequent epitaxial buffer layer. N-doped Ga2O3 film on SPE Ga2O3 film grown by LPCVD showed step-assisted growth mode with reasonable electronic behavior with 45 cm^2/V-s mobility at a bulk carrier concentration of 1.3e17 cm^-3. These results suggest that SPE Ga2O3 is a promising pathway to advance the development of beta-Ga2O3 on foreign substrates.

Title: Modified Kondorsky Domain Reversal in Microstructured Phase-Separated Manganites
Authors: Monique Kubovsky, Dylan Tagrin, Amlan Biswas
Abstract: The hole-doped manganite (La$_{1-y}$Pr$_{y}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_3$ (LPCMO) shows electronic phase separation between ferromagnetic metallic (FMM) and anti-ferromagnetic charge-ordered insulating (AFM-COI) regions. In this study, (La$_{0.5}$Pr$_{0.5}$)$_{0.67}$Ca$_{0.33}$MnO$_{3}$ (LP5CMO) microstructures were fabricated using photolithography on thin films grown on (110) NdGaO$_3$ (NGO) substrates. We investigated the domain reversal mechanism of these microstructures through magnetotransport measurements. Our results demonstrate that, while bulk (unpatterned) films follow the standard Kondorsky model for domain reversal, the microstructures obey a modified Kondorsky model. This difference indicates that local magnetic fields from reversed domains significantly influence the coercive field in confined geometries. Although we did not observe a strong electric field effect, this study establishes that magnetotransport measurements are a feasible method for probing the competition between shape and magnetocrystalline anisotropy in manganite microstructures, which could provide an alternative path for controlling magnetic domains at low current densities.

Title: Bulk superconductivity in the kagome metal YRu3B2
Authors: Tobi Gaggl, Ryo Misawa, Markus Kriener, Yuki Tanaka, Rinsuke Yamada, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: Materials with a kagome sublattice have been heavily studied recently for their exotic electronic band structure, structural frustration, high-temperature charge order transitions, and unconventional electron-phonon coupling. In LaRu3Si2, it was proposed that electronic flat bands conspire with the characteristic phonon spectrum of the kagome lattice to drive enhanced superconductivity at Tc = 7 K. Here, we report bulk superconductivity in the structural analogue YRu3B2, which hosts a structurally pristine kagome lattice. We observe a superconducting transition at Tc = 0.7 K through magnetization, resistivity, and heat-capacity measurements in this novel kagome metal.

Title: Low-dimensionality-induced tunable ferromagnetism in SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin films
Authors: Jinyoung Kim, Minjae Kim, Donghan Kim, Sungsoo Hahn, Younsik Kim, Minsoo Kim, Byungmin Sohn, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: Quantum materials near electronic or magnetic phase boundaries exhibit enhanced tunability, as their emergent properties become highly sensitive to external perturbations. Here, we demonstrate precise control of ferromagnetism in a SrRuO$_3$ ultrathin film, where a high density of states (DOS), arising from low-dimensional quantum states, places the system at the crossover between a non-magnetic and bulk ferromagnetic state. Using spin- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (SRPES/ARPES), transport measurements, and theoretical calculations, we systematically tune the Fermi level via electron doping across the high-DOS point. We directly visualize the spin-split band structure and reveal its influence on both magnetic and transport properties. Our findings provide compelling evidence that magnetism can be engineered through DOS control at a phase crossover, establishing a pathway for the rational design of tunable quantum materials.

Title: Translating Chirality into Multidirectional Motion through Broadband Chiroptical MXenes
Authors: Wookjin Jung, Dongkyu Lee, Yonghee Lee, Ki Hyun Park, Jihyeon Yeom
Abstract: The integration of chirality into functional materials enables control of light-matter interactions beyond binary illumination (on/off). Conventional photoactuators rely on binary modulation, limiting them to unidirectional motion. In contrast, we introduce a ternary optical logic paradigm where actuation direction is encoded by the handedness of circularly polarized light (CPL). Here, we establish a chiral Ti$_{3}$C$_{2}$T$_{x}$ MXene platform bridging molecular chirality and mechanical actuation. Phenylalanine enantiomers are covalently anchored onto MXene nanoflakes via chiral nanopainting. The 2D confinement forces ligands into vertically aligned supramolecular networks. Interlayer-spacing analysis and simulations corroborate that such supramolecular networks unlock exceptionally broadband circular dichroism from the ultraviolet to the near-infrared. This supramolecular chirality synergizes with MXene's plasmonic properties to drive handedness-dependent photothermal conversion, with a 30\% differential temperature rise between matched and mismatched CPL. Embedding this chiral MXene into thermoresponsive hydrogels realizes, to the best of our knowledge, the first CPL-driven soft actuator that implements LCP/RCP/off as a ternary input to program multidirectional deformation based on a photothermal mechanism. This molecular-to-macroscopic translation demonstrates a new paradigm for chirality-encoded soft robotics and adaptive photonics.

Title: Electrical Characterization of High-k (k>115) Crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) thin film integration with GaN with Nanomembrane Transfer Process
Authors: Md Tahmidul Alam, Kyoungjun Lee, Guangying Wang, Chang-beom Eom, Chirag Gupta
Abstract: High-k (115), crystalline SrTiO3 (STO) thin film was transferred on GaN for potential applications in power devices (transistor and diodes) by nanomembrane transfer method and the detailed electrical properties such as leakage current, CV profiles, dielectric constant, frequency dispersion was reported from fabricated MOSCAP structures. The leakage current was negligible (under noise-level of tool) up to 6 V and 11 V for 50 nm and 200 nm STO membrane respectively A high-quality dielectric was indicated by the CV profile, which showed almost negligible frequency dispersion in the frequency range of 10 kHz to 500 kHz. The dielectric constant was 50 to 82 with the 50 nm thick STO membrane and 115 to 186 in the 200 nm thick STO membrane. Thermal annealing of the membrane in ambient conditions at 250 degrees for 2 hours led to a slight improvement in the dielectric constant (8 to 20 percent), albeit at the expense of degraded leakage current performance, as indicated by a reduction of 1 V to 3 V in the "no leakage region" of the IV curves after annealing. The possible physical mechanisms responsible for these changes were also analyzed and discussed.

Title: Exact Screening-Ranged Expansions for Many-Body Electrostatics
Authors: Sergii V. Siryk, Walter Rocchia
Abstract: We present an exact many-body framework for electrostatic interactions among $N$ arbitrarily charged spheres in an electrolyte, modeled by the linearized Poisson--Boltzmann equation. Building on a spectral analysis of nonstandard Neumann--Poincaré-type operators introduced in a companion mathematical work~\cite{supplem_pre_math}, we construct convergent screening-ranged series for the potential, interaction energy, and forces, where each term is associated with a well-defined Debye--Hückel screening order and can be obtained evaluating an analytical expression rather than numerically solving an infinitely dimensional linear system. This formulation unifies and extends classical and recent approaches, providing a rigorous basis for electrostatic interactions among heterogeneously charged particles (including Janus colloids) and yielding many-body generalizations of analytical closed-form results previously available only for two-body systems. The framework captures and clarifies complex effects such as asymmetric dielectric screening, opposite-charge repulsion, and like-charge attraction, which remain largely analytically elusive in existing treatments. Beyond its fundamental significance, the method leads to numerically efficient schemes, offering a versatile tool for modeling colloids and soft/biological matter in electrolytic solution.

Title: Symmetry-driven giant magneto-optical Kerr effects in altermagnet hematite
Authors: Jiaxin Luo, Xiaodong Zhou, Jinxuan Liang, Ledong Wang, Qiuyun Zhou, Yong Jiang, Wenhong Wang, Yugui Yao, Luyi Yang, Wanjun Jiang
Abstract: Altermagnets have attracted tremendous interest for revealing intriguing physics and promising spintronics applications. In contrast to conventional antiferromagnets, altermagnets break both PT and Tt symmetries, and simultaneously exhibit spin-split band structures with a vanishing net magnetization. To quantify insulating altermagnets without conduction electron, we propose to use magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE) to identify the altermagnetic fingerprints. In particular, we demonstrate not only the giant MOKE responses, but also their connection with the orientations of Neel vectors at room temperature in altermagnet hematite alpha-Fe_2O_3. Specifically, under the Neel vector along the [1-100] axis, we find a giant polar Kerr rotation angle 93.4 mdeg in the (11-20) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2'/c'. Under the Neel vector along the [11-20] axis, we find a longitudinal Kerr angle 9.6 mdeg in the (0001) plane, which is allowed by the magnetic space group C2/c. Further, we show that such pronounced MOKE effects directly enable an optical imaging of altermagnetic domains, together with their reversible domain wall (DW) motion. Our studies not only suggest MOKE can be used to identify altermagnet candidates, but also signify the feasibility of exploring altermagnetic optical and DW spintronics, which could largely expand the current research paradigm of altermagnetism.

Title: Twin Domains in 111 oriented {CdO/MgO} superlattices: homoepitaxy versus heteroepitaxy
Authors: Ewa Przeździecka, Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Abinash Adhikari, Marta A. Chabowska
Abstract: The structural properties of (111)-oriented {CdO/MgO} superlattice structures grown on c-sapphire and cubic MgO substrates have been studied by high resolution X-ray diffraction. The growth was performed in a plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy system. Although both superlattices are (111)-oriented and the {CdO/MgO} structure has 3m symmetry. It was shown that the superlattice on c-sapphire consists of misoriented domains, whereas no such domains were observed on (111) MgO. The twin domains are rotated by 180° with respect to each other and by 30° with respect to the sapphire substrate. We show that the crucial phenomena based on the formation of rotation domains and their number in heteroepitaxy depend fundamentally on the relationship between substrate and epilayer symmetries.

Title: A First Look at Hydrogen Generation in an Ultramafic Rock with Micro-CT and SEM-BEX
Authors: Hannah P. Menke, Zaid Z. Jangda, Max Webb, Jim Buckman, Amy Gough
Abstract: Natural hydrogen generated by water-rock interaction in ultramafic rocks is increasingly recognised as a potentially important primary energy resource, but the pore-scale processes that control the initiation and early transport of a free gas phase remain poorly constrained. Here we present an in situ X-ray micro-tomography experiment in which an ultramafic granular pack of dunnite from West Papua, Indonesia, saturated with KI-doped brine, is heated to 100C with a pore pressure of 4bar under 10bar confining pressure inside a micro-CT scanner. Time-resolved 4D imaging captures the transition from a fully liquid-saturated pore space to the appearance and growth of a distinct gas phase after an 8h induction period. Bubbles first nucleate near the top of the sample before becoming distributed throughout the imaged volume as a connected ganglia. The nucleating gas phase is most plausibly dominated by molecular hydrogen generated by low-temperature fluid-rock reaction, as indicated by independent hydrogen-presence detectors, although we cannot yet fully exclude minor contributions from other gases. SEM-BEX imaging reveals textural alteration and local changes in elemental signals between reacted and unreacted material. Taken together, these observations provide spatially and temporally resolved evidence for gas generation during low-temperature alteration of ultramafic grains and demonstrate that pore-scale imaging can directly link water-rock reaction kinetics, gas generation and multiphase flow behaviour in natural hydrogen systems.

Title: Modeling the dynamics of trapped electrons in quantum dots
Authors: R. Carmina Monreal
Abstract: We analyze the effects of electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions in the dynamics of a system of two or three electrons that can be trapped to a localized state and detrapped to ab extended band states of a quantum dot using a simple model. In spite of its simplicity the time dependent problem has no analytical solution but a numerically exact one can be found at a relatively low computational cost. Within this model, we study the time evolution of the electron occupancies of conduction and valence bands and the trap state, as well as the statistical factors influencing light emission of different energies. In most of the analyzed cases, the system dynamics has a very short transient determined by the hopping parameters, that can be of tens of femptoseconds,followed by a quasi-stationary regime in which the electron occupancies either oscillate periodically around their time-averaged values or remain nearly constant. We find signatures of strong electronic correlations in the electronic motion for negative values of the effective electron-electron Coulomb interaction that are not translated to the statistical factors for light emission. Our calculations show that light emission of different energies is always possible except in the especial cases in which the valence band is initially filled with two electrons. In these cases the valence band can lose and recover electrons periodically but exciton emission is negligible at any time. We use this fact to attempt to give a possible explanation for the increase in the intensity of exciton emission with the concomitant decrease in the intensity of the green emission lines upon continuous illumination with ultraviolet radiation, experimentally observed for ZnO nanoparticles suspended in an alcohol.

Title: Modeling Complex Multiphysics Systems with Discrete Element Method Enriched with the Kernel-Independent Fast Multipole Method
Authors: Igor A. Ostanin
Abstract: The paper describes the coupling of the MercuryDPM discrete element method (DEM) code and the implementation of the kernel-independent fast multipole method (KIFMM). The combined simulation framework allows addressing the large class of multiscale problems, including both the mechanical interactions of particulates at the fine scale and the long-range interactions of various natures at the coarse scale. Among these are electrostatic interactions in powders, clays, and particulates, magnetic interactions in ferromagnetic granulates, and gravitational interactions in asteroid clouds. The formalism of rigid clumps is successfully combined with KIFMM, enabling addressing problems involving complex long-large interactions between non-spherical particles with arbitrary charge distributions. The capabilities of our technique are demonstrated in several application examples.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking on graphs and lattices
Authors: Oleg Evnin
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking is a cornerstone modern physics, defining a wealth of phenomena in condensed-matter and high-energy physics, and beyond. It requires an infinite number of degrees of freedom, and even then, for continuous symmetries, it only works if the spatial dimension is not too low, following the classic results of Coleman, Hohenberg, Mermin and Wagner. While usually discussed in the context of quantum and statistical field theories, and in particular, effective field theories, there are advantages in addressing the same kind of phenomena on discrete geometric structures rather than conventional manifolds. When the space is discretized into a lattice, a lucid picture of conventional spontaneous symmetry breaking springs up, with the ultraviolet issues of continuum quantum field theory out-of-sight, and the key effect, which is infrared in nature, revealed through elementary harmonic oscillator networks. From there, it is natural to generalize lattices to other graphs/networks. In this setting, the presence of spontaneous symmetry breaking is controlled by fractional generalizations of resistance distance and the Kirchhoff index, and most broadly by the spectral dimension. Predictably, because of richness of discrete geometric structures in comparison with continuous manifolds, a broader array of geometries emerge where spontaneous breaking of continuous symmetries is blocked by large fluctuations.

Title: Transport properties and thermopower of the spinful Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev dot
Authors: Marco Uguccioni, Daniele Morotti, Luca Dell'Anna
Abstract: We study the electric and thermoelectric transport through a spinful complex Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) quantum dot coupled to metallic leads, forming a N-SYK-N junction, by the Keldysh field theory approach. Unlike traditional equilibrium approaches, our formulation treats the system as an open, interacting quantum conductor under non-equilibrium conditions, without resorting to the replica trick. Starting from the exact Keldysh-Dyson equations, we derive analytical results for the tunneling and zero-temperature limits and perform a numerical analysis in the linear-response regime. We characterize the dependence of conductance, thermoelectric coefficient, and Seebeck effect on the particle-hole asymmetry parameter and coupling strength to the leads. Our results reveal distinctive non-Fermi liquid signatures of the SYK model in transport properties and identify coupling regimes where thermoelectric effects are enhanced, suggesting experimentally accessible fingerprints of SYK physics in mesoscopic systems.

Title: Breaking the Logarithmic Barrier: Activity-Induced Recovery of Phase Separation Dynamics in Confined Geometry
Authors: Preethi M, Parameshwaran A, Bhaskar Sen Gupta
Abstract: Phase separation in confined environments is a fundamental process underlying geological flows, porous filtration, emulsions, and intracellular organization. Yet, how confinement and activity jointly govern coarsening kinetics and interfacial morphology remains poorly understood. Here, we use large-scale molecular dynamics simulations to investigate vapor-liquid phase separation of passive and active fluids embedded in complex porous media. By generating porous host structures via a freeze-quench protocol, we systematically control the average pore size and demonstrate that confinement induces a crossover from the Lifshitz-Slyozov power-law growth to logarithmically slowed coarsening, ultimately arresting domain evolution. Analysis of correlation functions and structure factors reveals that confined passive systems exhibit fractal interfaces, violating Porod's law and indicating rough morphological arrest. In contrast, introducing self-propulsion dramatically changes the coarsening pathway: activity restores smooth interfaces, breaks the confinement-induced scaling laws, and drives a transition from logarithmic to ballistic domain growth at high activity levels. Our findings reveal an activity-controlled mechanism to overcome geometric restrictions and unlock coarsening in structurally heterogeneous environments. These insights establish a unifying framework for nonequilibrium phase transitions in porous settings, with broad relevance to active colloids, catalytic media, and biologically crowded systems, where living matter routinely reorganizes within geometric constraints to sustain function.

Title: Transport Novelty Distance: A Distributional Metric for Evaluating Material Generative Models
Authors: Paul Hagemann, Simon Müller, Janine George, Philipp Benner
Abstract: Recent advances in generative machine learning have opened new possibilities for the discovery and design of novel materials. However, as these models become more sophisticated, the need for rigorous and meaningful evaluation metrics has grown. Existing evaluation approaches often fail to capture both the quality and novelty of generated structures, limiting our ability to assess true generative performance. In this paper, we introduce the Transport Novelty Distance (TNovD) to judge generative models used for materials discovery jointly by the quality and novelty of the generated materials. Based on ideas from Optimal Transport theory, TNovD uses a coupling between the features of the training and generated sets, which is refined into a quality and memorization regime by a threshold. The features are generated from crystal structures using a graph neural network that is trained to distinguish between materials, their augmented counterparts, and differently sized supercells using contrastive learning. We evaluate our proposed metric on typical toy experiments relevant for crystal structure prediction, including memorization, noise injection and lattice deformations. Additionally, we validate the TNovD on the MP20 validation set and the WBM substitution dataset, demonstrating that it is capable of detecting both memorized and low-quality material data. We also benchmark the performance of several popular material generative models. While introduced for materials, our TNovD framework is domain-agnostic and can be adapted for other areas, such as images and molecules.

Title: Controlling Skyrmion Lattices via Strain: Elongation, Tilting, and Collapse Mechanisms
Authors: Haijun Zhao, Tae-Hoon Kim, Lin Zhou, Liqin Ke
Abstract: This study establishes a comprehensive framework for the three-dimensional strain control of magnetic skyrmion strings. We integrate analytical modeling, micromagnetic simulations, and \textit{in situ} Lorentz transmission electron microscopy experiments to demonstrate that externally applied strain is a powerful stimuli for manipulating three-dimensional magnetic skyrmion strings. Analytical models predict that strain induces both elongation and bidirectional tilting of skyrmion strings in bulk systems, a finding corroborated by numerical simulations. These simulations further reveal that strain drives the system from fragmented multi-domain states toward unified single-domain configurations and facilitates skyrmion string rupture via bobber formation at critical strain levels. The collapse of the skyrmion lattice exhibits a temperature-dependent character, shifting from first-order to second-order behavior near the critical temperature $T_c$. Reducing sample thickness significantly increases the critical strain required for annihilation due to the suppression of tilting. Experimental validation on a $\text{Co}_8\text{Zn}_{8.5}\text{Mn}_{3.5}$ sample confirms strain-induced elongation and subsequent collapse into a conical phase via anti-cluster formation, directly implicating strain-modulated Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) as the primary mechanism in this system, over magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These findings provide a mechanistic understanding of strain-mediated control in three-dimensional magnetic systems, demonstrating its feasibility for energy-efficient spintronic applications.

Title: Single particle dynamical signature of topology induced by single mode cavities in Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain
Authors: Fabrizio Pavan, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: Witnessing and tracking topological phase transitions induced by interactions with the environment is a crucial challenge. Among the various experimental approaches to detect topological properties, the Mean Chiral Displacement (MCD) has emerged as a powerful bulk probe in one-dimensional chiral systems, allowing the extraction of the topological invariant from single-particle dynamics. Here we study the dynamics of a single particle in a one-dimensional Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain coupled to multiple cavity modes via inter-cell hopping terms, focusing on the out-of-equilibrium behavior of the MCD. We show that, whenever the frequency is larger than the static hopping amplitudes, the coupling induces a discontinuous jump in the MCD, already at small times, signaling that such a coupling also leaves a signature in the survival edge probability when the dynamics are initialized at one of the two edges. For frequencies comparable to the static hopping amplitudes, topological order competes with dissipative effects, which makes the MCD behave smoothly, retaining information about the driven-dissipative topology.

Title: Influence of strong electron irradiation on fluctuation conductivity and pseudogap in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$δ$ single crystals
Authors: A. L. Solovjov, K. Rogacki, N. V. Shytov, E. V. Petrenko, L. V. Bludova, A. Chroneos, R. V. Vovk
Abstract: The effect of high-energy electron irradiation on the temperature dependences of the resistivity $\rho(T)$, fluctuation conductivity (FLC), and pseudogap (PG) $\Delta^{*}(T)$ of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$\delta$ (YBCO) single crystals without twins was studied. Irradiation causes a linear increase in $\rho(T)$ and a decrease in the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ with dose $\phi$. For small $\phi$, the reduction of $T_c$ follows the Abrikosov--Gorkov (AG) pair-breaking theory, while for large $\phi$ it is described by the Emery--Kivelson (EK) model, where quantum phase fluctuations dominate. At $\phi_3 = 2.5 \times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, which corresponds to the AG--EK crossover, the spacing between CuO$_2$ planes $d_{01}$, the coherence length $\xi_c(0)$, and the fluctuation region $T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ increase sharply, and the two-dimensional Maki--Thompson (2D--MT) contribution is replaced by the Aslamazov--Larkin (2D--AL) term. Surprisingly, no signatures of the crossover appear in $\rho(\phi)$ or $T_c(\phi)$. At the same $\phi_3$, a sharp rise in the pseudogap opening temperature $T^{*}$ and in $\Delta^{*}$ indicates a possible reduction of the density of states. With further increase in $\phi$, both PG parameters and their energy scale decrease markedly, and $\Delta^{*}(T)$ acquires an unusual form. However, at $\phi_5 = 5.6 \times 10^{19}$ e/cm$^2$, the temperature dependences of FLC and PG again show behavior typical of well-structured YBCO, regardless of defect density.

Title: Effect of cold rolling strain on the microstructural evolution in equimolar MoNbTaTiZr refractory complex concentrated alloy: Comprehensive characterization
Authors: Andrea Skolakova, Haruka Katayama, Pavel Lejcek, Orsolya Molnarova, Sadahiro Tsurekawa, Petr Vertat, Jan Duchon, Jaroslav Cech, Petr Svora, Ondrej Ekrt, Jan Pinc
Abstract: This work presents a pilot study on a strained complex concentrated alloy based on refractory elements: MoNbTaTiZr. Initially, the as-cast and homogenization-annealed conditions were characterized. After casting, the alloy consists of two solid solutions with BCC 1 and BCC 2 crystal structures. Homogenization annealing promotes the growth, ordering, and refinement of the BCC 2 phase. TEM and AES analyses indicate possible Zr segregation at grain boundaries in the as-cast state. In contrast, annealing followed by cooling results in the formation of Ti-Zr-based particles without segregation. Subsequently, the annealed alloy was cold-rolled, and its microstructure was investigated. During rolling, grain fragmentation occurs within the structure. In addition to the two BCC solid solutions, a phase with an FCC crystal structure is identified after rolling. Its composition corresponds to the Zr2Ta phase, which is a Laves phase of the A2B type. Rotational relationships, relatively rare in rolled materials with BCC structures, are identified. The texture components found after 10% rolling deformation are related to that present after 20% deformation by a 45 degrees <110> rotation, and this component is related to that appearing after 30% deformation by a 20 degrees <100> rotation. However, no distinct rolling texture or clear texture development was observed, although some mutual relationships among preferred orientations can be identified. Schmid and Taylor factor maps demonstrate that, despite deformation, the alloy remains capable of further strain accumulation and plastic deformation. Twinning is also observed after rolling, which may be beneficial, as deformation twinning contributes to improved ductility in the alloy.

Title: Kerr effect induced by exchange interaction of electrons separated by a tunnel barrier in a double quantum well
Authors: V.K. Kalevich, K.V. Kavokin, M.M. Afanasiev, B.F. Gribakin, M.I. Kuzmenko, G. Karczewski, Yu.G. Kusrayev
Abstract: In a structure with two tunnel-coupled quantum wells of different widths, the spin dynamics resulting from resonant pulsed optical pumping of the narrow-well exciton includes the wide-well electron magnetization dynamics. Our analysis shows that the effect is driven by electron exchange between narrow-well excitons and spin-polarized electrons in the wide well. A theoretical model of the spin Kerr effect has been developed accounting for the interwell electron spin exchange. In the studied double-well structure with CdTe and Cd$_{0.98}$Mn$_{0.02}$Te quantum wells and a well-separating barrier thickness of 5 monolayers (1.6 nm), the model accurately describes the experimental results and allows us to estimate the interwell electron exchange constant as $\delta_{e} \approx 0.9\times10^{-15}~\textrm{eV}~\textrm{cm}^{2}$.

Title: High-throughput characterization of snap-through stability boundaries of bistable beams in a programmable rotating platform
Authors: Eduardo Gutierrez-Prieto, Gilad Yakir, Pedro M. Reis
Abstract: We introduce a high-throughput platform that enables simultaneous, parallel testing of six bistable beams via programmable motion of a rotating disk. By prescribing harmonic angular dynamics, the platform explores the phase space of angular velocity and acceleration $(\Omega,\,\dot{\Omega})$, producing continuously varying centrifugal and Euler force fields that act as tunable body forces in our specimens. Image processing extracts beam kinematics with sub-pixel accuracy, enabling precise identification of snap-through events. By testing six beams in parallel, the platform allows systematic variation of beam thickness, pre-compression, tilt angle, and clamp orientations across 65 distinct configurations, generating 23,400 individual experiments. We construct stability boundaries and quantitatively parameterize them as parabolic functions, characterized by a vertical offset and a curvature parameter. Tilt angle provides the most robust mechanism for tuning the curvature parameter, while beam thickness and pre-compression modulate vertical offset. Modal decomposition analysis reveals that antisymmetric clamp configurations can trigger mode switching, in which competing geometric and inertial effects drive transitions through different deformation pathways. Our work establishes a scalable experimental framework for high-throughput characterization of dynamic nonlinear instabilities in mechanics. The complete experimental dataset is made publicly available to support data-driven design and machine learning models for nonlinear mechanics with applications to bistability-based metamaterials, mechanical memory, and electronics-free sensing systems.

Title: Checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice States in Overdoped Cuprate Superconductors

Abstract: Cuprate superconductors remain central to condensed matter physics due to their technological relevance and unconventional, incompletely understood electronic behavior. While the canonical phase diagram and low-energy models have been shaped largely by studies of underdoped and moderately doped cuprates, the overdoped regime has received comparatively limited this http URL, we track the evolution of the electronic structure from optimal to heavy overdoping in La2-xSrxCuO4(LSCO) using broadband optical spectroscopy across x=0.15-0.60. The measured spectral changes--including the redistribution of Zhang-Rice-related spectral weigh--are in qualitative agreement with determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the three-orbital Emery model, which together indicate a pronounced reconstruction of the electronic structure beyond hole concentrations x>0.2. Guided by these observations, we propose a spontaneous checkerboard-type Zhang-Rice electronic configuration that captures the coexistence of itinerant and localized carriers characteristic of the heavily overdoped state. Our results refine the doping-dependent Zhang-Rice-based framework for cuprates, illuminate how correlations persist deep into the overdoped regime, and provide new constraints on microscopic mechanisms of high-temperature superconductivity, with broader implications for correlated transition-metal oxides.

Title: Study of fluctuation conductivity in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_7$--$δ$ films in strong magnetic fields
Authors: E. V. Petrenko, L. V. Omelchenko, Yu. A. Kolesnichenko, N. V. Shytov, K. Rogacki, D. M. Sergeyev, A. L. Solovjov
Abstract: We report the effect of the \emph{ab}-plane magnetic field $B$ up to $8\,\mathrm{T}$ on the resistivity $\rho(T)$ and fluctuation conductivity $\sigma'(T)$ in YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ thin films. As expected, up to $\sim 2.5\,\mathrm{T}$ the magnetic field monotonously increases $\rho$, the width of the resistive transition $\Delta T_c$, and the coherence length along the $c$ axis, $\xi_c(0)$, but decreases both $T_c$ and the range of superconducting (SC) fluctuations $\Delta _{\mathrm{fl}}$. The fluctuation conductivity exhibits a crossover at characteristic temperature $T_0$ from the 3D Aslamazov--Larkin (AL) theory near $T_c$ to the 2D fluctuation theory of Maki--Thompson (MT). However, at $B = 3\,\mathrm{T}$, the MT term is completely suppressed, and above $T_0$ $\sigma'(T)$ is unexpectedly described by the fluctuation contribution of 2D AL, suggesting the formation of a two-dimensional vortex lattice in the film under the action of a magnetic field. At the same time, $\Delta T_{\mathrm{fl}}$ sharply increases by a factor of about 7, and $\xi_c(0)$ demonstrates a very unusual dependence on $T_c$ when $B$ increases above $3\,\mathrm{T}$. Our results demonstrate the possibility of the formation of a vortex state in YBCO and its evolution with increasing $B$.

Title: Magnetic properties of molecular beam epitaxy-grown ultrathin Cr2Ge2Te6 films down to monolayer limit on Si substrates

Abstract: Cr2Ge2Te6, a prototypical van der Waals ferromagnetic semiconductor, have attracted significant interest for its potential applications in high-performance spintronics. However, the magnetic ground state of monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 remains elusive due to fragile and irregular-shaped thin flake samples with weak magnetic signals. Here, we successfully grow uniform ferromagnetic Cr2Ge2Te6 films down to monolayer by molecular beam epitaxy. By exploiting a self-limiting growth mode, we achieve synthesis of uniform monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 films across entire millimeter-scale Si substrates. Through a combination of superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry and anomalous Hall effect measurements, we establish that monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6 exhibits intrinsic ferromagnetism with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy below ~10 K, albeit with strong magnetic fluctuations characteristic of its two-dimensional nature. Furthermore, a systematic thickness-dependent study reveals a crossover from this fluctuation-dominated two-dimensional magnetism turns into conventional long-range ferromagnetic order as the film thickness increases. Our work not only definitively establishes the intrinsic ferromagnetic ground state of monolayer Cr2Ge2Te6, but also provides a scalable, silicon-compatible route for preparing the two-dimensional magnet for future spintronic or quantum devices.

Title: Structural Phase Transition and Cooperative Luminescence in K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ for Multimodal Down-shifting and Up-converting Luminescence Thermometry
Authors: Anam Javaid, Maja Szymczak, Damian Szymanski, Lukasz Marciniak
Abstract: To develop a more universal luminescent thermometer that provides both high relative sensitivity and the ability to measure temperature across different spectral ranges and excitation wavelengths, the K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ system was proposed in this work. It was demonstrated that this material undergoes a structural phase transition from the monoclinic to the hexagonal phase above 450 K. This transition enabled the construction of a ratiometric, phase-transition-based thermometer utilizing the luminescence intensity ratio of Stark lines of Eu3+ and Yb3+ ions, which exhibit SRmax values of 4.2% K^-1 and 1.15% K^-1, respectively. Moreover, increasing the Eu3+ ion concentration was shown to raise the phase transition temperature, thereby shifting the thermal operating range of both luminescent thermometers. Under 980 nm excitation, K3Yb(PO4)2:Eu3+ exhibits both cooperative luminescence from Yb3+ pairs and up-conversion emission from Eu3+ ions. Increasing the Eu3+ concentration enhances the Eu3+ luminescence intensity relative to the cooperative luminescence of Yb3+ pairs, resulting in a change in the emitted light color. The difference in the thermal quenching behavior of these two signals further enabled the development of a ratiometric thermometer with SRmax = 0.58% K^-1. These findings identify K3Yb(PO4)3:Eu3+ as a promising candidate for multimodal temperature sensing.

Title: Single-crystal growth, structural characterization, and physical properties of a decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl
Authors: Jingjing Jing, Andreas Eich, Yiqiu Liu, Lunhua He, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Young Sun, Yi Cui, Weiqiang Yu, Xinrun Mi, Michael Merz, Mingquan He
Abstract: The square-kagome lattice, composed of two-dimensional corner-sharing triangles, provides a novel platform for studying frustrated magnetism. However, material realizations of the square-kagome lattice remain scarce. Here, we report the single-crystal growth, structural characterization, magnetic and electric properties of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl, a nabokoite-type compound featuring a distorted and decorated square-kagome lattice. Weak anomalies near 4 K are observed in both magnetization and specific heat, indicating the onset of a magnetic this http URL formation of a long-range antiferromagnetic state below 4.5 K is further confirmed by $^{35}$Cl nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) measurements. Magnetic susceptibility data reveal nearly isotropic Curie-Weiss temperatures ($\sim-145$ K) and $g$-factors ($\sim2.4$) for both in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields. Moreover, we observe two successive ferroelectric transitions at $T_\mathrm{FE1}\sim30$ K and $T_\mathrm{FE2}\sim27$ K, driven by inversion-symmetry breaking, most likely associated with distortions in the Cu2O$_4$Cl$_1$ pyramids and the adjacent SO$_4$ tetrahedra. These results suggest that a three-dimensional model incorporating interlayer couplings via decorating sites is essential for capturing the magnetic and electric behaviors in KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl.

Title: Unified theory of local integrals of motion
Authors: Ben Craps, Oleg Evnin, Dmitry Kovrizhin, Gabriele Pascuzzi
Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) is understood theoretically through the existence of an extensive number of local integrals of motion (LIOMs). These conserved quantities are related to the microscopic quantum degrees of freedom that are spatially localized. Here, we present a general framework for constructing exact LIOMs with the desired locality and quantum numbers supplied as input rather than arising as emergent properties. We show that one can express the task of finding LIOMs as an optimization problem. In simple cases, solving this problem amounts to matrix diagonalization, while in more complex settings, it connects to the question of finding classical ground states of spin-glass models. We illustrate our theory using paradigmatic examples of single-particle Anderson localization and MBL in interacting spin chains. These developments unify previous results and reveal intriguing connections among many-body localization, spin-glass physics and constrained optimization problems.

Title: Self-Trapping of Microorganisms Steering Toward their Own Trail
Authors: Aymeric Lutier, Frédéric van Wijland, Jean-Baptiste Fournier
Abstract: Active matter systems comprise self-propelled particles that move on a substrate while leaving chemical trails that influence other particles through chemotaxis (e.g., slime-depositing bacteria). Orientational chemotaxis manifests as a torque that steers the particle toward the chemical gradient. As each particle is coupled to its own trail, the dynamics exhibits an instability: when the particle gently diffuses, it abruptly transitions to trajectories with a radius of curvature comparable to its own size, becoming apparently trapped. We argue that, contrary to intuition, this trajectory instability occurs for any chemotactic coupling strength. Depending on the coupling regime, this arises either through a potential-barrier first-passage problem or from a rare event analysis.

Title: Unconventional bright ground-state excitons in monolayer TiI$_2$ from first-principles calculations
Authors: Franz Fischer, Carl Emil Mørch Nielsen, Marta Prada, Gabriel Bester
Abstract: Based on \textit{ab initio} screened configuration interaction calculations we find that TiI$_2$ has a bright exciton ground state and identify two key mechanisms that lead to this unprecedented feature among transition metal dichalcogenides. First, the spin-orbit induced conduction band splitting results in optically allowed spin-alignment for electrons and holes across a significant portion of the Brillouin zone around the $\mathbf{K}$-valley, avoiding band crossings seen in materials like monolayer MoSe$_2$. Second, a sufficiently weak exchange interaction ensures that the bright exciton remains energetically below the dark exciton state. We further show that the bright exciton ground state is stable under various mechanical strains and that trion states (charged excitons) inherit this bright ground state. Our findings are expected to spark further investigation into related materials that bring along the two key features mentioned, as bright ground-state excitons are crucial for applications requiring fast radiative recombination.

Title: Non-Hermitian trapping of Dirac exciton-polariton condensates in a perovskite metasurface
Authors: Mikhail Masharin, Igor Chestnov, Andrey Bochin, Pavel Kozhevin, Vanik Shahnazaryan, Alexey Yulin, Ivan Iorsh, Xuekai Ma, Stefan Schumacher, Sergey Makarov, Anton Samusev, Anton Nalitov
Abstract: Massless Dirac particles avoid trapping due to their exceptional tunneling properties manifested in the so-called Klein paradox. This conclusion stems from the conservative treatment, but so far, it has not been extended to a non-Hermitian framework. Recently, driven-dissipative bosonic condensation of Dirac exciton-polaritons was demonstrated in metasurface waveguides. Here, we report an experimental observation of spatial binding and energy quantization of Dirac exciton-polaritons in a halide perovskite metasurface. A combination of spatially profiled nonresonant optical excitation and exciton-polariton interaction forms an effective non-Hermitian complex potential responsible for the observed effect. In the case of tightly focused pump spots spanning from 9 to 17~$\mu$m, several bound states simultaneously achieve macroscopic occupation, constituting a multi-mode bosonic condensation of exciton-polaritons. Our theoretical analysis based on the driven-dissipative extension of the Dirac equation reveals that the non-Hermitian character of the effective trap allows for confinement even in the case of the gapless Dirac-like photonic dispersion, both above and below the energy of the dispersion crossing.

Title: Theoretical Characterization of the Magnetic Properties of Vanadium-doped Ti2C MXenes
Authors: Carlos Patiño, Pablo Díaz, Nicolás Vidal-Silva, Eduardo Cisternas, Eugenio Vogel, Fabian Dietrich
Abstract: MXenes are two-dimensional materials composed of transition metals and light elements, known for their high conductivity and versatile surface chemistry. The introduction of spin centers via doping can lead to promising materials for spintronics, magnetic sensing, and data storage. We study the effect of V doping in Ti2C using first principle and Monte-Carlo simulations. Our results show that pristine Ti2C exhibits ferromagnetic intralayer and antiferromagnetic interlayer exchange interactions, yielding an antiferromagnetic ground state. Vanadium incorporation alters these couplings, yet all doped configurations - Ti7VC4 and three Ti6V2C4 variants - retain predominantly antiferromagnetic order. Despite the preserved ground state, V doping enhances the magnetic response, most notably in the p-Ti6V2C4 configuration, which displays increased low-field susceptibility and partial spin alignment across layers. As experimentally isolating individual doped phases is unlikely, samples will consist of mixed configurations whose collective behavior nonetheless exhibits clear signatures of V-induced magnetic modification. These results reveal how transition-metal substitution tunes exchange interactions in MXenes and offer guidance for engineering their magnetic functionalities.

Title: Topological boundaries in non-Hermitian p-wave Kitaev chains with Rashba spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Shahroze Shahab, Aditi Chakrabarty, Sanjoy Datta
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the combined effects of Rashba spin-orbit coupling (RSOC) and non-Hermiticity on topological phase transitions in spinful p-wave Kitaev chains. While previous studies have separately examined non-Hermitian (NH) extensions of Kitaev chains and the effects of RSOC in Hermitian systems, the interplay between these two mechanisms remains largely unexplored. We analyze this interplay by considering two distinct types of complex on-site potentials: (i) a uniform gain/loss term and (ii) a complex quasiperiodic potential. We demonstrate that the impact of RSOC is highly model-dependent. In particular, RSOC does not affect the topological phase boundary in the Hermitian limit of the uniform gain/loss model (provided the spin-flip hopping is weaker than the pairing strength), but significantly alters the topological landscape in the NH regime. In contrast, for the quasiperiodic model, RSOC modifies the phase boundaries in both the Hermitian and non-Hermitian cases. Notably, we find that the combined interplay of non-Hermiticity and RSOC drives topological transitions at significantly lower potential strengths compared to the Hermitian limit. We derive analytical expressions for the topological phase transitions in both cases and validate our predictions through numerical calculations of energy spectra and real-space winding numbers. This work provides a comprehensive understanding of how non-Hermiticity and RSOC cooperatively reshape topological phase diagrams in one-dimensional superconducting systems.

Title: SiNx RRAMs performance with different stoichiometries
Authors: A.E. Mavropoulis, G. Pissanos, N. Vasileiadis, P. Normand, G.Ch. Sirakoulis, P. Dimitrakis
Abstract: The microstructure of SiNx is strongly affected by its stoichiometry, x. The stoichiometry of SiNx thin films can be modified by adjusting the gas flow rates during LPCVD deposition. The deficiency or excess of Si atoms enhance the formation of defects such as nitrogen vacancies, silicon dangling bonds etc., and thus can enable performance tuning of the resulting MIS RRAM devices. DC electrical characterization, impedance spectroscopy and constant voltage stress measurements were carried out to investigate the properties of non-stoichiometric silicon nitride films as resistive switching material. The average SET time for each device was measured by applying voltage ramps. Improvement in the SET/RESET voltages and SET time is observed. Finally, the stoichiometric film exhibits the lowest breakdown acceleration factor, while the Si-rich film the highest.

Abstract: This paper examines the resistive switching characteristics of LPCVD SiNx MNOS ReRAM cells on both heavily doped n- and p-type silicon substrates, focusing on the effects of nitrogen doping. Detailed comparisons of electrical properties through nitrogen implantation reveal variations in trap density and SET-RESET voltages between n and p conductivity Si substrates. Impedance spectroscopy further elucidates the conductive path formation and its resistance.

Title: Domain Wall Control of Topological Qubits in the Kitaev SSH Chain
Authors: Griffith Rufo, Sabrina Rufo, Heron Caldas
Abstract: Zero energy states in one dimensional SSH Kitaev hybrid systems have emerged as promising candidates for topological qubits. In our work, we show that introducing a domain wall into a chain with anisotropic superconducting correlations provides a powerful way to control both the number and the nature of these boundary modes. The defect acts as a digital knob: its presence or absence flips the parity of zero modes and thus decides whether an isolated Majorana exists at the chain ends. This on/off mechanism is significantly more robust and simpler than fine-tuning global parameters such as chemical potential or hopping amplitudes. Moreover, anisotropy provides an additional lever to calibrate the effect of the defect, opening a pathway to architectures where topological qubits can be locally addressed by domain walls. This proposal reframes defects not as imperfections, but as useful resources for quantum information and computation.

Title: Contrasting magnetic behavior in MnSc_2X_4 (X = S, Se) spinel compounds investigated by magnetoelastic studies
Authors: J. Grumbach, J. Sourd, M. Deeb, A. Miyata, H. Suwa, T. Gottschall, A. Hauspurg, S. Chattopadhyay, M. Rotter, S. Granovsky, L. Prodan, V. Tsurkan, S. Zherlitsyn, M. Doerr, J. Wosnitza
Abstract: The spinel compounds MnSc_2X_4 are highly frustrated and candidate materials for vortex-like 3q magnetic states, such as skyrmions, with propagation vectors in the [111] plane. Because of the strong magnetoelastic coupling, we could extract a refined magnetic (H, T) phase diagram for MnSc_2S_4 from ultrasound and dilatometry measurements. We found a variety of magnetic phases, including the skyrmion phase, which is stable down to lowest temperatures. In comparison, we investigated MnSc_2Se_4 , having a larger distance between the magnetic Mn^3+ ions using the same methods. Unlike in MnSc_2S_4 , we found no skyrmion phase and overall a lack of sharp anomalies indicative of phase transitions, neither in dilatometry nor ultrasound nor in specific heat and ac-susceptibility data. Motivated by our findings, we performed model calculations, which reproduced the experimentally observed magnetostriction and specific-heat results reasonably well.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of $γ$-Belite(010)-Water Interfaces with High-Dimensional Neural Network Potentials
Authors: Bernadeta Prus, Jörg Behler
Abstract: Belite -- dicalcium silicate Ca$_2$SiO$_4$ -- is a main constituent of low-carbon cement. In this work, we study several terminations of the (010) surface of $\gamma$-belite, its most stable polymorph, by molecular dynamics simulations. The energies and forces are provided by a high-dimensional neural network potential trained to density functional theory data. Water can interact in molecular form as well as dissociatively with the investigated interfaces, and the degree of dissociation is determined primarily by the protonation of SiO$_4$ groups accessible at the surface. A major part of the simultaneously formed hydroxide ions is adsorbed at surface calcium atoms, whose octahedral coordination spheres are completed by additional water molecules. The T3 termination, which is most stable in vacuum, shows only little reactivity in water. For the only slightly less stable T2 termination, however, two distinct types of surface defects are observed. The type I defect is even stable in vacuum and leads to a reconstruction of the entire surface, while the type II defect is only found in the presence of water. Overall, our results suggest that a variety of structures may be formed at the Ca$_2$SiO$_4$(010) surface, which are stabilized in the presence of water.

Title: Reinterpreting Landauer conductance, solving the quantum measurement problem, grand unification
Authors: Kanchan Meena, Souvik Ghosh, P. Singha Deo
Abstract: In a series of recent papers we have proved rigorously that time travel is a reality and very much feasible by using quantum mechanical processes. There are plenty of indirect experimental support untill a direct experiment is conducted. The process crucially depend on the reality of a local time as well as a local partial density of states (LPDOS) that can become negative very easily in the quantum regime of mesoscopic systems. Mesoscopic systems are small enough to allow us to experimentally access the intemediate regime between the classical and quantum worlds. This LPDOS is in every sense a hidden variable in quantum mechanics that does not show up in the axiomatic framework of quantum mechanics. It can be infered through physical clocks obeying quantum dynamics and can be rigorously justified from the properties of the Hilbert space that is uniquely isomorphic to the complex plane. Therefore one can naturally guess that LPDOS will have something important to say about quantum measurement as well as the unification of classical and quantum laws. We therefore undertake the exercise to show that LPDOS can very much allow us to re-interpret the enormously successful phenomenological Landauer-Buttiker formalism for mesoscopic systems and put it on firm theoretical ground as a bridge between classical and quantum mechanics, thereby unifying them. Essentialy the local time calculated quantum mechanically can dialate exactly like the proper time of relativity and be consistent with the coordinate time of relativity. Also the measured conductance of mesoscopic samples is a deterministic quantum measurement outcome from a linear superposition of states, essentially because of LPDOS, which solves the quantum measurement problem. For this we analyze the three probe conductance formula in details and give our arguements for the general case.

Title: Time-dependent condensation of bosonic dysprosium
Authors: Max Regalado Kloos, Georg Wolschin
Abstract: We investigate thermalization and time-dependent Bose-Einstein condensate formation in ultracold Dy-164 using a nonlinear boson diffusion equation. As compared to alkali atoms such as K-39 or Rb-87, the strong magnetic dipole interaction modifies the scattering-length dependence of the transport coefficients that govern thermalization and condensate formation. A prediction for the time-dependent condensate fraction in Dy-164 is made.

Title: Synchronization of thermodynamically consistent stochastic phase oscillators
Authors: Maciej Chudak, Massimiliano Esposito, Krzysztof Ptaszynski
Abstract: We consider a toy model of two kinetically coupled stochastic oscillators whose dynamics is described as a Markov jump process among $N$ discrete phase states. For large $N$, it maps onto the deterministic two-oscillator Kuramoto model of synchronization. Despite its simplicity, we postulate its relevance for understanding more complex and realistic oscillator systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the model exhibits a continuous nonequilibrium phase transition between the unsynchronized and synchronized states. We show that this transition is not governed by any extremum dissipation principle -- depending on system parameters, synchronization may either reduce or enhance the dissipation. Close to the phase transition, we observe a divergent behavior of fluctuations and responses with $N$ and characterize their universal scaling behavior. In particular, the covariances of the oscillator phases and the local entropy productions are shown to diverge towards $-\infty$, a phenomenon that has not been reported before. Finally, we study the behavior of information-theoretic quantities, demonstrating that mutual information and information flow between oscillators display different scaling with $N$ in synchronized and unsynchronized states, and thus can act as order parameters of synchronization.

Title: Burgers equation from non-thermal stationary states in nearly-integrable gases
Authors: Paweł Lisiak, Maciej Łebek, Miłosz Panfil
Abstract: When a gas of particles interacts with much a larger reservoir the dynamics of density on large scales is typically governed by diffusion. We study this paradigmatic problem for weakly coupled integrable systems and show that this picture is altered when transport is investigated on top of long-lived non-thermal states. Remarkably, for states non-invariant under parity we find Burgers equation arising in the hydrodynamic limit. We explicitly compute the diffusion constant and nonlinear Euler-scale coupling of the Burgers equation using a variant of the Chapman-Enskog theory. We find excellent agreement between our theory and numerical simulations of a simplified model of stochastic two-body collisions, which we call velocity swap models. Our conclusions are based only on Galilean invariance, existence of a small system-bath coupling parameter and a small momentum exchange between the system and the bath.

Title: Structural Optimization in Tensor LEED Using a Parameter Tree and $R$-Factor Gradients
Authors: Alexander M. Imre, Paul Haidegger, Florian Kraushofer, Ralf Wanzenböck, Tobias Hable, Sarah Tobisch, Marie Kienzer, Florian Buchner, Jesús Carrete, Georg K. H. Madsen, Michael Schmid, Ulrike Diebold, Michele Riva
Abstract: Quantitative low-energy electron diffraction [LEED $I(V)$] is a powerful method for surface-structure determination, based on a direct comparison of experimentally observed $I(V)$ data with computations for a structure model. As the diffraction intensities $I$ are highly sensitive to subtle structural changes, local structure optimization is essential for assessing the validity of a structure model and finding the best-fit structure. The calculation of diffraction intensities is well established, but the large number of evaluations required for reliable structural optimization renders it computationally demanding. The computational effort is mitigated by the tensor-LEED approximation, which accelerates optimization by applying a perturbative treatment of small deviations from a reference structure. Nevertheless, optimization of complex structures is a tedious process. Here, the problem of surface-structure optimization is reformulated using a tree-based data structure, which helps to avoid redundant function evaluations. In the new tensor-LEED implementation presented in this work, intensities are computed on the fly, eliminating limitations of previous algorithms that are limited to precomputed values at a grid of search parameters. It also enables the use of state-of-the-art optimization algorithms. Implemented in \textsc{Python} with the JAX library, the method provides access to gradients of the $R$ factor and supports execution on graphics processing units (GPUs). Based on these developments, the computing time can be reduced by more than an order of magnitude.

Title: Hitting the blinking target under stochastic resetting
Authors: Bartosz Zbik, Bartłomiej Dybiec, Karol Capała, Zbigniew Palmowski, Igor M. Sokolov
Abstract: The first hitting times of a stochastic process, i.e., the first time a process reaches a particular level, are of significant interest across various scientific disciplines, including biology, chemistry, and economics. We modify the standard setup by allowing the target to spontaneously switch between two states, either active or inactive, and investigate the distribution of first hitting times accrued while the target is active. For this setup, we provide closed formulas for the distribution of the first hitting time. Additionally, we can introduce stochastic resetting to the underlying process and, utilizing our results, derive the formulas for the first time the active target is hit by the process under stochastic resetting. Interestingly, we show that resetting in this setup still leaves some memory; the system is no longer Markovian, which prevents a straightforward application of standard techniques. The analytical results are accompanied by computer simulations of Langevin dynamics.

Title: Gate tuning of coupled electronic and structural phase transition in atomically thin Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
Authors: Keyu Wei, Yixuan Luo, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Yanfeng Guo, Xiaoxiang Xi
Abstract: Realizing an excitonic insulator phase from narrow-gap semiconductors remains challenging, as unambiguous experimental signatures are difficult to establish. Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ has been widely regarded as a leading candidate, yet the nature of its phase transition and insulating state remains controversial. Here, we report a systematic Raman spectroscopy study of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ as a function of thickness and field-effect doping, complemented by electrical transport measurements. The phase transition persists down to the monolayer limit, with the critical temperature increasing as thickness decreases. In bilayer samples, both electron and hole doping suppress the insulating state, with electron doping lowering and hole doping raising the transition temperature. Importantly, the quasi-elastic scattering, previously attributed to excitonic fluctuations, evolves monotonically across the entire doping range, inconsistent with the expected suppression of excitonic correlations by Coulomb screening. These findings rule out a dominant excitonic mechanism and instead point to a coupled electronic and structural phase transition, whose stability is tunable by carrier doping. Our doping-based approach offers a general strategy for evaluating the role of excitonic effects in candidate excitonic insulators.

Title: Dimensional crossover and finite-range effects in a quasi-two-dimensional gas of fermionic dimers
Authors: Giovanni Midei, Jordi Boronat, Grigory E. Astrakharchik
Abstract: We investigate the ground-state properties of ultracold two-component Fermi gases in the presence of a transverse harmonic potential, focusing on the strongly interacting regime in which pairs of fermions form tightly bound molecules. Using the fixed-node diffusion Monte Carlo method, we calculate the equation of state and density profiles for the full fermionic system, which allows us to address the importance of finite-range corrections arising from the internal fermionic structure of the composite bosons. We interpret the results in terms of a molecular Bose gas in quasi-two-dimensional confinement and compare them with theoretical predictions for a weakly interacting two-dimensional Bose gas, identifying the range of validity of mean-field and beyond-mean-field descriptions. We also develop an analytical theory for the transverse density profile, capturing its broadening with increasing interaction strength. This work provides a benchmark for an effective bosonic description of strongly bound fermionic dimers and offers new insights into the three- to two-dimensional crossover.

Title: Biaxial Strain Modulation of Exciton-Phonon Resonance in WS2
Authors: Álvaro Rodríguez, Carmen Munuera, Andres Castellanos-Gomez
Abstract: Mechanical strain provides a powerful route to tune light-matter interactions in two-dimensional semiconductors, yet the impact of biaxial strain on resonant Raman scattering remains poorly quantified. Here we use a cruciform bending platform to apply uniform biaxial strain up to 1.3% to trilayer WS2 while simultaneously monitoring excitonic and vibrational responses. Differential reflectance reveals strain-induced red-shifts of the A and B excitons, with the B exciton moving by about 170 meV. Under 532 nm excitation, this shift drives a continuous transition from resonant to non-resonant Raman scattering, leading to a pronounced collapse of the 2LA(M) mode. The 2LA(M) intensity is quantitatively described by a resonance model expressed in terms of the B-exciton energy, which yields an effective exciton-assisted linewidth of about 34 meV and shows that the maximum enhancement occurs when the laser lies roughly 50 meV below the exciton. The first-order phonons remain narrow and reversible over the full strain cycle, confirming elastic deformation and efficient isotropic strain transfer. Our results establish biaxial strain as a practical and reversible route to modulate exciton-phonon coupling and Raman scattering cross-sections, enabling mechanically reconfigurable optical and photonic functionalities in layered semiconductors.

Title: Evolution of the pseudogap and excess conductivity of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-δ}$ single crystals in the course of long-term aging
Authors: A. L. Solovjov, L. V. Bludova, M. V. Shytov, S. N. Kamchatnaya, Z. F. Nazyrov, R. V. Vovk
Abstract: The temperature dependences of both fluctuation conductivity (FLC) $\sigma^\prime(T)$ and pseudogap (PG) $\Delta^*(T)$ derived from measurements of resistivity $\rho(T)$ of an optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystal subjected to long-term storage have been studied. The as-grown sample S1 exhibits characteristics typical of optimally doped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ single crystals containing twins and twin boundaries. Analysis of both FLC and PG showed an unexpected improvement in all characteristics of the sample after 6 years of storage (sample S2), indicating that the effect of twin boundaries is somehow limited. After 17 years of storage, all characteristics of the sample changed dramatically, which indicates a strong influence of internal defects formed during the aging process. For the first time, the temperature dependences of both FLC and PG were obtained after 17 years of storage.

Title: A Rapid-prototyping CMOS-RRAM Integration Strategy
Authors: Andreas Tsiamis, Spyros Stathopoulos, Themis Prodromakis
Abstract: Moore's law has long served the semiconductor industry as the driving force for producing ever-advancing electronics technologies. However, given the economic implications and technological challenges associated with the present semiconductor scaling constraints, a shift from a traditional more Moore approach to a beyond Moore paradigm is desirable for sustaining the current pace of innovation beyond the established development route. Resistive random-access memories (RRAM) are one such beyond Moore technology that offers many avenues for innovation, and when integrated with mature complementary metal oxide semiconductors (CMOS), can extend CMOS capabilities in a scalable and power-efficient manner, both in terms of memory and computation. Nevertheless, as emerging and established technologies fuse, existing semiconductor-optimised manufacturing faces significant challenges, while the methodologies and complexities of integration are often not highlighted in depth, or overlooked at the expense of demonstrating the application-specific integrated-technologies. In this article, we focus on the integration, and detail a cost-effective, rapid-prototyping, and technology agnostic CMOS-RRAM integration strategy that employs hybridised wafer-level and multi-reticle processing techniques, supported by a systematic increased complexity approach. Leveraging the fact that CMOS technologies can be readily realised by taking advantage of mature front-end-of-line fabrication processes offered by semiconductor foundries, we establish an in-house RRAM development program that allows to combine fundamental material and device-level knowledge with custom-designed CMOS electronics. This approach utilises fully CMOS-compatible and transferable processes, ultimately enabling a seamless transition from research and development to volume production.

Title: Burgers dynamics for Poisson point process initial conditions of the Weibull class
Authors: Patrick Valageas
Abstract: We derive the statistical properties of one-dimensional Burgers dynamics with stochastic initial conditions for the velocity potential defined by a Poisson point process whose intensity follows a power law with exponent $\alpha > -1$. Working in the inviscid limit and exploiting the geometrical construction of solutions in terms of first-contact parabolas, we derive explicit analytical expressions for a broad set of statistical quantities. These include the one- and two-point probability distributions of the velocity, the multiplicity functions of voids and shocks, and the velocity and density correlation functions together with their associated power spectra. We also show that the full hierarchy of $n$-point distributions factorizes into a sequence of two-point conditional probabilities. This class of initial conditions leads to self-similar evolution and produces probability distributions characterized by stretched-exponential tails, with tail exponents spanning the full range from unity to infinity. The associated characteristic length scale grows as a power law of time, with an exponent lying between zero and one half.

Title: Linear and Nonlinear Optical Properties of SiO$_2$/TiO$_2$ Heterostructures Grown by Plasma Enhanced Atomic Layer Deposition
Authors: Jinsong Liu, Martin Mičulka, Raihan Rafi, Sebastian Beer, Denys Sevriukov, Stefan Nolte, Sven Schröder, Andreas Tünnermann, Isabelle Staude, Adriana Szeghalmi
Abstract: Second harmonic (SH) radiation can only be generated in non-centrosymmetric bulk crystals under electric dipole approximation. Nonlinear thin films made from bulk crystals are technologically challenging because of complex and high temperature fabrication processes. In this work, heterostructures made of amorphous materials SiO$_2$ and TiO$_2$ were prepared by a CMOS-compatible technique named plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) with deposition temperature at 100 °C. By using the uniaxial dispersion model, we characterized the form-birefringence property, which can enable the phase matching condition in waveguides or other nonlinear optical applications. By applying a fringe-based technique, we determined the largest diagonal component of the effective second-order bulk susceptibility $\chi_{zzz}^{(2)}$ = 1.30$\pm$0.13 pm/V at a wavelength of 1032 nm. Noteworthy, we observed strong SHG signals from two-component nanolaminates which are several orders of magnitude larger than from single layers. The SHG signals from our samples only require the broken inversion symmetry at the interface. Here optical properties of nanocomposites can be precisely tuned by the promising PEALD technology.

Title: The Impact of Magnons, Defects, and Rapid Energy Migration on the Optical Properties of the 2D Magnet CrPS4
Authors: Jacob T. Baillie, Eden Tzanetopoulos, Rachel T. Smith, Remi Beaulac, Daniel R. Gamelin
Abstract: Strong coupling between optical and magnetic excitations could enable contactless, spatially resolved, or ultrafast interrogation and control of magnetism two-dimensional (2D) materials and devices. The layered 2D A-type antiferromagnet CrPS4 stands out among van der Waals (vdW) magnets for its rich optical fine structure, but its spectroscopy is not yet understood and has so far been interpreted without consideration of magnetic exchange. Here, we show that this fine structure comes primarily from exchange-mediated coupling between on-site optical "spin-flip" transitions of Cr3+ and low-energy spin transitions involving the surrounding lattice. Well-resolved magnon sidebands to optical 4A2 <--> 2E transitions are observed in photoluminescence (PL) and PL excitation spectra, as well as a pronounced PL sideband due to short-range exchange splitting. Energy migration is probed using Yb3+ dopants as traps, revealing sub-picosecond inter-site excitation hopping. Formation of dispersive Frenkel excitons of coupled on-site d-d transitions due to inter-site exchange is discussed. In addition to impacting how optical fine structure is interpreted in this and potentially other vdW magnets, these findings may have ramifications for future applications of layered 2D magnets by revealing new opportunities to drive mode-specific spin-wave excitations using light.

Title: Multimodal motion and behavior switching of multistable ciliary walkers
Authors: Sumit Mohanty, Paul Baconnier, Harmannus A.H. Schomaker, Alberto Comoretto, Martin van Hecke, Johannes T.B. Overvelde
Abstract: The collective motion of arrays of cilia - tiny, hairlike protrusions - drives the locomotion of numerous microorganisms, enabling multimodal motion and autonomous switching between gaits to navigate complex environments. To endow minimalist centimeter-scale robots with similarly rich dynamics, we introduce millimeter-scale flexible cilia that buckle under the robots weight, coupling multistability and actuation within a single physical mechanism. When placed on a vibrating surface, these ciliary walkers select their propulsion direction through the buckled states of their cilia, allowing multimodal motion and switching between modes in response to perturbations. We first show that bimodal walkers with left-right symmetric cilia can autonomously reverse direction upon encountering obstacles. Next, we demonstrate that walkers with isotropic cilia exhibit both translational and rotational motion and switch between them in response to environmental interactions. At increasing densities, swarms of such walkers collectively transition from predominantly spinning to translational motion. Finally, we show that the shape, placement and number of cilia controls the modes of motion of the walkers. Our results establish a rational, physically grounded strategy for designing minimalist soft robots where complex behaviors emerge from feedback between internal mechanical states and environmental interactions, laying the foundation for autonomous robotic collectives without the need for centralized control.

Title: Programmable Assembly of Ground State Fermionic Tweezer Arrays
Authors: Naman Jain, Jin Zhang, Marcus Culemann, Philipp M. Preiss
Abstract: We demonstrate deterministic preparation of arbitrary two-component product states of fermionic $^6$Li atoms in an 8$\times$8 optical tweezer array, achieving motional ground-state fidelities above 98.5\%. Leveraging the large differential magnetic moments for spin-resolution, with parallelized site- and number-resolved control, our approach addresses key challenges for low-entropy quantum state engineering. Combined with high-fidelity spin-, site-, and density-resolved readout within a single \qty{20}{\us} exposure, and \qty{3}{\s} experimental cycles, these advances establish a fast, scalable, and programmable architecture for fermionic quantum simulation.

Abstract: We report on an imaging scheme for quantum gases that enables simultaneous detection of two spin states with single-atom resolution. It utilizes the polarization of the emitted photons during fluorescence by choosing appropriate internal states of lithium-6 atoms in a magnetic field. This scheme can readily be implemented to obtain in-situ spin correlations in a wide variety of experimental settings.

Title: Superconductivity and geometric superfluid weight of a tunable flat band system
Authors: M. A. Mojarro, Sergio E. Ulloa
Abstract: We study superconductivity and superfluid weight of the two-dimensional $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice with on-site asymmetries, hosting an isolated quasi-flat band with tunable bandwidth via a parameter $\alpha$. Within a mean-field approximation of the attractive Hubbard model, we obtain the superconducting order parameters on the three inequivalent sublattices and show their strong dependence on $\alpha$, interaction strength, and electron filling. At quasi-flat band filling, a superconducting gap opens and grows power-law fast with interaction strength, instead of the usual slow exponential growth, due to diverging density of states. We calculate the superfluid weight from linear response theory and study its band dispersion and geometric contributions. While the conventional part proportional to band derivatives is suppressed in the quasi-flat band regime, the contribution dominated by the quantum metric grows linearly for small interaction strength. We further demonstrate how tuning $\alpha$ enhances the quantum metric and thus the geometric superfluid weight especially near half-filling, while increasing on-site asymmetries increases the conventional contribution by broadening the quasi-flat band. We obtain the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless transition temperature and demonstrate its strong dependence and enhancement with the parameter $\alpha$. Our results establish a tunable flat band system, the $\alpha$-$\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice model, as a candidate for tunable quantum geometry and superfluid weight and as a prototype of related behavior in tunable quantum materials.

Title: Connecting single-layer $t$-$J$ to Kondo lattice models: Exploration with cold atoms
Authors: Hannah Lange, Eugene Demler, Jan von Delft, Annabelle Bohrdt, Fabian Grusdt
Abstract: The Kondo effect, a hallmark of many-body physics, emerges from the antiferromagnetic coupling between localized spins and conduction fermions, leading to a correlated many-body singlet state. Here we propose to use the mixed-dimensional (mixD) bilayer Hubbard geometry as a platform to study Kondo lattice physics with current ultracold atom experiments. At experimentally feasible temperatures, we predict that key features of the Kondo effect can be observed, including formation of the Kondo cloud around a single impurity and the competition of singlet formation with Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interactions for multiple impurities, summarized in the Doniach phase diagram. Moreover, we show that the mixD platform provides a natural bridge between the Doniach phase diagram of the Kondo lattice model, relevant to heavy-fermion materials, and the phase diagram of cuprate superconductors as described by a single-layer Zhang-Rice type $t$-$J$ model: It is possible to continuously tune between the two regimes by changing the interlayer Kondo coupling. Our findings demonstrate that the direct connection between high-temperature superconductivity and heavy-fermion physics can be experimentally studied using currently available quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Real-time collisions of fractional charges in a trapped-ion Jackiw-Rebbi field theory
Authors: Alan Kahan, Pablo Viñas, Torsten V. Zache, Alejandro Bermudez
Abstract: We propose and analyze a trapped-ion quantum simulator of the Jackiw-Rebbi model, a paradigmatic quantum field theory in (1+1) dimensions where solitonic excitations of a scalar field can bind fermionic zero modes leading to fractionally charged excitations. In our approach, the scalar field is a coarse-grained description of the planar zigzag ion displacements in the vicinity of a structural phase transition. The internal electronic states of the ions encode spins with interactions mediated by the transverse phonons and in-plane spin-phonon couplings with a zigzag pattern, which together correspond to a Yukawa-coupled Dirac field. Instead of assuming a fixed soliton background, we study the effect of back-reaction and quantum fluctuations on the coupled dynamics of the full fermion-boson system. We start by applying a Born-Oppenheimer approximation to obtain an effective Peierls-Nabarro potential for the topological kink, unveiling how the fermionic back-reaction can lead to localization of the kink. Beyond this limit, a truncated Wigner approximation combined with fermionic Gaussian states captures the quantum spreading and localization of a kink and kink-antikink scattering. Our results reveal how back-reaction and quantum fluctuations modify the stability and real-time evolution of fractionalized fermions, predicting experimentally accessible signatures in current trapped-ion architectures.

Title: Measurement-and Feedback-Driven Non-Equilibrium Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor
Authors: Zhiyi Wu, Xuandong Sun, Songlei Wang, Jiawei Zhang, Xiaohan Yang, Ji Chu, Jingjing Niu, Youpeng Zhong, Xiao Chen, Zhi-Cheng Yang, Dapeng Yu
Abstract: Mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations conditioned on the measurement outcomes are essential for implementing quantum error-correction on quantum hardware. When integrated in quantum many-body dynamics, they can give rise to novel non-equilibrium phase transitions both at the level of each individual quantum trajectory and the averaged quantum channel. Experimentally resolving both transitions on realistic devices has been challenging due to limitations on the fidelity and the significant latency for performing mid-circuit measurements and feedback operations in real time. Here, we develop a superconducting quantum processor that enables global mid-circuit measurement with an average quantum non-demolition (QND) fidelity of 98.7% and fast conditional feedback with a 200 ns real-time decision latency. Using this platform, we demonstrate the coexistence of an absorbing-state transition in the quantum channel and a measurement-induced entanglement transition at the level of individual quantum trajectories. For the absorbing-state transition, we experimentally extract a set of critical exponents at the transition point, which is in excellent agreement with the directed percolation universality class. Crucially, the two transitions occur at distinct values of the tuning parameter. Our results demonstrate that adaptive quantum circuits provide a powerful platform for exploring non-equilibrium quantum many-body dynamics.

Title: Slow dynamics and magnon bound states in the 2D long-range quantum Ising model
Authors: Vighnesh Dattatraya Naik, Markus Heyl
Abstract: The dynamics of long-range quantum Ising models represents a current frontier in experimental physics, notably in trapped ions or Rydberg atomic systems. However, a theoretical description of these dynamics beyond 1D remains a significant challenge for conventional methods. Here, we address this challenge by means of neural quantum states to simulate global quenches from the fully polarized ferromagnetic state in the 2D quantum Ising model with power-law decaying interactions. From these numerically exact simulations, we find that the dynamics exhibit slow relaxation with long-lived oscillations. We explain this behavior through a theory for the formation of magnon bound states, which are generated, as we show, through effective attractive interactions between magnons that persist over several lattice sites due to the power-law nature of the interactions. Our results are readily observable in current quantum simulation platforms realizing long-range interacting models such as in Rydberg atomic systems.

Title: Optimizing the dynamical preparation of quantum spin lakes on the ruby lattice
Authors: DinhDuy Vu, Dominik S. Kufel, Jack Kemp, Lode Pollet, Chris R. Laumann, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Quantum spin liquids are elusive long-range entangled states. Motivated by experiments in Rydberg quantum simulators, recent excitement has centered on the possibility of dynamically preparing a state with quantum spin liquid correlation even when the ground state phase diagram does not exhibit such a topological phase. Understanding the microscopic nature of such quantum spin "lake" states and their relationship to equilibrium spin liquid order remains an essential question. Here, we extend the use of approximately symmetric neural quantum states for real-time evolution and directly simulate the dynamical preparation in systems of up to $N=384$ atoms. We analyze a variety of spin liquid diagnostics as a function of the preparation protocol and optimize the extent of the quantum spin lake thus obtained. In the optimal case, the prepared state shows spin-liquid properties extending over half the system size, with a topological entanglement entropy plateauing close to $\gamma = \ln 2$. We extract two physical length scales $\lambda$ and $\xi$ which constrain the extent of the quantum spin lake $\ell$ from above and below.

Title: Contrast transfer functions help quantify neural network out-of-distribution generalization in HRTEM
Authors: Luis Rangel DaCosta, Mary C. Scott
Abstract: Neural networks, while effective for tackling many challenging scientific tasks, are not known to perform well out-of-distribution (OOD), i.e., within domains which differ from their training data. Understanding neural network OOD generalization is paramount to their successful deployment in experimental workflows, especially when ground-truth knowledge about the experiment is hard to establish or experimental conditions significantly vary. With inherent access to ground-truth information and fine-grained control of underlying distributions, simulation-based data curation facilitates precise investigation of OOD generalization behavior. Here, we probe generalization with respect to imaging conditions of neural network segmentation models for high-resolution transmission electron microscopy (HRTEM) imaging of nanoparticles, training and measuring the OOD generalization of over 12,000 neural networks using synthetic data generated via random structure sampling and multislice simulation. Using the HRTEM contrast transfer function, we further develop a framework to compare information content of HRTEM datasets and quantify OOD domain shifts. We demonstrate that neural network segmentation models enjoy significant performance stability, but will smoothly and predictably worsen as imaging conditions shift from the training distribution. Lastly, we consider limitations of our approach in explaining other OOD shifts, such as of the atomic structures, and discuss complementary techniques for understanding generalization in such settings.

Title: Solvent-Directed Femtosecond Laser Ablation: Tuning Phase and Defect Engineering in Hybrid CdPS3/CdS Nanostructures
Authors: Andrei Ushkov, Nadezhda Belozerova, Gleb Tikhonowski, Stepan Klimov, Alexander Syuy, Sergey V. Bazhenov, Sergey Novikov, Vladimir G. Leiman, Aleksey Arsenin, Gleb I. Tselikov, Valentyn Volkov
Abstract: The limited visible-light absorption of wide-bandgap van der Waals crystals fundamentally restricts their utility in solar energy conversion. Here, we report a surfactant-free, solvent-directed laser synthesis strategy to engineer the phase and optoelectronic properties of Cadmium Phosphorus Trisulfide (CdPS3). By exploiting the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of femtosecond pulsed laser ablation in liquid (fs-PLAL), we demonstrate a tunable transition from the stoichiometric ternary phase to a highly active binary-rich heterostructure. While ablation in water preserves the monoclinic CdPS3 lattice, the reducing environment of isopropanol triggers the formation of CdS quantum dots and metallic cadmium defect sites. This solvent-induced phase engineering transforms the ultraviolet-active host into a robust visible-light photocatalyst. The resulting hybrid CdPS3/CdS nanocolloids exhibit superior charge separation efficiency, driven by Schottky-like metal-semiconductor junctions, achieving ~ 90% degradation of Methylene Blue under 532 nm irradiation within 30 minutes. This work establishes fs-PLAL as a scalable defect-engineering tool for complex ternary layered materials, offering a new design of high-performance metal-thiophosphate-based photocatalysts.

Title: Binding Kinetics Oppositely Regulates type II Topoisomerase Relaxation and Decatenation Activities
Authors: Cleis Battaglia, Filippo Conforto, Yair Augusto Gutierrez Fosado, Matt Newton, Erin Cutts, Davide Michieletto, Antonio Valdes
Abstract: Type II Topoisomerases (topo II) are critical to simplify genome topology during transcription and replication. They identify topological problems and resolve them by passing a double-stranded DNA segment through a transient break in another segment. The precise mechanisms underpinning topo IIs ability to maintain a topologically simple genome are not fully understood. Here, we investigate how binding kinetics affects the resolution of two distinct forms of topological entanglement: decatenation and torsional relaxation. First, by single-molecule measurements, we quantify how monovalent cation concentration affects the dissociation rate of topo II from DNA. Second, we discover that increasing dissociation rates accelerate decatenation while slowing down relaxation catalytic activities. Finally, by using molecular dynamics simulations, we uncover that this opposite behaviour is due to a trade-off between search of target through facilitated diffusion and processivity of the enzyme in catenated versus supercoiled DNA. Thus, our findings reveal that a modulation of topo II binding kinetics can oppositely regulate its topological simplification activity, and in turn can have a significant impact in vivo.

Title: Activation of Polylactic Acid and Polycarbonate Surfaces with Non-Thermal Plasma
Authors: Jairo Rondón, Ginger Urrutia, Angel Gonzalez-Lizardo
Abstract: Non-thermal plasma (NTP) surface activation has become a powerful and versatile strategy to engineer the interfacial properties of biomedical polymers whose intrinsic hydrophobicity limits their biological performance. In polymers such as polylactic acid (PLA) and polycarbonate (PC), NTP promotes the controlled incorporation of polar functional groups, increases surface energy, modifies dielectric behavior, and generates micro-roughness that collectively enhance protein adsorption and early cell adhesion. This review synthesizes and critically evaluates evidence across four complementary analytical pillars-contact-angle theory, dielectric impedance spectroscopy, FT-IR chemical mapping, and optical microscopy-to construct an integrated framework for interpreting plasma-induced chemical and morphological transformations. The convergence of multimodal results demonstrates that NTP consistently produces chemically active, polar, and moderately textured surfaces that support robust initial cell-material interactions. Furthermore, combining wettability, dielectric, and spectroscopic analysis enables the identification of activation pathways, the assessment of hydrophobic recovery dynamics, and the development of quantitative correlations between dielectric parameters and biological response. However, the literature also reveals key methodological gaps, including the limited use of unified multimodal protocols, insufficient evaluation of temporal stability, and a lack of predictive dielectric-biological models. By articulating these advances and limitations within a unified conceptual scheme, this review provides a roadmap for future research aimed at standardizing characterization workflows and enabling the rational design of next-generation plasma-functionalized biomaterials for tissue-engineering scaffolds, implantable devices, and advanced drug-delivery systems.

Title: Ionic Disorder-Mediated Exfoliation and Optical Birefringence in a Non-van der Waals Oxide
Authors: N. V. Pak, M. K. Tatmyshevskiy, I. A. Kruglov, K. V. Kravtsov, A. A. Minnekhanov, D. V. Grudinin, A. N. Toksumakov, A. S. Slavich, D. I. Yakubovsky, A. A. Vyshnevyy, M. A. El-Sayed, G. A. Ermolaev, A. V. Arsenin, V. S. Volkov
Abstract: The landscape of two-dimensional photonics has been dominated by van der Waals (vdW) materials. Expanding this library to include non-vdW layered systems promises enhanced environmental robustness and access to novel functionalities, such as strong ionic conductivity, yet their exfoliation remains challenging. Here, we establish Na2Zn2TeO6 (NZTO), a P2-type superionic conductor, as an exfoliable non-vdW optical material. We demonstrate that the highly disordered, mobile Na+ interlayer inherently facilitates mechanical cleavage down to few-nanometer thicknesses (about 4 nm). Optical interrogation via spectroscopic ellipsometry reveals NZTO as a wide-bandgap dielectric with pronounced optical birefringence (Delta_n about 0.25) across the visible and near-infrared spectrum. The lattice dynamics, probed by temperature-resolved Raman spectroscopy, underscore the rigidity of the [Zn2TeO6]2- framework, which remains largely decoupled from the high ionic mobility. These results identify NZTO as a compelling platform for robust, anisotropic dielectric photonics, simultaneously opening a pathway toward the convergence of ionic transport and optical control - an emerging paradigm we term iono-photonics.

Title: Scalable van der Waals Photonics: High-Refractive-Index Gallium Sulfide Films with Single-Crystal Optical Properties

Novikov, Andrey Vyshnevyy, Aleksey Arsenin, Valentyn Volkov
Abstract: The integration of high-refractive-index dielectrics into scalable photonic architectures is foundational to advancing integrated circuits and augmented reality (AR) displays. Van der Waals (vdW) materials offer exceptional optical properties, including high refractive indices and giant anisotropy, but their implementation is constrained by the small area and uncontrolled thickness of mechanically exfoliated flakes. Here, we demonstrate that atomic layer deposition (ALD) grown gallium sulfide (GaS) overcomes the trade-off between high optical performance and manufacturability, emerging as a large-scale vdW dielectric platform. Through rigorous optical and structural benchmarking against pristine single crystals, we establish that the optical constants (n, k) of ALD-GaS are virtually indistinguishable from single-crystal counterparts. By leveraging the retained out-of-plane anisotropy, we demonstrate that ALD-GaS enables superior suppression of crosstalk in densely integrated waveguides compared to conventional scalable high-index platforms. Our findings establish ALD-GaS as a technologically viable pathway for implementing anisotropic vdW materials in visible-spectrum photonics.

Title: Functional Percolation: A Perspective on Criticality of Form and Function
Authors: Galen J. Wilkerson
Abstract: Understanding the physical constraints and minimal conditions that enable information processing in extended systems remains a central challenge across disciplines, from neuroscience and artificial intelligence to social and physical networks. Here we study how network connectivity both limits and enables information processing by analyzing random networks across the structural percolation transition. Using cascade-mediated dynamics as a minimal and universal mechanism for propagating state-dependent responses, we examine structural, functional, and information-theoretic observables as functions of mean degree in Erdos-Renyi networks. We find that the emergence of a giant connected component coincides with a sharp transition in realizable information processing: complex input-output response functions become accessible, functional diversity increases rapidly, output entropy rises, and directed information flow quantified by transfer entropy extends beyond local neighborhoods. These coincident transitions define a regime of functional percolation, referring to a sharp expansion of the space of realizable input-output functions at the structural percolation transition. Near criticality, networks exhibit a Pareto-optimal tradeoff between functional complexity and diversity, suggesting that percolation criticality provides a universal organizing principle for information processing in systems with local interactions and propagating influences.

Title: Meta-learning three-factor plasticity rules for structured credit assignment with sparse feedback
Authors: Dimitra Maoutsa
Abstract: Biological neural networks learn complex behaviors from sparse, delayed feedback using local synaptic plasticity, yet the mechanisms enabling structured credit assignment remain elusive. In contrast, artificial recurrent networks solving similar tasks typically rely on biologically implausible global learning rules or hand-crafted local updates. The space of local plasticity rules capable of supporting learning from delayed reinforcement remains largely unexplored. Here, we present a meta-learning framework that discovers local learning rules for structured credit assignment in recurrent networks trained with sparse feedback. Our approach interleaves local neo-Hebbian-like updates during task execution with an outer loop that optimizes plasticity parameters via \textbf{tangent-propagation through learning}. The resulting three-factor learning rules enable long-timescale credit assignment using only local information and delayed rewards, offering new insights into biologically grounded mechanisms for learning in recurrent circuits.

Title: Optimizing Data Extraction from Materials Science Literature: A Study of Tools Using Large Language Models
Authors: Wenkai Ning, Musen Li, Jeffrey R. Reimers, Rika Kobayashi
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly utilized for large-scale extraction and organization of unstructured data owing to their exceptional Natural Language Processing (NLP) capabilities. Empowering materials design, vast amounts of data from experiments and simulations are scattered across numerous scientific publications, but high-quality experimental databases are scarce. This study considers the effectiveness and practicality of five representative AI tools (ChemDataExtractor, BERT-PSIE, ChatExtract, LangChain, and Kimi) to extract bandgaps from 200 randomly selected Materials Science publications in two presentations (arXiv and publisher versions), comparing the results to those obtained by human processing. Although the integrity of data extraction has not met expectations, encouraging results have been achieved in terms of precision and the ability to eliminate irrelevant papers from human consideration. Our analysis highlights both the strengths and limitations of these tools, offering insights into improving future data extraction techniques for enhanced scientific discovery and innovation. In conjunction with recent research, we provide guidance on feasible improvements for future data extraction methodologies, helping to bridge the gap between unstructured scientific data and structured, actionable databases.

Title: Deep learning of committor for ion dissociation and interpretable analysis of solvent effects using atom-centered symmetry functions
Authors: Kenji Okada, Kazushi Okada, Kei-ichi Okazaki, Toshifumi Mori, Kang Kim, Nobuyuki Matubayasi
Abstract: The association and dissociation of ion pairs in water are fundamental to physical chemistry, yet their reaction coordinates are complex, involving not only interionic distance but also solvent-mediated hydration structures. These processes are often represented by free-energy landscapes constructed from collective variables (CVs), such as interionic distance and water bridging structures; however, it remains uncertain whether such representations reliably capture the transition pathways between the two associated and dissociated states. In this study, we employ deep learning to identify reaction coordinates for NaCl ion pair association and dissociation in water, using the committor as a quantitative measure of progress along the transition pathway through the transition state. The solvent environment surrounding the ions is encoded through descriptors based on atom-centered symmetry functions (ACSFs), which serve as input variables for the neural network. In addition, an explainable artificial intelligence technique is applied to identify ACSFs that contribute to the reaction coordinate. A comparative analysis of their correlation with CVs representing water bridging structures, such as interionic water density and the number of water molecules coordinating both ions, further provides a molecular-level interpretation of the ion association-dissociation mechanism in water.

Title: Advanced microwave SQUID multiplexer model incorporating readout power effects and Josephson junction inhomogeneities
Authors: Martin Neidig, Mathias Wegner, Sebastian Kempf
Abstract: We present an advanced model for describing the readout power dependence of the resonance characteristics of a microwave SQUID multiplexer. Our model proves valid for SQUID screening parameters up to $\beta_\mathrm{L}<1$, hence covering the full range of practically relevant design parameters. We demonstrate that our model significantly improves agreement with experimental data compared to the existing models, thereby enabling optimization beyond the previously accessible parameter space. Moreover, our model supports non-sinusoidal current-phase relations of the rf-SQUID's Josephson junction, allowing, for the first time, for the modeling of devices based on Josephson tunnel junctions with inhomogeneous tunnel barriers. We show that the effects of such inhomogeneities are qualitatively similar to, yet distinct from, those of the screening parameter, making their inclusion essential for accurate characterization. Incorporating these effects yields great improved agreement with measurements, even at readout power conditions well beyond typical operating parameters.

Title: Three-body interaction in a magnon-Andreev-superconducting qubit system: collapse-revival phenomena and entanglement redistribution
Authors: Sheng Zhao, Peng-Bo Li
Abstract: Three-body interactions are fundamental for realizing novel quantum phenomena beyond pairwise physics, yet their implementation -- particularly among distinct quantum systems -- remains challenging. Here, we propose a hybrid quantum architecture comprising a magnonic mode (in a YIG sphere), an Andreev spin qubit (ASQ), and a superconducting qubit (SCQ), to realize a strong three-body interaction at the single-quantum level. Leveraging the spin-dependent supercurrent and circuit-integration flexibility of the ASQ, it is possible to engineer a strong tripartite coupling that jointly excites both qubits upon magnon annihilation (or excites magnons and SCQs upon ASQ deexcitation). Through analytical and numerical studies, we demonstrate that this interaction induces synchronized collapse and revival in qubit populations when the magnon is initially prepared in a coherent state. Notably, during the collapse region -- where populations remain static -- the entanglement structure undergoes a dramatic and continuous reorganization. We show that the genuine tripartite entanglement is redistributed into bipartite entanglement between the two qubits, and vice versa, with the total entanglement conserved. These phenomena, unattainable via two-body couplings, underscore the potential of three-body interactions for exploring intrinsically new quantum effects and advancing hybrid quantum information platforms.

Title: Quantum error correction via purification using a single auxiliary
Authors: Chandrima B. Pushpan, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De, Amit Kumar Pal
Abstract: We propose a single auxiliary-assisted purification-based framework for quantum error correction, capable of correcting errors that drive a system from its ground-state subspace into excited-state sectors. The protocol consists of a joint time evolution of the system-auxiliary duo under a specially engineered interaction Hamiltonian, followed by a single measurement of the auxiliary in its energy eigenbasis and a subsequent post-selection of one of the measurement outcomes. We show that the resulting purified state always achieves unit fidelity, while the probability of obtaining any energy of the auxiliary other than its ground state energy yields the success rate of the protocol. We demonstrate the power of this proposed method for several low-distance quantum codes, including the three-, four-, and five-qubit codes, and for the one-dimensional isotropic Heisenberg model, subjected to bit-flip, phase-flip, and amplitude-damping noises acting on all qubits. Notably, the protocol expands the class of correctable errors for a given code, particularly in the presence of amplitude-damping noise. We further analyze the impact of replacing the auxiliary qudit with a single auxiliary qubit, and the changes in the performance of the protocol under the realistic scenario where noise remains active during the correction cycle.

Title: Frequency-Dependent Polarization Propagator Calculation for Quantum Dots Using Optimized Inverse Krylov Subspace and Folded-Spectrum Method
Authors: Chandler Martin, Nicole Spanedda, Anaira Jalan, Emily Schafer, Jessica Beyer, Arindam Chakraborty
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the frequency response of quantum dots under electromagnetic radiation is essential for investigating absorption spectra, excitonic effects, and nonlinear optical behavior in quantum dots and semiconductor nanoparticles. The polarization propagator provides a rigorous framework for evaluating these properties, but its construction is computationally demanding. Challenges arise from the level of electron correlation, the size of the excitonic basis, and the cost of evaluating two-electron integrals. This work addresses these difficulties by developing first- and second-order frequency-dependent polarization propagator calculations for PbS and CdS quantum dots. The propagator is formulated using the electron propagator approach and expressed as the resolvent of the Hamiltonian superoperator. Light-matter interaction is treated using the dipole approximation and represented in a particle-hole excitation operator basis. The correlated ground state is treated at the MP2 level, and all response-matrix terms up to second order in the fluctuating potential are included. A frequency-dependent inverse Krylov subspace method is derived and combined with the folded-spectrum technique to isolate excitation energies within a chosen frequency window. This strategy avoids full diagonalization of the response matrix and significantly reduces computational cost for large systems. The method is implemented in a matrix-free manner in which no explicit response matrix is assembled, and all operations rely on matrix-vector products. UV-VIS excitation spectra of PbS and CdS quantum dots were computed, demonstrating that the inverse Krylov subspace projection approach provides an efficient and accurate approximation for excitation spectra when full diagonalization is computationally prohibitive.

Title: Tomographic characterization of non-Hermitian Hamiltonians in reciprocal space
Authors: Francesco Di Colandrea, Fabrizio Pavan, Sarvesh Bansal, Paola Savarese, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Carmine Antonio Perroni, Donato Farina, Filippo Cardano
Abstract: Non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enrich quantum physics by extending conventional phase diagrams, enabling novel topological phenomena, and realizing exceptional points with potential applications in quantum sensing. Here, we present an experimental photonic platform capable of simulating a non-unitary quantum walk generated by a peculiar type of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, largely unexplored in the literature. The novelty of this platform lies in its direct access to the reciprocal space, which enables us to scan the quasi-momentum across the entire Brillouin zone and thus achieve a precise tomographic reconstruction of the underlying non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, indicated by the comparison between theoretical predictions and experimental measurements. From the inferred Hamiltonian, it is possible to retrieve complex-valued band structures, resolve exceptional points in momentum space, and detect the associated parity-time symmetry breaking through eigenvector coalescence. Our results, presented entirely in quasi-momentum space, represent a substantial shift in perspective in the study of non-Hermitian phenomena.

Title: Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Gating-Induced Resistance Transition in Charge Density Wave Insulators
Authors: Sheng Zhang, Yunhao Fan, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We present a comprehensive numerical investigation of the gate-induced insulator-to-metal transition in the charge-density-wave (CDW) phase of the Holstein model. Large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations are performed, in which the forces acting on the lattice degrees of freedom are evaluated using the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism. We demonstrate that the onset of CDW instability requires a threshold bias voltage set by the energy of in-gap edge modes. At sufficiently large voltages, the system undergoes an abrupt transition to a metallic state, reminiscent of dielectric breakdown. In the intermediate-voltage regime, our simulations reveal that the transition to a low-resistance state is initiated by the nucleation of a thin conducting layer at the gated electrode. The resulting metal-insulator interface subsequently propagates across the system under the applied bias, leading to the growth of a metallic domain. We further analyze the voltage- and temperature-dependent dynamics of the associated domain walls.

Title: Spin excitation continuum to topological magnon crossover and thermal Hall conductivity in Kitaev magnets
Authors: Emily Z. Zhang, Reja H. Wilke, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: There has been great interest in identifying a Kitaev quantum spin liquid state in frustrated magnets with bond-dependent interactions. In particular, the experimental report of a half-quantized thermal Hall conductivity in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ in the presence of a magnetic field has generated excitement as it could be strong evidence for a field-induced chiral spin liquid. More recent experiments, however, provide a conflicting interpretation advocating for topological magnons in the field-polarized state as the origin of the non-quantized thermal Hall conductivity observed in their experiments. An inherent difficulty in distinguishing between the two scenarios is the phase transition between a putative two-dimensional spin liquid and the field-polarized state exists only at zero temperature, while the behaviour at finite temperature is mostly crossover phenomena. In this work, we provide insights into the finite temperature crossover behavior between the spin excitation continuum in a quantum spin liquid and topological magnons in the field-polarized state in three different theoretical models with large Kitaev interactions. These models allow for a field-induced phase transition from a spin liquid (or an intermediate field-induced spin liquid) to the field-polarized state in the quantum model. We obtain the dynamical spin structure factor as a function of magnetic field using molecular dynamics simulations and compute thermal Hall conductivity in the field-polarized regime. We demonstrate the gradual evolution of the dynamical spin structure factor exhibiting crossover behaviour near magnetic fields where zero-temperature phase transitions occur in the quantum model. We also examine nonlinear effects on topological magnons and the validity of thermal Hall conductivity computed using linear spin wave theory. We discuss the implications of our results to existing and future experiments.

Abstract: We highlight the importance of long-range correlations in active matter systems of self-propelling particles even in the absence of global order or steric interactions by demonstrating that long-range density fluctuations are reduced. We show this analytically for a one-dimensional lattice process employing a Poisson representation. Within this framework, we are able to derive the fluctuating hydrodynamics for the Poisson fields. The emergent imaginary noise indicates the non-Poissonian nature of the number fluctuations and manifests in a non-trivial structure factor $S(k)$ which we are computing analytically. Numerically, we corroborate the relevance of these findings for off-lattice Vicsek-type models with anti-aligning interactions for which we observe apparent non-universal hyperuniformity which we suggest to interpret as a reduction with integer power-law to a finite value.

Title: Disentangling spin excitation continua in classical and quantum magnets using 2D nonlinear spectroscopy
Authors: Emily Z. Zhang, Ciarán Hickey, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) has traditionally been one of the primary methods for investigating quantum magnets, particularly in identifying a continuum of excitations as a hallmark of spin fractionalization in quantum spin liquids (QSLs). However, INS faces severe limitations due to its inability to distinguish between such QSL signatures and similar excitation continua arising from highly frustrated magnetic orders with large unit cells or classical spin liquids. In contrast, two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) has emerged as a powerful tool to probe nonlinear excitation dynamics, offering insights into the underlying mechanisms behind these broad spectral features. In this paper, we utilize classical molecular dynamics (MD) techniques to explore the 2DCS responses of frustrated magnets with dominant Kitaev interactions. Comparing the classical and quantum versions of the pure Kitaev model our results indicate both clear similarities, in the form of sharp line features, and clear distinctions, in the locations of these features and in selection rules. Moreover, in the extended $K\Gamma\Gamma'$ model, we show that the 2DCS response of the Kitaev spin liquid is completely distinct from that of large unit cell magnetic orders, despite both generating a broad continuum in INS. Additionally, we demonstrate the extreme sensitivity of classical 2DCS to thermal fluctuations and discuss the potential significance of quantum coherence in experimental settings. Overall, our work illustrates the potential of 2DCS in resolving the complex physics underlying ambiguous spin excitation continua, thereby enhancing our understanding of the dynamics in these frustrated systems.

Title: Stress Isotropization in Weakly Jammed Granular Packings
Authors: Félix Benoist, Mehdi Bouzid, Martin Lenz
Abstract: When sheared, granular media experience localized plastic events known as shear transformations which generate anisotropic internal stresses. Under strong confining pressure, the response of granular media to local force multipoles is essentially linear, resulting in quadrupolar propagated stresses. This can lead to additional plastic events along the direction of relative stress increase. Closer to the unjamming transition however, as the confining pressure and the shear modulus vanish, nonlinearities become relevant. Yet, the consequences of these nonlinearities on the stress response to plastic events remains poorly understood. We show with granular dynamics simulations that this brings about an isotropization of the propagated stresses, in agreement with a previously developed continuum elastic model. This could significantly modify the yielding transition of weakly-jammed amorphous media, which has been conceptualized as an avalanche of such plastic events.

Title: Majorana edge and end states in planar Josephson junctions
Authors: A. P. Garrido, P. A. Orellana, A. Matos-Abiague
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the localization properties of Majorana states (MSs) in proximitized, planar Josephson Junctions (JJs) oriented along different crystallographic orientations and in the presence of an in-plane magnetic field and Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit couplings. We show that two types of MSs may emerge when the junction transits into the topological superconducting state. In one case, referred to as end-like MSs, the Majorana quasiparticles are mainly localized inside the normal region at the opposite ends of the junction. In contrast, edge-like MSs extend along the opposite edges of the system, perpendicular to the junction channel. We show how the MSs can transit from end-like to edge-like and vice versa by tuning the magnetic field strength and/or the superconducting phase difference across the junction. In the case of phase-unbiased JJs the transition may occur as the ground state phase difference self-adjusts its value when the Zeeman field is varied. We propose exploiting the extended nature of edge-like MSs as effective interconnects enabling the coupling between topological states in adjacent planar JJs. The impact of electrostatic disorder on the MSs is also analyzed.

Title: Integrating Deep-Learning-Based Magnetic Model and Non-Collinear Spin-Constrained Method: Methodology, Implementation and Application
Authors: Daye Zheng, Xingliang Peng, Yike Huang, Yinan Wang, Duo Zhang, Zhengtao Huang, Zefeng Cai, Linfeng Zhang, Mohan Chen, Ben Xu, Weiqing Zhou
Abstract: We propose a non-collinear spin-constrained method that generates training data for deep-learning-based magnetic model, which provides a powerful tool for studying complex magnetic phenomena that requires large-scale simulations at the atomic level. First, we propose a basis-independent projection method for calculating atomic magnetic moments by applying a radial truncation to numerical atomic orbitals. A double-loop Lagrange multiplier method is utilized to ensure the satisfaction of constraint conditions while achieving accurate magnetic torque. The method is implemented in ABACUS with both plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbital basis. We benchmark the iron (Fe) systems and analyze differences from calculations with the plane wave basis and numerical atomic orbitals basis in describing magnetic energy barriers. Based on an automated workflow composed of first-principles calculations, magnetic model, active learning, and dynamics simulation, more than 30,000 first-principles data with the information of magnetic torque are generated to train a deep-learning-based magnetic model DeePSPIN for the Fe system. By utilizing the model in large-scale molecular dynamics simulations, we successfully predict Curie temperatures of alpha-Fe close to experimental values.

Title: Magnetic-Field and Strain Engineering of Modulated Transverse Transport in Altermagnetic Topological Materials
Authors: Xiuxian Yang, Xiaodong Zhou, Jingming Shi, Shifeng Qian, Xiaotian Wang, Wenhong Wang, Yinwei Li
Abstract: Here, we explore the role of inherent altermagnetic topology in transverse transport phenomena (such as crystal/anomalous Hall, Nernst, and thermal Hall effects) in several famous altermagnets, including tetragonal \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O (\textit{X} = K, Rb, Cs; \textit{Y} = S, Se, Te), RuO$_2$, MnF$_2$, as well as hexagonal CrSb and MnTe. Notably, in \textit{X}V$_2$\textit{Y}$_2$O, the first experimentally realized layered altermagnets, transverse transport is governed by altermagnetic pseudonodal surfaces, emphasizing the purely topological contributions to transverse transport. Interestingly, we demonstrate that strain engineering and magnetic field, two unique methods for selectively controlling crystal and anomalous transport, can substantially enhance the magnitude of these phenomena while preserving the alternating spin characteristics in both real and momentum space. Moreover, due to the spin symmetry breaking via shear strain, a new magnetic phase, fully compensated ferrimagnetism, with isotropic spin splitting, can be induced. Our findings provide effective strategies not only for manipulating transverse transport in altermagnets but also for controlling magnetic phase transitions, offering valuable insights for their potential applications in spintronics and spin caloritronics.

Title: First passage time properties of diffusion with a broad class of stochastic diffusion coefficients
Authors: Go Uchida, Hiromi Miyoshi, Hitoshi Washizu
Abstract: Diffusion in a heterogeneous environment or diffusion of a particle that shows conformational fluctuations can be described by Brownian motions with stochastic diffusion coefficients (sDCs). In this study, we investigate first passage time (FPT) properties of diffusion with a broad class of non-zero sDCs. We show that for diffusion in one-dimensional semi-infinite domain with an absorbing boundary, particles will eventually reach the boundary with probability one, and that diffusion with a sDC exhibits higher transport efficiency in an early arrival of particles at the boundary than would be expected under diffusion whose DC is the ensemble average (EA) of the sDC. When particles begin to reach an absorbing boundary before the change in a sDC occurs, diffusion with a sDC with a larger supremum exhibits a more efficient transport in an early arrival of particles at the boundary even if the EAs of sDCs are the same. For ergodic DCs, the mean FPT is infinite. In addition, if particles take a long time to reach an absorbing boundary, higher transport efficiency in an early arrival at the boundary almost disappears and the FPT distribution can be approximated by the Lévy-Smirnov distribution. We show that these three properties result from the convergence of the time average of the DC to the EA and the convergence speed is determined by the time scale of fluctuations in the DC. We finally discuss the similarities and differences of FPT properties between three-dimensional diffusion outside a spherical absorbing boundary and the one-dimensional diffusion. Our results indicate that fluctuations in DCs may need to be non-Markov and/or non-ergodic to allow efficient transport of particles to distant targets. Our results also suggest that fluctuations in a DC play an important role, for example, in diffusion-limited reactions triggered by single molecules in physics, chemistry, or biology.

Title: Pre-training, fine-tuning, and distillation (PFD): Automatically generating machine learning force fields from universal models
Authors: Ruoyu Wang, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD (Pre-training, Fine-tuning, and Distillation), which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems, such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.

Title: Absence of transport altermagnetic spin-splitting effect in RuO2
Authors: Yu-Chun Wang, Zhe-Yu Shen, Chia-Hsi Lin, Wei-Chih Hsu, You-Sheng Chen, Yi-Ying Chin, Akhilesh Kr. Singh, Wei-Li Lee, Chien-Te Chen, Ssu-Yen Huang, Danru Qu
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit the advantages of both antiferromagnets and ferromagnets, have attracted significant attention recently. Among them, ruthenium dioxide (RuO2), a prototypical altermagnet candidate, is under intensive debate on its magnetic order and altermagnetic characters. In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of the spin-to-charge conversion in epitaxial RuO2 thin films with various orientations and fabrication methods. By utilizing thermal spin injections from a ferrimagnetic insulator, we unambiguously reveal a negative spin Hall angle for RuO2, which is opposite to all the previous reports using ferromagnetic metals. Most importantly, we observe robust anisotropic spin-to-charge conversion in RuO2, with voltage ratios of 30% for the (100)- and (110)-orientations and 40% for the (101)-orientations. The ratio remains consistent across RuO2 films fabricated by sputtering, pulsed laser deposition, and molecular-beam epitaxy. These results conclusively show a robust and anisotropic spin Hall effect in RuO2 with the absence of altermagnetic spin-splitting contributions. Our study provides crucial insights and advances the understanding of spin-to-charge conversions in emerging materials with low crystal symmetries.

Title: Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD
Authors: Vladimir M. Kaganer, Domenik Spallek, Philipp John, Oliver Brandt, Jonas Lähnemann
Abstract: Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of $5\times10^{8}$ cm$^{-2}$ and $1.8\times10^{10}$ cm$^{-2}$ by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (HR-EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and HR-EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is modeled by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The HR-EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. The kink in the plot of the autocorrelation function allows a robust and accurate determination of the screening distance without making any simulation or fit. Screening distances of 2 $\mu$m and 0.3 $\mu$m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the HR-EBSD measurements is observed and quantified. In this version, an error in the processing of the HR-EBSD maps of the Si wafer is specified.

Title: Phase Transformation Kinetics Model for Metals
Authors: Daniel N. Blaschke, Abigail Hunter, Dean L. Preston
Abstract: We develop a new model for phase transformation kinetics in metals by generalizing the Levitas-Preston (LP) phase field model of martensite phase transformations (see Levitas and Preston (2002a,b); Levitas, Preston and Lee (2003)) to arbitrary pressure. Furthermore, we account for and track: the interface speed of the pressure driven phase transformation, properties of critical nuclei, as well as nucleation at grain sites and on dislocations and homogeneous nucleation. The volume fraction evolution of each phase is described by employing KJMA (Kolmogorov, 1937; Johnson and Mehl, 1939; Avrami, 1939, 1940, 1941) kinetic theory. We then test our new model for iron under ramp loading conditions and compare our predictions for the $\alpha\to\epsilon$ iron phase transition to experimental data of Smith et al. (2013). More than one combination of material and model parameters (such as dislocation density and interface speed) led to good agreement of our simulations to the experimental data, thus highlighting the importance of having accurate characterization data for the microstructure of the sample under consideration.

Title: Projectively implemented altermagnetism in an exactly solvable quantum spin liquid
Authors: Avedis Neehus, Achim Rosch, Johannes Knolle, Urban F. P. Seifert
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of symmetry-compensated magnets with large spin splittings. Here, we show that the notion of altermagnetism extends beyond the realm of Landau-type order: we study exactly solvable $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin(-orbital) liquids (QSL), which simultaneously support magnetic long-range order as well as fractionalization and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. Our symmetry analysis reveals that in this model three distinct types of ``fractionalized altermagnets (AM$^*$)'' may emerge, which can be distinguished by their residual symmetries. Importantly, the fractionalized excitations of these states carry an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charge, which implies that they transform \emph{projectively} under symmetry operations. Consequently, we show that ``altermagnetic spin splittings'' are now encoded in a momentum-dependent particle-hole asymmetry of the fermionic parton bands. We discuss consequences for experimental observables such as dynamical spin structure factors and (nonlinear) thermal and spin transport.

Title: Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses
Authors: Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical 3+4-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for \emph{strong ergodicity breaking} in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed $p$-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics take place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.

Title: Optically induced magnetic inertia and magnons from non-Markovian extension of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation
Authors: Felipe Reyes-Osorio, Branislav K. Nikolic
Abstract: The Landau-Lisfhitz-Gilbert (LLG) equation has been the cornerstone of modeling the dynamics of localized spins, viewed as classical vectors of fixed length, within nonequilibrium magnets. When light is employed as the nonequilibrium drive, the LLG equation must be supplemented with additional terms that are usually conjectured using phenomenological arguments for direct opto-magnetic coupling between localized spins and (real or effective) magnetic field of light. However, direct coupling of magnetic field to spins is 1/c smaller than coupling of light and electrons; or both magnetic and electric fields are too fast for slow classical spins to be able to follow them. Here, we displace the need for phenomenological arguments by rigorously deriving an extended LLG equation via Schwinger-Keldysh field theory (SKFT). Within such a theory, light interacts with itinerant electrons, and then spin current carried by them exerts spin-transfer torque onto localized spins, so that when photoexcited electrons are integrated out we arrive at a spin-only equation. Unlike the standard phenomenological LLG equation with local-in-time Gilbert damping, our extended one contains a non-Markovian memory kernel whose plot within the plane of its two times variables exhibits fractal properties. By applying SKFT-derived extended LLG equation, as our central result, to a light-driven ferromagnet as an example, we predict an optically induced magnetic inertia term. Its magnitude is governed by spatially nonlocal and time-dependent prefactor, leading to excitation of coherent magnons at sharp frequencies in and outside of the band of incoherent (or thermal) magnons.

Title: Upper critical field and pairing symmetry of Ising superconductors
Authors: Lena Engström, Ludovica Zullo, Tristan Cren, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_{c2}$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_{c2}$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_{c2}(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we predict a doping-dependent experimental signature of our theory.

Title: Accurate Prediction of Tensorial Spectra Using Equivariant Graph Neural Network
Authors: Ting-Wei Hsu, Zhenyao Fang, Arun Bansil, Qimin Yan
Abstract: Optical spectroscopies provide a powerful tool for harnessing light-matter interactions for unraveling complex electronic features such as the flat bands and nontrivial topologies of materials. These insights are crucial for the development and optimization of optoelectronic devices, including solar cells, light-emitting diodes, and photodetectors, where device performance is closely connected with the nature of the underlying electronic spectrum. Realistic modeling of tensor optical responses in materials, which are computationally quite demanding, however, remains challenging. Here we introduce the Tensorial Spectra Equivariant Neural Network (TSENN), which is a equivariant graph neural network architecture that maps crystal structures directly to their full photon-frequency-dependent optical tensors. By encoding the isotropic sequential scalar components along with the anisotropic sequential tensor components into l = 0 and l = 2 spherical tensor components, TSENN ensures symmetry-aware predictions that are consistent with the constraints of crystalline symmetries of materials. Trained on a dataset of frequency-dependent permittivity tensors of 1,432 bulk semiconductors computed using first-principles methods, our model achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of 21.181 millifarads per meter (mF/m), demonstrating its potential for efficient modeling of other related properties such as the optical conductivities. Our framework opens new avenues for rational data-driven design of anisotropic optical responses for accelerating materials discovery for advancing optoelectronic applications.

Title: Solving the Gross-Pitaevskii Equation with Quantic Tensor Trains: Ground States and Nonlinear Dynamics
Authors: Qian-Can Chen, I-Kang Liu, Jheng-Wei Li, Chia-Min Chung
Abstract: We develop a tensor network framework based on the quantic tensor train (QTT) format to efficiently solve the Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), which governs Bose-Einstein condensates under mean-field theory. By adapting time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) and gradient descent methods, we accurately handle the GPE's nonlinearities within the QTT structure. Our approach enables high-resolution simulations with drastically reduced computational cost. We benchmark ground states and dynamics of BECs--including vortex lattice formation and breathing modes--demonstrating superior performance over conventional grid-based methods and stable long-time evolution due to saturating bond dimensions. This establishes QTT as a powerful tool for nonlinear quantum simulations.

Title: Topological phases of electrons induced by electron-magnon interactions
Authors: Kosuke Fujiwara, Takahiro Morimoto
Abstract: Topological phases of electrons such as topological insulators and quantum Hall states typically require strong spin-orbit coupling or magnetic fields. In this study, we consider an electron system coupled to a spin system, where electrons interact with magnons, quasiparticles of spin waves. We show that the interaction between electrons and magnons transfers the effect of symmetry breaking in the spin system to the electron system, whereby a non-trivial topological phase can be induced in the electron system that is otherwise topologically trivial. Through this ``topology transfer'' mechanism, we demonstrate the realization of various topological phases, including quantum Hall and quantum spin Hall insulators, in simple ferromagnetic spin systems, without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling or external magnetic field for electron systems.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo Simulation of Bipolaron Superconductivity in Extended Hubbard--Holstein models on Face-Centered-Cubic and Body-Centered-Cubic Lattices
Authors: G.D. Adebanjo, J.P. Hague, P.E. Kornilovitch
Abstract: We investigate superlight pairing of bipolarons driven by electron-phonon interactions (EPIs) in face-center-cubic (FCC) and body-center-cubic (BCC) lattices using a continuous-time path-integral quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) algorithm. The EPIs are of the Holstein and extended Holstein types, and a Hubbard interaction is also included. Effects of adiabaticity are calculated. The number of phonons associated with the bipolaron, inverse mass, and radius are calculated and used to construct a phase diagram for bipolaron pairing (identifying the regions of pairing into intersite bipolarons and onsite bipolarons). From the inverse mass we determine that for the extended interaction, there is a region of light pairing associated with intersite bipolarons formed in both BCC and FCC lattices. Intersite bipolarons in the extended model at intermediate phonon frequency and large Coulomb repulsion become superlight due to first order hopping effects. We estimate the transition temperature, determining that intersite bipolarons are associated with regions of high transition temperatures.

Title: Correlation effects in one-dimensional metallic quantum wires under various confinements
Authors: Vidit Gangwar, Vinod Ashokan, Ankush Girdhar, Klaus Morawetz, N. D. Drummond, K. N. Pathak
Abstract: Dynamical response theory is used to investigate various transverse confinements on electron correlations in the ground state of a ferromagnetic one-dimensional quantum wire for different wire widths $b$ and density parameters $r_{\rm s}$. Using the first-order random phase approximation (FRPA), which provides the ground state structure beyond the random phase approximation, we compute the structure factor, pair-correlation function, correlation energy, and ground-state energy. The correlation energy depends on the choice of confinement model and hence effective electron-electron interaction. For the ultrathin wire ($b\rightarrow 0$) in the high-density limit, the correlation energy for transverse confinement models $V_1(q)$ (harmonic), $V_2(q)$ (cylindrical), and $V_5(q)$ (harmonic-delta) approaches $\epsilon_{\rm c}(r_{\rm s})= - \pi^2/360 \sim -0.02741$ a.u., which agrees with the exact results in this limit [J. Chem. Phys. 138, 064108 (2013); Phys. Rev. B 101, 075130 (2020)]. For at least these three confinement potentials, the one-dimensional Coulomb potential can be regularized at interparticle distance $x=0$ to yield the same correlation energy. In contrast, $V_3(q)$ (infinite square well), $V_4(q)$ (infinite square-infinite triangular well), and $V_6(q)$ (infinite square-delta well), do not approach the same high-density limit; instead, the correlation energy tends to $\epsilon_{\rm c} \sim -0.03002$ a.u. The ground-state properties obtained from the FRPA are compared with quantum Monte Carlo results. The peak height in the static structure factor at $k=2k_{\rm F}$ depends significantly on the confinement model. These peaks are fitted with a function based on our finite wire-width theory demonstrating good agreement with FRPA.

Title: Minimising the Demand for High-Fidelity Training Data towards Chemically Accurate Adsorption Energy Predictions
Authors: Zhihao Zhang, Xiao-Ming Cao
Abstract: Adsorption energy is a critical descriptor for high-throughput screening of heterogeneous catalysts and electrode materials. However, precise experimental data are scarce due to the complexity of experiments, while high-fidelity density functional theory (DFT) calculations remain computationally expensive for large-scale material screening. Machine learning models trained on DFT data have emerged as a promising alternative but face challenges such as functional dependency and limited high-fidelity labelled data. Herein, we present DOS Transformer for Adsorption (DOTA), a functional-independent deep learning model established on the map between local density of states (LDOS) and adsorption energy. DOTA integrates multi-head self-attention mechanisms with LDOS feature engineering to capture latent orbital interaction patterns, enabling it to unify multi-fidelity and multi-source data. This minimises the demand for high-fidelity training data. Consequently, the predictive adsorption energy could reach chemical accuracy, requiring less than five high-fidelity experimental adsorption energies for model training. DOTA also resolves long-standing challenges, such as the "CO puzzle", and outperforms traditional theories, including the d-band centre and Fermi softness models. It provides a robust framework for efficient catalyst and electrode screening, bridging the gap between computational and experimental data.

Title: Dynamical signatures and control of time-reversal breaking in twisted nodal superconductors
Authors: Jefferson Tang, Pavel A. Volkov
Abstract: Recent observations of time-reversal breaking superconductivity at twisted cuprate interfaces motivate the development of new approaches to better characterize this emergent phenomenon. Here we study the dynamical properties of the order parameters at the twisted unconventional superconductor interfaces. We reveal the emergence of a soft collective mode (Josephson plasmon) at the time-reversal breaking transition, which can be tuned by temperature, twist angle or magnetic field. Furthermore, nonlinear dynamical responses contain direct signatures of both the transition and the broken symmetry itself. In particular, we show that the generation of a second harmonic voltage under alternating current driving is a necessary and sufficient signature of time-reversal symmetry breaking. Finally, we demonstrate that strong nonlinear driving induces dynamical phase transitions between phases with and without spontaneous symmetry breaking, introducing a tool for their out-of-equilibrium control. We discuss the signatures of our predictions in AC current-driven experiments on twisted Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ interfaces.

Title: Ising spin ladders of orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$
Authors: Pavel A. Maksimov, Andrey F. Gubkin, Alexey V. Ushakov, Alexander I. Kolesnikov, Matthew S. Cook, Michael A. McGuire, Günther J. Redhammer, Andrey Podlesnyak, Sergey V. Streltsov
Abstract: We present thermodynamic and spectroscopic measurements for an orthopyroxene CoGeO$_3$ with magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions that form quasi-one-dimensional ladders. We show that non-collinear magnetic order below $T_N$=32 K can be stabilized by a strong local easy-axis anisotropy of $j_\text{eff}=1/2$ moments, which is induced by ligand octahedra distortions. Extraction of a magnetic Hamiltonian from inelastic neutron scattering measurements supports this interpretation and allows us to establish an effective magnetic model. The resulting exchange Hamiltonian justifies CoGeO$_3$ as a realization of an Ising spin ladder compound.

Title: The non-perturbative sides of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation
Authors: Léonie Canet
Abstract: The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation is a celebrated non-linear stochastic dynamical equation yielding non-equilibrium universal scaling. It exhibits notorious non-perturbative aspects. The KPZ fixed point is strong-coupling, all the more in $d>1$. Strikingly, another, even stronger-coupling fixed point of the KPZ equation, called inviscid Burgers fixed point, has been recently unveiled. These non-pertubative features can be theoretically accessed and studied in a controlled way in all dimensions using the functional renormalisation group. We propose an overview of the related results, which provide a unified picture of the fixed-point structure and associated scaling regimes of the KPZ equation in $d=1$ and in higher dimensions.

Authors: Miuko Tanaka, Abdul Ahad, Darius-Alexandru Deaconu, Varun Shah, Daisuke Nishio-Hamane, Tomohiro Ishii, Masayuki Hashisaka, Shoya Sakamoto, Shinji Miwa, Mohammad Saeed Bahramy, Toshiya Ideue
Abstract: Colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is a fascinating quantum phenomenon that continues to draw significant interest in condensed matter physics. Mn3Si2Te6 has emerged as a prototypical CMR material, notable for its puzzling magnetoresistance behavior and pronounced directional anisotropy. Despite extensive research, the mechanisms driving CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 remain elusive [1-4]. In this work, we explore the magnetic resonance of Mn3Si2Te6 and observe a reduced g-factor for magnetic fields applied along the crystalline c-axis compared to the ab-plane, indicating a substantial orbital magnetization contribution along the c-axis. Furthermore, we detect resistance modulation under resonance conditions, suggesting that CMR in Mn3Si2Te6 is sensitive to the out-of-the plane spin polarization. These findings shed new light on the role of orbital magnetic moment in Mn3Si2Te6, offering a deeper understanding of the interplay between spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom of electrons in this system.

Title: Anisotropic spin fluctuations in the triangular Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$ probed by site-selective $^{27}$Al NMR
Authors: H. Sakai, S. Shin, S. Kambe, Y. Tokunaga, H. Harima, E. Pomjakushina, T. Park
Abstract: A site-selective $^{27}$Al nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) study is carried out on the Kondo lattice compound CePtAl$_4$Ge$_2$, which crystallizes in a rhombohedral lattice with quasi-two-dimensional Ce layers forming a triangular lattice network. Two inequivalent Al sites, Al(1) and Al(2), are unambiguously assigned by comparing measured nuclear quadrupole parameters with electric field gradients obtained from electronic structure calculations. Knight shift analysis yields distinct hyperfine coupling constants, revealing that they arise predominantly from RKKY-type transferred hyperfine fields through conduction electrons. Spin-lattice relaxation measurements reveal pronounced anisotropic spin fluctuations, and comparison of the relaxation rates between the two Al sites clarifies the momentum-space structure of these fluctuations. At low magnetic fields, $(T_1T)^{-1}$ is strongly enhanced on cooling toward the Néel temperature, indicating the growth of in-plane antiferromagnetic correlations in the paramagnetic state.

Title: Engineering spin-wave spectrum via the magnetization inertia tensor
Authors: Subhadip Ghosh, Darpa Narayan Basu, Ritwik Mondal
Abstract: Magnetic inertial dynamics has recently been predicted and experimentally demonstrated in two-sublattice ferromagnets such as CoFeB and NiFe permalloy. In this work, we investigate the spin-wave spectrum of such systems by incorporating the complete magnetic inertia tensor. By decomposing the tensor into symmetric and antisymmetric components, we identify isotropic, anisotropic, and chiral contributions to magnetic inertia. Within linear spin-wave theory, we find that the spectrum comprises two precessional and two inertial magnon bands. Remarkably, the upper precessional band intersects the lower inertial band within the Brillouin zone. Both cross-sublattice and chiral components of the inertia tensor act as effective control parameters for tuning these magnonic band structures. Furthermore, we show that the inertial spin-wave spectrum becomes nonreciprocal along propagation directions where the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is finite. Strikingly, a similar nonreciprocity can also arise purely from chiral inertia, even in the absence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. Our findings establish magnetic inertia as a new pathway to engineer nonreciprocal magnon transport and ultrafast spintronic functionalities.

Title: Self-organized hyperuniformity in a minimal model of population dynamics
Authors: Tal Agranov, Natan Wiegenfeld, Omer Karin, Benjamin D. Simons
Abstract: By generalizing a class of models recently introduced to account for protracted transients in biological systems, we identify a novel mechanism for hyperuniformity. In this model, competition of particles over a shared resource guides the population towards a critical steady state with prolonged individual life time. We show that, in its spatially extended form, this many-particle model exhibits hyperuniform density fluctuations. Through explicit coarse-graining, we develop a hydrodynamic theory that conforms closely with the results of stochastic simulations. Unlike previous models for non-equilibrium hyperuniform states, our model does not exhibit conservation laws, even when approaching criticality. Instead, hyperuniformity arises from the divergence of the interaction range as the system approaches the critical point. These findings may find applications in engineering, cellular population dynamics, and ecology.

Title: Metastable phase separation and information retrieval in multicomponent mixtures
Authors: Rodrigo Braz Teixeira, Izaak Neri, Pablo Sartori
Abstract: Liquid mixtures can separate into phases with distinct composition. This phenomenon has recently come back to prominence due to its role in complex biological liquids, such as the cytoplasm, which contain thousands of components. For simple two-component mixtures phase-separated states are global free energy minima. However, local free energy minima, i.e. metastable states, are known to play a dominant role in complex systems with many components. For example, Hopfield neural networks can retrieve information from partial cues via relaxation to metastable states. Under what conditions can phase separated states be metastable, and what are the implications for information processing in multicomponent liquids? In this work we develop the general thermodynamic formalism of metastable phase separation. We then apply this formalism to an illustrative toy example inspired by recent experiments, binary mixtures with high-order interactions. Finally, as core application of the formalism, we study metastability in Hopfield liquids, a class of multicomponent mixtures capable of storing information on the composition of phases. We show that these phases can be retrieved from partial cues via metastable phase separation. Spatial simulations of liquids with a large number of components match our analytical solution. Our work suggests that complex biological mixtures can perform information retrieval through metastable phase separation.

Title: Development and Validation of Interatomic Potential for Sc and Al-Sc Alloys: Thermodynamics, Solidification, and Intermetallic Ordering
Authors: Avik Mahata
Abstract: We present a second-nearest-neighbor Modified Embedded Atom Method (2NN--MEAM) potential for Scandium (Sc) and Aluminum-Scandium (Al--Sc) alloys that unifies cohesive, thermodynamic, and solidification behavior within a single transferable framework. The Sc component accurately reproduces cohesive energy, lattice constants, defect energetics, and the experimental melting point obtained from two-phase coexistence, demonstrating reliable description of both hcp and liquid phases. The Al--Sc binary interaction parameters were fitted using the L1$_2$--Al$_3$Sc reference and benchmarked against first-principles and calorimetric data. The potential reproduces the strong negative formation enthalpy of Al$_3$Sc (--0.45~eV~atom$^{-1}$), correct relative stability of competing phases, and realistic elastic properties. Mixing enthalpies of the liquid alloy agree with ideal-associated-solution and CALPHAD models, confirming that the potential captures exothermic Al--Sc association in the melt. Molecular-dynamics simulations of solidification reveal the expected temperature and composition dependence of homogeneous nucleation. Pure Al crystallizes readily, while Al--1~at.\%~Sc exhibits a longer incubation and slower growth at the same absolute temperature due to reduced undercooling and solute drag. Within the alloy, ordered Al$_3$Sc-type L1$_2$ embryos appear spontaneously, with Sc atoms occupying cube-corner (B) sites surrounded by twelve Al neighbors. Energy--volume trajectories confirm that the potential links thermodynamics to microstructural evolution. Overall, the developed 2NN--MEAM potential provides a quantitatively grounded basis for modeling melting, solidification, and intermetallic ordering in Sc and Al--Sc systems, enabling future multicomponent alloy design and large-scale nucleation studies.

Title: Néel-Vector-Orientation Induced Intrinsic Half-Metallicity in Two-Dimensional Altermagnets
Authors: Xin Chen, Jin Zou, Lipeng Song, Wei Sun, Yiwen Wu, Luyao Zhu, Xu Cheng, Duo Wang, Biplab Sanyal
Abstract: Whether a zero-moment antiferromagnet can host an intrinsic half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface remains an open question in antiferromagnetic spintronics. Existing proposals in compensated magnets reach only transport analogues of this limit and do not realize a genuine AFM half-metallic ground state with a single-spin Fermi surface. Here we show that in two-dimensional altermagnets the Néel-vector orientation acts as an intrinsic knob for magnetic-space-group reduction that lifts the degeneracy between spin sectors. Using Janus monolayer Ta$_2$TeSeO as a realistic and clean platform and combining symmetry analysis with first-principles calculations, we demonstrate that rotating the Néel vector first breaks the relevant mirror symmetry, opening a gap in one spin sector of symmetry-related Weyl pairs, and then breaks the residual $C_{2z}$ symmetry, shifting the remaining Weyl cones in opposite energy directions so that a single spin sector retains a Fermi surface at the Fermi level. These two symmetry-lowering steps convert a compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetal into an intrinsic AFM half-metal. The nearly degenerate in-plane magnetic anisotropy then enables reversible switching between the two spin channels using minute strain or weak anisotropic fields. Because this mechanism relies solely on Néel-vector-induced symmetry reduction, it provides a general low-power route to intrinsic half-metallicity in compensated altermagnetic Weyl semimetals.

Title: Arrow of Time in Three-Particle System and Its General Origin in Classical and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Shuhei Kobayashi
Abstract: This paper presents a unified formulation of the origin of the arrow of time in classical and quantum mechanics. We begin with a mechanical analysis of a one-dimensional three-particle system, which provides a concrete setting in which macroscopic irreversibility emerges despite microscopically reversible dynamics. By abstracting this mechanism, we show that the breaking of time-reversal symmetry at the macroscopic level arises solely from the non-injective nature of coarse-graining maps. We then formalize this principle in classical mechanics and prove a general noncommutativity theorem: a reversible microscopic time-reversal map T does not commute with a coarse-graining map $\varphi$ whenever $\varphi$ is non-injective. The same mathematical structure extends naturally to quantum mechanics. Using density matrices, anti-unitary time reversal, and CPTP coarse-graining maps, we derive the quantum analogue of the theorem and demonstrate that macroscopic time asymmetry follows inevitably from information loss, without requiring any asymmetry in the underlying microscopic laws. Thus, classical and quantum mechanics share a common mathematical origin of the arrow of time: the loss of microscopic information inherent in coarse-graining.

Title: Challenges in predicting positron annihilation lifetimes in lead halide perovskites: correlation functionals and polymorphism
Authors: Kajal Madaan, Guido Roma, Jasurbek Gulomov, Pascal Pochet, Catherine Corbel, Ilja Makkonen
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged in the last decade as a new important class of semiconductors for a variety of optoelectronic applications. A lot of previous studies were thus devoted to the characterisation of their point defects. Positron annihilation spectroscopy is a well recognized tool for probing vacancies in materials. Recent applications of this technique to APbX$_3$ halide perovskites are sparse, and the rare theoretical predictions of positron lifetimes in these materials, published in association with experiments, do not fully agree with each other. These works suggest that vacancies on the A site are not detected. In our theoretical study we focus on the role of the electron-positron correlation functional. We thoroughly revisit and compare several approximations when applied to methylammonium lead iodide (MAPbI$_3$) with or without vacancies, as well as inorganic perovskites CsPbI$_3$ and CsPbBr$_3$, in various phases. We show also the relationship between the size of the voids, through Voronoi volumes, and the calculated lifetimes. For the cubic phases we investigate in detail the role of polymorphism, including the distribution of vacancy formation energies and positron annihilation lifetimes. In our lifetimes calculations, apart from older and more recent semi-local approximations for the electron-positron correlation potential, we also consider the weighted density approximation (WDA), which is truly non-local and should better describe positron annihilation in regions with strong electronic density variations. We show that for this class of materials, and especially for cations vacancies, the influence of the chosen approximation is crucial, much stronger than in metals, alloys and conventional semiconductors. This influence may induce to reconsider the interpretation of experimentally determined lifetimes.

Title: Robust Universality of Non-Hermitian Anderson Transitions: From Dyson Singularity to Model-Independent Scaling
Authors: Ali Tozar
Abstract: We investigate the universality of Anderson localization transitions in one-dimensional non-Hermitian systems exhibiting the skin effect. By developing a numerically stable Log-Space Non-Hermitian Scaling (LNS) method, we overcome the severe floating-point overflow issues associated with the exponential growth of transmittance (T ~ exp(2 gamma L)), enabling precision finite-size scaling analysis up to system sizes of L = 1200. We probe the critical behavior across three distinct disorder landscapes: uniform diagonal, binary diagonal, and off-diagonal (random hopping) disorder. While the uniform model exhibits a standard mobility edge, the off-diagonal model reveals a Dyson-like singularity at the band center (E = 0), where the system resists localization even at strong disorder due to sublattice symmetry protection. However, upon symmetry breaking (E != 0), we demonstrate that all considered models, regardless of the disorder distribution (continuous vs. discrete) or Hamiltonian structure (site vs. bond randomness), belong to the same robust universality class. The critical exponents are determined as nu = 1.50 +/- 0.00 and beta ~ 0.65 through unambiguous data collapse, establishing a model-independent description of non-Hermitian localization transitions.

Title: Inductive van der Waals Force between Two Quantum Loops
Authors: Kicheon Kang
Abstract: We study the van der Waals-London force, which is typically associated with fluctuating dipoles in atoms, in a mesoscopic circuit consisting of two inductively coupled superconducting loops. We investigate the ``inductive" van der Waals-London interaction using both semiclassical and quantum electrodynamic (QED) approaches. The semiclassical model predicts a repulsive interaction due to anticorrelated current fluctuations. In contrast, the QED framework, which incorporates virtual photon exchange, reveals a predominantly attractive force. A key contribution comes from a state-independent two-photon exchange, which is absent in the semiclassical description and undetectable by spectroscopy. Our study introduces a new experimental platform for measuring the van der Waals force between individual artificial atoms via controlled mesoscopic circuits.

Title: Hamiltonian Active Matter in Incompressible Fluid Membranes
Authors: Sneha Krishnan, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: Active proteins and membrane-bound motors exert force dipole flows along fluid interfaces and lipid bilayers. We develop a unified hydrodynamic and Hamiltonian framework for the interactions of pusher and puller dipoles embedded in an incompressible two-dimensional membrane supported by a shallow viscous subphase. Beginning from the screened Stokes equations of the membrane--subphase composite, we derive the real-space incompressible Green's tensor, obtain its near- and far-field asymptotics, and construct the resulting dipolar velocity and stream functions. Although generic dipoles reorient under the local membrane vorticity, we show that the far-field dipolar flow is vorticity-free; force-free motors therefore retain fixed orientation and obey a Hamiltonian dynamics in which the positions of $N$ dipoles evolve via an effective Hamiltonian built from the dipolar stream function. In the near field, where the flow possesses finite vorticity, a Hamiltonian formulation is recovered in the quenched-orientation limit. Exploiting this structure, we simulate ensembles of pusher and puller dipoles and compare the dynamics generated by the $1/r$ near-field kernel and the subphase screened $1/r^{3}$ far-field kernel. For identical dipoles, the far-field Hamiltonian produces rapid clustering from random initial conditions, whereas the near-field Hamiltonian suppresses collapse and yields extended, non-aggregating configurations.

Title: Tuning the Electronic States of Bi2Se3 Films with Large Spin-Orbit Interaction Using Molecular Heterojunctions
Authors: Matthew Rogers, Craig Knox, Bryan Hickey, Lida Ansari, Farzan Gity, Timothy Moorsom, Mairi McCauley, Gilberto Teobaldi, Manuel dos Santos Dias, Hari B. Vasili, Manuel Valvidares, Mannan Ali, Gavin Burnell, Ahmet Yagmur, Satoshi Sasaki, Oscar Cespedes
Abstract: An electric bias can shift the Fermi level along the Dirac cone of a topological insulator and modify its charge transport, but tuning the electronic states and spin-orbit interaction (SOI) without destroying the surface topology is challenging. Here, we show that thin film Bi2Se3/n-p (p-n) molecular diodes form ordered interfaces where charge transfer and orbital re-hybridisation result in a decrease (increase) of the carrier density and improved mobility. In Bi2Se3 the spin-orbit lifetime, t_so, is 0.13 ps, which is comparable to the strongest spin-orbit materials. This lifetime drops further to 0.06 ps (0.09 ps) with the addition of p-n (n-p) molecular diodes, at the limit of measurable values. This strengthened spin-orbit interaction occurs even though molecules are made of light elements and increase the mean free path of the charge carriers by almost 50%, indicating changes to the Berry curvature and/or Rashba splitting around the hybridisation points. Raman spectroscopy gives evidence that the coupling effect may be controlled by optical irradiation, opening a pathway towards the design of heavy-light element hybrids with optically tunable quantum transport.

Title: A Landau Theory for Pair Density Modulation in Fe(Te,Se) flakes
Authors: Po-Jui Chen, Piers Coleman
Abstract: Motivated by recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) experiments reporting a pair-density modulation (PDM) in FeTe$_{0.55}$Se$_{0.45}$, we develop a Landau theory to elucidate the physical origin of this phenomenon. We analyze the PDM in terms of the screw symmetry of the single layer, interpreting it as a hybridized state of two order parameters of opposite glide and screw parity. Discussing the absence of PDM in the bulk where both glide and screw symmetry are present, we argue that the absence of glide symmetry on the surface allows nematic order to selectively stabilize the PDM in thin flakes. Finally, we discuss the symmetry constraints on the microscopic pairing mechanism, pointing out the opposite glide and screw parities of the order parameters favor a site, rather than a bond-based paring mechanism. This suggests that pairing in iron-based superconductors may be local to the iron atoms, possibly driven by Hunds coupling.

Title: Real-Time Dynamics in Two Dimensions with Tensor Network States via Time-Dependent Variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Yantao Wu
Abstract: Reliably simulating two-dimensional many-body quantum dynamics with projected entangled pair states (PEPS) has long been a difficult challenge. In this work, we overcome this barrier for low-energy quantum dynamics by developing a stable and efficient time-dependent variational Monte Carlo (tVMC) framework for PEPS. By analytically removing all gauge redundancies of the PEPS manifold and exploiting tensor locality, we obtain a numerically well-conditioned stochastic reconfiguration (SR) equation amenable to robust solution using the efficient Cholesky decomposition, enabling long-time evolution in previously inaccessible regimes. We demonstrate the power and generality of the method through four representative real-time problems in two dimensions: (I) chiral edge propagation in a free-fermion Chern insulator; (II) fractionalized charge transport in a fractional Chern insulator; (III) vison confinement dynamics in the Higgs phase of a Z2 lattice gauge theory; and (IV) superfluidity and critical velocity in interacting bosons. All simulations are performed on 12x12 or 13x13 lattices with evolution times T = 10 to 12 using modest computational resources (1 to 5 days on a single GPU card). Where exact benchmarks exist (case I), PEPS-tVMC matches free-fermion dynamics with high accuracy up to T = 12. These results establish PEPS-tVMC as a practical and versatile tool for real-time quantum dynamics in two dimensions. The method extends the reach of classical tensor-network simulations for studying elementary excitations in quantum many-body systems and provides a valuable computational counterpart to emerging quantum simulators.

Title: Dynamic Screening Effects on Auger Recombination in Metal-Halide Perovskites
Authors: Utkarsh Singh, Sergei I. Simak
Abstract: The performance of modern light-emitting technologies, from lasers to LEDs, is limited by nonradiative losses, with Auger recombination being the dominant channel at device-relevant carrier densities. Reliable modeling of this process is essential, yet conventional treatments neglect dynamic dielectric effects, limiting the predictive reliability at operating conditions. We develop a general framework that incorporates the frequency-dependent screened Coulomb interaction $W_{00}(\mathbf{q},\omega)$, computed from low-scaling \textit{GW}, into both direct and phonon-assisted Auger amplitudes. Demonstrated on orthorhombic $\gamma$-CsPbI$_3$ (band gap $E_g\approx1.73$ eV) and $\gamma$-CsSnI$_3$ ($E_g\approx1.30$ eV), the approach shows that dynamic screening enhances the dielectric response, lowering the room-temperature Auger coefficient by $\sim$50-60 %. This renormalization shifts the crossover between radiative and nonradiative recombination by nearly a factor of two in carrier density. Dynamic dielectric screening thus emerges as a quantitative determinant of Auger recombination, offering a transferable framework for predictive modeling across polar semiconductors where frequency-independent screening models are inadequate.

Title: Higher-dimensional Euclidean and non-Euclidean structures in planar circuit quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Alberto Saa, Eduardo Miranda, Francisco Rouxinol
Abstract: We show that a recent proposal for simulating planar hyperbolic lattices with circuit quantum electrodynamics can be extended to accommodate also higher dimensional lattices in Euclidean and non-Euclidean spaces if one allows for circuits with more than three polygons at each vertex. The quantum dynamics of these circuits, which can be constructed with present-day technology, are governed by effective tight-binding Hamiltonians corresponding to higher-dimensional Kagomé-like structures ($n$-dimensional zeolites), which are well known to exhibit strong frustration and flat bands. We analyze the relevant spectra of these systems and derive an exact expression for the fraction of flat-band states. Our results expand considerably the range of non-Euclidean geometry realizations with circuit quantum electrodynamics.

Title: Open interacting particle systems and Ising measures
Authors: Ngo P.N. Ngoc, Gunter M. Schütz
Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn (KLS) is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the conventional open asymmetric simple exclusion process, which exhibits only one extremal-current phase or the previously considered conventional open KLS model with one or three extremal-current phases.

Title: Hierarchic superradiant phases in anisotropic Dicke model
Authors: D. K. He, Z. Song
Abstract: We revisit the phase diagram of an anisotropic Dicke model by revealing the non-analyticity induced by underlying exceptional points. We find that, from a dynamical perspective, the conventional superradiant phase can be further separated into three regions, in which the systems are characterized by different effective Hamiltonians, including the harmonic oscillator, the inverted harmonic oscillator, and their respective counterparts. We employ the Loschmidt echo to characterize different quantum phases by analyzing the quench dynamics of a trivial initial state. Numerical simulations for finite systems confirm our predictions about the existence of hierarchic superradiant phases.

Title: Photon condensation from thermal sources and the limits of heat engines
Authors: Luisa Toledo Tude, Emily Haughton, Paul R. Eastham
Abstract: The trapping and cooling of photon gases in microcavities has been used to create Bose-Einstein condensates. We investigate the conditions required for condensation in dye-filled microcavities, with photon populations created either by driving a transition of the dye, or by coupling the cavity modes to a thermal photon reservoir such as sunlight. We find that the threshold pump temperature, above which condensation appears, is determined by the second law of thermodynamics. The minimum achievable threshold is that of a reversible three-level heat engine, which we show arises in the dye-pumped case, and for pumping of the modes of a two-level cavity. For a many-level cavity condensation occurs at a similar but higher temperature. Our results show that photon condensates can be produced by pumping with incoherent thermal sources, opening possibilities for coherent light generation, energy harvesting, and experimental studies of quantum heat engines.

Title: Nitrogen-Vacancy Emission from Nanodiamond: Size, Depth, and Surroundings
Authors: Harini Hapuarachchi, Francesco Campaioli, Jared H Cole, Andrew D Greentree, Qiang Sun
Abstract: The negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is a leading solid-state quantum emitter, offering spin-photon interfaces over a wide temperature range with applications from electromagnetic sensing to bioimaging. While NV centers in bulk diamond are well understood, embedding them in nanodiamond (ND) introduces complexities from size, NV location, and NV polarizations. NVs in ND show altered fluorescence properties including longer lifetimes, lower quantum efficiency, and higher sensitivity to dielectric surroundings, which arise from radiative suppression, surface-induced non-radiative decay, and escape inefficiency at the diamond-background interface. Prior models typically addressed isolated aspects, such as dielectric contrast or surface quenching, without integrating full quantum-optical NV behavior with classical electrodynamics. We present a hybrid framework coupling rigorous electromagnetic simulations with a quantum-optical NV model including phonon sideband dynamics. NV emission is found to depend strongly on ND size, NV position, and surrounding refractive index. Our results explain observations such as shallow NVs in water-coated ND appearing brighter than deeper ones in air. This integrated model provides a unified framework for realistic NV in ND emission scenarios and informs the design of efficient NV-based sensors and quantum devices, advancing understanding of quantum emitter photophysics in nanoscale crystals.

Title: Stoquasticity is not enough: towards a sharper diagnostic for Quantum Monte Carlo simulability
Authors: Arman Babakhani, Armen Karakashian
Abstract: Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methods are powerful tools for simulating quantum many-body systems, yet their applicability is limited by the infamous sign problem. We approach this challenge through the lens of Vanishing Geometric Phases (VGP) \cite{Hen_2021}, introducing it as a `geometric' criterion for diagnosing QMC simulability. We characterize the class of VGP Hamiltonians, and analyze the complexity of recognizing this class, identifying both hard and efficiently identifiable cases. We further highlight the practical advantage of the VGP criterion by exhibiting specific Hamiltonians that are readily identified as sign-problem-free through VGP, yet whose stoquasticity is difficult to ascertain. These examples underscore the efficiency and sharpness of VGP as a diagnostic tool compared to stoquasticity-based heuristics. Beyond classification, we propose a family of VGP-inspired diagnostics that serve as quantitative indicators of sign problem severity. While exact evaluation of these quantities is generically intractable, we demonstrate their mathematical power in performing scaling analysis for the average sign under unitary transformations. Our results provide both a conceptual foundation and practical tools for understanding and mitigating the sign problem.

Title: Asymptotic limits of the axisymmetric solution of the Brinkman equation for a point force near a no-slip wall
Authors: Abdallah Daddi-Moussa-Ider, Andrej Vilfan
Abstract: We derive the far-field and near-field solutions for the Green's function of a point force acting perpendicular to a no-slip wall in a Brinkman fluid, focusing on the regime where the distance between the force and the wall is much smaller than the screening length. The general solution is obtained in closed form up to a single integral and can be systematically expanded in a Taylor series in both the far-field and near-field limits. The flow can then be expressed as a series of source-multipole singularities with an additional, analytically known, correction in the proximity of the wall. Comparisons with numerical integration demonstrate the accuracy and reliability of the asymptotic expansions. The results are also applicable to the unsteady Stokes flow driven by a localized assembly of forces, such as a beating cilium protruding from a flat surface.

Title: Data-Driven Learnability Transition of Measurement-Induced Entanglement
Authors: Dongheng Qian, Jing Wang
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement (MIE) captures how local measurements generate long-range quantum correlations and drive dynamical phase transitions in many-body systems. Yet estimating MIE experimentally remains challenging: direct evaluation requires extensive post-selection over measurement outcomes, raising the question of whether MIE is accessible with only polynomial resources. We address this challenge by reframing MIE detection as a data-driven learning problem that assumes no prior knowledge of state preparation. Using measurement records alone, we train a neural network in a self-supervised manner to predict the uncertainty metric for MIE--the gap between upper and lower bounds of the average post-measurement bipartite entanglement. Applied to random circuits with one-dimensional all-to-all connectivity and two-dimensional nearest-neighbor coupling, our method reveals a learnability transition with increasing circuit depth: below a threshold, the uncertainty is small and decreases with polynomial measurement data and model parameters, while above it the uncertainty remains large despite increasing resources. We further verify this transition experimentally on current noisy quantum devices, demonstrating its robustness to realistic noise. These results highlight the power of data-driven approaches for learning MIE and delineate the practical limits of its classical learnability.

Title: F2: Offline Reinforcement Learning for Hamiltonian Simulation via Free-Fermionic Subroutine Compilation
Authors: Ethan Decker, Christopher Watson, Junyu Zhou, Yuhao Liu, Chenxu Liu, Ang Li, Gushu Li, Samuel Stein
Abstract: Compiling shallow and accurate quantum circuits for Hamiltonian simulation remains challenging due to hardware constraints and the combinatorial complexity of minimizing gate count and circuit depth. Existing optimization method pipelines rely on hand-engineered classical heuristics, which cannot learn input-dependent structure and therefore miss substantial opportunities for circuit reduction. We introduce F2, an offline reinforcement learning framework that exploits free-fermionic structure to efficiently compile Trotter-based Hamiltonian simulation circuits. F2 provides (i) a reinforcement-learning environment over classically simulatable free-fermionic subroutines, (ii) architectural and objective-level inductive biases that stabilize long-horizon value learning, and (iii) a reversible synthetic-trajectory generation mechanism that consistently yields abundant, guaranteed-successful offline data. Across benchmarks spanning lattice models, protein fragments, and crystalline materials (12-222 qubits), F2 reduces gate count by 47% and depth by 38% on average relative to strong baselines (Qiskit, Cirq/OpenFermion) while maintaining average errors of 10^(-7). These results show that aligning deep reinforcement learning with the algebraic structure of quantum dynamics enables substantial improvements in circuit synthesis, suggesting a promising direction for scalable, learning-based quantum compilation
