Title: Global Ashkin-Teller Phase Diagrams in Two and Three Dimensions: Multicritical Bifurcation versus Double Tricriticality Endpoint
Authors: Ibrahim Kecoglu, A. Nihat Berker
Abstract: The global phase diagrams of the Askin-Teller model are calculated in d=2 and 3 by renormalization-group theory that is exact on the hierarchical lattice and approximate on the recently improved Migdal-Kadanoff procedure. Three different ordered phases occur in the dimensionally distinct phase diagrams that reflect three-fold order-parameter permutation symmetry, a closed symmetry line, and a quasi-disorder line. First- and second-order phase boundaries are obtained. In d=2, second-order phase transitions meeting at a bifurcation point are seen. In d=3, first- and second-order phase transitions are separated by tricritical and critical endpoints.

Title: Quantum Critical Dynamics Induced by Topological Zero Modes
Authors: Ilia Komissarov, Tobias Holder, Raquel Queiroz
Abstract: We investigate the low-frequency ac transport in the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain with chiral disorder near the topological delocalization transition. Our key finding is that the formation of hybridized pairs of topological domain wall zero modes leads to the anomalous logarithmic scaling of the ac conductivity $\sigma(\omega) \sim \log \omega$ at criticality, and $\sigma(\omega) \sim \omega^{2 \delta} \log ^2 \omega$ away from it. Using the combination of real-space renormalization group analysis and qualitative hybridization arguments, we demonstrate that the form of the scaling of ac conductivity at criticality stems directly from the stretched-exponential ($\psi(x) \sim e^{-s \sqrt{x}}$) spatial decay of zero-mode wavefunctions at the critical point.

Title: Canted magnetism and $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization in metallic states of the Lieb lattice Hubbard model near quarter filling
Authors: Alexander Nikolaenko, Pietro M. Bonetti, Anant Kale, Martin Lebrat, Markus Greiner, Subir Sachdev
Abstract: A recent experiment has examined ultracold, fermionic, spin-1/2 $^6$Li atoms in the Lieb lattice at different Hubbard repulsion $U$ and filling fractions $\nu$ (Lebrat et al. arXiv:2404.17555). At $\nu=1/2$ and small $U$, they observe an enhanced compressibility on the $p_{x,y}$ sites, pointing to a flat band near the Fermi energy. At $\nu=1/2$ and large $U$ they observe an insulating ferrimagnet. Both small and large $U$ observations at $\nu=1/2$ are consistent with theoretical expectations. Surprisingly, near $\nu=1/4$ and large $U$, they again observe a large $p_{x,y}$ compressibility, pointing to a flat $p_{x,y}$ band of fermions across the Fermi energy. Our Hartree-Fock computations near $\nu=1/4$ find states with canted magnetism (and related spiral states) at large $U$, which possess nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ bands near the Fermi level. We employ parton theories to describe quantum fluctuations of the magnetic order found in Hartree-Fock. We find a metallic state with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalization possessing gapless, fermionic, spinless `chargons' carrying $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge charges which have a nearly flat $p_{x,y}$ band near their Fermi level: this fractionalized metal is also consistent with observations. Our DMRG study does not indicate the presence of magnetic order, and so supports a fractionalized ground state. Given the conventional ferrimagnetic insulator at $\nu=1/2$, the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ fractionalized metal at $\nu=1/4$ represents a remarkable realization of doping-induced fractionalization.

Title: Non-Abelian phases from the condensation of Abelian anyons
Authors: Misha Yutushui, Maria Hermanns, David F. Mross
Abstract: The observed fractional quantum Hall (FQH) plateaus follow a recurring hierarchical structure that allows an understanding of complex states based on simpler ones. Condensing the elementary quasiparticles of an Abelian FQH state results in a new Abelian phase at a different filling factor, and this process can be iterated \textit{ad infinitum}. We show that condensing clusters of the same quasiparticles into an Abelian state can instead realize non-Abelian FQH states. In particular, condensing quasiparticle pairs in the $\nu=\frac{2}{3}$ Laughlin state yields the anti-Pfaffian phase at half-filling. We moreover show that the successive condensation of Laughlin quasiparticles produces quantum Hall states whose fillings coincide with the most prominent plateaus in the first excited Landau level of GaAs. More generally, such condensation can realize any non-Abelian FQH state that admits a parton representation. This surprising result is supported by an exact analysis of explicit wavefunctions, field theory arguments, conformal-field theory constructions of trial states, and numerical simulations.

Title: Quantum geometric photocurrents of quasiparticles in superconductors
Authors: Daniel Kaplan, Kevin P. Lucht, Pavel A. Volkov, J.H. Pixley
Abstract: Nonlinear optical response is a sensitive probe of the geometry and symmetry of electronic Bloch states in solids. Here, we extend this notion to the Bogoliubiov-de-Gennes (BdG) quasiparticles in superconductors. We present a theory of photocurrents in superconductors and show that they sensitively depend on the quantum geometry of the BdG excitation spectrum. For all light polarizations, the photocurrent is proportional to the quantum geometric tensor: for linear polarized light it is related to the quantum metric and for circular polarization -- the Berry curvature dipole of the associated BdG bands. We further relate the photocurrent to the ground state symmetries, providing a symmetry dictionary for the allowed photocurrent responses. For light not at normal incidence to the sample, photocurrent probes time-reversal symmetry breaking in systems with chiral point groups (such as twisted bilayers). We demonstrate that photocurrents allow to probe topology and TRS breaking in twisted $d$-wave superconductors and test the nature of superconductivity in twisted WSe$_2$ and multilayer stacks of rhombohedral graphene. Our results pave the way to contactless measurement of the quantum geometric properties and symmetry of superconductivity in materials and heterostructures.

Title: Transformations induced by hydrostatic pressure on lead metasilicate phases
Authors: Ariano D. Rodrigues, Thiago R. Cunha, Rafaella B. Pena, Ulisses F. Kaneko, Lucas M. E. Pinho, Benjamim J. A. Moulton, Paulo S. Pizani
Abstract: For most silicates, controlling the crystallization - through the nucleation, growth, and stabilization of distinct crystalline phase - is critical to achieving the desired physical properties in the final glass-ceramic product. In this context, lead metasilicate PbSiO3 (PS) represents an ideal model system for investigating structural evolution under varying pressure and temperature conditions. This is primarily due to its distinct Raman signatures and the capability of resolving its structure with high precision through diffraction measurements. These attributes enable a comprehensive evaluation of the thermodynamic quantities involved in this complex process, which are essential for the physical description of the crystallization of glasses undergoing heterogeneous nucleation. We report on high-pressure in situ analyses of three crystalline phases of PS: a stable monoclinic structure, a metastable hexagonal structure, and a lower symmetry metastable phase. Combined high-pressure Raman and synchrotron X-ray diffraction indicate that the structures are highly sensitive to the application of hydrostatic pressure and that significant structural rearrangements can be achieved in moderate pressure regimes. Such analyses also enabled determining important thermodynamic variables of those systems, such as compressibility. From an applied perspective, our findings demonstrate that the application of pressure achievable using large-volume presses and capable of altering the energy states of such phases, can be regarded as a promising strategy to influence the stages of the overall crystallization process. This approach opens new avenues for the development of novel structures and properties in the resulting glass-ceramic materials

Title: Vibrational properties of photochromic yttrium oxyhydride and oxydeuteride thin films
Authors: Martins Zubkins, Jevgenijs Gabrusenoks, Rihards Aleksis, George Chikvaidze, Edvards Strods, Viktors Vibornijs, Alons Lends, Karlis Kundzins, Juris Purans
Abstract: A comprehensive study of the vibrational properties of photochromic yttrium oxyhydride (YHO) and oxydeuteride (YDO) thin films is presented. These films are deposited using reactive magnetron sputtering, followed by post-oxidation. Our investigation employs vibrational Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, in conjunction with first-principles Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. The FTIR spectra of the films reveal broad vibrational bands, primarily attributed to the disordered structure containing small crystallites (<10 nm), as confirmed by solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance and X-ray diffraction measurements. An isotopic shift from approximately 900 to 745 cm-1 is observed in the hydrogen/deuterium-related vibration band, while the lower frequency bands (< 600 cm-1) remain unaffected upon replacement of hydrogen with deuterium. These experimental observations are consistent with the DFT theoretical calculations for various stable YHO lattices reported in the literature. Illumination of the films with ultraviolet light at 3.3 eV leads to additional absorption not only in the visible light range but also up to approximately 2000 cm-1 in the mid-infrared region. However, no phase transformation change or formation of hydroxyl (OH) groups are observed following illumination. Our findings provide valuable insight into the vibrational and photochromic properties of YH(D)O thin films.

Title: Implicit Geometric Descriptor-Enabled ANN Framework for a Unified Structure-Property Relationship in Architected Nanofibrous Materials
Authors: Bhanugoban Maheswaran, Komal Chawla, Abhishek Gupta, Ramathasan Thevamaran
Abstract: Hierarchically architected nanofibrous materials, such as the vertically aligned carbon nanotube (VACNT) foams, draw their exceptional mechanical properties from the interplay of nanoscale size effects and inter-nanotube interactions within and across architectures. However, the distinct effects of these mechanisms, amplified by the architecture, on different mechanical properties remain elusive, limiting their independent tunability for targeted property combinations. Reliance on architecture-specific explicit design parameters further inhibits the development of a unified structure-property relationship rooted in those nanoscale mechanisms. Here, we introduce two implicit geometric descriptors -- multi-component shape invariants (MCSI) -- in an artificial neural network (ANN) framework to establish a unified structure-property relationship that governs diverse architectures. The MCSIs effectively capture the key nanoscale mechanisms that give rise to the bulk mechanical properties such as specific-energy absorption, peak stress, and average modulus. Exploiting their ability to predict mechanical properties for designs that are even outside of the training data, we propose generalized design strategies to achieve desired mechanical property combinations in architected VACNT foams. Such implicit descriptor-enabled ANN frameworks can guide the accelerated and tractable design of complex hierarchical materials for applications ranging from shock-absorbing layers in extreme environments to functional components in soft robotics.

Title: Nature of the ferromagnet-paramagnet transition in Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_{x}$TiO$_{3}$
Authors: S. Hameed, I. Khayr, J. Joe, G. Q. Zhao, Y. Cai, K. M. Kojima, S. Chi, T. J. Williams, M. Matsuda, Y. J. Uemura, M. Greven
Abstract: Neutron scattering, magnetometry, and muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) measurements were performed to investigate the magnetic order and spin dynamics across the ferromagnet-to-paramagnet transition in the hole-doped Mott insulator Y$_{1-x}$Ca$_x$TiO$_3$. We find that the transition proceeds through a volume-wise phase separation into ferromagnetic and paramagnetic regions. Spin fluctuations with a characteristic timescale of $\sim$ 0.1 $\mu$s, as detected via $\mu$SR, are observed to appear at Ca concentrations $x \geq 0.10$. The magnetic phase separation, accompanied by a modest dynamic response, represents a novel behavior in Mott systems near the loss of magnetic order. It is linked to a previously observed insulator-metal transition and the associated electronic phase separation into hole-poor Mott insulating and hole-rich metallic phases for $0 < x < 0.50$. In particular, the $x$-dependence of the paramagnetic volume fraction strongly correlates with that of the volume fraction of the hole-rich metallic phase. The spin-wave spectra reveal a doping-induced crossover from isotropic to two-dimensional anisotropic exchange interactions, reflecting substantial changes in the orbital state with increasing Ca content.

Title: Robust Super-Moiré in Large Angle Single-Twist Bilayers
Authors: Yanxing Li, Chuqiao Shi, Fan Zhang, Xiaohui Liu, Yuan Xue, Viet-Anh Ha, Qiang Gao, Chengye Dong, Yu-chuan Lin, Luke N Holtsman, Nicolas Morales-Durán, Hyunsue Kim, Yi Jiang, Madisen Holbrook, James Hone, Katayun Barmak, Joshua Robinson, Xiaoqin Li, Feliciano Giustino, Eslam Khalaf, Yimo Han, Chih-Kang Shih
Abstract: Forming long wavelength moiré superlattices (MSL) at small-angle twist van der Waals (vdW) bilayers has been a key approach to creating moiré flat bands. The small-angle twist, however, leads to strong lattice reconstruction, causing domain walls and moiré disorders, which pose considerable challenges in engineering such platforms. At large twist angles, the rigid lattices render a more robust, but shorter wavelength MSL, making it difficult to engineer flat bands. Here, we depict a novel approach to tailoring robust super-moiré (SM) structures that combines the advantages of both small-twist and large-twist transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) bilayers using only a single twist angle near a commensurate angle. Structurally, we unveil the spontaneous formation of a periodic arrangement of three inequivalent commensurate moiré (CM) stacking, where the angle deviation from the commensurate angle can tune the periodicity. Electronically, we reveal a large set of van Hove singularities (VHSs) that indicate strong band hybridization, leading to flat bands near the valence band maximum. Our study paves the way for a new platform of robust SM bilayers with structural rigidity and controllable wavelength, extending the investigation of the interplay among band topology, quantum geometry, and moiré superconductivity to the large twist angle regime.

Title: Strong coupling of polaritons at room temperature in a GaAs/AlGaAs structure
Authors: Hassan Alnatah, Shuang Liang, Qiaochu Wan, Jonathan Beaumariage, Ken West, Kirk Baldwin, Loren N. Pfeiffer, Man Chun Alan Tam, Zbigniew R. Wasilewski, David W. Snoke
Abstract: We report direct measurement of the dispersion relation of polaritons in GaAs/AlGaAs microcavity structures at room temperature, which clearly shows that the polaritons are in the strong coupling limit. The Rabi splitting of the polariton states decreases as the polariton gas increases in density, but even when the polariton gas becomes a coherent, Bose-condensate-like state, the polaritons retain a strong exciton component, as seen in the nonlinear energy shift of the light emission. This opens up the possibility of polaritonic devices at room temperature in a material system which can be grown with very high quality and uniformity.

Title: Orbitronics in Two-dimensional Materials
Authors: Tarik P. Cysne, Luis M. Canonico, Marcio Costa, R. B. Muniz, Tatiana G. Rappoport
Abstract: Orbitronics explores the control and manipulation of electronic orbital angular momentum in solid-state systems, opening new pathways for information processing and storage. One significant advantage of orbitronics over spintronics is that it does not rely on spin-orbit coupling, thereby broadening the range of non-magnetic materials that can be utilized for these applications. It also introduces new topological features related to electronic orbital angular momentum, and clarifies some long-standing challenges in understanding experiments that rely on the conventional concept of valley transport. This review highlights recent advances in orbitronics, particularly in relation to two-dimensional materials. We examine the fundamental principles underlying the generation, transport, and dynamics of orbital angular momentum to illustrate how the unique properties of two-dimensional materials can promote orbitronic phenomena. We also outline potential future research directions and address some outstanding questions in this field.

Title: Edge non-collinear magnetism in nanoribbons of Fe3GeTe2 and Fe3GaTe2
Authors: R. Cardias, Anders Bergman, Hugo U. R. Strand, R. B. Muniz, Marcio Costa
Abstract: Fe3GeTe2 and Fe3GaTe2 are ferromagnetic conducting materials of van der Waals-type with unique magnetic properties that are highly promising for the development of new spintronic, orbitronic and magnonic devices. Even in the form of two-dimensional-like ultrathin films, they exhibit relatively high Curie temperature, magnetic anisotropy perpendicular to the atomic planes and multiple types of Hall effects. We explore nanoribbons made from single layers of these materials and show that they display non-collinear magnetic ordering at their edges. This magnetic inhomogeneity allows angular momentum currents to generate magnetic torques at the sample edges, regardless of their polarization direction, significantly enhancing the effectiveness of magnetization manipulation in these systems. We also demonstrate that it is possible to rapidly reverse the magnetization direction of these nanostructures by means of spin-orbit and spin-transfer torques with rather low current densities, making them quite propitious for non-volatile magnetic memory units.

Title: Bell correlations between momentum-entangled pairs of $^4\text{He}^*$ atoms
Authors: Y. S. Athreya, S. Kannan, X. T. Yan, R. J. Lewis-Swan, K. V. Kheruntsyan, A. G. Truscott, S. S. Hodgman
Abstract: Nonlocal entanglement between pair-correlated particles is a highly counter-intuitive aspect of quantum mechanics, where measurement on one particle can instantly affect the other, regardless of distance. While the rigorous Bell's inequality framework has enabled the demonstration of such entanglement in photons and atomic internal states, no experiment has yet involved motional states of massive particles. Here we report the experimental observation of Bell correlations in motional states of momentum-entangled ultracold helium atoms. Momentum-entangled pairs are generated via $s$-wave collisions. Using a Rarity-Tapster interferometer and a Bell-test framework, we observe atom-atom correlations required for violation of a Bell inequality. This result shows the potential of ultracold atoms for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics and opens new avenues to studying gravitational effects in quantum states.

Title: Geometric dependence of critical current magnitude and nonreciprocity in planar Josephson junctions
Authors: William F. Schiela, Melissa Mikalsen, William M. Strickland, Javad Shabani
Abstract: Planar Josephson junctions in a magnetic field exhibit the superconducting diode effect, by which the critical current magnitude depends on the polarity of the transport current. A number of different mechanisms for the effect have been this http URL, we study symmetric, T-shaped planar Josephson junctions with semiconducting weak links in an in-plane magnetic field perpendicular to an applied current bias. In particular, we vary the longitudinal width (i.e.\ parallel to the current) of the superconducting contacts and the voltage of an electrostatic gate. We observe an increase in both critical current and diode efficiency with increasing contact width and relate the critical current behavior to the induced coherence length of the Andreev bound states that mediate the supercurrent flow through the junction. We further observe a linear trend, with respect to inverse contact width, of the field at which the diode efficiency is maximized, which saturates as the contact width becomes large compared to the coherence length. The smaller field at which the critical current is maximized additionally exhibits a strong gate dependence. We interpret these observations in the context of multiple underlying mechanisms, including spin--orbit coupling and orbital effects.

Title: Analytical Diagonalization of Fermi Gas-like Hamiltonians using the Sommerfeld-Watson Transformation
Authors: G. Diniz, F. D. Picoli, M. P. Lenzarini
Abstract: The Sommerfeld-Watson transformation is a powerful mathematical technique widely used in physics to simplify summations over discrete quantum numbers by converting them into contour integrals in the complex plane. This method has applications in scattering theory, high-energy physics, quantum field theory, and electrostatics. A lesser-known but significant use is in the analytical diagonalization of specific Hamiltonians in condensed matter physics, such as the Fermi gas Hamiltonian and the single-impurity Anderson model with vanishing Coulomb repulsion. These models are used to describe important phenomena like conductance in metals, x-ray photoemission, and aspects of the Kondo problem. In this work, we provide a comprehensive explanation of the Sommerfeld-Watson transformation and its application in diagonalization procedures for these models, using modern notation to enhance clarity for new students. The analytical results were validated against the numerical diagonalization, showing excellent agreement. Furthermore, we extend the presented method to a more generalized non-interacting single-impurity Anderson model with variable couplings and arbitrary band dispersion. The procedure presented here successfully achieved the analytical diagonalization of this more complex model, providing a unified solution that encompasses simpler cases. To our knowledge, this general solution has not been previously reported.

Title: Abnormal Normal State and Pressure-driven Reentrant Superconductivity in the Heavy $d$-electron Superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$
Authors: Xiaofeng Xu, J. Y. Nie, C. Q. Xu, Z. M. Zhu, Xiangzhuo Xing, Y. L. Huang, C. T. Zhang, N. Zuo, C. C. Zhao, Z. Y. Zhang, W. Zhou, W. H. Jiao, S. Xu, Q. Zhang, Zhu-An Xu, X. B. Liu, Dong Qian, Shiyan Li
Abstract: Superconductivity beyond the conventional Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) framework often emerges out of a normal state that is accompanied by exotic magnetism and thereby displays many exceptional transport and thermodynamic properties. Here we report that the normal state of the heavy $d$-electron superconductor Rh$_{17}$S$_{15}$ is characterized by a weak \textit{ferromagnetism} that persists up to room temperature. We show that the broad hump in its resistivity likely results from the Kondo interaction of the conduction electrons with this novel magnetism. By applying pressure, superconductivity is fully suppressed first. In the high-pressure regime, however, we observe a second dome of superconductivity with its maximum $T_c$ greater than the ambient pressure value, highlighting the possible \textit{unconventional} superconductivity in this heavy $d$-electron sulfide.

Title: Non-ergodic Phase Transition in the Global Hysteresis of the Frustrated Magnet DyRu2Si2
Authors: S. Yoshimoto, Y. Tabata, T. Waki, H. Nakamura
Abstract: Some frustrated magnets exhibit a huge hysteresis called "global hysteresis (GH)", where the magnetic plateaus appearing in the increasing field process are skipped in the decreasing field process from the high magnetic field state. In this paper, we focused on the frustrated magnet DyRu2Si2 and measured magnetization relaxations from two plateau states inside the GH loop, the phases III and IV, and investigated the phase transitions into them. As a result of the relaxation measurements, no relaxation is observed in the phase III, whereas long-time relaxations of more than 105 sec are observed at the phase IV plateau. Moreover, a Mpemba-effect-like relaxation phenomenon where the relaxation from an initial state prepared in the zero-field-cooled condition overtakes that from an initial state prepared in the field-cooled condition is observed. These results indicate that the phase IV is the non-ergodic state with a complex free-energy landscape with multiple local minima, while the phase III has a simple free energy structure. Therefore, the III-IV phase transition is considered to be the ergodic to non-ergodic phase transition. Although this type of phase transition typically occurs in random glassy systems, the phase IV in DyRu2Si2 has a regular long-range ordered magnetic structure and yet exhibits non-ergodic properties, which is highly nontrivial. Our findings open the possibility of observing non-ergodic states in frustrated magnets with regular long-range orders.

Title: Disordered ground state in the 3D face-centred frustrated spin-$\frac{5}{2}$ system MnSn(OH)$_\text{6}$
Authors: Kaushick K. Parui, Anton A. Kulbakov, Ellen Häußler, Nikolai S. Pavlovskii, Aswathi Mannathanath Chakkingal, Maxim Avdeev, Roman Gumeniuk, Sergey Granovsky, Alexander Mistonov, Sergei A. Zvyagin, Thomas Doert, Dmytro S. Inosov, Darren C. Peets
Abstract: Frustrated magnetism in face-centred cubic (fcc) magnetic sublattices remains underexplored but holds considerable potential for exotic magnetic behaviour. Here we report on the crystal structure, magnetic and thermodynamic properties of the $A$-site-vacant double hydroxide perovskite MnSn(OH)$_6$. Despite dominant antiferromagnetic interactions among Mn$^{2+}$ moments, evidenced by a negative Curie-Weiss temperature, the lack of a sharp thermodynamic transition down to 350$\,$mK implies the absence of long-range magnetic order. However, a broad hump in the specific heat at 1.6$\,$K suggests short-range correlations. Neutron diffraction at low temperatures confirms the presence of three-dimensional (3D) antiferromagnetic correlations, manifested as diffuse magnetic scattering with a correlation length $\xi = 24.66\,$Å and magnetic propagation vectors $\mathbf{k}=(\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2}\,\frac{1}{2})$ and $(0\,0.625\,0)$ at 20$\,$mK.

Title: Nonmonotonic concentration dependence of the self-diffusion coefficient of surfactants in wormlike micellar solutions
Authors: Yusuke Koide, Takato Ishida, Takashi Uneyama, Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: We investigate the concentration dependence of surfactant diffusion in wormlike micellar solutions using dissipative particle dynamics simulations. The simulations show that the self-diffusion coefficient of surfactants exhibits a nonmonotonic dependence on the surfactant concentration, as observed in previous experiments. We quantitatively reveal that this nonmonotonic behavior results from the competition between micellar center-of-mass diffusion and surfactant diffusion within micelles by decomposing the mean-square displacement of surfactants into the corresponding contributions. Furthermore, our detailed analyses demonstrate how the competition between the two diffusion mechanisms is governed by the aggregation number distribution, the dynamics of individual surfactants and micelles, and the kinetics of micellar scission and recombination.

Title: Fundamental Origin of Viscosity in 2D Simple Liquids
Authors: Dong Huang, Shaoyu Lu, Chen Liang, Matteo Baggioli, Yan Feng
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in liquid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its physical origin at the individual particle kinetic level remains strongly debated. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple liquids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in all the 2D liquids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D liquids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D liquids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.

Title: Ultrasound measurement technique for the single-turn-coil magnets
Authors: T. Nomura, A. Hauspurg, D. I. Gorbunov, A. Miyata, E. Schulze, S. A. Zvyagin, V. Tsurkan, Y. H. Matsuda, Y. Kohama, S. Zherlitsyn
Abstract: Ultrasound is a powerful means to study numerous phenomena of condensed-matter physics as acoustic waves couple strongly to structural, magnetic, orbital, and charge degrees of freedom. In this paper, we present such technique combined with single-turn coils (STC) which generate magnetic fields beyond 100 T with the typical pulse duration of 6 us. As a benchmark of this technique, the ultrasound results for MnCr2S4, Cu6[Si6O18]6H2O, and liquid oxygen are shown. The resolution for the relative sound-velocity change in the STC is estimated as Delta v/v~10^-3, which is sufficient to study various field-induced phase transitions and critical phenomena.

Title: Instability of a fluctuating biomimetic membrane driven by an applied uniform DC electric field
Authors: Zongxin Yu, Shuozhen Zhao, Michael J. Miksis, Petia M. Vlahovska
Abstract: The linear stability of a lipid membrane under a DC electric field, applied perpendicularly to the interface, is investigated in the electrokinetic framework, taking account to the dynamics of the Debye layers formed near the membrane. The perturbed charge in the Debye layer redistributes and destabilizes the membrane via electrical surface stress interior and exterior to the membrane. The instability is suppressed as the difference in the electrolyte concentration of the solutions separated by the membrane increases, due to a weakened base state electric field near the membrane. This result contrasts with the destabilizing effect predicted using the leaky dielectric model in cases of asymmetric conductivity. We attribute this difference to the varying assumptions about the perturbation amplitude relative to the Debye length, which result in different regimes of validity for the linear stability analysis within these two frameworks.

Title: Bacterial swimming and accumulation on endothelial cell surfaces
Authors: Xin-Xin Xu, Yangguang Tian, Yuhe Pu, Bingchen Che, Hao Luo, Yanan Liu, Yan-Jun Liu, Guangyin Jing
Abstract: Flagellar-driven locomotion plays a critical role in bacterial attachment and colonization of surfaces, contributing to the risks of contamination and infection. Tremendous attempts to uncover the underlying principles governing bacterial motility near surfaces have relied on idealized assumptions of surrounding inorganic boundaries. However, in the context of living systems, the role of cells from tissues and organs becomes increasingly critical, particularly in bacterial swimming and adhesion, yet it remains poorly understood. Here, we propose using biological surfaces composed of vascular endothelial cells to experimentally investigate bacterial motion and interaction behaviors. Our results reveal that bacterial trapping observed on inorganic surfaces is counteractively manifested with reduced radii of circular motion on cellular surfaces, while with two distinct modes of bacterial adhesion: tight adhesion and loose adhesion. Interestingly, the presence of living cells enhances bacterial surface enrichment, and imposed flow intensifies this accumulation via bias-swimming effect. These results surprisingly indicate that physical effects remain the dominant factor regulating bacterial motility and accumulation at the single-cell layer level in vitro, bridging the gap between simplified hydrodynamic mechanisms and complex biological surfaces, with relevance to biofilm formation and bacterial contamination.

Title: Study of amorphous alumina coatings for next-generation nuclear reactors: hightemperature in-situ and post-mortem Raman spectroscopy and X-ray diffraction
Authors: Magdalena Gaweda, Piotr Jelen, Agata Zaborowska, Ryszard Diduszko, Lukasz Kurpaska
Abstract: The present work focuses on the investigation of the thermal stability and structural integrity of amorphous alumina coatings intended for use as protective coatings on cladding tubes in Generation IV nuclear reactors, specifically in the Lead-cooled Fast Reactor (LFR) type. Hightemperature Raman spectroscopy and high-temperature X-ray diffraction analyses were carried out up to 1050 C on a 5 um coating deposited by the pulsed laser deposition (PLD) technique on a 316L steel substrate. The experiments involved the in-situ examination of structural changes in the material under increasing temperature, along with ex-situ Raman imaging of the surface and cross-section of the coating after thermal treatments of different lengths. As it was expected, the presence of alpha-alumina was detected with the addition of other polymorphs, gamma- and theta-Al2O3, found in the material after longer high-temperature exposure. The use of two structural analysis methods and two lasers excitation wavelengths with Raman spectroscopy allowed us to detect all the mentioned phases despite different mode activity. Alumina analysis was based on the emission spectra, while substrate oxidation products were identified through the structural bands. The experiments depicted a dependence of the phase composition of oxidation products and alumina's degree of crystallization on the length of the treatment. Nevertheless, the observed structural changes did not occur rapidly, and the coating's integrity remained intact. Moreover, oxidation signs occurred locally at temperatures exceeding the LFR reactor's working temperature, confirming the material's great potential as a protective coating in the operational conditions of LFR nuclear reactors.

Title: Reversibly Strain Engineering and Electric-Field Control of Crystal Symmetry in Multiferroic Oxides
Authors: Fei Sun, Chao Chen, Deyang Chen, Minghui Qin, Xubing Lu, Xingsen Gao, Christopher T Nelson, Jun-Ming Liu
Abstract: Multiferroic oxides, such as BiFeO3, have garnered significant attention due to their coupled ferroelectric, magnetic, and elastic properties, offering exciting opportunities for multifunctional device applications. Controlling phase transitions in these materials is critical for tuning their physical properties and achieving desired functionalities. While numerous studies have focused on ferroelectric-ferroelectric transitions at rhombohedral-tetragonal morphotropic phase boundaries, far less attention has been given to the ferroelectric-antiferroelectric phase boundaries. Such systems hold promise for discovering novel physical phenomena, such as reversible phase transitions, enhanced piezoelectricity, and magnetoelectric coupling. In this work, we report a reversible antiferroelectric-to-ferroelectric phase transition in La doped BiFeO3 thin films. By modulating the residual strain via film thickness, an antiferroelectric orthorhombic phase is stabilized within a ferroelectric rhombohedral phase matrix. Under an external electric field, the phase transitions reversibly between these two states. This discovery not only enriches the understanding of orthorhombic-rhombohedral morphotropic phase boundaries but also provides a potential pathway for developing magnetoelectric devices with enhanced functionality.

Title: Roles of Defects and Sb-doping in the Thermoelectric Properties of Full-Heusler Fe2TiSn
Authors: Ilaria Pallecchi, Daniel I. Bilc, Marcella Pani, Fabio Ricci, Sebastien Lemal, Philippe Ghosez, Daniele Marre'
Abstract: The potential of Fe2TiSn full-Heusler compounds for thermoelectric applications has been suggested theoretically, but not yet grounded experimentally, due to the difficulty of obtaining reproducible, homogeneous, phase pure and defect free samples. In this work, we study Fe2TiSn1-xSbx polycrystals (x from 0 to 0.6), fabricated by high-frequency melting and long-time high-temperature annealing. We obtain fairly good phase purity, homogeneous microstructure and good matrix stoichiometry. Although intrinsic p-type transport behavior is dominant, n-type charge compensation by Sb doping is demonstrated. Calculations of formation energy of defects and electronic properties carried out in the density functional theory formalism reveal that charged iron vacancies VFe2- are the dominant defects responsible for the intrinsic p-type doping of Fe2TiSn in all types of growing conditions except Fe-rich. Additionally, Sb substitutions at Sn site give rise either to SbSn, SbSn1+ which are responsible for n-type doping and magnetism (SbSn) or to magnetic SbSn1- which act as additional p-type dopants. Our experimental data highlight good thermoelectric properties close to room temperature, with Seebeck coefficients up to 56 microV/K in the x=0.2 sample and power factors up to 4.8x10^-4 W m^-1 K^-2 in the x=0.1 sample. Our calculations indicate the appearance of a pseudogap in Ti-rich conditions and large Sb doping, possibly improving further the thermoelectric properties.

Title: Effect of laser field and magnetic flux on scattering in graphene quantum dots
Authors: Mohammed El Azar, Ahmed Bouhlal, Hocine Bahlouli, Ahmed Jellal
Abstract: We show how Dirac electrons interact with a graphene quantum dots (GQDs) when exposed to both a magnetic flux and circularly polarized light. After obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we compute the scattering coefficients. These allow us to show how efficiently the electrons diffuse and how their probability density is distributed in space. Our results show that light polarization is key in controlling electron scattering. It affects electron localization near the GQDs and the strength of the scattering coefficients. We also investigate how light intensity and magnetic flux affect the formation of quasi-bound states. In addition, the electrostatic potential reduces the density of scattering states and fine-tunes the interaction between electrons and the quantum dot. This research improves our understanding of electron behavior in graphene nanostructures and suggests new ways to control electronic states at the quantum level.

Title: Stability of Floquet sidebands and quantum coherence in 1D strongly interacting spinless fermions
Authors: Karun Gadge, Salvatore R. Manmana
Abstract: For strongly correlated quantum systems, fundamental questions about the formation and stability of Floquet-Bloch sidebands (FBs) upon periodic driving remain unresolved. Here, we investigate the impact of electron-electron interactions and perturbations in the coherence of the driving on the lifetime of FBs by directly addressing these questions in time-dependent single-particle spectral functions. Using exact diagonalization (ED) and matrix product states (MPS), we find for a chain of interacting spinless fermions that high-frequency driving leads to long-lived FBs of the full many-body excitation continuum, accompanied by in-gap modes related to mobile domain walls. Conversely, in the low-frequency regime and in the presence of noise, heating dominates, resulting in a significant loss of quantum coherence. This is further elucidated by the behaviour of real-space single-particle propagators, of the energy gain, and of the momentum distribution function, which is related to a quantum Fisher information that is directly accessible by spectroscopic measurements.

Title: Stabilization of magnetic bubbles in [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on an oxygen-reconstructed Nb(110) surface via an ultra-thin Cu interlayer
Authors: Ahmad Dibajeh, Cameron W. Johnson, Andreas K. Schmid, Roberto Lo Conte
Abstract: Magnetic thin films hosting topological spin textures, such as magnetic skyrmions, hold high potential for breakthroughs in the field of spintronics, due to good scalability and energy efficiency. Novel computational architectures such as memory-in-logic devices rely on material platforms able to host those topological spin textures. Furthermore, recently proposed designs of novel quantum information technologies are based on heterostructures where topological spin textures are in direct proximity to a superconducting layer. Here, we demonstrate the stabilization of out-of-plane magnetic bubbles in highly ordered [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers on a Nb(110) single crystal. This is achieved without the need for removal of the well-known Nb(110)-oxide surface reconstruction, due to the introduction of a one-atom-thick Cu interlayer in between the Nb substrate and the magnetic multilayer. The Cu interlayer generates a well-ordered hexagonal surface, which is key for the epitaxial growth of the [Ni/Co]$_{n}$ multilayers hosting the desired out-of-plane anisotropy. The magnetic ground state of the prepared material stacks is directly imaged via spin-polarized low energy electron microscopy (SPLEEM), revealing the presence of magnetic bubble domains with lateral sizes as small as 450 nm.

Title: A thin film source in a solid-state diffusion experiment: CoO on SrTiO3
Authors: Qian Ma, Jan Erik Rybak, Natalie Jacqueline Ottinger, Timo Kassubek, Jörg Hoffmann, Karl-Michael Weitzel, Cynthia A. Volkert, Christian Jooss
Abstract: To realize a chemical diffusion experiment for simple quantitative analysis of one-dimensional diffusion profiles requires the fabrication of a planar and chemically sharp interface between two phases, one serving as the diffusion source and the other as the material to be studied. We demonstrate a thin film source on top of single crystals or epitaxial films for the example of cobalt (II) oxide (CoO) grown on top of SrTiO3 (STO) by ion beam sputtering. After deposition at room temperature, a nanocrystalline film with flat and chemically sharp interface is present. Diffusion annealing leads to a partial formation of the Co3O4 phase and recrystallization accompanied by a strong increase of the surface and the interface roughness. We report the conditions, where compact and stable CoO layers with flat interface can be maintained, serving as a constant source for Co diffusion. Exemplarily, the formation of a Co-diffusion profile is demonstrated after annealing of 240 h at 1163 K and comparatively studied by using three different methods: Energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX) in a transmission electron microscope (TEM), atom probe tomography (APT) and time of flight secondary ion mass spectroscopy (TOF SIMS). Local and rather macroscopic concentration profiling do well agree within error.

Title: Machine learning exploration of topological polarization pattern in hexagonal boron nitride moiré superlattice
Authors: Jun-Ding Zheng, Cheng-Shi Yao, Song-Chuan Zhou, Yu-Ke Zhang, Zhi-Qiang Bao, Wen-Yi Tong, Jun-Hao Chu, Chun-Gang Duan
Abstract: Twisted moiré supercells, which can be approximated as a combination of sliding bilayers and constitute various topologically nontrivial polarization patterns, attract extensive attention recently. However, because of the excessive size of the moiré supercell, most studies are based on effective models and lack the results of first-principles calculation. In this work, we use machine learning to determine the topological structure of the polarization pattern in twisted and strained bilayer of hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN). We further confirm that the topological pattern can be effectively modulated by the vertical electric field and lattice mismatch. Finally, local polarization also exists in the antiparallel stacked h-BN twisted and strained bilayers. Our work provides a detailed study of the polarization pattern in the moiré superlattice, which we believe can facilitate more research in moiré ferroelectricity, topological physics, and related fields.

Title: Probing dielectric breakdown in Mott insulators through current oscillations
Authors: Joan Triadú-Galí, Artur Garcia-Saez, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Axel Pérez-Obiol
Abstract: We investigate the dielectric breakdown of mesoscopic Mott insulators, a phenomenon where a strong electric field destabilizes the insulating state, resulting in a transition to a metallic phase. Using the Landau-Zener formalism, which models the excitation of a two-level system, we derive a theoretical expression for the threshold value of the field. To validate our predictions, we present an efficient protocol for estimating the charge gap and threshold field via non-equilibrium current oscillations, overcoming the computational limitations of exact diagonalization. Our simulations demonstrate the accuracy of our theoretical formula for systems with small gaps. Moreover, our findings are directly testable in ultracold atomic experiments with ring geometries and artificial gauge fields, as our method uses measurable quantities and relies on already available technologies. This work aims to bridge the gap between theoretical models and experimentally realizable protocols, providing tools to explore non-equilibrium mesoscopic phenomena in strongly correlated quantum systems.

Title: 2D Layered Heterojunctions for Photoelectrocatalysis
Authors: Mengjiao Wang, Michal Langer, Roberto Altieri, Matteo Crisci, Silvio Osella, Teresa Gatti
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) layered nanomaterials heterostructures, arising from the combination of 2D materials with other low-dimensional species, feature large surface area to volume ratio, which provides a high density of active sites for catalytic ap-plications and in particular for (photo)electrocatalysis (PEC). Meanwhile, their unique electronic band structure and high electrical conductivity enable efficient charge transfer (CT) between the active material and the substrate, which is essential for catalytic activity. In recent years, researchers have demonstrated the potential of a range of 2D material interfaces, such as graphene, graphitic carbon nitride (g-C3N4), metal chalcogenides (MCs), and MXenes, for (photo)electrocatalytic applica-tions. For instance, MCs such as MoS2 and WS2 have shown excellent catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution, while gra-phene and MXenes have been used for the reduction of carbon dioxide to higher value chemicals. However, despite their great potential, there are still major challenges that need to be addressed in order to fully realize the potential of 2D materials for PEC. For example, their stability under harsh reaction conditions, as well as their scalability for large-scale production are important factors to be considered. Generating heterojunctions (HJs) by combining 2D layered structures with other na-nomaterials is a promising method to improve the photoelectrocatalytic properties of the former. In this review, we inspect thoroughly the recent literature, to demonstrate the significant potential that arises from utilizing 2D layered heterostructures in PEC processes across a broad spectrum of applications, from energy conversion and storage to environmental remediation. With the ongoing research and development, it is likely that the potential of these materials will be fully expressed in the near future.

Title: Relaxation dynamics of a quantum spin coupled to a topological edge state
Authors: Qiyu Liu, Christoph Karrasch, Dante Marvin Kennes, Roman Rausch
Abstract: A classical impurity spin coupled to the spinful Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain is known to exhibit complex switching dynamics with incomplete spin relaxation. Here, we study the corrections that result from a full quantum treatment of the impurity spin. We find that in the topologically trivial case, the quantum spin behaves similarly to the classical one due to the absence of the Kondo effect for the trivial insulator. In the topological case, the quantum spin is significantly less likely to relax: It can be stuck at a pre-relaxation plateau with a sizable deviation from the expected relaxed value, and there is a large parameter regime where it does not relax at all but features an anomalously large Larmor frequency. Furthermore, we find an additional quantum effect where the pre-relaxation plateau can be hyperpolarized, i.e., the spin is stuck at a polarization value larger than the ground-state expectation value. This is possible due to the (incomplete) Kondo screening of the quantum spin, which is absent in the classical case. Our results are obtained via the ground state density matrix renormalization group algorithm and the time-dependent variational principle, where the charge-SU(2) symmetry of the problem was exploited. Furthermore, we introduce and benchmark a method to predict the dynamics from the given numerical data based on the sparse identification of nonlinear dynamics (SINDy). This allows us to prolong the simulation timescale by a factor of 2.5, up to a maximal time of $10^3$ inverse hoppings.

Title: No time for surface charge: how bulk conductivity hides charge patterns from KPFM in contact-electrified surfaces
Authors: Felix Pertl, Isaac C.D. Lenton, Tobias Cramer, Scott Waitukaitis
Abstract: Kelvin probe force microscopy (KPFM) is a powerful tool for studying contact electrification, using an tiny tip to image voltages caused by transferred charge. It has been used in stationary studies focused on finding patterns (e.g. heterogeneity) in transferred charge, but also in dynamic studies aimed at understanding how charge escapes. Here, we show that the charge dynamics in all but the very best insulators are too fast for patterns found in stationary studies to be meaningful. Using a custom-built system, we are able to quickly (~30 s) transfer samples from our contact-charging apparatus to the atomic force microscopy (AFM). For materials at the lower end of `good insulators', we see potential decay that is shorter than the timescale of a typical KPFM scan (~10 minutes). We develop a minimal model to explain this decay based on bulk conductivity, and show that the measured timescale increases with the prediction from this model. To rule out surface conductivity, we perform additional experiments with the macroscopic method of scanning Kelvin probe microscopy. Our results highlight an important but widely overlooked consideration for dynamic vs. stationary studies in contact-electrified surfaces, and suggest that some patterns observed in the latter, e.g. charge heterogeneity, are not as widespread as previously thought.

Title: Realization of strain induced multiple topological phases in Cu$_2$SnS$_3$: An $ab$-$initio$ study
Authors: Prakash Pandey, Sudhir K. Pandey
Abstract: The search of multiple topological phases (TPs) and their transitions by tuning different parameters through chemical substitutions, electric field, magnetic field, strain and Floquet engineering, etc has garnered a widespread attention in recent time. In spite of great effort, the observations of multiple TPs in a single material and multiple TP transitions in the presence of one parameter remain elusive. Here we demonstrate the presence of multiple TPs and their transitions with uniaxial compressive strain (UCS) in orthorhombic Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ by using $state$-$of$-$the$-$art$ $ab$-$initio$ calculations. In the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC), the Cu$_2$SnS$_3$ exhibits a single (type-II) nodal-ring and in the presence of SOC, it hosts Weyl phase with seven Weyl points (three at $\Gamma$ and four at general positions) along with nodal arcs. On the application of UCS, it remains type-II nodal-ring $<5.5$\%, which further evolves into type-III nodal-ring for $5.5\% \leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%. Interestingly, at 5.6\% of UCS, it shows Weyl phase with four Weyl nodes even in the absence of SOC. All the above-mentioned seven Weyl points persist below $5$\% of UCS. For 5\% $\leq$ UCS $<5.6$\%, four Weyl points (at general positions) disappear and nodal-arcs remain intact in all the studied range of UCS. The TPs observed in the absence of SOC appears to arise due to the presence of strain driven topological flat band, which is typically reported to be seen in kagome and Lieb lattices.

Title: Form and function in biological filaments: A physicist's review
Authors: Jan Cammann, Hannah Laeverenz-Schlogelhofer, Kirsty Y. Wan, Marco G. Mazza
Abstract: Nature uses elongated shapes and filaments to build stable structures, generate motion, and allow complex geometric interactions. In this Review, we examine the role of biological filaments across different length scales. From the molecular scale, where cytoskeletal filaments provides a robust but dynamic cellular scaffolding, over the scale of cellular appendages like cilia and flagella, to the scale of filamentous microorganisms like cyanobacteria which are among the most successful genera on Earth, and even to the scale of elongated animals like worms and snakes, whose motility modes inspire robotic analogues. We highlight the general mechanisms that couple form and function. Physical principles, such as classical elasticity and the non-reciprocity of active matter can be used to trace unifying themes linking these systems spanning about six orders of magnitude in length.

Title: Antisymmetry rules of response properties in certain chemical spaces
Authors: Takafumi Shiraogawa, Simon León Krug, Masahiro Ehara, O. Anatole von Lilienfeld
Abstract: Understanding chemical compound space (CCS), a set of molecules and materials, is crucial for the rational discovery of molecules and materials. Concepts of symmetry have recently been introduced into CCS to account for near degeneracies and differences in electronic energies between iso-electronic materials. In this work, we present approximate relationships of response properties based on a first-principles view of CCS. They have been derived from perturbation theory and antisymmetry considerations involving nuclear charges. These rules allow approximate predictions of relative response properties of pairs of distinct compounds with opposite nuclear charge variations from a highly symmetric reference material, without the need for experiments or quantum chemical calculations of each compound. We numerically and statistically verified these rules for electric and magnetic response properties (electric dipole moment, polarizabilities, hyperpolarizabilities, and magnetizabilities) among charge-neutral and iso-electronic BN-doped polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon derivatives of naphthalene, anthracene, and pyrene. Our analysis indicates that, despite their simplicity, antisymmetry rule-based predictions are remarkably accurate, enabling dimensionality reduction of CCS. Response properties in alchemical perturbation density functional theory were investigated to clarify the origin of this predictive power. The origin of this predictive power was clarified based on alchemical perturbation density functional theory.

Title: Ultrafast annealing process of MTJ using hybrid microwave annealing
Authors: Ming-Chun Hsu, Fan-Yun Chiu, Wei-Chi Aeneas Hsu, Chang-Shan Shen, Kun-Ping Huang, Tsun-Hsu Chang
Abstract: This paper discovers that the magnetic tunnel junction (MTJ) structure is successfully magnetized with hybrid microwave annealing, confirmed by the tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) and Coercivity (Hc) results. Hybrid microwave annealing can transform CoFeB into a single crystal and form the Fe-O bond at the interface between CoFeB and MgO without adding an extra magnet. The annealing time is significantly reduced from the original 120 minutes to just 1 minute, allowing for rapid low-temperature annealing of the MTJ structure. The TEM results are used to determine the change in the lattice structure of CoFeB from amorphous to a single crystal, and the EELS result indicates the diffusion distribution of atoms in the MTJ structure. This hybrid annealing process can save a significant amount of fabrication time and is an energy-efficient alternative to the current fabrication process of MRAM.

Title: Anomalous exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entangled Nambu spinors
Authors: Hai-Dong Li, Wei Chen
Abstract: Entanglement of spin degree of freedom can drastically alter the orbital exchange symmetry of electrons, switching their bunching and antibunching behaviors and the resultant current correlations in the Hanbury-Brown-Twiss interferometry. Here, we investigate the exchange correlation of quasiparticles with entanglement encoded in the Nambu spinors, or the electron-hole degree of freedom. In contrast to the conventional correspondence between spin entanglement and current correlation, we find that singlet (triplet) entanglement of Nambu spinors results in suppressed (enhanced) current correlation. This effect arises because the charge degree of freedom itself encodes the entanglement. We propose implementing this phenomenon in the edge states of a quantum Hall system, where the entangled states of the Nambu spinors can be continuously tuned by gate voltages. Our study reveals a novel relationship between entanglement and charge correlations, offering an effective approach for detecting entanglement of Nambu spinors.

Title: Enhancement of persistent current in a non-Hermitian disordered ring
Authors: Suparna Sarkar, Soumya Satpathi, Swapan K. Pati
Abstract: We have studied the Aharonov-Bohm flux-induced magnetic response of a disordered non-Hermitian ring. The disorder is introduced through an on-site quasiperiodic potential described by the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model, incorporating a complex phase that renders the model non-Hermitian. Our findings reveal that this form of non-Hermiticity enhances the persistent current, without requiring hopping dimerization. We explore both non-interacting and interacting scenarios. In the former, we examine spinless fermions, while in the latter, we consider fermions with Hubbard interactions. The Non-Hermitian phase induces both the real and imaginary components of the current. We thoroughly analyze the energy eigenspectrum, ground state energy, and persistent current in both real and imaginary spaces for various system parameters. Our primary goal is to investigate the combined effects of non-Hermiticity and disorder strength on persistent currents. We find an enhancement in both the real and imaginary components of the persistent current with increasing disorder strength, as well as the non-Hermiticity, up to a critical value. Furthermore, we observe an enhancement in persistent current in the presence of Hubbard correlation. Our findings may provide a new route to get nontrivial characteristics in persistent current for a special type of non-Hermitian systems.

Title: Effect of Annealing on Al Diffusion and its Impact on the Properties of Ga$_2$O$_3$ Thin Films Deposited on c-plane Sapphire by RF Sputtering
Authors: Ana Sofia Sousa, Duarte M. Esteves, Tiago T. Robalo, Mário S. Rodrigues, Luís F. Santos, Katharina Lorenz, Marco Peres
Abstract: Gallium oxide is a wide-bandgap semiconductor which has been steadily growing in popularity due to its ultra-wide bandgap, suitability for harsh environments and distinctive opto-electrical properties. Notable applications include deep-UV photodetectors, low loss waveguides or even transparent solar cells. RF sputtering stands out among possible techniques for the epitaxial deposition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ thin films with high quality and at a low cost. By using sapphire substrates, and through thermal annealing, we can form a $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy by Al diffusion, which has tunable opto-electrical properties such as the bandgap and breakdown electric field. In this work, techniques such as X-ray diffraction, Rutherford backscattering spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, atomic force microscopy and optical transmission are used to determine the optical properties, morphology and composition of Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ deposited and annealed thin films. To explore the formation of the $\beta$-(Al$_{x}$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_{2}$O$_{3}$ alloy, annealing was performed at variable temperature, in ambient air. It was determined that the bandgap can indeed be tuned between 4.85 and 5.30 eV by varying the annealing temperature, corresponding to an Al content between 0$-$68.5.

Title: Orientation Dependent Resistivity Scaling in Mesoscopic NbP Crystals
Authors: Gianluca Mariani, Federico Balduini, Nathan Drucker, Lorenzo Rocchino, Vicky Hasse, Claudia Felser, Heinz Schmid, Cezar Zota, Bernd Gotsmann
Abstract: The scaling of Si transistor technology has resulted in a remarkable improvement in the performance of integrated circuits over the last decades. However, scaled transistors also require reduced electrical interconnect dimensions, which lead to greater losses and power dissipation at circuit level. This is mainly caused by enhanced surface scattering of charge carriers in copper interconnect wires at dimensions below 30 nm. A promising approach to mitigate this issue is to use directional conductors, i.e. materials with anisotropic Fermi surface, where proper alignment of crystalline orientation and transport direction can minimize surface scattering. In this work, we perform a resistivity scaling study of the anisotropic semimetal NbP as a function of crystalline orientation. We use here focused ion beam to pattern and scale down NbP crystallites to dimensions comparable to the electron scattering length at cryogenic temperatures. The experimental transport properties are correlated with the Fermi surface characteristics through a theoretical model, thus identifying the physical mechanisms that influence the resistivity scaling of anisotropic conductors. Our methodology provides an effective approach for early evaluation of anisotropic materials as future ultra-scalable interconnects, even when they are unavailable as epitaxial films.

Title: Delta-function-potential junctions with quasiparticles occupying tilted bands with quadratic-in-momentum dispersion
Authors: Ipsita Mandal
Abstract: We continue our explorations of the transport characteristics in junction-configurations comprising semimetals with quadratic band-crossings, observed in the bandstructures of both two- and three-dimensional materials. Here, we consider short potential barriers/wells modelled by delta-function potentials. We also generalize our analysis by incorporating tilts in the dispersion. Due to the parabolic nature of the spectra, caused by quadratic-in-momentum dependence, there exist evanescent waves, which decay exponentially as we move away from the junction represented by the location of the delta-function potential. Investigating the possibility of the appearance of bound states, we find that their energies appear as pairs of $\pm |E_b |$, reflecting the presence of the imaginary-valued wavevectors at both positive and negative values of energies of the propagating quasiparticles.

Title: Fabrication and characterization of bimetallic silica-based and 3D-printed active colloidal cubes
Authors: Silvana A. Caipa Cure, Daniela J. Kraft
Abstract: Simulations on self-propelling active cubes reveal interesting behaviors at both the individual and the collective level, emphasizing the importance of developing experimental analogs that allow to test these theoretical predictions. The majority of experimental realizations of active colloidal cubes rely on light actuation and or magnetic fields to have a persistent active mechanism, and lack material versatility. Here we propose a system of active bimetallic cubes whose propulsion mechanism is based on a catalytic reaction and study their behavior. We realize such a system from synthetic silica cuboids and 3D printed micro cubes, followed by the deposition of gold and platinum layers on their surface. We characterize the colloids dynamics for different thicknesses of the gold layer at low and high hydrogen peroxide concentrations. We show that the thickness of the base gold layer has only a minor effect on the self propulsion speed and in addition induces a gravitational torque which leads to particles with a velocity director pointing out of the plane thus effectively suppressing propulsion. We find that a higher active force can remedy the effects of torque, resulting in particle orientations that are favorable for in plane propulsion. Finally, we use 3D printing to compare our results to cubes made from a different material, size and roundness, and demonstrate that the speed scaling with increasing particle size originates from the size-dependent drag. Our experiments extend fabrication of active cubes to different materials and propulsion mechanisms and highlight that the design of active particles with anisotropic shapes requires consideration of the interplay between the shape and activity to achieve favorable sedimentation and efficient in plane propulsion.

Title: Evidence for topological origin of large spin-shift current in antiferromagnetic Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$
Authors: Ali Sufyan, Hasan M. Abdullah, J. Andreas Larsson, Alexander C. Tyner
Abstract: The shift current is a non-linear photocurrent generally associated with the underlying quantum geometry. However, a topological origin for the shift photocurrent in non-centrosymmetric systems has recently been proposed. The corresponding topological classification goes beyond the ten-fold paradigm and is associated with the presence of a reverting Thouless pump (RTP). In this work we examine an antiferromagnetic monolayer within the family of MXenes, Ti$_{4}$C$_{3}$. This material is centrosymmetric, however, magnetic ordering violates inversion symmetry. We demonstrate evidence of an RTP in each spin-sector which has been perturbed, destroying quantization of the invariant. Nevertheless, a giant spin-resolved shift current persists. We further investigate the mid-gap edge states and classification of the system as a fragile topological insulator to which trivial bands have been coupled.

Title: Predictive simulations of the dynamical response of mesoscopic devices
Authors: Samuel Boutin, Torsten Karzig, Tareq El Dandachi, Ryan V. Mishmash, Jan Gukelberger, Roman M. Lutchyn, Bela Bauer
Abstract: As the complexity of mesoscopic quantum devices increases, simulations are becoming an invaluable tool for understanding their behavior. This is especially true for the superconductor-semiconductor heterostructures used to build Majorana-based topological qubits, where quantitatively understanding the interplay of topological superconductivity, disorder, semiconductor quantum dots, Coulomb blockade and noise has been essential for progress on device design and interpretation of measurements. In this paper, we describe a general framework to simulate the low-energy quantum dynamics of such complex systems. We illustrate our approach by computing the dispersive gate sensing (DGS) response of quantum dots coupled to topological superconductors. We start by formulating the DGS response as an open-system quantum dynamics problem, which allows a consistent treatment of drive backaction as well as quantum and classical noise. For microscopic quantum problems subject to Coulomb-blockade, where a direct solution in the exponentially large many-body Hilbert space would be prohibitive, we introduce a series of controlled approximations that incorporate ideas from tensor network theory and quantum chemistry to reduce this Hilbert space to a few low-energy degrees of freedom that accurately capture the low-energy quantum dynamics. We demonstrate the methods introduced in this paper on the example of a single quantum dot coupled to a topological superconductor and a microscopic realization of the fermion parity readout setup of Aghaee et al. arXiv:2401.09549 (2024).

Title: Fluorescent molecular rotor-based polymer materials for local microviscosity mapping in microfluidic channels
Authors: Dharshana Nalatamby, Florence Gibouin, Maxime Zitouni, Julien Renaudeau, Gérald Clisson, Pierre Lidon, Simon Harrisson, Yaocihuatl Medina-Gonzalez
Abstract: A viscosity-sensitive monomer consisting of a methacrylate-functionalized julolidone-based molecular rotor (MECVJ) was synthesized and used to obtain viscosity-sensitive polymers (poly(DMA-\textit{s}-MECVJ)). The qualitative properties of the molecular rotor were preserved after its inclusion in the new polymer, in particular the effect of the viscosity of the surrounding medium on the fluorescence lifetime of the rotor. By grafting these polymers onto glass slides, viscosity-sensitive surfaces were obtained, showing good robustness in time after successive use and washing. As proof of concept, these surfaces were used to assemble a microfluidic chip capable of mapping viscosity of fluids flowing inside the channel.

Title: Bipolaron dynamics in the one-dimensional SSH model
Authors: Filip Marijanović, Yi-Fan Qu, Eugene Demler
Abstract: Characterizing bipolaron binding, and understanding how it depends on electron-phonon interaction, is crucial to unraveling the nature of emergent many-body states in strongly interacting electron-phonon systems. So far, most studies of bipolarons have been limited to the Holstein model, in which the coupling constant is momentum-independent. The paradigmatic example of momentum-dependent electron-phonon interaction comes from the system in which phonon distortions modify electron hopping, the SSH model. Already individual polarons in the SSH model are richer than the Holstein model counterparts, and feature a phase transition into the finite momentum ground state with increasing electron-phonon interaction. In this paper, we use a variational approach to study bipolarons in the one-dimensional SSH model and discuss their ground state, dispersion, and excitation spectra. We explore the full parameter range of the system, including the adiabatic regime of slow phonons, which was inaccessible to previous theoretical studies. In agreement with earlier studies, we find that in the anti-adiabatic strongly interacting regime, bipolarons have low effective mass. By contrast, in the adiabatic case, we find that increasing electron-phonon interactions results in an exponential increase of the bipolaron mass. We establish the existence of multiple branches of bound excited states of SSH bipolaron and discuss the signatures of these bound states in dynamics. We show that in the anti-adiabatic regime, response functions obey a parity selection rule, that imposes symmetry constraints on the excitation spectra and provides a clear signature of SSH bipolarons.

Title: Artificially creating emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism and its manipulation in a magnetic van-der-Waals heterostructure
Authors: Xiangqi Wang, Cong Wang, Yupeng Wang, Chunhui Ye, Azizur Rahman, Min Zhang, Suhan Son, Jun Tan, Zengming Zhang, Wei Ji, Je-Geun Park, Kai-Xuan Zhang
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) magnets, with their two-dimensional (2D) atomic structures, provide a unique platform for exploring magnetism at the nanoscale. Although there have been numerous reports on their diverse quantum properties, the emergent interfacial magnetism--artificially created at the interface between two layered magnets--remains largely unexplored. This work presents observations of such emergent interfacial magnetism at the ferromagnet/antiferromagnet interface in a vdW heterostructure. We report the discovery of an intermediate Hall resistance plateau in the anomalous Hall loop, indicative of emergent interfacial antiferromagnetism fostered by the heterointerface. This plateau can be stabilized and further manipulated under varying pressures but collapses under high pressures over 10 GPa. Our theoretical calculations reveal that charge transfer at the interface is pivotal in establishing the interlayer antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interaction. This work illuminates the previously unexplored emergent interfacial magnetism at a vdW interface comprised of a ferromagnetic metal and an antiferromagnetic insulator, and highlights its gradual evolution under increasing pressure. These findings enrich the portfolio of emergent interfacial magnetism and support further investigations on vdW magnetic interfaces and the development of next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Dielectric-Dependent Range-Separated Hybrid Functional Calculations for Metal Oxides
Authors: Jiawei Zhan, Marco Govoni, Giulia Galli
Abstract: Recently, we introduced the screened-exchange range-separated hybrid (SE-RSH) functional to account for spatially dependent dielectric screening in complex materials. The SE-RSH functional has shown good performance in predicting the electronic properties of a large variety of semiconductors and insulators, and of heterogeneous systems composed of building blocks with large dielectric mismatch. Here, we assess the performance of SE-RSH for oxide materials, including antiferromagnetic transition-metal oxides. Through a comparison with other dielectric-dependent hybrid functionals, we demonstrate that SE-RSH yields improved predictions of dielectric constants and band gaps, bringing them into a closer agreement with experimental values. The functional also provides accurate values of magnetic moments of several oxides.

Title: Stripe-like correlations in the cuprates from oxygen NMR
Authors: Daniel Bandur, Abigail Lee, Stefan Tsankov, Andreas Erb, Juergen Haase
Abstract: Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) of planar oxygen, with its family independent phenomenology, is ideally suited to probe the nature of the quantum matter of superconducting cuprates. Here, with new experiments on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$, in particular also at high doping levels, we report on short-range stripe-like correlations between local charge and spin. Their amplitudes at room temperature are nearly independent of doping up to at least $x=0.30$, only their relative phase slips near $x=1/4$. Comparisons show the correlations to be generic to the cuprates. Despite the atomic scale length, the variations still resemble the average spin and charge relation, which is not expected from the otherwise simple, apparently metallic behavior, even far into the overdoped regime. Perhaps the phase slip is at the heart of a quantum critical point that demands pseudogap behavior towards lower doping levels in an otherwise strange metal.

Title: UV photodetectors and field-effect transistors based on $β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ nanomembranes produced by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation
Authors: Miguel Cardoso Pedro, Duarte Magalhães Esteves, Daniela Rodrigues Pereira, Luís Cerqueira Alves, Chamseddine Bouhafs, Katharina Lorenz, Marco Peres
Abstract: $\beta$-Ga$_{2}$O$_{3}$ nanomembranes, obtained by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation, are used in the fabrication of simple metal-semiconductor-metal (MSM) structures, that are tested as photodetectors (PD) and field-effect transistors (FET). Ti/Au contacts to the membrane are found to be rectifying. However, through thermal treatment in a nitrogen atmosphere for one minute at 500 °C, it is possible to modify this junction to have an ohmic behavior. An MSM PD is studied, reaching a high responsivity of 2.6$\times$10$^{4}$ A/W and a detectivity of 2.4$\times$10$^{14}$ Jones, under 245 nm wavelength illumination, and an applied voltage of 40 V. In order to better understand the behavior of the two junctions, in particular the iono/photocurrent mechanisms, an ion microprobe system is used to assess the response of these PD when excitation is localized in the different regions of the device. Finally, a depletion-mode FET is obtained, with an on/off current ratio of 7.7$\times$10$^{7}$ in the linear regime, at a drain-to-source voltage of 5 V, and with a threshold voltage around $-$3 V. The success in obtaining FET, and most notably, MSM photodetectors, while using a simple device structure, indicates a great potential of the nanomembranes produced by ion-beam-assisted exfoliation for the development of high-performance devices.

Title: Spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack
Authors: Luca Maranzana, Maxim Mostovoy, Naoto Nagaosa, Sergey Artyukhin
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are particle-like spin textures with a nontrivial topology, which ensures their stability even at the nanometer scale. This feature establishes skyrmions as promising information carriers for novel magnetic storage and processing devices, e.g., racetrack memories. However, their fate in various magnetic backgrounds is poorly understood. Here, we show that spiral multiferroics, some of the simplest noncollinear magnets, host bimerons -- skyrmionic textures formed by vortex-antivortex pairs. The bimeron carries magnetic and ferroelectric dipole moments that remarkably depend on its position relative to the spiral background. This property enables precise positioning of the bimeron using a slowly rotating magnetic field, as a $2\pi$ field rotation shifts the bimeron by one spiral period. We also investigate the non-adiabatic regime that occurs when the rotation frequency exceeds a critical threshold. The results establish a new paradigm in which the background endows topological spin textures with unique functionalities, highlighting spiral multiferroics as a natural skyrmion racetrack.

Title: Generalized Polarization and time-resolved fluorescence provide evidence for different populations of Laurdan in lipid vesicles
Authors: M. Bacalum, M. Radu, S. Osella, S. Knippenberg, M. Ameloot
Abstract: The solvatochromic dye Laurdan is widely used in sensing the lipid packing of both model and biological membranes. The fluorescence emission maximum shifts from about 440 nm (blue channel) in condensed membranes (So) to about 490 nm (green channel) in the liquid-crystalline phase (L{\alpha}). Although the fluorescence intensity based generalized polarization (GP) is widely used to characterize lipid membranes, the fluorescence lifetime of Laurdan, in the blue and the green channel, is less used for that purpose. Here we explore the correlation between GP and fluorescence lifetimes by spectroscopic measurements on the So and L{\alpha} phases of large unilamellar vesicles of DMPC and DPPC. A positive correlation between GP and the lifetimes is observed in each of the optical channels for the two lipid phases. Fluorescence intensities, GP and fluorescence lifetimes depend on the angle between the orientation of the linear polarization of the excitation light and the local normal to the membrane of the optical cross-section. This angular variation depends on the lipid phase and the emission channel. GP and fluorescence intensities in the blue and green channel in So and in the blue channel in L{\alpha} exhibit a minimum near 90o. Surprisingly, the intensity in the green channel in L{\alpha} reaches a maximum near 90o. The fluorescence lifetimes in the two optical channels also reach a pronounced minimum near 90o in So and L{\alpha}, apart from the lifetime in the blue channel in L{\alpha} where the lifetime is short with minimal angular variation. To our knowledge, these experimental observations are the first to demonstrate the existence of a bent conformation of Laurdan in lipid membranes, as previously suggested by molecular dynamics calculations.

Title: Dynamical pathways for the interaction of O2, H2O, CH4, and CO2 with a-alumina surfaces: Density functional tight-binding calculations
Authors: F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, Amil Aligayev, Wenyi Huo, Muralidhar Chourashiya, Qinqin Xu, Stefanos Papanikolaou
Abstract: In this study, we investigated the physisorption mechanisms of O2, H2O, CH4, and CO2 molecules on alumina and their effect on electronic properties. We employed quantum-classical molecular dynamics simulations and the self-consistent-charge density-functional tight-binding (SCC-DFTB) approach to dynamically model these mechanisms. Our results revealed the binding pathways of O, H, and C atoms in the various molecules to Al and O atoms at the top atomic layers of the alpha-alumina surface. We examined several adsorption sites and molecular orientations relative to Al-terminated and Ox-terminated alumina surfaces and found that the most stable physisorbed state on the Al-terminated surface is located above the Al atom, while the Ox-terminated state is found above the oxygen, resulting in enhanced optical adsorbance. The dissociation of CH4 into CH2+H2 after interaction with the surface resulted in hydrogen production, but with low adsorbate rates. While, O2 molecules primarily bond to the Al atoms, leading to the highest adsorbance rate among the other molecules. Our findings provide important insights into the physisorption mechanisms of molecules on alumina and their impact on electronic properties

Title: Hydrodynamic stability and pattern formation in hexatic epithelial layers
Authors: Josep-Maria Armengol-Collado, Leonardo Puggioni, Livio N. Carenza, Luca Giomi
Abstract: We investigate the hydrodynamic stability and the formation of patterns in a continuum model of epithelial layers, able to account for the interplay between mechanical activity, lateral adhesion and the $6-$fold orientational order originating from the hexagonal morphology of the cells. Unlike in other models of active liquid crystals, the balance between energy injection and dissipation can here involve multiple length scales, resulting in a large spectrum of dynamical behaviors. When kinetic energy is dissipated by the cells' adhesive interactions at a rate higher that at which is injected by active stresses, the quiescent state of the cellular layer is generically stable: i.e. hydrodynamically stable regardless of its size. On the other hand, as the cellular layer becomes progressively more active, this homeostatic condition is altered by a hierarchy of pattern-forming instabilities, where the system organizes in an increasingly large number of counter-flowing lanes of fixed width. In two-dimensional periodic domains, the latter organization is itself unstable to the proliferation of vortices and the dynamics of the cellular layer becomes eventually chaotic and yet different from the more common active turbulence.

Title: Statistical Uncertainties of Limit Cycle Systems in Langevin Bath
Authors: Dipesh K. Singh, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: We show that limit cycle systems in Langevin bath exhibit uncertainty in observables that define the limit-cycle plane, and maintain a positive lower bound. The uncertainty-bound depends on the parameters that determine the shape and periodicity of the limit cycle. In one dimension, we use the framework of canonical dissipative systems to construct the limit cycle, whereas in two dimensions, particle in central potentials with radial-dissipation provide us natural examples. We show that, the position-momenta uncertainty of particle in a central potential is larger than half the magnitude of the angular momentum (conserved) of the particle. We also investigate how uncertainties, which are absent in deterministic systems, increase with time when the systems are attached to a bath and eventually cross the lower bound before reaching the steady state.

Abstract: We describe a concrete device roadmap towards a fault-tolerant quantum computing architecture based on noise-resilient, topologically protected Majorana-based qubits. Our roadmap encompasses four generations of devices: a single-qubit device that enables a measurement-based qubit benchmarking protocol; a two-qubit device that uses measurement-based braiding to perform single-qubit Clifford operations; an eight-qubit device that can be used to show an improvement of a two-qubit operation when performed on logical qubits rather than directly on physical qubits; and a topological qubit array supporting lattice surgery demonstrations on two logical qubits. Devices that enable this path require a superconductor-semiconductor heterostructure that supports a topological phase, quantum dots and coupling between those quantum dots that can create the appropriate loops for interferometric measurements, and a microwave readout system that can perform fast, low-error single-shot measurements. We describe the key design components of these qubit devices, along with the associated protocols for demonstrations of single-qubit benchmarking, Clifford gate execution, quantum error detection, and quantum error correction, which differ greatly from those in more conventional qubits. Finally, we comment on implications and advantages of this architecture for utility-scale quantum computation.

Title: Many-body and QED effects in electron-atom inelastic scattering in EELS
Authors: Ioannis Iatrakis, Valerii Brudanin
Abstract: The elemental composition and electronic structure analysis of materials in Electron Energy Loss Spectroscopy (EELS) is probed by the inner shell ionization of atoms. This is a localized process in the material which can be well approximated by the scattering of a beam electron from a free atom. The inelastic differential cross section is calculated in the context of Quantum Electrodynamics (QED). The interaction of the incoming electron with the atom factorizes and it is treated perturbatively in QED. The atomic transition currents are calculated in the context of the relaxed Dirac-Hartree-Fock method. Correlation effects, which are induced by the relaxation of the atomic orbitals due to the created core-hole, are analyzed. Such effects are particularly important for quantum many-body systems and they are shown to have important impact on the shape of the differential cross section near the ionization threshold in Electron Energy Loss Spectra. In addition to the ionization spectrum, we calculate the excitation spectrum of Sc and Dy oxides using the crystal field multiplet theory. The calculation is compared to experimental EELS data and shows good agreement.

Title: Extracting the topological spins from bulk multipartite entanglement
Authors: Yarden Sheffer, Ady Stern, Erez Berg
Abstract: We address the problem of identifying a 2+1d topologically ordered phase using measurements on the ground-state wavefunction. For non-chiral topological order, we describe a series of bulk multipartite entanglement measures that extract the invariants $\sum_a d_a^2 \theta_a^r$ for any $r \geq 2$, where $d_a$ and $\theta_a$ are the quantum dimension and topological spin of an anyon $a$, respectively. These invariants are obtained as expectation values of permutation operators between $2r$ replicas of the wavefunction, applying different permutations on four distinct regions of the plane. Our proposed measures provide a refined tool for distinguishing topological phases, capturing information beyond conventional entanglement measures such as the topological entanglement entropy. We argue that any operator capable of extracting the above invariants must act on at least $2r$ replicas, making our procedure optimal in terms of the required number of replicas. We discuss the generalization of our results to chiral states.

Title: Impurity-induced non-unitary criticality
Authors: Heng-Hsi Li, Kuang-Hung Chou, Xueda Wen, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: Quantum impurities give rise to rich physical phenomena, with some exhibiting critical behavior described by conformal field theories (CFTs) in the low-energy limit. In parallel, party-time ($\mathcal{PT}$) symmetric non-Hermitian systems host exceptional points (EPs) at criticality, leading to exotic features governed by non-unitary CFTs. Here, we establish a connection between non-Hermitian impurities and CFTs by demonstrating that the critical properties of a (1+1)-dimensional free-fermion chain with central charge $c=1$ can be drastically altered by the presence of a local non-Hermitian impurity. Through a systematic analysis of entanglement/Rényi entropy, the finite-size scaling of the many-body spectrum, and fidelity susceptibility, we identify that this impurity-induced non-Hermitian criticality is characterized by a non-unitary CFT with central charge $c=-2$. Furthermore, we find that these non-unitary critical properties exhibit strong sensitivity to boundary conditions.

Title: Directional optical parametric amplification in a hyperbolic metamaterial
Authors: Antonio Gianfrate, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Paolo Comaron, Dawid Paszko, Marzena Szymańska, Milena De Giorgi, Dario Ballarini, Daniele Sanvitto
Abstract: Optical parametric amplification (OPA) comprises essentially a nonlinear four-wave mixing process in which a "pump" and a "signal" field give rise to an "idler" field under certain phase-matching conditions. Here we use a photonic crystal waveguide strongly-coupled with an excitonic reservoir to generate this process between different guided modes at optical wavelengths. Differently from classical nonlinear optical crystals, where the pump and idler photons travel almost collinearly, our exciton-polaritons are naturally separated in the waveguide due to their opposite group velocities. Due to the high efficiency of the process we can generate the idler field of the parametric process by pumping with a continuous wave laser and choose its direction of propagation in the waveguide by adjusting the angle of incidence of the seed laser. We show the OPA process to be robust against surface defects of the waveguide and can lead to simple-to-fabricate devices compared to microcavities that take advantage of strong signal-idler correlations in a propagating geometry. Our results closely agree with mean-field numerical simulations.

Title: Exciton-Polariton Dynamics in Multilayered Materials
Authors: Saeed Rahmanian Koshkaki, Arshath Manjalingal, Logan Blackham, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: Coupling excitons with quantized radiation has been shown to enable coherent ballistic transport at room temperature inside optical cavities. Previous theoretical works employ a simple description of the material, depicting it as a single layer placed in the middle of the optical cavity, thereby ignoring the spatial variation of the radiation in the cavity quantization direction. In contrast, in most experiments, the optical cavity is filled with organic molecules or multilayered materials. Here, we develop an efficient mixed-quantum-classical approach, introducing a {\it bright layer} description, to simulate the exciton-polariton quantum dynamics. Our simulations reveal that, for the same Rabi splitting, a multilayer material extends the quantum coherence lifetime and enhances transport compared to a single-layer material. We find that this enhanced coherence can be traced to a synchronization of phonon fluctuations over multiple layers, wherein the collective light-matter coupling in a multilayered material effectively suppresses the phonon-induced dynamical disorder.

Title: Geometric and General Relativistic Techniques for Non-relativistic Quantum Systems
Authors: Aonghus Hunter-McCabe, Brian P. Dolan, Peter Coles
Abstract: This thesis explores the application of differential geometric and general relativistic techniques to deepen our understanding of quantum mechanical systems. We focus on three systems, employing these mathematical frameworks to uncover subtle features within each. First, we examine Unruh radiation in the context of an accelerated two-state atom, determining transition frequencies for a variety of accelerated trajectories via first-order perturbation theory. For harmonic motion of the atom in a vacuum, we derive transition rates with potential experimental realizations. Next, we investigate the quantum Hall effect in a spherical geometry using the Dirac operator for non-interacting fermions in a background magnetic field generated by a Wu-Yang monopole. The Atiyah-Singer index theorem constrains the degeneracy of the ground state, and the fractional quantum Hall effect is studied using the composite fermion model, where Dirac strings associated with the monopole field supply the statistical gauge field vortices. A unique, gapped ground state emerges, yielding fractions of the form $\nu = \frac{1}{2k+1}$ for large particle numbers. Finally, we examine the AdS/CMT correspondence through a bulk fermionic field in an RN-AdS$_4$ background (with a U(1) gauge field), dual to a boundary fermionic operator. Spherical and planar event horizon geometries are discussed, with the temperature of the RN black hole identified with that of the dual system on the boundary. By numerically solving for the spectral functions of the dual theory, for a spherical event horizon at zero temperature, we identify a shift in the Fermi surface from that which arises in the planar case. Preliminary evidence of a phase transition emerges upon examining these spectral functions, again for the spherical horizon, at non-zero temperature.

Title: Agentic Deep Graph Reasoning Yields Self-Organizing Knowledge Networks
Authors: Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: We present an agentic, autonomous graph expansion framework that iteratively structures and refines knowledge in situ. Unlike conventional knowledge graph construction methods relying on static extraction or single-pass learning, our approach couples a reasoning-native large language model with a continually updated graph representation. At each step, the system actively generates new concepts and relationships, merges them into a global graph, and formulates subsequent prompts based on its evolving structure. Through this feedback-driven loop, the model organizes information into a scale-free network characterized by hub formation, stable modularity, and bridging nodes that link disparate knowledge clusters. Over hundreds of iterations, new nodes and edges continue to appear without saturating, while centrality measures and shortest path distributions evolve to yield increasingly distributed connectivity. Our analysis reveals emergent patterns, such as the rise of highly connected 'hub' concepts and the shifting influence of 'bridge' nodes, indicating that agentic, self-reinforcing graph construction can yield open-ended, coherent knowledge structures. Applied to materials design problems, we present compositional reasoning experiments by extracting node-specific and synergy-level principles to foster genuinely novel knowledge synthesis, yielding cross-domain ideas that transcend rote summarization and strengthen the framework's potential for open-ended scientific discovery. We discuss other applications in scientific discovery and outline future directions for enhancing scalability and interpretability.

Title: Confined Electromagnetic Waves in Media Composed of Topological Insulators
Authors: Sebastián Filipini
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) are quantum materials combining insulating bulk properties with conductive surface states protected by time-reversal symmetry. Their unique electromagnetic behavior originates from the topological magnetoelectric effect encoded in an axion-like $\theta$-term ($\theta$ = $\pi$ mod 2$\pi$). This $\theta$-electrodynamics modifies Maxwell's equations specifically at material interfaces through altered boundary conditions, preserving conventional bulk electrodynamics while enabling surface-mediated optical effects like polarization rotation and hybrid wave modes. This thesis explores electromagnetic wave confinement in TI-based waveguides. Key advances include: (1) Controlled modification of reactive and dissipated energies through polarization engineering in waveguide geometries; (2) Experimental realization of transverse electromagnetic (TEM) waves violating Earnshaw's theorem via $\theta$ discontinuities in coaxial TI structures, demonstrating unique polarization rotation mechanisms and low-loss propagation through bent fibers; (3) TEM wave confinement with fewer than two conductors using imaginary $\theta$ parameters, explained through self-consistent surface charge dynamics; (4) First-principles identification of hybrid TE-TM modes in TI slab waveguides, contrasting with conventional magnetoelectric material responses. These findings establish how surface boundary condition modifications from $\theta$ enable new electromagnetic solutions despite unchanged bulk equations. The demonstrated phenomena -- including modified propagation modes, non-trivial polarization dynamics, and unconventional confinement -- suggest photonic applications in polarization control and optical routing. By connecting topological electrodynamics with waveguide physics, this work provides both fundamental insights and practical design principles for topological photonic systems.

Title: Analysis of Josephson Junction Barrier Variation -- a Combined STEM, Breakdown and Monte-Carlo Approach
Authors: Oscar W. Kennedy, Kevin G. Crawford, Kowsar Shahbazi, Connor D. Shelly
Abstract: Josephson junctions manufactured to tight tolerances are necessary components for superconducting quantum computing. Developing precise manufacturing techniques for Josephson junctions requires an understanding of their make-up and robust feedback metrics against which to optimise. Here we consider complementary techniques assessing what conclusions they allow us to draw about the barriers in junctions. Monte-Carlo simulations of barriers show that standard deviations of 15-20 % of the total barrier thickness are compatible with our experimental data. Electrical breakdown allows us to probe the weakest points in barriers. Narrowing the distribution of this breakdown provides a promising feedback mechanism for barrier optimisation. Grouping junctions by breakdown voltage allows us to identify sub-ensembles of junctions with different median resistance, highlighting the importance of weak spots in junction parameters such as resistance. Transmission electron microscopy can be used to find average barrier thickness, although we highlight challenges forming robust conclusions on the distribution of thicknesses in a barrier from these experiments.

Title: Aharonov-Bohm magnetism and Landau diamagnetism in semimetals
Authors: Eugene B. Kolomeisky, Joseph P. Straley
Abstract: We compute the magnetic response of hollow semimetal cylinders and rings to the presence of an axial Aharonov-Bohm magnetic flux, in the absence of interactions. We predict nullification of the Aharonov-Bohm effect for a class of dispersion laws that includes "non-relativistic" dispersion and demonstrate that at zero flux the ground-state of a very short "armchair" graphene tube will exhibit a ferromagnetic broken symmetry. We also compute the diamagnetic response of bulk semimetals to the presence of a uniform magnetic field, specifically predicting that the susceptibility has a logarithmic dependence on the size of the sample.

Title: Hidden Wave Function of Twisted Bilayer Graphene: Flat Band as a Landau Level
Authors: Fedor K. Popov, Alexey Milekhin
Abstract: We study the chirally symmetric continuum model (CS-CM) of the twisted bilayer graphene. The equation on a flat band could be interpreted as a Dirac equation on a torus in the external non-abelian magnetic field. We prove that the existence of the flat band implies that the wave-function has a zero and vice verse. We found a hidden solution in the CS-CM model that has a pole instead of a zero. Our main result is that in the basis of the flat band and hidden wave functions the flat band could be interpreted as Landau level in the external magnetic field. From that interpretation we show the existence of extra flat bands in the magnetic field.

Title: Superlens with copper and copper oxide
Authors: David Ziemkiewicz, Karol Karpiński, Sylwia Zielińska - Raczyńska
Abstract: We investigate the imaging properties of copper-based superlens surrounded by copper oxide (Cu$_2$O). A subwavelength image resolution of the order $\lambda/9$ is demonstrated theoretically and verified in numerical simulations. It is shown that the existence of excitons in Cu$_2$O influence the static and dynamical optical properties of the lens. In particular, an improvement of image quality caused by absorption in the spectral region of excitonic resonances is investigated. The plasmon-exciton interaction in the system may pave the way to a tunable, highly nonlinear superlens designs.

Title: Non-orthogonal eigenvectors, fluctuation-dissipation relations and entropy production
Authors: Yan V. Fyodorov, Ewa Gudowska-Nowak, Maciej A. Nowak, Wojciech Tarnowski
Abstract: Celebrated fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT) linking the response function to time dependent correlations of observables measured in the reference unperturbed state is one of the central results in equilibrium statistical mechanics. In this Letter we discuss an extension of the standard FDT to the case when multidimensional matrix representing transition probabilities is strictly non-normal. This feature dramatically modifies the dynamics, by incorporating the effect of eigenvector nonorthogonality via the associated overlap matrix of Chalker-Mehlig type. In particular, the rate of entropy production per unit time is strongly enhanced by that matrix. We suggest, that this mechanism has an impact on the studies of collective phenomena in neural matrix models, leading, via transient behavior, to such phenomena as synchronization and emergence of the memory. We also expect, that the described mechanism generating the entropy production is generic for wide class of phenomena, where dynamics is driven by non-normal operators. For the case of driving by a large Ginibre matrix the entropy production rate is evaluated analytically, as well as for the Rajan-Abbott model for neural networks.

Authors: Takumi Funato, Shunichiro Kinoshita, Norihiro Tanahashi, Shin Nakamura, Mamoru Matsuo
Abstract: We study nonequilibrium spin dynamics in differentially rotating systems, deriving an effective Hamiltonian for conduction electrons in the comoving frame. In contrast to conventional spin current generation mechanisms that require vorticity, our theory describes spins and spin currents arising from differentially rotating systems regardless of vorticity. We demonstrate the generation of spin currents in differentially rotating systems, such as liquid metals with Taylor-Couette flow. Our alternative mechanism will be important in the development of nanomechanical spin devices.

Title: Unprecedentedly large gap in HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+δ}$ with the highest $T_c$ at ambient pressure
Authors: Chuanhao Wen, Zhiyong Hou, Alireza Akbari, Kailun Chen, Wenshan Hong, Huan Yang, Ilya Eremin, Yuan Li, Hai-Hu Wen
Abstract: In cuprate superconductors, the highest $T_c$ is possessed by the HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg-1223) system at ambient pressure, but the reason remains elusive. Here we report the scanning tunneling measurements on the Hg-1223 single crystals with $T_c$ = 134 K. The observed gaps determined from the tunneling spectra (STS) can be categorized into two groups: the smaller gap $\Delta_1$ ranges from about 45 to 70 meV, while the larger gap $\Delta_2$ from about 65 to 98 meV. The STS was measured up to 200 K and the larger gap can persist well above $T_c$, indicating a pseudogap feature which may reflect the strong pairing energy in the inner layer. Interestingly, an extremely strong particle-hole asymmetry is observed in associating with a very robust coherence-like peak at the bias of the larger gap in the hole branch of the Bogoliubov dispersion. We argue that the observed asymmetry results may be from the interplay of a flat band (van Hove singularity) in the electronic spectrum and the large gap in the underdoped (inner) layer. A theoretical approach based on a trilayer model with an interlayer coupling can give a reasonable explanation. Our results provide deep insight into understanding the mechanism of superconductivity in cuprate superconductors.

Title: Pressure-enhanced spin-density-wave transition in double-layer nickelate $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-δ}$
Authors: Dan Zhao, Yanbing Zhou, Mengwu Huo, Yu Wang, Linpeng Nie, Ye Yang, Jianjun Ying, Meng Wang, Tao Wu, Xianhui Chen
Abstract: Recently, a signature of high-temperature superconductivity above the liquid nitrogen temperature (77 K) was reported for $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$ under pressure. This finding immediately stimulated intense interest in the possible mechanism of high-$T_{c}$ superconductivity in double-layer nickelates. Notably, the pressure-dependent phase diagram inferred from transport measurements indicates that the superconductivity under high pressure emerges from the suppression of density-wave-like order at ambient pressure, which is similar to high-temperature superconductors. Here, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy of $^{139}La$ nuclei was performed to study the density-wave-like transition in a single crystal of $La_{3}Ni_{2}O_{7-\delta}$. At high temperatures, two sets of sharp $^{139}La$ NMR peaks are clearly distinguishable from a broad background signals, which are ascribed to La(1) sites from two bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper phases with different oxygen vacancy ${\delta}$. As the temperature decreases, the temperature-dependent $^{139}La$ NMR spectra and nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $(1/T_{1}$) for both La(1) sites provide evidence of spin-density-wave (SDW) ordering below the transition temperature ($T_{SDW}$), which is ~ 150 K. The anisotropic splitting in the NMR spectra suggests the formation of a possible double spin stripe with magnetic moments aligned along the c-axis. Furthermore, we studied the pressure-dependent SDW transition up to ~ 2.7 GPa. Surprisingly, the $T_{SDW}$ inferred from NMR measurements of both La(1) sites increases with increasing pressure, which is opposite to the results from previous transport measurements under pressure and suggests an intriguing phase diagram between superconductivity and SDW. All these results will be helpful for building a connection between superconductivity and magnetic interactions in double-layer nickelates.

Title: Light-driven interlayer propagation of collective-mode excitations in layered superconductors
Authors: Niklas Ziereis, Kazuaki Takasan, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit a nonlinear interaction with an applied light, which can resonantly excite the collective amplitude (Higgs) mode. Here we study light-induced dynamics of layered superconductors, where each layer is coupled to adjacent layers via the Josephson coupling and the first few layers near the surface are driven by an in-plane-polarized light. We study the system under the assumption that the interlayer Coulomb interactions are sufficiently screened out and that the phase-difference mode becomes available in the low-energy regime. We find that interlayer transport is induced via excitations of the collective amplitude and phase-difference modes, even when the applied electric field is parallel to the planes. We provide analytic calculations as well as numerical simulations of the real-time dynamics, and investigate the influence on the light-induced interlayer Josephson current and intralayer third-harmonic generation.

Title: Boosting Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo with Submatrix Updates: Unveiling the Phase Diagram of the 3D Hubbard Model
Authors: Fanjie Sun, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Determinant Quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) provides numerically exact solutions for strongly correlated fermionic systems but faces significant computational challenges with increasing system size. While submatrix updates were originally developed for Hirsch-Fye QMC with onsite interactions at finite temperatures [Phys. Rev. B 80, 195111 (2009)], their comprehensive application in DQMC has remained unexplored despite noted algorithmic similarities. We present the first comprehensive application of submatrix updates in DQMC, significantly extending beyond the original scope by enabling simulations with extended interactions and at zero temperature. Building upon conventional fast updates and delay updates, our generalized implementation achieves an order-of-magnitude improvement in computational efficiency, enabling simulations of the half-filled Hubbard model on lattices up to 8,000 sites - a scale previously challenging with standard DQMC implementations. This enhanced computational capability allows us to accurately determine the finite-temperature phase diagram of the 3D Hubbard model at half-filling. Our findings not only shed light on the phase transitions within these complex systems but also pave the way for more effective simulations of strongly correlated electrons, potentially guiding experimental efforts in cold atom simulations of the 3D Hubbard model.

Title: Anatomy of Higher-Order Non-Hermitian Skin and Boundary Modes
Authors: Fan Yang, Emil J. Bergholtz
Abstract: The anomalous bulk-boundary correspondence in non-Hermitian systems featuring an intricate interplay between skin and boundary modes has attracted enormous theoretical and experimental attention. Still, in dimensions higher than one, this interplay remains much less understood. Here we provide insights from exact analytical solutions of a large class of models in any dimension, $d$, with open boundaries in $d_c \le d$ directions and by tracking their topological origin. Specifically, we show that Amoeba theory accounting for the separation gaps of the bulk modes augmented with higher-dimensional generalizations of the biorthogonal polarization and the generalized Brillouin zone approaches accounting for the surface gaps of boundary modes provide a comprehensive understanding of these systems.

Title: Theory of Correlated Insulators and Superconductor at $ν=1$ in Twisted WSe$_2$
Authors: Sunghoon Kim, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Xuepeng Wang, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: The observation of a superconducting phase, an intertwined insulating phase, and a continuous transition between the two at a commensurate filling of $\nu=1$ in bilayers of twisted WSe$_2$ at $\theta=3.65^0$ raises a number of intriguing questions about the origin of this phenomenology. Here we report the possibility of a displacement-field induced continuous transition between a superconductor and a quantum spin-liquid Mott insulator at $\nu=1$, starting with a simplified three-orbital model of twisted WSe$_2$, including on-site, nearest-neighbor density-density interactions, and a chiral-exchange interaction, respectively. By employing parton mean-field theory, we discuss the nature of these correlated insulators, their expected evolution with the displacement-field, and their phenomenological properties.

Title: Time-resolved ARPES and optical transport properties of irradiated twisted bilayer graphene in steady-state
Authors: Ashutosh Dubey, Ritajit Kundu, Arijit Kundu
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the trARPES spectrum and optical Hall conductivity in periodically driven twisted bilayer graphene, considering both steady-state and "projected" occupations of the Floquet state. In periodically driven pre-thermalized systems, steady-state occupation of Floquet states is predicted to occur when coupled to a bath, while these states have projected occupation instantaneously after the driving starts. We study how these two regimes can give markedly different responses in optical transport properties. In particular, our results show that steady-state occupation leads to near-quantized optical Hall conductivity for a range of driving parameters in twisted bilayer graphene, whereas projected occupation leads to non-quantized values. We discuss the experimental feasibility of probing such non-equilibrium states in twisted bilayer graphene.

Title: The hybrid Josephson rhombus: A superconducting element with tailored current-phase relation
Authors: L. Banszerus, C. W. Andersson, W. Marshall, T. Lindemann, M. J. Manfra, C. M. Marcus, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: Controlling the current-phase relation (CPR) of Josephson elements is essential for tailoring the eigenstates of superconducting qubits, tuning the properties of parametric amplifiers, and designing nonreciprocal superconducting devices. Here, we introduce the hybrid Josephson rhombus, a highly tunable superconducting circuit containing four semiconductor-superconductor hybrid Josephson junctions embedded in a loop. Combining magnetic frustration with gate-voltage-controlled tuning of individual Josephson couplings provides deterministic control of the harmonic content of the rhombus CPR. We show that for balanced Josephson couplings at full frustration, the hybrid rhombus displays a $\pi$-periodic $\cos(2\varphi)$ potential, indicating coherent charge-$4e$ transport. Tuning away from the balanced configuration, we observe a superconducting diode effect with efficiency exceeding 25%. These results showcase the potential of hybrid Josephson rhombi as fundamental building blocks for noise-resilient qubits and quantum devices with custom transport properties.

Title: Valley polarization of Landau levels driven by residual strain in the ZrSiS surface band
Authors: Christopher J. Butler, Masayuki Murase, Shunki Sawada, Ming-Chun Jiang, Daisuke Hashizume, Guang-Yu Guo, Ryotaro Arita, Tetsuo Hanaguri, Takao Sasagawa
Abstract: In a multi-valley electronic band structure, lifting of the valley degeneracy is associated with rotational symmetry breaking in the electronic fluid, and may emerge through spontaneous symmetry breaking order, or through a large response to a small external perturbation such as strain. In this work we use scanning tunneling microscopy to investigate an unexpected rotational symmetry breaking in Landau levels formed in the unusual floating surface band of ZrSiS. We visualize a ubiquitous splitting of Landau levels into valley-polarized sub-levels. We demonstrate methods to measure valley-selective Landau level spectroscopy, to infer unknown Landau level indices, and to precisely measure each valley's Berry phase in a way that is agnostic to the band structure and topology of the system. These techniques allow us to obtain each valley's dispersion curve and infer a rigid valley-dependent contribution to the band energies. Ruling out spontaneous symmetry breaking by establishing the sample-dependence of this valley splitting, we explain the effect in terms of residual strain. A quantitative estimate indicates that uniaxial strain can be measured to a precision of $ \lt 0.025 \% $. The extreme valley-polarization of the Landau levels results from as little as $ \sim 0.1 \% $ strain, and this suggests avenues for manipulation using deliberate strain engineering.

Title: DanceQ: High-performance library for number-conserving bases
Authors: Robin Schäfer, David J. Luitz
Abstract: The complexity of quantum many-body problems scales exponentially with the size of the system, rendering any finite size scaling analysis a formidable challenge. This is particularly true for methods based on the full representation of the wave function, where one simply accepts the enormous Hilbert space dimensions and performs linear algebra operations, e.g., for finding the ground state of the Hamiltonian. If the system satisfies an underlying symmetry where an operator with degenerate spectrum commutes with the Hamiltonian, it can be block-diagonalized, thus reducing the complexity at the expense of additional bookkeeping. At the most basic level, required for Krylov space techniques (like the Lanczos algorithm) it is necessary to implement a matrix-vector product of a block of the Hamiltonian with arbitrary block-wavefunctions, potentially without holding the Hamiltonian block in memory. An efficient implementation of this operation requires the calculation of the position of an arbitrary basis vector in the canonical ordering of the basis of the block. We present here an elegant and powerful, multi-dimensional approach to this problem for the $U(1)$ symmetry appearing in problems with particle number conservation. Our divide-and-conquer algorithm uses multiple subsystems and hence generalizes previous approaches to make them scalable. In addition to the theoretical presentation of our algorithm, we provide DanceQ, a flexible and modern - header only - C++20 implementation to manipulate, enumerate, and map to its index any basis state in a given particle number sector as open source software under this https URL.

Title: Covariance Linkage Assimilation method for Unobserved Data Exploration
Authors: Yosuke Harashima, Takashi Miyake, Ryuto Baba, Tomoaki Takayama, Shogo Takasuka, Yasuteru Shigeta, Yuichi Yamaguchi, Akihiko Kudo, Mikiya Fujii
Abstract: This study proposes a materials search method combining a data assimilation technique based on a multivariate Gaussian distribution with Bayesian optimization. The efficiency of the search using this method was demonstrated using a pair of example functions. By combining Bayesian optimization with the data assimilation technique, the maximum value of the example function was found more efficiently compared to ordinary Bayesian optimization without the data assimilation. A practical demonstration was also conducted by constructing a data assimilation model for the bandgap of (Sr$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$La$_{x_{1}}$Na$_{x_{2}}$)(Ti$_{1-x_{1}-x_{2}}$Ga$_{x_{1}}$Ta$_{x_{2}}$)O$_{3}$. The concentration dependence of the bandgap was analyzed, and synthesis was performed with chemical compositions in the sparse region of the training data points to validate the predictions.

Title: Multi-orbital two-particle self-consistent approach -- strengths and limitations
Authors: Jonas B. Profe, Jiawei Yan, Karim Zantout, Philipp Werner, Roser Valentí
Abstract: Extending many-body numerical techniques which are powerful in the context of simple model calculations to the realm of realistic material simulations can be a challenging task. Realistic systems often involve multiple active orbitals, which increases the complexity and numerical cost because of the large local Hilbert space and the large number of interaction terms or sign-changing off-diagonal Green's functions. The two-particle self-consistent approach (TPSC) is one such many-body numerical technique, for which multi-orbital extensions have proven to be involved due to the substantially more complex structure of the local interaction tensor. In this paper we extend earlier multi-orbital generalizations of TPSC by setting up two different variants of a fully self-consistent theory for TPSC in multi-orbital systems. We first investigate the strengths and limitations of the approach analytically and then benchmark both variants against dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) and D-TRILEX results. We find that the exact behavior of the system can be faithfully reproduced in the weak-coupling regime, while at stronger couplings the performance of the two TPSC variants strongly depends on details of the system.

Title: Non-Hermitian ultra-strong bosonic clustering through interaction-induced caging
Authors: Mengjie Yang, Luqi Yuan, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: We uncover a new mechanism whereby the triple interplay of non-Hermitian pumping, bosonic interactions and nontrivial band topology leads to ultra-strong bosonic condensation. The extent of condensation goes beyond what is naively expected from the interaction-induced trapping of non-Hermitian pumped states, and is based on an emergent caging mechanism that can be further enhanced by topological boundary modes. Beyond our minimal model with 2 bosons, this caging remains applicable for generic many-boson systems subject to a broad range of density interactions and non-Hermitian hopping asymmetry. Our novel new mechanism for particle localization and condensation would inspire fundamental shifts in our comprehension of many-body non-Hermitian dynamics and opens new avenues for controlling and manipulating bosons.

Title: Nonlinearity of transparent SNS weak links decreases sharply with length
Authors: Valla Fatemi, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Anton R. Akhmerov, Bernard van Heck
Abstract: Superconductor-normal material-superconductor (SNS) junctions are being integrated into microwave circuits for fundamental and applied research goals. The short junction limit is a common simplifying assumption for experiments with SNS junctions, but this limit constrains how small the nonlinearity of the microwave circuit can be. Here, we show that a finite length of the weak link strongly suppresses the nonlinearity compared to its zero-length limit -- the suppression can be up to a factor of ten even when the length remains shorter than the induced coherence length. We tie this behavior to the nonanalytic dependence of nonlinearity on length, which the critical current does not exhibit. Further, we identify additional experimentally observable consequences of nonzero length, and we conjecture that anharmonicity is bounded between zero and a maximally negative value for any non-interacting Josephson junction in the presence of time-reversal symmetry. We promote SNS junction length as a useful parameter for designing weakly nonlinear microwave circuits.

Title: Active noise-induced dynamic clustering of passive colloids
Authors: Layne B. Frechette, Aparna Baskaran, Michael F. Hagan
Abstract: Active fluids generate spontaneous, often chaotic mesoscale flows. Harnessing these flows to drive embedded soft materials into structures with controlled length scales and lifetimes is a key challenge at the interface between the fields of active matter and nonequilibrium self-assembly. Here, we present a simple and efficient computational approach to model soft materials advected by active fluids, by simulating particles moving in a spatiotemporally correlated noise field. To illustrate our approach, we simulate the dynamical self-organization of repulsive colloids within such an active noise field in two and three dimensions. The colloids form structures whose sizes and dynamics can be tuned by the correlation time and length of the active fluid, and range from small rotating droplets to clusters with internal flows and system-spanning sizes that vastly exceed the active correlation length. Our results elucidate how the interplay between active fluid time/length scales and emergent driven assembly can be used to rationally design functional assemblies. More broadly, our approach can be used to efficiently simulate diverse active fluids and other systems with spatiotemporally correlated noise.

Title: Spin-dependent localization of spin-orbit and Rabi-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in a random potential
Authors: Swarup K. Sarkar, Sh. Mardonov, E. Ya. Sherman, Paulsamy Muruganandam, Pankaj K. Mishra
Abstract: We investigate the effect of the spin-orbit (SO) and Rabi couplings on the localization of the spin-1/2 condensate trapped in a one-dimensional random potential. Our studies reveal that the spin-dependent couplings create distinct localization regimes, resulting in various relations between localization and spin-related properties. First, we examine the localization in the linear condensate and find that the SO coupling can lead to a transition of the localized state from the "basin-like" to the "void" region of the potential. For a weak random potential upon an increase in the SO coupling, we find a re-entrant transition from a broad to narrow localized state and back at a higher SO coupling. Further, we analyze the competing role of inter-species and intra-species interactions on the localization of the condensate. We find the appearance of spin-dependent localization as the interactions increase beyond threshold values for a sufficiently strong disorder. Our findings on controlling spin-dependent localization may be useful for future ultracold atomic experiments and corresponding spin-related quantum technologies.

Title: Role of non-magnetic spacers in the magnetic interactions of antiferromagnetic topological insulators MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ and MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$
Authors: Bing Li, D. M. Pajerowski, J.-Q. Yan, R. J. McQueeney
Abstract: MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ belongs to a family of antiferromagnetic topological insulators. It forms a natural heterostructure of magnetic (septuple) and non-magnetic (quintuple) topological blocks. Here, we explore the magnetism and magnetic interactions in this compound using inelastic neutron scattering. We find that the interlayer magnetic coupling is much weaker in MnBi$_{4}$Te$_{7}$ as compared to MnBi$_{2}$Te$_{4}$ due to the insertion of non-magnetic quintuple layers in the former. However, other key magnetic energy scales residing within a single septuple block, the single-ion anisotropy and long-range intralayer exchanges, are essentially the same. This identifies a transferable set of magnetic interactions applicable to the extended family of magnetic topological insulators based on MnBi$_2$Te$_4$-Bi$_2$Te$_3$ heterostructures.

Title: Arrested development and traveling waves of active suspensions in nematic liquid crystals
Authors: Jingyi Li, Laurel Ohm, Saverio E. Spagnolie
Abstract: Active particles in anisotropic, viscoelastic fluids experience competing stresses which guide their trajectories. An aligned suspension of particles can trigger a hydrodynamic bend instability, but the elasticity of the fluid can drive particle orientations back towards alignment. To study these competing effects, we examine a dilute suspension of active particles in an Ericksen-Leslie model nematic liquid crystal. An anchoring strength linking the active and passive media tunes the system between active suspension theory in Newtonian fluids in one limit, and active nematic theory in another. For small active Ericksen number or particle concentration the suspension settles to an equilibrium state with uniform alignment. Beyond a critical active Ericksen number or particle concentration, the suspension instead can buckle into a steady flowing state. Rather than entering the fully developed roiling state observed in isotropic fluids, the development is arrested by fluid elasticity. Arrested states of higher wavenumber emerge at yet higher values of active Ericksen number, and a phase transition is identified at finite anchoring strength. If the active particles are motile, traveling waves emerge, including a traveling, oscillatory `thrashing' mode. Moment equations are derived, compared to kinetic theory simulations, and analyzed in asymptotic limits which admit exact expressions for the traveling wave speed and both particle orientation and director fields in the arrested state.

Title: Dynamical probing of high-order spin coherence in one-dimensional mixtures
Authors: Silvia Musolino, Gianni Aupetit-Diallo, Mathias Albert, Patrizia Vignolo, Anna Minguzzi
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional SU(2) ultracold fermions near the Tonks-Girardeau limit, confined in a box potential. The system is driven out of equilibrium by initially preparing the two spin components in a fully separated configuration, and its evolution is described by the Hamiltonian in the presence of strong repulsive interactions. Building on the results in [arXiv:2302.02828, Phys$.$Rev. A, 107, L061301 (2023)], we extend the analysis to out-of-equilibrium dynamics, uncovering the emergence of time-dependent oscillating high-momentum tails in the momentum distribution. These oscillations, due to the finite size of the system, are governed by a nonlocal, high-order spin coherence term, whose amplitude and phase evolve over time. We show that this term initially grows as time to the power N/2 and subsequently follows the spin-mixing dynamics of the system. Notably, when the spin components are fully mixed, the amplitude of this border-to-border spin coherence reaches its maximum value.

Title: Spin-stripe order tied to the pseudogap phase in La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4
Authors: A. Missiaen, H. Mayaffre, S. Krämer, D. Zhao, Y.B. Zhou, T. Wu, X.H. Chen, S. Pyon, T. Takayama, H. Takagi, D. LeBoeuf, M.-H. Julien
Abstract: Although spin and charge stripes in high-Tc cuprates have been extensively studied, the exact range of carrier concentration over which they form a static order remains uncertain, complicating efforts to understand their significance. In La2-xSrxCuO4 (LSCO) and in zero external magnetic field, static spin stripes are confined to a doping range well below p*, the pseudogap boundary at zero temperature. However, when high fields suppress the competing effect of superconductivity, spin stripe order is found to extend up to p*. Here, we investigated La1.8-xEu0.2SrxCuO4 (Eu-LSCO) using 139La nuclear magnetic resonance and observe field-dependent spin fluctuations suggesting a similar competition between superconductivity and spin order as in LSCO. Nevertheless, we find that static spin stripes are present practically up to p* irrespective of field strength: the stronger stripe order in Eu-LSCO prevents superconductivity from enforcing a non-magnetic ground state, except very close to p*. Thus, spin-stripe order is consistently bounded by p* in both LSCO and Eu-LSCO, despite their differing balances between stripe order and superconductivity. This indicates that the canonical stripe order, where spins and charges are intertwined in a static pattern, is fundamentally tied to the pseudogap phase, though the exact nature of this connection has yet to be elucidated. Any stripe order beyond the pseudogap endpoint must then be of a different nature: either spin and charge orders remain intertwined, but both fluctuating, or only spin order fluctuates while charge order remains static. The presence of spin-stripe order up to p*, the pervasive, slow, and field-dependent spin-stripe fluctuations, as well as the electronic inhomogeneity documented in this work, must all be carefully considered in discussions of Fermi surface transformations, quantum criticality, and strange metal behavior.

Title: Magnetic order induced chiral phonons in a ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal
Authors: Mengqian Che, Jinxuan Liang, Yunpeng Cui, Hao Li, Bingru Lu, Wenbo Sang, Xiang Li, Xuebin Dong, Le Zhao, Shuai Zhang, Tao Sun, Wanjun Jiang, Enke Liu, Feng Jin, Tiantian Zhang, Luyi Yang
Abstract: Chiral phonons are vibrational modes in a crystal that possess a well-defined handedness or chirality, typically found in materials that lack inversion symmetry. Here we report the discovery of chiral phonon modes in the kagome ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal Co3Sn2S2, a material that preserves inversion symmetry but breaks time-reversal symmetry. Using helicity-resolved magneto-Raman spectroscopy, we observe the spontaneous splitting of the doubly degenerate in-plane Eg modes into two distinct chiral phonon modes of opposite helicity when the sample is zero-field cooled below the Curie temperature, in the absence of an external magnetic field. As we sweep the out-of-plane magnetic field, this Eg phonon splitting exhibits a well-defined hysteresis loop directly correlated with the material's magnetization. The observed spontaneous splitting reaches up to 1.27 cm-1 at low temperatures, progressively diminishes with increasing temperature, and completely vanishes near the Curie temperature. Our findings highlight the role of the magnetic order in inducing chiral phonons, paving the way for novel methods to manipulate chiral phonons through magnetization and vice versa. Additionally, our work introduces new possibilities for controlling chiral Weyl fermions using chiral phonons.

Title: Investigation of the doping effects of Sr-Ta on the Ionic Conductivity of Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte
Authors: Muktai Aote, A. V. Deshpande, Kajal Parchake, Anuj Khapekar
Abstract: A solid electrolyte having the ionic conductivity comparable to that of conventional liquid electrolyte can be used in All Solid State Batteries (ASSB's). The series Li6.75+xLa3-xSrxZr1.75Ta0.25O12 (x = 0 to 0.20) was synthesized to improve the ionic conductivity of garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 (LLZO). The structural, physical and morphological investigations have been carried out for all the synthesized samples using X ray diffraction, density measurement and scanning electron microscopy respectively. The results of electrochemical analysis showed that the maximum room temperature ionic conductivity of 3.5 x 10-4 S/cm and minimum activation energy of 0.29 eV is achieved by the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample sintered at 1050^oC. The DC conductivity measurement confirmed the dominance of ionic conduction in the prepared ceramic samples. The highest ionic conductivity with the minimum activation energy makes the 0.05 Sr ceramic sample a suitable choice as solid electrolyte for All Solid State Lithium Ion Batteries (ASSLIB's).

Title: Single-cone Dirac edge states on a lattice
Authors: Alvaro Donís Vela, Carlo W. J. Beenakker
Abstract: The stationary Dirac equation $(p\cdot\sigma)\psi=E\psi$, confined to a two-dimensional (2D) region, supports states propagating along the boundary and decaying exponentially away from the boundary. These edge states appear on the 2D surface of a 3D topological insulator, where massless fermionic quasiparticles are governed by the Dirac equation and confined by a magnetic insulator. We show how the continuous system can be simulated on a 2D square lattice, without running into the fermion-doubling obstruction. For that purpose we adapt the existing tangent fermion discretization on an unbounded lattice to account for a lattice termination that simulates the magnetic insulator interface.

Title: Analysis of axisymmetric necking of a circular dielectric membrane based on a one-dimensional model
Authors: Xiang Yu, Yibin Fu
Abstract: To facilitate the understanding of the mechanisms underlying the electric breakdown of dielectric elastomers, we derive a one-dimensional (1d) model for axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane subjected to equibiaxial stretching and an electric field, starting from the three-dimensional (3d) nonlinear electroelasticity theory. Our reduction is built on the variational asymptotic method, so that the resulting 1d model is asymptotically self-consistent. The 1d model offers an easier and more efficient way to analyze axisymmetric necking in a dielectric membrane in the linear, weakly nonlinear and fully nonlinear regimes. It delivers results identical to the 3d theory in the linear and weakly nonlinear regimes, and near-identical results in the fully nonlinear regime due to its asymptotic self-consistency. We demonstrate the straightforward implementation of this 1d model by solving it using the Rayleigh--Ritz method and validate it by comparison with finite-element simulations. The 1d model enables a precise calculation of the minimum thickness that a dielectric membrane can reach when necking instability occurs and quantitative assessment of the effects of imperfections so that the integrity of a dielectric elastomer actuator can be evaluated with respect to electric breakdown. The developed methodology is not problem-specific and can also be applied to analyze similar phenomena in other soft materials subjected to any fields (e.g., the axisymmetric necking of stretched plastic membranes).

Title: Transport Signatures of Radial Rashba Spin-Orbit Coupling at Ferromagnet/Superconductor Interfaces
Authors: Andreas Costa, Jaroslav Fabian
Abstract: Spin-orbit coupling (SOC) emerging at the interfaces of superconducting magnetic tunnel junctions is at the heart of multiple unprecedented physical phenomena, covering triplet proximity effects induced by unconventional (spin-flip) Andreev reflections, giant transport magnetoanisotropies, sizable tunneling anomalous Hall effects, and electrically controlled current-reversing $ 0 $--$ \pi $(-like) transitions in Josephson contacts. Recent first-principles calculations proposed that the Rashba spin-orbit fields in twisted graphene/transition-metal dichalcogenide and van der Waals multilayers can -- owing to broken mirror symmetries -- exhibit an unconventional radial component (with spin parallel to the electron's momentum), which can be quantified by the Rashba angle $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $. We theoretically explore the ramifications of radial Rashba SOC at the interfaces of vertical ferromagnet/superconductor tunnel junctions with a focus on the magnetoanisotropies of the tunneling and tunneling-anomalous-Hall-effect conductances. Our results demonstrate that $ \theta_\mathrm{R} $ can be experimentally extracted from respective magnetization-angle shifts, providing a robust way to probe the radial Rashba SOC induced by twisted multilayers that are placed as tunneling barriers between ferromagnetic and superconducting electrodes.

Abstract: Introducing superconductivity into group IV elements by doping has long promised a pathway to introduce quantum functionalities into well-established semiconductor technologies. The non-equilibrium hyperdoping of group III atoms into Si or Ge has successfully shown superconductivity can be achieved, however, the origin of superconductivity has been obscured by structural disorder and dopant clustering. Here, we report the epitaxial growth of hyperdoped Ga:Ge films by molecular beam epitaxy with extreme hole concentrations ($n_\textup{h} = 4.15 \times 10^{21}$~cm$^{-3}$, ~17.9\% Ga substitution) that yield superconductivity with a critical temperature of $T_{\textup{c}} = 3.5$~K and an out-of-plane critical field of 1~T at 270~mK. Synchrotron-based X-ray absorption and scattering methods reveal that Ga dopants are substitutionally incorporated within the Ge lattice, introducing a tetragonal distortion to the crystal unit cell. Our findings, corroborated by first-principles calculations, suggest that the structural order of Ga dopants creates a narrow band for the emergence of superconductivity in Ge, establishing hyperdoped Ga:Ge as a low-disorder, epitaxial superconductor-semiconductor platform.

Title: Universal Turbulent States of Miscible Two-Component Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Issei Doki, Makoto Tsubota
Abstract: We investigate turbulence in miscible two-component Bose-Einstein condensates confined in a box potential using the coupled Gross-Pitaevskii equations. Turbulence is driven by an oscillating force, causing the components to oscillate either in-phase (co-oscillating) or out-of-phase (counter-oscillating). A parameter measuring component separation (0 for overlap, 1 for full separation) reveals two turbulent states: coupled (the parameter $\sim0$) and decoupled (the parameter $\sim0.5$). Co-oscillating flows transition between these states at a critical interaction strength, while counter-oscillating flows consistently show the decoupled state. A probabilistic model predicts the decoupled state's parameter as $\sqrt{4/\pi - 1} = 0.523$, consistent with simulations.

Title: Non-Gaussian density fluctuations in the Dean-Kawasaki equation
Authors: Pierre Illien, Antoine Carof
Abstract: Computing analytically the $n$-point density correlations in systems of interacting particles is a long-standing problem of statistical physics, with a broad range of applications, from the interpretation of scattering experiments in simple liquids, to the understanding of their collective dynamics. For Brownian particles, i.e. with overdamped Langevin dynamics, the microscopic density obeys a stochastic evolution equation, known as the Dean-Kawasaki equation. In spite of the importance of this equation, its complexity makes it very difficult to analyze the statistics of the microscopic density beyond simple Gaussian approximations. In this work, resorting to a path-integral description of the stochastic dynamics and relying on the formalism of macroscopic fluctuation theory, we go beyond the usual linearization of the Dean-Kawasaki equation, and we compute perturbatively the three-point density correlation functions, in the limit of high-density and weak interactions between the particles. This exact result opens the way to using the Dean-Kawasaki beyond the simple Gaussian treatments, and could find applications to understand many fluctuation-related effects in soft and active matter systems.

Title: Singularity and universality from von Neumann to Rényi entanglement entropy and disorder operator in Motzkin chains
Authors: Jianyu Wang, Zenan Liu, Zheng Yan, Congjun Wu
Abstract: The Rényi entanglement entropy is widely used in studying quantum entanglement properties in strongly correlated systems, whose analytic continuation as the Rényi index $n \to 1$ is often believed to yield the von Neumann entanglement entropy. However, earlier findings indicate that this process exhibits a singularity for the colored Motzkin spin chain problem, leading to different scaling behaviors of $\sim \sqrt{l}$ and $\sim \log{l}$ for the von Neumann and Rényi entropies, respectively. Our analytical and numerical calculations confirm this transition, which can be explained by the exponentially increasing density of states in the entanglement spectrum that we extract numerically. Disorder operators are further employed under various symmetries to study such a system. Both analytical and numerical results demonstrate that the scaling of the disorder operators also follows $\log{l}$ as the leading behavior, matching that of the Rényi entropy. We propose that the coefficient of the term $\log{l}$ is a universal constant shared by both the Rényi entropies and disorder operators. This universal constant could potentially help capture the underlying constraint physics of Motzkin walks.

Title: Improving noisy free-energy measurements by adding more noise
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: Estimating free-energy differences using nonequilibrium work relations, such as the Jarzynski equality, is hindered by poor convergence when work fluctuations are large. For systems governed by overdamped Langevin dynamics, we propose the counterintuitive approach of adding noise in order to increase the precision of such calculations. By introducing additional stochastic fluctuations to the system and rescaling its potential energy, we leave the thermodynamics of the system unchanged while increasing its relaxation rate. For a given time-dependent protocol this modification reduces dissipated work, leading to more accurate free-energy estimates. We demonstrate this principle using computer simulations applied to two model systems. However, the regime of applicability of this strategy is likely limited, because it requires control of the system's potential energy in a way that is feasible in only a few experimental settings.

Title: Self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion
Authors: Bohan Lyu, Jie Lin
Abstract: The droplet size distribution typically decays exponentially in solutions formed by liquid-liquid phase separation. Nevertheless, a power-law distribution of nucleoli volumes has been observed in amphibian oocytes, which appears similar to the cluster size distribution in reaction-limited aggregation. In this work, we study the mechanism of power-law distributed droplet sizes and unveil a self-organized criticality driven by droplet influx and random fusion between droplets. Surprisingly, the droplet size dynamics is governed by a similar Smoluchowski equation as the cluster size in aggregation systems. The system reaches a critical state as the area fraction approaches the critical value at which the droplet size has a power-law distribution with a $1.5$ exponent. Furthermore, the system is also spatially scale-free with a divergent correlation length at the critical state, marked by giant droplet-density fluctuations and power-law decay of the pair correlation function.

Title: Phase space contraction rate for classical mixed states
Authors: Mohamed Sahbani, Swetamber Das, Jason R. Green
Abstract: Physical systems with non-reciprocal or dissipative forces evolve according to a generalization of Liouville's equation that accounts for the expansion and contraction of phase space volume. Here, we connect geometric descriptions of these non-Hamiltonian dynamics to a recently established classical density matrix theory. In this theory, the evolution of a "maximally mixed" classical density matrix is related to the well-known phase space contraction rate that, when ensemble averaged, is the rate of entropy exchange with the surroundings. Here, we extend the definition of mixed states to include statistical and mechanical components, describing both the deformations of local phase space regions and the evolution of ensembles within them. As a result, the equation of motion for this mixed state represents the rate of contraction for an ensemble of dissipative trajectories. Recognizing this density matrix as a covariance matrix, its contraction rate is another measure of entropy flow characterizing nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Frustration-driven topological textures on the honeycomb lattice: antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron and skyrmion crystals emerging from spiral spin liquids
Authors: M. Mohylna, F. A. Gómez Albarracín, M. Žukovič, H. Diego Rosales
Abstract: Skyrmions -- topologically nontrivial magnetic quasi-particles -- can emerge in two-dimensional chiral magnets due to moderate or high strength of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction. In this work, we show that the inclusion of weak next-nearest-neighbor DM interaction in the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ honeycomb-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet leads to the emergence of field-induced incommensurate antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pairs and antiferromagnetic skyrmion structures. Using the Luttinger-Tisza approximation and large-scale Monte Carlo simulations, we report that for lower frustration values, antiferromagnetic meron-antimeron pair crystal and gas phases emerge within a small magnetic field window. In these meron phases, the fundamental unit consists of a meron-antimeron pair residing on different sublattices of the honeycomb lattice, even in the gas phase, where they exhibit greater mobility. For larger frustration, a two-layer-like three-sublattice antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystal phase is stabilized over a wider magnetic field range. At lower temperatures, this region splits into two distinct antiferromagnetic skyrmion phases with skyrmions of different sizes, reflecting the influence of frustration and thermal effects on the stabilization of these topological textures. Interestingly, both meron and skyrmion low-temperature phases connect to spiral spin liquid phases of the honeycomb lattice at higher temperatures. Additionally, we analyze the emergent single-$q$ and double-$q$ phases at low temperatures, constructing a comprehensive phase diagram.

Title: Multiscale nanoindentation modeling of concentrated solid solutions: A continuum plasticity model
Authors: K. Frydrych, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, M. J. Alava, S. Papanikolaou
Abstract: Recently developed single-phase concentrated solid-solution alloys (CSAs) contain multiple elemental species in high concentrations with different elements randomly arranged on a crystalline lattice. These chemically disordered materials present excellent physical properties, including high-temperature thermal stability and hardness, with promising applications to industries at extreme operating environments. The aim of this paper is to present a continuum plasticity model accounting for the first time for the behaviour of a equiatomic five-element CSA, that forms a face-centered cubic lattice. The inherent disorder associated with the lattice distortions caused by an almost equiatomic distribution of atoms, is captured by a single parameter {\alpha} that quantifies the relative importance of an isotropic plastic contribution to the model. This results in multiple plasticity mechanisms that go beyond crystallographic symmetry-based ones, common in the case of conventional single element metals. We perform molecular dynamics simulations of equiatomic CSAs: NiFe, NiFeCr, NiFeCrCo, and Cantor alloys to validate the proposed continuum model which is implemented in the finite element method and applied to model nanoindentation tests for three different crystallographic orientations. We obtain the representative volume element model by tracking the combined model yield surface.

Title: Correlation between upstreamness and downstreamness in random global value chains
Authors: Silvia Bartolucci, Fabio Caccioli, Francesco Caravelli, Pierpaolo Vivo
Abstract: This paper is concerned with upstreamness and downstreamness of industries and countries. Upstreamness and downstreamness measure respectively the average distance of an industrial sector from final consumption and from primary inputs. Recently, Antràs and Chor reported a puzzling and counter-intuitive finding in data from the period 1995-2011, namely that (at country level) upstreamness appears to be positively correlated with downstreamness, with a correlation slope close to $+1$. We first analyze a simple model of random Input/Output tables, and we show that, under minimal and realistic structural assumptions, there is a natural positive correlation emerging between upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country, with correlation slope equal to $+1$. This effect is robust against changes in the randomness of the entries of the I/O table and different aggregation protocols. Secondly, we perform experiments by randomly reshuffling the entries of the empirical I/O table where these puzzling correlations are detected, in such a way that the global structural constraints are preserved. Again, we find that the upstreamness and downstreamness of the same industrial sector/country are positively correlated with slope close to $+1$. Our results strongly suggest that (i) extra care is needed when interpreting these measures as simple representations of each sector's positioning along the value chain, as the ``curse of the input-output identities'' and labor effects effectively force the value chain to acquire additional links from primary factors of production, and (ii) the empirically observed puzzling correlation may rather be a necessary consequence of the few structural constraints (positive entries, and sub-stochasticity) that Input/Output tables and their surrogates must meet.

Title: CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ Adsorption Mechanisms on Monolayer Graphenylene and their Effects on Optical and Electronic Properties
Authors: A. Aligayev, F. J. Dominguez-Gutierrez, M. Chourashiya, S. Papanikolaou, Q. Huang
Abstract: In this study, we employ a computational chemistry-based modeling approach to investigate the adsorption mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on monolayer GPNL, with a specific focus on their effects on optical adsorption and electrical transport properties at room temperature. To simulate the adsorption dynamics as closely as possible to experimental conditions, we utilize the self-consistent charge tight-binding density functional theory (SCC-DFTB). Through semi-classical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, we observe the formation of H$_2$ molecules from the dissociation of CH$_4$ and the formation of CO+O species from carbon dioxide molecules. This provides insights into the adsorption and dispersion mechanisms of CH$_4$ and CO$_2$ on GPNL. Furthermore, we explore the impact of molecular adsorption on optical absorption properties. Our results demonstrate that CH$_4$ and CH$_2$ affects drastically the optical adsorption of GPNL, while CO$_2$ does not significantly affect the optical properties of the two-dimensional material. To analyze electron transport, we employ the open-boundary non-equilibrium Green's function method. By studying the conductivity of GPNL and graphene under voltage bias up to 300 mV, we gain valuable insights into the electrical transport properties of GPNL under optical absorption conditions. The findings from our computational modeling approach might contribute to a deeper understanding of the potential applications of GPNL in hydrogen production and advanced electronic devices.

Title: $ϕ^n$ trajectory bootstrap
Authors: Wenliang Li
Abstract: We perform an extensive bootstrap study of Hermitian and non-Hermitian theories based on the novel analytic continuation of $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ in $n$. We first use the quantum harmonic oscillator to illustrate various aspects of the $\phi^n$ trajectory bootstrap method, such as the large $n$ expansion, matching conditions, exact quantization condition, and high energy asymptotic behavior. Then we derive highly accurate solutions for the anharmonic oscillators with the parity invariant potential $V(\phi)=\phi^2+\phi^{m}$ and the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant potential $V(\phi)=-(i\phi)^{m}$ for a large range of integral $m$, showing the high efficiency and general applicability of this new bootstrap approach. For the Hermitian quartic and non-Hermitian cubic oscillators, we further verify that the non-integer $n$ results for $\langle\phi^n\rangle$ or $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ are consistent with those from the wave function approach. In the $\mathcal{PT}$ invariant case, the existence of $\langle(i\phi)^n\rangle$ with non-integer $n$ allows us to bootstrap the non-Hermitian theories with non-integer powers, such as fractional and irrational $m$.

Title: Engineering Hierarchical Symmetries
Authors: Zhanpeng Fu, Roderich Moessner, Hongzheng Zhao, Marin Bukov
Abstract: The capacity to custom tailor the properties of quantum matter and materials is a central requirement for enlarging their range of possible functionalities. A particularly promising route is the use of driving protocols to engineer specific desired properties with a high degree of control and flexibility. Here, we present such a program for the tunable generation of sequences of symmetries on controllable timescales. Concretely, our general driving protocol for many-body systems generates a sequence of prethermal regimes, each exhibiting a lower symmetry than the preceding one. We provide an explicit construction of effective Hamiltonians exhibiting these symmetries, which imprints emergent quasiconservation laws hierarchically, enabling us to engineer the respective symmetries and concomitant orders in nonequilibrium matter. We provide explicit examples, including spatiotemporal and topological phenomena, as well as a spin chain realizing the symmetry ladder $\text{SU(2)}{\rightarrow}\text{U(1)} {\rightarrow} \mathbb{Z}_2{\rightarrow} E$. Our results have direct applications in experiments with quantum simulators.

Title: Diagrammatics, Pentagon Equations, and Hexagon Equations of Topological Orders with Loop- and Membrane-like Excitations
Authors: Yizhou Huang, Zhi-Feng Zhang, Peng Ye
Abstract: In spacetime dimensions of 4 (i.e., 3+1) and higher, topological orders exhibit spatially extended excitations like loops and membranes, which support diverse topological data characterizing braiding, fusion, and shrinking processes, despite the absence of anyons. Our understanding of these topological data remains less mature compared to 3D, where anyons have been extensively studied and can be fully described through diagrammatic representations. Inspired by recent advancements in field theory descriptions of higher-dimensional topological orders, this paper systematically constructs diagrammatic representations for 4D and 5D topological orders, generalizable to higher dimensions. We introduce elementary diagrams for fusion and shrinking processes, treating them as vectors in fusion and shrinking spaces, respectively, and build complex diagrams by combining these elementary diagrams. Within these vector spaces, we design unitary operations represented by \(F\)-, \(\Delta\)-, and \(\Delta^2\)-symbols to transform between different bases. We discover \textit{pentagon equations} and \textit{(hierarchical) shrinking-fusion hexagon equations} that impose constraints on the legitimate forms of these unitary operations. We conjecture that all anomaly-free higher-dimensional topological orders must satisfy these conditions and any violations indicate a quantum anomaly. This work opens promising avenues for future research, including the exploration of diagrammatic representations involving braiding and the study of non-invertible symmetries and symmetry topological field theories in higher spacetime dimensions.

Title: Quantum control of ion-atom collisions beyond the ultracold regime
Authors: Maks Z. Walewski, Matthew D. Frye, Or Katz, Meirav Pinkas, Roee Ozeri, Michał Tomza
Abstract: Tunable scattering resonances are crucial for controlling atomic and molecular systems. However, their use has so far been limited to ultracold temperatures. These conditions remain hard to achieve for most hybrid trapped ion-atom systems -- a prospective platform for quantum technologies and fundamental research. Here we measure inelastic collision probabilities for ${\text{Sr}^++\text{Rb}}$ and use them to calibrate a comprehensive theoretical model of ion-atom collisions. Our theoretical results, compared with experimental observations, confirm that quantum interference effects persist to the multiple-partial-wave regime, leading to the pronounced state and mass dependence of the collision rates. Using our model, we go beyond interference and identify a rich spectrum of Feshbach resonances at moderate magnetic fields with the Rb atom in its lower ($f=1$) hyperfine state, which persist at temperatures as high as 1 mK. Future observation of these predicted resonances should allow precise control of the short-range dynamics in ${\text{Sr}^+}+{\text{Rb}}$ collisions under unprecedentedly warm conditions.

Title: Ringdown in the SYK model
Authors: Matthew Dodelson
Abstract: We analyze thermal correlators in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model away from the maximally chaotic limit. Despite the absence of a weakly curved black hole dual, the two point function decomposes into a sum over a discrete set of quasinormal modes. To compute the spectrum of modes, we analytically solve the Schwinger-Dyson equations to a high order in perturbation theory, and then numerically fit to a sum of exponentials using a technique analogous to the double cone construction. The resulting spectrum has a tree-like structure which is reminiscent of AdS black holes with curvature singularities. We present a simple toy model of stringy black holes that qualitatively reproduces some aspects of this structure.

Title: Non-iterative Triples for Transcorrelated Coupled Cluster Theory
Authors: Maximilian Mörchen, Alberto Baiardi, Michał Lesiuk, Markus Reiher
Abstract: We present an implementation of a perturbative triples correction for the coupled cluster ansatz including single and double excitations based on the transcorrelated Hamiltonian. Transcorrelation introduces explicit electron correlation in the electronic Hamiltonian through similarity transformation with a correlation factor. Due to this transformation, the transcorrelated Hamiltonian includes up to three-body couplings and becomes non-Hermitian. Since the conventional coupled cluster equations are solved by projection, it is well suited to harbor non-Hermitian Hamiltonians. The arising three-body operator, however, creates a huge memory bottleneck and increases the runtime scaling of the coupled cluster equations. As it has been shown that the three-body operator can be approximated, by expressing the Hamiltonian in the normal-ordered form, we investigate this approximation for the perturbative triples correction. Results are compared with a code-generation based transcorrelated coupled cluster implementation up to quadruple excitations.

Title: Transient subtraction: A control variate method for computing transport coefficients
Authors: Pierre Monmarché, Renato Spacek, Gabriel Stoltz
Abstract: In molecular dynamics, transport coefficients measure the sensitivity of the invariant probability measure of the stochastic dynamics at hand with respect to some perturbation. They are typically computed using either the linear response of nonequilibrium dynamics, or the Green--Kubo formula. The estimators for both approaches have large variances, which motivates the study of variance reduction techniques for computing transport coefficients. We present an alternative approach, called the \emph{transient subtraction technique} (inspired by early work by Ciccotti and Jaccucci in 1975), which amounts to simulating a transient dynamics started off equilibrium and relaxing towards the equilibrium state, from which we subtract a sensibly coupled equilibrium trajectory, resulting in an estimator with smaller variance. We present the mathematical formulation of the transient subtraction technique, give error estimates on the bias and variance of the associated estimator, and demonstrate the relevance of the method through numerical illustrations for various systems.

Title: Absorbing State Phase Transitions and Stability of Long-Range Coherence in Dissipative Quantum State Preparation
Authors: Matthew Wampler, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: We investigate the absorbing state phase transition in a purely dissipative quantum reaction-diffusion model where the absorbing state itself has long range phase coherence. The model may also be viewed as a dissipative quantum state preparation procedure for the (generalized) W-state with errors. The 'error' Lindblad jump operators preserve the W-state as a dark state, but nonetheless act to decohere the system and induce the phase transition. We find cases where the preparation protocol is either fragile or robust against weak error quantum jump rates, and show that remnants of the coherence persist even after the phase transition to the decohering phase. Furthermore, we argue that the long range coherence of the absorbing state leads to critical behavior distinct from Directed Percolation, the typical universality class for reaction-diffusion models.

Title: Fundamental bounds on precision and response for quantum trajectory observables
Authors: Tan Van Vu
Abstract: The precision and response of trajectory observables offer valuable insights into the behavior of nonequilibrium systems. For classical systems, trade-offs between these characteristics and thermodynamic costs, such as entropy production and dynamical activity, have been established through uncertainty relations. Quantum systems, however, present unique challenges, where quantum coherence can enhance precision and violate classical uncertainty relations. In this study, we derive trade-off relations for stochastic observables in Markovian open quantum systems. Specifically, we present three key results: (i) a quantum generalization of the thermo-kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the relative fluctuations of currents in terms of entropy production and dynamical activity; (ii) a quantum inverse uncertainty relation, which constrains the relative fluctuations of arbitrary counting observables based on their instantaneous fluctuations and the spectral gap of the symmetrized Liouvillian; and (iii) a quantum response kinetic uncertainty relation, which bounds the response of general observables to kinetic perturbations in terms of dynamical activity. These fundamental bounds, validated numerically using a three-level maser and a boundary-driven XXZ spin chain, provide a comprehensive framework for understanding the interplay between precision, response, and thermodynamic costs in quantum systems.

Title: Measurement of the work statistics of an open quantum system using a quantum computer
Authors: Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Michele Campisi
Abstract: We report on the experimental measurement of the work statistics of a genuinely open quantum system using a quantum computer. Such measurement has remained elusive thus far due to the inherent difficulty in measuring the total energy change of a system-bath compound (which is the work) in the open quantum system scenario. We overcome this difficulty by extending the interferometric scheme, originally conceived for closed systems, to the open system case and implement it on a superconducting quantum computer, taking advantage of the relatively high levels of noise on current quantum hardware to realize an open quantum system. We demonstrate that the method can be used as a diagnostic tool to probe physical properties of the system-bath compound, such as its temperature and specific transitions frequencies in its spectrum. Our experiments corroborate that the interferometric scheme is a promising tool to achieve the long-sought experimental validation of the Jarzynski equality for arbitrary open quantum systems.

Title: Evaluating many-body stabilizer Rényi entropy by sampling reduced Pauli strings: singularities, volume law, and nonlocal magic
Authors: Yi-Ming Ding, Zhe Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: We present a novel quantum Monte Carlo method for evaluating the $\alpha$-stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE) for any integer $\alpha\ge 2$. By interpreting $\alpha$-SRE as partition function ratios, we eliminate the sign problem in the imaginary-time path integral by sampling reduced Pauli strings within a reduced configuration space, which enables efficient classical computations of $\alpha$-SRE and its derivatives to explore magic in previously inaccessible 2D/higher-dimensional systems. Physically, we first separate the free energy contribution in $2$-SRE. At quantum critical points in 1D/2D transverse field Ising (TFI) models, we reveal nontrivial singularities associated with the characteristic function contribution, directly tied to magic. Their interplay leads to complicated behaviors of $2$-SRE, avoiding extrema at critical points generally. In contrast, by analyzing the volume-law correction of magic, which represents nonlocal magic residing in correlations, we find that its discontinuity is bound to critical properties and would be more useful than the full-state magic. Finally, we verify that $2$-SRE fails to characterize magic in mixed states (e.g. Gibbs states), yielding nonphysical results. This work provides a powerful tool for exploring the roles of magic in large-scale many-body systems, and reveals intrinsic relation between magic and many-body physics.

Title: Noise-resilient solid host for electron qubits above 100 mK
Authors: Xinhao Li, Christopher S. Wang, Brennan Dizdar, Yizhong Huang, Yutian Wen, Wei Guo, Xufeng Zhang, Xu Han, Xianjing Zhou, Dafei Jin
Abstract: Cryogenic solid neon has recently emerged as a pristine solid host for single electron qubits. At ~10 mK temperatures, electron-on-solid-neon (eNe) charge qubits have exhibited exceptionally long coherence times and high operation fidelities. To advance this platform towards a scalable quantum information architecture, systematic characterization of its noise feature is imperative. Here, we show the remarkable resilience of solid neon against charge and thermal noises when eNe qubits are operated away from the charge-insensitive sweet-spot and at elevated temperatures. Without optimizing neon growth, the measured charge (voltage) noise on solid neon is already orders of magnitude lower than that in most stringently grown semiconductors, rivaling the best records to date. Up to 400 mK, the eNe charge qubits operated at ~5 GHz can maintain their echo coherence times over 1 microsecond. These observations highlight solid neon as an ideal host for quantum information processing at higher temperatures and larger scales.

Title: Distribution of singular values in large sample cross-covariance matrices
Authors: Arabind Swain, Sean Alexander Ridout, Ilya Nemenman
Abstract: For two large matrices ${\mathbf X}$ and ${\mathbf Y}$ with Gaussian i.i.d.\ entries and dimensions $T\times N_X$ and $T\times N_Y$, respectively, we derive the probability distribution of the singular values of $\mathbf{X}^T \mathbf{Y}$ in different parameter regimes. This extends the Marchenko-Pastur result for the distribution of eigenvalues of empirical sample covariance matrices to singular values of empirical cross-covariances. Our results will help to establish statistical significance of cross-correlations in many data-science applications.

Title: Evolution of cooperation in a bimodal mixture of conditional cooperators
Authors: Chenyang Zhao, Xinshi Feng, Guozhong Zheng, Weiran Cai, Jiqiang Zhang, Li Chen
Abstract: Extensive behavioral experiments reveal that conditional cooperation is a prevalent phenomenon. Previous game-theoretical studies have predominantly relied on hard-manner models, where cooperation is triggered only upon reaching a specific threshold. However, this approach contrasts with the observed flexibility of human behaviors, where individuals adapt their strategies dynamically based on their surroundings. To capture this adaptability, we introduce a soft form of conditional cooperation by integrating the Q-learning algorithm from reinforcement learning. In this form, players not only reciprocate mutual cooperation but may also defect in highly cooperative environments or cooperate in less cooperative settings to maximize rewards. To explore the effects of hard and soft conditional cooperators, we examine their interactions in two scenarios: structural mixture (SM) and probabilistic mixture (PM), where the two behavioral modes are fixed and probabilistically adopted, respectively. In SM, hard conditional cooperators enhance cooperation when the threshold is low but hinder it otherwise. Surprisingly, in PM, the cooperation prevalence exhibits two first-order phase transitions as the probability is varied, leading to high, low, and vanishing levels of cooperation. Analysis of Q-tables offers insights into the "psychological shifts" of soft conditional cooperators and the overall evolutionary dynamics. Model extensions confirm the robustness of our findings. These results highlight the novel complexities arising from the diversity of conditional cooperators.

Title: Vortex Dynamics in Tubular Fluid Membranes
Authors: Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Arpan Saha, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We construct 2D viscous flow sourced by a point vortex embedded in a thin tubular membrane, coupled to external embedding fluids. The cylinder topology enforces the creation of an additional saddle in the flow field, consistent with Poincaré Index Theorem. In this setup, the incompressibility of the membrane fluid can be utilized to cast the dynamics of a multi-vortex system in the form of a Hamiltonian on the cylinder, which depends on the fluid viscosities and vortex strengths. The cylinder geometry breaks the in-plane rotational symmetry of the membrane and leads to several interesting features in the multi-vortex dynamics, distinct from flat and spherical fluid membranes. For a two vortex system of same circulation, we observe closed orbits with the inter-vortex separation oscillating in time. The compact angular direction of the membrane tube also allows two distinct closed orbits instead of one, under suitable initial conditions. Vortex pairs (vortices with opposite circulation) move together along helical geodesics in accordance with a conjecture by Kimura, Proceedings of the Royal Society A, Vol 455 (1999). We also explore relative equilibria of multi-vortex systems in this setup and demonstrate vortex leapfrogging via numerical simulations. Our results will be interesting in the context of microfluidic flows arising in nature as well as experimental studies in membrane tubes similar to PNAS 108 (31) 12605-12610 (2011).
