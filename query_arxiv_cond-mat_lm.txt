Title: Fracture toughness and auxeticity in disordered metamaterials
Authors: Hannes Holey, Andrea Lorenzo Henri Sergio Detry, Silvia Bonfanti, Roberto Guerra, Anshul D. S. Parmar, Jacopo Fiocchi, Ausonio Tuissi, Michael Zaiser, Stefano Zapperi
Abstract: Auxetic metamaterials are commonly thought to exhibit favorable mechanical properties, notably high energy absorption. Here we investigate disordered metamaterials obtained from random beam networks by optimizing simultaneously auxeticity and the energy absorbed before fracture. By giving different weights to these optimization targets, we demonstrate that the optimal configurations are connected along a Pareto front where high auxeticity implies comparatively low energy absorption and vice versa. We study the mechanical properties of the resulting metamaterials and characterize the different deformation modes obtained for distinct optimization targets. The simulation and optimization results are validated by comparison with the deformation behavior of additively manufactured samples. Our work provides an illustration of the potentials and limitations of multi-objective optimization in the design of disordered mechanical metamaterials

Title: Defect Networks for Topological Phases Protected By Modulated Symmetries
Authors: Daniel Bulmash
Abstract: Modulated symmetries are internal symmetries which do not commute with spatial symmetries; dipolar symmetries are a prime example. We give a general recipe for constructing topological phases protected by modulated symmetries via a defect network construction, generalizing the crystalline equivalence principle to modulated symmetries. We demonstrate that modulated symmetries can be treated identically to unmodulated symmetries in the absence of spatial symmetries, but in the presence of spatial symmetries, some defect networks which are non-anomalous for unmodulated symmetries become anomalous for modulated symmetries. We apply this understanding to classify symmetry-protected topological phases protected by translation symmetry plus either discrete or continuous dipolar symmetries in (1+1)D and (2+1)D and obtain a number of other (1+1)D classification results for modulated symmetry-protected topological phases.

Title: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquid and emergent photons in a 2D spin-1 model
Authors: Nils Niggemann, Meghadeepa Adhikary, Yannik Schaden-Thillmann, Johannes Reuther
Abstract: Gapless fracton quantum spin liquids are exotic phases of matter described by higher-rank U(1) gauge theories which host gapped and immobile fracton matter excitations as well as gapless photons. Despite well-known field theories, no spin models beyond purely classical systems have been identified to realize these phases. Using error-controlled Green function Monte Carlo, here we investigate a square lattice spin-1 model that shows precise signatures of a fracton quantum spin liquid without indications of conventional ordering. Specifically, the magnetic response exhibits characteristic patterns of suppressed pinch points that accurately match the prediction of a rank-2 U(1) field theory and reveals the existence of emergent photon excitations in 2+1 spacetime dimensions. Remarkably, this type of fracton quantum spin liquid is not only identified in the system's ground state but also in generic low-energy sectors of a strongly fragmented Hilbert space.

Title: Classical fracton spin liquid and Hilbert space fragmentation in a 2D spin-$1/2$ model
Authors: Nils Niggemann, Meghadeepa Adhikary, Yannik Schaden-Thillmann, Johannes Reuther
Abstract: Classical U(1) fracton spin liquids feature an extensive ground state degeneracy and follow an effective description in terms of a tensor Gauss' law where charges, so-called fractons, have restricted mobility. Here we introduce a simple spin model that realizes such a state by straightforward discretization of the higher-rank gauge theory on a square lattice. The simplicity of this construction offers direct insights into the system's fundamental fractonic properties, such as real-space fracton configurations, height-field representation of the classical ground state manifold as well as properties of local and non-local fluctuations within the fracton-free subspace. By sampling classical Ising states from the extensive ground state manifold, we show that the effective tensor Gauss' law remains intact when explicitly enforcing the spin-1/2 length constraint, demonstrating the existence of a classical Ising fracton spin liquid. However, we observe that perturbative quantum effects are insufficient to efficiently tunnel between classical ground states, leading to severe Hilbert space fragmentation which obscures fractonic quantum behavior. Specifically, by simulating the spin-1/2 quantum model with Green function Monte Carlo as a function of the Rokhsar-Kivelson potential, we find that the system supports either magnetic long-range order or a classical spin liquid. Our findings highlight the crucial role of Hilbert-space fragmentation in fractonic spin systems but also indicate ways to mitigate such effects via increasing the spin magnitude to $S=1$, investigated in a companion paper.

Title: Real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in Rydberg-atom lattice gauge theory
Authors: De-Sheng Xiang, Peng Zhou, Chang Liu, Hao-Xiang Liu, Yao-Wen Zhang, Dong Yuan, Kuan Zhang, Biao Xu, Marcello Dalmonte, Dong-Ling Deng, Lin Li
Abstract: Understanding the non-equilibrium dynamics of gauge theories remains a fundamental challenge in high-energy physics. Indeed, most large scale experiments on gauge theories intrinsically rely on very far-from equilibrium dynamics, from heavy-ion to lepton and hadron collisions, which is in general extremely challenging to treat ab initio. Quantum simulation holds intriguing potential in tackling this problem and pioneering experiments have observed different characteristic features of gauge theories, such as string breaking and false vacuum decay. Here, using a programmable Rydberg atom array, we observe real-time scattering and freeze-out dynamics in a (1+1)-dimensional U(1) lattice gauge theory. Through spatiotemporal Hamiltonian engineering, we demonstrate dynamical confinement-deconfinement transitions, revealing string fragmentation and symmetry restoration during quenches. We track scattering processes with single-site resolution across a range of parameter regimes. Utilizing a double quench protocol, we observe dynamical freeze-out: upon quenching the Hamiltonian after scattering, despite the injection of an extensive energy, the system evolution -- in terms of both low-order correlations and entanglement -- freezes, effectively stabilizing a highly correlated equilibrium state -- a situation that reminisces that of collisions between heavy ions. Our work establishes a high-resolution approach for probing non-perturbative gauge dynamics, opening alternative pathways toward studying far-from-equilibrium phenomena in high-energy physics.

Title: Benchmarking Self-Driving Labs
Authors: Adedire D. Adesiji, Jiashuo Wang, Cheng-Shu Kuo, Keith A. Brown
Abstract: A key goal of modern materials science is accelerating the pace of materials discovery. Self-driving labs, or systems that select experiments using machine learning and then execute them using automation, are designed to fulfil this promise by performing experiments faster, more intelligently, more reliably, and with richer metadata than conventional means. This review summarizes progress in understanding the degree to which SDLs accelerate learning by quantifying how much they reduce the number of experiments required for a given goal. The review begins by summarizing the theory underlying two key metrics, namely acceleration factor AF and enhancement factor EF, which quantify how much faster and better an algorithm is relative to a reference strategy. Next, we provide a comprehensive review of the literature, which reveals a wide range of AFs with a median of 6, and that tends to increase with the dimensionality of the space, reflecting an interesting blessing of dimensionality. In contrast, reported EF values vary by over two orders of magnitude, although they consistently peak at 10-20 experiments per dimension. To understand these results, we perform a series of simulated Bayesian optimization campaigns that reveal how EF depends upon the statistical properties of the parameter space while AF depends on its complexity. Collectively, these results reinforce the motivation for using SDLs by revealing their value across a wide range of material parameter spaces and provide a common language for quantifying and understanding this acceleration.

Title: Radiative Heat Transfer and 2D Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Materials
Authors: Long Ma, Dai-Nam Le, Lilia M. Woods
Abstract: Radiative heat transfer is of great interest from a fundamental point of view and for energy harvesting applications. This is a material dependent phenomenon where confined plasmonic excitations, hyperbolicity and other properties can be effective channels for enhancement, especially at the near field regime. Materials with reduced dimensions may offer further benefits of enhancement compared to the bulk systems. Here we study the radiative thermal power in the family of transition metal dichalcogenide monolayers in their H- and T-symmetries. For this purpose, the computed from first principles electronic and optical properties are then used in effective models to understand the emerging scaling laws for metals and semiconductors as well as specific materials signatures as control knobs for radiative heat transfer. Our combined approach of analytical modeling with properties from ab initio simulations can be used for other materials families to build a materials database for radiative heat transfer.

Title: Digital generation of the 3-D pore architecture of isotropic membranes using 2-D cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy images
Authors: Sima Zeinali Danalou, Hooman Chamani, Arash Rabbani, Patrick C. Lee, Jason Hattrick Simpers, Jay R Werber
Abstract: A major limitation of two-dimensional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) in imaging porous membranes is its inability to resolve three-dimensional pore architecture and interconnectivity, which are critical factors governing membrane performance. Although conventional tomographic 3-D reconstruction techniques can address this limitation, they are often expensive, technically challenging, and not widely accessible. We previously introduced a proof-of-concept method for reconstructing a membrane's 3-D pore network from a single 2-D SEM image, yielding statistically equivalent results to those obtained from 3-D tomography. However, this initial approach struggled to replicate the diverse pore geometries commonly observed in real membranes. In this study, we advance the methodology by developing an enhanced reconstruction algorithm that not only maintains essential statistical properties (e.g., pore size distribution), but also accurately reproduces intricate pore morphologies. Applying this technique to a commercial microfiltration membrane, we generated a high-fidelity 3-D reconstruction and derived key membrane properties. Validation with X-ray tomography data revealed excellent agreement in structural metrics, with our SEM-based approach achieving superior resolution in resolving fine pore features. The tool can be readily applied to isotropic porous membrane structures of any pore size, as long as those pores can be visualized by SEM. Further work is needed for 3-D structure generation of anisotropic membranes.

Title: Potassium polytungstate nanoparticles by combustion aerosol technology for benzene sensing
Authors: Adrien Baut, Sebastian Kravecz, Andreas T. Guentner
Abstract: Polytungstates are oxygen-linked assemblies of highly oxidized tungsten polyhedra, valued for their tunability and stability in diverse applications. Traditional synthesis methods (hydrothermal, solvothermal, solid-state) offer material variety but are limited in scalability and their ability to yield nanostructured materials due to long reaction times and high temperatures. Here, we introduce flame aerosol synthesis as a single-step, rapid and dry method to prepare K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$ nanoparticulate powders and coatings. Thereby, monocrystalline and phase-pure K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  with varying crystal-sizes were obtained by controlling flame temperature, residence time and metal ion concentration during particle formation by nucleation, coagulation and sintering. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy identified the high potassium tolerance of the K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  lattice (K/W ratio up to 0.6) and phase stability up to 400 $^\circ$C, before other polytungstates and WO$_3$ polymorphs were formed, respectively. Porous films of such K$_2$W$_7$O$_{22}$  nanoparticles featured n-type semiconductor behavior that was utilized for the chemoresistive quantification of the air pollutant benzene down to 0.2 parts-per-million at 20% relative humidity. Such sensors were quite selective over other compounds (e.g. alcohols, aldehydes, ketones, CO, NH$_3$ or H$_2$), in particular to chemically similar toluene and xylene (>18).

Title: Engineering snags for spatial curvature in weaves: Fabrication, mechanics, and inverse design
Authors: Guowei Wayne Tu, Evgueni T. Filipov
Abstract: Weaving as an old craft has extensive applications in modern science and technology such as smart textiles and intelligent soft robots. However, weaving irregular curved surfaces has been difficult, with prior alternatives requiring curved ribbons and triaxial weaving patterns. In this work, we present a simple strategy to achieve complex spatial curvature by purposely introducing 'snags', a traditionally unwanted textile defect, into dense plain weaves consisting of straight ribbons assembled in a straightforward biaxial network. We detail the fabrication methodology where we pull out ribbons of initially smooth two- (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) plain weaves to form local snags. We show that these local defects cause global curvatures through the propagation of geometric frustration. We then use a reduced-order bar & hinge model to simulate the mechanics-guided deformation of snagged plain weaves, and we investigate how the curvature scales with system parameters such as the thickness and Young's modulus of the ribbons. Finally, we introduce an inverse design platform where an evolutionary algorithm is used to inversely compute the optimal snag patterns of smooth plain weaves to approximate arbitrary target surfaces including 2D and 3D woven exoskeletons that fit human legs and elbows, respectively. Engineering snags in plain weaves as a general strategy can pave the way for future design of customizable wearable devices, adaptive soft robots, reconfigurable architecture, and more.

Title: Role of Large Language Models and Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Accelerating Crystalline Material Discovery: A Systematic Review
Authors: Agada Joseph Oche, Arpan Biswas
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have emerged as powerful tools for knowledge-intensive tasks across domains. In materials science, to find novel materials for various energy efficient devices for various real-world applications, requires several time and cost expensive simulations and experiments. In order to tune down the uncharted material search space, minimizing the experimental cost, LLMs can play a bigger role to first provide an accelerated search of promising known material candidates. Furthermore, the integration of LLMs with domain-specific information via retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) is poised to revolutionize how researchers predict materials structures, analyze defects, discover novel compounds, and extract knowledge from literature and databases. In motivation to the potentials of LLMs and RAG in accelerating material discovery, this paper presents a broad and systematic review to examine the recent advancements in applying LLMs and RAG to key materials science problems. We survey state-of-the-art developments in crystal structure prediction, defect analysis, materials discovery, literature mining, database integration, and multi-modal retrieval, highlighting how combining LLMs with external knowledge sources enables new capabilities. We discuss the performance, limitations, and implications of these approaches, and outline future directions for leveraging LLMs to accelerate materials research and discovery for advancement in technologies in the area of electronics, optics, biomedical, and energy storage.

Title: Incommensuration in odd-parity antiferromagnets
Authors: Changhee Lee, Nico A. Hackner, P. M. R. Brydon
Abstract: Inversion-asymmetric antiferromagnets (AFMs) with odd-parity spin-polarization pattern have been proposed as a new venue for spintronics. These AFMs require commensurate ordering to ensure an effective time-reversal symmetry, which guarantees a strictly antisymmetric spin polarization of the electronic states. Recently, nonsymmorphic centrosymmetric crystals have been identified as a broad class of materials which could exhibit unit-cell doubling magnetism with odd-parity spin-polarization. Here we investigate the stability of these states against incommensuration. We first demonstrate that the symmetry conditions which permit a p-wave spin polarization pattern also permit the existence of a non-relativistic Lifshitz invariant in the phenomenological Ginzburg-Landau free energy. This implies magnetism with an incommensurate ordering vector, independent of its microscopic origin. AFMs with f- or h-wave spin-polarization are also prone to incommensurability, especially when they have an itinerant origin. Here the symmetry which ensures the odd-parity spin-polarization also guarantees the existence of van Hove saddle points off the time-reversal-invariant momenta, which promote incommensurate spin fluctuations in quasi-two-dimensional electronic systems. Finally, we study the effect of weak spin-orbit coupling in locally noncentrosymmetric materials and find that it favors antiferromagnetic phases with in-plane magnetic moments. However, the inclusion of the spin-orbit coupling also introduces a new mechanism for driving incommensuration. Our results imply that odd-parity AFMs are likely to be preceded by an incommensurate phase, or emerge directly from the normal state via a first order transition. These conclusions are consistent with the phase diagram of several candidate materials.

Title: Models for polymer dynamics from dimensionality reduction techniques
Authors: Phillip Bement, Joerg Rottler
Abstract: Polymer dynamics is analyzed through the lens of linear dimensionality reduction methods, in particular principal (PCA) and time-lagged independent component analysis (tICA). For a polymer undergoing ideal Rouse dynamics, the slow modes identified by these transformations coincide with the conventional Rouse modes. When applied to the Fourier modes of the segment density, we show that tICA generates dynamics equivalent to dynamic self-consistent field theory (D-SCFT) with a wavevector-dependent Onsager coefficient and a free energy functional subject to the random phase approximation (RPA). We then introduce a hidden variable method and a time-local approach to include temporal memory in the tICA-generated dynamics, and generalize it to construct continuum models for the nonequilibrium case of spinodal decomposition of a symmetric diblock copolymer melt.

Title: Design of high-mobility p-type GaN via the piezomobility tensor
Authors: Jie-Cheng Chen, Joshua Leveillee, Chris G. Van de Walle, Feliciano Giustino
Abstract: Gallium nitride (GaN) is a wide-bandgap semiconductor of significant interest for applications in solid-state lighting, power electronics, and radio-frequency amplifiers. An important limitation of this semiconductor is its low intrinsic hole mobility, which hinders the development of \textit{p}-channel devices and the large-scale integration of GaN CMOS in next-generation electronics. Prior research has explored the use of strain to improve the hole mobility of GaN, but a systematic analysis of all possible strain conditions and their impact on the mobility is lacking. In this study, we introduce a piezomobility tensor notation to characterize the relationship between applied strain and hole mobility in GaN. To map the strain-dependence of the hole mobility, we solve the \textit{ab initio} Boltzmann transport equation, accounting for electron-phonon scattering and GW quasiparticle energy corrections. We show that there exist three optimal strain configurations, two uniaxial strains and one shear strain, that can lead to significant mobility enhancement. In particular, we predict room-temperature hole mobility of up to 164~\mob\ for 2\% uniaxial compression and 148~\mob\ for 2\% shear strain. Our methodology provides a general framework for investigating strain effects on the transport properties of semiconductors from first principles.

Title: Topological hydrodynamics in spin-triplet superconductors
Authors: Chau Dao, Eric Kleinherbers, Bjørnulf Brekke, Yaroslav Tserkovnyak
Abstract: Due to the structure of the underlying SO(3) $\mathbf d$-vector order parameter, spin triplet superconductors exhibit a bulk-edge correspondence linking the circulation of supercurrent to the bulk magnetic skyrmion density, giving rise to topological hydrodynamics of magnetic skyrmions. To probe the interplay of charge and spin dynamics, we propose a blueprint for a spin-triplet superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID), which functions without a Josephson weak link. The triplet SQUID undergoes nonsingular $4\pi$ phase slips, in which current relaxation is facilitated by spin dynamics that trace out a magnetic skyrmion texture. Inductively coupling the device to a tank circuit and probing the nonlinear supercurrent response via Oersted field measurements could provide an experimental signature of ferromagnetic spin-triplet superconductivity.

Title: Impact of Ge substrate Thicknesses and Epitaxy Growth Conditions on the Optical and Material Properties of Ge- and GaAs-based VCSELs
Authors: Wenhan Dong, Zeyu Wan, Yun-Cheng Yang, Chao-Hsin Wu, Yiwen Zhang, Rui-Tao Wen, Guangrui Xia
Abstract: We present a comparative study of the optical and material property dependences of VCSELs on Ge or GaAs substrate thicknesses and epitaxy process conditions. It was found that adjusting the Ge substrate thickness and optimizing the epitaxy process can shift the stopband center and cavity resonance wavelength by several nanometers. Ge-based VCSELs exhibit improved epitaxial uniformity, smaller deviations from design specifications, reduced stoichiometry variations, and strain magnitudes comparable to those of GaAs-based counterparts. In the selected 46.92 square micron sample area, no defects were observed in the quantum well (QW) regions of Ge-based VCSELs, and the threading dislocation density (TDD) was measured to be below 2.13e6 per square cm. These results highlight the potential of Ge substrates as promising candidates for advanced VCSELs.

Title: Magnetically Mediated Cross-Layer Pairing in Pressurized Trilayer Nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$
Authors: Jialin Chen, Chuanshu Xu, Qiaoyi Li, Wei Li
Abstract: The recently discovered trilayer nickelate superconductor La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ under pressure has emerged as a promising platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity. However, the pairing mechanism remains a subject of active investigations. With large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on a realistic two-orbital trilayer Hubbard model, we elucidate the superconducting (SC) mechanism in this system. Our results reveal distinct magnetic correlations in the two different orbitals: while the $d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits both interlayer and cross-layer antiferromagnetic (AFM) correlations, the $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital shows exclusively cross-layer AFM correlations, rendering a quasi-long-range SC order in the latter. We demonstrate that the Hund's rule coupling is essential for forming the SC order, and discuss the effects of kinetic AFM correlation and Hubbard repulsive $U$. Our findings motivate a further simplification of the trilayer Hubbard to an effective bilayer mixed-dimensional $t$-$J$ model, providing a unified framework for understanding interlayer SC in both trilayer and bilayer nickelates.

Title: Observation of anomalous Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators
Authors: Huahui Qiu, Shuaishuai Tong, Qicheng Zhang, Kun Zhang, Chunyin Qiu
Abstract: Non-Abelian topological phases, which go beyond traditional Abelian topological band theory, are garnering increasing attention. This is further spurred by periodic driving, leading to predictions of many novel multi-gap Floquet topological phases, including anomalous Euler and Dirac string phases induced by non-Abelian Floquet braiding, as well as Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNTIs) that exhibit multifold bulk-edge correspondence. Here, we report the first experimental realization of anomalous FNTIs, which demonstrate topological edge modes in all three gaps despite having a trivial bulk charge. Concretely, we construct an experimentally feasible one-dimensional three-band Floquet model and implement it in acoustics by integrating time-periodic coupling circuits to static acoustic crystals. Furthermore, we observe counterintuitive topological interface modes in the domain-wall formed by an anomalous FNTI and its counterpart with swapped driving sequences, modes previously inaccessible in Floquet Abelian systems. Our work paves the way for further experimental exploration of the uncharted non-equilibrium topological physics.

Title: Observation of Anti-helical Edge States in Acoustic Metamaterials
Authors: Tianzhi Xia, Qicheng Zhang, Chunyin Qiu
Abstract: As a hallmark of the quantum Hall effect, chiral edge modes (CEMs) counterpropagate along the two parallel edges of a ribbon structure. However, recent studies demonstrate counterintuitive antiCEMs that copropagate along the parallel edges. Analogous to the established extension of the CEMs to helical edge modes (HEMs) in the quantum spin Hall effect, it is natural to extend the antiCEMs to antiHEMs, which comprise a pair of time-reversal-related antiCEMs. In this Letter, we report the first observation of the antiHEMs based on a bilayer model that features staggered positive and negative interlayer hoppings. Experimentally, we implement this anti-helical model on an acoustic platform and provide compelling evidence for the antiHEMs by selectively exciting different spin subspaces, along with identifying the energybiased Dirac points in bulk spectra. Our findings may offer new insights into topological phases of matter and potentially pave the way for designing novel devices with unique edge transport properties.

Title: Observation and Control of Chiral Spin Frustration in BiYIG Thin Films
Authors: Jinlong Wang, Hanchen Wang, Zhewen Xu, Artim L. Bassant, Junfeng Hu, Wenjie Song, Chaozhong Li, Xiangrui Meng, Mengqi Zhao, Song Liu, Guozhi Chai, Peng Gao, Wanjun Jiang, Desheng Xue, Dapeng Yu, William Legrand, Christian L. Degen, Rembert A. Duine, Pietro Gambardella, Haiming Yu
Abstract: Chiral interactions within magnetic layers stabilize the formation of noncollinear spin textures, which can be leveraged to design devices with tailored magnetization dynamics. Here, we introduce chiral spin frustration in which energetically degenerate magnetic states frustrate the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We demonstrate magnon-driven switching of the chirally frustrated spin states in Bi-substituted yttrium iron garnet thin films. These states are defined by an in-plane macrospin neighboring two out-ofplane spins on either side with opposing chirality. Using scanning nitrogen-vacancy magnetometry and spin pumping, we identified four degenerate frustrated states and achieved their controllable switching via magnon spin torque. Crucially, the switching is unidirectional, with selectivity determined by the incoming magnon direction. This mechanism provides a powerful approach to manipulate frustrated spin states with magnons. Chiral spin frustration unlocks the geometry constraints of conventional frustration, and therefore opens new horizons for frustrated magnetism, paving the way for energy-efficient spintronic devices based on frustratio

Title: Grain Boundaries in Ceramic Solid-State Lithium Metal Batteries: A Review
Authors: Md Salman Rabbi Limon, Abrar Fahim Navid, Curtis Wesley Duffee, Zeeshan Ahmad
Abstract: It is now widely accepted that grain boundaries play a critical role in the performance and reliability of solid-state batteries with lithium metal anodes. Understanding and controlling grain boundaries is essential for enabling safe, high-rate operation of solid-state batteries. This review explores the multifaceted influence of grain boundaries in ceramic solid electrolytes and metal anodes, including their impact on ionic and electronic transport, dendrite and void formation, connecting them to the failure mechanisms. We discuss the formation and structure of space charge layers at grain boundaries, their role in modulating local defect chemistry, and the conditions under which grain boundaries may serve as fast-ion pathways or as vulnerable sites for failure. We highlight key differences in the grain boundaries of different classes of solid electrolytes and advances in modeling, experimental characterization, and processing techniques to understand the complexity and engineer grain boundaries in solid electrolytes. Finally, we outline key open questions and opportunities for grain boundary engineering to stimulate further progress in the field.

Title: Ab-initio heat transport in defect-laden quasi-1D systems from a symmetry-adapted perspective
Authors: Yu-Jie Cen, Sandro Wieser, Georg K. H. Madsen, Jesús Carrete
Abstract: Due to their aspect ratio and wide range of thermal conductivities, nanotubes hold significant promise as heat-management nanocomponents. Their practical use is, however, often limited by thermal resistance introduced by structural defects or material interfaces. An intriguing question is the role that structural symmetry plays in thermal transport through those defect-laden sections. To address this, we develop a framework that combines representation theory with the mode-resolved Green's function method, enabling a detailed, symmetry-resolved analysis of phonon transmission through defected segments of quasi-1D systems. To avoid artifacts inherent to formalisms developed for bulk 3D systems, we base our analysis on line groups, the appropriate description of the symmetries of quasi-1D structures. This categorization introduces additional quantum numbers that partition the phonon branches into smaller, symmetry-distinct subsets, enabling clearer mode classification. We employ an Allegro-based machine learning potential to obtain the force constants and phonons with near-ab-initio accuracy. We calculate detailed phonon transmission profiles for single- and multi-layer MoS$_\mathrm{2}$-WS$_\mathrm{2}$ nanotubes and connect the transmission probability of each mode to structural symmetry. Surprisingly, we find that pronounced symmetry breaking can suppress scattering by relaxing selection rules and opening additional transmission channels. That higher disorder introduced through defects can enhance thermal transport, and not just suppress it, demonstrates the critical role of symmetry in deciphering the nuances of nanoscale thermal transport.

Title: Strange-like Metallicity in a Toy Model with Selective-Mottness
Authors: M. S. Laad, S. R. Hassan
Abstract: The interplay between band and atomic aspects in materials with co-existing wide-band and flat-band states, or wide-band and effectively dispersionless electronic states is increasingly expected to lead to novel behavior. Using dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT), we investigate strange-metal-like behavior and emergence of unconventional superconductivity in a toy model that captures this interplay. Surprisingly, we find good accord with transport features seen in underdoped cuprates and ladder Fe-arsenides. We connect our findings to proposals of FL$^{*}$ and orthogonal Fermi liquids, and present a route to it's direct instability to novel, competing orders.

Title: A hinge effect that anomalously decreases the stiffness of slender fiber-reinforced composite structures
Authors: Vivek Khatua, Debashish Das, G. K. Ananthasuresh
Abstract: We present experimental evidence for an anomalous decrease in stiffness in a fiber-reinforced polymer composite because of the embedded fiber. A shell with carbon fiber showed about 20% less stiffness and 100% more strength under compressive loading. We ruled out the role of debonding of fiber due to imperfect impregnation by using a fiber-pullout test, which revealed that the fiber-matrix interface is strong in the direction of the fiber. Therefore, we hypothesize that a fiber allows the matrix material to rotate around it as in a hinge. We corroborate this phenomenon, which we call the hinge effect, with analytical modelling and experimental data for small and large deformations of a fiber embedded in slender composite beams. We also demonstrate the design of foldable and deployable sheets with hill and valley folds enabled by the embedded fibers. Moreover, the hinge effect warrants further research into physics of how fibers in slender composite structures give rise to the anomalous flexibility. This effect can be gainfully used in designing novel origami structures and compliant mechanisms should be flexible and strong.

Title: Performance of the Extended Ising Machine for the Quadratic Knapsack Problem
Authors: Haruka Akishima, Hirotaka Tamura, Kazue Kudo
Abstract: The extended Ising machine (EIM) enhances conventional Ising models, which handle only binary quadratic forms by allowing constraints through real-valued dependent variables. We address the quadratic knapsack problem (QKP), hard to solve using Ising machines when formulated as a quadratic unconstrained binary optimization (QUBO). We demonstrated the EIM's superiority by comparing it with the conventional Ising model-based approach, a commercial exact solver, and a state-of-the-art heuristic solver for QKP.

Title: Probing Fermi surface topology by ultrafast pump pulse dynamics
Authors: Debamalya Dutta, Kush Saha
Abstract: We present a dynamical approach to detect changes in Fermi surface topology in a two-band model. Specifically, we show that the system's response to a low intensity light pulse can precisely identify topological Lifshitz transitions. At a suitable frequency, the light resonantly couples valence and conduction electrons, leading to an oscillation in the interband coherence term. This, in turn, generate a persistent oscillatory current which survives even after the end of the pulse. Notably, the relative amplitude of the oscillatory current during the pulse with that of the post-pulse reaches a minimum when the Fermi energy aligns with the saddle point, providing a robust framework for dynamically identifying Lifshitz transitions.

Title: Unveiling the Puzzle of Brittleness in Single Crystal Iridium
Authors: Qing Cheng, Sergey V. Erohin, Konstantin V. Larionov, Bin Gan, Pavel B. Sorokin, Xiandong Xu
Abstract: Iridium is critical for extreme-environment applications due to its exceptional thermal stability and corrosion resistance, but its intrinsic brittleness remains a decades-old puzzle. Combining atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscopy, density first-principles calculations, and discrete dislocation dynamics simulations, we identify high-density, sessile Frank dislocation loops with zero-net Burgers vectors as the key mechanism. These loops form via an energetically favorable transformation from mixed perfect dislocations under stress, a process unique to iridium among face-centered cubic metals. The immobile loops act as potent barriers, drastically increasing yield strength and work hardening by impeding dislocation glide and consuming mobile dislocations. This dominance of these findings deepens the understanding of iridium's brittleness and offers a pathway for designing more ductile variants of this critical material.

Title: Efficient GW calculations for metals from an accurate ab initio polarizability
Authors: Giacomo Sesti, Alberto Guandalini, Andrea Ferretti, Pino D'Amico, Claudia Cardoso, Massimo Rontani, Daniele Varsano
Abstract: Despite its success in the study of spectroscopic properties, the $GW$ method presents specific methodological challenges when applied to systems with metallic screening. Here, we present an efficient and fully ab-initio implementation for the calculation of the screened potential, specifically designed for 3D and 2D metals. It combines a Monte Carlo integration with an appropriate interpolation of the screened potential between the calculated grid points (W-av), complemented with an extrapolation to the long-wavelength limit, able to seamlessly account for the so-called intraband term. This method greatly accelerates the convergence of GW calculations for metals while improving their accuracy, due to the correct description of the intraband transitions in the long wavelength limit, as shown here for 3D metals and doped monolayers, such as MoS$_2$ and graphene. The use of W-av results in an excellent agreement with ARPES measurements for monolayer doped MoS$_2$. Furthermore, for graphene we show that more robust results are found with the use of higher-order Lorentzians in the description of the self-energy, together with the solution of the QP equation beyond the linearized approximation.

Abstract: Altermagnets are a novel class of materials that combine antiferromagnetic spin ordering with non-relativistic spin splitting (NRSS) in their band structure, making them promising candidates for spintronics applications without requiring strong spin-orbit coupling. In this work, we investigate a two-dimensional bilayer Mott insulator that exhibits altermagnetic order. The interplay between spin and layer degrees of freedom gives rise to a complex symmetry-breaking pattern involving both magnetic and interlayer-coherent components. A key control parameter in the system is the layer polarization, which can be tuned via an external gate voltage. We show that applying an in-plane electric field with opposite signs in the two layers induces a polarization current that drives a spin current in each layer. While the polarization current is isotropic, the resulting spin current exhibits strong anisotropy and can be reversed by adjusting the photon energy. These findings suggest new avenues for manipulating spin transport in altermagnetic systems via electric and optical means.

Title: Coulombic control of charge transfer in luminescent radicals with long-lived quartet states

Abstract: Excitons in organic materials are emerging as an attractive platform for tunable quantum technologies. Structures with near-degenerate doublet and triplet excitations in linked trityl radical, acene and carbazole units can host quartet states. These high spin states can be coherently manipulated, and later decay radiatively via the radical doublet transition. However, this requires controlling the deexcitation pathways of all metastable states. Here we establish design rules for efficient quartet generation in luminescent radicals, using different connection arrangements of the molecular units. We discover that electronic coupling strength between these units dictates luminescence and quartet formation yields, particularly through the energetics of an acene-radical charge transfer state, which we tune Coulombically. This state acts as a source of non-radiative decay when acene-radical separation is small, but facilitates doublet-quartet spin interconversion when acene-radical separation is large. Using these rules we report a radical-carbazole-acene material with 55% luminescence yield, where 94% of emitting excitons originate from the quartet at microsecond times. This reveals the central role of molecular topology in luminescent quantum materials.

Title: Anomalous Hall and Nernst effects in the Two-Dimensional ferromagnetic metal FePd2Te2
Authors: Yazhou Li, Jiaxing Liao, Jiajun Ma, Yuwei Zhang, Tao Li, Jialu Wang, Hangdong Wang, Hanjie Guo, Jianhui Dai, Yuke Li
Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric effect enables simpler, more flexible thermoelectric devices by generating electricity perpendicular to heat flow, offering promising solutions for waste heat recovery and solid-state cooling applications. Here, we report a striking observation of zero-field anomalous Hall effect (AHE) and anomalous Nernst effect (ANE) below TC in the two-dimensional metallic magnet FePd2Te2. The anomalous Nernst signal Syx^A peaks a maximum value of 0.15 {\mu}V/K at 100 K, much larger than that of conventional FM materials. Remarkably, the derived ratio alpha_ij/sigma_ij in FePd2Te2 approaches the fundamental limit of 86 {\mu}V/K. Our findings suggest a dominant Berry curvature contribution to the ANE. The observed giant zero-field anomalous Nernst response in 2D FePd2Te2 not only advances fundamental understanding of transverse thermoelectricity in layered magnets, but also provides this material as a promising candidate for practical thermoelectric spintronic applications.

Title: Mechanism of Anisotropic Crystallization and Phase Transitions under Van der Waals Squeezing
Authors: Yuxiang Gao, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Mechanical confinement strategies, such as van der Waals (vdW) squeezing, have emerged as promising routes for synthesizing non-vdW two-dimensional (2D) layers, surprisingly yielding high-quality single crystals with lateral sizes approaching 100 micrometer. However, the underlying mechanisms by which such a straightforward approach overcomes the long-standing synthesis challenges of non-vdW 2D materials remains a puzzle. Here, we investigate the crystallization dynamics and phase evolution of Bi under vdW confinement through molecular dynamics (MD) simulations powered by a machine-learning force filed fine-tuned and distilled from a pre-trained model with DFT-level accuracy. We reveal that pressure-dependent layer modulation arises from a quantum confinement-driven anisotropic crystallization mechanism, in which out-of-plane layering occurs nearly two orders of magnitude faster than in-plane ordering. Two critical transitions are identified: an alpha-to-beta phase transformation at 1.64 GPa, and a subsequent collapse into a single-atomic layer at 2.19 GPa. The formation of large-area single crystals is enabled by substrate-induced orientational selection and accelerated grain boundary migration, driven by atomic diffusion at elevated temperatures. These findings resolve the mechanistic origin of high-quality 2D crystal growth under confinement and establish guiding principles for the controlled synthesis of metastable 2D single crystals, with implications for next-generation quantum and nanoelectronic devices.

Title: Explainable AI for Curie Temperature Prediction in Magnetic Materials
Authors: M. Adeel Ajaib, Fariha Nasir, Abdul Rehman
Abstract: We explore machine learning techniques for predicting Curie temperatures of magnetic materials using the NEMAD database. By augmenting the dataset with composition-based and domain-aware descriptors, we evaluate the performance of several machine learning models. We find that the Extra Trees Regressor delivers the best performance reaching an R^2 score of up to 0.85 $\pm$ 0.01 (cross-validated) for a balanced dataset. We employ the k-means clustering algorithm to gain insights into the performance of chemically distinct material groups. Furthermore, we perform the SHAP analysis to identify key physicochemical drivers of Curie behavior, such as average atomic number and magnetic moment. By employing explainable AI techniques, this analysis offers insights into the model's predictive behavior, thereby advancing scientific interpretability.

Title: Randomly twisted bilayer graphene -- the cascade transitions
Authors: Baruch Horovitz, Pierre Le Doussal
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) is known to have disorder in its twist angle. We show that in terms of a Dirac equation with a random gauge potential ${\bf A}({\bf r})$ this disorder becomes huge when the average twist angle is near the magic angle where the Dirac velocity vanishes. The density of states (DOS) then diverges at the Dirac point as $\rho(E)\sim E^{(2/z)-1}$ with $z\gg 1$ and we deduce that all electrons occupy energies very near $E=0$. We prove a sum rule on the disorder averaged eigenfunctions from which we deduce that each added electron contributes equal intraband Coulomb interaction energy. The various bands in TBG are related by either ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow {\bf A}({-\bf r})$ or ${\bf A}({\bf r})\rightarrow -{\bf A}({\bf r})$ which affects the interband interaction energy. We find, within Hartree-Fock, jumps in the chemical potential at each integer filling, accounting for the cascade transitions.

Title: VASPilot: MCP-Facilitated Multi-Agent Intelligence for Autonomous VASP Simulations
Authors: Jiaxuan Liu, Tiannian Zhu, Caiyuan Ye, Zhong Fang, Hongming Weng, Quansheng Wu
Abstract: Density-functional-theory (DFT) simulations with the Vienna Ab initio Simulation Package (VASP) are indispensable in computational materials science but often require extensive manual setup, monitoring, and postprocessing. Here, we introduce VASPilot, an open-source platform that fully automates VASP workflows via a multi-agent architecture built on the CrewAI framework and a standardized Model Context Protocol (MCP). VASPilot's agent suite handles every stage of a VASP study-from retrieving crystal structures and generating input files to submitting Slurm jobs, parsing error messages, and dynamically adjusting parameters for seamless restarts. A lightweight Flask-based web interface provides intuitive task submission, real-time progress tracking, and drill-down access to execution logs, structure visualizations, and plots. We validate VASPilot on both routine and advanced benchmarks: automated band-structure and density-of-states calculations (including on-the-fly symmetry corrections), plane-wave cutoff convergence tests, lattice-constant optimizations with various van der Waals corrections, and cross-material band-gap comparisons for transition-metal dichalcogenides. In all cases, VASPilot completed the missions reliably and without manual intervention. Moreover, its modular design allows easy extension to other DFT codes simply by deploying the appropriate MCP server. By offloading technical overhead, VASPilot enables researchers to focus on scientific discovery and accelerates high-throughput computational materials research.

Title: Interplay of distinct modes of charge regulation on poly-acid ionization and conformation
Authors: Souradeep Ghosh, Aritra Chowdhury, Dylan T. Tomares, Benjamin Schuler, Arindam Kundagrami, Rohit V. Pappu
Abstract: We adapt the Edwards-Muthukumar theoretical framework for a single polymer chain to investigate the interplay between proton binding and counterion condensation for poly-acids. We find that changes to pH enable non-monotonic transitions between anti- and conventional polyelectrolyte behaviors. In the former, the net charge and the overall dimensions increase with increasing salt concentration, while the converse is true for conventional polyelectrolytes. The polymeric nature and local solvent polarization drive significant pKa shifts when compared to the values of reference monoacids. These pKa shifts are enhanced in semi-flexible chains.

Title: A Class of Exclusion Processes Capable of Exhibiting Current Reversal
Authors: Ngo Phuoc Nguyen Ngoc, Lam Thi Nhung
Abstract: A century after Ising introduced the Ising measure to study equilibrium systems, its relevance has expanded well beyond equilibrium contexts, notably appearing in non-equilibrium frameworks such as the Katz--Lebowitz--Spohn (KLS) model. In this work, we investigate a class of generalized asymmetric simple exclusion processes (ASEP) for which the Ising measure serves as the stationary state. We show that the average stationary current in these models can display current reversal and other unconventional behaviors, offering new insights into transport phenomena in non-equilibrium systems. Moreover, although long-range interaction rates often give rise to long-range interactions in the potential function, our model provides a counterexample: even with long-range interactions in the dynamics, the resulting potential remains short-ranged. Finally, our framework encompasses several well-known models as special cases, including ASEP, the KLS model, the facilitated exclusion process, the cooperative exclusion process, and the assisted exchange model.

Title: Giant spin Hall effects and topological surface states in ternary-layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3)
Authors: Yanhui Chen, Hong-Yan Lu, Wenjin Yang, Meifeng Liu, Bin Cui, Desheng Liu, Bing Huang, Xi Zuo
Abstract: In this work, we report a systematic study of the electronic structures, band topology, and intrinsic spin Hall effect (SHE) of the layered MAX carbides Mn+1AlCn (M= Nb, Ta, n=1, 2, 3) and explore the correlation effects on the SHE. The results show that M3AlC2 and M4AlC3 (M= Nb, Ta) share similar Dirac-band-crossing features near the Fermi level (EF) and form nodal lines in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). When the SOC is included, the Dirac band crossings are fully gapped, resulting in nontrivial Z2 topological invariants (1;000) with a pair of surface states on the (001) plane. Remarkably, the multiple gapped Dirac points contribute to locally strong spin Berry curvatures, which lead to large spin Hall conductivities and a giant spin Hall angle up to ~ 60% for Ta3AlC2. Moreover, we also elucidate the impact of Hubbard U correction on SHC. Our findings indicate that Ta3AlC2 might represent an intriguing layered Z2 topological metal with superior charge-to-spin conversion efficiency.

Title: Electron Energy Loss Spectra Simulations of Coupled Phonon and Magnon Excitations
Authors: José Ángel Castellanos-Reyes (1), Anders Bergman (1), Ivan P. Miranda (2), Ján Rusz (1) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Uppsala University, Uppsala, Sweden, (2) Department of Physics and Electrical Engineering, Linnaeus University, Kalmar, Sweden)
Abstract: We simulate momentum-resolved electron energy loss spectra (EELS) in body-centered cubic iron at 300 K, capturing the effects of coupled phonon and magnon excitations within a unified dynamical formalism. By extending the Time Autocorrelation of Auxiliary Wavefunctions (TACAW) method to incorporate atomistic spin-lattice dynamics (ASLD), we simulate the full EELS signal - including interaction effects, dynamical diffraction, and multiple scattering. Our results reveal non-additive spectral features arising from phonon-magnon coupling, including interference and energy redistribution effects, and predict experimental detectability of magnon signals under optimized detector conditions. This framework advances quantitative magnon spectroscopy in STEM, establishing a direct link between dynamical theory and low-energy experimental EELS signatures.

Title: A Novel Computational Thermodynamics Framework with Intrinsic Chemical Short-Range Order
Authors: Chuliang Fu
Abstract: Chemical short-range order (SRO) provides new opportunities for tuning alloy properties, but conventional computational thermodynamics frameworks such as CALPHAD, based on Bragg-Williams mean-field approximations, cannot properly describe SRO or order-disorder transformations in multicomponent ($\geq$3) alloys. First-principles approaches combined with the cluster variation method (CVM) or cluster expansion method (CEM) can capture SRO but suffer from high computational cost. Here we present a hybrid CVM-CALPHAD framework with a thermodynamic solid solution model named as FYL-CVM, enabled by the Fowler-Yang-Li (FYL) transform to reduce the number of variables required in free-energy minimization. This achieves efficient modeling of SRO in multicomponent systems within the CALPHAD formalism. Benchmark tests on fcc AB binaries show that FYL-CVM reproduces CVM phase diagrams with much higher efficiency, while non-configurational contributions from vibrational, elastic, and electronic terms are also incorporated to capture their physical effects on order-disorder boundaries. Applied to the Cu-Au system, this method produces phase diagrams with experimental data in an efficient parameterization and elucidates the temperature-composition dependence of SRO parameters via the SRO diagram. Its applicability to ternary alloys is also demonstrated for the Cu-Au-Ag system. Overall, this framework strikes a balance between accuracy and efficiency, extends CALPHAD to account for chemical SRO, and enables a comprehensive physics-informed modeling of ordering phenomena.

Title: Wannier Center Analysis on Possible Three-Dimensional Topological Phases in α-Type Layered Organic Conductors
Authors: Toshihito Osada
Abstract: Topological features of possible three-dimensional (3D) states in \alpha-type layered organic conductors are investigated within a unified framework based on Wannier charge centers (WCCs), aiming to identify their actual topological states. Among the 3D Dirac/Weyl semimetal states of multilayered \alpha-(ET)2I3, the type-I Dirac semimetal state, induced by interlayer spin-orbit coupling (SOC), most effectively explains the observed chiral transport phenomena attributed to the chiral magnetic effect, which originates from the spiral structures of the WCC sheets. In multilayered \alpha-(BETS)2I3, a 3D weak topological insulator (TI) state consistently emerges, irrespective of the presence of interlayer SOC and/or inversion symmetry breaking. The strong TI state suggested by experimental observations appears unlikely to be realized.

Title: Ferroelectric switching of interfacial dipoles in $α$-RuCl$_3$/graphene heterostructure
Authors: Soyun Kim, Jo Hyun Yun, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Joseph Falson, Jun Sung Kim, Kyung-Hwan Jin, Gil Young Cho, Youngwook Kim
Abstract: We demonstrate electrically switchable, non-volatile dipoles in graphene/thin hBN/$\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ heterostructures, stabilized purely by interfacial charge transfer across an atomically thin dielectric barrier. This mechanism requires no sliding or twisting to explicitly break inversion symmetry and produces robust ferroelectric-like hysteresis loops that emerge prominently near 30~K. Systematic measurements under strong in-plane and out-of-plane magnetic fields reveal negligible effects on the hysteresis characteristics, confirming that the primary mechanism driving the dipole switching is electrostatic. Our findings establish a distinct and robust route to electrically tunable ferroelectric phenomena in van der Waals heterostructures, opening opportunities to explore the interplay between interfacial charge transfer and temperature-tuned barrier crossing of dipole states at the atomic scale.

Title: Deformation of semi-circle law for the correlated time series and Phase transition
Authors: Masato Hisakado, Takuya Kaneko
Abstract: We study the eigenvalue of the Wigner random matrix, which is created from a time series with temporal correlation. We observe the deformation of the semi-circle law which is similar to the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner-Lèvy matrix. The distribution has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. In the absence of correlation, the eigenvalue distribution of the Wigner random matrix is known as the semi-circle law in the large $N$ limit. When there is a temporal correlation, the eigenvalue distribution converges to the deformed semi-circle law which has a longer tail and a higher peak than the semi-circle law. When we created the Wigner matrix using financial time series, we test the normal i.i.d. using the Wigner matrix. We observe the difference from the semi-circle law for FX time series. The difference from the semi-circle law is explained by the temporal correlation. Here, we discuss the moments of distribution and convergence to the deformed semi-circle law with a temporal correlation. We discuss the phase transition and compare to the Marchenko-Pastur distribution(MPD) case.

Title: Experimental evidence for strong emergent correlations between particles in a switching trap
Authors: Marco Biroli, Sergio Ciliberto, Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Artyom Petrosyan, Gregory Schehr
Abstract: We experimentally study a gas of $N = 8$ one-dimensional Brownian particles, each confined in a harmonic trap with identical stiffness. The stiffness switches simultaneously between two values at random Poissonian times. This collective switching drives the system into a non-equilibrium stationary state (NESS) with strong long-range correlations between the positions of the particles. Remarkably, we find that these switching-induced emergent correlations completely overwhelm the hydrodynamic interactions between the particles mediated via the surrounding fluid. Comparing with exact theoretical predictions for noninteracting particles, we observe excellent agreement between theory and experiments for multiple observables, including the correlations between particles, extreme value and order statistics (maxima, minima and ranked positions) and the full counting statistics (i.e., the distribution of the number of particles in a finite interval $[-L, L]$ around the trap center).

Title: Magnetic Moment vs Angular Momentum: Spin Hall Response in Bismuth
Authors: Junji Fujimoto, Yuki Izaki, Yuki Fuseya
Abstract: Spin currents can carry either spin angular momentum or its associated magnetic moment, which are no longer strictly proportional in multiband systems. Using a multiband $k \cdot p$ model, we compute the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity tensors of elemental Bi. The magnetic-moment tensor emerges about two orders of magnitude larger and far less anisotropic than the angular-momentum tensor, while quasiparticle damping activates otherwise longitudinal components. The magnetic-moment spin Hall angle exceeds unity, demonstrating that a clear distinction between the two currents is indispensable for multiband systems.

Title: Reproducibility of high-throughput density-functional-theory calculations
Authors: Chenxi Lu, Musen Li, Jeffrey R. Reimers
Abstract: While standard computational protocols for density functional theory (DFT) have universal applicability, differences exist in code implementations. Specific applications require manual parameter optimization, whereas high-throughput calculations employ predefined workflows. This paper uses the bandgap as a key property to reveal the impact of computational workflow differences on the reproducibility of high-throughput calculation results. The study proposes basic requirements for ensuring reproducibility: using structures optimised using the same procedure as used to calculate properties and ensuring Brillouin zone (k-point) integration grid accuracy. This research establishes a foundation for the reproducibility of DFT calculations and reliable application of results, which is of great significance for method development and artificial intelligence model training.

Title: Light-Wave Engineering for Selective Polarization of a Single $\mathbf{Q}$ Valley in Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Youngjae Kim
Abstract: The selective control of specific momentum valleys lies at the core of valleytronics, a field that has thus far focused primarily on the $\mathbf{K}$ and $\mathbf{K'}$ valleys in transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). However, direct optical access to other low-lying yet conventionally inaccessible valleys such as the sixfold degenerate $\mathbf{Q}$ valleys has remained an outstanding challenge, fundamentally limiting the exploitation of the full valley degree of freedom for information processing. Here, we theoretically introduce an emergent light-wave valley selection rule that enables deterministic and high fidelity excitation of any single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley in monolayer TMDs. By coherently combining a circularly polarized pump pulse with a linearly polarized driver pulse, we engineer distinct quantum pathways that unambiguously excited electrons into a targeted $\mathbf{Q}$ valley, completely decoupled from the conventional $\mathbf{K}/\mathbf{K'}$ valleys. This all-optical scheme achieves near-unity ($\sim$100\%) valley polarization across an exceptionally broad ultrafast window, from the terahertz ($10^{12}$~Hz) to petahertz ($10^{15}$~Hz) regimes, enabling single $\mathbf{Q}$ valley polarization on femtosecond timescales. Our findings establish a new paradigm of light-wave quantum metrology in valleytronics, unlocking the $\mathbf{Q}$-valley subspace for scalable multi-state valley information processing.

Title: Observation of gapless collective charge fluctuations in an Anderson insulating state
Authors: Jong Mok Ok, Beom Jun Park, Junik Hwang, Seonghoon Park, Myeongjun Kang, Jun Sung Kim, Ki-Seok Kim, Seung-Ho Baek
Abstract: Understanding the nature of collective charge dynamics in the Coulomb gap phase is essential for revealing the existence of many-body localization. However, the corresponding many-particle excitation spectra remain poorly understood. Here, we present a comprehensive investigation of $^{27}$Al and $^{63}$Cu nuclear magnetic/quadrupole resonance (NMR/NQR), along with specific heat ($C_p$) measurements, in the $p$-type semiconductor CuAlO$_2$. Our study unveils distinct changes in charge dynamics at two crossover temperature scales which separate three regimes associated with Anderson localization of charge carriers: thermally activated transport ($T>150$ K) $\rightarrow$ Mott variable-range hopping (VRH) $\rightarrow$ Efros-Shklovskii (ES) VRH with Coulomb gap formation ($T<50$ K). In the ES VRH regime, we observe a striking divergence in the zero-field $^{63}$Cu spin-lattice relaxation rate, $(T_1T)^{-1}$, which is strongly suppressed by an applied magnetic field, indicative of quantum critical charge fluctuations. This is further supported by a distinct magnetic field-dependence of $C_p/T$ deep within the Coulomb gap phase. Taken together, these results provide compelling evidence for the emergence of strong, gapless collective charge fluctuations within the Anderson insulating phase where single-particle excitations are gapped.

Title: On the Néel Vector Dependence of X-ray Magnetic Circular Dichroism in Altermagnets
Authors: Jan Kuneš
Abstract: Dependence of x-ray magnetic circular dichroism on the experimental geometry is described by a frequency-dependent Hall vector. Using group theory, we derive a general relationship between the Hall vector and the orientation of the Néel vector $\bL$ in altermagnets within the free valence spin (FVS) approximation, where the spin-orbit coupling of the valence electrons and their exchange interaction with the core electrons are neglected. For a given spin point group, the full $\bL$-dependence of the Hall vector can be expressed in terms of several irreducible spectral functions. This derivation generalizes earlier results for the special cases of MnTe and MnF$_2$. Depending on the system symmetry, XMCD in the FVS approximation may be present, emerge only when the neglected terms are included, or be completely forbidden.

Title: Controlling Single-Pulse Magnetization Switching through Angular Momentum Reservoir Engineering
Authors: B. Kunyangyuen, G. Malinowski, D. Lacour, B. Seng, W. Zhang, S. Mangin, J. Hohlfeld, J. Gorchon, M. Hehn
Abstract: We report a systematic study of single pulse all optical helicity independent switching in CoGd bilayers, revealing that the magnetization reversal dynamics can be tuned over more than three orders of magnitude. By varying the Gd thickness or inserting a Pt spacer layer between Co and Gd, we control the angular momentum transferred from the rare earth sublattice to the transition metal sublattice. Our results show that when Gd is abundant and strongly coupled to Co, angular momentum is efficiently transferred during Gd demagnetization, leading to ultrafast Co reversal. In contrast, reducing the Gd thickness or introducing a Pt barrier impedes this transfer, resulting in a domain growth mediated reversal on nanosecond and possibly to microsecond timescales as previously observed in CoDy and CoHo alloys. As a result, in rare earth transition metal systems, replacing Gd with heavier rare-earth elements such as Dy or Ho slows down the switching due to a reduced angular momentum transfer towards Co upon demagnetization as demonstrated in CoGdDy alloys. Our findings establish angular momentum availability and transfer pathways as key parameters governing AO HIS dynamics, offering a unified framework for fast and slow magnetization reversal across rare earth transition metal systems.

Title: Bipartite entanglement and surface criticality
Authors: Yanzhang Zhu, Zenan Liu, Zhe Wang, Yan-Cheng Wang, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Recent works on the scaling behaviors of entanglement entropy at the SO(5) deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP) sparked a huge controversy. Different bipartitions gave out totally different conclusions for whether the DQCP is a unitary conformal field theory. In this work, we connect two previously disconnected fields -- the many-body entanglement and the surface criticality -- to reveal the behaviors of entanglement entropy in various bipartite scenarios, and point out what kind of bipartition truly reflects the criticality of the bulk. We have found that the correspondence between the entanglement spectrum and the edge energy spectrum still persists even at a bulk-gapless point (e.g. critical point), thereby influencing the behavior of entanglement entropy.

Title: Intercalation-Induced Near Room-Temperature Ferromagnetism in CrI3 via Synergistic Exchange Pathways
Authors: Qing-Han Yang, Jia-Wen Li, Xin-Wei Yi, Xiang Li, Jing-Yang You, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: The development of room-temperature magnetic semiconductors is critical for advancing spintronic technologies, yet van der Waals magnets like CrI3 exhibit intrinsically low Curie temperatures (Tc = 45 K). This study employs first-principles calculations to demonstrate that atom intercalation, particularly lithium (Li), dramatically enhances magnetic exchange couplings in CrI3, achieving near room-temperature ferromagnetism with a predicted Tc of 286 K-aligning with experimental reports of 420 K. The underlying mechanism involves synergistic superexchange and double-exchange interactions: intercalation reduces the |Ep-Ed| energy difference between iodine p-orbitals and chromium d-orbitals, strengthening superexchange pathways, while charge transfer induces valence mixing (e.g., Cr3+ to Cr2+, as confirmed by experimental X-ray photoelectron spectrometry data), promoting double-exchange. Theoretical predictions extend to other intercalants including Cu and Na, with Cu0.25CrI3 and Na0.25CrI3 exhibiting Tc of 267 K and 247 K, respectively, establishing a versatile strategy for designing high-Tc magnetic semiconductors. This work bridges theoretical insights with experimental validation, offering a transferable framework for intercalation-driven material design and accelerating practical spintronic device realization.

Title: Linear and nonlinear optical responses in Green's function formula
Authors: Maoyuan Wang, Jianhui Zhou, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Linear and nonlinear optical effect has been widely discussed in large quantity of materials using theoretical or experimental methods. Except linear optical conductivity, higher-order nonlinear responses are not studied fully. Starting from density operator method, we derive optical conductivities of different orders in Green's function formula, and also connect them to novel physical quantities, such as Berry curvature, Berry curvature dipole, third-order nonlinear Hall conductivity and so on. Based on the advantages of Green's function formulas, we believe that these formulas have a lot of benefits for many-body effect study in high-order nonlinear optical responses.

Title: Conical Intersections Shed Light on Hot Carrier Cooling in Quantum Dots
Authors: Caitlin V. Hetherington, Nila Mohan T. M., Shanu A. Shameem, Warren F. Beck, Benjamin G. Levine
Abstract: Experimental observations of vibronic coherences in electronically excited colloidal semiconductor nanocrystals offer a window into the ultrafast dynamics of hot carrier cooling. In previous work, we showed that, in amine-passivated quantum dots (QDs), these coherences arise during relaxation through a cascade of conical intersections between electronically excited states. Here, we demonstrate the generality of this framework by application to QDs with surface-bound carboxylate ligands. A model involving a similar cascade of conical intersections accurately reproduces the frequencies of vibronic coherences observed with broadband multidimensional spectroscopy. The impact of ligands on the relaxation dynamics is attributed to two distinct mechanisms involving either electronic or vibrational coupling between the core and ligands. Compared to the amine-passivated QDs studied previously, the electronic coupling mechanism is less prominent in carboxylate-passivated QDs. Furthermore, comparison of acetate and formate ligands reveals that truncating the ligand alkyl chains alters the relaxation behavior predicted by the model.

Title: Experimental Realization of the Topologically Nontrivial Phase in Monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$
Authors: Xiaochun Huang, Lingxiao Zhao, Rui Xiong, Wenbin Li, Bao-tian Wang, Baisheng Sa, Matthias Bode
Abstract: The free-standing monolayer Si$_2$Te$_2$ (ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$) has been theoretically predicted to host a room-temperature quantum spin Hall phase. However, its experimental realization remains challenge due to the absence of a three-dimensional counterpart. Here, we demonstrate that HfTe$_2$ serves as an ideal substrate for the epitaxial growth of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, preserving its topological phase. Scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy confirm a strain-free ${(1 \times 1)}$ lattice of ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$, along with a sizable band gap, which is well captured by first-principles calculations. Moreover, distinct edge states, independent of step geometry and exhibiting a broad spatial distribution, are observed at ML-Si$_2$Te$_2$ step edges, underscoring its topological nature.

Title: Nonequilibrium Work Fluctuations in Force-induced Melting of a Short B-DNA
Authors: S. Siva Nasarayya Chari, Prabal K. Maiti
Abstract: A system of a solvated canonical B-DNA of 12 base pairs with the specified sequence is initially equilibrated in a state of zero external force $f$ acting on it. After equilibration, a switching experiment is performed over the system by pulling one end of the DNA while restraining its other end. The finite time pulling process is performed at a constant rate of the applied force until a maximum value of 400 pN. The associated nonequilibrium work done $(W)$ during this process is determined by numerically integrating the force-extension curve as a function of the applied force. An ensemble of the work values, $P(W)$, is obtained by repeating the pulling experiment a large number of times. We determine the free energy difference $(\Delta F)$ between the equilibrium and force-induced melted states of the DNA by employing the Jarzynski equality. The value of $\Delta F$ is found to be in close agreement with the conventional equilibrium methods.

Title: Probing the limits of effective temperature consistency in actively driven systems
Authors: Dima Boriskovsky, Rémi Goerlich, Benjamin Lindner, Yael Roichman
Abstract: We investigate the thermodynamic properties of a single inertial probe driven into a nonequilibrium steady-state by random collisions with self-propelled active walkers. The probe and walkers are confined within a gravitational harmonic potential. We evaluate the robustness of the effective temperature concept in this active system by comparing values of distinct, independently motivated definitions: a generalized fluctuation-dissipation relation, a kinetic temperature, and a work fluctuation relation. Our experiments reveal that, under specific conditions, these independent measurements yield a remarkably consistent effective temperature over a wide range of system configurations. Furthermore, we also identify regimes where this consistency breaks down, which delineates the fundamental limits of extending equilibrium-like thermodynamic concepts to athermal, actively driven systems.

Title: Magnetic Field Induced Quantum Metric Dipole in Dirac Semimetal Cd3As2
Authors: Tong-Yang Zhao, An-Qi Wang, Zhen-Tao Zhang, Zheng-Yang Cao, Xing-Yu Liu, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: The quantum geometry, comprising Berry curvature and quantum metric, plays a fundamental role in governing electron transport phenomena in solids. Recent studies show that the quantum metric dipole drives scattering-free nonlinear Hall effect in topological antiferromagnets, prompting the questions of whether this effect can occur in nonmagnetic systems and be externally tuned by a magnetic field. Our work addresses these frontiers by demonstrating that the quantum metric dipole is actively tuned by an external magnetic field to generate a time-reversal-odd nonlinear Hall response in a nonmagnetic topological Dirac semimetal Cd3As2. Alongside the well-known chiral-anomaly-induced negative longitudinal magnetoresistance, an exotic nonlinear planar Hall effect emerges with increasing magnetic field. Careful scaling analysis indicates that this nonlinear planar Hall effect is controlled by the magnetic-field-modulated quantum metric dipole. Constructing a k.p effective model of the Dirac bands under Zeeman and orbital coupling, we derive the evolution of the quantum metric dipole as a function of the magnetic field, providing a comprehensive explanation of the experimental results. Our results establish a band-structure-based strategy for engineering nonlinear magnetotransport in nonmagnetic materials via the quantum metric dipole, opening a pathway toward magnetic-field-tunable nonlinear quantum devices.

Authors: Taketo Uchida, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: Moiré flat bands in rhombohedral multilayer graphene provide a platform for exploring interaction-driven topological phases, where a single isolated band often forms a Chern band. However, non-Abelian degenerate Chern bands with internal symmetries such as SU($N$) have so far been realized only in highly engineered systems. Here, we show that a doubly degenerate non-Abelian Chern band with Chern number $|C|=1$ emerges spontaneously at filling $\nu=2$ in rhombohedral 3-, 4-, and 5-layer graphene, regardless of the presence of an hBN substrate. Using self-consistent Hartree-Fock calculations, we map out phase diagrams as functions of displacement field and electronic periodicity, and analytically demonstrate that the Fock term drives spontaneous symmetry breaking and generates non-Abelian Berry curvature. Our findings unveil a new class of interaction-driven non-Abelian topological phases, distinct from quantum anomalous Hall and fractional Chern phases.

Title: Insulator-bad metal transition in RNiO$_3$ nickelates beyond Hubbard model and density functional theory
Authors: A. S. Moskvin
Abstract: The insulator-bad metal transition observed in the Jahn-Teller (JT) magnets orthonickelates RNiO$_3$ (R = rare earth or yttrium Y) is considered to be a canonical example of the Mott transition, traditionally described in the framework of the Hubbard $U$-$t$-model and the density functional theory. However, actually the real insulating phase of nickelates is the result of charge disproportionation (CD) with the formation of a system of spin-triplet (S=1) electron [NiO$_6$]$^{10-}$ and spinless (S=0) hole [NiO$_6$]$^{8-}$ centers, equivalent to a system of effective spin-triplet composite bosons moving in a nonmagnetic lattice. Taking account of only charge degree of freedom we develop a novel minimal $U$-$V$-$t_b$-model for nickelates making use of the charge triplet model with the pseudospin formalism and effective field approximation. We show the existence of two types of CD-phases, high-temperature classical CO-phase with the G-type charge ordering of electron and hole centers, and low-temperature quantum CDq-phase with charge and spin density transfer between electron and hole centers, uncertain valence and spin value for NiO$_6$ centers. Model $T$-R phase diagram reproduces main features of the phase diagram found for RNiO$_3$.

Title: Asymmetric-gate Mach--Zehnder interferometry in graphene: Multi-path conductance oscillations and visibility characteristics
Authors: Taegeun Song, Nojoon Myoung
Abstract: Graphene provides an excellent platform for investigating electron quantum interference due to its outstanding coherent properties. In the quantum Hall regime, Mach--Zehnder (MZ) electronic interferometers are realized using p--n junctions in graphene, where electron interference is highly protected against decoherence. In this work, we present a phenomenological framework for graphene-based MZ interferometry with asymmetric p--n junction configurations. We show that the enclosed interferometer area can be tuned by asymmetric gate potentials, and additional MZ pathways emerge in higher-filling-factor scenarios, e.g. $\left(\nu_{n},\nu_{p}\right)=\left(-3,+3\right)$. The resulting complicated beat oscillations in asymmetric-gate MZ interference are efficiently analyzed using a machine-learning--based Fourier transform, which yields improved peak-to-background ratios compared to conventional signal-processing techniques. Furthermore, we examine the impact of the asymmetric gate on the interference visibility, finding that interference visibility is enhanced under symmetric gate conditions.

Title: Supercritical fluids as a distinct state of matter characterized by sub-short-range structural order
Authors: Sha Jin, Xinyang Li, Xue Fan, Matteo Baggioli, Yuliang Jin
Abstract: A supercritical fluid (SCF)--the state of matter at temperatures and pressures above the critical point--exhibits properties intermediate between those of a liquid and a gas. However, whether it constitutes a fundamentally distinct phase or merely a continuous extension of the liquid and gas states remains an open question. Here we show that a SCF is defined by sub-short-range (SSR) structural order in the spatial arrangement of particles, setting it apart from the gas (disordered), liquid (short-range ordered), and solid (long-range ordered) states. The SSR structural order can be characterized by a length scale effectively quantified by the number of observable peaks in the radial distribution function. This length grows from a minimum microscopic value, on the order of the inter-particle distance at the gas-SCF boundary, to a diverging value at the SCF-liquid boundary. Based on the emergence of SSR order, we demonstrate that the transport and dynamical properties of the SCF state, including the diffusion coefficient, shear viscosity, and velocity autocorrelation function, also clearly distinguish it from both the liquid and gas states. Theoretical predictions are validated by molecular dynamics simulations of argon and further supported by existing experimental evidence. Our study confirms and assigns physical significance to the refined phase diagram of matter in the supercritical region, consisting of three distinct states (gas, supercritical fluid, and liquid) separated by two crossover boundaries that follow universal scaling laws.

Title: Singular zero-temperature system
Authors: Q. H. Liu, S. F. Xiao, D. Guo, K. J. Yin
Abstract: It has long been taken for granted that there is only one type of thermodynamic system near absolute zero temperature: the ordinary one compatible with all statements of the third law, with a fundamental yet tacit assumption that all heat capacities in the system vanish as absolute temperature approaches zero. However, in the strict sense, the statements are not mutually equivalent. Once the tacit assumption is released, the inequivalence must remain, and we may have some systems that are only compatible with one or two statements but not all, defining a singular zero-temperature system which can never be excluded from physical feasibility. We revisit some previously proposed theoretical models and identify that they belong to the singular system.

Title: A Spin Glass Characterization of Neural Networks
Authors: Jun Li
Abstract: This work presents a statistical mechanics characterization of neural networks, motivated by the replica symmetry breaking (RSB) phenomenon in spin glasses. A Hopfield-type spin glass model is constructed from a given feedforward neural network (FNN). Overlaps between simulated replica samples serve as a characteristic descriptor of the FNN. The connection between the spin-glass description and commonly studied properties of the FNN -- such as data fitting, capacity, generalization, and robustness -- has been investigated and empirically demonstrated. Unlike prior analytical studies that focus on model ensembles, this method provides a computable descriptor for individual network instances, which reveals nontrivial structural properties that are not captured by conventional metrics such as loss or accuracy. Preliminary results suggests its potential for practical applications such as model inspection, safety verification, and detection of hidden vulnerabilities.

Title: Dissipation-induced Half Quantized Conductance in One-dimensional Topological Systems
Authors: Bozhen Zhou, Pan Zhang, Yucheng Wang, Chao Yang
Abstract: Quantized conductance from topologically protected edge states is a hallmark of two-dimensional topological phases. In contrast, edge states in one-dimensional (1D) topological systems cannot transmit current across the insulating bulk, rendering their topological nature invisible in transport. In this work, we investigate the transport properties of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model with gain and loss, and show that the zero-energy conductance exhibits qualitatively distinct behaviors between the topologically trivial and nontrivial phases, depending on the hybridization and dissipation strengths. Crucially, we analytically demonstrate that the conductance can become half-quantized in the topologically nontrivial phase, a feature absent in the trivial phase. We further show that the half quantization predominantly originates from transport channels involving gain/loss and edge states. Our results uncover a new mechanism for realizing quantized transport in 1D topological systems and highlight the nontrivial role of dissipation in enabling topological signatures in open quantum systems.

Title: Strong and selective magnon-phonon coupling in van der Waals antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$
Authors: Dipankar Jana, Diana Vaclavkova, Rajesh Kumar Ulaganathan, Raman Sankar, Milan Orlita, Clement Faugeras, Maciej Koperski, M. E. Zhitomirsky, Marek Potemski
Abstract: The Raman scattering response of the biaxial antiferromagnet CoPS$_3$ has been investigated as a function of both magnetic field and temperature. The peaks observed in the low-frequency spectral range (90--200~cm$^{-1}$) have been identified as hybrid magnon--phonon excitations. The energies of the bare magnon and phonon modes, as well as the effective coupling strengths between different excitation pairs, have been determined. The strong and selective magnon--phonon interaction largely accounts for the pronounced splitting of two phonon-like modes observed at 152~cm$^{-1}$ and 158~cm$^{-1}$ in the antiferromagnetic phase of CoPS$_3$. Based on the identification of bare magnon excitations and their magnetic-field dependence, we propose an updated set of parameters for the effective exchange ($J_{\mathrm{eff}} = 9.9$~meV) and biaxial magnetic anisotropy ($D = 4.3$~meV and $E = -0.7$~meV) and advocate for an apparent anisotropic $g$-factor ($g_x = g_y = 2$, $g_z = 4$) in the CoPS$_3$ antiferromagnet.

Title: Electronic band structure of a nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe
Authors: Iftakhar Bin Elius, Nathan Valadez, Dante James, Sami Elgalal, Grzegorz Chajewski, Tetiana Romanova, Andrzej Ptok, Dariusz Kaczorowski, Madhab Neupane
Abstract: The LnSbTe family is well known for hosting a plethora of intriguing characteristics stemming from its crystalline symmetry, magnetic structure, 4f electronic correlations and spin orbit coupling (SOC) phenomena. In this paper, we have systematically studied the bulk electrical and thermodynamic properties and electronic structure of the nodal line semimetal candidate ErSbTe using angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) corroborated with first principles based theoretical band structure calculations with and without considering the effect of SOC, a critical factor dictating the band degeneracy which depends on the choice of the Ln atom. Corroborative temperature dependent susceptibility, electrical resistivity and thermodynamic measurements, coherently exhibit paramagnetic to antiferromagnetic phase transition approximately at 1.94 K, and another sharp anomaly at 1.75 K. The zero field cooled resistivity measurement does not show the characteristic hump like feature in the other LnSbTe materials. The electronic band structure of ErSbTe, exhibits a diamond shaped Fermi surface. Along the high symmetry direction GX, electronic bands are projected to cross over the Fermi energy, necessitated by the nonsymmorphic symmetry of the system. The other crossing along this direction is gapped, which evolves along the momentum space reaching its maximum along the GM direction.

Title: Effective toughness estimation by FFT based phase field fracture: application to composites and polycrystals
Authors: Pedro Aranda, Javier Segurado
Abstract: An estimate of the effective toughness of heterogeneous materials is proposed based on the Phase Field Fracture model implemented in an FFT homogenization solver. The estimate is based on the simulation of the deformation of representative volume elements of the microstructure, controlled by a constant energy dissipation rate using an arc-length type control. The definition of the toughness corresponds to the total energy dissipated after the total fracture of the RVE -- which can be accurately obtained thanks to the dissipation control -- divided by the RVE transverse area (length in 2D). The proposed estimate accounts for both the effect of heterogeneity in toughness and elastic response on the overall fracture energy and allows as well to account for phases with anisotropic elastic and fracture response (fracture by cleavage). To improve toughness predictions, crack-tip enrichment is used to model initial cracks. The method is applied to obtain the effective toughness of composites and elastic polycrystals in a series of examples. In the two types of materials, it is found that both heterogeneity in elastic response and fracture energy contribute to increase the effective toughness. Microscopically, it is found that toughening mechanisms are related to the passage of the crack through tougher phases and deviation of the crack path. It is also found that the latter is the controlling mechanism for cases with marked heterogeneity and high anisotropy, eventually provoking toughening saturation for sufficiently high values of heterogeneity or anisotropy.

Title: Aging in a two-dimensional swarmalator crystal with delayed interactions
Authors: Chanin Kumpeerakij, Thiparat Chotibut, Oleg Kogan
Abstract: Time delay can have a significant impact on the properties of collective organization of active matter. In the previous paper [1], we discussed delay-induced breathing in a system of swarmalators - a model coupling particles' internal phases to spatial interactions. Here we build on that study to investigate the aging phenomenon in this system. It is the aging of a two-dimensional crystal with defects and inhomogeneous lattice constants, and takes place after the breathing transients subside. We show that aging proceeds through the gradual elimination of five-fold and seven-fold coordination number defects, which merge pairwise or migrate to the cluster boundary, incrementally increasing the hexatic order parameter in the bulk. Despite this process, defects usually do not fully disappear; some residual number of defects remain frozen in the interior. However, we found that it is possible to achieve a nearly total elimination of coordination number defects at sufficiently low delay - when the surface of the cluster develops a sufficeintly thick fluidized ``boiling layer''. This mechanism of boundary-mediated annealing reveals a non-equilibrium pathway to achieving high crystalline order in the bulk, and raises a tantalizing possibility for controlling defects in active matter with free boundaries.

Title: Correlated electrons in flat bands: Concepts and Developments
Authors: Madhuparna Karmakar
Abstract: When the electronic dispersion in a material is independent of momentum, it gives rise to strongly correlated flat bands, with the single particle energy, quenched. Though the notion of flat bands had been known since long, their experimental realization is achieved much later with the advent of ultra cold atomic gases, followed by photonic lattices, coordination polymers and more recently solid state materials. By the virtue of their quenched kinetic energy scales the flat band materials provide an ideal platform to engineer, customize and investigate the interplay between topology, geometry and strong electronic correlations; giving rise to exotic quantum phases such as, unconventional superconductivity, Mott insulator, non Fermi liquid metals etc. This review presents a comprehensive overview of the theoretical foundation and material realization of the many body systems with flat electronic bands. We discuss the origin of the flat bands and their mathematical construction in prototypical lattices, particularly focussing on those with Lieb and Kagome geometries. Observations made and inferences drawn based on the recent experimental and theoretical investigations are presented along with the framework for a non perturbative numerical approach to address the quantum phases in the flat band materials. By synthesizing insights from both theory and experiment, this review aims to provide a unifying perspective on the emergent many-body phenomena in flat band systems and to outline future directions for the field.

Title: Unified Semiclassical Theory of Nonlinear Hall Effect:Bridging Ballistic and Diffusive Transport Regime
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Haozhi Liao, Guangyun Qi, Hao Geng, Li Sheng, Dingyu Xing
Abstract: The nonlinear Hall effect has attracted considerable attention and undergone extensive investigation in recent years. However, theoretical studies addressing size-dependent effects remain largely unexplored. In this work, we establish a unified semiclassical framework based on the Boltzmann transport equation, incorporating generalized boundary conditions to bridge the ballistic and diffusive transport regimes. Our analysis reveals that the nonlinear Hall effect arises from the combined action of two distinct mechanisms: the Berry curvature dipole and the Fermi-surface integral of Berry curvature. Furthermore, we investigate the Hall effect in topological crystalline insulators (TCIs), elucidating that the size dependence originates from competition between the two transport mechanisms. By connecting the two distinct regimes, our theoretical framework provides a comprehensive understanding of the nonlinear Hall effect in finite-sized systems, offering both fundamental insights and a useful analytical tool for more size-dependent investigations.

Title: Experimental and Computational Demonstration of a Highly Stable, in-situ Pt Decorated Sputtered ZnO Hydrogen Sensor for sub-ppm Level Detection
Authors: Puja Ghosh, Pritam Ghosh, Rizwin Khanam, Chandra Shekhar Prajapati, Aarti Nagarajan, Shreeja Das, Rakesh Paleja, Sharan Shetty, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam, Navakanta Bhat
Abstract: In this work, we present a Pt decorated ZnO thin film-based gas sensor for hydrogen detection, fabricated using a sputtering technique and an in-situ Pt decoration approach. Specifically, we deposit a ZnO thin film on an interdigitated electrode substrate, with Pt nanoclusters added to the (002) polar plane by brief sputtering (1 to 6 s) to create an active sensing interface. Our sensor demonstrates optimal performance at an operating temperature of 498 K, with rapid response and recovery times (10 and 3 s), high selectivity, and long-term stability. We find the Pt decorated ZnO sensor, with a Pt deposition time of 2 s, to exhibit enhanced response (~52,987%) to 1% hydrogen concentration, indicating its suitability for industrial and environmental monitoring applications. Additionally, our device demonstrates reliable detection of low hydrogen concentrations (~100 ppb), with a response of ~38% and no response drift over one year of testing, underscoring the long-term stability of the sensor. To elucidate the role of Pt deposition and pristine ZnO in hydrogen sensing, we perform density functional theory calculations, analysing adsorption and reaction energetics involving H2, O2, O, OH, and H2O, and lattice oxygen atoms on the ZnO (002) surface with and without Pt decoration. Our computational data is in agreement with our experiments, identifying the oxygen-exposed (002) surface to be most active for hydrogen sensing in both pristine and Pt decorated ZnO. Further, our computations highlight the role of Pt in enhancing hydrogen sensitivity via i) activating an autoreduction pathway of adsorbed OH, ii) spontaneous dissociation of adsorbed molecular H2, and iii) keeping the lattice oxygen pathway of forming H2O active. Our systematic approach of designing sensors combining an experimental setup with theoretical insights, is key in developing and optimizing efficient hydrogen gas sensors.

Title: Lack of collisional hydrodynamics in a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas
Authors: Caroline Mauron, Karen V. Kheruntsyan, Giulia De Rosi
Abstract: Using the theory of generalized hydrodynamics, we study the dipole compression collective oscillations of a harmonically trapped one-dimensional Bose gas in the crossover from weak to strong repulsive interactions. In the uniform limit, the system is described by the integrable Lieb-Liniger model, while the presence of the trap breaks integrability. In contrast to previous predictions based on the classical hydrodynamic variational ansatz -- which yields a single-frequency dipole compression mode -- we observe a beating signal comprising two frequencies across all regimes of the gas. Furthermore, we find that the higher frequency crosses over from the low-temperature phononic hydrodynamic regime to the collisionless limit as the temperature increases -- without saturating at the previously predicted value characteristic of the high-temperature collisional hydrodynamic regime. This crossover occurs around the so-called hole-induced anomaly temperature, above which the quasiparticle picture of excitations no longer applies. This explains the absence of the collisional hydrodynamic regime and resolves a long-standing open question about its validity at high temperatures in systems where integrability is nearly broken by weak confinement. Our findings reveal intricate connections between excitations, thermodynamics, correlations, dynamics, and interparticle collisions, and may prove relevant to other atomic, nuclear, solid-state, electronic, and spin systems that exhibit similar anomalies or thermal second-order phase transitions.

Title: Secondary finite-size effects and multi-barrier free energy landscapes in molecular simulations of hindered ion transport
Authors: Omar Khalifa, Brian A. Shoemaker, Amir Haji-Akbari
Abstract: Ion transport through nanoscale channels and pores is pivotal to numerous natural processes and industrial applications. Experimental investigation of the kinetics and mechanisms of such processes is, however, hampered by the limited spatiotemporal resolution of existing experimental techniques. While molecular simulations have become indispensable for unraveling the underlying principles of nanoscale transport, they also suffer from some important technical limitations. In our previous works, we identified strong polarization-induced finite-size effects in molecular dynamics simulations of hindered ion transport, caused by spurious long-range interactions between the traversing ion and the periodic replicates of other ions. To rectify these artifacts, we introduced the Ideal Conductor/Dielectric Model (\textsc{Icdm}), which treats the system as a combination of conductors and dielectrics, and constructs an analytical correction to the translocation free energy profile. Here, we investigate some limitations of this model. Firstly, we propose a generalized approach based on Markov State models that is capable of estimating translocation timescales in the thermodynamic limit for free energy profiles with multiple comparable barriers. Second, we identify a new category of polarization-induced finite-size effects, which significantly alter the spatial distribution of non-traversing ions in smaller systems. These secondary effects cannot be corrected by the ICDM model and must be avoided by selecting sufficiently large system sizes. Additionally, we demonstrate through multiple case studies that finite-size artifacts can reverse expected trends in ion transport kinetics. Our findings underscore the necessity for careful selection of system sizes and the judicious application of the \textsc{Icdm} model to rectify residual finite-size artifacts.

Title: Symmetry-breaking perturbations in the Jahn-Teller-Hubbard model
Authors: Natsuki Okada, Tatsuya Miki, Yusuke Nomura, Philipp Werner, Shintaro Hoshino
Abstract: We study the effect of symmetry-breaking perturbations in the multiorbital Hubbard model coupled to anisotropic Jahn-Teller phonons, which is relevant for the description of fulleride superconductors. This system is often approximated by a model with static antiferromagnetic (AFM) Hund's coupling, in which the coupling to the Jahn-Teller phonon is effectively described, but the retardation effect associated with phonon propagation is neglected. We compare the properties of the models with static AFM Hund's coupling and dynamical Jahn-Teller electron-phonon interaction by means of the Eliashberg theory. Considering the susceptibilities for the spin, magnetic orbital, electric orbital, and superconductivity, we reveal a qualitatively different behavior between the two models in the case of the magnetic orbital susceptibility. We further study the effect of a magnetic field on the $s$-wave spin-singlet superconducting state. In the presence of the field, the magnetic orbital susceptibility becomes nonzero due to a combination of multiorbital and retardation effects, while the spin susceptibility remains zero at low temperatures. By analyzing this phenomenon both numerically and analytically, we clarify that odd-frequency pairs induced by the magnetic field play a crucial role in the spin and orbital magnetic susceptibilities. Thus, the magnetic degrees of freedom produce interesting behaviors in the presence of retardation effects associated with electron-phonon coupling.

Title: ΔSCF Excitation Energies Up a Ladder of Ground-State Density Functionals
Authors: Ethan Pollack, Rohan Maniar, John P. Perdew
Abstract: Density functional theory (DFT) is a widespread and effective tool in electronic structure calculations for ground-state electron systems. Its success has prompted exploration into the use of DFT for non-collective excited states. The delta self-consistent field ($\Delta$SCF) method allows for the extension of DFT to excited-state energies by restricting the Kohn-Sham orbital occupations, producing an excited-state electron density, and then computing its energy. In this paper, we examine the performance of the LSDA, PBE generalized-gradient approximation (GGA), and SCAN/r2SCAN meta-GGA for the excitation energies of several important systems. We consider the energies of atoms with atomic number 1-18. For the hydrogen atom, where we use the exact electron density and have no multiplet splitting, we find significant improvement up the ladder from LSDA to PBE to SCAN. For the uniform gas, we find an effective mass different from the bare mass only with r2SCAN. We split the case of multi-electron atoms into non-aufbau excitations, where the highest-energy electron is excited to the lowest state in the next nl subshell (where accuracy is least limited by available basis sets), and spin-flip excitations, where the spin of an electorn is flipped, leading to a higher-energy state of the same nl configuration. We find reasonably accurate approximate excitation energies, except for the spin-flip cases where the auxiliary non-interacting wavefunction of a non-Hund's-rule spin state is not well-described by a single determinant.

Title: Spin Phonon Coupling and Relaxation time in Lu(II) compound with 9.2GHz clock transition
Authors: Xiaoliang Zhang, Haechan Park
Abstract: Electron spin qubits operating at atomic clock transitions exhibit exceptionally long coherence times, making them promising candidates for scalable quantum information applications. In solid-state systems, interactions between qubits and lattice phonons are known to play a critical role in spin relaxation (T1) and decoherence (T2). In this work, we perform first-principles calculations on a Lu(II) complex spin qubit featuring a prominent clock transition. By employing advanced electronic structure methods, we quantitatively evaluate the influence of phonons on the hyperfine interaction, which serves as the primary spin-lattice coupling mechanism. Treating these phonon-induced variations as first-order perturbations, we apply the Redfield master equation to compute both T1 and T2, along with their temperature dependencies. For T1, we adopt a second quantization formalism to describe phonon interactions, while T2 is evaluated by explicitly integrating acoustic phonon contributions across the full Brillouin zone. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed magnetic field dependence of T2, including the coherence peak near 0.43 T, though the absolute values of T1 and T2 differ by one to two orders of magnitude. Analysis reveals that T1 is primarily governed by longitudinal phonons, whereas T2 is most strongly influenced by mid-wavelength, mid-energy acoustic modes. These findings provide a quantitative demonstration of the clock transition protective effect on spin qubit coherence and offer a transferable computational framework for evaluating spin-phonon interactions in other molecular spin qubits.

Title: Hydrazine-Free Precursor for Solution-Processed All-Inorganic Se and Se1-xTex Photovoltaics
Authors: Adam D. Alfieri, Swarnendu Das, Kim Kisslinger, Chloe Leblanc, Jamie Ford, Cherie R. Kagan, Eric A. Stach, Deep Jariwala
Abstract: Selenium (Se) has reemerged as a promising absorber material for indoor and tandem photovoltaics (PVs), and its alloys with Te (Se1-xTex) offer a widely tunable bandgap. Solution processing of this materials system offers a route to low-cost fabrication. However, solution processing of Se has, thus far, only used hydrazine, which is an extremely hazardous solvent. In this work, we prepare and isolate propylammonium poly-Se and poly-Se-Te precursors from a safer thiol-amine solvent system. We formulate molecular inks by dissolving the precursor n,n-dimethylformamide (DMF) with a monoethanolamine (EA) additive and process high-quality Se and Se1-xTex films with bandgaps ranging from 1.20 eV to 1.86 eV. We fabricate PVs from these films using TiO2 and MoO3 charge transport layers (CTLs) to achieve power conversion efficiencies as high as 2.73% for Se and 2.33% for Se0.7Te0.3 under solar simulation. Se devices show excellent stability with no degradation after 1 month in air, enabled by the excellent stability of Se and the use of inorganic CTLs. This work represents an important step towards low-cost solution-phase processing of Se and Se1-xTex alloys for PVs and photodetectors with low toxicity and high bandgap tunability.

Title: Field-Tailoring Quantum Materials: Magneto-Synthesis of Metastable Metallic States in a Spin-Orbit-Coupled Trimer Iridate
Authors: Tristan R. Cao, Hengdi Zhao, Xudong Huai, Arabella Quane, Varun Narayanan, Thao T. Tran, Feng Ye, Gang Cao
Abstract: We demonstrate that modest magnetic fields (a fraction of a Tesls), when applied during high-temperature crystal growth, can profoundly alter the structural and electronic ground state of a spin-orbit-coupled, antiferromagnetic trimer lattice. Using an iridate as a model system, we show that magneto-synthesis, a field-assisted synthesis approach, stabilizes a structurally compressed, metastable metallic phase that cannot be accessed through conventional synthesis routes. This field-tailored phase exhibits a shortened Ir-Ir bond distance, reduced lattice distortion, and suppressed magnetic order, culminating in a robust insulator-to-metal transition. Electrical resistivity of the field-tailored phase drops by up to four orders of magnitude, while the low-temperature specific heat reveals a substantial enhancement in the Sommerfeld coefficient, consistent with the emergence of a highly correlated metallic state. First-principles calculations confirm that the field-stabilized phase lies significantly above the ground state in energy, underscoring its metastable nature. These findings establish magneto-synthesis as a powerful new pathway for accessing non-equilibrium quantum phases in strongly correlated materials.

Title: g-Factor Enhanced Upper Critical Field in Superconducting PdTe2 due to Quantum Confinement

Abstract: The Pauli limiting field of superconductors determines the maximal possible value of magnetic field at which superconductivity remains possible. For weak-coupling superconductors, it is determined by an established relation that can be found by setting the condensation energy equal to the magnetization free energy. The latter is a function of the carrier g-factor. Here, we demonstrate in a van der Waals superconductor PdTe2, that quantum confinement can tune the effective g-factor causing the Pauli limit to become thickness dependent. We experimentally probe the in-plane upper critical field (Hc2||) of PdTe2 at intermediate thicknesses down to 20mK. Hc2|| is enhanced by more than an order of magnitude as the thickness is varied from 50nm down to 19nm. We model its temperature and thickness dependence, revealing that both orbital and spin Zeeman depairing mechanisms impact its value. While the variation of the orbital interaction is expected, our findings reveal how the Zeeman interaction impacts superconductivity in thin films. They aid in the search for mixed and odd pairing superconductivity where an enhancement of Hc2|| can be occasionally associated with those unconventional pairing symmetries.

Title: Field-derivative torque induced magnetization reversal in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$
Authors: Pratyay Mukherjee, Arpita Dutta, Somasree Bhattacharjee, Shovon Pal, Ritwik Mondal
Abstract: Understanding the mechanism of spin switching in ferrimagnets via the excitation of THz pulses holds promise for future-generation magnetic memory devices. Such spin switching can be accomplished by the Zeeman torque exerted by the THz pulses on the magnetic spins. Theoretical and experimental works have established that the field-derivative of a terahertz pulse also exerts a torque, field derivative torque (FDT). Here, we investigate the role of the FDT in the spin switching in ferrimagnetic Gd$_{3/2}$Yb$_{1/2}$BiFe$_5$O$_{12}$ using a computational approach. Our results foresee that the spin switching in the presence of the FDT requires less THz magnetic fields than the spin switching without the FDT. Without the FDT terms, the spin switching in the considered system requires an extremely high magnetic field. Furthermore, we compute the switching and non-switching contour diagrams to show that the FDT tremendously enhances the possibility of spin switching. These results not only shed light on the significance of the FDT in magnetization switching but also suggest materials where the switching effect is pronounced.

Title: Tunable Interfacial Thermal Conductance in Graphene/Germanene van der Waals Heterostructure using an Optimized Interlayer Potential
Authors: Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sourav Thapliyal, Bheema Lingam Chittari, Santosh Mogurampelly
Abstract: Accurately modeling interfacial thermal transport in van der Waals heterostructures is challenging due to the limited availability of interlayer interaction potentials. We develop a pairwise interlayer potential for graphene/germanene van der Waals heterostructure using the binding energy obtained from ab-initio density functional theory calculations and use it to calculate the interfacial thermal conductivity. Our calculations reveal that the interfacial thermal conductivity shows superior tunability with external strain. The phonon density of states calculations show a blueshift in the phonon spectra with an applied compressive strain in the direction of heat flow, increasing the interfacial thermal conductance to $\sim$136% of the unstrained value. In contrast, a tensile strain is found to cause an opposite effect, reducing the conductance to $\sim$70% of the unstrained value. Moreover, due to increased availability of phonons for heat transfer, both temperature and interaction strength are found to correlate positively with the interfacial thermal conductance for both directions of heat flow.

Title: Magnetic and Crystal Symmetry Effects on Spin Hall Conductivity in Altermagnets
Authors: Dameul Jeong, Seoung-Hun Kang, Young-Kyun Kwon
Abstract: Altermagnets, which reconcile zero net magnetization with pronounced spin splitting, offer fresh opportunities for spin-based functionalities in next-generation electronic and spintronic devices. In this paper, we explore the unconventional spin Hall conductivity (USHC) in three prototypical altermagnets -- RuO$_2$, CrSb, and MnTe -- and elucidate how distinct magnetic and crystal symmetries modulate their spin Hall responses. RuO$_2$ exhibits only trivial USHC contributions under a tilted geometry, demonstrating that symmetry projections alone can induce apparent unconventional elements. In contrast, CrSb and MnTe manifest robust, symmetry-driven USHC without structural tilts, enabled by easy-axis orientations that reduce magnetic symmetry. Through extensive first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the complementary roles of the time-reversal-even and time-reversal-odd components in determining the overall SHC. Our findings indicate that controlling the interplay between crystal and magnetic symmetry -- for instance, by epitaxial strain or doping -- can provide an experimental avenue to tune USHC magnitudes and directions in altermagnets. These results pave the way for the engineering of multifunctional spintronic devices, where enhanced coherence and robust spin transport are realized in zero-net-moment materials with easily tailored spin configurations.

Title: Effect of Josephson junction parameter spread on the performance of SQUID arrays
Authors: O. A. Nieves, M. A. Galí Labarias, A. C. Keser, K.-H Müller, E. E. Mitchell
Abstract: Josephson junctions based on grain boundaries, such as those made of Yttrium Barium Copper Oxide (YBCO), exhibit inherent parameter spreads in their critical current and normal state resistance. This variation in junction properties leads to a decrease in array performance for magnetic sensing applications. Therefore, we must develop a quantitative understanding of how junction parameter spreads impact arrays with different designs. In this paper, we use numerical simulations to investigate how the ensemble averaged voltage modulation depth (eta) of one-dimensional SQUID arrays varies with the statistical spread in the junction parameters. In these calculations for arrays we vary the number of junctions, loop inductance and thermal noise strength. We show that eta decreases with increasing spread, and that this reduction is accelerated further by the number of junctions and SQUID cell inductance, but is robust to changes in the thermal noise strength.

Title: Proximate spin-liquid behavior in the double trillium lattice antiferromagnet K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$
Authors: A. Magar, K. Somesh, M. P. Saravanan, J. Sichelschmidt, Y. Skourski, M. T. F. Telling, V. A. Ginga, A. A. Tsirlin, R. Nath
Abstract: We report proximate quantum spin liquid behavior in K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ with the magnetic Co$^{2+}$ ions embedded on a highly frustrated three-dimensional double trillium lattice. Single-crystal and high-resolution synchrotron powder x-ray diffraction experiments reveal a structural phase transition at $T_{\rm t} \simeq 125$ K from high-temperature cubic to low-temperature monoclinic phase with the three-fold superstructure. Magnetization and heat capacity consistently show the formation of the $J_{\rm eff} =1/2$ state of Co$^{2+}$ below 50 K. In zero field, K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ shows signatures of static magnetic order formed below $T^* \simeq 0.6$ K, but muon spin relaxation experiments reveal a large fluctuating component that persists down to at least 50 mK, reminiscent of quantum spin liquid (QSL). Static order is completely suppressed in the small magnetic field of $\sim 1$ T, and low-temperature heat capacity demonstrates the $T^2$ behavior above this field, another fingerprint of QSL. Ab initio calculations show a competition of several antiferromagnetic couplings that render K$_2$Co$_2$(SO$_4$)$_3$ a promising pseudospin-$\frac12$ material for studying quantum magnetism in the double trillium lattice geometry.

Title: Breakdown and polarization contrasts in ferroelectric devices observed by operando laser-based photoemission electron microscopy with the AC/DC electrical characterization system
Authors: Hirokazu Fujiwara, Yuki Itoya, Masaharu Kobayashi, Cédric Bareille, Toshiyuki Taniuchi
Abstract: We have developed an operando laser-based photoemission electron microscope (laser-PEEM) with a ferroelectric characterization system. A Sawyer-Tower circuit was implemented to measure the polarization-voltage ($P-V$) characteristics of ferroelectric devices. Using this system, we successfully obtained the well-defined $P-V$ hysteresis loops for a ferroelectric capacitor incorporating Hf$_{0.5}$Zr$_{0.5}$O$_2$ (HZO), reproducing the typical field-cycling characteristics of HZO capacitors. After dielectric breakdown caused by field-cycling stress, we visualized a conduction filament through the top electrode without any destructive processing. Additionally, we successfully observed polarization contrast through the top electrode of an oxide semiconductor (InZnO$_x$). These results indicate that our operando laser-PEEM system is a powerful tool for visualizing conduction filaments after dielectric breakdown, the ferroelectric polarization contrasts, and electronic state distribution of materials implemented in ferroelectric devices, including ferroelectric field-effect transistors and ferroelectric tunnel junctions.

Title: Doping $S=1$ antiferromagnet in one-dimension
Authors: J. Prokopczyk, J. Herbrych
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic ground states, when doped, give rise to rich and complex phenomena, prompting detailed investigations in various spin systems. Here, we study the effect of doping on the one-dimensional $S = 1$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model (AFM). Specifically, we investigate how the presence of holes affects the static and dynamic (frequency-dependent) spin-spin correlations of the two-orbital Hubbard-Kanamori chain. The latter, at half-filling and in the limit of strong interactions, maps onto an $S = 1$ Heisenberg model. For moderate interactions, an orbital resonating-valence-bond (orbital-RVB) state emerges up to doping levels of $x \lesssim 0.4$. A detailed analysis of interaction strength $U$ and doping concentration $x$ reveals that this phase inherits the key features of spin excitations found in the half-filled case -- namely, a gapped spin spectrum and ``coherent'' magnon behavior up to a wavevector $q$ determined by the Fermi vector, $2k_\mathrm{F} = \pi(1 - x)$. Furthermore, our results uncover an additional broad, incoherent spectral weight for $q \gtrsim 2k_\mathrm{F}$ at high frequencies. Finally, we show that near the transition to a ferromagnetic phase, a previously unidentified spiral-like state emerges, characterized by spin excitations reminiscent of the $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model.

Title: Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene
Authors: Yu.V. Shtanov, T.-H.O. Pokalchuk, S.G. Sharapov
Abstract: We investigate the Sagnac and Mashhoon effects in graphene, taking into account both the pseudospin and intrinsic spin of electrons, within a simplified model of a rotating nanotube or infinitesimally narrow ring. Based on considerations of the relativistic phase of the wave function and employing the effective Larmor theorem, we demonstrate that the Sagnac fringe shift retains a form analogous to that for free electrons, governed by the electron's vacuum mass. In the case of a narrow ring, an additional $\pi$-phase shift arises due to the Berry phase associated with the honeycomb graphene lattice. The Mashhoon fringe shift, which characterizes the dynamics of intrinsic spin, retains its conventional form in graphene, with its dependence on the Fermi velocity. Our analysis highlights both the similarities and differences between spin and pseudospin degrees of freedom in graphene.

Title: Anisotropy at twin interfaces in $RT_{12}$ ($R$=rare earth, $T$=transition metal) magnets
Authors: Christopher E Patrick
Abstract: RT\textsubscript{12} materials continue to attract attention due to their potential use as ``rare-earth-lean'' permanent magnets, but converting their promising intrinsic properties into practical high performance remains an elusive goal. Sophisticated experimental characterization techniques are providing unprecedented insight into the structure of these materials at the atomistic scale. Atomistic spin dynamics or micromagnetics simulations could help unravel the links between these structures and resultant magnet performance, but require input data describing the intrinsic magnetic properties. Here, first-principles calculations based on density-functional theory are used to determine these properties for two model interface structures which have been derived from recently reported high resolution electron microscopy images. One model structure is a stoichiometric twin formed by mirroring the RT\textsubscript{12} structure in the (101) plane, and the other model structure is a ``stacking fault'' involving the insertion of a RT\textsubscript{4} plane and a displacement along the [100] axis. Magnetic moments and crystal field coefficients have been calculated for the optimized structures. The interfaces modify the magnetic properties at the sub-nm scale. In particular, in the R-rich region of the ``stacking fault'', the local easy axis of magnetization rotates by $49^\circ$ from its bulk direction, which may lead to reduced coercivity through the easier nucleation of reverse domains.

Title: Revisiting the access conductance of a charged nanopore membrane
Authors: Holly C. M. Baldock, David M. Huang
Abstract: Electric-field-driven electrolyte transport through nanoporous membranes is important for applications including osmotic power generation, sensing and iontronics. We derive an analytical equation in the Debye--Hückel regime and a semi-analytical equation for arbitrary surface potentials for the electric-field-driven electric current through a pore in an ultrathin membrane, which predict scaling with fractional powers of the pore size and Debye length. We show that our theory for arbitrary electric potentials accurately quantifies the ionic conductance through an ultrathin membrane in finite-element method numerical simulations for a wide range of parameters, and generalizes a widely used theory for the access electrical conductance of a membrane nanopore to a broader range of conditions. Our theory predicts that fractional scaling of the ionic conductance with electrolyte concentration at low concentrations is a general property of charged ultrathin membranes and also occurs for thicker membranes for which the access contribution to the conductance dominates, which could explain experimental observations of this widely debated phenomenon.

Title: Mechanistic Insight into BEOL Thermal Transport via Optical Metrology and Multiphysics Simulation
Authors: Yang Shen, Shangzhi Song, Tao Chen, Kexin Zhang, Yu Chen, Lu Zhao, Puqing Jiang
Abstract: As integrated circuits continue to scale down and adopt three-dimensional (3D) stacking, thermal management in the back-end-of-line (BEOL) has emerged as a critical design constraint. In this study, we present a combined experimental and simulation framework to quantitatively characterize and mechanistically understand thermal transport in BEOL multilayers. Using the Square-Pulsed Source (SPS) method, a time-resolved optical metrology technique, we measure cross-plane thermal resistance and areal heat capacity in semiconductor chips at nanometer resolution. Two fabricated chip samples, polished to the M4 and M6 interconnection layers, are analyzed to extract thermal properties of distinct multilayer stacks. Results show that thermal resistance follows a series model, while areal heat capacity scales linearly with metal content. To uncover the underlying physical mechanisms, we perform finite element simulations using COMSOL Multiphysics, examining the influence of via connectivity and dielectric thermal conductivity on effective cross-plane heat transport. The simulations reveal that dielectric materials, due to their large volume fraction, are the primary limiting factor in BEOL thermal conduction, while the via structure plays a secondary but significant role. This combined experimental-simulation approach provides mechanistic insight into heat transport in advanced IC architectures and offers practical guidance for optimizing thermal pathways in future high-performance 3D-stacked devices.

Title: QVNTVS, Open-Source Quantum Well Simulator
Authors: Barbaros Şair
Abstract: Quantum Wells (QW) are of great importance in optoelectronic devices such as LEDs and LASERs, being the emissive this http URL the quantum particles in different QW topologies like rectangular finite potential wells, multiple potential wells, and triangular biased potential well heterojunctions enables faster modeling, theoretical characterization, and more. QVNTVS performs energy level and wavefunction calculations, recombination probability, transition energy, and optical emission computations quickly and accurately. Contrasting with the existing simulators, QVNTVS is an open-source project and can produce solutions for niche problems like potential wells under an electric field, heterojunctions, recombination, and transition matrices. QVNTVS simulates QWs by solving the Time-Independent Schrödinger Equation for different potential profiles in a discretized space using the finite-difference method and computes the properties of the device using the extracted information from the solution. The results align with the analytical calculations and the experimental data.

Title: Generative Inversion for Property-Targeted Materials Design: Application to Shape Memory Alloys
Authors: Cheng Li, Pengfei Danga, Yuehui Xiana, Yumei Zhou, Bofeng Shi, Xiangdong Ding, Jun Suna, Dezhen Xue
Abstract: The design of shape memory alloys (SMAs) with high transformation temperatures and large mechanical work output remains a longstanding challenge in functional materials engineering. Here, we introduce a data-driven framework based on generative adversarial network (GAN) inversion for the inverse design of high-performance SMAs. By coupling a pretrained GAN with a property prediction model, we perform gradient-based latent space optimization to directly generate candidate alloy compositions and processing parameters that satisfy user-defined property targets. The framework is experimentally validated through the synthesis and characterization of five NiTi-based SMAs. Among them, the Ni$_{49.8}$Ti$_{26.4}$Hf$_{18.6}$Zr$_{5.2}$ alloy achieves a high transformation temperature of 404 $^\circ$C, a large mechanical work output of 9.9 J/cm$^3$, a transformation enthalpy of 43 J/g , and a thermal hysteresis of 29 °C, outperforming existing NiTi alloys. The enhanced performance is attributed to a pronounced transformation volume change and a finely dispersed of Ti$_2$Ni-type precipitates, enabled by sluggish Zr and Hf diffusion, and semi-coherent interfaces with localized strain fields. This study demonstrates that GAN inversion offers an efficient and generalizable route for the property-targeted discovery of complex alloys.

Title: Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov States and Topological Bogoliubov Fermi Surfaces in Altermagnets: an Analytical Study
Authors: Zhao Liu, Hui Hu, Xia-ji Liu
Abstract: We present an analytical study of the ground-state phase diagram for dilute two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi gases exhibiting $d$-wave altermagnetic spin splitting under $s$-wave pairing. Within the Bogoliubov-de Gennes mean-field framework, four distinct phases are identified: a Bardeen-Schrieffer-Cooper-type superfluid, a normal metallic phase, a nodal superfluid with topological Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces (TBFSs), and Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) states with finite center-of-mass momentum. Among these, the FFLO states and TBFSs exemplify two unconventional forms of superconductivity. Considering the simplicity of this model, with only one band, zero net magnetization, and $s$-wave paring, the emergence of both unconventional phases underscores the pivotal role of altermagnetic spin splitting in enabling exotic pairing phenomena. This analytical study not only offers a valuable benchmark for future numerical simulations, but also provides a concrete experimental roadmap for realizing FFLO states and TBFSs in altermagnets.

Title: Condensed Spin Excitation of Quantized Dirac Fermions in the Quasi-Two-Dimensional semimetal BaMnBi$_2$
Authors: Masashi Kumazaki, Azimjon Temurjonov, Yukihiro Watanabe, Taku Matsuhita, Yoshiaki Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Shimizu
Abstract: Three-dimensional Dirac semimetals enable the observation of bulk magnetism in topological quantum phases. We report site-selective NMR spectroscopy that probes local static and dynamic spin susceptibility on the magnetic semimetal BaMnBi$_2$. We find that spontaneous staggered fields from antiferromagnetic Mn moments are completely canceled at the Bi layer hosting Dirac fermions. In an in-plane field, the nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate $1/T_1$ follows the cubic temperature dependence to low temperatures, manifesting the ideal Dirac semimetal with chemical potential close to the Dirac point. In an out-of-plane field, $1/T_1$ becomes a constant below 20 K, where the Laudau level appears, and is enhanced more than 100 times larger than under the in-plane field. The result demonstrates a condensation of quantized Dirac fermions in the quantum Hall regime.

Title: Sokoban Random Walk: From Environment Reshaping to Trapping Transition
Authors: Prashant Singh, David A. Kessler, Eli Barkai
Abstract: We study the dynamics of a $\textit{Sokoban random walker}$ moving in a disordered medium with obstacle density $\rho$. In contrast to the classic model of de Gennes with static obstacles that exhibits a percolation transition, the Sokoban walker is capable of modifying its environment by pushing a few surrounding obstacles. Surprisingly, even a limited pushing ability leads to a loss of the percolation transition. Through a combination of a rigorous large-deviation calculation and extensive numerical simulations, we demonstrate that the Sokoban model belongs to the Balagurov-Vaks-Donsker-Varadhan trapping universality class. The survival probability that the walker has not yet been trapped inside a cage exhibits stretched-exponential relaxation at late times. Furthermore, using the average trap size as a proxy, we identify a new trapping transition that replaces the classical percolation transition. This transition occurs at a threshold density $\rho_* \approx 0.55$ and separates two qualitatively distinct trapping regimes: a self-trapping regime at low density, where the walker becomes dynamically localized within a self-formed trap, and a pre-existing trapping regime at high density, where confinement arises from the initial arrangement of obstacles.

Title: Impact of Ce Substitution on Structural and Electrochemical Properties of Ga Doped Garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 Solid Electrolyte
Authors: Muktai Aote, A. V. Deshpande, Vaibhav Sirsulwar, Priya Padaganur, Neha, Abhishek Pradhan
Abstract: In order to replace conventional liquid electrolytes, solid electrolyte should possess high ionic conductivity. In this study, the effects of Ga-Ce co-doping on the garnet Li7La3Zr2O12 solid electrolyte have been investigated. The series Li6.4Ga0.2La3Zr2-xCexO12 has been prepared with varying content of Ce from 0 to 0.30 atoms per formula unit (a.p.f.u.) by sintering at 1050^0C. Various structural characterizations namely X-diffraction, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), density measurements were carried out. The electrochemical analysis suggested that, the sample with 0.10 a.p.f.u. of Ce offered the highest room temperature ionic conductivity of 4 x 10-4 S/cm with the minimum activation energy of 0.29 eV. Moreover, DC conductivity measurement proved the predominant ionic conduction in the prepared samples making it suitable for the application in all solid state Li-ion batteries (ASSLIBs).

Title: Multiple Adsorption of CO Molecules on Transition Metal Substitutional Impurities in Copper Surfaces
Authors: Magnus A. H. Christiansen, Wei Wang, Elvar Ö. Jónsson, Giancarlo Cicero, Hannes Jónsson
Abstract: Copper-based catalysts are of particular interest for electrochemical reduction of CO$_2$ (CO2RR) as products beyond CO can form. To improve activity and selectivity, several studies have focused on the addition of other elements as substitutional impurities. Although the adsorption of a single CO molecule has often been used as a descriptor for CO2RR activity, our recent calculations using the RPBE functional showed that multiple CO molecules can bind to first-row transition metal impurities. Here, we extend the study to second-row transition metals and also to a functional that explicitly includes dispersion interaction, BEEF-vdW. The binding energy of the first CO molecule on the impurity atom is found to be significantly larger than on the clean Cu(111) and Cu(100) surfaces, but the differential binding energy generally drops as more CO molecules adsorb. The dispersion interaction is found to make a significant contribution to the binding energy, in particular for the last and weakest bound CO molecule, the one that is most likely to participate in CO2RR. In some cases, four CO admolecules can bind more strongly on the impurity atom than on the clean copper surface. The adsorption of CO causes the position of the impurity atom to shift outwards and in some cases, even escape from the surface layer. The C-O stretch frequencies are calculated in order to identify possible experimental signatures of multiple CO adsorption.

Title: Competition between mirror symmetry breaking and translation symmetry breaking in ferroelectric liquid crystals with increasing lateral substitution
Authors: Grant J. Strachan, Ewa Górecka, Damian Pociecha
Abstract: The recently discovered heliconical ferroelectric nematic (NTBF) phase is a unique example of spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a proper ferroelectric fluid. In this study, we investigate four homologous series of mesogenic compounds, differing in the degree of fluorination of the mesogenic core and bearing lateral alkoxy substituents of varying lengths, to understand how molecular architecture influences the formation and stability of the NTBF phase. Increasing the length of the lateral chain lowers the phase transition temperatures and suppresses smectic layer formation, enabling the emergence of the NTBF phase which replaces the orthogonal ferroelectric smectic A (SmAF) phase. This indicates a competition between lamellar and heliconical polar ordering, driven by the interplay of strong molecular dipoles and the self-segregation of chemically incompatible molecular segments that typically favor layered structures. Notably, the NTBF phase in these compounds exhibits exceptionally short helical pitch lengths, on the order of a few hundred nanometers, as revealed by selective light reflection and atomic force microscopy (AFM). Furthermore, for one of the studied compounds AFM imaging of one compound revealed a regular array of screw dislocations within the NTBF phase, suggesting a possible link to more complex modulated or twist-grain-boundary-like structures.

Title: Optimizing the depth-dependent nitrogen-vacancy center quantum sensor in diamane
Authors: Pei Li, Guanjian Hu, Xiao Yu, Bing Huang, Song Li
Abstract: Negatively charged nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is the representative solid state defect qubit for quantum information science, offering long coherence time at room temperature. To achieve high sensitivity and spatial resolution, shallow NV center near the surface are preferred. However, shallow NV center suffers from surface states and spin noise which reduce the photostability and coherence time. In this work, we systematically study the NV center in recently reported two-dimensional diamond, known as diamane--using first-principles calculations. We show that the quantum confinement in finite-layer diamane, with appropriate surface passivation, could significantly modify the band structure. In particular, we identify oxygen surface termination capable of hosting NV center in diamane while optimizing photostability compared to bulk diamond. Furthermore, layer-dependent NV center demonstrates tunable zero-phonon-line and suppressed phonon side band, while retaining long coherence time. Our findings highlight diamane as a promising platform for NV-based quantum information processing with improved optical properties and stability

Title: Gate tunable spin-charge interconversion in a graphene/ReS$_{2}$ heterostructure up to room temperature
Authors: Eoin Dolan, Zhendong Chi, Haozhe Yang, Luis E. Hueso, Fèlix Casanova
Abstract: Graphene is a material with great potential in the field of spintronics, combining good conductivity with low spin--orbit coupling (SOC), which allows for the transport of spin currents over long distances. However, this lack of SOC also limits the capacity for manipulating spin current. A key strategy to address this limitation is to induce SOC in graphene via proximity to other two-dimensional (2D) materials. Such proximity-induced SOC can enable spin--charge interconversion (SCI) in graphene, with potential applications in next-generation logic devices. Here, we place graphene in close proximity to the room-temperature ferroelectric candidate ReS$_\mathrm{2}$, inducing SCI for both in-plane and out-of-plane polarized spin current. We attribute the SCI for in-plane polarized current to either the Rashba--Edelstein effect (REE) or the unconventional spin Hall effect (SHE) at the graphene/ReS$_\mathrm{2}$ interface, and the SCI for out-of-plane polarized current to either the conventional SHE in the proximitised graphene, or the unconventional SHE in the bulk of the ReS$_\mathrm{2}$. SCI due to in-plane spin is characterised over a wide range of temperature, up to 300 K and a range of gate voltages.

Title: Rabi Oscillations Modulated Noise Squeezing in Active Quantum Dot Ensembles
Authors: Ori Gabai, Amnon Willinger, Igor Khanonkin, Vitalii Sichkovskyi, Johann Peter Reithmaier, Gadi Eisenstein
Abstract: Generation of squeezed light is usually implemented in nonlinear \c{hi}(2) or \c{hi}(3) materials. Semiconductor lasers and optical amplifiers (SOAs) also offer non-linearities but they differ from passive elements in that they add amplified spontaneous emission noise (ASE). In a semiconductor laser, squeezing to below the shot noise limit has been demonstrated. An SOA contains no cavity and it adds significant noise. Gain saturation can lead, in principle, to squeezing of the photon number quadrature to below the shot noise level but often the noise is reduced only to below the ASE level of a linear amplifier. At the same time, the noise in the phase quadrature increases according to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. Short resonant pulses interacting with a quantum dot SOA induce coherent effects such as Rabi oscillations. Here, we demonstrate, for the first time, that Rabi oscillations cause cyclical noise squeezing which varies periodically with the excitation pulse area. The noise in the present experiments does not reach the quantum limit so we term this condition quasi squeezing. It occurs during the portions of the Rabi cycle when the quantum dots provide gain and repeats with every fourfold increase of the pulse excitation energy which amounts to a 2{\pi} increase in pulse area. In all other cases, the noise exhibits the properties of a coherent state.

Title: Generalized Cutler-Mott relation in a two-site charge Kondo simulator
Authors: T. K. T. Nguyen, M. N. Kiselev
Abstract: We analyze the validity of the Cutler-Mott relations outside the Landau Fermi-liquid concept. We consider a two-site charge Kondo circuit as a paradigmatic example of a system possessing both Fermi- and non-Fermi liquid properties. It is shown that the generalized Cutler-Mott-like relations derived in the paper hold in both operating regimes of the charge Kondo quantum circuit describing a smooth crossover between low- and high- temperature regimes. We discuss applicability of the generalized Cutler-Mott relations for computing a figure of merit of the non-Fermi liquid quantum simulators.

Authors: Nolan Lassaline, Camilla H. Sørensen, Giulia Meucci, Sander J. Linde, Kian Latifi Yaghin, Tuan K. Chau, Damon J. Carrad, Peter Bøggild, Thomas S. Jespersen, Timothy J. Booth
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) provide a versatile platform for quantum electronics. Experiments generally require encapsulating graphene within hBN flakes, forming a protective van der Waals (vdW) heterostructure that preserves delicate properties of the embedded crystal. To produce functional devices, heterostructures are typically shaped by electron beam lithography and etching, which has driven progress in 2D materials research. However, patterns are primarily restricted to in-plane geometries such as boxes, holes, and stripes, limiting opportunities for advanced architectures. Here, we use thermal scanning-probe lithography (tSPL) to produce smooth topographic landscapes in vdW heterostructures, controlling the thickness degree of freedom with nanometer precision. We electrically gate a sinusoidal topography to impose an electric-field gradient on the graphene layer to spatially modulate charge-carrier doping. We observe signatures of the landscape in transport measurements-resistance-peak spreading and commensurability oscillations-establishing tSPL for tailoring high-quality quantum electronics.

Title: On Noise-Sensitive Automatic Tuning of Gate-Defined Sensor Dots
Authors: Fabian Hader, Jan Vogelbruch, Simon Humpohl, Tobias Hangleiter, Chimezie Eguzo, Stefan Heinen, Stefanie Meyer, Stefan van Waasen
Abstract: In gate-defined quantum dot systems, the conductance change of electrostatically coupled sensor dots allows the observation of the quantum dots' charge and spin states. Therefore, the sensor dot must be optimally sensitive to changes in its electrostatic environment. A series of conductance measurements varying the two sensor-dot-forming barrier gate voltages serve to tune the dot into a corresponding operating regime. In this paper, we analyze the noise characteristics of the measured data and define a criterion to identify continuous regions with a sufficient signal-gradient-to-noise ratio. Hence, accurate noise estimation is required when identifying the optimal operating regime. Therefore, we evaluate several existing noise estimators, modify them for 1D data, optimize their parameters, and analyze their quality based on simulated data. The estimator of Chen et al. turns out to be best suited for our application concerning minimally scattering results. Furthermore, using this estimator in an algorithm for flank-of-interest classification in measured data shows the relevance and applicability of our approach.

Title: Optical Measurement of Mass Density of Biological Samples
Authors: Conrad Möckel, Jiarui Li, Giulia Zanini, Jochen Guck, Giuliano Scarcelli
Abstract: Mass density is a vital property for improved biophysical understanding of and within biological samples. It is increasingly attracting active investigation, but still lacks reliable, non-contact techniques to accurately characterize it in biological systems. Contrary to popular belief, refractive index information alone is insufficient to determine a sample's mass density, as we demonstrate here theoretically and experimentally. Instead, we measured the nonlinear gain of stimulated Brillouin scattering to provide additional information for mass density estimation. This all-optical method reduces the estimation error tenfold, offering a more accurate and universal technique for mass density measurements.

Title: Cr resonant impurity for studies of band inversion and band offsets in IV-VI semiconductors

Abstract: Understanding the electronic structure of transition-metal dopants in IV-VI semiconductors is critical for tuning their band structure. We analyze properties of Cr dopant in $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ and PbSe by magnetic and transport measurements, which are interpreted based on density functional calculations. We demonstrate that the pinning of the Fermi energy to the chromium resonant level occurs for both n-type and p-type $Pb_{1-x}Sn_xTe$ in the whole composition range. This enables us to determine the valence band and conduction band offsets at the PbTe/SnTe/PbSe heterointerfaces, which is important for designing high-prformance 2D transistors. Furthermore, the magnetic measurements reveal the presence of Cr ions in three charge states, $Cr^{3+}$, $Cr^{2+}$, and $Cr^{1+}$. The last one corresponds to the Cr dopants incorporated at the interstitial, and not the substitutional, sites. The measured concentrations of the interstitial and substitutional Cr are comparable.

Title: Sliding Ferroelectric Metal with Ferrimagnetism
Authors: Zhenzhou Guo, Xiaodong Zhou, Wenhong Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng, Xiaotian Wang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) sliding ferroelectric (FE) metals with ferrimagnetism represent a previously unexplored class of spintronic materials, where the interplay of ferroelectricity, metallicity, and magnetism enables strong magnetoelectric (ME) coupling and electrically tunable spintronic functionalities. Here, based on antiferromagnetic (AFM) metallic bilayers, we propose a general strategy for constructing 2D sliding FE ferrimagnetic (FiM) metals that can achieve tri-state switching, in which the FE polarization, spin splitting, and net magnetization are reversed simultaneously through FE switching. As a prototypical realization, we design a bilayer sliding FE metal with FiM order, derived from monolayer Fe5GeTe2-a van der Waals metal with intrinsic magnetic order close to room temperature. The system exhibits a FE transition from a nonpolar (NP) AFM phase to a FE FiM phase via interlayer sliding. The in-plane mirror symmetry breaking in FE metallic states lift the spin degeneracy that exists in the NP phase, leading to a sizable net magnetic moment and strong linear ME coupling. The interplay between metallicity and FE FiM gives rise to pronounced sign-reversible transport responses near the Fermi level, all of which can be fully electrically controlled by FE switching without reorienting the Néel order. Our results establish sliding FE metals with FiM as a promising platform for electrically reconfigurable, high-speed, and low-dissipation spintronic devices.

Title: Drag Coefficient in Near-Critical Binary Mixtures: Solving Hydrodynamic Fields with Improved Numerics
Authors: Shunsuke Yabunaka
Abstract: We calculate the drag coefficient of a spherical particle suspended in a near-critical binary fluid mixture. To capture the scaling behavior associated with critical adsorption in the strong adsorption regime, we employ the framework of local renormalized functional theory. Previous theoretical studies encountered numerical difficulties when attempting to solve the coupled hydrodynamic and chemical potential equations, expressed as integral equations, for systems with large bulk correlation lengths. These difficulties limited direct comparison with experimental results. In this study, we overcome those limitations by reformulating the hydrodynamic equations as a set of ordinary differential equations using a compactified radial coordinate. This approach enables more stable numerical computation and facilitates the implementation of appropriate boundary conditions at large distances from the particle. As a result, we successfully compute the drag coefficient over a broader range of bulk correlation lengths than in previous works and compare our theoretical predictions with available experimental data.

Title: Extreme anharmonicity and thermal contraction of 1D wires
Authors: Chiara Cignarella, Lorenzo Bastonero, Lorenzo Monacelli, Nicola Marzari
Abstract: Ultrathin nanowires could play a central role in next-generation downscaled electronics. Here, we explore some of the most promising candidates identified from previous high-throughput screening: CuC$_2$, TaSe$_3$, and AuSe$_2$, to gain insight into the thermodynamic and anharmonic behaviors of nanowires that could be exfoliated from weakly-bonded three-dimensional materials. We analyze thermal stability, linear thermal expansion, and anharmonic heat capacity using the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation. Notably, our work unveils exotic features common among all the 1D wires: a colossal record negative thermal expansion and very large deviations from the Dulong-Petit law due to strong anharmonicity.

Title: Cu2OSeO3 Turns Trigonal with Structural Transformation and Implications for Skyrmions
Authors: Alla Arakcheeva, Priya Ranjan Baral, Wen Hua Bi, Christian Jandl, Oleg Janson, Arnaud Magrez
Abstract: The formation and characteristics of magnetic skyrmions are strongly governed by the symmetry of the underlying crystal structure. In this study, we report the discovery of a new trigonal polymorph of Cu2OSeO3, observed exclusively in nanoparticles. Electron diffraction and density functional theory calculations confirm its R3m space group, sharing C3v symmetry with Néel-type skyrmion hosts. This polymorph is likely stabilized by surface effects, suggesting that size-induced structural changes may drive a transformation from Bloch-type to Neel-type skyrmions in Cu2OSeO3. This hypothesis is consistent with prior unexplained observations of Neel-type skyrmions at the surfaces of bulk crystals, which may result from surface-specific structural distortions. Overall, these findings provide insights into the interplay between size, structure, and magnetism, opening pathways for controlling skyrmionic properties in nanoscale systems.

Abstract: Here we report the observation of time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking superconductivity in a BiNi bilayer using terahertz (THz) polarimetry. Leveraging a novel high-precision THz polarimetry technique, we detect, in the superconducting state and at zero magnetic field, the smallest polarization rotation of THz light measured to date. By using the MgO substrate itself as an optical resonator, we can reference the Faraday and Kerr rotations to each other. We observe a low-frequency Kerr rotation on the order of several hundred microradians in the superconducting phase, a clear signature consistent with TRS-breaking superconductivity. Our measurements enable direct access to the THz-range Hall conductivity. Through a Kramers-Kronig analysis, we link these low-energy measurements to prior high-frequency magneto-optic Kerr effect (MOKE) data. This connection provides critical insight into the nature of the TRS-breaking state, supporting a multiband superconducting scenario over a disordered single-band interpretation for the origin of the Kerr effect.

Title: Simulation of Charge Stability Diagrams for Automated Tuning Solutions (SimCATS)
Authors: Fabian Hader, Sarah Fleitmann, Jan Vogelbruch, Lotte Geck, Stefan van Waasen
Abstract: Quantum dots must be tuned precisely to provide a suitable basis for quantum computation. A scalable platform for quantum computing can only be achieved by fully automating the tuning process. One crucial step is to trap the appropriate number of electrons in the quantum dots, typically accomplished by analyzing charge stability diagrams (CSDs). Training and testing automation algorithms require large amounts of data, which can be either measured and manually labeled in an experiment or simulated. This article introduces a new approach to the realistic simulation of such measurements. Our flexible framework enables the simulation of ideal CSD data complemented with appropriate sensor responses and distortions. We suggest using this simulation to benchmark published algorithms. Also, we encourage the extension by custom models and parameter sets to drive the development of robust, technology-independent algorithms. Code is available at this https URL.

Title: Short-Range Order and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ Probability Maps for Disordered Rocksalt Cathodes
Authors: Tzu-chen Liu, Steven B. Torrisi, Chris Wolverton
Abstract: Short-range order (SRO) in the cation-disordered state is a controlling factor influencing the probability of finding Li$_{4}$ tetrahedron clusters in disordered rocksalt (DRX) cathode materials. However, the prevalent Li$_4$ probability below the random limit across reported DRX compositions has not been systematically investigated, active strategies to surpass the random limit of Li$_4$ probability are lacking, and the fundamental ordering behavior on the face-centered cubic (FCC) lattice remains insufficiently explored. This research quantitatively examines pair SRO parameters and Li$_x$TM$_{4-x}$ probabilities via exhaustive Monte Carlo mapping across a simplified subset of the parameter space. The results indicate that, in the disordered state, the Li$_4$ probability is governed by the nearest neighbor (NN) pair-wise SRO parameter, and that these quantities do not necessarily represent a simple attenuation of their corresponding low-temperature long-range order, particularly for the important cases of Layered and Spinel-like orderings. Strategies are proposed to mitigate or even reverse the lithium and transition metals mixing tendency of NN pair SRO to achieve Li$_4$ probabilities that exceed the random limit. This study advances the fundamental thermodynamic understanding of ordering behaviors, which can be generalized to any FCC system.

Title: Straintronics across Lieb-Kagome interconversion and variable transport scaling exponents
Authors: Shashikant Singh Kunwar, Madhuparna Karmakar
Abstract: We propose a novel protocol of low-temperature, strain-tuned re-entrant metal-insulator transition and crossover between strongly correlated line-graph lattices (Lieb and Kagome). Using a non-perturbative numerical approach, we demonstrate for the first time that an applied shear strain stabilizes a metallic phase cradled in between a gapped magnetic insulator and a gapless flat band localized insulator, facilitating the Lieb/Kagome interconversion. Our results on transport signatures exhibit variable scaling exponents for electrical resistivity and optical conductivity, providing clear evidence of non-Fermi liquid physics. We also define a strain-dependent thermal scale to quantify the crossover between the non-Fermi liquid and bad metal phases.

Title: An effective potential for generative modelling with active matter
Authors: Adrian Baule
Abstract: Score-based diffusion models generate samples from a complex underlying data distribution by time-reversal of a diffusion process and represent the state-of-the-art in many generative AI applications such as artificial image synthesis. Here, I show how a generative diffusion model can be implemented based on an underlying active particle process with finite correlation time. In contrast to previous approaches that use a score function acting on the velocity coordinate of the active particle, time reversal is here achieved by imposing an effective time-dependent potential on the position coordinate only. The effective potential is valid to first order in the persistence time and leads to a force field that is fully determined by the standard score function and its derivatives up to 2nd order. Numerical experiments for artificial data distributions confirm the validity of the effective potential.

Title: Spin liquid and glass behavior in quantum spin models with all-to-all p-spin interactions
Authors: Shusei Wadashima, Yukitoshi Motome
Abstract: Spin liquid and spin glass states represent two distinct phases of disordered quantum spin systems. These states are, in principle, distinguished by quantum-entangled fluctuations and spin-freezing, but identifying each state and characterizing the transition between them remain challenging. Here, we systematically explore the relationship between the spin liquid and spin glass states using a model with all-to-all random interactions among $p$ spins, which interpolates between the Ising-like one-component, XY-like two-component, and isotropic three-component cases. By analyzing the system-size $N$ dependence of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter and the density of states, we identify the transition from the spin liquid to the spin glass for various values of $p$. We show that the phase diagrams for different $p$ can be unified through a scaling with $N/p^2$, revealing that increasing anisotropy in the interactions systematically suppresses the spin liquid phase and extends the spin glass regime. Furthermore, we examine the competition between multiple-spin interactions and anisotropy under an external magnetic field in the isotropic case, and find that the spin liquid phase transitions into the spin glass phase before entering a quantum paramagnetic phase. Our findings provide new insights into quantum disordered phases and the transitions between them.

Title: A catastrophic approach to designing interacting hysterons
Authors: Gentian Muhaxheri, Victoria Antonetti, Christian D. Santangelo
Abstract: We present a framework for analyzing collections of interacting hysterons through the lens of catastrophe theory. By modeling hysteron dynamics as a gradient system, we show how to construct hysteron transition graphs by characterizing the fold bifurcations of the dynamical system. Transition graphs represent the sequence of hysterons switching states, providing critical insights into the collective behavior of driven disordered media. Extending this analysis to higher codimension bifurcations, such as cusp bifurcations and crossings of fold curves, allows us to map out how the topology of transition graphs changes with variations in system parameters. This approach can suggest strategies for designing metamaterials capable of encoding targeted memory and computational functionalities, but it also highlights the rapid increase of design complexity with system size, further underscoring the computational challenges of controlling large hysteretic systems.

Title: Readout of multi-level quantum geometry from electronic transport
Authors: Raffael L. Klees, Mónica Benito
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) of a quantum system in a given parameter space captures both the geometry of the state manifold and the topology of the system. While the local QGT elements have been successfully measured in various platforms, the challenge of detecting them in electronic transport systems - such as tunnel or molecular junctions - has yet to be resolved. To fill this gap, we propose a measurement protocol based on weak and resonant parameter modulations, and theoretically demonstrate how the local QGT in such systems can be directly probed from changes of the tunnel conductance. This approach enables the measurement of both geometrical and topological features of quantum states in a broad class of transport-based quantum systems.

Title: Symmetry-Enriched Topological Phases and Their Gauging: A String-Net Model Realization
Authors: Nianrui Fu, Yu Zhao, Yidun Wan
Abstract: We present a systematic framework for constructing exactly-solvable lattice models of symmetry-enriched topological (SET) phases based on an enlarged version of the string-net model. We also gauge the global symmetries of our SET models to obtain string-net models of pure topological phases. Without invoking externally imposed onsite symmetry actions, our approach promotes the string-net model of a pure topological order, specified by an input unitary fusion category $\mathscr{F}$, to an SET model, specified by a multifusion category together with a set of isomorphisms. Two complementary construction strategies are developed in the main text: (i) promotion via outer automorphisms of $\mathscr{F}$ and (ii) promotion via the Frobenius algebras of $\mathscr{F}$. The global symmetries derived via these two strategies are intrinsic to topological phases and are thus termed blood symmetries, as opposed to adopted symmetries, which can be arbitrarily imposed on topological phases. We propose the concept of symmetry-gauging family of topological phases, which are related by gauging their blood symmetries. With our approach, we construct the first explicit lattice realization of a nonabelian-symmetry-enriched topological phase -- the $S_3$ symmetry-enriched $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum-double phase. The approach further reveals the role of local excitations in SET phases and establishes their symmetry constraints.

Title: Identifying nonequilibrium degrees of freedom in high-dimensional stochastic systems
Authors: Catherine Ji, Ravin Raj, Benjamin Eysenbach, Gautam Reddy
Abstract: Any coarse-grained description of a nonequilibrium system should faithfully represent its latent irreversible degrees of freedom. However, standard dimensionality reduction methods typically prioritize accurate reconstruction over physical relevance. Here, we introduce a model-free approach to identify irreversible degrees of freedom in stochastic systems that are in a nonequilibrium steady state. Our method leverages the insight that a black-box classifier, trained to differentiate between forward and time-reversed trajectories, implicitly estimates the local entropy production rate. By parameterizing this classifier as a quadratic form of learned state representations, we obtain nonlinear embeddings of high-dimensional state-space dynamics, which we term Latent Embeddings of Nonequilibrium Systems (LENS). LENS effectively identifies low-dimensional irreversible flows and provides a scalable, learning-based strategy for estimating entropy production rates directly from high-dimensional time series data.

P. Zhao, Kai Xu, Dongning Zheng, Franco Nori, Heng Fan
Abstract: Quantum simulation of different exotic topological phases of quantum matter on a noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) processor is attracting growing interest. Here, we develop a one-dimensional 43-qubit superconducting quantum processor, named as Chuang-tzu, to simulate and characterize emergent topological states. By engineering diagonal Aubry-Andr$\acute{\mathrm{e}}$-Harper (AAH) models, we experimentally demonstrate the Hofstadter butterfly energy spectrum. Using Floquet engineering, we verify the existence of the topological zero modes in the commensurate off-diagonal AAH models, which have never been experimentally realized before. Remarkably, the qubit number over 40 in our quantum processor is large enough to capture the substantial topological features of a quantum system from its complex band structure, including Dirac points, the energy gap's closing, the difference between even and odd number of sites, and the distinction between edge and bulk states. Our results establish a versatile hybrid quantum simulation approach to exploring quantum topological systems in the NISQ era.

Title: Probing spin hydrodynamics on a superconducting quantum simulator

Abstract: Characterizing the nature of hydrodynamical transport properties in quantum dynamics provides valuable insights into the fundamental understanding of exotic non-equilibrium phases of matter. Experimentally simulating infinite-temperature transport on large-scale complex quantum systems is of considerable interest. Here, using a controllable and coherent superconducting quantum simulator, we experimentally realize the analog quantum circuit, which can efficiently prepare the Haar-random states, and probe spin transport at infinite temperature. We observe diffusive spin transport during the unitary evolution of the ladder-type quantum simulator with ergodic dynamics. Moreover, we explore the transport properties of the systems subjected to strong disorder or a tilted potential, revealing signatures of anomalous subdiffusion in accompany with the breakdown of thermalization. Our work demonstrates a scalable method of probing infinite-temperature spin transport on analog quantum simulators, which paves the way to study other intriguing out-of-equilibrium phenomena from the perspective of transport.

Title: High-density and scalable graphene Hall sensor arrays through monolithic CMOS integration
Authors: Vasant Iyer, Nishal Shah, A.T. Charlie Johnson, David A. Issadore, Firooz Aflatouni
Abstract: Electronic devices made from two-dimensional materials (2DMs) significantly outperform their silicon counterparts; however, silicon CMOS technology remains commercially predominant as it offers the capability to operate dense arrays of devices in a scalable fashion. In particular, graphene Hall sensors (GHSs) offer great improvements in magnetic field sensitivity and resolution compared to silicon Hall-effect sensors, making them extremely appealing for magnetic field imaging and biosensing. At present, GHS arrays have limited scalability compared to silicon CMOS since they require planar routing for biasing and multiplexing. In this work, we explore strategies to realize high-density graphene Hall sensor arrays by vertically connecting GHSs with silicon CMOS biasing and multiplexing circuitry, allowing the routing and circuitry to scale with the array. We investigate the importance of design choices in the chip layout and post-fabrication process in maximizing the reliability of graphene transfer onto mm-scale CMOS dies. Our experimental results validate the success of the integration process by showing for the first time that GHSs can be monolithically integrated with CMOS with high yield to form sensor arrays. We expect that these results will lead to further improvements in magnetic sensing technology and broader advancements in large-scale heterogeneous 2DM-CMOS systems.

Title: Multiscale Microscopy via Automation: Dual Magnification ESEM Imaging by Frame Alternation
Authors: Maurits Vuijk, Johannes Zeininger, Luis Sandoval, Günther Rupprechter, Beatriz Roldan Cuenya, Karsten Reuter, Thomas Lunkenbein, Christoph Scheurer
Abstract: In Environmental Scanning Electron Microscopy (ESEM) experiments, the acquisition parameters are generally kept constant throughout the collection of a data set. This limits data collection to one data set at a time, and frequent human interaction is required to maintain the image quality. Here, we use a custom-designed automation interface to minimize such supervision and allow for the collection of multiple interlaced data sets simultaneously. The oscillatory modes of an example catalytic system (hydrogen oxidation over Co foil) were employed as a tunable spatiotemporal test case. Using our automation interface, we can implement more advanced acquisition programs into the microscope that allow dual imaging - effectively bridging reaction monitoring between different length scales. By using automation to change the settings of the acquisition after each frame, we are able to capture alternating magnifications of the same process and sample location. Both a low magnification overview of the mesoscopic surface dynamics and a high magnification field of view of the ongoing structural changes of a selected surface motif were acquired. Using such truly correlative data captured with the dual magnification method, cross-scale correlations about catalytic systems including phase information can be established.

Title: Imaging 3D Printed Fracture Networks under Stress using X-Ray Computed Tomography
Authors: A. Patsoukis Dimou, Q. Lei, N. Watanabe, A. Suzuki
Abstract: We present a novel experimental approach based on 3D printing and X-ray computed tomography to characterize fracture aperture distribution and evolution in 3D fracture networks under varying stress loading conditions. We validate our methodology by comparing experimentally measured stress-dependent fracture apertures with both analytical solutions and numerical simulations, for both single fracture and fracture network scenarios. We show that, for fracture deformation under linear elastic regime, our experimental results agree with numerical simulation. Furthermore, by combining our new experimental methodology with advanced numerical simulations, we illuminate the complex interplay of stress and topology in fracture network deformation. Our approach opens the door for experimentally observing deformable fracture networks under stress in 3D space, which has significant implications for understanding and predicting many geophysical problems involving fractured geological media.

Title: Operationalizing Serendipity: Multi-Agent AI Workflows for Enhanced Materials Characterization with Theory-in-the-Loop
Authors: Lance Yao, Suman Samantray, Ayana Ghosh, Kevin Roccapriore, Libor Kovarik, Sarah Allec, Maxim Ziatdinov
Abstract: The history of science is punctuated by serendipitous discoveries, where unexpected observations, rather than targeted hypotheses, opened new fields of inquiry. While modern autonomous laboratories excel at accelerating hypothesis testing, their optimization for efficiency risks overlooking these crucial, unplanned findings. To address this gap, we introduce SciLink, an open-source, multi-agent artificial intelligence framework designed to operationalize serendipity in materials research by creating a direct, automated link between experimental observation, novelty assessment, and theoretical simulations. The framework employs a hybrid AI strategy where specialized machine learning models perform quantitative analysis of experimental data, while large language models handle higher-level reasoning. These agents autonomously convert raw data from materials characterization techniques into falsifiable scientific claims, which are then quantitatively scored for novelty against the published literature. We demonstrate the framework's versatility across diverse research scenarios, showcasing its application to atomic-resolution and hyperspectral data, its capacity to integrate real-time human expert guidance, and its ability to close the research loop by proposing targeted follow-up experiments. By systematically analyzing all observations and contextualizing them, SciLink provides a practical framework for AI-driven materials research that not only enhances efficiency but also actively cultivates an environment ripe for serendipitous discoveries, thereby bridging the gap between automated experimentation and open-ended scientific exploration.

Title: Generative Artificial Intelligence Extracts Structure-Function Relationships from Plants for New Materials
Authors: Rachel K. Luu, Jingyu Deng, Mohammed Shahrudin Ibrahim, Nam-Joon Cho, Ming Dao, Subra Suresh, Markus J. Buehler
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) have reshaped the research landscape by enabling new approaches to knowledge retrieval and creative ideation. Yet their application in discipline-specific experimental science, particularly in highly multi-disciplinary domains like materials science, remains limited. We present a first-of-its-kind framework that integrates generative AI with literature from hitherto-unconnected fields such as plant science, biomimetics, and materials engineering to extract insights and design experiments for materials. We focus on humidity-responsive systems such as pollen-based materials and Rhapis excelsa (broadleaf lady palm) leaves, which exhibit self-actuation and adaptive performance. Using a suite of AI tools, including a fine-tuned model (BioinspiredLLM), Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), agentic systems, and a Hierarchical Sampling strategy, we extract structure-property relationships and translate them into new classes of bioinspired materials. Structured inference protocols generate and evaluate hundreds of hypotheses from a single query, surfacing novel and experimentally tractable ideas. We validate our approach through real-world implementation: LLM-generated procedures, materials designs, and mechanical predictions were tested in the laboratory, culminating in the fabrication of a novel pollen-based adhesive with tunable morphology and measured shear strength, establishing a foundation for future plant-derived adhesive design. This work demonstrates how AI-assisted ideation can drive real-world materials design and enable effective human-AI collaboration.

Title: Learning to stabilize nonequilibrium phases of matter with active feedback using partial information
Authors: Giovanni Cemin, Markus Schmitt, Marin Bukov
Abstract: We investigate the role of information in active feedback control of quantum many-body systems using reinforcement learning. Active feedback breaks detailed balance, enabling the engineering of steady states and dynamical phases of matter otherwise inaccessible in equilibrium. We train reinforcement learning agents using partial state information to prevent entanglement spreading in (1+1)-dimensional stabilizer circuits with up to 128 qubits. We find that, above a critical information threshold, learned near-optimal strategies are non-greedy, stochastic, and reduce volume-law entangled steady states to area-law scaling. The agents achieve this by placing a series of bottlenecks that induce pyramidal structures in the long-time spatial entanglement distribution, which effectively split the system and reduce the maximum accessible entanglement. Crucially, learned strategies are inherently out of equilibrium and require real-time active feedback; we find that the learned behavior cannot be replaced by simple human-designed control rules. This work establishes the foundations for classically implemented, information-driven individual control of many interacting quantum degrees of freedom, demonstrating the capabilities of reinforcement learning to stabilize and uncover novel critical properties of many-body nonequilibrium steady states.

Title: Local Diffusion Models and Phases of Data Distributions
Authors: Fangjun Hu, Guangkuo Liu, Yifan Zhang, Xun Gao
Abstract: As a class of generative artificial intelligence frameworks inspired by statistical physics, diffusion models have shown extraordinary performance in synthesizing complicated data distributions through a denoising process gradually guided by score functions. Real-life data, like images, is often spatially structured in low-dimensional spaces. However, ordinary diffusion models ignore this local structure and learn spatially global score functions, which are often computationally expensive. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on the phases of data distributions, which provides insight into constructing local denoisers with reduced computational costs. We define two distributions as belonging to the same data distribution phase if they can be mutually connected via spatially local operations such as local denoisers. Then, we show that the reverse denoising process consists of an early trivial phase and a late data phase, sandwiching a rapid phase transition where local denoisers must fail. To diagnose such phase transitions, we prove an information-theoretic bound on the fidelity of local denoisers based on conditional mutual information, and conduct numerical experiments in a real-world dataset. This work suggests simpler and more efficient architectures of diffusion models: far from the phase transition point, we can use small local neural networks to compute the score function; global neural networks are only necessary around the narrow time interval of phase transitions. This result also opens up new directions for studying phases of data distributions, the broader science of generative artificial intelligence, and guiding the design of neural networks inspired by physics concepts.

Title: TorchSim: An efficient atomistic simulation engine in PyTorch
Authors: Orion Cohen, Janosh Riebesell, Rhys Goodall, Adeesh Kolluru, Stefano Falletta, Joseph Krause, Jorge Colindres, Gerbrand Ceder, Abhijeet S. Gangan
Abstract: We introduce TorchSim, an open-source atomistic simulation engine tailored for the Machine Learned Interatomic Potential (MLIP) era. By rewriting core atomistic simulation primitives in PyTorch, TorchSim can achieve orders of magnitude acceleration for popular MLIPs. Unlike existing molecular dynamics packages, which simulate one system at a time, TorchSim performs batched simulations that efficiently utilize modern GPUs by evolving multiple systems concurrently. TorchSim supports molecular dynamics integrators, structural relaxation optimizers, both machine-learned and classical interatomic potentials (such as Lennard-Jones, Morse, soft-sphere), batching with automatic memory management, differentiable simulation, and integration with popular materials informatics tools.

Title: Limiting risk to reduce inequality: insights from the Yard-Sale model
Authors: Lautaro Giordano, Ignacio Cortés, Sebastian Gonçalves, María Fabiana Laguna
Abstract: Wealth inequality remains a critical socioeconomic challenge, driven by systemic dynamics and self-reinforcing mechanisms that amplify the economic imbalances. Simplified models from statistical physics provide valuable insights into the fundamental mechanisms governing wealth distribution. In this study, we extend the Yard-Sale model -- a minimal kinetic exchange framework -- to investigate how limiting risk in economic transactions affects inequality. While previous research demonstrates that such models naturally lead to wealth concentration, we introduce a mechanism that restricts the maximum risk agents can assume during exchanges. Numerical simulations reveal that this modification fosters more equitable wealth distributions and significantly reduces extreme disparities. These findings highlight the importance of individual-level constraints in shaping systemic outcomes, offering new perspectives on promoting economic balance.

Title: Wealth Inequality in Agent-Based Economies: The Dominant Role of Social Protection over Growth
Authors: Gastón Villafañe, Lautaro Giordano, María Fabiana Laguna
Abstract: Persistent wealth inequality, where a small fraction of the population accumulates most resources while the majority remains economically vulnerable, is a widespread phenomenon. We investigate its underlying mechanisms using an agent-based Yard-Sale model that incorporates two complementary features: transaction rules that favor poorer agents, representing social protection policies, and an economic growth process with explicit wealth redistribution. Our results reveal that social protection plays a dominant role in reducing inequality, while redistribution primarily serves to reintegrate excluded agents. These findings suggest that social protection policies, that is, targeted mechanisms favoring economically vulnerable agents, may have a substantially greater impact on reducing inequality than redistribution driven solely by economic growth. We also find that both the shape of the wealth distributions and the resulting inequality levels are strongly influenced by the underlying distribution of individual risk, highlighting the importance of considering agent heterogeneity when modeling economic dynamics.

Title: Modeling revolutions in networked societies: learning from the Tunisian spring
Authors: Daniel Aguilar-Velázquez, Denis Boyer, Robert Boyer
Abstract: Economic competition and deregulation have led to a polarization of societies between a small, increasingly powerful elite and a majority of socially excluded individuals, marginalized and unconnected to political representations. This is the breeding ground for protest movements, relayed by local ties and amplified by social networks. Based on the characteristics revealed by socio-economic research into the Arab revolutions of the 2010s, this article proposes a formalization inspired by the theory of complex systems. We discuss the conditions under which an initial localized event - for example, the suicide of a street vendor condemned to ruin in a small Tunisian town - can trigger an explosion of the number of opponents to the regime, typical of a revolutionary episode. We consider a network model of agents and oppressors where pair interactions are controlled by a fear parameter, or the inclination of the individuals to rebel despite of repression. The model exhibits a phase transition at a critical threshold above which the quiescent state becomes unstable. Furthermore, the ability of individuals to forge triadic relationships accelerates the process of joining a rising rebellion, making the transition more abrupt, in the form of a brutal discontinuity that can be described as revolutionary. The imposition of a counter-revolution by the hardening of repression can be explained by the hysteresis property displayed by the model: when mobilization has extended the initial network and made it partially permanent, repression by the authorities must be tightened to higher levels than before to regain control.

Title: Response Theory for Static and Dynamic Solvation of Ionic and Dipolar Solutes in Water
Authors: Renjie Zhao, Richard C. Remsing, John D. Weeks
Abstract: The response of polar solvents to ions and polar molecules dictates many fundamental molecular processes. To understand such electrostatically-driven solvation processes, one ideally would probe the dielectric response of a solvent to an idealized point test charge or dipole solute, as envisioned in classic continuum treatments of the problem. However, this is difficult in simulations using standard atomically-detailed solvent models with embedded point charges due to possible overlap with the test charge that lead to singular interaction energies. This problem is traditionally avoided for a realistic charged solute by introducing an excluded volume core that shields its embedded point charge or dipole from the charges in the solvent. However, this core introduces additional molecular-scale perturbations of the solvent density that complicate the interpretation of solvent dielectric response. In this work, we avoid these complications through the use of Gaussian-smoothed test charges and dipoles. Gaussian charges and dipoles can be readily inserted anywhere into an atomistic solvent model without encountering infinite energies. If the Gaussian-smoothing is on the scale of molecular correlations in the solvent, both the thermodynamic and dynamic solvation response is linear. Using this observation, we construct accurate predictive theories for solvation free energies and solvation dynamics for insertion of Gaussian charges and dipoles in polar solvents and demonstrate the accuracy of the theories for a widely-used model of water. Our results suggest that Gaussian test charge distributions can be used as an informative probe of dielectric response in molecular models, and our theories can be used to analytically predict the largest component of solvation free energies of charged and polar solutes.

Title: Nuclear Angular Momentum Generation in Thermally Driven Chiral Systems
Authors: Jichen Feng, Ethan Abraham, Joseph Subotnik, Abraham Nitzan
Abstract: The appearance of angular momentum in the nuclear motion of molecular systems lacking inversion symmetry under imposed thermal gradients presents a novel mechanism with potential implications for spintronics, magnetic response, and energy transport in such systems. Here we explore this phenomenon, using theoretical analysis and numerical simulations to study angular momentum generation in several driven chiral molecular models. We demonstrate that significant vibrational angular momentum can be induced under both mechanical and thermal driving, with magnitude comparable to that induced in optically driven chiral phonons. We find that generation of angular momentum is a common and general phenomenon in driven chiral structures, highlighting the role of symmetry-breaking in the (non-equilibrium) internal atomic motion of such systems.

Title: Quantized Thouless Pumping of Dark Solitons
Authors: Yu-Liang Tao, Huaxin He, Hao Lyu, Yongping Zhang, Yong Xu
Abstract: Nonlinearity enables the emergence of localized waves such as solitons that maintain their shapes during propagation. Solitons are broadly classified into bright and dark solitons. While a bright soliton exhibits a density peak, a dark soliton presents as a defect on a continuous wave background. A distinctive feature of dark solitons is the abrupt phase change in their wave function, which can host Majorana zero modes in topological fermionic superfluids. Recent studies have shown that bright solitons can undergo quantized transport through Thouless pumping, where the bright soliton functions as a Wannier function. However, it remains unclear whether Thouless pumping can also occur for dark solitons, which fundamentally differ from bright solitons. Here, we theoretically demonstrate the occurrence of both integer and fractional Thouless pumping for dark solitons within both a continuous model under optical lattices and a tight-binding model. Specifically, we find that a dark soliton is transported by one or half a unit cell, following the center-of-mass position of a Wannier function, as a system parameter is slowly varied over one cycle. Our work opens new avenues for exploring Thouless pumping for defects with phase changes, such as dark solitons, vortex solitons, ring dark solitons, and vortices.

Title: Depth-Resolved Vibrational SFG/DFG Spectroscopy of the Anisotropic Water Structure at Charged Interfaces
Authors: Álvaro Diaz-Duque, Vasileios Balos, Alexander P. Fellows, Martin Wolf, Martin Thämer
Abstract: The molecular structure of water at charged aqueous interfaces is shaped by interfacial electric fields, which can induce significant anisotropy in the molecular orientations that extends over nanometer-scale distances. Despite great relevance, very little is known about the details of this depth-dependent anisotropic water structure, mainly due to the lack of appropriate experimental techniques. Here, we present a time-domain spectrometer specifically developed to acquire depth-resolved nonlinear vibrational spectra at aqueous interfaces. The approach is based on combining phase-resolved vibrational sum- and difference-frequency spectra and enables the extraction of depth information on the nanometer scale. The analysis of the acquired resonant spectral line shapes meanwhile yields insight into local hydrogen-bond structures and anisotropic molecular orientations across the interfacial region. In measurements with insoluble charged surfactants, we demonstrate that the obtained data allows for a full reconstruction of the nonlinear vibrational responses as function of depth. The results show the presence of two pronounced regions within the interfacial anisotropy with largely deviating degrees of preferential molecular orientations. A spectral analysis of the depth-dependent vibrational responses furthermore reveals that the natural local hydrogen-bond structure of bulk water remains intact throughout the interfacial region, including water in the direct proximity of the surface charges. These findings significantly refine our understanding of the anisotropic water structure at the interface to charged surfactants and showcase the large potential of our depth-resolved spectroscopic technique.

Title: How to simulate Lévy flights in a steep potential: An explicit splitting numerical scheme
Authors: Ilya Pavlyukevich, Olga Aryasova, Alexei Chechkin, Oleksii Kulyk
Abstract: We propose an effective explicit numerical scheme for simulating solutions of stochastic differential equations with confining superlinear drift terms, driven by multiplicative heavy-tailed Lévy noise. The scheme is designed to prevent explosion and accurately capture all finite moments of the solutions. In the purely Gaussian case, it correctly reproduces moments of sub-Gaussian tails of the solutions. This method is particularly well-suited for approximating statistical moments and other probabilistic characteristics of Lévy flights in steep potential landscapes.

Title: Ion Coulomb crystals: an exotic form of condensed matter
Authors: Giovanna Morigi, John Bollinger, Michael Drewsen, Daniel Podolsky, Efrat Shimshoni
Abstract: Wigner crystals formed by laser-cooled ions in traps are unconventional condensed-matter systems, characterized by interparticle distances of several micrometers and energy scales on the order of $\mu$eV. Their crystalline structure emerges from the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and the external confining potential, which can be readily tuned. Moreover, individual ions can be precisely manipulated with lasers and imaged via resonance fluorescence. These unusual and unique properties make ion crystals a powerful platform for studying phases of matter and their dynamics in the strongly correlated quantum regime. This review examines the theoretical framework and experimental characterization of ion Coulomb crystals from a condensed-matter perspective. We highlight their dynamical and thermodynamic properties in one, two, and three dimensions, along with recent investigations into their out-of-equilibrium behavior. We provide outlooks on future directions for exploring novel condensed matter phenomena with trapped ion crystals, as well as their many scientific and technical applications, which have driven advances in controlling and measuring ion crystals in the lab.

Title: Universally Robust Control of Open Quantum Systems
Authors: Lixiang Ding, Jingtao Fan, Xingze Qiu
Abstract: Mitigating noise-induced decoherence is the central challenge in controlling open quantum systems. While existing robust protocols often require precise noise models, we introduce a universal framework for noise-agnostic quantum control that achieves high-fidelity operations without prior environmental noise characterization. This framework capitalizes on the dynamical modification of the system-environment coupling through control drives, an effect rigorously encoded in the dynamical equation. Since the derived noise sensitivity metric remains independent of the coupling details between the system and the environment, our protocol demonstrates provable robustness against arbitrary Markovian noises. Numerical validation through quantum state transfer and gate operations reveals near-unity fidelity ($>\!99\%$) across diverse noise regimes, achieving orders-of-magnitude error suppression compared to target-only approaches. This framework bridges critical gaps between theoretical control design and experimental constraints, establishing a hardware-agnostic pathway toward fault-tolerant quantum technologies across platforms such as superconducting circuits, trapped ions, and solid-state qubits.

Title: Conditional splitting probabilities for hidden-state inference in drift-diffusive processes
Authors: Emir Sezik, Jacob Knight, Henry Alston, Connor Roberts, Thibault Bertrand, Gunnar Pruessner, Luca Cocconi
Abstract: Splitting probabilities quantify the likelihood of particular outcomes out of a set of mutually-exclusive possibilities for stochastic processes and play a central role in first-passage problems. For two-dimensional Markov processes $\{X(t),Y(t)\}_{t\in T}$, a joint analogue of the splitting probabilities can be defined, which captures the likelihood that the variable $X(t)$, having been initialised at $x_0 \in \mathbb{L}$, exits $\mathbb{L}$ for the first time via either of the interval boundaries \emph{and} that the variable $Y(t)$, initialised at $y_0$, is given by $y_{\rm exit}$ at the time of exit. We compute such joint splitting probabilities for two classes of processes: processes where $X(t)$ is Brownian motion and $Y(t)$ is a decoupled internal state, and unidirectionally coupled processes where $X(t)$ is drift-diffusive and depends on $Y(t)$, while $Y(t)$ evolves independently. For the first class we obtain generic expressions in terms of the eigensystem of the Fokker-Planck operator for the $Y$ dynamics, while for the second we carry out explicit derivations for three paradigmatic cases (run-and-tumble motion, diffusion in an intermittent piecewise-linear potential and diffusion with stochastic resetting). Drawing on Bayes' theorem, we subsequently introduce the related notion of conditional splitting probabilities, defined as the posterior likelihoods of the internal state $Y$ \emph{given} that the observable degree of freedom $X$ has undergone a specific exit event. After computing these conditional splitting probabilities, we propose a simple scheme that leverages them to partially infer the assumedly hidden state $Y(t)$ from point-wise detection events.

Title: Nonequilibrium steady state in Lindblad dynamics for infinite quantum spin systems
Authors: Kenji Shimomura, Nagisa Hara, Seiichiro Kusuoka
Abstract: We consider Lindblad dynamics of quantum spin systems on infinite lattices and define a nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) and a time-averaged nonequilibrium steady state (TANESS) on the basis of $C^*$-algebraic formalism. Generically, the NESS on an infinite system does not equal the thermodynamic limit of NESSs on finite systems. We give a sufficient condition that they coincide with each other, in terms of both a condition number, which quantifies the normality of a Liouvillian, and some spectral gaps on finite subsystems. To appreciate the importance of the condition number, we provide an example in which the spectral gaps have nonzero lower bounds uniformly for any finite subsystems but a thermodynamic limit and a long-time limit (or a long-time average) do not commute with each other.

Title: A Method for Constructing Quasi-Random Peaked Quantum Circuits
Authors: O.G. Udalov
Abstract: An algorithm is proposed for constructing quasi-random "peaked" quantum circuits, i.e., circuits whose final qubit state exhibits a high probability concentration on a specific computational basis state. These circuits consist of random gates arranged in a brick-wall architecture. While the multiqubit state in the middle of the circuit can exhibit significant entanglement, the final state is, with high probability, a predetermined pure bitstring. A technique is introduced to obscure the final bitstring in the structure of the quantum circuit. The algorithm allows precise control over the probability of the final peaked state. A modified version of the algorithm enables the construction of double- or multi-peaked quantum circuits. The matrix product state (MPS) method is evaluated for simulating such circuits; it performs effectively for shallow peaked circuits but offers no significant advantage for deeper ones.

Title: Time Ordering Effects and Destruction of Quasiparticles in Two-dimensional Holographic CFTs
Authors: Weibo Mao, Masahiro Nozaki
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the entanglement dynamics induced by a composite operator, defined as the local operator evolved with the time evolution operator constructed of the Euclidean and Lorentzian ones. The systems under consideration are described by two-dimensional holographic conformal field theories (2d holographic CFTs), the theories described by gravity. Then, we find that the time ordering of Euclidean and Lorentzian time evolutions affects the behavior of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation, especially their late-time ones. We also establish the relation between entanglement entropy and energy-momentum densities. This relation states that the late-time behaviors of bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation strongly depend on the energy distribution. We also examine how the decay of the quasiparticle influences the bipartite entanglement and non-local correlation. Furthermore, we investigate the gravity dual of the systems considered in this paper.

Title: Estimating classical mutual information between quantum subsystems with neural networks
Authors: D. A. Konyshev, V. V. Mazurenko
Abstract: Characterizing correlations in a quantum system on the basis of the results of the projective measurements can be performed with different means including the calculation of the classical mutual information. Generally, estimating such information-entropy-based quantities requires having complete statistics of the system's states. Here we explore the possibility to reconstruct the classical mutual information and specific entropy of a quantum system with neural network approach on the basis of limited number of projective measurements. As a prominent example we consider the antiferromagnetic quantum Ising model in transverse and longitudinal magnetic fields which is in demand in both condensed matter physics and quantum computing. We show that the neural network approach gives reliable estimates of the classical mutual information even in the case of paramagnetic wave functions delocalized in the state space. In addition, the phase diagram of the considered quantum system is reconstructed with a special focus on discriminating various types of disordered states.

Title: Topological quantum electrodynamics in synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields
Authors: Qinan Huang, Bengy T. T. Wong, Zehai Pang, Xudong Zhang, Zeling Chen, Yi Yang
Abstract: Quantum electrodynamics (QED), a cornerstone framework that describes light-matter interactions rooted in Abelian symmetries, renders the harnessing of synthetic non-Abelian gauge fields as a fundamental yet uncharted frontier. Here, we develop a general theory of light-matter interaction of quantum emitters embedded in non-Abelian photonic lattices. Based on analytical solutions to the non-Abelian Landau dressed states beyond the continuum limit, we reveal chiral photon emission and vortices with emergent nonreciprocity enabled by selective coupling between emitters and spin-momentum-locked bands. When coexisting with Abelian and non-Abelian magnetic fields, emitters hybridize with Landau dressed orbits to form spin-polarized, squeezed Landau polaritons that carry quantized angular momenta, with Rabi frequencies tunable via Landau levels and pseudospin interactions. Multi-emitter dynamics further exhibit collective phenomena governed by real-space staggered phases induced by nonsymmorphic crystalline symmetry. These results bridge non-Abelian physics with quantum optics, and establish non-Abelian gauge fields as a versatile tool for synthesizing topological quantum optical states, angular momentum transfer, and controlling photon-mediated correlations in QED systems, relevant for applications in quantum simulations and chiral quantum optical networks.

Title: Observation and Modulation of the Quantum Mpemba Effect on a Superconducting Quantum Processor

Abstract: In non-equilibrium quantum many-body systems, the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) emerges as a counterintuitive phenomenon: systems exhibiting greater initial symmetry breaking restore symmetry faster than those with less. While theoretical exploration of QME has surged, experimental studies on its multidimensional modulation remain limited. Here, we report the observation and control of QME using a superconducting processor featuring a unique fully connected, tunable-coupling architecture that enables precise modulation from short- to long-range interactions. This platform allows independent manipulation of coupling regimes, on-site potentials, and initial states, elucidating their roles in QME. To quantify symmetry restoration, we employ entanglement asymmetry (EA) -- the relative entropy between a subsystem reduced density matrix and its symmetric projection -- as a sensitive probe of symmetry breaking. In strong short-range coupling regimes, EA crossovers during quenches from tilted Néel states confirm the presence of QME. In contrast, in intermediate coupling regimes, synchronized EA and entanglement entropy dynamics reveal the suppression of QME. Remarkably, QME reemerges with the introduction of on-site linear potentials or quenches from tilted ferromagnetic states, the latter proving robust against on-site disorder. Our study provides the first demonstration of flexible QME modulation on a superconducting platform with multiple controllable parameters, shedding light on quantum many-body non-equilibrium dynamics and opening avenues for quantum information applications.

Title: Material Fingerprinting: A shortcut to material model discovery without solving optimization problems
Authors: Moritz Flaschel, Denisa Martonová, Carina Veil, Ellen Kuhl
Abstract: We propose Material Fingerprinting, a new method for the rapid discovery of mechanical material models from direct or indirect data that avoids solving potentially non-convex optimization problems. The core assumption of Material Fingerprinting is that each material exhibits a unique response when subjected to a standardized experimental setup. We can interpret this response as the material's fingerprint, essentially a unique identifier that encodes all pertinent information about the material's mechanical characteristics. Consequently, once we have established a database containing fingerprints and their corresponding mechanical models during an offline phase, we can rapidly characterize an unseen material in an online phase. This is accomplished by measuring its fingerprint and employing a pattern recognition algorithm to identify the best matching fingerprint in the database. In our study, we explore this concept in the context of hyperelastic materials, demonstrating the applicability of Material Fingerprinting across different experimental setups. Initially, we examine Material Fingerprinting through experiments involving homogeneous deformation fields, which provide direct strain-stress data pairs. We then extend this concept to experiments involving complexly shaped specimens with heterogeneous deformation fields, which provide indirect displacement and reaction force measurements. We show that, in both cases, Material Fingerprinting is an efficient tool for model discovery, bypassing the challenges of potentially non-convex optimization. We believe that Material Fingerprinting provides a powerful and generalizable framework for rapid material model identification across a wide range of experimental designs and material behaviors, paving the way for numerous future developments.

Title: Master Equation for Quantum Self-Organization of Atoms and Molecules in Cavities
Authors: Tom Schmit, Catalin-Mihai Halati, Tobias Donner, Giovanna Morigi, Simon B. Jäger
Abstract: Quantum gases of atoms and molecules in optical cavities offer a formidable laboratory for studying the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of long-range interacting systems. Multiple scattering of cavity photons mediate interactions, and the emerging phases of matter are determined by the interplay of photon-mediated forces, dissipation, and quantum and thermal fluctuations. Control of these dynamics requires a detailed understanding of the mechanisms at play. Due to the number of degrees of freedom, however, effective theoretical models often work in specific limits, where either the cavity field is treated as a semiclassical variable or the cavity state is a slightly perturbed vacuum state. In this work, we present the derivation of an effective Lindblad master equation for the dynamics of the sole motional variables of polarizable particles, such as atoms or molecules, that dispersively couple to the cavity field. The master equation is valid even for relatively large intracavity photon numbers, and is apt to study both the steady-state regime and the out-of-equilibrium dynamics where quantum fluctuations of the field seed the onset of macroscopic coherences. We validate the theoretical description by showing that it captures the dynamics across a wide temperature interval, from Doppler cooling down to the ultra-cold regime, and from weak to strong cavity-mediated interactions. Our theory provides a powerful framework for the description of the dynamics of quantum gases in cavities and permits, amongst others, to connect models and hypotheses of statistical mechanics with a versatile experimental platform.

Title: Information Transport in Classic-Quantum Hybrid System
Authors: Julian Rapp, Radhika H. Joshi, Alwin van Steensel, Yuli V. Nazarov, Mohammad H. Ansari
Abstract: Many important quantities in quantum information science, such as entropy and entanglement, are non-linear functions of the density matrix and cannot be expressed as operator observables. Standard open-system approaches evolve only a single copy of the density matrix, making it impossible to track the dynamics of such quantities. A formalism proposed by some of the present authors addressed this challenge by evolving multiple virtual replicas, but was limited to the weak-coupling regime. Here, we extend this approach to strong coupling between a quantum system and classical environments. The resulting multi-replica master equation enables direct evaluation of entropy flow and related metrics in strongly hybridized quantum-classical systems. Our results show that quantum coherence and hybridization jointly suppress net entropy transfer, creating a thermodynamic bottleneck. This framework provides a general tool for studying entropy dynamics and guiding the design of more robust, resource-efficient quantum hardware.

Title: Quantum Circuit Complexity of Matrix-Product Unitaries
Authors: Georgios Styliaris, Rahul Trivedi, J. Ignacio Cirac
Abstract: Matrix-product unitaries (MPUs) are many-body unitary operators that, as a consequence of their tensor-network structure, preserve the entanglement area law in 1D systems. However, it is unknown how to implement an MPU as a quantum circuit since the individual tensors describing the MPU are not unitary. In this paper, we show that a large class of MPUs can be implemented with a polynomial-depth quantum circuit. For an $N$-site MPU built from a repeated bulk tensor with open boundary, we explicitly construct a quantum circuit of polynomial depth $T = O(N^{\alpha})$ realizing the MPU, where the constant $\alpha$ depends only on the bulk and boundary tensor and not the system size $N$. We show that this class includes nontrivial unitaries that generate long-range entanglement and, in particular, contains a large class of unitaries constructed from representations of $C^*$-weak Hopf algebras. Furthermore, we also adapt our construction to nonuniform translationally-varying MPUs and show that they can be implemented by a circuit of depth $O(N^{\beta} \, \mathrm{poly}\, D)$ where $\beta \le 1 + \log_2 \sqrt{D}/ s_{\min}$, with $D$ being the bond dimension and $s_{\min}$ is the smallest nonzero Schmidt value of the normalized Choi state corresponding to the MPU.

Title: Atomic thermometry in optical lattice clocks
Authors: Irene Goti, Tommaso Petrucciani, Stefano Condio, Filippo Levi, Davide Calonico, Marco Pizzocaro
Abstract: Accurate measurement of atomic temperature is essential for a wide range of applications, from quantum sensing to precision metrology. In optical lattice clocks, precise characterization of atomic temperature is required to minimize systematic uncertainties at the $10^{-18}$ level. In this work, we investigate atomic temperature measurements in the ytterbium optical lattice clock developed at INRIM, IT-Yb1, employing sideband and Doppler spectroscopy across a wide range of trapping conditions. By implementing clock-line-mediated Sisyphus cooling, we reduce the atomic temperature and enable operation at shallower lattice depths down to $D = 50E_{R}$. We compare temperature estimates obtained from the harmonic oscillator model with those derived using a Born-Oppenheimer-based approach, which is expected to provide a more accurate description of atomic motion in both longitudinal and radial directions, especially for hotter atoms whose motion deviates from the harmonic regime. Discrepancies up to a factor of two in extracted temperatures are observed depending on the chosen model. We assess the impact of these modeling differences on the evaluation of lattice frequency shifts and find deviations up to $8\times10^{-17}$. Even though extended Sisyphus cooling reduces these inconsistencies to the $1\times10^{-18}$ level or below, residual biases may still limit the accuracy of optical lattice clocks.

Title: Fast and efficient long-distance quantum state transfer in long-range spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ models
Authors: F. Faria, C.C. Nelmes, T.J.G. Apollaro, T.P. Spiller, I. D'Amico
Abstract: Quantum state transfer is investigated beyond the nearest-neighbour coupling scheme in long spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ linear chains. Exploiting the properties of the next-nearest neighbour Hamiltonian's dispersion relation, it is shown that with minimal engineering, i.e., an on-site magnetic field on the two end sites and only a few symmetrically-modified end inter-site couplings, an average transfer fidelity above $99\%$ can be achieved. To leading order, the required time scales linearly with the length of the chain. Such a fast, high-quality quantum state transfer is based on the ballistic propagation of the wave packet centred in the linear region of the dispersion relation by means of the on-site magnetic field. At the same time, the wave packet width, modulated by the inter-site couplings at the chain ends, whose values are found via a carefully designed genetic algorithm, is constrained mostly in the linear region of the dispersion relation. Our coupling scheme is shown to hold for arbitrary values of the next-nearest inter-site coupling and can be straightforwardly applied to longer range coupling schemes.

Title: Observation of Metal-Insulator and Spectral Phase Transitions in Aubry-André-Harper Models
Authors: Quan Lin, Christopher Cedzich, Qi Zhou, Peng Xue
Abstract: Non-Hermitian extensions of the Aubry-André-Harper (AAH) model reveal a rich variety of phase transitions arising from the interplay of quasiperiodicity and non-Hermiticity. Despite their theoretical significance, experimental explorations remain challenging due to complexities in realizing controlled non-Hermiticity. Here, we present the first experimental realization of the unitary almost-Mathieu operator (UAMO) which simulates the AAH model by employing single-photon quantum walks. Through precise control of quasiperiodicity, we systematically explore the phase diagram displaying a phase transition between localized and delocalized regimes in the Hermitian limit. Subsequently, by introducing non-reciprocal hopping, we experimentally probe the parity-time (PT) symmetry-breaking transition that is characterized by the emergence of complex quasienergies. Moreover, we identify a novel spectral transition exclusive to discrete-time settings, where all quasienergies become purely imaginary. Both transitions are connected to changes in the spectral winding number, demonstrating their topological origins. These results clarify the interplay between localization, symmetry breaking, and topology in non-Hermitian quasicrystals, paving the way for future exploration of synthetic quantum matter.

Title: Attraction-enhanced emergence of friction in colloidal matter
Authors: Berend van der Meer, Taiki Yanagishima, Roel P. A. Dullens
Abstract: How frictional effects emerge at the microscopic level in particulate materials remains a challenging question, particularly in systems subject to thermal fluctuations due to the transient nature of interparticle contacts. Here, we directly relate particle-level frictional arrest to local coordination in an attractive colloidal model system. We reveal that the orientational dynamics of particles slows down exponentially with increasing coordination number due to the emergence of frictional interactions, the strength of which can be tuned simply by varying the attraction strength. Using a simple computer simulation model, we uncover how the interparticle interactions govern the formation of frictional contacts between particles. Our results establish quantitative relations between friction, coordination and interparticle interactions. This is a key step towards using interparticle friction to tune the mechanical properties of particulate materials.

Title: Robust d-wave superconductivity from the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger-Hubbard model: possible route to high-temperature superconductivity
Authors: Hao-Xin Wang, Yi-Fan Jiang, Hong Yao
Abstract: Increasing numerical studies showed that the simplest Hubbard model on the square lattice with strong repulsion may not exhibit high-temperature superconductivity (SC). It is desired to look for other possible microscopic mechanism of realizing high-temperature SC. Here, we explore the interplay between the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) electron-phonon coupling (EPC) and the Hubbard repulsion by density-matrix-renormalization-group (DMRG) simulations. Our state-of-the-art DMRG study showed convincingly that the interplay between strong Hubbard $U$ and moderate Su-Schrieffer-Heeger EPC $\lambda$ can induce robust $d$-wave SC. The SSH-type EPC can generate effective antiferromagnetic spin-exchange interactions between neighboring sites, which plays a crucial role in the interplay of inducing robust $d$-wave SC. Specifically, for $U=8t$, we find that $d$-wave SC emerges when $\lambda>\lambda_c$ with a moderate critical value $\lambda_c=0.1\sim 0.2$. Our results might shed new light to understanding high-temperature SC in cuprates as well as pave a possible new route in looking for high-temperature SC in other quantum materials with both strong $U$ and moderate $\lambda$.

Title: Interfacial Magnetic Anisotropy of Iron-Adsorbed Ferroelectric Perovskites: First-Principles and Machine Learning Study
Authors: Dameul Jeong, Seoung-Hun Kang, Young-Kyun Kwon
Abstract: The advancement of spin-based devices as a replacement for CMOS technology demands lower spin-switching energy in ferromagnetic (FM) materials. Ferroelectric (FE) materials offer a promising avenue for influencing FM properties, yet the mechanisms driving this interplay remain inadequately understood. In this study, we investigate iron-adsorbed FE ABO$_3$ perovskites using a combination of first-principles calculations and machine learning. Our findings reveal a universal correlation between the magnetic anisotropy energy (MAE) of iron and the induced magnetic dipole moments within the BO$_2$ layer and basal oxygen atoms of ABO$_3$ at the FE/FM interface. By identifying key material descriptors and achieving high predictive accuracy, this research provides a robust framework for selecting and optimizing ABO$_3$ substrates for energy-efficient spintronic devices. These insights contribute to the rational design of novel low-power spin-based technologies.

Title: A15 Phase Ta3Sb Thin Films: Direct Synthesis, Charge Transport and Spin-Orbit Torque
Authors: J. S. Jiang, Qianheng Du, Yi Li, Ulrich Welp, Ramakanta Chapai, Hanu Arava, Yuzi Liu, Yue Li, John Pearson, Ralu Divan, Anand Bhattacharya, Hyowon Park
Abstract: Ta3Sb is one of the A15 compounds that have been predicted to have giant spin Hall conductivities due to the gapped Dirac-like band crossings in their electronic structures. We use co-sputtering to directly synthesize thin films of Ta3Sb and identify a large window of Ta:Sb flux ratio that permits the formation of single-phase A15 structure. These sputtered films have an actual Ta:Sb atomic ratio of 4:1 as determined from Rutherford backscattering spectrometry. Their high resistivity, at the Mott-Ioffe-Regel limit, suggests that the electron mean free path is comparable to interatomic distances. From harmonic Hall and spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance measurements, the intrinsic spin Hall conductivity of thin film Ta3Sb is estimated to be in the range of -526 to -1230 (hbar/e) S/cm at 300 K, lower in magnitude than the predicted value of -1400 (hbar/e) S/cm. First-principles calculations of the electronic structure show that the discrepancy is consistent with an increase of the Fermi level due to the non-ideal stoichiometry needed to stabilize the A15 structure.

Title: Anomalous shift and optical vorticity in the steady photovoltaic current
Authors: Penghao Zhu, A. Alexandradinata
Abstract: Steady illumination of a non-centrosymmetric semiconductor results in a bulk photovoltaic current, which is contributed by real-space displacements (`shifts') of charged quasiparticles as they transit between Bloch states. The shift induced by interband excitation via absorption of photons has received the prevailing attention. However, this excitation-induced shift can be far outweighed ($\ll$) by the shift induced by intraband relaxation, or by the shift induced by radiative recombination of electron-hole pairs. This outweighing ($\ll$) is attributed to (i) time-reversal-symmetric, intraband Berry curvature, which results in an anomalous shift of quasiparticles as they scatter with phonons, as well as to (ii) topological singularities in the interband Berry phase (`optical vortices'), which makes the photovoltaic current extraordinarily sensitive to the linear polarization vector of the light source. Both (i-ii) potentially lead to nonlinear conductivities of order $mAV^{-2}$, without finetuning of the incident radiation frequency, band gap, or joint density of states. A case study of BiTeI showcases the anomalous shift and optical vorticity in a realistic material.

Title: Critical behavior of Fredenhagen-Marcu string order parameters at topological phase transitions with emergent higher-form symmetries
Authors: Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: A nonlocal string order parameter detecting topological order and deconfinement has been proposed by Fredenhagen and Marcu (FM). However, due to the lack of exact internal symmetries for lattice models and the nonlinear dependence of the FM string order parameter on ground states, it is a priori not guaranteed that it is a genuine order parameter for topological phase transitions. In this work, we find that the FM string order parameter exhibits universal scaling behavior near critical points of charge condensation transitions, by directly evaluating the FM string order parameter in the infinite string-length limit using infinite Projected Entangled Pair States (iPEPS) for the toric code in a magnetic field. Our results thus demonstrate that the FM string order parameter represents a quantitatively well-behaved order parameter. We find that only in the presence of an emergent 1-form symmetry the corresponding FM string order parameter can faithfully detect topological transitions.

Title: Quantum Geometric Advantage of the Correlated Exciton State in Non-linear Optics
Authors: MingRui Lai, Fengyuan Xuan, Su Ying Quek
Abstract: The concept of quantum geometry for single-particle states has revolutionized our interpretation of several emergent properties in condensed matter. However, a description of the quantum geometry for interacting particles and an understanding of its implications are lacking. Here, we show that inherent in the non-linear optical response is a quantum geometry of the correlated electron-hole state (exciton) that arises from the interplay between geometry and interactions - distinct from the quantum geometric properties of the individual electron or hole states. We demonstrate using first principles calculations that this quantum many-body geometry significantly enhances the non-linear optical response in systems with strong excitonic effects. In the case of shift currents, the quantum many-body geometric term arises in the many-body shift vector and can be interpreted as a many-body analogue of the Berry phase. This work lays the foundation to study the quantum geometry of correlated states in experimentally observable settings.

Title: AC Josephson Signatures of the Superconducting Higgs/Amplitude Mode
Authors: Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel
Abstract: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs oscillations.

Title: Anisotropic Non-Fermi Liquid and Dynamical Planckian Scaling of a Quasi-Kagome Kondo Lattice System
Authors: Shin-ichi Kimura, Muhammad Frassetia Lubis, Hiroshi Watanabe, Yasuyuki Shimura, Toshiro Takabatake
Abstract: At the quantum critical point of correlated materials, a non-Fermi liquid state appears where electron correlations continuously develop to very low temperatures. The relaxation time of the interacted electrons, namely quasiparticles, is scaled with the Planckian time, $\hbar/k_{\rm B}T$. However, there is a debate over whether heavy-fermion systems can obey the Planckian time. In the optical conductivity spectra, the Drude response will appear as the scaling of $\hbar\omega/k_{\rm B}T$ as the dynamical Planckian scaling (DPS). Here, we report the non-Fermi liquid behavior in the Drude response of a candidate for such materials, the quasi-kagome Kondo lattice CeRhSn. Even though the material shows a strong valence fluctuation, renormalized Drude responses observed at the photon energy below 100 meV are characterized by non-Fermi-liquid-like scattering rate $1/\tau$. The heavy carriers' Drude response only for the Ce quasi-kagome plane obeyed DPS below 80 K, suggesting the anisotropic quantum criticality with the strong $c \textrm{-} f$ hybridization.

Title: Thermal Hall effect and gauge-field picture of magnons in antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals
Authors: Masataka Kawano
Abstract: Quasiparticle excitations in material solids often experience a fictitious gauge field, which can be a potential source of intriguing transport phenomena. Here, we show that low-energy excitations in insulating antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals on the triangular lattice are effectively described by magnons with an SU(3) gauge field. The three-sublattice structure in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals is inherited as three internal degrees of freedom for the magnons, which are coupled to their kinetic motion via the SU(3) gauge field that arises from the topologically nontrivial spin texture in real space. We show that the non-commutativity of the SU(3) gauge field breaks an effective time-reversal symmetry and contributes to a magnon thermal Hall effect. We further demonstrate the emergence of the finite thermal Hall conductivity in the antiferromagnetic skyrmion crystals by the linear spin-wave theory. The possible impact of different gauge structures on a thermal Hall conductivity is also discussed.

Title: Signatures of spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Shuo Wang, Xilin Feng, Jing-Zhi Fang, Jia-Peng Peng, Zi-Ting Sun, Jia-Jie Yang, Jingchao Liu, Jia-Ji Zhao, Jian-Kun Wang, Xin-Jie Liu, Ze-Nan Wu, Shengbiao Sun, Ning Kang, Xiao-Song Wu, Zhensheng Zhang, Xuewen Fu, Kam Tuen Law, Ben-Chuan Lin, Dapeng Yu
Abstract: The study of kagome materials has attracted much attention in the past few years due to the presence of many electron-electron interaction-driven phases in a single material. These include charge density waves, nematic phases, superconducting phases, and pair density waves. In this work, we report the discovery of intrinsic spin-polarized p-wave superconductivity in the thin-flake kagome material RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. Firstly, when an in-plane magnetic field is swept in opposite directions, we observe a unique form of hysteresis in magnetoresistance which is different from the hysteresis induced by extrinsic mechanisms such as flux-trapping or superheating and supercooling effects. The unconventional hysteresis indicates the emergence of an intrinsic time-reversal symmetry-breaking superconducting phase. Strikingly, at a fixed magnetic field, the finite-resistance state can be transitioned into the superconducting state by applying and subsequently removing a large current. Secondly, at temperatures around 400 mK, the re-entrance of superconductivity occurs during an in-plane field-sweeping process. This kind of re-entrance is asymmetric about the zero field axis and observed in all field directions for a fixed current direction, which is different from the re-entrance observed in conventional superconductors. These findings put very strong constraints on the possible superconducting pairing symmetry of RbV$_3$Sb$_5$. We point out that the pairing symmetry, which is consistent with the crystal symmetry and all the observed novel properties, is possibly a time-reversal symmetry-breaking, p-wave pairing with net spin polarization. Importantly, this p-wave pairing gives rise to a nodal topological superconducting state with Majorana flat bands on the sample edges.

Title: Algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect and generalized Fermi surface formula in arbitrary dimensions
Authors: Kai Zhang, Chang Shu, Kai Sun
Abstract: The non-Hermitian skin effect, characterized by a proliferation of exponentially localized edge modes in open-boundary systems, has led to the discovery of numerous novel physical phenomena that challenge the limits of conventional band theory. In sharp contrast to this familiar exponential localization, we report a distinct phenomenon--the algebraic non-Hermitian skin effect--which arises generically in non-Hermitian systems with two or more spatial dimensions. In such cases, the amplitude of skin modes typically decays from the boundary following a power law, rather than an exponential form--a behavior not captured by existing theoretical frameworks. To bridge this gap and describe the transition in localization from one to higher dimensions, we develop a generalized Fermi surface framework applicable to open-boundary systems in arbitrary dimensions. This framework not only reproduces known results for the exponential skin effect in 1D, but also predicts a new class of skin effects with algebraic decay in 2D and above. We demonstrate this framework in both tight-binding and continuum models in two and three dimensions. This investigation not only unveils a novel category of the non-Hermitian skin effect but also offers a comprehensive theoretical structure that describes skin effects in any non-Hermitian system, irrespective of its spatial dimensionality.

Title: Emergent Universal Drag Law in a Model of Superflow
Authors: Maarten T.M. Christenhusz, Arghavan Safavi-Naini, Halina Rubinsztein-Dunlop, Tyler W. Neely, Matthew T. Reeves
Abstract: Despite the fundamentally different dissipation mechanisms, many laws and phenomena of classical turbulence equivalently manifest in quantum turbulence. The Reynolds law of dynamical similarity states that two objects of same geometry across different length scales are hydrodynamically equivalent under the same Reynolds number, leading to a universal drag coefficient law. In this work we confirm the existence of a universal drag law in a superfluid wake, facilitated by the nucleation of quantized vortices. We numerically study superfluid flow across a range of Reynolds numbers for the paradigmatic classical hard-wall and the Gaussian obstacle, popular in experimental quantum hydrodynamics. In addition, we provide a feasible method for measuring superfluid drag forces in an experimental environment using control volumes.

Title: Topological superconductivity in superconducting chiral topological semimetals with parallel spin-momentum locking
Authors: Yingyi Huang
Abstract: In contrast to conventional Weyl semimetals in achiral crystals, chiral topological semimetals in chiral crystals exhibit Weyl nodes at time-reversal-invariant momenta. A Fermi surface spin texture with parallel spin-momentum locking in these material has been observed by a recent experiment [Nat. Comm. 15,3720(2024)]. We find that the Weyl nodes location and the Fermi surface spin texture lead to gapped zero-momenta intranode superconductivity (SC), which is absent in achiral Weyl semimetals. Through self-consistent mean-field calculations, we find that a cubic lattice system in general favors a mixture of spin-singlet $s_\pm$ and $d+id$-wave pairings. In the presence of only the $s_\pm$-wave pairing, we identify a first-order time-reversal invariant topological SC phase. Notably, an SC phase with two Majorana cones for opened Fermi surfaces is energetically favorable. In addition, a second-order topological superconductor with chiral Majorana states can be realized in the presence of a mixture of $s\pm$- and $d+id$-wave pairing. We show that chiral topological semimetals in cubic lattice are fascinating platforms for exploring intrinsic unconventional superconductivity and topological superconductivity.

Title: Josephson Traveling Wave Parametric Amplifiers with Plasma oscillation phase-matching
Authors: Emil Rizvanov, Samuel Kern, Pavol Neilinger, Miroslav Grajcar
Abstract: High gain and large bandwidth of traveling-wave parametric amplifier exploiting the nonlinearity of Josephson Junctions can be achieved by fulfilling the so-called phase-matching condition. This condition is usually addressed by placing resonant structures along the waveguide or by periodic modulations of its parameters, creating gaps in the waveguide's dispersion. Here, we propose to employ the Josephson junctions, which constitute the centerline of the amplifier, as resonant elements for phase matching. By numerical simulations in JoSIM (and WRspice) software, we show that Josephson plasma oscillations can be utilized to create wavevector mismatch sufficient for phase matching as well as to prevent the conversion of the pump energy to higher harmonics. The proposed TWPA design has a gain of 15 dB and a 3.5 GHz bandwidth, which is comparable to the state-of-the-art TWPAs.

Title: Spin Seebeck effect of interacting spinons
Authors: Ren-Bo Wang, Naveen Nishad, Anna Keselman, Leon Balents, Oleg A. Starykh
Abstract: We present the theory of the longitudinal spin Seebeck effect between a Heisenberg spin-1/2 chain and a conductor. The effect consists of the generation of a spin current across the spin chain-conductor interface in response to the temperature difference between the two systems. In this setup, the current is given by the convolution of the local spin susceptibilities of the spin chain and the conductor. We find the spin current to be fully controlled, both in the magnitude and the sign, by the backscattering interaction between spinons, fractionalized spin excitations of the Heisenberg chain. In particular, it vanishes when the spinons form a non-interacting spinon gas. Our analytical results for the local spin susceptibility at the open end of the spin chain are in excellent agreement with numerical DMRG simulations.

Title: Stochastic cloaking: concealing a region from diffusive particles
Authors: Connor Roberts, Ziluo Zhang, Helder Rojas, Stefano Bo, Carlos Escudero, Sebastien Guenneau, Gunnar Pruessner
Abstract: We introduce "stochastic cloaking," where a region of space is concealed from an ensemble of diffusing particles whose individual trajectories are governed by a stochastic (Langevin) equation. Our simulations reveal how different interpretations of the Langevin equation affect the cloaking performance of an annular single-layer invisibility cloak of smoothly varying diffusivity in two dimensions. Near-perfect cloaking is achieved under the Ito convention, indicated by the cloak preventing particles from accessing an inner core without disturbing the particle density outside the cloak. The cloak's performance can be further improved by regularising its singular behaviour. We believe our demonstration of stochastic cloaking is a significant milestone, comparable to earlier developments that extended cloaking from optics and acoustics to thermodynamics.

Title: Optimizing defect states in $(Bi_{0.3}Sb_{0.7})_{2}Te_{3}$ ternary topological insulators using indium doping
Authors: Kanav Sharma, Ritam Banerjee, Anuvab Nandi, Radha Krishna Gopal, Chiranjib Mitra
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of indium doping on the defect states in (Bi0.3Sb0.7)2Te3 (BST) ternary topological insulators. Thin (10 nm) and thick (60 nm) films of pristine BST and indium-doped BST (In0.14(Bi0.3Sb0.7)1.86Te3) were synthesized using pulsed laser deposition. The electronic properties were characterized through low-frequency noise spectroscopy and temperature-dependent resistance (R-T) measurements. For the 10 nm films, R-T analysis revealed that indium doping shifts the thermal activation energy by approximately 100 meV. This doping also suppresses a shallow impurity band at 72 meV, a finding corroborated by 1/f noise measurements. In the 60 nm films, noise spectroscopy was used to probe deep defect states, where indium doping was found to increase the activation energy from 292.3 meV to 392 meV -- a consistent shift of 100 meV. These findings demonstrate that indium doping is an effective method for systematically modifying both shallow and deep defect states, enhancing the insulating properties and offering a mechanism to engineer the electronic behavior of topological insulators for advanced electronic applications where noise reduction is crucial.

Title: Low-energy optical absorption in correlated insulators: Projected sum rules and the role of quantum geometry
Authors: Dan Mao, Juan Felipe Mendez-Valderrama, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: Inspired by the discovery of a variety of correlated insulators in the moiré universe, controlled by interactions projected to a set of isolated bands with a narrow bandwidth, we examine here a partial sum-rule associated with the inverse frequency-weighted optical conductivity restricted to low-energies. Unlike standard sum-rules that extend out to $infinite$ frequencies, which include contributions from $all$ inter-band transitions, we focus here on transitions associated $only$ with the $projected$ degrees of freedom. We analyze the partial sum-rule in a non-perturbative but "solvable" limit for a variety of correlation-induced insulators. This includes (i) magic-angle twisted bilayer graphene at integer-filling with projected Coulomb interactions, starting from the chiral flat-band limit and including realistic perturbations, (ii) fractional fillings of Chern-bands which support generalized Laughlin-like states, starting from a Landau-level and including a periodic potential and magnetic-field, respectively, drawing connections to twisted MoTe$_2$, and (iii) integer filling in toy-models of non-topological flat-bands with a tunable quantum geometry in the presence of repulsive interactions. The partial sum-rule in all of these examples is implicitly constrained by the form of the band quantum geometry via the low-lying excitation spectrum, but is not related to it explicitly. For interacting Slater-determinant insulators, the partial sum-rule is related to a new quantity -- "many-body projected quantum geometry" -- obtained from the interaction-renormalized electronic bands. We also point out an intriguing connection between the partial sum-rule and the quantum Fisher information associated with the projected many-body position operator.

Title: Unified percolation scenario for the $α$ and $β$ processes in simple glass formers
Authors: Liang Gao, Hai-Bin Yu, Thomas B. Schrøder, Jeppe C. Dyre
Abstract: Given the vast differences in interaction details, describing the dynamics of structurally disordered materials in a unified theoretical framework presents a fundamental challenge to condensed-matter physics and materials science. Here, we numerically investigate a double-percolation scenario for the two most important relaxation processes of supercooled liquids and glasses, the so-called alpha and beta relaxations. For several simple glass formers, we find that when monitoring the dynamic shear modulus as temperature is lowered from the liquid state, percolation of immobile particles takes place at the temperature locating the alpha process. Mirroring this, upon continued cooling into the glass state, the mobile-particle percolation transition pinpoints a beta process whenever the latter is well separated from the main (alpha) process. For two-dimensional systems under the same conditions, percolation of mobile and immobile particles occurs nearly simultaneously and no beta relaxation can be identified. Our findings suggest that a general description of glassy dynamics should be based on a percolation perspective.

Title: Tuning the band topology and topological Hall effect in skyrmion crystals via the spin-orbit coupling
Authors: Arijit Mandal, S. Satpathy, B.R.K. Nanda
Abstract: The topological Hall effect is the result of spin-asymmetric deflection of charge carriers flowing through a non-collinear spin system. Effective manipulation of the topological Hall conductivity (THC) in skyrmions is currently a vigorous area of research with an eye towards potential spintronics application. Here, we show that the band topology and the THC in a skyrmion crystal can be tuned by changing the strength of the Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which can be accomplished via a perpendicular electric field. This results in the change of the subband Chern numbers and a transition between ordinary insulator and Chern insulator as the Rashba SOC is varied. For partially filled subbands, the Rashba SOC can tune the THC and reverse its sign, so that the direction of the Hall current is flipped. The critical Rashba strength for this depends on the skyrmion type and the carrier density. We extend our analysis to the cases of Dresselhaus and Weyl SOC as well, and show that they can be directly mapped to the Rashba SOC case and therefore lead to similar results. Our work opens up the scope to go beyond the existing avenues for the control of charge transport in skyrmion crystals.

Title: Coarsening and universality on a growing surface
Authors: Robert J. H. Ross, Simone Pigolotti
Abstract: We introduce a model in which cells belonging to two species proliferate with volume exclusion on an expanding surface. If the surface expands uniformly, we show that the domains formed by the two species present a critical behavior. We compute the critical exponents characterizing the decay of interfaces and the size distribution of domains using a mean-field theory. These mean-field exponents agree very accurately with those fitted in numerical simulations, suggesting that the theory is exact.

Title: Anomalous Temperature Induced Transition and Convergence of Thermal Conductivity in Germanene Monolayer
Authors: Sapta Sindhu Paul Chowdhury, Sourav Thapliyal, Santosh Mogurampelly
Abstract: We report an anomalous temperature-induced transition in thermal conductivity in germanene monolayer around a critical temperature $T_c = 350 \, \text{K}$. Equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations reveal a transition from $\kappa \sim T^{-2}$ scaling below $T_c$ to $\kappa \sim T^{-1/2}$ above, contrasting with conventional $\kappa \sim T^{-1}$ behavior. This anomalous scaling correlates with the long-scale characteristic timescale $\tau_2$ obtained from double exponential fitting of the heat current autocorrelation function. Phonon mode analysis using normal mode decomposition indicates that a redshift in ZO phonons reduces the acoustic-optical phonon gap, causing an overlap, enhances the phonon-phonon scattering, driving the anomalous scaling behavior. Moreover, nonequilibrium simulations find a convergent thermal conductivity of germanene with sample size, in agreement with mode coupling theory, owing to the high scattering of ZA phonons due to the inherent buckling of germanene.

Title: Diffusion-Controlled Anion Conversion into Dense Polycrystalline and Single-Crystalline Oxyhydrides
Authors: Masaya Fujioka, Mihiro Hoshino, Suguru Iwasaki, Katsuhiro Nomura, Aman Sharma, Mineyuki Hattori, Zhongxu Hu, Takayoshi Katase, Reina Utsumi, Yuki Nakahira, Hiroyuki Saitoh
Abstract: Oxyhydrides represent a new class of functional materials, yet the synthesis of dense polycrystals or single-crystals suitable for transport studies remains a significant challenge due to hydrogen desorption at elevated temperatures. The co-diffusion of oxygen and hydrogen in densely sintered BaTiO3 enables the topochemical formation of millimeter-scale bulk BaTiO3-xHx via high-pressure diffusion control (HPDC). Hydride ions selectively occupy oxygen-deficient sites, as confirmed by neutron diffraction, TPD, TG, and NMR. Systematic tuning of the hydrogen content and precise control of the electronic conductivity were achieved via HPDC. Hydrogen desorption analysis reveals distinct bonding states between near-surface and interior-bulk regions, which significantly affect the oxynitride conversion under N2 flow. Importantly, the diffusion-based nature of HPDC allows direct anion conversion even in single-crystalline oxides, as demonstrated by the synthesis of SrTiO3-xHx single crystals. These results establish HPDC as a general platform for accessing dense, metastable oxyhydrides with tunable anionic composition and transport properties.

Title: On the Wiedemann-Franz law violation in Graphene and quark-gluon plasma systems
Authors: Ashutosh Dwibedi, Subhalaxmi Nayak, Sathe Subodh Kiran, Sabyasachi Ghosh, Sesha Vempati
Abstract: A comparative study of the thermodynamic and transport properties of the ultra-relativistic quark-gluon plasma produced in heavy ion collisions with the "quasi-relativistic" massless electron-hole plasma in graphene sample has been performed. We observe that the enthalpy per net charge carriers emerges as a useful physical quantity determining the transport variables in hydrodynamic domain. Lorenz ratio is defined as thermal to electrical conductivity ratio, normalized by temperature and Lorenz number $L_{0}=\frac{\pi^{2}}{3}\left(\frac{k_{B}}{e}\right)^{2}$. The validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law can be checked by evaluating the Lorenz ratio, which is expected to be unity. We investigate the validity of the Wiedemann-Franz law by examining whether the Lorenz ratio equals unity or deviates from it. Our findings indicate that, within the fluid-based framework, the Lorenz ratio consistently leads to a violation of the Wiedemann-Franz law. This is attributed to the proportional relation between Lorenz ratio and enthalpy per net charge carriers in the fluid. Based on the experimental observation, graphene and quark-gluon plasma, both systems at a low net carrier density, violate the Wiedemann-Franz law due to their fluidic nature. However, graphene at a relatively high net carrier density obeys the Wiedemann-Franz law, followed by metals with high Fermi energy or electron density. It indicates a fluid to the non-fluid transition of the graphene system from low to high carrier density. In this regard, the fluid or non-fluid aspect of quark-gluon plasma at high density is yet to be explored by future facilities like Compressed Baryonic Matter and Nuclotron-based Ion Collider fAcility experiments.

Title: Optical signatures of Euler superconductors
Authors: Chun Wang Chau, Wojciech J. Jankowski, Robert-Jan Slager
Abstract: We study optical manifestations of multigap band topology in multiband superconductors with a nontrivial topological Euler class. We introduce a set of lattice models for non-Abelian superconductors with the Euler invariant signified by a nontrivial quantum geometry. We then demonstrate that the topological Bogoliubov excitations realized in these models provide for a characteristic first-order optical response distinct from those of the other known topological superconductors. We find that the spectral distribution of the optical conductivity universally admits a topological jump originating from the Euler class in the presence of $d$-wave superconducting pairings, and naturally differs from the features induced by the quantum geometry in the noninteracting bands without pairing terms. Further to uncovering observable signatures in first-order optical conductivities, we showcase that the higher-order optical responses of the non-Abelian Euler superconductor can result in enhanced nonlinear currents that fingerprint the exotic topological invariant. Finally, by employing a diagrammatic approach, we generalize our findings beyond the specific models of Euler superconductors.

Title: Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics
Authors: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization; equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescale. This is due to their identical local electronic structures guided by the underlying symmetries. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we demonstrate that laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization dynamics of identical sublattices in the d-wave compensated altermagnet RuO2, resulting in a photo-induced ferrimagnetic state with a net moment of ~0.2 {\mu}B per unit cell. This metastable magnetization is highly controllable; depends on the direction of the linear polarized laser. We identify the underlying mechanism as an anisotropic optical-induced intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) effect, originating from the momentum-dependent spin splitting unique to altermagnets. This a-OISTR effect enables the polarization of light to drive direction-selective transient spin-dependent currents between sublattices, leading to a controllable ultrafast magnetic state transition in AM. These findings uncover novel laser-driven pathways to control magnetic order in altermagnets, enabling a phase transition from AM to ferrimagnetic state.

Title: Multiphysics simulations of microstructure influence on hysteresis and eddy current losses of electrical steel
Authors: Patrick Kühn, Yangyiwei Yang, Guanyu Chen, Shanelle N. Foster, Herbert Egger, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Improving efficiency of electrical machines requires fundamental knowledge on the mechanisms behind magnetic and eddy current losses of the magnetic core materials, with Fe-Si alloy as a prototype. These losses are intrinsically influenced by the microstructure of the materials. This necessitates physics-based, microstructure-informed multiscale simulations. In the present paper, we utilised micromagnetic simulations and computational homogenization methods to calculate the effective hysteresis and effective conductivities of Fe-Si electrical steels. To demonstrate the methodology, binder-jet printed electrical steel material samples with different microstructure were investigated. The microstructure samples were digitized based on both the descriptor-based synthetic reconstruction and SEM-image-based digitization. More samples were generated with varying microstructure features such as grain size and grain boundary phases. The micromagnetic simulations were then performed to investigate the magnetic hysteresis and hysteresis loss. The eddy current loss was also evaluated by using the effective conductivity through computational homogenization. By performing parameter research on a series of synthetic microstructures, effects of average grain size and grain boundary (GB) phase thickness on the hysteresis loss and eddy current loss were unveiled. An average grain size around 120 \si{\micro m} has the lowest hysteresis loss, although the eddy current loss increases with the grain size. Increasing GB-phase thickness helps reduce both losses. Results indicate the potential to decrease loss of magnetic core materials by microstructure optimization.

Title: Complex entanglement entropy for complex conformal field theory
Authors: Haruki Shimizu, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Conformal field theory underlies critical ground states of quantum many-body systems. While conventional conformal field theory is associated with positive central charges, nonunitary conformal field theory with complex-valued central charges has recently been recognized as physically relevant. Here, we demonstrate that complex-valued entanglement entropy characterizes complex conformal field theory and critical phenomena of open quantum many-body systems. This is based on non-Hermitian reduced density matrices constructed from the combination of right and left ground states. Applying the density matrix renormalization group to non-Hermitian systems, we numerically calculate the complex entanglement entropy of the non-Hermitian five-state Potts model, thereby confirming the scaling behavior predicted by complex conformal field theory.

Title: Electronic structure fingerprints of visible-range excitons in $d^0$ double perovskite oxides
Authors: Bhagyashree Behera, Debatri Ash, Urmimala Dey, M. K. Roy, Pritha Patra, K. Annapurna, S. K. Rout, Ajay K Himanshu, Rajyavardhan Ray
Abstract: Presence of excitons significantly influence the optoelectronic properties and potential applications of materials. Using combined theoretical and experimental tools, we investigate the absorption spectra of $d^0$ double perovskite oxides Ba$_{2}$Y$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Nb, Ta, Sb), Ba$_{2}$Sc$B'$O$_6$ ($B'$ = Ta, Sb) and $A_{2}$ScSbO$_6$ ($A$=Ca, Sr, Ba), allowing for a systematic variation of composition. We not only show that low-energy excitons possessing large binding energies up to 3 eV are present in the visible range in all the considered wide-gap insulators, but also that the nature and properties of these excitons differs from those in double perovskite halides as well as perovskite oxides. We provide insights on the origin of such differences by a comparative analysis of the electronic structure. Our findings elucidate possible correlations between the exciton properties and the composition, via the electronic structure, towards a comprehensive understanding of correlation effects and rational design principles.

Title: High-dimensional random landscapes: from typical to large deviations
Authors: Valentina Ros
Abstract: In these notes we discuss tools and concepts that emerge when studying high-dimensional random landscapes, i.e., random functions on high-dimensional spaces. As an illustrative example, we consider an inference problem in two forms: low-rank matrix estimation (Case 1) and low-rank tensor estimation (Case 2). We show how to map the inference problem onto the optimization problem of a high-dimensional landscape, which exhibits distinct geometrical properties in the two cases. We discuss methods for characterizing typical realizations of these landscapes and their optimization through local dynamics. We conclude by highlighting connections between the landscape problem and Large Deviation Theory.

Abstract: Neutron diffraction experiments of TmFeO3 single crystals were performed in the external magnetic fields. The field along c-axis increases temperature of spin-reorientation transition TSR from phase {\Gamma}4 to {\Gamma}2. Application of the field along b-axis led to the decrease of TSR and to the formation of new phases. Based on the temperature and field dependence of the Bragg reflection intensity, the configuration of magnetically induced phases was proposed. The magneto-structural effects were observed.

Title: PFD: Automatically Generating Machine Learning Force Fields from Universal Models
Authors: Ruoyu Wang, Yuxiang Gao, Hongyu Wu, Zhicheng Zhong
Abstract: Universal force fields generalizable across the periodic table represent a new trend in computational materials science. However, the applications of universal force fields in material simulations are limited by their slow inference speed and the lack of first-principles accuracy. Instead of building a single model simultaneously satisfying these characteristics, a strategy that quickly generates material-specific models from the universal model may be more feasible. Here, we propose a new workflow pattern, PFD, which automatically generates machine-learning force fields for specific materials from a pre-trained universal model through fine-tuning and distillation. By fine-tuning the pre-trained model, our PFD workflow generates force fields with first-principles accuracy while requiring one to two orders of magnitude less training data compared to traditional methods. The inference speed of the generated force field is further improved through distillation, meeting the requirements of large-scale molecular simulations. Comprehensive testing across diverse materials including complex systems such as amorphous carbon, interface, etc., reveals marked enhancements in training efficiency, which suggests the PFD workflow a practical and reliable approach for force field generation in computational material sciences.

Title: Quantum effects on pyrochlore higher-rank U(1) spin liquids: Pinch-line singularities, spin nematics, and connections to oxide materials
Authors: Lasse Gresista, Daniel Lozano-Gómez, Matthias Vojta, Simon Trebst, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Motivated by the magnetism of pyrochlore oxides, we consider the effect of quantum fluctuations in the most general symmetry-allowed nearest-neighbor Kramers exchange Hamiltonian on the pyrochlore lattice. At the classical level, this Hamiltonian exhibits a rich landscape of classical spin liquids and a variety of nonconventional magnetic phases. In contrast, much remains unclear for the quantum model, where quantum fluctuations have the potential to alter the classical landscape and stabilize novel magnetic phases. Employing state-of-the-art pseudo-fermion functional renormalization group calculations for the spin-$1/2$ model, we determine the quantum phase diagram at relevant cross-sections, where the classical model hosts an algebraic nodal rank-2 spin liquid and a spin nematic order. We find large regions in parameter space on which dipolar magnetic order is absent and, based on known fingerprints in the correlation functions, we suggest that this nonconventional region is composed of an ensemble of distinct phases stabilized by quantum fluctuations. Our results hint at the existence of a spin nematic phase, and we identify the quantum analog of the classical rank-2 spin liquid. Furthermore, we highlight the importance of assessing the subtle interplay of quantum and thermal fluctuations in reconciling the experimental findings on the nature of magnetic order in Yb$_2$Ti$_2$O$_7$.

Title: Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions
Authors: Yao Luo, Dhruv Mangtani, Shiyu Peng, Jia Yao, Sergei Kliavinek, Marco Bernardi
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with >98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, TiNiSn and monoclinic ZrO$_2$). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.

Title: Shear-Rate Dependent Surface Tension of Glass-Forming Fluids
Authors: Linnea Heitmeier, Thomas Voigtmann
Abstract: We investigate the interface of a glass-forming fluid showing non-Newtonian rheology. By applying shear flow in the interface, we detect that the surface tension depends on the shear rate. Importantly, the standard way of determining surface tension from the pressure drop across the interface gives rise to an effective surface tension in the non-Newtonian fluid that mixes bulk and interface properties. We show how the pressure anisotropy can be used to clearly define the bulk and interface regions and extract a genuine shear-rate dependent surface tension. The results have implications for measurement techniques related to interfacial rheology of complex fluids.

Title: Formulation of spin Nernst effect for spin-nonconserving insulating magnets
Authors: Shinnosuke Koyama, Joji Nasu
Abstract: The spin Nernst effect, an antisymmetric response of a spin current to a temperature gradient, has attracted attention as spin transport phenomenon arising from the topologically nontrivial band structure of carriers. This effect can occur not only in itinerant electron systems but also in localized electron systems that emerge due to electronic correlations. In such systems, elementary excitations behaving as bosons govern spin transport, and magnetic interactions originating from spin-orbit coupling can induce a topologically nontrivial band structure. However, such magnetic interactions can potentially break spin conservation, thereby preventing conventional spin currents from being conserved. In this study, starting from a general localized electron model, we formulate the spin Nernst effect in terms of a conserved spin current that remains applicable even in spin-nonconserving systems. To address the torque term appearing in the conserved spin current, we adopt semiclassical theory and derive an expression for the spin Nernst coefficient for bosonic systems. This coefficient consists of two terms originating from the Berry curvature and the quantum metric, which are distinctly different from the spin Berry curvature obtained in an approach that neglects the torque term. We apply our framework to two specific quantum spin models, the Kitaev-Heisenberg and Shastry-Sutherland models, and calculate the temperature dependence of the spin Nernst coefficient. We find that this quantity significantly differs from that obtained by neglecting the torque term in both models. Furthermore, we clarify that the impact of the torque term on the spin Nernst effect strongly depends on the model parameters, suggesting that our formulation based on the conserved spin current is essential for understanding this effect in insulating magnets.

Title: Atomic Altermagnetism
Authors: Rodrigo Jaeschke-Ubiergo, Venkata-Krishna Bharadwaj, Warlley Campos, Ricardo Zarzuela, Nikolaos Biniskos, Rafael M. Fernandes, Tomas Jungwirth, Jairo Sinova, Libor Šmejkal
Abstract: Altermagnetism has been recently experimentally verified by photoemission mapping of the spin order in momentum space in MnTe and CrSb, which feature two anisotropic sublattices with antiparallel magnetic dipole moments. In this work, we explicitly demonstrate the presence of an even-parity ferroically ordered non-dipolar spin density on the atomic sites, i.e. atomic altermagnetism, in MnTe, $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$. We do so through spin-symmetry analysis and partial-wave decomposition of the spin density obtained by first-principles calculations. In MnTe we show a ferroically ordered g-wave form factor in the spin density around the Mn site. In the $A_2O_3M_2Se_2$ family (A= La, Sr and M= Mn, Fe, Co), we show that there is a ferroically ordered d-wave form factor coexisting with the antiferroic magnetic dipoles in the M site, while the O site shows no dipole but a pure d-wave atomic spin density. In the Mott-insulating candidate $Ba_2CaOsO_6$, as a key result, we reveal a pure form of atomic altermagnetism - absent of any dipolar sublattice order. This highlights that the altermagnetic order can exist without a Néel vector formed by antiferroic dipole moments on an even number of crystal sublattices, underlining its distinction from collinear Néel antiferromagnetic order. Our calculations predict that $La_2O_3Mn_2Se_2$ and $Ba_2CaOsO_6$ can exhibit giant spin-splitter angles of up to 42° and 26° respectively, thus demonstrating the possibility of large altermagnetic responses without requiring the staggered Néel order of local dipole moments.

Title: Impact of structural distortions on the correlated electronic structure of orbital-selective Mott insulating Na$_3$Co$_2$SbO$_6$ under strains
Authors: Nam Nguyen, Alex Taekyung Lee, Anh T. Ngo, Hyowon Park
Abstract: Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is a promising candidate to realize the Kitaev spin liquid phase since the large Kitaev spin exchange interaction is tunable via the change in electronic structure, such as the trigonal crystal field splitting ($\Delta_{TCF}$). Here, we show that the uncorrelated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is rather insensitive to the strain effect due to the low crystal symmetry accompanied by oxygen displacements and the presence of Sb $s$ orbitals. This suggests that the Kitaev spin-exchange interaction obtained from perturbation theory also does not depend much on the strain effect. Using density functional theory plus dynamical mean field theory, we find that the correlated electronic structure of Na$_{3}$Co$_{2}$SbO$_6$ is an orbital selective Mott insulating state where the trigonal $a_{1g}$ orbital is insulating due to correlation-assisted hybridization, while other $d$ orbitals behave as typical Mott insulators, resulting in tunability of $\Delta_{TCF}$ under the strain effect effectively. Our results show that the local Co-site symmetry and dynamical correlation effects will play an important role in engineering the novel magnetic phase in this and related materials.

Title: Evolving transport properties of dynamic hydrogels enable self-tuning of short- and long-term cargo delivery
Authors: Samya Sen, Changxin Dong, Carolyn K. Jons, Wencke Reineking, Alakesh Alakesh, Ye Eun Song, Alexander N. Prossnitz, Eric A. Appel
Abstract: Hydrogels are crosslinked polymer networks with high water content, widely employed in biomedical applications such as drug delivery, tissue engineering, and regenerative medicine. Injectable, depot-forming hydrogels enable sustained release of therapeutic agents by modulating macromolecular diffusion through dynamic polymer networks. However, achieving reliable control over release kinetics remains a challenge, as the injection process induces shear-mediated disruption of transient crosslinks, leading to an initial burst release that can cause local toxicity and compromise therapeutic efficacy. Here, we present a hydrogel formulation strategy designed to restore network structure post-injection through rapid reformation of dynamic crosslinks, enabling time-dependent regulation of diffusion properties. By tuning viscoelastic parameters, including stress relaxation time and network recovery rate, we reduced the extent of burst release without compromising sustained delivery. Using model protein cargo, we demonstrate in both $in~vitro$ and $in~vivo$ settings that hydrogels with faster crosslink reformation kinetics exhibit significantly lower early-phase release while maintaining long-term delivery comparable to unmodified formulations. These results establish a mechanistic framework for decoupling short- and long-term release behavior, offering a broadly applicable strategy for precise drug delivery in soft tissue environments.

Title: Data-driven Azimuthal RHEED construction for in-situ crystal growth characterization
Authors: Abdourahman Khaireh-Walieh, Alexandre Arnoult, Sébastien Plissard, Peter R. Wiecha
Abstract: Reflection High-Energy Electron Diffraction (RHEED) is a powerful tool to probe the surface reconstruction during MBE growth. However, raw RHEED patterns are difficult to interpret, especially when the wafer is rotating. A more accessible representation of the information is therefore the so-called Azimuthal RHEED (ARHEED), an angularly resolved plot of the electron diffraction pattern during a full wafer rotation. However, ARHEED requires precise information about the rotation angle as well as of the position of the specular spot of the electron beam. We present a Deep Learning technique to automatically construct the Azimuthal RHEED from bare RHEED images, requiring no further measurement equipment. We use two artificial neural networks: an image segmentation model to track the center of the specular spot and a regression model to determine the orientation of the crystal with respect to the incident electron beam of the RHEED system. Our technique enables accurate, and potentially real-time ARHEED construction on any growth chamber equipped with a RHEED system.

Title: Exchangeless braiding of Majorana zero modes in weakly coupled Kitaev chains
Authors: Robin Quade, Michael Potthoff
Abstract: Exchangeless braiding of Majorana modes is studied in minimal networks of weakly hybridized Kitaev chains of finite length using a rigorous many-body framework. In particular, for two coupled chains it is shown that exchangeless braiding is achieved by $2\pi$ rotations of the phase $\phi$ of the superconducting order parameter of one of the chains. This braiding protocol is verified by the numerical calculation of the non-Abelian Wilczek-Zee phase of the low-energy many-body subspaces ${\cal H}_{0}(\phi)$ based on the Bertsch-Robledo ground-state overlap formula. In the parameter space spanned by the total chain length, the strength of the weak hybridization connecting the chains, and the on-site potential, we identify two regions with different braiding outcomes, i.e., a projective $\sigma_{x}$-gate and a projective $\sigma_{z}$-gate phase. The transition between these phases is a continuous crossover, the location of which is reliably given by a simple four-Majorana mode model. This demonstrates the resilience of the anyonic properties of the Majorana modes against finite-size effects and weak links between Kitaev chains.

Title: Accurate Gauge-Invariant Tensor Network Simulations for Abelian Lattice Gauge Theory in (2+1)D: ground state and real-time dynamics
Authors: Yantao Wu, Wen-Yuan Liu
Abstract: We propose a novel tensor network method to achieve accurate and efficient simulations of Abelian lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in (2+1)D for both ground state and real-time dynamics. The first key is to identify a gauge canonical form (GCF) of gauge-invariant tensor network states, which already simplifies existing algorithms for (1+1)D LGTs. The second key is to employ the GCF of projected entangled-pair state (PEPS) combining with variational Monte Carlo (VMC), enabling efficient computations for (2+1)D LGTs. We demonstrate the versatile capability of this approach for accurate ground state simulation of pure $Z_2$, $Z_3$ and $Z_4$ gauge theory, odd-$Z_2$ gauge theories, and $Z_2$ gauge theory coupled to hard-core bosons, on square lattices up to $32 \times 32$. Furthermore, we demonstrate that it allows for accurate simulations of real-time dynamics up to long-time, exemplified by the dynamics of elementary excitations of the deconfined $Z_2$ gauge field on a $10\times10$ lattice. This is also the first example of using VMC to simulate the real-time dynamics of PEPS, whose impact may extend beyond gauge theory.

Title: Quantitative approaches for multi-scale structural analysis with atomic resolution electron microscopy
Authors: Noah Schnitzer, Lopa Bhatt, Ismail El Baggari, Robert Hovden, Benjamin H. Savitzky, Michelle A. Smeaton, Berit H. Goodge
Abstract: Atomic-resolution imaging with scanning transmission electron microscopy is a powerful tool for characterizing the nanoscale structure of materials, in particular features such as defects, local strains, and symmetry-breaking distortions. In addition to advanced instrumentation, the effectiveness of the technique depends on computational image analysis to extract meaningful features from complex datasets recorded in experiments, which can be complicated by the presence of noise and artifacts, small or overlapping features, and the need to scale analysis over large representative areas. Here, we present image analysis approaches which synergize real and reciprocal space information to efficiently and reliably obtain meaningful structural information with picometer scale precision across hundreds of nanometers of material from atomic-resolution electron microscope images. Damping superstructure peaks in reciprocal space allows symmetry-breaking structural distortions to be disentangled from other sources of inhomogeneity and measured with high precision. Real space fitting of the wave-like signals resulting from Fourier filtering enables absolute quantification of lattice parameter variations and strain, as well as the uncertainty associated with these measurements. Implementations of these algorithms are made available as an open source Python package.

Title: Wigner distribution, Wigner entropy, and Anomalous Transport of a Generalized Aubry-André model
Authors: Feng Lu, Ao Zhou, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: We investigate generalized Aubry-André models featuring tunable quasidisordered potentials and a mobility edge that separates extended and localized states, with critical states for the mobility edge confirmed through finite-size scaling analysis. Numerical results demonstrate that extended, critical, and localized states can be distinguished via their phase-space representations, particularly the Wigner distribution. The associated Wigner entropy, derived from this distribution, peaks at the critical state, enabling precise localization of the mobility edge. Additionally, wave-packet dynamics reveal anomalous transport behaviors, including superdiffusion and subdiffusion, bridging ballistic transport and the absence of diffusion.

Title: Valley Splitting Correlations Across a Silicon Quantum Well

Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.

Title: Persistent Homology-Based Indicator of Orientational Ordering in Two-Dimensional Quasi-Particle Systems applied to Skyrmion Lattices
Authors: Michiki Taniwaki, Thomas Brian Winkler, Jan Rothörl, Raphael Gruber, Chiharu Mitsumata, Masato Kotsugi, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) quasi-particle systems, such as magnetic skyrmions, exhibit topological phase transitions between unique 2D phases. However, to identify the phases, an easy and computationally low-cost methodology for capturing the configurational properties of lattice ordering and constructing such an appropriate descriptor that can be easily calculated is, though, not obvious. Here, we propose an indicator for topological phase transitions using persistent homology (PH). PH offers novel insights beyond conventional indicators by capturing topological features derived from the configurational properties of the lattice. The proposed persistent-homology-based topological indicator, which selectively counts stable features in a persistence diagram, effectively traces the lattice's topological changes, as confirmed by comparisons with the conventionally used measure of the ordering (the magnitude of the orientational order parameter $\langle|\Psi_6|\rangle$), typically used to identify lattice phases. We demonstrate the applicability of our indicator to experimental data, showing that it yields results consistent with those of simulations. This experimental validation highlights the robustness of the proposed method for real physical systems beyond idealized simulated systems. While our method is demonstrated in the context of skyrmion lattice systems, the approach is general and can be extended to other two-dimensional systems composed of interacting quasi-particles. As a key advantage, our indicator offers lower computational complexity than the conventionally used measures.

Title: Swap Monte Carlo for diatomic molecules
Authors: Till Böhmer, Jeppe C. Dyre, Lorenzo Costigliola
Abstract: In recent years the Swap Monte Carlo algorithm has led to remarkable progress in equilibrating supercooled model liquids at low temperatures. Applications have so far been limited to systems composed of spherical particles, however, whereas most real-world supercooled liquids are molecular. We here introduce a simple size-polydisperse molecular model that allows for efficient thermal equilibration in silico with the Swap Monte Carlo method, resulting in an estimated speedup of 1,000-1,000,000 at moderate polydispersity (5-10%). The model exhibits little difference between size-resolved orientational time-autocorrelation functions.

Title: Thermal Hall conductivity in the strongest cuprate superconductor: Estimate of the mean free path in the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8 + δ}$
Authors: Munkhtuguldur Altangerel, Quentin Barthélemy, Étienne Lefrançois, Jordan Baglo, Manel Mezidi, Gaël Grissonnanche, Ashvini Vallipuram, Emma Campillo, Anne Forget, Dorothée Colson, Ruixing Liang, D. A. Bonn, W. N. Hardy, Cyril Proust, Louis Taillefer
Abstract: The thermal Hall conductivity of the trilayer cuprate HgBa$_2$Ca$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{8+\delta}$ (Hg1223) - the superconductor with the highest critical temperature $T_c$ at ambient pressure - was measured at temperatures down to 2 K for three dopings in the underdoped regime ($p$ = 0.09, 0.10, 0.11). By combining a previously introduced simple model and prior theoretical results, we derive a formula for the inverse mean free path, $1 / \ell$, which allows us to estimate the mean free path of $d$-wave quasiparticles in Hg1223 below $T_c$. We find that $1 / \ell$ grows as $T^3$, in agreement with the theoretical expectation for a clean $d$-wave superconductor. Measurements were also conducted on the single layer mercury-based cuprate HgBa$_2$CuO$_{6+\delta}$ (Hg1201), revealing that the mean free path in this compound is roughly half that of its three-layered counterpart at the same doping ($p$ = 0.10). This observation is be attributed to the protective role of the outer planes in Hg1223, which results in a more pristine inner plane. We also report data in an ultraclean crystal of YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_y$ (YBCO) with full oxygen content $p$ = 0.18, believed to be the cleanest of any cuprate, and find that $\ell$ is not longer than in Hg1223.

Title: Braided mixing in confined chiral active matter
Authors: Yue Wang, Jonas Berx
Abstract: Efficient mixing of fluids is essential in many practical applications to achieve homogeneity. For microscopic systems, however, both diffusion and turbulence are ineffective methods to achieve chaotic mixing due to the low Reynolds number, hence either active stirring or inducing turbulence through geometric boundary effects are generally implemented. Here, we study a modified chiral Vicsek model, where active microswimmers act as moving rods, stirring the surrounding substrate. We study the degree of mixing in the patterns formed by interplay between confinement, chiral motion and alignment interactions. This mixing is computed by considering the entanglement of spacetime trajectories of the particles, which forms a braid. Optimising the finite-time braiding exponent of this braid then yields a set of constituent parameters of the system, showing that a pattern consisting of a local stable vortex droplet and an ordered oscillating phase achieves the highest degree of mixing.

Title: Diffuson-Dominated Thermal Transport Crossover from Ordered to Liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$:The Negligible Role of Ion Hopping
Authors: Jincheng Yue, Jiongzhi Zheng, Xingchen Shen, Krishnendu Maji, Chun-Chuen Yang, Shuyao Lin, Pierric Lemoine, Emmanuel Guilmeau, Yanhui Liu, Tian Cui
Abstract: Fundamentally understanding lattice dynamics and thermal transport behavior in liquid-like, partially occupied compounds remains a long-standing challenge in condensed matter physics. Here, we investigate the microscopic mechanisms underlying the ultralow thermal conductivity in ordered/liquid-like Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ by combining experimental methods with first-principles calculations. We first experimentally synthesize and characterize the ordered structure and liquid-like, partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with increasing temperature. We then combine self-consistent phonon calculations, including bubble-diagram corrections, with the Wigner transport equation, considering both phonon propagation and diffuson contributions, to evaluate the anharmonic lattice dynamics and thermal conductivity in phase-change Cu$_3$BiS$_3$. Our theoretical model predicts an ultralow thermal conductivity of 0.34 W/m/K at 400 K, dominated by diffuson contributions, which accurately reproduces and explains the experimental data. Importantly, the machine-learning-based molecular dynamics (MD) simulations not only reproduced the partially Cu-atom occupied Cu$_3$BiS$_3$ structure with the space group $\mathrm{P2_12_12_1}$ but also successfully replicated the thermal conductivity obtained from experiments and Wigner transport calculations. This observation highlights the negligible impact of ionic mobility arising from partially occupied Cu sites on the thermal conductivity in diffuson-dominated thermal transport compounds. Our work not only sheds light on the minimal impact of ionic mobility on ultralow thermal conductivity in phase-change materials but also demonstrates that the Wigner transport equation accurately describes thermal transport behavior in partially occupied phases with diffuson-dominant thermal transport.

Title: Navigating Chiral Spin Architectures in Non-Collinear Antiferromagnetic Thin Films
Authors: Freya Johnson, Jan Zemen, Geri Topore, Michele Shelly Conroy, Shanglong Ning, Jiahao Han, Shunsuke Fukami, Chiara Ciccarelli, Lesley F. Cohen
Abstract: Noncollinear antiferromagnets offer much promise for antiferromagnetic spintronics and neuromorphic applications with a plethora of functional properties surpassing many competing magnetic systems. Films grown on mismatched substrates may relieve strain by the creation of slip-plane defects that strongly manipulate global physical properties important for application. This work demonstrates that a post growth annealing strategy results in near-defect-free, structurally robust films that reveal the underlying thermal evolution of the magnetic order symmetry. Beyond a critical film thickness, the spin structure transitions between two right-handed irreducible chiral representations via left-handed chiral ordering producing a striking change in the sign and angular dependence of the Anomalous Hall coefficient. The previously established mechanism of spin rotations in the (111) plane cannot fully explain the transition in applied magnetic field, and using a macrospin model this work finds that rotations along the chirality-inverting [1-10] direction are energetically preferable under certain conditions. These observations suggest that both left-handed and right-handed chiral order can be accessed in a single system, opening new routes to engineer devices by controlled switching of magnetic chirality allowing selection of associated functional properties as governed by symmetry.

Title: Electrical manipulation of magnetic domain structure in van der Waals ferromagnetic Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ using ferroelectric PMN-PT single crystal
Authors: Riku Iimori, Yuta Kodani, Shaojie Hu, Takashi Kimura
Abstract: 2D van der Waals (vdW) ferromagnets have emerged as promising materials for spintronic applications due to their unique magnetic properties and tunability. Controlling ferromagnetism via external stimuli is critical for both fundamental research and device integration. In particular, modulation of magnetic anisotropy and exchange interactions through strain offers a viable pathway for functional control. Owing to their weak interlayer coupling, vdW ferromagnets exhibit pronounced sensitivity to strain, enabling effective tuning of their magnetic states. In this study, electric-field-induced magnetoelectric coupling is investigated in the above-room-temperature vdW ferromagnet Fe$_3$GaTe$_2$ integrated on a ferroelectric PMN-PT substrate. It is demonstrated that application of an electric field leads to a substantial reduction in coercive force along with dynamic reconfiguration of the magnetic domain structure. These effects are attributed to electric-field-induced modulation of the vdW interlayer gap and enhancement of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. These findings reveal a strong interplay between electric fields and magnetism in vdW systems, offering a viable route toward the development of low-power, multifunctional magnetic devices. This work establishes a foundation for the electric-field control of magnetic properties in vdW ferromagnets and highlights their potential in next-generation spintronic technologies.

Title: Large strain contribution to the laser-driven magnetization response of magnetostrictive TbFe$_{2}$
Authors: C. Walz, F.-C. Weber, S.-P. Zeuschner, K. Dumesnil, A. von Reppert, M. Bargheer
Abstract: We investigate strain-induced contributions to the transient polar magneto-optical Kerr effect response in laser-excited terfenol. The tr-MOKE signals obtained from TbFe$_{2}$ films with and without glass capping exhibit distinct signatures associated with transient strain. We experimentally observe the arrival of strain pulses via the reflectivity change. The tr-MOKE response measured without changing the pump-probe geometry is delayed by several picoseconds. This suggests a genuine magnetization response as opposed to instantaneous changes of optical constants as the origin of the signal. We model the propagation of longitudinal acoustic picosecond strain pulses and incorporate the inverse magnetostriction effect via a magnetoelastic term in the effective field of the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation with large damping. This reproduces not only the delay of the pulsed response, but also unveils the dominant contribution of quasi-static strain to the magnetization dynamics due to the thermal expansion in the optically probed near-surface region. Our experiments exemplify that purely longitudinal strain along the out-of-plane direction of the thin film enables efficient magnetoelastic coupling via the shear strain components arising in the oblique crystallographic frame of reference.

Title: Transfer-matrix approach to the Blume-Capel model on the triangular lattice
Authors: Dimitrios Mataragkas, Alexandros Vasilopoulos, Nikolaos G. Fytas, Dong-Hee Kim
Abstract: We investigate the spin-$1$ Blume-Capel model on an infinite strip of the triangular lattice using the transfer-matrix method combined with a sparse-matrix factorization technique. Through finite-size scaling analysis of numerically exact spectra for strip widths up to $L = 19$, we accurately locate the tricritical point improving upon recent Monte Carlo estimates. In the first-order regime, we observe exponential scaling of the spectral gap, reflecting the linear growth of interfacial tension as the temperature decreases below the tricritical point. Finally, we validate our tricritical point estimate through precise agreement with conformal field theory predictions for the tricritical Ising universality class. Our results underscore the continued utility of the transfer-matrix approach for studying phase transitions in complex lattice models.

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schrödinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.

Title: Thermoelectric optimization and quantum-to-classical crossover in gate-controlled two-dimensional semiconducting nanojunctions
Authors: Yu-Chang Chen, Yu-Chen Chang
Abstract: We investigate the thermoelectric performance of 2D nanojunctions with gate tunable architectures and varying channel lengths from 3 to 12 nm using a combination of first principles simulations, including density functional theory, DFT with nonequilibrium Greens function formalism (nanoDCAL), and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations. Our study reveals a gate, temperature, and length dependent transition from quantum to classical in electron transport, transitioning from quantum tunneling in short junctions to thermionic emission in longer ones. We observe nontrivial dependencies of the thermoelectric figure of merit on the Seebeck coefficient, electrical conductivities, and thermal conductivities as a result of this crossover and gate controlling. We identify that maximizing ZT requires tuning the chemical potential just outside the band gap, where the system lies at the transition between insulating and conducting regimes. While extremely large Seebeck coefficients are observed in the insulating state, they do not yield high ZT due to suppressed electrical conductivity and dominant phononic thermal transport. The optimal ZT larger than 2.3 is achieved in the shortest 3 nm junction at 500 K, where quantum tunneling and thermionic emission coexist. These findings offer fundamental insights into transport mechanisms in 2D semiconducting nanojunctions and present design principles for high efficiency nanoscale thermoelectric devices.

Title: Sliding Engineering Spin-Valley-Layer Coupling and Altermagnetism in Bilayer Antiferromagnetic Honeycomb Lattices
Authors: Wen-Xin Jiang, Zhen-Hao Gong, Yuantao Chen, Zhigang Gui, Li Huang
Abstract: Valley polarization and altermagnetism are two emerging fundamental phenomena in condensed matter physics, offering unprecedented opportunites for information encoding and processing in novel energy-efficient devices. By coupling valley and spin degrees of freedom with ferroic orders such as ferroelectricity, nonvolatile memory functionalities can be achieved. Here, we propose a way to realize ferroelectric-valley (FE-valley) and FE-altermagnetic coupling in a bilayer antiferromagnetic (AFM) honeycomb lattices based on an effective four-band spin-full $k\cdot p$ model. Our proposal is validated in bilayer MnPTe$_3$ through first-principles calculations. A spontaneous out-of-plane electric polarization occurs in AB- (BA-) stacking configuration, which is reversibly switchable via interlayer sliding. Remarkably, polarization reversal simultaneously inverts both layer-resolved valley polarization and altermagnetic spin splitting. This dual control enables tunable layer-spin-locked anomalous valley Hall effects and an unprecedented magnetoelectric response in 2D antiferromagnets. Our work establishes a general paradigm for electrically programmable valleytronic and spintronic functionalities of 2D AFM materials.

Title: A Hierarchy of Topological and Superconducting States in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Ron Q. Nguyen, Hai-Tian Wu, Erin Morissette, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Peiyu Qin, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Aaron W. Hui, Dima E. Feldman, J. I. A. Li
Abstract: Superconductivity and the quantum Hall effect are conventionally viewed as mutually exclusive: the former is suppressed by magnetic fields, while the latter relies on them. Here, we report the surprising coexistence of these two phenomena in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene. In this system, a superconducting phase is not destroyed -- but instead stabilized -- by an out-of-plane magnetic field. Strikingly, this superconducting state coexists and competes with a sequence of quantum Hall states that appear at both integer and half-integer Landau level fillings. Both the superconducting and quantum Hall states exhibit sharply defined thermal transitions or crossovers, with nearly identical onset temperatures -- pointing to a shared underlying mechanism. Taken together, our observations uncover an unprecedented interplay between superconducting and topological phases, challenging conventional paradigms and opening a new frontier in condensed matter physics.

Title: aLLoyM: A large language model for alloy phase diagram prediction
Authors: Yuna Oikawa, Guillaume Deffrennes, Taichi Abe, Ryo Tamura, Koji Tsuda
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are general-purpose tools with wide-ranging applications, including in materials science. In this work, we introduce aLLoyM, a fine-tuned LLM specifically trained on alloy compositions, temperatures, and their corresponding phase information. To develop aLLoyM, we curated question-and-answer (Q&A) pairs for binary and ternary phase diagrams using the open-source Computational Phase Diagram Database (CPDDB) and assessments based on CALPHAD (CALculation of PHAse Diagrams). We fine-tuned Mistral, an open-source pre-trained LLM, for two distinct Q&A formats: multiple-choice and short-answer. Benchmark evaluations demonstrate that fine-tuning substantially enhances performance on multiple-choice phase diagram questions. Moreover, the short-answer model of aLLoyM exhibits the ability to generate novel phase diagrams from its components alone, underscoring its potential to accelerate the discovery of previously unexplored materials systems. To promote further research and adoption, we have publicly released the short-answer fine-tuned version of aLLoyM, along with the complete benchmarking Q&A dataset, on Hugging Face.

Title: Comparative molecular dynamics simulations of charged solid-liquid interfaces with different water models
Authors: Mahdi Tavakol, Kislon Voïtchovsky
Abstract: Aqueous solid-liquid interfaces (SLI) are ubiquitous in nature and technology, often hosting molecular-level processes with macroscopic consequences. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations offer a tool of choice to investigate interfacial phenomena with atomistic precision, but there exists a large number of water models, each optimised for a different purpose. Here we compare the ability of common water models to accurately simulate the interface between a charged silica surface and an aqueous solution containing NaCl. We first compare the bulk dielectric constant of water and its dependence on salt concentration for SPC/Fw, SPC/e, TIPS3p, H2O/DC, TIP3P-Fw, OPC3, TIP3P, TIP3P-FB, TIP3P-ST, FBA/e, and TIPS3p-PPPM, revealing large variations between models. Simulating the interface with silica for the most suitable water models (SPC/Fw, H2O/DC, TIP3-ST and TIPS3p-PPPM) show some intrinsic consistency with continuum predictions (Poisson-Boltzmann) whereby the free energy minima obtained from MD and the analytical model are in agreement, provided the latter includes the MD-determined total charge of ions in the Stern layer and dielectric constant. This consistency stands even for water models with a dielectric constant off by 100%. For salt concentrations higher than 0.21 M NaCl, the formation of random ion-ion pairs limits the reproducibility of the MD results and the applicability of the analytical method. The results highlight the applicability of the analytical model down to the nanoscale, provided a priory knowledge of the Stern layer charge is available. The findings could have significant implications for MD simulations of SLIs, especially at charged or electrified interfaces.

Title: Quantum Spin Hall Effect with Extended Topologically Protected Features in Altermangetic Multilayers
Authors: Zhiyu Chen, Fangyang Zhan, Zheng Qin, Da-Shuai Ma, Dong-Hui Xu, Rui Wang
Abstract: Conventional topological classification theory dictates that time-reversal symmetry confines the quantum spin Hall (QSH) effect to a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ classification, permitting only a single pair of gapless helical edge states. Here, we utilize the recently discovered altermagnetism to circumvent this fundamental constraint. We demonstrate the realization of a unique QSH phase possessing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states in altermagnetic multilayers. This exotic QSH phase, characterized by a mirror-spin Chern number, emerges from the interplay of spin-orbit coupling and $d$-wave altermagnetic ordering. Moreover, using first-principles calculations, we identify altermagnetic Fe$_2$Se$_2$O multilayers as promising material candidates, in which the number of gapless helical edge states scales linearly with the number of layers, leading to a correspondingly large, exactly quantized, and experimentally accessible spin-Hall conductance. Our findings unveil a new mechanism for stabilizing multiple pairs of gapless helical edge states, significantly expanding the scope of QSH effects, and provide a blueprint for utilizing altermagnetism to engineer desired topological phases.

Title: Odd elasticity in disordered chiral active materials
Authors: Cheng-Tai Lee, Tom C. Lubensky, Tomer Markovich
Abstract: Chiral active materials are abundant in nature, including the cytoskeleton with attached motor proteins, rotary clusters of bacteria flagella, and self-spinning starfish embryos. These materials break both time reversal and mirror-image (parity) symmetries due to injection of torques at the microscale. Recently, it was found that chiral active materials may show a new type of elastic response termed `odd' elasticity. Currently, odd elasticity is understood microscopically only in ordered structures, e.g., lattice designs of metamaterials. It still remains to explore how odd elasticity can emerge in natural or biological systems, which are usually disordered. To address this, we propose a minimal generic model for disordered `odd solids', using micropolar (Cosserat) elasticity in the presence of local active torques. We find that odd elasticity naturally emerges as a nonlinear effect of internal particle rotations. Exploring the viscoelasticity of this solid, when immersed in active self-spinning solvent (`odd fluid'), we discover both dynamically unstable regions and regions in which bulk waves can propagate even in an overdamped solid.

Title: Localization structure of electronic states in the quantum Hall effect
Authors: Alioune Seye, Marcel Filoche
Abstract: We investigate the localization of electronic states in the Integer Quantum Hall Effect (IQHE) using a magnetic localization landscape (MLL) approach. By studying a continuum Schrödinger model with disordered electrostatic potential, we demonstrate that the MLL, defined via a modified landscape function incorporating magnetic effects, captures key features of quantum state localization. The MLL effective potential reveals the spatial confinement regions and provides predictions of eigenstate energies, particularly in regimes where traditional semiclassical approximations break down. Numerical simulations show that below a critical energy, states localize around minima of the effective potential, while above it, they cluster around maxima-with edge effects becoming significant near boundaries. Bridging the gap between semiclassical intuition and full quantum models, the MLL offers a robust framework to understand transport and localization in disordered quantum Hall systems, and extends the applicability of landscape theory to magnetic systems.

Title: Inverse Lieb Materials: Altermagnetism and More
Authors: Po-Hao Chang, Igor I. Mazin, Kirill D. Belashchenko
Abstract: The Lieb lattice, originally proposed for cuprate superconductors, has gained new attention in the emerging field of altermagnetism as a minimal analytical model for the latter. While initially the so-called inverse Lieb lattice (ILL) was deemed only a theoretical model, recently several real materials with this crystallographic motif have been found. The unique geometry of ILL can accommodate complex magnetic orderings arising from competing exchange interactions and geometric frustration, offering great tunability for magnetic properties. In this work, we provide comprehensive insights into magnetic phases in ILL materials and establish guidelines for efficient identification of altermagnetic materials within this family. We begin by constructing phase diagrams using a simple Heisenberg model to elucidate the fundamental mechanisms underlying altermagnetism and other complex magnetic phases observed experimentally. To bridge theory with experiment, we systematically investigate a series of existing ILL compounds using density functional theory (DFT) calculations to determine their magnetic ground states. Our computational results are in good agreement with experimental observations. Importantly, we identify a trend linking magnetic ordering to the $d$-shell filling of transition metal ions, with $d^{2-3}$ and $d^{5}$ configurations showing propensity for altermagnetic behavior. Additionally, we identify a promising metallic compound Sr$_{2}$CrO$_{2}$Cr$_{2}$OAs$_{2}$ as an altermagnet that is highly anisotropic in its $J_2$ exchange couplings with large Néel temperature ($\sim 600$ K). Using exchange coupling parameters extracted from DFT calculations, we compute the magnon spectra for altermagnetic systems. As expected, chiral splittings in the magnon dispersion are directly correlated with anisotropy between crystallographically inequivalent $J_{2}$ exchange interactions.

Title: Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$
Authors: Yihao Hu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.

Title: Theory of magnon hydrodynamics in collinear antiferromagnets
Authors: Vivianne Olguín-Arias, Alireza Qaiumzadeh, Roberto E. Troncoso
Abstract: We investigate the transport of spin angular momentum and linear momentum carried by magnons in electrically insulating collinear antiferromagnets (AFs). Focusing on both transverse and longitudinal geometries, we model magnons as a viscous fluid and explore the hydrodynamic transport regime that emerges when the magnon-magnon scattering length is shorter than the momentum-relaxation length, such that momentum-conserving processes dominate over momentum-relaxing ones. We develop a theoretical framework to investigate viscous effects in the magnon hydrodynamic regime, which give rise to measurable transport signatures such as nonlocal resistance and spin and thermal conductance. Accounting for both momentum and spin relaxations, we derive hydrodynamic equations governing magnon momentum and spin transport. Notably, interspecies scattering between antiferromagnetic magnons with opposite spin angular momentum induces drag-like effects that strongly modify spin current propagation. We derive expressions for magnon conductivity and introduce an accessibility parameter quantifying intra-band momentum transfer. Our results establish antiferromagnetic insulators as a promising platform for observing magnon-fluid dynamics and exploring collective spin transport phenomena.

Title: Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers
Authors: Shinian Cheng, Lilliana Rey, Beibei Yao, Ivan Popov, Alexei P. Sokolov
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.

Title: Analytical shortcuts to adiabaticity of weakly driven processes
Authors: Pierre Nazé
Abstract: The analytical expression for shortcuts to adiabaticity for any switching time and any thermally isolated system performing a finite-time and weakly driven process is presented. It is based on the analytical solution of the optimal protocols of weak processes for open systems. The extension to adiabatic processes was made by employing the concept of waiting time. The shortcuts to adiabaticity are proven by showing that the excess power is null in all instants, indicating that no nonequilibrium excitation occurs along the driving. Two examples are solved to verify the validity of such shortcuts: the typical case of oscillatory relaxation function and the transverse-field quantum Ising chain. In this last case, it is shown that non-quenching process outperforms the quenching one by suppressing the non-equilibrium excitations until the critical point is not achieved.

Title: Anomalous size effects with fixed criticality in bistable flexible mechanical metamaterials
Authors: Zehuan Tang, Tingfeng Ma, Boyue Su, Qing Xia, Pengfei Kang, Bowei Wu
Abstract: When the structure deformation is dominated by the low-energy deformation mode, the structure hardens with the increase in the size (number of units) at small sizes. This anomalous behavior will eventually disappear with the decay length of the finite structure converging to a size-independent characteristic quantity, but the specific critical point at which the anomalous behavior disappears still cannot be accurately and concisely described. Here, under two steady states of the bistable chain, we observed anomalous size effects with constant and oscillating criticality (the proportion of inhomogeneous deformation), two criticalities exactly separate the increasing and decreasing intervals of stiffness variation. They are interrelated due to the implied symmetries between the two steady states. On the other hand, they are distinguished because of the opposite superposition modes under the two steady states. Specifically, the constant criticality corresponds to the anomalous size effect achieved by the competition mechanism, while the oscillating criticality reveals an anomalous size effect achieved by the new mechanism (cancellation mechanism). In the anomalous size effect achieved by the cancellation mechanism, the singular characteristics generated by the completely cancelled deformation make it very robust. This robustness reflects in that the anomalous effect is no longer limited to linear small deformation, but it can still be observed stably in nonlinear large deformation. Our study reinterprets the anomalous size effect at a quantitative level, and the proposed cancellation mechanism expands the possible application range of this anomalous effect.

Title: Subspace-projected multireference covariant density functional theory
Authors: X. Zhang, C. C. Wang, C. R. Ding, J. M. Yao
Abstract: Multireference density functional theory (MR-DFT) has been a pivotal method for studying nuclear low-lying states and neutrinoless double-beta ($0\nu\beta\beta$) decay. However, quantifying their theoretical uncertainties has been a significant challenge due to the computational demands. This study introduces a subspace-projected covariant density functional theory (SP-CDFT), which efficiently emulates MR-CDFT calculations for nuclear low-lying states. This approach leverages the eigenvector continuation method combined with the quantum-number projected generator coordinate method, based on a relativistic energy density functional (EDF). We apply SP-CDFT to investigate the correlations among the physical quantities of nuclear matter, nuclear low-lying spectroscopy, and the nuclear matrix elements (NMEs) of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay in the two heaviest candidate nuclei. Our findings reveal generally strong correlations between the NMEs of $0\nu\beta\beta$ decay and the excitation energy of the $2_1^+$ state, as well as the $E2$ transition strength, although these correlations vary significantly among nuclei. This work also paves the way for refining nuclear EDF parameters using spectroscopic data.

Title: Quantum-data-driven dynamical transition in quantum learning
Authors: Bingzhi Zhang, Junyu Liu, Liang Jiang, Quntao Zhuang
Abstract: Quantum neural networks, parameterized quantum circuits optimized under a specific cost function, provide a paradigm for achieving near-term quantum advantage in quantum information processing. Understanding QNN training dynamics is crucial for optimizing their performance, however, the role of quantum data in training for supervised learning such as classification and regression remains unclear. We reveal a quantum-data-driven dynamical transition where the target values and data determine the convergence of the training. Through analytical classification over the fixed points of the dynamical equation, we reveal a comprehensive `phase diagram' featuring seven distinct dynamics originating from a bifurcation with multiple codimension. Perturbative analyses identify both exponential and polynomial convergence class. We provide a non-perturbative theory to explain the transition via generalized restricted Haar ensemble. The analytical results are confirmed with numerical simulations and experimentation on IBM quantum devices. Our findings provide guidance on constructing the cost function to accelerate convergence in QNN training.

Title: Experimental protocol for observing single quantum many-body scars with transmon qubits
Authors: Peter Græns Larsen, Anne E. B. Nielsen, André Eckardt, Francesco Petiziol
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars are energy eigenstates which fail to reproduce thermal expectation values of local observables, in systems where the rest of the many-body spectrum fulfils eigenstate thermalization. Experimental observation of quantum many-body scars has so far been limited to models with multiple scar states evenly spaced in energy. It is thus an interesting question whether even single isolated scars, which theoretically embody the weakest possibile violation of eigenstate thermalization and may be thought to have no detectable impact in experiments, can leave a trace in measurable quantities. Moreover, single scars offer an interesting scenario for exploring the connection between quantum many-body scars and the original notion of scarring in quantum dynamical systems theory. Here we propose protocols to observe single scars in architectures of fixed-frequency, fixed-coupling superconducting qubits. We first adapt known models possessing the desired features into a form particularly suited for the experimental platform. We develop protocols for the implementation of these models, through trotterized sequences of two-qubit cross-resonance interactions, and verify the existence of the approximate scar state in the stroboscopic effective Hamiltonian. Since a single scar cannot be detected from coherent revivals in the dynamics, differently from towers of scar states, we propose and numerically investigate alternative and experimentally-accessible signatures. These include the dynamical response of the scar to local state deformations, to controlled noise, and to the resolution of the Lie-Suzuki-Trotter digitization.

Title: Resource-optimized fault-tolerant simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model and high-temperature superconductor models
Authors: Angus Kan, Benjamin Symons
Abstract: Exploring low-cost applications is paramount to creating value in early fault-tolerant quantum computers. Here we optimize both gate and qubit counts of recent algorithms for simulating the Fermi-Hubbard model. We further devise and compile algorithms to simulate established models of cuprate and pnictide high-temperature superconductors, which include beyond-nearest-neighbor hopping terms and multi-orbital interactions that are absent in the Fermi-Hubbard model. We show that simulations of these more realistic models of high-temperature superconductors require only an order of magnitude or so more Toffoli gates than a simulation of the Fermi-Hubbard model. Furthermore, we find plenty classically difficult instances with Toffoli and qubit counts that far lower than commonly considered quantum phase estimation circuits for electronic structure problems in quantum chemistry. We believe our results pave the way towards studying high-temperature superconductors on early fault-tolerant quantum computers.

Abstract: The efficacy of mathematical models heavily depends on the quality of the training data, yet collecting sufficient data is often expensive and challenging. Many modeling applications require inferring parameters only as a means to predict other quantities of interest (QoI). Because models often contain many unidentifiable (sloppy) parameters, QoIs often depend on a relatively small number of parameter combinations. Therefore, we introduce an information-matching criterion based on the Fisher Information Matrix to select the most informative training data from a candidate pool. This method ensures that the selected data contain sufficient information to learn only those parameters that are needed to constrain downstream QoIs. It is formulated as a convex optimization problem, making it scalable to large models and datasets. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach across various modeling problems in diverse scientific fields, including power systems and underwater acoustics. Finally, we use information-matching as a query function within an Active Learning loop for material science applications. In all these applications, we find that a relatively small set of optimal training data can provide the necessary information for achieving precise predictions. These results are encouraging for diverse future applications, particularly active learning in large machine learning models.

Title: Trapping of Single Atoms in Metasurface Optical Tweezer Arrays
Authors: Aaron Holman, Yuan Xu, Ximo Sun, Jiahao Wu, Mingxuan Wang, Zezheng Zhu, Bojeong Seo, Nanfang Yu, Sebastian Will
Abstract: Optical tweezer arrays have emerged as a key experimental platform for quantum computation, quantum simulation, and quantum metrology, enabling unprecedented levels of control over single atoms and molecules. However, existing tweezer platforms have fundamental limitations in array geometry, size, and scalability. Here we demonstrate the trapping of single strontium atoms in optical tweezer arrays generated via holographic metasurfaces. We realize two dimensional arrays with more than 1000 trapped atoms, arranged in arbitrary geometries with trap spacings as small as 1.5 um. The arrays have a high uniformity in terms of trap depth, trap frequency, and positional accuracy, rivaling or surpassing existing approaches. This is enabled by highly efficient holographic metasurfaces fabricated from high-refractive index materials, silicon-rich silicon nitride and titanium dioxide. Leveraging sub-micrometer pixel sizes and high pixel densities, our platform allows scaling far beyond current capabilities. As a demonstration, we realize an optical tweezer array with 360,000 traps. These advances will facilitate tweezer-array based quantum applications that require large system sizes.

Title: Microwave-to-Optical Quantum Transduction with Antiferromagnets
Authors: Akihiko Sekine, Ryo Murakami, Yoshiyasu Doi
Abstract: The quantum transduction, or equivalently quantum frequency conversion, between microwave and optical photons is essential for realizing scalable quantum computers with superconducting qubits. Due to the large frequency difference between microwave and optical ranges, the transduction needs to be done via intermediate bosonic modes or nonlinear processes. Regarding the transduction mediated by magnons, previous studies have so far utilized ferromagnetic magnons in ferromagnets. Here, we formulate a theory for the microwave-to-optical quantum transduction mediated by antiferromagnetic magnons in antiferromagnets. We derive analytical expressions for the transduction efficiency in the cases with and without an optical cavity, where a microwave cavity is used in both cases. In contrast to the case of the quantum transduction using ferromagnets, we find that the quantum transduction can occur even in the absence of an external static magnetic field. We also find that, in the case with an optical cavity the transduction efficiency takes a peak structure with respect to the sample thickness, indicating that there exists an optimal thickness, whereas in the case without an optical cavity the transduction efficiency is a monotonically increasing function of the sample thickness. Our study opens up a way for possible applications of antiferromagnetic materials in future quantum interconnects.

Title: Quantum Cluster State Model with Haagerup Fusion Category Symmetry
Authors: Zhian Jia
Abstract: We propose a (1+1)D lattice model, inspired by a weak Hopf algebra generalization of the cluster state model, which realizes Haagerup fusion category symmetry and features a tensor product Hilbert space. The construction begins with a reconstruction of the Haagerup weak Hopf algebra $H_3$ from the Haagerup fusion category, ensuring that the representation category of $H_3$ is equivalent to Haagerup fusion category. Utilizing the framework of symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), we develop an ultra-thin weak Hopf quantum double model, characterized by a smooth topological boundary condition. We show that this model supports Haagerup fusion category symmetry. Finally, we solve the ground state of the model in terms of a weak Hopf matrix product state, which serves as a natural generalization of the cluster state, embodying Haagerup fusion category symmetry.

Title: Accurate and thermodynamically consistent hydrogen equation of state for planetary modeling with flow matching
Authors: Hao Xie, Saburo Howard, Guglielmo Mazzola
Abstract: Accurate determination of the equation of state of dense hydrogen is essential for understanding gas giants. Currently, there is still no consensus on methods for calculating its entropy, which play a fundamental role and can result in qualitatively different predictions for Jupiter's interior. Here, we investigate various aspects of entropy calculation for dense hydrogen based on ab initio molecular dynamics simulations. Specifically, we employ the recently developed flow matching method to validate the accuracy of the traditional thermodynamic integration approach. We then clearly identify pitfalls in previous attempts and propose a reliable framework for constructing the hydrogen equation of state, which is accurate and thermodynamically consistent across a wide range of temperature and pressure conditions. This allows us to conclusively address the long-standing discrepancies in Jupiter's adiabat among earlier studies, demonstrating the potential of our approach for providing reliable equations of state of diverse materials.

Title: Two-Photon Interference from an InAs Quantum Dot emitting in the Telecom C-Band
Authors: Jaewon Kim, Jochen Kaupp, Yorick Reum, Giora Peniakov, Johannes Michl, Felix Kohr, Monika Emmerling, Martin Kamp, Yong-Hoon Cho, Tobias Huber-Loyola, Sven Höfling, Andreas T. Pfenning
Abstract: Two-photon interference from an InAs/InAlGaAs quantum dot (QD) emitting in the telecom C-band with a raw two-photon interference visibility of $V_{HOM}=(71.9\pm0.2)$ % is demonstrated. This is achieved by a two-fold approach: an improvement of the molecular beam epitaxial growth for better QDs, and integration of the QDs into an optical circular Bragg grating resonator for a Purcell enhancement of the radiative decay rate. The quantum optical properties of the fabricated device are studied by means of time-correlated single-photon counting under quasi-resonant excitation of the charged exciton line. A reduced lifetime of $T_1=(257.5\pm0.2)$ ps is found corresponding to a Purcell factor of $F_P\geqq(4.7\pm0.5)$. Pronounced anti-bunching of the second-order autocorrelation function at zero time delay $g^{(2)} (0)=(0.0307\pm0.0004)$ confirms the single-photon emission character. The two-photon interference is demonstrated with an unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer in Hong-Ou-Mandel configuration. We discuss strategies how to further improve the indistinguishability, and provide a survey of the state-of-the art.

Title: Holographic Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations in Finite Density Systems
Authors: Shivam K. Sharma
Abstract: Using real-time holography, we investigate fluctuation-dissipation relations in holographic systems at finite density. In the bulk, it corresponds to the study of scattering of a charged scalar field against a charged black hole background, leading to an exterior field theory outside the AdS Reissner-Nordström black hole. This theory captures dissipation (from infalling Quasi-normal modes) and fluctuations (from Hawking radiation). Here, we also develop a Witten diagrammatic framework for computing $n$-point functions for interacting charged scalars. From the boundary perspective, it gives real-time correlations of the dual CFT held at finite temperature and finite chemical potential. Our results yield (non)-linear holographic fluctuation-dissipation relations at small but finite density, which are shown to recover the correct behaviour in the zero-density limit.

Title: Detecting emergent 1-form symmetries with quantum error correction
Authors: Yu-Jie Liu, Wen-Tao Xu, Frank Pollmann, Michael Knap
Abstract: Higher-form symmetries act on sub-dimensional spatial manifolds of a quantum system and they can emerge as an exact symmetry at low energies even when they are explicitly broken at the microscopic level, making them difficult to characterize. In this work, we propose a quantitative criterion for the existence of 1-form symmetries motivated by quantum error correction (QEC). We show that the loss of the emergent 1-form symmetry is an information-theoretic transition revealed from the ensemble of post-measurement states. We analytically determine the regimes in which a 1-form symmetry emerges in product states on one- and two-dimensional lattices. The latter can be solved by mapping the ensemble of post-measurement states to the partition sum of a random bond Ising model along the Nishimori line. In analytically intractable regimes, we demonstrate how to detect 1-form symmetries with a global Minimal-Weight Perfect Matching (MWPM) decoder and numerically examine the information-theoretic transition of the 1-form symmetry, including systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological order. As an application of our protocol, we show that once the 1-form symmetry is detected to exist, a topological quantum phase transition characterized by the spontaneous breaking of the 1-form symmetry can be accurately detected by a disorder parameter. By exploiting ideas from quantum error correction, our work develops an information-theoretic criterion for emergent 1-form symmetries, which furthers our understanding of exotic symmetries and offers practical routes toward their characterization.

Title: Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling
Authors: Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.

Title: Zipping many-body quantum states: a scalable approach to diagonal entropy
Authors: Yu-Hsueh Chen, Tarun Grover
Abstract: The outcomes of projective measurements on a quantum many-body system in a chosen basis are inherently probabilistic. The Shannon entropy of this probability distribution (the "diagonal entropy") often reveals universal features, such as the existence of a quantum phase transition. A brute-force tomographic approach to estimating this entropy scales exponentially with the system size. Here, we explore using the Lempel-Ziv lossless image compression algorithm as an efficient, scalable alternative, readily implementable in a quantum gas microscope or programmable quantum devices. We test this approach on several examples: one-dimensional quantum Ising model, and two-dimensional states that display conventional symmetry breaking due to quantum fluctuations, or strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking due to local decoherence. We also employ the diagonal mixed state to put constraints on the phase boundaries of our models. In all examples, the compression method accurately recovers the entropy density while requiring at most polynomially many images. We also analyze the singular part of the diagonal entropy density using renormalization group on a replicated action. In the 1+1-D quantum Ising model, we find that it scales as $|t| \log|t|$, where $t$ is the deviation from the critical point, while in a 2+1-D state with amplitudes proportional to the Boltzmann weight of the 2D Ising model, it follows a $t^2 \log|t|$ scaling.

Title: Mesostructural origins of the anisotropic compressive properties of low-density closed-cell foams: A deeper understanding
Authors: L. Liu, F. Liu, D. Zenkert, M. Åkermo, M. Fagerström
Abstract: Many closed-cell foams exhibit an elongated cell shape in the foam rise direction, resulting in anisotropic compressive properties. Nevertheless, the underlying deformation mechanisms and how cell shape anisotropy induces this mechanical anisotropy are not yet fully understood, in particular for the foams with a high cell face fraction and low relative density. Moreover, the impacts of mesostructural stochastics are often overlooked. This contribution conducts a systematic numerical study on the anisotropic compressive behaviour of low-density closed-cell foams, which accounts for cell shape anisotropy, cell structure and different mesostructural stochastics. Representative volume elements (RVE) of foam mesostructures are modeled, with cell walls described as Reissner-Mindlin shells in a finite rotation setting. A mixed stress-strain driven homogenization scheme is introduced, which allows for enforcing an overall uniaxial stress state. Quantitative analysis of the cell wall deformation behaviour confirms the dominant role of membrane deformation in the initial elastic region, while the bending contribution gets important only after buckling, followed by membrane yielding. Based on the identified deformation mechanisms, analytical models are developed that relates mechanical anisotropy to cell shape anisotropy. It is found that cell shape anisotropy translates into the anisotropy of compressive properties through three pathways, cell load-bearing area fraction, cell wall buckling strength and cell wall inclination angle. Besides, the resulting mechanical anisotropy is strongly affected by the cell shape anisotropy stochastics while almost insensitive to the cell size and cell wall thickness stochastics. The present findings provide deeper insights into the relationships between the anisotropic compressive properties and mesostructures of low-density closed-cell foams.

Title: A Set of Tutorials for the LAMMPS Simulation Package
Authors: Simon Gravelle, Cecilia M. S. Alvares, Jacob R. Gissinger, Axel Kohlmeyer
Abstract: The availability of open-source molecular simulation software packages allows scientists and engineers to focus on running and analyzing simulations without having to write, parallelize, and validate their own simulation software. While molecular simulations thus become accessible to a larger audience, the `black box' nature of such software packages and wide array of options and features can make it challenging to use them correctly, particularly for beginners in the topic of MD simulations. LAMMPS is one such versatile molecular simulation code, designed for modeling particle-based systems across a broad range of materials science and computational chemistry applications, including atomistic, coarse-grained, mesoscale, grid-free continuum, and discrete element models. LAMMPS is capable of efficiently running simulations of varying sizes from small desktop computers to large-scale supercomputing environments. Its flexibility and extensibility make it ideal for complex and extensive simulations of atomic and molecular systems, and beyond. This article introduces a suite of tutorials designed to make learning LAMMPS more accessible to new users. The first four tutorials cover the basics of running molecular simulations in LAMMPS with systems of varying complexities. The second four tutorials address more advanced molecular simulation techniques, specifically the use of a reactive force field, grand canonical Monte Carlo, enhanced sampling, and the REACTER protocol. In addition, we introduce LAMMPS-GUI, an enhanced cross-platform graphical text editor specifically designed for use with LAMMPS and able to run LAMMPS directly on the edited input. LAMMPS-GUI is used as the primary tool in the tutorials to edit inputs, run LAMMPS, extract data, and visualize the simulated systems.

Title: Costs and benefits of phytoplankton motility
Authors: Peyman Fahimi, Andrew J. Irwin, Michael Lynch
Abstract: The motility skills of phytoplankton have evolved and persisted over millions of years, primarily in response to factors such as nutrient and light availability, temperature and viscosity gradients, turbulence, and predation pressure. Phytoplankton motility is broadly categorized into swimming and buoyancy regulation. Despite studies in the literature exploring the motility costs and benefits of phytoplankton, there remains a gap in our integrative understanding of direct and indirect energy expenditures, starting from when an organism initiates movement due to any biophysical motive, to when the organism encounters intracellular and environmental challenges. Here we gather available pieces of this puzzle from literature in biology, physics, and oceanography to paint an overarching picture of our current knowledge. The characterization of sinking and rising behavior as passive motility has resulted in the concept of sinking and rising internal efficiency being overlooked. We define this efficiency based on any energy dissipation associated with processes of mass density adjustment, as exemplified in structures like frustules and vacuoles. We propose that sinking and rising are active motility processes involving non-visible mechanisms, as species demonstrate active and rapid strategies in response to turbulence, predation risk, and gradients of nutrients, light, temperature, and viscosity. Identifying intracellular buoyancy-regulating dissipative processes offers deeper insight into the motility costs relative to the organism's total metabolic rate.

Title: Mitigation of correlated readout errors without randomized measurements
Authors: Adrian Skasberg Aasen, Andras Di Giovanni, Hannes Rotzinger, Alexey V. Ustinov, Martin Gärttner
Abstract: Quantum simulation, the study of strongly correlated quantum matter using synthetic quantum systems, has been the most successful application of quantum computers to date. It often requires determining observables with high precision, for example when studying critical phenomena near quantum phase transitions. Thus, readout errors must be carefully characterized and mitigated in data postprocessing, using scalable and noise-model agnostic protocols. We present a readout error-mitigation protocol that uses only single-qubit Pauli measurements and avoids experimentally challenging randomized measurements. The proposed approach captures a very broad class of correlated noise models and is scalable to large qubit systems. It is based on a complete and efficient characterization of few-qubit correlated positive operator-valued measures, using overlapping detector tomography. To assess the effectiveness of the protocol, observables are extracted from simulations involving up to 100 qubits employing readout errors obtained from experiments with superconducting qubits.

Title: Optimal bound on long-range distillable entanglement
Authors: Jonah Kudler-Flam, Vladimir Narovlansky, Nikita Sopenko
Abstract: We prove an upper bound on long-range distillable entanglement in $D$ spatial dimensions. Namely, it must decay faster than $1/r$, where $r$ is the distance between entangled regions. For states that are asymptotically rotationally invariant, the bound is strengthened to $1/r^D$. We then find explicit examples of quantum states with decay arbitrarily close to the bound. In one dimension, we construct free fermion Hamiltonians with nearest neighbor couplings that have these states as ground states. Curiously, states in conformal field theory are far from saturation, with distillable entanglement decaying faster than any polynomial.

Title: Violation of Universal Operator Growth Hypothesis in $W_3$ Conformal Field Theories
Authors: Dileep P. Jatkar, Sujoy Mahato, Sukrut Mondkar, Praveen Thalore
Abstract: We show that a large central charge conformal field theory with $W_3$ symmetry exhibits violation of the conjectured operator growth bound if the Liouvillian is modified to incorporate $W_3$ generators. We get 23 classes of Lanczos coefficients, obtained by the action of the Liouvillian on a descendant state. Among these, 10 classes of Lanczos coefficients violate the conjectured upper bound by exhibiting a faster-than-linear growth with the descendant level $N$. Two classes of them have asymptotic growth saturating at $N^2$, displaying maximal violation.

Title: Enhanced zeta potentials caused by surface ion mobilities
Authors: Evgeny S. Asmolov, Elena F. Silkina, Olga I. Vinogradova
Abstract: The electro-hydrodynamics near conducting walls is revisited. Attention is focused on the impact of an explicit diffuse Stern layer, which permittivity and viscosity differ from the bulk values, on the velocity of an electro-osmotic plug flow. To solve this problem we propose an approach of mapping the flow in the Stern layer to the surface dividing the Stern and diffuse layer, where an effective electro-hydrodynamic slip boundary condition is imposed. The latter implies that an effective surface charge is responding to the applied field and characterized by a mobility parameter $\mu \geq 1$. We derive analytic equations for $\mu$ and demonstrate that it is determined only by electrostatic properties of the electric double layer. These equations are then used to calculate electrokinetic (zeta) potentials of surfaces. We show that the zeta potential generally exceeds the surface one, which implies an amplification of the electro-osmotic flow. This effect is most pronounced if the hydrodynamic slip length is large and/or in concentrated solutions.

Title: Spin textures in curved paths on a curved surface
Authors: Guo-Hua Liang, Ai-Guo Mei, Zhi-Hui Yang, Ze-Lin Wei
Abstract: This study investigates the quantum dynamics of a spin-1/2 particle confined to a curved path from the dynamics of a two-dimensional curved thin-layer system incorporating spin connection contributions. We demonstrate that the geodesic curvature, normal curvature, and geodesic torsion govern the emergent non-Abelian gauge potential, while the geodesic and Gaussian curvatures govern the effective scalar potential in the Hamiltonian. The resulting spin precession dynamics induced by the gauge potential are analyzed with and without the adiabatic approximation. Under this approximation, the surface topology is linked to the rotation angle of spin orientation along a surface boundary and to the pseudo-magnetic flux. Spin texture evolution along helices illustrates distinct behaviors under geodesic versus non-geodesic propagation. Furthermore, the spin evolution along Viviani's curve exemplifies surface dependence. The curve's topology ensures closure of the spin direction and independence of the spin from the path direction. Our theory establishes a framework for spin-state manipulation via engineered nanostructured channels, enabling novel topological quantum control strategies.

Title: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids: I. Framework
Authors: Emad Chaparian
Abstract: A comprehensive Darcy-type law for viscoplastic fluids is proposed. Different regimes of yield-stress fluid flow in porous media can be categorised based on the Bingham number (i.e. the ratio of the yield stress to the characteristic viscous stress). In a recent study (Chaparian, J. Fluid Mech., vol. 980, A14, 2024), we addressed the yield/plastic limit (infinitely large Bingham number), namely, the onset of flow when the applied pressure gradient is just sufficient to overcome the yield stress resistance and initiate the flow. A purely geometrical universal scale was derived for the non-dimensional critical pressure gradient, which was thoroughly validated against computational data. In the present work, we investigate the Newtonian limit (infinitely large pressure difference compared to the yield stress of the fluid - ultra low Bingham number) both theoretically and computationally. We then propose a Darcy-type law applicable across the entire range of Bingham numbers by combining the mathematical models of the yield/plastic and Newtonian limits. Exhaustive computational data generated in this study (using augmented Lagrangian method coupled with anisotropic adaptive mesh at the pore scale) confirm the validity of the theoretical proposed law.

Title: Coupled Entropy: A Goldilocks Generalization for Complex Systems
Authors: Kenric P. Nelson
Abstract: The coupled entropy is proven to correct a flaw in the derivation of the Tsallis entropy and thereby solidify the theoretical foundations for analyzing the uncertainty of complex systems. The Tsallis entropy originated from considering power probabilities $p_i^q$ in which \textit{q} independent, identically-distributed random variables share the same state. The maximum entropy distribution was derived to be a \textit{q}-exponential, which is a member of the shape ($\kappa$), scale ($\sigma$) distributions. Unfortunately, the $q$-exponential parameters were treated as though valid substitutes for the shape and scale. This flaw causes a misinterpretation of the generalized temperature and an imprecise derivation of the generalized entropy. The coupled entropy is derived from the generalized Pareto distribution (GPD) and the Student's t distribution, whose shape derives from nonlinear sources and scale derives from linear sources of uncertainty. The Tsallis entropy of the GPD converges to one as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$, which makes it too cold. The normalized Tsallis entropy (NTE) introduces a nonlinear term multiplying the scale and the coupling, making it too hot. The coupled entropy provides perfect balance, ranging from $\ln \sigma$ for $\kappa=0$ to $\sigma$ as $\kappa\rightarrow\infty$. One could say, the coupled entropy allows scientists, engineers, and analysts to eat their porridge, confident that its measure of uncertainty reflects the mathematical physics of the scale of non-exponential distributions while minimizing the dependence on the shape or nonlinear coupling. Examples of complex systems design including a coupled variation inference algorithm are reviewed.

Title: Windowing in terahertz time-domain spectroscopy: resolving resonances in thin-film samples
Authors: Esteban Marulanda, Fernanda L. Costa, Nicolas M. Kawahala, Felix G. G. Hernandez
Abstract: Terahertz time-domain spectroscopy (THz-TDS) has become a powerful tool for investigating the optical properties of thin films, offering direct access to the complex permittivity in the terahertz range. However, in transmission-based measurements of thin films on thick substrates, multiple reflections and limited time windows can introduce artifacts that obscure resonant features such as phonon modes. Time-domain windowing remains one of the most widely adopted strategies to mitigate these effects, yet systematic guidelines on its application remain scarce. In this work, we organize a practical routine for extracting the complex permittivity from THz-TDS data, focusing on when and how to apply time-domain windowing. The routine incorporates decision points for truncation versus smooth apodization, and emphasizes tailoring the window length and shape to specific signal conditions. We demonstrate the approach using representative measurements on PbTe thin films, highlighting cases in which truncation suffices, where apodization is essential, and how different window functions and lengths influence the resulting spectra. We also propose simple metrics to assess signal continuity and guide window selection. Although other analysis techniques exist, including parametric spectral estimation, this study focuses on formalizing windowing-based processing into an accessible experimental workflow. Our results show that the choice of window parameters can significantly affect the accuracy of extracted material parameters, particularly for sharply resonant systems. This work provides an accessible framework for improving spectral fidelity in THz-TDS of thin-film samples.

Title: What is emergence, after all?
Authors: Abbas K. Rizi
Abstract: The term emergence is increasingly used across scientific disciplines to describe phenomena that arise from interactions among a system's components but cannot be readily inferred by examining those components in isolation. While often invoked to explain higher-level behaviors, such as flocking, synchronization, or collective intelligence, the term is frequently used without precision, sometimes giving rise to ambiguity or even mystique. In this perspective paper, we clarify the scientific meaning of emergence as a measurable, physically grounded phenomenon. Through concrete examples, such as temperature, magnetism, and herd immunity in social networks, we review how collective behavior can arise from local interactions that are constrained by global boundaries. By disentangling emergence from vague overuse, we emphasize its role as a rigorous tool for understanding complex systems. Our goal is to show that emergence, when properly framed, offers not mysticism but insight.

Title: Upper bounds for the connective constant of weighted self-avoiding walks
Authors: Qidong He
Abstract: Building on an earlier work by Alm, we consider a model of weighted self-avoiding walks on a generic lattice and develop a method for computing upper bounds on the corresponding weighted connective constant, which we implement in a publicly available software package. The bounds are obtained as the dominant eigenvalues of certain matrices and provide detailed information about the convergence of the model's multivariate generating function. We discuss potential applications of our results to developing Peierls-type estimates for anisotropic contour models in statistical physics, generalizing a technique recently introduced by Fahrbach--Randall.

Title: Charge sensitivity in the transmon regime
Authors: Rocio Gonzalez-Meza, Vito Iaia, Anika Zaman, Hiu-Yung Wong, Yujin Cho, Kristin Beck, Yaniv J. Rosen
Abstract: Transmons are widely adopted in quantum computing architectures for their engineered insensitivity to charge noise and correspondingly long relaxation times. Despite this advantage, transmons often exhibit large fluctuations in dephasing times across different devices and also within qubits on the same device. Existing transmon qubits are assumed to be insensitive to charge noise. However, very little recent attention has been paid to the dependence of dephasing on the local charge environment. In this study, we see fluctuations in the dephasing time, $T_{\phi}$, which correlate to charge offset. While charge offset fluctuations are slow, parity switches are fast processes tied to the charge offset and can affect $T_{\phi}$ in Ramsey experiments. We implement a protocol to detect parity switching events using single-shot methods, which are interleaved within a Ramsey measurement. We find that events that remain in the same parity state have a higher $T_2$ than measurements averaged over both parities. Our results show that transmons can be limited by charge-noise, even with $E_\text{J}/E_\text{C} \approx 50$. Consequently, parity flip rates must be considered as a device characterization metric.

Title: Generalization of anomaly formula for time reversal symmetry in (2+1)D abelian bosonic TQFTs
Authors: Ippo Orii
Abstract: We study time-reversal symmetry in (2+1)-dimensional abelian bosonic topological phases. Z_2 x Z_2 classifies the time-reversal anomalies in such systems symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in (3+1) dimensions and can be diagnosed via partition functions on manifolds such as RP^4 and CP^2. These partition functions are related by an anomaly formula of the form Z(RP^4) * Z(CP^2) = theta_M, where theta_M is the Dehn twist phase associated with the crosscap state. Meanwhile, the existence of gapped boundaries is constrained by so-called higher central charges, denoted xi_n, which serve as computable invariants encoding obstruction data. Motivated by the known relation Z(CP^2) = xi_1, we propose a generalization of the anomaly formula involving both the higher central charges xi_n and a new time-reversal invariant eta_n. By introducing a distinguished subset M^n of the set A of anyons, we establish the relation eta_n * xi_n = (sum of theta(a)^n over a in M^n) divided by its absolute value. This generalizes the known anomaly formula. We analyze the algebraic structure of the subset M^n, derive consistency relations it satisfies, and clarify its connection to the original anomaly formula.

Title: Mind the Gap: From Resolving Theoretical Foundations of Chiral(ity)-Induced Spin Selectivity to Pioneering Implementations in Quantum Sensing
Authors: Yan Xi Foo, Aisha Kermiche, Farhan T. Chowdhury, Clarice D. Aiello, Luke D. Smith
Abstract: The chiral(ity)-induced spin selectivity (CISS) effect, where electrons passing through a chiral medium acquire significant spin-polarization at ambient temperatures, has been widely observed experimentally, yet its theoretical foundations remain actively debated. Open questions persist regarding whether CISS originates from helical geometry or more general chirality, and whether a unified mechanism can account for phenomena across solid-state and soft-matter systems, mesoscopic films, and single molecules. Clarifying the interrelations between existing models is essential to determine if a universal picture of CISS can be found or whether system-specific models are required, and if so, where their common starting point should lie for a workable classification of CISS manifestations. Despite this theoretical fragmentation, recent studies of CISS effects in electron transfer systems, magnetic field sensitivity and coherence of radical pair reactions, polarized electroluminescence in chiral hybrid perovskites, DNA-based biosensors, and enantioselective detection, highlight its broad conceptual relevance and potential applications in spintronics, molecular sensors, and quantum information processing. In this review, we help bridge the gap between theory, experiment, and implementation, with a particular focus on prospects for quantum sensing and metrology. We outline fundamental frameworks of CISS, clarifying what constitutes the `chiral', the `induced', and the `spin-selectivity' that makes up CISS, before going on to survey key model realizations and their assumptions. We examine some of the emerging quantum sensing applications and assess the model-specific implications, in particular exemplifying these in the context of spin-correlated radical pairs, which offer a promising, tunable, and biomimetic platform for emerging molecular quantum technologies.
