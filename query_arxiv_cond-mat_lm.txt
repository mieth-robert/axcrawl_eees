Title: Dielectrophoretic response and electro-deformation of soft bioparticles interacting with a metallo-dielectric Janus active particle
Authors: Donggang Cao, Gilad Yossifon
Abstract: Active (self-propelling) particles have emerged as innovative microscale tools in the field of single cell analysis with the advantages of being untethered, remotely controlled, hybrid powered, with sub-cellular precision. This study investigates the dielectrophoretic (DEP) response and electro-mechanical deformation of cell nuclei interacting with active metallo-dielectric Janus Particles (JPs) under an externally applied electric field. An equivalent droplet two-phase model is employed to simulate the bioparticle, coupling the Navier-Stokes equations with the Phase Field Model to capture fluid motion and interface dynamics. Good qualitative agreement is obtained among experimental, analytical, and numerical results. The findings reveal a nonlinear relationship between nucleus deformation and its surface coverage of the JP with respect to the applied voltage. The overall coverage ratio of the JP dielectric hemisphere increases with voltage as the positive DEP force on the dielectric side strengthens, exhibiting maximum at a certain voltage. The strong correlation between nucleus flexibility and JP surface coverage suggests that the JP coverage ratio could serve as a biomechanical marker for nucleus deformability, providing a novel method for in-situ evaluation of nucleus mechanics.

Title: Thermodynamics for an electron gas in a uniform magnetic field in nonextensive statistics
Authors: Bienvenu Gnim Adewi, Isiaka Aremua, Laure Gouba
Abstract: This work deals with the physical system governed by a Hamiltonian operator, in two-dimensional space, of spinless charged particles subject to a perpendicular magnetic field B, coupled with a harmonic potential in the context of nonextensive statistical thermodynamics. The thermodynamics of such a quantum gas system is elaborated in the framework of Tsallis statistics by obtaining the q versions of the partition function, magnetization, and susceptibility after performing the Hilhorst integral transformation. The results are discussed in the q $\mapsto$ 1 limit.

Title: Acoustic topological Jackiw-Rebbi states at symmetry broken interfaces
Authors: Yifei Xia, An Chen, Ting Zhang, Jing Yang, Bin Liang, Johan Christensen, Jianchun Cheng
Abstract: Topological insulators, a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics, support localized states at the interfaces between insulators exhibiting different topological phases, which conventionally rely on explicit symmetry breaking. Here, we propose a mechanism to induce a real-space topological phase transition by spontaneous symmetry breaking, thereby constructing an acoustic metagrating to generate nontrivial Jackiw-Rebbi states characterized by robust imaginary band degeneracy. Our experimental implementation verifies the acoustic delocalized interface state with a constant phase jump, demonstrating enhanced high-directivity topological radiation. We foresee that our findings may spark interest in engineering new acoustic topological devices.

Title: Learning the Position of Image Vortices from Data
Authors: Ryan Doran
Abstract: The point vortex model is an idealized model for describing the dynamics of many vortices with numerical efficiency, and has been shown to be powerful in modeling the dynamics of vortices in a superfluid. The model can be extended to describe vortices in fluids with a well defined boundary, as an image vortex can be added to the equations of motion to impose the correct velocity profile at the boundary. The mathematical formulation of the image vortex depends on the boundary in question, and is well known for a wide variety of problems, although the formulation of an image vortex in a fluid with a soft boundary remains under debate, as the boundary condition is ill-posed. Such a boundary is common-place in the dynamics of a vortex in an ultra-cold atomic Bose-Einstein condensate, for example, which is typically trapped in a harmonic potential. In order to address this problem, the Sparse Identification of Nonlinear Dynamics framework is applied to data from mean-field simulations to extract an approximate point vortex model for a vortex in a circular power law trapping potential. A formulation for the position of an image vortex in such a trap is presented, and the accuracy of this model is evaluated.

Title: Multiscale modelling of thermally stressed superelastic polyimide
Authors: Jerome Samuel S, Puneet Kumar Patra, Md Rushdie Ibne Islam
Abstract: Many thermo-mechanical processes, such as thermal expansion and stress relaxation, originate at the atomistic scale. We develop a sequential multiscale approach to study thermally stressed superelastic polyimide to explore these effects. The continuum-scale smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) model is coupled with atomistic molecular dynamics (MD) through constitutive modelling, where thermo-mechanical properties and equations of state are derived from MD simulations. The results are verified through benchmark problems of heat transfer. Finally, we analyse the insulating capabilities of superelastic polyimide by simulating the thermal response of an aluminium plate. The result shows a considerable reduction in the thermal stress, strain and temperature field development in the aluminium plate when superelastic polyimide is used as an insulator. The present work demonstrates the effectiveness of the multi-scale method in capturing thermo-mechanical interactions in superelastic polyimide.

Title: Paired Parton Trial States for the Superfluid-Fractional Chern Insulator Transition
Authors: Tevž Lotrič, Steven H. Simon
Abstract: We consider a model of hard-core bosons on a lattice, half-filling a Chern band such that the system has a continuous transition between a fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and a superfluid state (SF) depending on the bandwidth to bandspacing ratio. We construct a parton-inspired trial wavefunction ansatz for the ground states that has remarkably high overlap with exact diagonalization in both phases and throughout the phase transition. Our ansatz is stable to adding some bosonic interactions beyond the on-site hard core constraint. We confirm that the transition is well described by a projective translation symmetry-protected multiple parton band gap closure, as has been previously predicted. However, unlike prior work, we find that our wavefunctions require anomalous (BCS-like) parton correlations to describe the phase transition and SF phase accurately.

Title: Multi-Band Exact Diagonalization and an Iteration Approach to Hunt For Fractional Chern Insulators in Rhombohedral Multilayer Graphene
Authors: Heqiu Li, B. Andrei Bernevig, Nicolas Regnault
Abstract: We perform a multi-band exact diagonalization (ED) study of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene twisted on hexagonal boron nitride with a focus on fractional Chern insulators (FCI) in systems with weak moiré gaps, complementing the results of [Yu et al., arXiv:2407.13770]. We consider both the charge-neutrality (CN) and average (AVE) interaction schemes. Saliently and surprisingly, we now find using the particle entanglement spectrum that the FCI at filling factor 1/3 in the CN scheme predicted by single-(Hartree-Fock) band ED is unstable towards a transition to charge density wave once a small fraction of electrons is allowed to occupy the higher bands. Meanwhile, the FCI at filling 2/3 in the AVE scheme remains more robust under similar band mixing until being suppressed when increasing band mixing. To tackle truncation errors that arise from including multiple bands in larger system sizes, we propose an ED iteration method that iteratively optimizes the single-particle basis so that the particles in the ground state should reside mainly in the lowest band. Nevertheless, we find that the FCI gap remains absent after convergence when the mixing with higher bands is considered. These findings highlight the delicate sensitivity of FCIs to multi-band effects and the shortcoming of all of the current models to explain the experimental emergence of such phases.

Title: Easy-plane ferromagnetism in single-crystal ErB$_{2}$ at low temperatures
Authors: Christoph Resch, Georg Benka, Andreas Bauer, Christian Pfleiderer
Abstract: We report a study of single crystals of the hexagonal rare-earth diboride ErB$_{2}$ prepared by means of the self-adjusted flux travelling-solvent floating-zone technique. Measurements of the magnetization, ac susceptibility, specific heat, and electrical resistivity consistently establish ferromagnetic order of the Er$^{3+}$ moments below a second-order phase transition at $T_{c} = 14$~K and a very strong easy-plane anisotropy. Curie--Weiss fits of the ac susceptibility are characteristic of ferromagnetic coupling within the easy hexagonal basal plane, and antiferromagnetic coupling along $\langle001\rangle$. Under magnetic field within the basal plane the magnetization is reminiscent of a soft ferromagnet that is polarized in fields above a few tenth of a Tesla, vanishing hysteresis and negligible in-plane anisotropy. Under field along $\langle001\rangle$, typical hard-axis behavior is observed with the magnetization increasing only weakly up to a spin-flip transition at $\mu_{0}H_{c} = 12$~T. The easy-plane anisotropy emerges below a crossover temperature $T_{x} \approx 50$~K , i.e. a broad paramagnetic temperature range above $T_{c}$ is governed by strongly anisotropic magnetic fluctuations.

Title: Shot-noise in strongly-correlated double quantum spin Hall edges
Authors: Andreas Tsantilas, Trithep Devakul, Julian May-Mann
Abstract: We consider the effects of interactions on the edges of ``double" quantum spin Hall insulators (DQSHIs), motivated by recent experiments on moiré twisted metal dichalcogenides. Without interactions, a DQSHI can be understood as two identical copies of a conventional quantum spin Hall insulator. If interactions are present and $s^z$-spin is conserved, we show that there are two possible phases for the DQSHI edge. First is a weakly-correlated edge which has two pairs of helical modes and is adiabatically equivalent to two conventional quantum spin Hall edges. Second is a strongly-correlated edge with only one pair of helical modes. The strongly-correlated edge also has a gap to single-electrons, but is gapless to pairs of electrons. In a quantum point contact geometry, this single-electron gap leads to a Fano factor of $2$ in shot noise measurements, compared to a Fano factor of $1$ for a weakly-correlated edge.

Title: Gyrotropic magnetic effect in metallic chiral magnets
Authors: Nisarga Paul, Takamori Park, Jung Hoon Han, Leon Balents
Abstract: We study the gyrotropic magnetic effect (GME), the low-frequency limit of optical gyrotropy, in metals and semimetals coupled to chiral spin textures. In these systems, the chiral spin texture which lacks inversion symmetry can imprint itself upon the electronic structure through Hund's coupling, leading to novel low-frequency optical activity. Using perturbation theory and numerical diagonalization of both relativistic and non-relativistic models of conduction electrons coupled to spin textures, we analyze how the GME manifests in both single-$q$ and multi-$q$ textures. Analytical expressions for the rotatory power are derived in terms of universal scaling functions. Estimates based on realistic material parameters reveal an experimentally viable range of values for the rotatory power. The GME arises from the orbital and spin magnetic moments of conduction electrons, with the orbital part closely tied to Berry curvature and playing a significant role in relativistic metals but not so in non-relativistic metals where there is no inherent Berry curvature. The spin contribution to the GME can be significant in non-relativistic metals with a large Fermi energy. Our work establishes the GME as a sensitive probe of magnetic chirality and symmetry breaking in metallic chiral magnets.

Title: Terahertz Landau level spectroscopy of Dirac fermions in millimeter-scale twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: Benjamin F. Mead, Spenser Talkington, An-Hsi Chen, Debarghya Mallick, Zhaodong Chu, Xingyue Han, Seong-Jun Yang, Cheol-Joo Kim, Matthew Brahlek, Eugene J. Mele, Liang Wu
Abstract: Exotic electronic physics including correlated insulating states and fractional Chern insulators have been observed in twisted bilayer graphene in a magnetic field when the Fermi velocity vanishes, however a question remains as to the stability of these states which is controlled by the gap to the first excited state. Free-space terahertz magneto-optics can directly probe the gap to charge excitations which bounds the stability of electronic states, but this measurement has thus-far been inaccessible due to the micron size of twisted bilayer graphene samples, while the wavelength of terahertz light is up to a millimeter. Here we leverage advances in fabrication to create twisted bilayer graphene samples over 5 mm x 5 mm in size with a uniform twist angle and study the magnetic field dependence of the cyclotron resonance by a complex Faraday rotation experiment in p-doped large angle twisted bilayer graphene. These measurements directly probe charge excitations in inter-Landau level transitions and determine the Fermi velocity as a function of twist angle.

Title: Unconventional magnetization in the multiphase superconductor PdBi2
Authors: Wenjun Kuang, Ziyi Jiang, Lewis Powell, Sofiia Komrakova, Andre K. Geim, Irina V. Grigorieva
Abstract: Unconventional superconductors have specific signatures in their magnetic properties, such as intrinsic magnetization at interfaces and around defects and fractional and multiquanta vortices, with much attention focused on heavy fermion and high-T_c superconductors. Here we report an observation of highly anomalous magnetization in a candidate topological superconductor beta-PdBi2, a layered material where hidden inversion symmetry breaking leads to spin polarization and spin-momentum locking of the electronic bands. We observe strictly linear, non-hysteretic dc magnetization, a transition to sharply reduced ac susceptibility vs the magnetic field H applied parallel to the ab plane, and a strong anisotropy between in-plane and out-of-plane H. Based on our earlier finding of a magnetic-field induced phase transition from s-wave to nodal p-wave superconductivity in the tunnelling spectra of PdBi2, we propose that this unusual behavior can be explained by a transition from a conventional vortex structure in low-H s-wave phase to a domain structure corresponding to spatial phase separation into superconducting (nodal p-wave) and normal domains, identifying new features of magnetization that can arise from the multiplicity of superconducting phases.

Title: Phase-locking in dynamical systems and quantum mechanics
Authors: Artem Alexandrov, Alexey Glutsyuk, Alexander Gorsky
Abstract: In this study, we discuss the Prufer transform that connects the dynamical system on the torus and the Hill equation, which is interpreted as either the equation of motion for the parametric oscillator or the Schrodinger equation with periodic potential. The structure of phase-locking domains in the dynamical system on torus is mapped into the band-gap structure of the Hill equation. For the parametric oscillator, we provide the relation between the non-adiabatic Hannay angle and the Poincare rotation number of the corresponding dynamical system. In terms of quantum mechanics, the integer rotation number is connected to the quantization number via the Milne quantization approach and exact WKB. Using recent results concerning the exact WKB approach in quantum mechanics, we discuss the possible non-perturbative effects in the dynamical systems on the torus and for parametric oscillator. The semiclassical WKB is interpreted in the framework of a slow-fast dynamical system. The link between the classification of the coadjoint Virasoro orbits and the Hill equation yields a classification of the phase-locking domains in the parameter space in terms of the classification of Virasoro orbits. Our picture is supported by numerical simulations for the model of the Josephson junction and Mathieu equation.

Title: Hinge electronic structure of strained half-Heuslers
Authors: Sanjib Kumar Das, Ion Cosma Fulga, Rakshanda Dhawan, Hem C. Kandpal, Jeroen van den Brink, Jorge I. Facio
Abstract: Half-Heusler compounds are a class of materials with great potential for the study of distinct electronic states. In this work, we investigate, from first-principles, the possibility of hinge modes in closely related topological phases that are tunable by moderate uni-axial strain. We consider two compounds: LiSbZn and LiBiZn. While LiSbZn has a topologically trivial band structure, the larger spin-orbit coupling of Bi causes a band inversion in LiBiZn. We predict the existence of topologically trivial hinge states in both cases. The hinge modes are affected by both the crystal termination, and the bulk topological phase transitions, albeit indirectly: when present, topological surface modes hybridize with the hinge states and obscure their visibility. Thus, we find that the most visible hinge modes occur when no band inversions are present in the material. Our work highlights the interplay and competition between surface and hinge modes in half-Heuslers, and may help guide the experimental search for robust boundary signatures in these materials

Title: Texture evolution during the development of turbulence in a trapped atomic superfluid
Authors: Michelle A. Moreno-Armijos, Leandro Machado, Arnol D. García-Orozco, Sarah Sab, Amilson R. Fritsch, Vanderlei S. Bagnato
Abstract: Understanding the temporal evolution of out-of-equilibrium systems, such as turbulent Bose-Einstein condensates, remains a significant challenge. Identifying characteristic timescales is crucial for describing this process, since interactions between excitations drive an energy cascade from large to small scales, influencing the evolution of the distribution and magnitude of density fluctuations in real and momentum space. Motivated by these considerations, we investigate the use of density texture as a potential tool to characterize the temporal evolution of turbulence. Our experiment and simulations demonstrate this approach and include an estimate of the characteristic time for texture relaxation.

Title: Nucleation of dislocations in metals: order parameters, transition state, and kinetic rates
Authors: Mattia Perrone, David D. Girardier, Giovanni M. Pavan, Fabio Pietrucci
Abstract: Dislocations are prominent defects in metals, significantly influencing their mechanical, electronic, thermal, and chemical properties. The emergence of such collective defects is typically characterized by nucleation and amplification phases. However, while their dynamical propagation can be followed in great detail, e.g., via atomistic simulations, accurately characterizing the mechanism, transition state, and kinetic rates of dislocations' nucleation is still a fundamental challenge. One main problem is that identifying well-suited descriptor(s) (order parameter) for characterizing the nucleation process is non-trivial, and a rigorous approach to assess and rank descriptors in this sense is still missing. In this work, we investigate the nucleation of dislocations in an ideal fcc copper crystal using replicated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations starting from configurations of the lattice close to the limit between the elastic and the plastic phases. Using different types of descriptors (order parameters), we obtain from the atomistic trajectories time-series data that we study via committor analyses and statistical inference methods. Our findings highlight the effect of the order parameter's choice on the description of the nucleation phenomenon. By applying a recently-demonstrated variational principle to stochastic models built on our data, we estimate the free-energy barriers and kinetic rates for dislocation nucleation. Systematic comparison with the "ground truth" (brute force) nucleation rate then provides us a robust approach for ranking the order parameters based on their accuracy in describing the dislocation nucleation process in this copper crystalline system. This approach is general and useful for probing the transition state and studying nucleation events in a variety of other systems.

Title: Magnons in the strained Heisenberg-Kitaev magnet
Authors: Miguel Letelier, Roberto E. Troncoso, Nicolas Vidal-Silva
Abstract: The properties of magnons hosted in strained Heisenberg-Kitaev magnets are investigated using numerical and analytical calculations. Considering that deformation fields modulate the coupling parameters, we find a general expression for the weakly strained magnon Hamiltonian that depends on the (symmetric) strain tensor. We numerically tested our results in finite nanoribbon structures. We found that uniaxial deformations make the bulk bands more dispersive while topologically protected in-gap edge modes become nonreciprocal at the boundary of the Brillouin Zone. On the other hand, when applying a twist deformation, the simultaneous modulation of both Heisenberg and Kitaev parameters enables the apparition of flat bands, promoting the presence of non-propagative topologically protected magnonic edge states, whose properties strongly depends on the strain strength. In addition, the characteristic localization of magnon edge modes is preserved, which allows for testing the robustness of the bulk-boundary correspondence under lattice deformations. Our results contribute to a major understanding of Heisenberg-Kitaev magnets and how applying different strains allows for precise control over magnon properties.

Title: Density Functional Tight-Binding Enables Tractable Studies of Quantum Plasmonics
Authors: Nikhil S. Chellam, Subhajyoti Chaudhuri, Abhisek Ghosal, Sajal K. Giri, George C. Schatz
Abstract: Routine investigations of plasmonic phenomena at the quantum level present a formidable computational challenge due to the large system sizes and ultrafast timescales involved. This Feature Article highlights the use of density functional tight-binding (DFTB), particularly its real-time time-dependent formulation (RT-TDDFTB), as a tractable approach to study plasmonic nanostructures from a purely quantum mechanical purview. We begin by outlining the theoretical framework and limitations of DFTB, emphasizing its efficiency in modeling systems with thousands of atoms over picosecond timescales. Applications of RT-TDDFTB are then explored in the context of optical absorption, nonlinear harmonic generation, and plasmon-mediated photocatalysis. We demonstrate how DFTB can reconcile classical and quantum descriptions of plasmonic behavior, capturing key phenomena such as size-dependent plasmon shifts and plasmon coupling in nanoparticle assemblies. Finally, we showcase DFTB's ability to model hot carrier generation and reaction dynamics in plasmon-driven \ch{H2} dissociation, underscoring its potential to model photocatalytic processes. Collectively, these studies establish DFTB as a powerful, yet computationally efficient tool to probe the emergent physics of materials at the limits of space and time.

Title: Force chain dynamics in a quasi-static granular pile
Authors: Benjamin Allen, Nicholas W. Hayman
Abstract: In nature, granular materials fail in abrupt avalanches, earthquakes, and other hazardous events, and also creep over time. Proposed failure mechanisms for these systems are broadly framed as friction-limited. However, mechanical descriptions of friction in granular system vary, including those that consider the non-linear, heterogeneous dynamics of grain-contact forces. In order to study granular controls on failure and creep, we imaged contact forces between quasi-2D photoelastic discs at 15-minute intervals in experiments over weeks- to one-month-long observation periods. In the experiments, the particles are distributed in a slope below the angle of repose with a concomitant establishment of the force-chain network approximately along the principal static stress directions. The discrete force-chain shifts are initially described by an age-weakening Weibull distribution in frequency over time, with the most common clusters of events $<$1000 minutes apart, but there are long quiescent periods that are not well described by the distribution. The post-settling discrete events accompany a longer term strengthening of the localized stresses. We observe that some events may be related to 2$^o$C temperature change, but associated ground motions measured by a seismometer appear to have no correlation with particle displacements or force-chain changes. The results illustrate that local, grain-scale changes in force-chain networks can occur long after a granular pile reaches a mesoscale apparently stable state, sometimes without obvious external forcings or imposed state changes. Such force-chain dynamics may underlie transitions in natural granular systems between large-scale failures and creep events.

Title: Impact of Broken Inversion Symmetry on Molecular States in multi-Weyl fermions
Authors: W.C. Silva, J.E. Sanches, D.S. Rojo, L. Squillante, M. de Souza, M.S. Figueira, I.A. Shelykh, E. Marinho Jr., A.C. Seridonio
Abstract: We study inversion-symmetry (IS) breaking in impurity dimers coupled to topological multi-Weyl systems in the low-energy dispersion domain. In the IS-preserved multi-Weyl semimetal phase, Hubbard bands split into symmetric and antisymmetric molecular-like subbands. Breaking IS induces a transition to a multi-Weyl metal, lifting the degeneracy of the Weyl node and closing the pseudogap. This causes opposite energy shifts: valence-band symmetric (antisymmetric) subbands red- (blue-) shift, reversing in the conduction band until a degeneracy point. Beyond this threshold, symmetric bands flatten near band cutoffs, whereas antisymmetric bands form quasi-zero energy modes asymptotically approaching -yet never crossing- the Fermi level. Crucially, identical molecular symmetries maintain nondegeneracy even as energy separation vanishes with stronger IS breaking. Our results demonstrate symmetry-selective mechanisms for topological molecular states in multi-Weyl systems.

Title: On-chip calibrated radio-frequency measurement at cryogenic temperatures for determination of SrTiO3-based capacitor properties
Authors: Akitomi Shirachi, Motoya Shinozaki, Yasuhide Tomioka, Hisashi Inoue, Kenta Itoh, Yusuke Kozuka, Takanobu Watanabe, Shoichi Sato, Takeshi Kumasaka, Tomohiro Otsuka
Abstract: Quantum computing has emerged as a promising technology for next-generation information processing, utilizing semiconductor quantum dots as one of the candidates for quantum bits. Radio-frequency (rf) reflectometry plays an important role in the readout of quantum dots but requires a precise rf measurement technique at cryogenic temperatures. While cryogenic calibration techniques, essential for rf reflectometry, have been developed, on-chip calibration near the device remains an important challenge. In this study, we develop an on-chip calibrated rf measurement system operating at 4K for characterizing SrTiO3-based varactors, which are promising components for tunable impedance matching circuits. Our system enables accurate measurements by eliminating errors associated with long rf circuit lines. We investigate the effects of annealing conditions, crystal orientation, and Ca doping of SrTiO3 crystals on the varactor properties in the frequency range for rf reflectometry. Our results provide insights for optimizing these components for cryogenic rf applications in quantum information processing systems.

Title: Ant Colony Optimization for Density Functionals in Strongly Correlated Systems
Authors: G. M. Tonin, T. Pauletti, R. M. Dos Santos, V. V. França
Abstract: The Ant Colony Optimization (ACO) algorithm is a nature-inspired metaheuristic method used for optimization problems. Although not a machine learning method per se, ACO is often employed alongside machine learning models to enhance performance through optimization. We adapt an ACO algorithm to optimize the so-called FVC density functional for the ground-state energy of strongly correlated systems. We find the parameter configurations that maximize optimization efficiency, while reducing the mean relative error ($MRE$) of the ACO functional. We then analyze the algorithm's performance across different dimensionalities ($1D-5D$), which are related to the number of parameters to be optimized within the FVC functional. Our results indicate that $15$ ants with a pheromone evaporation rate superior to $0.2$ are sufficient to minimize the $MRE$ for a vast regime of parameters of the strongly-correlated system -- interaction, particle density and spin magnetization. While the optimizations $1D$, $2D$, and $4D$ yield $1.5\%< MRE< 2.7\%$, the $3D$ and $5D$ optimizations lower the $MRE$ to $\sim0.8\%$, reflecting a $67\%$ error reduction compared to the original FVC functional ($MRE = 2.4\%$). As simulation time grows almost linearly with dimension, our results highlight the potential of ant colony algorithms for density-functional problems, combining effectiveness with low computational cost.

Title: Spin-Exchange Induced Spillover on Poor Man's Majoranas in Minimal Kitaev Chains
Authors: J.E. Sanches, L.T. Lustosa, L.S. Ricco, H. Sigurðsson, M. de Souza, M.S. Figueira, E. Marinho Jr., A.C. Seridonio
Abstract: The "Poor Man's Majoranas" (PMMs) [Phys. Rev. B 86, 134528 (2012)] devoid of topological protection can "spill over" from one edge into another of the minimal Kitaev chain when perturbed electrostatically. As aftermath, this leads to a delocalized Majorana fermion (MF) at both the edges. Additionally, according to recent differential conductance measurements in a pair of superconducting and spinless quantum dots (QDs), such a PMM picture was brought to reality [Nature 614, 445 (2023) and Nature 630, 329 (2024)]. Based on this scenario, we propose the spillover of the PMM when its QD is exchange coupled to a quantum spin $S$. We show that if this QD is perturbed by the exchange coupling $J$, solely the half $2S+1$ $(2S+2)$ of the fine structure stays explicit for a fermionic (bosonic) $S.$ Concurrently, the other half squeezes itself as the delocalized MF zero-mode. Particularly, turning-off the superconductivity the multiplicity $2S+1$ holds regardless the spin statistics. Meanwhile, the PMM spillover induced by $J$ becomes a statistics dependent effect. Hence, our findings contribute to the comprehension of spin-phenomena interplay with superconductivity in minimal Kitaev chains, offering insights for future quantum computing devices hosting PMMs.

Title: 2D Active Brownian run-and-tumble particles moment analysis
Authors: Aoran Sun, Da Wei, Yiyu Zhang, Fangfu Ye, Rudolf Podgornik
Abstract: We study an active Brownian run-and-tumble particle (ABRTP) model, that consists of an active Brownian run state during which the active velocity of the particle diffuses on the unit circle, and a tumble state during which the active velocity is zero, both with exponentially distributed time. Additionally we add a harmonic trap as an external potential. In the appropriate limits the ABRTP model reduces either to the active Brownian particle model, or the run-and-tumble particle model. Using the method of direct integration the equation of motion, pioneered by Kac, we obtain exact moments for the Laplace transform of the time dependent ABRTP, in the presence or absence of a harmonic trap. In addition we estimate the distribution moments with the help of the Chebyshev polynomials. Our results are in excellent agreement with the experiments.

Title: Sparse mixed linear modeling with anchor-based guidance for high-entropy alloy discovery
Authors: Ryo Murakami, Seiji Miura, Akihiro Endo, Satoshi Minamoto
Abstract: High-entropy alloys have attracted attention for their exceptional mechanical properties and thermal stability. However, the combinatorial explosion in the number of possible elemental compositions renders traditional trial-and-error experimental approaches highly inefficient for materials discovery. To solve this problem, machine learning techniques have been increasingly employed for property prediction and high-throughput screening. Nevertheless, highly accurate nonlinear models often suffer from a lack of interpretability, which is a major limitation. In this study, we focus on local data structures that emerge from the greedy search behavior inherent to experimental data acquisition. By introducing a linear and low-dimensional mixture regression model, we strike a balance between predictive performance and model interpretability. In addition, we develop an algorithm that simultaneously performs prediction and feature selection by considering multiple candidate descriptors. Through a case study on high-entropy alloys, this study introduces a method that combines anchor-guided clustering and sparse linear modeling to address biased data structures arising from greedy exploration in materials science.

Title: Hydrostatic equilibrium in multi-Weyl semimetals
Authors: Jewel Kumar Ghosh, Francisco Peña-Benítez, Patricio Salgado-Rebolledo
Abstract: We study the hydrostatic equilibrium of multi-Weyl semimetals, a class of systems with Weyl-like quasi-particles but anisotropic dispersion relation $\omega^2 \sim k_\parallel^2 + k_\perp^{2n}$, with $n$ a possitive integer. A characteristic feature of multi-Weyl systems is the lack of Lorentz invariance, instead, they possess the reduced spacetime symmetry $(SO(1,1)\times SO(2))\ltimes \mathbb R^4$. In this work we propose a covariant formulation for the low energy theory, allowing for a minimal coupling of the fermion field to external geometric background and $U(1)$ gauge field. The non-Lorentzian structure of the field theory demands introducing an Aristotelian spacetime analogous to the so-called stringy Newton-Cartan geometry \cite{Andringa:2012uz}. Our proposal allows for a systematic study of the hydrostatic properties via the derivation of the partition function of the system. In addition to multi-Weyl models, our formulation can be applied to systems with similar spacetime symmetry groups, such as Bjorken flow.

Title: Quantized resonant tunneling effect in Josephson junctions with ferromagnetic bilayers
Authors: Hao Meng, Xiuqiang Wu, Jiansheng Wu
Abstract: We study the Josephson effect in SF$_1$F$_2$S junctions, which consist of conventional s-wave superconductors (S) connected by two ferromagnets (F$_1$ and F$_2$). At low temperatures, the Josephson critical current displays periodic resonance peaks as exchange fields ($h_1$, $h_2$) and thicknesses ($d_1$, $d_2$) of the F$_1$ and F$_2$ layers vary, provided a potential barrier exists at the F$_1$/F$_2$ interface. These resonance peaks emerge under the quantization conditions $Q_{1(2)}d_{1(2)}=\left(n_{1(2)}+1/2\right)\pi$. Here, $Q_{1(2)} = 2h_{1(2)}/(\hbar v_F)$ represents a center-of-mass momentum carried by Cooper pairs, where $v_F$ is the Fermi velocity and $n_{1(2)} = 0, 1, 2, \cdots$. This critical current feature arises from a resonant tunneling effect induced by spin-triplet pairs with zero spin projection along the magnetization axis. At resonance, the Josephson current primarily originates from the first harmonic in both parallel and antiparallel magnetization configurations, whereas the second harmonic becomes more significant in perpendicular configurations. In cases where both ferromagnetic layers have identical exchange fields and thicknesses, the potential barrier selectively suppresses the current in the 0-state while maintaining it in the $\pi$-state for parallel configurations. Conversely, in antiparallel configurations, the current in the 0-state is consistently preserved.

Title: Emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport in a van der Waals Dirac semimetal/antiferromagnet heterostructure
Authors: Saurav Islam, Max Stanley, Anthony Richardella, Seungjun Lee, Kalana D. Halanayake, Sandra Santhosh, Danielle Reifsnyder Hickey, Tony Low, Nitin Samarth
Abstract: We investigate emergent superconductivity and non-reciprocal transport (magnetochiral anisotropy, superconducting diode effect) at the heterointerface of two non-superconducting van der Waals (vdW) materials, the Dirac semimetal ZrTe$_2$ and the antiferromagnetic iron chalcogenide FeTe, grown using molecular beam epitaxy. We show from electrical transport measurements that two dimensional (2D) superconductivity arises at the heterointerface below temperature $T \sim 12$~K. When capped with a 2D ferromagnet (CrTe$_2$), these heterostructures show a superconducting diode effect with efficiency of about 30\%. With strong spin-orbit coupling in ZrTe$_2$, these epitaxial heterostructures provide an attractive epitaxial vdW platform for exploring unconventional superconductivity in Dirac semimetals and for developing non-reciprocal devices for superconducting electronics.

Title: Deterministic Formation of Single Organic Color Centers in Single-Walled Carbon Nanotubes
Authors: Daichi Kozawa, Yuto Shiota, Yuichiro K. Kato
Abstract: Quantum light sources using single-walled carbon nanotubes show promise for quantum technologies but face challenges in achieving precise control over color center formation. Here we present a novel technique for deterministic creation of single organic color centers in carbon nanotubes using \textit{in-situ} photochemical reaction. By monitoring discrete intensity changes in photoluminescence spectra, we achieve precise control over the formation of individual color centers. Furthermore, our method allows for position-controlled formation of color centers as validated through photoluminescence imaging. We also demonstrate photon antibunching from a color center, confirming the quantum nature of the defects formed. This technique represents a significant step forward in the precise engineering of atomically defined quantum emitters in carbon nanotubes, facilitating their integration into advanced quantum photonic devices and systems.

Title: Tunable Thermal Expansion in Functionalized 2D Boron Nitride: A First-Principles Investigation
Authors: Sk Mujaffar Hossain, Dobin Kim, Jaehyun Park, Seung-Cheol Lee, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: This study investigates the thermal expansion coefficient of two-dimensional (2D) functionalized boron nitride (f-BN) materials using first-principles density functional theory (DFT). Two-dimensional materials, particularly hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN), have attracted significant attention due to their exceptional mechanical, thermal, and electronic properties. However, the influence of functionalization on the thermal expansion behavior remains largely unexplored. In this work, DFT calculations are employed to analyze how different functionalized forms of h-BN impact the thermal expansion of BN sheets. Density functional perturbation theory (DFPT) and the quasiharmonic approximation (QAH) are utilized to determine the thermal expansion coefficient over a range of temperatures. The results reveal that functionalization induces notable modifications in the in-plane thermal expansion of BN, affecting material stability and suggesting potential applications in nanoelectronics and thermal management. This investigation provides critical insights into the tunability of the thermal properties of 2D BN, underscoring its suitability for next-generation flexible and high-performance devices.

Title: Moiré Band Engineering in Twisted Trilayer WSe2
Authors: Naoto Nakatsuji, Takuto Kawakami, Hayato Tateishi, Koichiro Kato, Mikito Koshino
Abstract: We present a systematic theoretical study on the structural and electronic properties of twisted trilayer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) WSe$_2$, where two independent moiré patterns form between adjacent layers. Using a continuum approach, we investigate the optimized lattice structure and the resulting energy band structure, revealing fundamentally different electronic behaviors between helical and alternating twist configurations. In helical trilayers, lattice relaxation induces $\alpha\beta$ and $\beta\alpha$ domains, where the two moiré patterns shift to minimize overlap, while in alternating trilayers, $\alpha\alpha'$ domains emerge with aligned moiré patterns. A key feature of trilayer TMDs is the summation of moiré potentials from the top and bottom layers onto the middle layer, effectively doubling the potential depth. In helical trilayers, this mechanism generates a Kagome lattice potential in the $\alpha\beta$ domains, giving rise to flat bands characteristic of Kagome physics. In alternating trilayers, the enhanced potential confinement forms deep triangular quantum wells, distinct from those found in bilayer systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a moderate perpendicular electric field can switch the layer polarization near the valence band edge, providing an additional degree of tunability. In particular, it enables tuning of the hybridization between orbitals on different layers, allowing for the engineering of diverse and controllable electronic band structures. Our findings highlight the unique role of moiré potential summation in trilayer systems, offering a broader platform for designing moiré-based electronic and excitonic phenomena beyond those achievable in bilayer TMDs.

Title: Exact multiple complex mobility edges and quantum state engineering in coupled 1D quasicystals
Authors: Li Wang, Zhenbo Wang, Jiaqi Liu, Shu Chen
Abstract: The key concept of mobility edge, which marks the critical transition between extended and localized states in energy domain, has attracted significant interest in the cutting-edge frontiers of modern physics due to its profound implications for understanding localization and transport properties in disordered systems. However, a generic way to construct multiple mobility edges (MME) is still ambiguous and lacking. In this work, we propose a brief scheme to engineer both real and complex exact multiple mobility edges exploiting a few coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains. We study the extended-localized transitions of coupled one-dimensional quasiperiodic chains along the chain direction. The model combines both the well-established quasiperiodicity and a kind of freshly introduced staggered non-reciprocity, which are aligned in two mutually perpendicular directions, within a unified framework. Based on analytical analysis, we predict that when the couplings between quasiperiodic chains are weak, the system will be in a mixed phase in which the localized states and extended states coexist and intertwine, thus lacking explicit energy separations. However, as the inter-chain couplings increase to certain strength, exact multiple mobility edges emerge. This prediction is clearly verified by concrete numerical calculations of the Fractal Dimension and the scaling index $\beta$. Moreover, we show that the combination of quasiperiodicity and the staggered non-reciprocity can be utilized to design and realize quantum states of various configurations. Our results reveal a brief and general scheme to implement exact multiple mobility edges for synthetic materials engineering.

Title: Spin-orbital order and excitations in $3d^4$, $4d^4$, and $5d^4$ systems: Application to $\rm BaFeO_3$, $\rm Sr_2RuO_4$, $\rm Sr_2YIrO_6$, and $\rm K_2OsCl_64$
Authors: Shahid Ahmad, Harshvardhan Parmar, Shubhajyoti Mohapatra, Avinash Singh
Abstract: Evolution of composite spin-orbital order and coupled spin-orbital excitations is studied in a variety of $d^4$ systems with $n$=$4$ electrons in the $t_{2g}$ orbital sector using the generalised self-consistent + fluctuations approach for a realistic interacting-electron model. Within this unified approach, applications are discussed to compounds with $3d$, $4d$, $5d$ transition-metal ions such as $\rm BaFeO_3$ ($\rm Fe^{4+}$), $\rm Ca_2RuO_4$ ($\rm Ru^{4+}$), $\rm Sr_2RuO_4$ ($\rm Ru^{4+}$), $\rm Sr_2YIrO_6$ ($\rm Ir^{5+}$), and $\rm K_2OsCl_6$ ($\rm Os^{4+}$). Continuous interpolation from the nominally $S=1$ antiferromagnetic order in $\rm Ca_2RuO_4$ (strong crystal field, intermediate spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and Coulomb interaction) to the $J=0$ state relevant for $5d^4$ compounds (strong SOC, weak Coulomb interaction) and to the half-metallic ferromagnetic order when crystal field is negligible as in $\rm BaFeO_3$ (weak SOC, strong Coulomb interaction) and $\rm Sr_2RuO_4$ (intermediate SOC and Coulomb interaction) provides new fundamental insights into the magnetism of spin-orbit coupled systems.

Title: Self-consistency error correction for accurate machine learning potentials from variational Monte Carlo
Authors: Giacomo Tenti, Kousuke Nakano, Michele Casula
Abstract: Variational Monte Carlo (VMC) can be used to train accurate machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs), enabling molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of complex materials on time scales and for system sizes previously unattainable. VMC training sets are often based on partially optimized wave functions (WFs) to circumvent expensive energy optimizations of the whole set of WF parameters. However, frozen variational parameters lead to VMC forces and pressures not consistent with the underlying potential energy surface, a bias called the self-consistency error (SCE). Here, we demonstrate how the SCE can spoil the accuracy of MLIPs trained on these data, taking high-pressure hydrogen as test case. We then apply a recently introduced SCE correction [ Phys. Rev. B 109, 205151 (2024)] to generate unbiased VMC training sets based on a Jastrow-correlated single determinant WF with frozen Kohn-Sham orbitals. The MLIPs generated within this framework are significantly improved and can approach in quality those trained on datasets built with fully optimized WFs. Our conclusions are further supported by MD simulations, which show how MLIPs trained on SCE-corrected datasets systematically yield more reliable physical observables. Our framework opens the possibility of constructing extended high-quality training sets with VMC.

Title: Laser-induced modulation of the ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase fraction in FeRh films

Abstract: With his huge entropy change and a strong interplay between magnetic order, structural and electrical properties, the first-order antiferromagnetic/ferromagnetic phase transition is a paradigmatic example of the multicaloric effect. The unraveling of the physics underlying the phase transition needs a better understanding of the thermal hysteresis of FeRh within the AF-FM phase coexistence region. In this work, we compare the effect of two very different types of thermal cycling on the hysteresis of the magnetic order: quasi-static heating, and cooling of the entire 195 nm thick film, and a f =100 kHz modulated heating driven by a laser focused down to a spot of about ten micron squared at the film surface. Taking advantage of the reflectivity difference between both phases to probe optically their respective fraction, we show that whereas only temperature-driven reflectivity variations (dR/dT , thermoreflectance) are detected in the pure phases, a huge modulation of the phase-dependent reflectance at the driving frequency f is detected in the phase coexistence temperature range. This is quantitatively described as resulting from a substantial modulation of the FM fraction (up to 90%) with increasing laser power. A simplified rate-independent hysteresis model with return-point-memory (RPM), represented in terms of bistable units that undergo a temperature excursion corresponding to a given laser power, reproduces very well the optically measured FM phase modulation characteristics for a broad range of temperature excursions. This offers an insight into the leading role of quenched disorder in defining thermal hysteresis in FeRh under high excitation frequency, when the material is periodically driven out-of-equilibrium.

Title: Spin Wave Dispersion of the van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$
Authors: Ritesh Das, Rob den Teuling, Artem V. Bondarenko, Elena V. Tartakovskaya, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Jaime Ferrer, Yaroslav M. Blanter
Abstract: We calculate the magnon dispersion spectra of the two-dimensional zigzag van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ for monolayer, bilayer, and bulk systems as a function of an external magnetic field. We calculate the exchange and anisotropy constants in our spin model by first principles. We can accurately explain the transition from a collinear to a canted ground state for a magnetic field applied normal to the (in-plane) easy-axis, and a spin-flop transition when the field is parallel to it. A topologically protected Dirac nodal line is present and robust with respect to both external and anisotropy fields.

Abstract: Spin qubits based on semiconductor quantum dots are a promising prospect for quantum computation because of their high coherence times and gate fidelities. However, scaling up those structures to the numbers required by fault-tolerant quantum computing is currently hampered by a number of issues. One of the main issues is the need for single-shot low-footprint qubit readout. Here, we demonstrate the single-shot in situ measurement of a compact qubit unit-cell. The unit cell is composed of two electron spins with a controllable exchange interaction. We report initialization, single-shot readout and two-electron entangling gate. The unit cell was successfully operated at up to 1 K, with state-of-the-art charge noise levels extracted using free induction decay. With its integrated readout and high stability, this foundry fabricated qubit unit cell demonstrates strong potential for scalable quantum computing architectures.

Title: Collapse of molecular orbital by ultrahigh magnetic fields in V$_6$O$_{13}$
Authors: Yuto Ishii, Akihiko Ikeda, Yasuhiro. H. Matsuda
Abstract: V$_6$O$_{13}$ exhibits the metal-insulator transition (MIT) with vanadium-vanadium (V-V) dimer formation. The magnetostriction of V$_6$O$_{13}$ along the crystallographic $b$-axis has been measured in ultrahigh magnetic fields up to 186 T at several temperatures in this work. The large negative magnetostriction as large as $\Delta L / L \sim10^{-3}$ was observed above 110 T below the transition temperature. Discussion based on experimental results and the physical property of V$_6$O$_{13}$ suggests that the observed large negative magnetostriction corresponds to the collapse of V-V dimer molecular orbital (MO). This is the first case for direct observation of lattice change originating from the magnetic field-induced collapse of V-V dimer MO in vanadium oxides. In addition, the $B$-$T$ phase diagram and the magnitude of magnetostriction indicate that the collapse of V-V dimer MO probably accompanies the insulator-to-metal transition. A large hysteresis that is larger than 50 T was observed, which probably arises from the non-equilibrated cross-correlation of such degrees of freedom as the charge, spin, and lattice. Comparison with the VO$_2$ case suggests the magnetic entropy of the remanent paramagnetic spins in the insulating phase may play an important role for the MIT in V$_6$O$_{13}$.

Title: Electroactive differential growth and delayed instability in accelerated healing tissues
Authors: Yafei Wang, Zhanfeng Li, Xingmei Chen, Yun Tan, Fucheng Wang, Yangkun Du, Yunce Zhang, Yipin Su, Fan Xu, Changguo Wang, Weiqiu Chen, Ji Liu
Abstract: Guided by experiments contrasting electrically accelerated recovery with natural healing, this study formulates a model to investigate the importance of electroactive differential growth and morphological changes in tissue repair. It underscores the clinical potential of leveraging electroactive differential growth for improved healing outcomes. The study reveals that voltage stimulation significantly enhances the healing and growth of biological tissues, accelerating the regeneration process across various growth modalities and steering towards isotropic growth conditions that do not favor any specific growth pathways. Enhancing the electroelastic coupling parameters improves the efficacy of bioelectric devices, initiating contraction and fortification of biological tissues in alignment with the electric field. This process facilitates swift cell migration and proliferation, as well as oriented growth of tissue. In instances of strain stiffening at elevated strains, the extreme critical growth ratio aligns with the predictions of neo-Hookean models. Conversely, for tissues experiencing strain stiffening under moderate to very low strain conditions, the strain stiffening effect substantially delays the onset of electroelastic growth instability, ultimately producing a smooth, hyperelastic surface devoid of any unstable morphologies. Our investigation, grounded in nonlinear electroelastic field and perturbation theories, explores how electric fields influence differential growth and instability in biological tissues. We examine the interactions among dimensionless voltage, internal pressure, electroelastic coupling, radius ratio, and strain stiffening, revealing their effects on promoting growth and delaying instability. This framework offers insights into the mechanisms behind electroactive growth and its instabilities, contributing valuable knowledge to the tissue healing.

Title: A DFT study on 18-crown-6-like-N$_8$ structure as a material for metal-ions storage: stability and performance
Authors: Irina I. Piyanzina, Regina M. Burganova, Sadegh Kaviani, Oleg V. Nedopekin, Hayk Zakaryan
Abstract: Developing electrode materials with exceptional electrical conductivity, robust chemical stability, rapid charge and discharge rates, and high storage capacity is essential for advancing high-performance metal-ion batteries. This study explores the two-dimensional, 18-crown-6-like N8 structure (2D-N8) as a promising electrode material for next-generation rechargeable post-lithium batteries. We thoroughly investigated the pristine N8 structures, focusing on their stability and performance metrics. Our analysis revealed remarkable structural stability across the board. Additionally, electronic calculations indicated a small band gap of 0.54 eV for the N8 monolayer, suggesting favorable electronic properties for battery applications. When we evaluated a series of metal ions as adsorbates, we found that the pristine N8 monolayer achieved an impressive storage capacity of 1675 mAh/g for sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg) ions, highlighting its potential for effective ion storage. Our findings suggest that the engineered 2D-N8 structure offers a unique combination of stability and electrochemical performance that could significantly contribute to developing efficient and durable energy storage technologies.

Title: Hydrodynamics converts chiral flagellar rotation into contactless actuation of microdiscs
Authors: Daniel Grober, Tanumoy Dhar, David Saintillan, Jérémie Palacci
Abstract: Motile bacteria are a wonder of nature's engineering: microscopic engines that transduce biochemical energy into the work they require to explore their environment. This added energy turns the surrounding fluid into a bath that departs from an equilibrium one. Bacterial baths agitate suspended spheres more vividly than thermal fluctuations and can power microscopic ratchets. A salient requirement to extract work from bacterial baths was the asymmetric shape of the ratchets, designed to rectify the interactions with bacteria. In contrast with past results, here we show that swimming E. coli power the persistent rotation of discs, in absence of asymmetry. Combining state-of-the art nanoprinting, quantitative measurements of the dynamics of individual bacteria, and hydrodynamic modeling, we elucidate the mechanism and show that the counter-rotation of the flagella and the bacterium body lead to a torque dipole and traction onto the disc, and subsequent rotation. Remarkably, the mechanism is independent of the direction or orientation of navigation of bacteria under the disc, hence additive and contactless. Resulting from the interplay of the torque dipole of flagellated bacteria with simple geometric confinement, this hydrodynamic mechanism bridges scales, leveraging the chirality of bacteria nanomotors towards the manipulation of objects at least ten thousand times larger. The study lays the groundwork for novel bio-hybrid micromachines that harness living microorganisms for controlled motion at the microscale. Our findings provide further fundamental insights into bacterial hydrodynamics and open avenues for the development of autonomous, self-powered microdiscs for the study of chiral fluids.

Title: Inhomogeneous Diffusion in Confined Colloidal Suspensions
Authors: Gerhard Jung, Alejandro Villada-Balbuena, Thomas Franosch
Abstract: We have performed confocal microscopy experiments and computer simulations of colloidal suspensions with moderate volume fraction confined between two quasi-parallel, rough walls [A. Villada-Balbuena et al., Soft Matter, 2022, 18, 4699-4714]. Here we investigate many facets of the dynamical properties of the system, such as confined and inhomogeneous diffusion, mean first-passage times and generalized incoherent scattering functions. We observe that the experiment features strong footprints of the confinement in the dynamical properties, such as inhomogeneous diffusion coefficients and non-zero off-diagonal elements in the incoherent scattering function which we can quantitatively model and analyze with computer simulations. This allows us, for example, to systematically investigate the impact of surface roughness. Our comparative study therefore advances the fundamental understanding of the impact of confinement on dynamics in fluids and colloidal suspensions.

Title: Microcanonical ensemble out of equilibrium
Authors: Roman Belousov, Jenna Elliott, Florian Berger, Lamberto Rondoni, Anna Erzberger
Abstract: Introduced by Boltzmann under the name "monode," the microcanonical ensemble serves as the fundamental representation of equilibrium thermodynamics in statistical mechanics by counting all realizations of a system's states. Ensemble theory connects this idea with probability and information theory, leading to the notion of Shannon-Gibbs entropy and, ultimately, to the principle of maximum caliber describing trajectories of systems in and out of equilibrium. While the latter generalization reproduces many results of nonequilibrium thermodynamics, given a proper choice of observables, its physical justification remains an open area of research. What is the microscopic origin and physical interpretation of this variational approach? What guides the choice of relevant observables? We address these questions by extending Boltzmann's method to a microcanonical caliber principle and counting realizations of a system's trajectories--all assumed equally probable. Maximizing the microcanonical caliber under the imposed macro- and microscopic constraints, we systematically develop generalized detailed-balance relations, clarify the statistical origins of inhomogeneous transport, and provide an independent derivation of key equations underlying the theories of random walks and stochastic thermodynamics. This approach introduces a dynamical ensemble theory for nonequilibrium steady states in spatially extended and active systems. While verifying the equivalence of ensembles, e.g. those of Norton and Thevenin, our theory highlights differences between nonequilibrium regimes not evident in the traditional formulation of the maximum-caliber principle. We validate our results by stochastic simulations. Our theory suggests further connections to the first principles of microscopic dynamics, which are critical for investigating systems where the conditions for thermodynamic behavior are not satisfied.

Title: Inhomogeneous Phase Stiffness in $2$D $s$-wave Disordered Superconductors
Authors: Sudipta Biswas, A. Taraphder, Sudhansu S. Mandal
Abstract: We investigate the effect of white-noise disorder on the local phase stiffness and thermodynamic properties of a two-dimensional $s$-wave superconductor. Starting from a local attractive model and using path-integral formalism, we derive an effective action by decoupling the superconducting order parameter into amplitude and phase components in a gauge-invariant manner. Perturbative techniques are applied to the phase fluctuation sector to derive an effective phase-only XY model for disordered superconducting systems. Solving the saddle-point Green's function using Bogoliubov-de Gennes theory, we calculate the distributions of nearest-neighbor couplings for various disorder strengths. A single-peak distribution is observed for low disorder strength, which becomes bimodal with one peak at negative couplings as the disorder strength increases. The local phase stiffness remains randomly distributed throughout the lattice and shows no correlation with pairing amplitudes. The temperature dependence of the superfluid stiffness ($J_s$) is studied using Monte Carlo simulations. At strong disorder and low temperatures, $J_s$ increases with increasing temperature, exhibiting anomalous behavior that may indicate the onset of a glassy transition. Additionally, calculations of the Edwards-Anderson order parameter in this disorder regime suggest the emergence of a $phase$-$glass$ state at very low temperatures.

Title: Hamiltonian learning of triplon excitations in an artificial nanoscale molecular quantum magnet
Authors: Rouven Koch, Robert Drost, Peter Liljeroth, Jose L. Lado
Abstract: Extracting the Hamiltonian of nanoscale quantum magnets from experimental measurements is a significant challenge in correlated quantum matter. Here we put forward a machine learning strategy to extract the spin Hamiltonian from inelastic spectroscopy with scanning tunneling microscopy, and we demonstrate this methodology experimentally with an artificial nanoscale molecular magnet based on cobalt phthalocyanine (CoPC) molecules on NbSe$_2$. We show that this technique allows to directly extract the Hamiltonian parameters of a quantum magnet from the differential conductance, including the substrate-induced spatial variation of the different exchange couplings. Our methodology leverages a machine learning algorithm trained on exact quantum many-body simulations with tensor networks of finite quantum magnets, leading to a methodology that can be used to predict the Hamiltonian of CoPC quantum magnets of arbitrary size. Our results demonstrate how quantum many-body methods and machine learning enable learning a microscopic description of nanoscale quantum many-body systems with scanning tunneling spectroscopy.

Title: AIM: A User-friendly GUI Workflow program for Isotherm Fitting, Mixture Prediction, Isosteric Heat of Adsorption Estimation, and Breakthrough Simulation
Authors: Muhammad Hassan, Sunghyun Yoon, Yu Chen, Pilseok Kim, Hongryeol Yun, Hyuk Taek Kwon, Youn-Sang Bae, Chung-Yul Yoo, Dong-Yeun Koh, Chang-Seop Hong, Ki-Bong Lee, Yongchul G. Chung
Abstract: Adsorption breakthrough modeling often requires complex software environments and scripting, limiting accessibility for many practitioners. We present AIM, a MATLAB-based graphical user interface (GUI) application that streamlines fixed-bed adsorption analysis through an integrated workflow for isotherm fitting, heat of adsorption estimation, mixture prediction, and multicomponent breakthrough simulations. AIM's intuitive GUI requires no coding and supports a broad isotherm library (e.g., Langmuir, Toth, Dubinin-Astakhov, Structural-Transition-Adsorption). It also enables non-isothermal breakthrough simulations with axial dispersion. Case studies, such as Xe/Kr breakthrough curves in SBMOF-1, closely match the results from other software applications, such as RUPTURA. Mixture predictions can be done using the Ideal Adsorbed Solution Theory (IAST) and Extended Langmuir models, while isosteric heats are derived from Clausius-Clapeyron or Virial equations. Users can export detailed column and outlet profiles (e.g., composition, temperature) in multiple formats, enhancing reproducibility and data sharing among practitioners.

Title: Frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness and short-range magnetic order in the doped two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: I. A. Goremykin, A. A. Katanin
Abstract: We study doping and temperature dependencies of temporal and spatial spin stiffnesses of the Hubbard model within the mean field approach for incommensurate magnetic order. We show that the frequency dependence of temporal spin stiffness is crucial to obtain small values of correlation length, comparable to those observed in cuprates. Using the obtained spin stiffnesses, we obtain the temperature and doping dependence of correlation length within the large-$N$ limit of the respective nonlinear sigma model. In agreement with the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$ we obtain short range magnetic order with relatively small correlation length at $0.1 \lesssim x\lesssim 0.2$, and magnetically ordered ground state in the narrow doping region $0.05\lesssim x \lesssim 0.1$. The latter state may correspond to the spin-frosen state, observed in the experimental data on La$_{2-x}$Sr$_x$CuO$_4$.

Title: Particle-Hole Asymmetry and Pinball Liquid in a Triangular-Lattice Extended Hubbard Model within Mean-Field Approximation
Authors: Aleksey Alekseev, Agnieszka Cichy, Konrad Jerzy Kapcia
Abstract: Recently, triangular lattice models have received a lot of attention since they can describe a number of strongly-correlated materials that exhibit superconductivity and various magnetic and charge orders. In this research we present an extensive analysis of the charge-ordering phenomenon of the triangular-lattice extended Hubbard model with repulsive onsite and nearest-neighbor interaction, arbitrary charge concentration, and $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ supercell (3-sublattice assumption). The model is solved in the ground state with the mean-field approximation which allowed to identify $8$ charge-ordered phases and a large variety of phase transitions. An exotic pinball-liquid phase was found and described. Moreover, strong particle-hole asymmetry of the phase diagram is found to play an important role for triangular lattices. The analysis of band structures, unavailable for more advanced methods that take into account correlation effects, provided a great insight in the nature of triangular-lattice phases and phase transitions. The complexity of the mean-field phase diagram showed the importance and usefulness of the results for the further research with correlation effects included. Together with atomic-limit approximation it can serve them as both a starting point, and a tool to interpret results.

Title: Nonsymmorphic Topological Phases of Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Daichi Nakamura, Yutaro Tanaka, Ken Shiozaki, Kohei Kawabata
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity appears ubiquitously in various open classical and quantum systems and enriches classification of topological phases. However, the role of nonsymmorphic symmetry, crystalline symmetry accompanying fractional lattice translations, has remained largely unexplored. Here, we systematically classify non-Hermitian topological crystalline phases protected by nonsymmorphic symmetry and reveal unique phases that have no counterparts in either Hermitian topological crystalline phases or non-Hermitian topological phases protected solely by internal symmetry. Specifically, we elucidate the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_4$ non-Hermitian topological phases and their associated anomalous boundary states characterized by distinctive complex-valued energy dispersions.

Title: Geometric potential for a Bose-Einstein condensate on a curved surface
Authors: Sheilla M. de Oliveira, Natália Salomé Móller
Abstract: We compute the ground state of a Bose-Einstein condensate confined on a curved surface and unravel the effects of curvatures. Starting with a general formulation for any smooth surface, we apply it to a prolate ellipsoid, which is inspired by recent bubble trap experiments. Using a perturbative approach to the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and a general Ansatz, followed by a dimensional reduction, we derive an effective two-dimensional equation that includes a curvature-dependent geometric potential. We compute the ground state using Thomas-Fermi approximation and, for an isotropic confinement, we find that the highest accumulation of atoms happens on the regions with the greatest difference between the principal curvatures. For a prolate ellipsoid, this accumulation happens on the equator, which is contrary to previous findings that describe accumulation on the poles of a bubble trap. Finally, we explain the reasons for this difference: the higher accumulation of atoms on the poles happens due to anisotropies in the confinement, while the higher accumulation on the equator happens exclusively due to the geometric properties of the surface.

Title: Flexible Perovskite/Silicon Monolithic Tandem Solar Cells Approaching 30% Efficiency

Abstract: Thanks to their excellent properties of low cost, lightweight, portability, and conformity, flexible perovskite-based tandem solar cells show great potentials for energy harvesting applications, with flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem solar cells particularly promising for achieving high efficiency. However, performance of flexible perovskite/c-silicon monolithic tandem solar cells still greatly lags, due to challenges in simultaneously achieving both efficient photocarrier transport and reliable mitigation of residual stress. Here, we reveal the critical role of perovskite phase homogeneity, for achieving high-efficient and mechanical-stable flexible perovskite/c-silicon heterojunction monolithic tandem solar cells (PSTs) with textured surface. Through ensuring high phase homogeneity, which promotes charge transfer across all facets of the pyramid on the textured substrates and releases the residual stress at the perovskite/c-silicon interface, we demonstrate flexible PSTs with a bending curvature of 0.44 cm-1, and a certified power conversion efficiency of 29.88% (1.04 cm2 aperture area), surpassing all other types of flexible perovskite-based photovoltaic devices. Our results can lead to broad applications and commercialization of flexible perovskite/c-silicon tandem photovoltaics.

Title: Self-assembly and time-dependent control of active and passive triblock Janus colloids
Authors: Juri Franz Schubert, Salman Fariz Navas, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: We perform Brownian Dynamics (BD) simulations to explore the self-assembly of a two-dimensional model system of triblock Janus colloids as an example of "patchy" colloids forming complex structures. Previous experiments and simulation studies have shown that such systems are capable of forming a two-dimensional Kagome lattice at room temperatures. However, it is well established that the crystallization is strongly hampered by the formation of long-living metastable aggregates. For this reason, recent studies have investigated activity, i.e., self-propulsion of the Janus particles as a mechanism to accelerate the formation of stable Kagome structures [Mallory and Cacciuto, JACS 141, 2500-2507 (2019)] at selected state points. Here we extend, first, the investigations of active Janus colloids for a broader range of densities and temperatures. We also characterize in detail the associated nucleation of Kagome clusters, as well as their structure in the steady state. Second, to make contact to the equilibrium case, we propose a simple activity time protocol where an initially chosen activity is switched off after a finite time. With this protocol, we not only find Kagome structures in a much broader range of densities than in the purely passive case, but also obtain a Kagome crystallization boundary very close to that proposed in earlier Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: The specific heat anomaly stems from a third-order phase transition in the 2D lattice sine-Gordon model
Authors: Loris Di Cairano, Alexandre Tkatchenko
Abstract: The specific heat anomaly (SHA) is broadly observed in statistical mechanics, appearing as a smooth, system-size-independent peak in the specific heat, in contrast to the singular behavior typical of second-order phase transitions (PTs). Its origin remains heavily debated: some attribute it to finite-size effects, others to unidentified phase transitions. Here we investigate SHA using the two-dimensional sine-Gordon (2D-sG) model and microcanonical inflection point analysis (MIPA), uncovering two key results. First, we show that the roughening transition in the 2D-sG model is a genuine third-order PT under MIPA, where the standard thermodynamic quantities remain continuous. This clarifies the ambiguity in the literature, where this transition was often, though inconclusively, attributed to a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. Through the use of MIPA and a comprehensive analysis of standard thermodynamic observables, we provide a coherent thermodynamic characterization that redefines the nature of this transition. Second, we find that the SHA is not itself a PT but rather the thermodynamic fingerprint of this third-order transition. These findings clarify the nature of SHA within the 2D-sG model and suggest that similar anomalies in other systems, such as the XY model, may likewise originate from third-order PTs, rather than mere crossovers. Our results provide a consistent thermodynamic interpretation of the SHA and highlight the broader relevance of third-order transitions in systems previously thought to exhibit only low-order or crossover transition.

Title: Upper critical field and pairing symmetry of Ising superconductors
Authors: Lena Engström, Ludovica Zullo, Tristan Cren, Andrej Mesaros, Pascal Simon
Abstract: Motivated by the fact that the measured critical field $H_c$ in various transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) superconductors is poorly understood, we reexamine its scaling behavior with temperature and spin-orbit coupling (SOC). By computing the spin-susceptibility in a multipocket system, we find that segments of the Fermi Surface (FS) at which the SOC has nodal points can have a contribution orders of magnitude larger than the remaining FS, hence setting the $H_c$, assuming the presence of a conventional singlet superconducting order parameter. Nodal lines of an Ising SOC in the Brillouin zone are imposed by symmetry, so they cause such nodal points whenever they intersect an FS pocket, which is indeed the case in monolayer NbSe$_2$ and TaS$_2$, but not in gated MoS$_2$ and WS$_2$. Our analysis reinterprets existing measurements, concluding that a dominant singlet-order parameter on pockets with SOC nodes is consistent with the $H_c(T)$ data for all monolayer Ising superconductors, in contrast to previous contradictory pairing assumptions. Finally, we show that the theory is also consistent with data on homobilayer TMDs.

Title: Critical clusters in liquid crystals: Fractal geometry and conformal invariance
Authors: Renan A. L. Almeida, Jeferson J. Arenzon
Abstract: We study the two-dimensional domain morphology of twisted nematic liquid crystals during their phase-ordering kinetics [R. A. L. Almeida, Phys. Rev. Lett. 131 (2023) 268101], which is a physical candidate to self-generate critical clusters in the percolation universality class. Here we present experimental evidence that large clusters and their hulls are indeed both fractals with dimensions of the corresponding figures in critical percolation models. The asymptotic decay of a crossing probability, from a region in the vicinity of the origin to the boundary of disks, is described by the Lawler-Schramm-Werner theorem provided that a microscopic length in the original formulation is replaced by the coarsening length of the liquid crystal. Furthermore, the behavior for the winding angle of large loops is, at certain scales, compatible with that of Schramm-Loewner evolution curves with diffusivity $\kappa = 6$. These results show an experimental realization of critical clusters in phase ordering.

Title: Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure
Authors: Lukas Hörmann, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.

Title: Materials Database from All-electron Hybrid Functional DFT Calculations
Authors: Akhil S. Nair, Lucas Foppa, Matthias Scheffler
Abstract: Materials databases built from calculations based on density functional approximations play an important role in the discovery of materials with improved properties. Most databases thus constructed rely on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) for electron exchange and correlation. This limits the reliability of these databases, as well as the artificial intelligence (AI) models trained on them, for certain classes of materials and properties which are not well described by GGA. In this paper, we describe a database of 7,024 inorganic materials presenting diverse structures and compositions generated using hybrid functional calculations enabled by their efficient implementation in the all-electron code FHI-aims. The database is used to evaluate the thermodynamic and electrochemical stability of oxides relevant to catalysis and energy related applications. We illustrate how the database can be used to train AI models for material properties using the sure-independence screening and sparsifying operator (SISSO) approach.

Title: Experimental Observation of Extremely Strong Defect-Phonon Scatterings in Semiconductor Single Crystals
Authors: Zifeng Huang, Jianbo Liang, Yuxiang Wang, Zixuan Sun, Naoteru Shigekawa, Ming Li, Runsheng Wang, Zhe Cheng
Abstract: The role of doping in tailoring thermal transport in semiconductors is critical for efficient thermal management in electronic devices. While the effects of doping have been extensively studied to tune electrical properties, its impact on thermal transport has not yet been thoroughly explored, particularly with respect to experimental investigations into exceptionally strong non-Rayleigh defect-phonon scattering phenomena. Herein, by combining the high-quality growth and advanced characterizations of cubic silicon carbide single crystals with well controlled boron doping, we experimentally observe anomalous strong defect-phonon scatterings, among the strongest reported in common semiconductors, that exceeds the predictions of the classic mass difference model by tens of times in magnitude. The measured thermal conductivity of doped 3C SiC match excellently with those predicted by first principle calculations in which resonant scattering of low frequency phonon is considered. Our findings not only shed light on the fundamental understanding of defect-phonon interactions and will also impact applications such as thermal management of electronics.

Title: Two-dimensional non-van der Waals niobium nitride nanosheets with high-temperature two-gap superconductivity
Authors: Si-Yi Xiong, Peng Jiang, Yiming Wang, Yan-Ling Li
Abstract: The exploration of the superconductivity in two-dimensional materials has garnered significant attention due to their promising low-power applications and fundamental scientific interest. Here, we report some novel stable non-van der Waals Nb$_x$N$_{x+1}$ ($x$ = 1-4) monolayers derived from the NbN bulk exfoliated along the (001) plane, as identified through first-principles calculations. Among these monolayers, Nb$_2$N$_3$, which crystallizes in the $P \overline{6} m2$ symmetry, stands out with an exceptional superconducting transition temperature of 77.8 K, setting a new high-$T_c$ benchmark for two-dimensional transition metal nitrides and binary compounds. Our detailed analysis reveals that the strong superconductivity in Nb$_2$N$_3$ is driven by phonon modes dominated by N vibrations, with significant electron-phonon coupling contributions from N-$p$ and Nb-$d$ electronic states. Using the anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg framework, we further determine the two-gap nature of the superconductivity in the Nb$_2$N$_3$ monolayer, characterized by pronounced electron-phonon coupling and anisotropic energy gaps. These results advance our understanding of superconductivity in 2D transition metal nitride and highlight their potential for nanoscale superconducting applications.

Title: Fluctuating magnetism in Zn-doped averievite with well-separated kagome layers

Abstract: Kagome lattice decorated with S=1/2 spins is one of the most discussed ways to realize a quantum spin liquid. However, all previous material realizations of this model have suffered from additional complications, ranging from additional interactions to impurity effects. Recently, a new quantum kagome system has been identified in the form of averievite Cu(5-x)ZnxV2O10(CsCl), featuring a unique double-layer spacing between the kagome planes. Using muon spin spectroscopy we show that only a complete substitution (i.e. $x=2$) of interplanar copper ions leads to a quantum-disordered ground state. In contrast, the parent compound ($x=0$) exhibits long-range magnetic order, with a phase transition around 24 K. Experiments performed on the partially substituted material ($x=1$) show that the transformation proceeds through an intermediate disordered, partially frozen ground state, unaffected by pressures up to 23 kbar. Our study provides a microscopic view of the magnetism of the decoupling of the kagome layers and establishes the averievite as a new material platform for the experimental study of the fully-decoupled kagome layers.

Title: Enhanced activity in layered-metal-oxide-based oxygen evolution catalysts by layer-by-layer modulation of metal ion identity
Authors: Ran Ding, Daniel Maldonado-Lopez, Jacob E. Henebry, Jose Mendoza-Cortes, Michael J. Zdilla
Abstract: Few-layered potassium nickel and cobalt oxides show drastic differences in catalytic activity based on metal ion preorganization. Uniform compositions $[(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6$ or $(\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ show limited activity, while homogenously-mixed-metal cobalt/nickel oxides $[(\mathrm{Co}_n\mathrm{Ni}_{1-n}\mathrm{O}_2/\mathrm{K})_6]$ display moderate improvement. However, a layer-by-layer arrangement of cobalt and nickel oxide sheets [e.g., $(\mathrm{CoO}_2/\mathrm{K}/\mathrm{NiO}_2/\mathrm{K})$] provides superior catalytic performance, reducing the oxygen evolution overpotential by more than 400 mV. Density functional theory simulations provide an illustration of the electronic properties (density of states and localization of orbitals) that promote catalysis in the layer-segregated materials over those of homogeneous composition. This study reveals that atomic preorganization of metal ions within layered catalysts plays a more crucial role than overall metal composition in enhancing catalytic efficiency for oxygen evolution.

Title: Thermodynamic interpretation to Stochastic Fisher Information and Single-Trajectory Speed Limits
Authors: Pedro B. Melo, Fernando Iemini, Diogo O. Soares-Pinto, Sílvio M. Duarte Queirós, Welles A. M. Morgado
Abstract: The Fisher information (FI) metric is a Riemannian metric that allows a geometric treatment of stochastic thermodynamics, introducing the possibility of computing thermodynamic lengths and deviations from equilibrium. At the trajectory level, a related quantity can be introduced, the stochastic Fisher information (SFI), which on average, is equivalent to the FI. In this work, we discuss two fundamental questions regarding the SFI; namely, (i) what is the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI is and (ii) whether there are any trajectory-level thermodynamic bounds due to the SFI. We find that, contrary to previous results in the literature for the FI, the thermodynamic interpretation of the SFI depends only on the entropy produced by the system and on the thermodynamic force. Moreover, we find that the SFI allows one to derive single-trajectory speed limits, which we demonstrate to hold for a Brownian particle under a saturating drive force and a Brownian particle under a decreasing drive force. From the ensemble of single-trajectory bounds one can derive a hierarchy of average speed limits that are always less tight than the one derived from the FI. We test our results for speed limits on the adopted models and find that the hierarchy of average speed limits is respected and that the single-trajectory speed limits behave qualitatively similarly to the average and stochastic speed limits, with some trajectories achieving velocities higher than the tightest average bound whenever it does not saturate. Our results open avenues for the exploration of uncertainty relations at the trajectory level.

Title: E. coli bacterium tumbling in bulk and close to surfaces: A simulation study
Authors: Pierre Martin, Tapan Chandra Adhyapak, Holger Stark
Abstract: Motility is fundamental to the survival and proliferation of microorganisms. The E. coli bacterium propels itself using a bundle of rotating helical flagella. If one flagellum reverses its rotational direction, it leaves the bundle, performs a polymorphic transformation, and the bacterium tumbles. The E. coli bacterium is hydrodynamically attracted to surfaces. This prolongs its residence time, while tumbling facilitates surface detachment. We develop a model of E. coli that uses an extended Kirchhoff rod theory to implement flagellar flexibility as well as different polymorphic conformations and perform hydrodynamic simulations with the method of multiparticle collision dynamics (MPCD). To establish a reference case, we determine the distribution of tumble angles in the bulk fluid, which shows good agreement with experiments for a fixed tumble time. Increasing the hook stiffness, narrows the tumble angle distribution and reduces the flagellar dispersion during tumbling. Close to a bounding surface, the tumble angle distribution is shifted to smaller angles, while flagellar dispersion is reduced. Reorientation within the plane favors the forward direction, which might be an explanation for prolonged run times observed in experiments

Title: Resonant inelastic X-ray scattering investigation of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling in $5d^2$ double perovskites
Authors: Felix Ivo Frontini, Christopher J. S. Heath, Bo Yuan, Corey M. Thompson, John Greedan, Adam J. Hauser, F. Y. Yang, Mark P. M. Dean, Mary H. Upton, Diego M. Casa, Young-June Kim
Abstract: $\mathrm{B}$ site ordered $5d^2$ double perovskites ($\mathrm{A_2BB'O_6,\ B'}=5d^2)$ display a remarkable range of physical properties upon variation of the chosen $\mathrm{B}$ and $\mathrm{B'}$ site ions. This sensitivity to chemical substitution reflects the delicate balance and profound impact of strong electronic correlation and spin-orbit coupling in such systems. We present rhenium $L_2$ and $L_3$ resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) measurements of two such physically dissimilar materials, Mott-insultating $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ and semiconducting $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$. Despite these differences, our RIXS results reveal similar energy scales of Hund's ($J_H$) and spin-orbit coupling ($\lambda$) in the two materials, with both systems firmly in the intermediate Hund's coupling regime ($\mathcal{O}(J_H/\lambda)\sim 1$). However, there are clear differences in their RIXS spectra. The conductive character of $\mathrm{Sr_2CrReO_6}$ broadens and obfuscates the atomic transitions within an electron-hole continuum, while the insulating character of $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ results in sharp atomic excitations. This contrast in their RIXS spectra despite their similar energy scales reflects a difference in the itinerancy-promoting hopping integral and illustrates the impact of the local crystal environment in double perovskites. Finally, $L_2$ and $L_3$ edge analyses of the atomic excitations in $\mathrm{Ba_2YReO_6}$ reveal that the energy scales of Hund's and spin-orbit coupling are in fact inverted compared to previously reported values. We present exact diagonalization calculations of the RIXS spectra at both edges which show good agreement with our results for new energy scales of $\lambda=0.290(5)$ eV and $J_H=0.38(2)$ eV ($J_H/\lambda=1.30(5)$).

Title: Chemotactic aggregation dynamics of micro-swimmers in Brinkman flows
Authors: Yasser Almoteri, Enkeleida Lushi
Abstract: We study through analysis and simulations of a continuum model the collective chemotactic dynamics of micro-swimmers immersed in viscous Brinkman flows. The Brinkman viscous flow approximates with a resistance or friction term the presence of inert impurities or stationary obstacles immersed in the fluid, an environment that can be regarded as a wet porous medium. Analysis of the linearized system reveals that resistance primarily affects the development of collective swimming instabilities and barely affects chemotactic instabilities. We present a parameter phase space for the distinct types of dynamics we can expect in the case of auto-chemotactic bacteria-like pusher swimmers for varying medium resistance, chemotactic response strength, and hydrodynamic coupling strength values. Simulations of the full nonlinear system show that resistance impacts the collective dynamics for each of these states because it inhibits the hydrodynamic interactions and the emergence of the collective swimmer. Surprisingly, and not expected from the linear analysis predictions, we find that resistance also hampers the chemotactic aggregation of the swimmers because it impedes their ability to navigate efficiently and collectively towards chemical cues and assemble into clusters. We show simulations of the complex system for parameters sets from each of the phase-space regions and quantify the observed behavior. Lastly, we discuss the experimental values of the parameters and discuss possible future experimental realizations of this system.

Title: Interfacial Behavior from the Atomic Blueprint: Machine Learning-Guided Design of Spatially Functionalized a-SiO2 Surfaces
Authors: Evgenii Strugovshchikov, Viktor Mandrolko, Dominika Lesnicki, Mariachiara Pastore, Laurent Chaput, Mykola Isaiev
Abstract: Precise control over surface chemistry is essential for tuning interfacial behavior in technologies ranging from catalysis and protective coatings to energy conversion systems. Although chemical functionalization of alpha-quartz (alpha-SiO2) with hydroxyl (OH) and methyl (CH3) groups has been extensively studied, the impact of their spatial distribution at the atomic scale remains largely uncharted. In this work, we integrate density functional theory (DFT), ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and on-the-fly machine-learned force fields (MLFFs) to systematically investigate how different arrangements of OH/CH3 groups modulate surface properties. Our results reveal that spatial patterning governs the formation of hydrogen-bonding networks, alters vibrational signatures, and has a significant influence on the thermodynamic stability of the functionalized surfaces. The MLFF framework enables high-fidelity simulations at unprecedented scales, bridging the gap between quantum accuracy and statistical sampling. By uncovering structure-property relationships inaccessible to conventional approaches, this study establishes spatial arrangement of functionalized groups as a critical and tunable design axis, paving the way for the predictive engineering of silica-based materials with optimized interfacial performance.

Title: A Quieter State of Charge -- Ultra-Low-Noise Collective Current in Charge-Density-Wave Nanowires
Authors: Subhajit Ghosh, Nicholas Sesing, Tina Salguero, Sergey Rumyantsev, Roger K. Lake, Alexander A. Balandin
Abstract: In quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) charge-density-wave (CDW) systems, electric current comprises normal electrons and a collective, electron-lattice condensate current associated with CDW sliding. While achieving the dissipation-less Frohlich current of the sliding condensate is impossible in real materials, one can imagine an important related target, namely reaching the electron transport regime where electronic noise is inhibited due to the collective, strongly-correlated nature of the electron-lattice condensate current. Here we report that in nanowires of the fully-gapped CDW material (TaSe4)2I, low-frequency electronic noise is suppressed below the limit of thermalized charge carriers in passive resistors. When the current is dominated by the sliding Frohlich condensate, the normalized noise spectral density decreases linearly with current -- a striking departure from the constant value observed in conventional conductors. This discovery signals intrinsically lower current fluctuations within a correlated transport regime. The dominant noise source due to fluctuations in the CDW depinning threshold is extrinsic and caused by lattice imperfections that locally pin the condensate. Once the bias voltage is well past threshold and the sliding mode is established, the normalized noise drops below the noise of normal electrons. No residual minimum noise level is observed for the current of the condensate. Since flicker noise limits phase stability in communication systems, reduces the sensitivity and selectivity of sensors, and degrades coherence in quantum devices, our discovery introduces a fundamentally new strategy for achieving ultra-low-noise performance in nanoscale and quantum electronics using strongly correlated materials.

Title: Soft-X-ray momentum microscopy of nonlinear magnon interactions below 100-nm wavelength
Authors: Steffen Wittrock, Christopher Klose, Salvatore Perna, Korbinian Baumgaertl, Andrea Mucchietto, Michael Schneider, Josefin Fuchs, Victor Deinhart, Tamer Karaman, Dirk Grundler, Stefan Eisebitt, Bastian Pfau, Daniel Schick
Abstract: Magnons represent quantised collective motions of long-range ordered spins. For wavelength below 100 nm, exchange interactions dominate their physics, which gives rise to a so far unexplored regime of nonlinearities and couplings between magnons and other quasiparticles. Besides their selective excitation, also the detection of such short-wavelength spin waves remains a challenge of current research and technology. Here, we probe the amplitude and wave vector of magnons by means of quasi-elastic resonant soft-X-ray scattering. This Magnon Momentum Microscopy (MMM) can access magnons directly in momentum space with remarkable sensitivity and high photon efficiency up to THz frequencies and down to few-nanometre wavelengths. The two-dimensional information obtained by this light-scattering-based technique is especially valuable for studying the nonlinear interactions of exchange-dominated magnons within technologically relevant thin-film samples. In doing so, we uncover a rich variety of deeply nonlinear magnon interactions, highlighting their potential for applications in novel computing schemes. With its intrinsic element-selectivity and ability to probe also buried layers, soft-X-ray MMM has the potential to establish itself as an advanced tool for ultrabroadband studies of short-wavelength magnonics.

Title: Optical Activity of Group III-V Quantum Dots Directly Embedded in Silicon
Authors: M. Gawełczyk, K. Gawarecki
Abstract: Optically active III-V group semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) are the leading element of the upcoming safe quantum communication. However, the entire electronic and IT infrastructure relies on silicon-based devices, with silicon also providing a natural platform for photonic integration. Combining semiconductor optics with silicon electronics is thus a major technological challenge. This obstacle cannot be directly solved because silicon is optically inactive. Interfacing III-V quantum dots with silicon is thus a sought-after solution. A radical approach is to embed III-V material grains directly into silicon. The first realization of such technology was developed, and it gave InAs and core-shell InAs/GaAs QDs embedded in Si with bright and narrow single-QD emission lines. No theory has been given, though, and, as we show here, it is not even obvious if and how such QDs can be optically active. We first use general arguments, also supported by atomistic calculations, that InAs/Si QDs cannot confine both carrier types unless the structural strain is mostly relaxed, meaning many defects at the interface. This explains the lack of light emission from those dots. Then we show that the InAs/GaAs/Si QDs can confine both carrier types. Their electron states are, however, highly influenced by $k$-space valley mixing, which impacts emission spectra and deteriorates optical properties. We propose to overcome this by adding an additional wider-bandgap material layer.

Title: Modification of the scattering mechanisms in bilayer graphene in proximity to a molecular thin film probed in the mesoscopic regime
Authors: Anise Mansour, Deanna Diaz, Movindu Kawshan Dissanayake, Erin Henkhaus, Jungyoun Cho, Vinh Tran, Francisco Ramirez, Eric Corona-Oceguera, Joshua Luna, Kenta Kodama, Yueyun Chen, Ho Chan, Jacob Weber, Blake Koford, Patrick Barfield, Maya Martinez, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, B. C. Regan, Matthew Mecklenburg, Thomas Gredig, Claudia Ojeda-Aristizabal
Abstract: Quantum coherent effects can be probed in multilayer graphene through electronic transport measurements at low temperatures. In particular, bilayer graphene is known to be susceptible to quantum interference corrections of the conductivity, presenting weak localization at all electronic densities, and dependent on different scattering mechanisms as well as on the trigonal warping of the electron dispersion near the K and K' valleys. Proximity effects with a molecular thin film influence these scattering mechanisms, which can be quantified through the known theory of magnetoconductance for bilayer graphene. Here, we present weak localization measurements in a copper-phthalocyanine / bilayer graphene / h-BN heterostructure that suggest an important suppression of trigonal warping effects in bilayer graphene (BLG), restoring the manifestation of the chirality of the charge carriers in the localization properties of BLG. Additionally, we observe a charge transfer of 3.6$\times$10$^{12}$cm$^{-2}$ from the BLG to the molecules, as well as a very small degradation of the mobility of the BLG/h-BN heterostructure upon the deposition of copper phthalocyanine (CuPc). The molecular arrangement of the CuPc thin film is characterized in a control sample through transmission electron microscopy, that we relate to the electronic transport results.

Title: Magnetically Enhanced Fenton-Like Processes by Nanofibers: Real-Time Observation of Tetracycline Degradation in Pig Manure Wastewater
Authors: Berta Centro Elía, Marco Antonio Morales, Vanina G. Franco, Jesús Antonio Fuentes García, Gerardo F. Goya
Abstract: This study presents a novel approach for the degradation of tetracycline (TC) in pig manure wastewater using magnet-ite-based magnetic nanofibers (MNFs) as heterogeneous Fenton-like catalysts. The MNFs, composed of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) embedded with MnFe_2O_4 nanoparticles, were synthesized via electrospinning and exhibited high stability and catalytic efficiency. The degradation process was driven by hydroxyl radical (OH) formation through hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) activation on the MNF surface. The results showed that TC was first adsorbed onto the MNFs before undergoing oxidation, with treatment efficiency increasing with H2O2 concentration up to an optimum point, due to increased OH scavenging by H_2O_2. A heterogeneous dynamic kinetic model (DKM) was developed to describe the degradation mechanism, incorporating reactive oxygen species (ROS) generation, catalyst surface inactivation, and polymer strip-ping effects. Furthermore, the application of an alternating magnetic field significantly accelerated the reaction rate, likely due to localized heating effects. This study highlights the potential of MNFs as a scalable, reusable and efficient alternative for antibiotic-contaminated wastewater treatment, offering advantages over conventional homogeneous Fenton processes by minimizing iron sludge formation and broadening the operational pH range.

Title: Supervised Pretraining for Material Property Prediction
Authors: Chowdhury Mohammad Abid Rahman, Aldo H. Romero, Prashnna K. Gyawali
Abstract: Accurate prediction of material properties facilitates the discovery of novel materials with tailored functionalities. Deep learning models have recently shown superior accuracy and flexibility in capturing structure-property relationships. However, these models often rely on supervised learning, which requires large, well-annotated datasets an expensive and time-consuming process. Self-supervised learning (SSL) offers a promising alternative by pretraining on large, unlabeled datasets to develop foundation models that can be fine-tuned for material property prediction. In this work, we propose supervised pretraining, where available class information serves as surrogate labels to guide learning, even when downstream tasks involve unrelated material properties. We evaluate this strategy on two state-of-the-art SSL models and introduce a novel framework for supervised pretraining. To further enhance representation learning, we propose a graph-based augmentation technique that injects noise to improve robustness without structurally deforming material graphs. The resulting foundation models are fine-tuned for six challenging material property predictions, achieving significant performance gains over baselines, ranging from 2% to 6.67% improvement in mean absolute error (MAE) and establishing a new benchmark in material property prediction. This study represents the first exploration of supervised pertaining with surrogate labels in material property prediction, advancing methodology and application in the field.

Title: Surmise for random matrices' level spacing distributions beyond nearest-neighbors
Authors: Ruth Shir, Pablo Martinez-Azcona, Aurélia Chenu
Abstract: Correlations between energy levels can help distinguish whether a many-body system is of integrable or chaotic nature. The study of short-range and long-range spectral correlations generally involves quantities which are very different, unless one uses the $k$-th nearest neighbor ($k$NN) level spacing distribution. For nearest-neighbor (NN) spectral spacings, the distribution in random matrices is well captured by the Wigner surmise. This well-known approximation, derived exactly for a 2$\times$2 matrix, is simple and satisfactorily describes the NN spacings of larger matrices. There have been attempts in the literature to generalize Wigner's surmise to further away neighbors. However, as we show, the current proposal in the literature does not accurately capture numerical data. Using the known variance of the distributions from random matrix theory, we propose a corrected surmise for the $k$NN spectral distributions. This surmise better characterizes spectral correlations while retaining the simplicity of Wigner's surmise. We test the predictions against numerical results and show that the corrected surmise is systematically better at capturing data from random matrices. Using the XXZ spin chain with random on-site disorder, we illustrate how these results can be used as a refined probe of many-body quantum chaos for both short- and long-range spectral correlations.

Title: $N$-ality symmetry and SPT phases in (1+1)d
Authors: Jun Maeda, Tsubasa Oishi
Abstract: Duality symmetries have been extensively investigated in various contexts, playing a crucial role in understanding quantum field theory and condensed matter theory. In this paper, we extend this framework by studying $N$-ality symmetries, which are a generalization of duality symmetries and are mathematically described by $\mathbb{Z}_N$-graded fusion categories. In particular, we focus on an $N$-ality symmetry obtained by gauging a non-anomalous subgroup of $\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N\times\mathbb{Z}_N$ symmetry with a type III anomaly. We determine the corresponding fusion rules via two complementary approaches: a direct calculation and a representation-theoretic method. As an application, we study the symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases associated with the $N$-ality symmetry. We classify all such SPT phases using the SymTFT framework and explicitly construct lattice Hamiltonians for some of them.

Title: Generalized Pulse Design in Floquet Engineering: Application to Interacting Spin Systems
Authors: Ryan Scott, Bryce Gadway, V. W. Scarola
Abstract: Floquet engineering in quantum simulation employs externally applied high frequency pulses to dynamically design steady state effective Hamiltonians. Such protocols can be used to enlarge the space of Hamiltonians but approximations often limit pulse profile shapes and therefore the space of available effective Hamiltonians. We consider a non-stroboscopic high frequency expansion formalism for Floquet engineering. We generalize the pulse profiles available by rigorously keeping all necessary terms to lowest order in inverse frequency expansions used to derive the effective Hamiltonians. Our approach allows wide tunability in application of external driving fields. We apply our method to long-range interacting XXZ spin Hamiltonians. We model an example application where we derive conditions on specific pulse shapes to engineer effective Ising models from XXZ models. Our method allows the space of continuous pulse profiles, relevant to experimental control fields, to better and more accurately explore possible effective Hamiltonians available for Floquet engineering.

Title: Emergence of Hermitian topology from non-Hermitian knots
Authors: Gaurav Hajong, Ranjan Modak, Bhabani Prasad Mandal
Abstract: The non-Hermiticity of the system gives rise to a distinct knot topology in the complex eigenvalue spectrum, which has no counterpart in Hermitian systems. In contrast, the singular values of a non-Hermitian (NH) Hamiltonian are always real by definition, meaning they can also be interpreted as the eigenvalues of some underlying Hermitian Hamiltonian. In this work, we demonstrate that if the singular values of a NH Hamiltonian are treated as eigenvalues of prototype translational-invariant Hermitian models that undergo a topological phase transition between two distinct phases, the complex eigenvalues of the NH Hamiltonian will also undergo a transition between different knot structures. We emphasize that the choice of a NH Hamiltonian whose singular values match the eigenvalues of a Hermitian model is not unique. However, our study suggests that this connection between the NH and Hermitian models remains robust as long as the periodicity in lattice momentum is same for both. Furthermore, we provide an example showing that a change in the topology of the Hermitian model implies a transition in the underlying NH knot topology, but a change in knot topology does not necessarily signal a topological transition in the Hermitian system.

Title: Nuclear responses with neural-network quantum states
Authors: Elad Parnes, Nir Barnea, Giuseppe Carleo, Alessandro Lovato, Noemi Rocco, Xilin Zhang
Abstract: We introduce a variational Monte Carlo framework that combines neural-network quantum states with the Lorentz integral transform technique to compute the dynamical properties of self-bound quantum many-body systems in continuous Hilbert spaces. While broadly applicable to various quantum systems, including atoms and molecules, in this initial application we focus on the photoabsorption cross section of light nuclei, where benchmarks against numerically exact techniques are available. Our accurate theoretical predictions are complemented by robust uncertainty quantification, enabling meaningful comparisons with experiments. We demonstrate that a simple nuclear Hamiltonian, based on a leading-order pionless effective field theory expansion and known to accurately reproduce the ground-state energies of nuclei with $A\leq 20$ nucleons also provides a reliable description of the photoabsorption cross section.

Title: Representation Learning on a Random Lattice
Authors: Aryeh Brill
Abstract: Decomposing a deep neural network's learned representations into interpretable features could greatly enhance its safety and reliability. To better understand features, we adopt a geometric perspective, viewing them as a learned coordinate system for mapping an embedded data distribution. We motivate a model of a generic data distribution as a random lattice and analyze its properties using percolation theory. Learned features are categorized into context, component, and surface features. The model is qualitatively consistent with recent findings in mechanistic interpretability and suggests directions for future research.

Title: Multi-loop and Multi-axis Atomtronic Sagnac Interferometry
Authors: Saurabh Pandey, Katarzyna Krzyzanowska, Malcolm Boshier
Abstract: We report the experimental realization of a large-area and multi-axis atomtronic interferometer in an optical waveguide for rotation sensing. A large enclosed area is achieved through multi-loop operation in a guided atom interferometer using Bose-Einstein condensates. We demonstrate a three-loop interferometer with a total interrogation time of ~ 0.4 s and an enclosed area of 8.7 mm$^2$- the largest reported in a fully guided or one-dimensional setup. High-contrast interference fringes are observed for up to five Sagnac orbits in a smaller loop-area configuration. Our approach enables interleaved rotation measurements about multiple arbitrary axes within the same experimental setup. We present results for area-enclosing interferometers in both horizontal and vertical planes, demonstrating that the interferometer contrast remains comparable across orthogonal orientations of the enclosed area vectors.

Abstract: We report a universal strengthening of the Robertson-Schr\''odinger uncertainty relation, revealing a previously overlooked trade-off of genuinely quantum origin, particularly as the state becomes more mixed. Remarkably, this generalized bound supplements the standard commutator term and the covariance term with an additional positive contribution that depends on the commutator of observables. The relation also rigorously proves and extends a conjectured uncertainty relation previously proposed in [Phys. Rev. A 110, 062215 (2024)]. For two-level quantum systems, the inequality becomes an exact equality for any state and any pair of observables, establishing that the bound is tight in the strongest possible sense.

Title: Research on Non-Contact Resistance
Authors: Tongxi Wang, Yiming Xu
Abstract: This paper investigated the phenomenon of non-contact resistance by inserting a non-magnetic metal rod into an induction coil to explore the response changes of an LRC circuit. We focused on analyzing the changes in inductance when non-ferromagnetic materials (such as H59 brass) were inserted into the coil and verified the impact of the copper rod on inductance through theoretical derivation and experimental validation. Based on Maxwell's equations, the magnetic field distribution within the copper rod was thoroughly derived, and the inductance and resistance values were experimentally measured. These results confirm the accuracy of the theoretical model.

Title: Initialization of Neutral and Charged Exciton Spin States in a Telecom-Emitting Quantum Dot
Authors: Giora Peniakov, Johannes Michl, Mohamed Helal, Raphael Joos, Michael Jetter, Simone L. Portalupi, Peter Michler, Sven Höfling, Tobias Huber-Loyola
Abstract: Photonic cluster states are highly entangled states that allow for photonic quantum computing and memory-less quantum repeaters. Their generation has been recently demonstrated using semiconductor quantum dots emitting at the 900 nm wavelength range. However, a similar demonstration at the communication-optimal telecom range has remained elusive. A key ingredient that is still missing is an appropriate optical excitation method. A central requirement of such a method is to allow an arbitrary spin initialization of quantum dot excitonic complexes. In this work, we report on developing such a method based on a quasi-resonant p-shell excitation for a telecom-C-band-emitting quantum dot. We show qubit writing of a neutral exciton and spin-preserving excitation of a negative trion. Using the Larmor precession of the negative trion under an externally applied magnetic field, we determine the in-plane g-factors of both the electron and the hole in the investigated quantum dot. In addition, we measure a lower bound on the hole coherence time, $T_{2}^{*}>6.4$ ns, boosting its candidacy as a sound photon entangler for more advanced quantum photonic schemes.

Title: The Anyonic Quantum Carnot Engine
Authors: H S Mani, N Ramadas, V V Sreedhar
Abstract: Combining two disparate lines of thought like thermodynamics and quantum mechanics yields surprising results. The resulting idea of quantum thermodynamic engines holds promise for harvesting novel sources of energy of purely quantum origin, like quantum statistics, to extract mechanical work from macroscopic quantum systems like Bose-Einstein condensates. It also allows one to explore thermodynamic thinking to `small' systems consisting only a few particles in quantum theory. In an earlier paper we had studied the quantum Otto engine using a small number of one-dimensional anyons as the medium to drive the thermodynamic engine. In this sequel, we study the gold-standard of thermodynamic engines, namely the Carnot engine, using two-dimensional anyons as the medium. An explicit expression is derived for the efficiency of the anyonic quantum Carnot engine.

Title: Trotterization is substantially efficient for low-energy states
Authors: Kaoru Mizuta, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: Trotterization is one of the central approaches for simulating quantum many-body dynamics on quantum computers or tensor networks. In addition to its simple implementation, recent studies have revealed that its error and cost can be reduced if the initial state is closed in the low-energy subspace. However, the improvement by the low-energy property rapidly vanishes as the Trotter order grows in the previous studies, and thus, it is mysterious whether there exists genuine advantage of low-energy initial states. In this Letter, we resolve this problem by proving the optimal error bound and cost of Trotterization for low-energy initial states. For generic local Hamiltonians composed of positive-semidefinite terms, we show that the Trotter error is at most linear in the initial state energy $\Delta$ and polylogarithmic in the system size $N$. As a result, the computational cost becomes substantially small for low-energy states with $\Delta \in o(Ng)$ compared to the one for arbitrary initial states, where $g$ denotes the energy per site and $Ng$ means the whole-system energy. Our error bound and cost of Trotterization achieve the theoretically-best scaling in the initial state energy $\Delta$. In addition, they can be partially extended to weakly-correlated initial states having low-energy expectation values, which are not necessarily closed in the low-energy subspace. Our results will pave the way for fast and accurate simulation of low-energy states, which are one central targets in condensed matter physics and quantum chemistry.

Title: A multireference picture of electronic excited states in vanadyl and copper tetraphenyl porphyrin molecular qubits
Authors: Arup Sarkar, Alessandro Lunghi
Abstract: The nature of electronic excited states has a deep impact on the dynamics of molecular spins, but remains poorly understood and characterized. Here we carry out a thorough multiconfigurational investigation for two prototypical molecular qubits based on vanadyl and copper tetra-phenyl porphyrins. State-average CASSCF and NEVPT2 calculations have been employed with four different active spaces of growing complexity to account for the d-d, second d-shell, ligand-to-metal charge transfer states and $\pi-\pi^*$ excited states, revealing an in-depth picture of low-lying excited states in agreement with experimental observations. The largest active spaces attempted, (13,14) for the vanadyl and (17,12) for the copper compounds, reveal that the lowest-lying excited states originate from $\pi-\pi^*$ quartet excitations. These findings shed light on the nature of the excited states of molecular qubits, taking an important step toward elucidating their role in molecular spin dynamics.

Title: Desynchronization in multilayer p-i-n drift step recovery diode
Authors: Jorge Pena Lozano, Kindred Griffis, Dimash Aimurzayev, Gregory Wierzba, Sergey V. Baryshev
Abstract: The impact semiconductor drift step recovery diodes (DSRDs) can have on high-power microwave applications make them a device of interest for future solid-state electronics. However, there is little known about their functionality and degradation under over-voltaging or high average power dissipation conditions that could therefore hinder their continual design and optimization toward better performance. The experiments on a Si seven layer DSRD conducted in the present paper allowed to broaden the understanding of its opening switching performance under over-voltaging conditions. A striking desynchronization was discovered and linked to junction and electro-neutral region damage through experiments and PSpice modelling.

Title: Simulating Heterogeneity within Elastic and Inelastic Discrete Mechanical Models
Authors: Jan Raisinger, Qiwei Zhang, John E. Bolander, Jan Eliáš
Abstract: The study investigates the elastic and fracture behaviors of discrete, elastically homogeneous models of heterogeneous media. The homogeneity is accomplished either by volumetric-deviatoric decomposition of constitutive function or by an auxiliary stress homogenization method. The elastic parameters of the homogenized material models are randomly varied in space to introduce heterogeneity independently of the geometric properties of the discrete model. Several forms of randomization are investigated using statistical properties of nodal stress oscillations in periodic representative volume elements (RVEs). It is found that the stress oscillations present in discrete models built on heterogeneous geometric structures with standard constitutive models cannot be replicated by randomization of the elastically homogeneous discrete system. The marginal distributions as well as dependencies between stress tensor components cannot be adequately matched. With respect to quasi-brittle fracture behavior, the macroscopic response of the different models is studied for the load case of uniaxial tension. The elastically homogenized material provides higher peak stress occurring at lower strain levels and a steeper softening phase, compared to the standard material. Randomization of the elastic material parameters, as well as adjustment of inelastic material parameters, brings the macroscopic response of the homogenized material close to that of the standard material, although the damage distribution prior to the strain localization differs. These findings provide insight into the potential for controlled, random assignment of heterogeneity in homogeneous models, using physically-based discretizations of material structure with standard constitutive models for comparison.

Title: High-temperature partition functions and classical simulability of long-range quantum systems
Authors: Jorge Sánchez-Segovia, Jan T. Schneider, Álvaro M. Alhambra
Abstract: Long-range quantum systems, in which the interactions decay as $1/r^{\alpha}$, are of increasing interest due to the variety of experimental set-ups in which they naturally appear. Motivated by this, we study fundamental properties of long-range spin systems in thermal equilibrium, focusing on the weak regime of $ \alpha>D$. Our main result is a proof of analiticity of their partition functions at high temperatures, which allows us to construct a classical algorithm with sub-exponential runtime $\exp(\mathcal{O}(\log^2(N/\epsilon)))$ that approximates the log-partition function to small additive error $\epsilon$. As by-products, we establish the equivalence of ensembles and the Gaussianity of the density of states, which we verify numerically in both the weak and strong long-range regimes. This also yields constraints on the appearance of various classes of phase transitions, including thermal, dynamical and excited-state ones. Our main technical contribution is the extension to the quantum long-range regime of the convergence criterion for cluster expansions of Kotecký and Preiss.

Title: Localized Fock Space Cages in Kinetically Constrained Models
Authors: Cheryne Jonay, Frank Pollmann
Abstract: We investigate a mechanism for non-ergodic behavior in many-body quantum systems arising from destructive interference, leading to localization in Fock space. Drawing parallels with single-particle flat-band localization and Aharonov-Bohm cages, we identify conditions under which similar interference effects in the many-body domain produce Fock space cages (FSCs)-highly localized many-body eigenstates. By interpreting Fock space as a graph where nodes represent bitstring basis states and edges denote non-zero transition amplitudes of the Hamiltonian, we analyze different kinetically constrained models. The FSCs cause non-ergodic dynamics when the system is initialized within their support, highlighting a universal interference-driven localization mechanism in many-body systems.

Title: Gradual charge order melting in Bi0.5Ca0.5MnO3 induced by ultrahigh magnetic field
Authors: Y. Ishii, A. Ikeda, M. Tokunaga, K. Kindo, A. Matsuo, Y. H. Matsuda
Abstract: We have investigated the magnetic properties of Bi0.5Ca0.5MnO3 under ultrahigh magnetic fields by magnetization measurements. This compound shows the metamagnetic transition which indicates the magnetic field induced charge order melting at the room temperature T = 293 K. We reveled that the temperature dependence of the critical field, where the highest critical field is higher than 100 T. At low temperatures, it has been found that the metamagnetic transitions become broad and vanish in the field ascending process below 70 K. On the other hand, in the field descending process, a clear metamagnetic transition is observed even below 70 K. This unusual behavior can be understood as the gradual charge order melting by magnetic field, and its simultaneous reformation. A coexistence of multiple order parameters can account for the observed characteristic dynamics of the first order phase transition. Finally, we constructed the B-T phase diagram with the unusual critical feature at ultrahigh magnetic fields.

Title: Protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a quantum-dot loop
Authors: Baksa Kolok, András Pályi
Abstract: A quantum system constrained to a degenerate energy eigenspace can undergo a nontrival time evolution upon adiabatic driving, described by a non-Abelian Berry phase. This type of dynamics may provide logical gates in quantum computing that are robust against timing errors. A strong candidate to realize such holonomic quantum gates is an electron or hole spin qubit trapped in a spin-orbit-coupled semiconductor, whose twofold Kramers degeneracy is protected by time-reversal symmetry. Here, we propose and quantitatively analyze protocols to measure the non-Abelian Berry phase by pumping a spin qubit through a loop of quantum dots. One of these protocols allows to characterize the local internal Zeeman field directions in the dots of the loop. We expect a near-term realisation of these protocols, as all key elements have been already demonstrated in spin-qubit experiments. These experiments would be important to assess the potential of holonomic quantum gates for spin-based quantum information processing.

Title: Resonant switching current detector based on underdamped Josephson junctions
Authors: Vladimir M. Krasnov
Abstract: Current-biased Josephson junctions can act as detectors of electromagnetic radiation. At optimal conditions, their sensitivity is limited by fluctuations causing stochastic switching from the superconducting to the resistive state. This work provides a quantitative description of a stochastic switching current detector, based on an underdamped Josephson junction. It is shown that activation of a Josephson plasma resonance can greatly enhance the detector responsivity in proportion to the quality factor of the junction. The ways of tuning the detector for achieving optimal operation are discussed. For realistic parameters of Nb/AlOx/Nb tunnel junctions, the sensitivity can reach $S\simeq 5\times10^{12}$ (V/W).

Title: Sensing Quantum Vacuum Fluctuations with Non-Gaussian Electronic Noise
Authors: Clovis Farley, Edouard Pinsolle, Bertrand Reulet
Abstract: The statistics of electron transport in a quantum conductor is affected by fluctuations of its voltage bias. Here we show experimentally how a third order correlation in the electromagnetic field arises from the noise of a tunnel junction in the microwave domain being modulated by the vacuum fluctuations generated by a resistor at ultralow temperature. This provides a way to measure the vacuum fluctuations experienced by the junction, not offset by the unavoidable noise added by the detection setup.

Title: The effects of V doping on the intrinsic properties of SmFe10Co2 alloys: a theoretical investigation
Authors: Diana Benea, Viorel Pop, Jan Minár
Abstract: The present study focuses on the intrinsic properties of the SmFe10Co2-xVx (x = 0-2) alloys, which includes the SmFe10Co2 alloy, one of the most promising permanent magnets with the ThMn12 type of structure due to its large saturation magnetization (1.78 T), high Curie temperature (Tc = 859 K), and anisotropy field (12 T) experimentally obtained. Unfortunately, its low coercivity (<0.4 T) hinders its use in permanent magnet applications. The effect of V-doping on magnetization, magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy, and Curie temperature is investigated by electronic band structure calculations. The spin-polarized fully relativistic Korringa-Kohn-Rostoker (SPR-KKR) band structure method, which employs the coherent potential approximation (CPA) to deal with substitutional disorder, has been used. The Hubbard-U correction to local spin density approximation (LSDA +U) was used to account for the large correlation effects due to the 4f electronic states of Sm. The computed magnetic moments and magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies were compared with existing experimental data to validate the theoretical approach's reliability. The exchange-coupling parameters from the Heisenberg model were used for obtaining the mean-field estimated Curie temperature. The magnetic anisotropy energy was separated into contributions from transition metals and Sm, and its relationships with the local environment, interatomic distances, and valence electron delocalization were analyzed. The suitability of the hypothetical SmFe10CoV alloy for permanent magnet manufacture was assessed using the calculated anisotropy field, magnetic hardness, and intrinsic magnetic properties.

Abstract: Bottom-up assembly of nanocrystals (NCs) into ordered arrays, or superlattices (SLs), is a promising route to design materials with new functionalities, but the degree of control over assembly into functional structures remains challenging. Using electrostatics, rather than density, to tune the interactions between semiconductor NCs, we watch self-assembly proceeding through a metastable liquid phase. We systematically investigate the phase behavior as a function of quench conditions in situ and in real time using small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS). Through quantitative fitting to colloid, liquid, and SL models, we extract the time evolution of each phase and the system phase diagram, which we find to be consistent with short-range attractive interactions. Using the phase diagram's predictive power, we establish control of the self-assembly rate over three orders of magnitude, and identify one- and two-step self-assembly regimes, with only the latter implicating the metastable liquid as an intermediate. Importantly, the presence of the metastable liquid increases SL formation rates relative to the equivalent one-step pathway, and SL order counterintuitively increases with the rate, revealing a highly desirable and generalizable kinetic strategy to promote and enhance ordered assembly.

Title: Spontaneous supercurrents and vortex depinning in two-dimensional arrays of $φ_0$-junctions
Authors: Simon Reinhardt, Alexander-Georg Penner, Johanna Berger, Christian Baumgartner, Sergei Gronin, Geoffrey C. Gardner, Tyler Lindemann, Michael J. Manfra, Leonid I. Glazman, Felix von Oppen, Nicola Paradiso, Christoph Strunk
Abstract: Two-dimensional arrays of ballistic Josephson junctions are important as model systems for synthetic quantum materials. Here, we investigate arrays of multiterminal junctions which exhibit a phase difference $\varphi_0$ at zero current. When applying an in-plane magnetic field we observe nonreciprocal vortex depinning currents. We explain this effect in terms of a ratchet-like pinning potential, which is induced by spontaneous supercurrent loops. Supercurrent loops arise in multiterminal $\varphi_0$-junction arrays as a consequence of next-nearest neighbor Josephson coupling. Tuning the density of vortices to commensurate values of the frustration parameter results in an enhancement of the ratchet effect. In addition, we find a surprising sign reversal of the ratchet effect near frustration 1/3. Our work calls for the search for novel magnetic structures in artificial crystals in the absence of time-reversal symmetry.

Title: Unveiling Mysteries of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$: 3D Magnetism in a layered like Magnet
Authors: Sagar Sarkar, Rohit Pathak, Arnob Mukherjee, Anna Delin, Olle Eriksson, Vladislav Borisov
Abstract: GdRu$_2$Si$_2$, a centrosymmetric magnet with a square lattice of Gd atoms, hosts a short-period skyrmion square lattice (SkL) without Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI). RKKY-type exchange between the Gd moments results in an exchange frustration, which is the main source of non-collinearity in the spiral phases of the system. Previous studies focused on the in-plane $\vec{Q}$ vectors in understanding the magnetic phases of the system as they appear and have been observed on the 2D Gd layers. In this work, we calculate the Gd-Gd magnetic exchange interactions ($J_{ij}$) and perform atomic spin dynamics (ASD) simulations, providing new insights about GdRu$_2$Si$_2$. Our calculated $J_{ij}$ shows that the strongest magnetic interaction occurs between Gd atoms along the [111] body-diagonal direction of the unit cell. This, along with the body-centered tetragonal structure of the Gd sublattice, points to the presence of a hitherto ignored modulation vector, $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$, along the [111] direction in the spiral phases of the system. ASD simulations confirm this interlayer modulation, demonstrating that GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s magnetic phases are more complex than suggested by 2D layer observations. The total magnetic order is determined by $\vec{Q}_{[111]}$ alongside intralayer $\vec{Q}_{[100]}$ and $\vec{Q}_{[010]}$, establishing GdRu$_2$Si$_2$ as a strong 3D magnet requiring comprehensive theoretical modeling. Considering these, our ASD simulations accurately reproduce experimental phase transitions and highlight the significant role of dipolar interactions (due to the large Gd moment) over a weak uniaxial anisotropy in determining the ground state. This work enhances the understanding of GdRu$_2$Si$_2$'s complex magnetism, suggesting similar interlayer effects may be important in other layered magnetic systems.

Title: Induced quantum magnetism on a triangular lattice of non-Kramers ions in PrMgAl11O19
Authors: S. Kumar, M. Klicpera, A. Eliáš, M. Kratochvílová, K. Załęski, M. Śliwińska-Bartkowiak, R. H. Colman, G. Bastien
Abstract: We report the magnetic properties of the quantum triangular lattice antiferromagnet (TLAF) PrMgAl11O19 through magnetization and specific heat measurements. Strong magnetic anisotropy indicates the realization of an Ising-like magnetism in PrMgAl11O19 single crystal while no long-range magnetic ordering is realized down to 0.4 K. The splitting of the low-lying quasi-doublet into two singlets suggested by experimental data, is consistent with an effective pseudospin-1/2 scenario. The observed gapless excitations in zero field are attributed to induced quantum magnetism, they would be induced by magnetic interactions of an energy scale comparable with the splitting between the two singlets. Based on these results, we modeled the magnetic ground state of PrMgAl11O19 by a quantum Ising magnet with an intrinsic transverse field rather than a quantum spin liquid (QSL). In addition, our data show a non-monotonous response of the low-temperature specific heat to the external fields revealing a complex interplay between intrinsic and external magnetic fields.

Title: Mind the memory: Consistent time reversal removes artefactual scaling of energy dissipation rate and provides more accurate and reliable thermodynamic inference
Authors: Tassilo Schwarz, Anatoly B. Kolomeisky, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: It has been proposed that an observed inverse power-law dependence of the Markovian estimate for the steady-state dissipation rate on the coarse-graining scale in self-similar networks reflects a scale-dependent energy dissipation. By explicit examples, it is demonstrated here that there are in general no relations between such an apparent power-law dependence and the actual dissipation on different length scales. We construct fractal networks with a single dissipative scale and networks with a true inverse energy-dissipation cascade, and show that they display the same scaling behavior. Moreover, we show that a self-similar network structure does not imply an inverse power-law scaling but may be mistaken for one in practice. When no dissipative cycles become hidden by the coarse graining, any scale dependence of the dissipation estimate vanishes if the memory is correctly accounted for in the time-reversal operation. A $k$-th order estimator is derived and necessary and sufficient conditions are proved for a guaranteed lower bound on dissipation. These higher-order estimators saturated in the order are proved to provide sharper lower bounds on dissipation and their scale dependence signifies hidden dissipative cycles. It is shown that estimators not saturated in the order may erroneously overestimate the microscopic dissipation. Our results underscore the still underappreciated importance of correctly accounting for memory in analyzing coarse observations.

Title: Systematic analysis of critical exponents in continuous dynamical phase transitions of weak noise theories
Authors: Timo Schorlepp, Ohad Shpielberg
Abstract: Dynamical phase transitions are nonequilibrium counterparts of thermodynamic phase transitions and share many similarities with their equilibrium analogs. In continuous phase transitions, critical exponents play a key role in characterizing the physics near criticality. This study aims to systematically analyze the set of possible critical exponents in weak noise statistical field theories in 1+1 dimensions, focusing on cases with a single fluctuating field. To achieve this, we develop and apply the Gaussian fluctuation method, avoiding reliance on constructing a Landau theory based on system symmetries. Our analysis reveals that the critical exponents can be categorized into a limited set of distinct cases, suggesting a constrained universality in weak noise-induced dynamical phase transitions. We illustrate our findings in two examples: short-time large deviations of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang equation, and the weakly asymmetric exclusion process on a ring within the framework of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.

Title: Competing charge density wave phases in YNiC2
Authors: Marta Roman, Simone Di Cataldo, Berthold Stöger, Lisa Reisinger, Emilie Morineau, Kamil K. Kolincio, Herwig Michor
Abstract: Charge density wave (CDW) orders in YNiC2 are studied by means of combined experimental and computational techniques. On the experimental side, single crystals grown by the floating-zone method were examined by means of X-ray diffraction, as well as transport and thermal techniques. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations founded on the experimentally determined parent and CDW-modified crystal structures provide details of electronic and phononic structures as well as electron-phonon coupling and resolve changes inflicted upon entering the different CDW phases. Thereby, contrasting effects of subsequently emerging CDW states characterized by incommensurate q_{1ic} and commensurate q_{2c} modulation vectors are revealed. The former state, on-setting below T_{1ic}~ 305 K, weakly modifies the electronic structure by opening an almost isotropic gap on a minor part of the Fermi surface (FS). The latter phase, which takes over below T_{2c}~ 272 K has a more pronounced impact on physical properties via a decomposition of larger parts of the FS. These dissimilar behaviors are directly reflected in the electronic transport anisotropy, which is significantly weakened in the q_{2c}-type CDW state. As revealed by our DFT studies, CDW phases are very close in energy and their origin is directly related to the anisotropy of electron-phonon coupling, which is linked to a specific orbital character of related FS sheets. Specific heat and thermal expansion studies reveal a nearly reversible first-order phase transition at around T_{2c}~ 272 K, where both CDW phases co-exist within a T-interval of about 10 K.

Title: Magnetically-controlled Vortex Dynamics in a Ferromagnetic Superconductor

Abstract: Ferromagnetic superconductors are exceptionally rare because the strong ferromagnetic exchange field usually destroys singlet superconductivity. EuFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, an iron-based superconductor with a maximum critical temperature of 25 K, uniquely exhibits full coexistence with ferromagnetic order below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ $\simeq$ $19$ K. The interplay leads to narrowing of ferromagnetic domains at higher temperatures and spontaneous nucleation of vortices/antivortices at lower temperatures. Here we demonstrate how the underlying magnetic structure controls the superconducting vortex dynamics in applied magnetic fields. Just below $T_\mathrm{FM}$ we observe a pronounced peak in the creep activation energy, and magnetic force microscopy measurements reveal the presence of very closely-spaced ($w\ll \lambda$) vortex clusters. We attribute these observations to the formation of vortex polarons for which we present a theoretical description. In contrast, we link strong magnetic irreversibility at low temperatures to a critical current governed by giant flux creep over an activation barrier for vortex-antivortex annihilation near domain walls. Our work suggests new routes for the magnetic enhancement of vortex pinning with important applications in high-current conductors.

Title: Spin-Transfer Torque in Altermagnets with Magnetic Textures
Authors: Hamed Vakili, Edward Schwartz, Alexey A. Kovalev
Abstract: We predict the existence of anisotropic spin-transfer torque effect in textured altermagnets. To this end, we generalize the Zhang-Li torque to incorporate the symmetry associated with prototypical $d$-wave altermagnets and identify the spin-splitter adiabatic and nonadiabatic torques. Applying our results to domain wall dynamics induced by spin-transfer torque, we find that, in certain regimes, the spin-splitter adiabatic torque can induce domain wall precession, significantly slowing down domain wall motion. The response of the domain wall also becomes anisotropic, reflecting the $d$-wave symmetry of the altermagnet. Furthermore, we observe that the spin-splitter adiabatic torque modifies skyrmion dynamics, inducing anisotropic skyrmion Hall effect. The above phenomena can serve as a hallmark of altermagnetism in textured magnets, distinguishing it from the behavior of ordinary antiferromagnets.

Title: Persistent current in a non-Hermitian Hatano-Nelson ring: Disorder-induced amplification
Authors: Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: Non-reciprocal hopping induces a synthetic magnetic flux which leads to the non-Hermitian Aharonov-Bohm effect. Since non-Hermitian Hamiltonians possess both real and imaginary eigenvalues, this effect allows the observation of real and imaginary persistent currents in a ring threaded by the synthetic flux. Motivated by this, we investigate the behavior of persistent currents in a disordered Hatano-Nelson ring with anti-Hermitian intradimer hopping. The disorder is diagonal and we explore three distinct models, namely the Aubry-André-Harper model, the Fibonacci model, both representing correlated disorder, and an uncorrelated (random) model. We conduct a detailed analysis of the energy spectrum and examine the real and imaginary parts of the persistent current under various conditions such as different ring sizes and filling factors. Interestingly, we find that real and imaginary persistent currents exhibit amplification in the presence of correlated disorder. This amplification is also observed in certain individual random configurations but vanishes after configuration averaging. Additionally, we observe both diamagnetic and paramagnetic responses in the current behavior and investigate aspects of persistent currents in the absence of disorder that have not been previously explored. Interestingly, we find that the intradimer bonds host only imaginary currents, while the interdimer bonds carry only real currents. The bulk-boundary correspondence is investigated by analyzing the existence of localized edge states under the open boundary condition.

Title: The electronic structure and disorder effect of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ superconductor
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Yi Zhang, Kun Jiang
Abstract: Determining the electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ is an essential step towards uncovering their superconducting mechanism. It is widely believed that the bilayer apical oxygens play an important role in the bilayer La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ electronic structure. Applying the hybrid exchange-correlation functionals, we obtain a more accurate electronic structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ at its high-pressure phase, where the binding $d_{z^2}$ band is below the Fermi level owing to apical oxygen. The symmetry properties of this electronic structure and its corresponding tight-binding model are further analyzed. We find the antisymmetric part is highly entangled leading to a minimal nearly degenerate two-orbital model. Then, the apical oxygen vacancies effect is studied using the dynamical cluster approximation. This disorder effect strongly destroys the antisymmetric $\beta$ Fermi surface leading to the possible disappearance of superconductivity.

Title: Phase behavior of Cacio e Pepe sauce
Authors: Giacomo Bartolucci, Daniel Maria Busiello, Matteo Ciarchi, Alberto Corticelli, Ivan Di Terlizzi, Fabrizio Olmeda, Davide Revignas, Vincenzo Maria Schimmenti
Abstract: ``Pasta alla Cacio e pepe'' is a traditional Italian dish made with pasta, pecorino cheese, and pepper. Despite its simple ingredient list, achieving the perfect texture and creaminess of the sauce can be challenging. In this study, we systematically explore the phase behavior of Cacio e pepe sauce, focusing on its stability at increasing temperatures for various proportions of cheese, water, and starch. We identify starch concentration as the key factor influencing sauce stability, with direct implications for practical cooking. Specifically, we delineate a regime where starch concentrations below 1\% (relative to cheese mass) lead to the formation of system-wide clumps, a condition determining what we term the ``Mozzarella Phase'' and corresponding to an unpleasant and separated sauce. Additionally, we examine the impact of cheese concentration relative to water at a fixed starch level, observing a lower critical solution temperature that we theoretically rationalized by means of a minimal effective free-energy model. \tcr{We further analyze the effect of a less traditional stabilizer, trisodium citrate, and observe a sharp transition from the Mozzarella Phase to a completely smooth and stable sauce, in contrast to starch-stabilized mixtures, where the transition is more gradual.} Finally, we present a scientifically optimized recipe based on our findings, enabling a consistently flawless execution of this classic dish.

Title: Dirac-Schwinger Quantization for Emergent Magnetic Monopoles?
Authors: A. Farhan (1), M. Saccone (2), B.F.L. Ward (1) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Baylor University, Waco, TX, USA, (2) Croputation, Santa Fe, NM, USA)
Abstract: In Refs.[1-4] Dirac and Schwinger showed the existence of a magnetic monopole required a charge quantization condition which we write following Dirac as $\frac{eg}{4\pi\hbar}=\frac{n}{2},\; n=0,\pm 1,\; \pm 2, \ldots$. Here, $g$ is the magnetic monopole charge and $e$ is the electric charge of the positron. Recently, in Refs. [5,6], it has been shown experimentally that frustrated spin-ice systems exhibit 'emergent' magnetic monopoles. We show that, within the experimental errors, the respective magnetic charges obey the Dirac-Schwinger quantization condition. Possible implications are discussed.

Title: Self-sustained Josephson dynamics and self-trapping in supersolids
Authors: Aitor Alaña, Michele Modugno, Pablo Capuzzi, D. M. Jezek
Abstract: We explore the self-sustained Josephson junction dynamics in dipolar supersolids, predicting the possibility of self-trapping alongside the experimentally observed Josephson oscillations [Biagioni, G. et al., Nature 629, 773 (2024)]. Using an asymmetric two-mode (ATM) model to describe a triangular dipolar supersolid, validated through Gross-Pitaevskii simulations, we demonstrate that the system's symmetry enables a consistent two-mode mapping despite the presence of seven droplets. Hence, the associated Hamiltonian allows us to straightforwardly determine the self-trapping regime. Additionally, we show that bringing the system into rotation preserves its ability to sustain the Josephson junction dynamics across its full range, and we assess the robustness of the ATM model under these conditions. We further find that the off-axis droplets move in the radial direction during the evolution in accordance with the size of the central droplet. Such movements do not interfere with the model predictions.

Title: Momentum-dependent electron-phonon coupling in cuprates by RIXS: the roles of phonon symmetry and electronic structure

Radaelli, Giacomo Ghiringhelli
Abstract: The experimental determination of the magnitude and momentum dependence of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) is an outstanding problem in condensed matter physics. Resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) has been previously employed to determine the EPC, since the intensity of phonon peaks in RIXS spectra has been directly related to the underlying EPC strength. In order to assess the limits of validity of such a relation, we compare experimental results and theoretical predictions for several high-T$_c$ superconducting cuprates. Namely, we investigate the intensity of the bond-stretching phonon mode in CaCuO$_2$, La$_2$CuO$_{4+\delta}$, La$_{1.84}$Sr$_{0.16}$CuO$_4$ and YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{7-\delta}$ along the high symmetry ($\zeta$,0), ($\zeta$,$\zeta$) directions and as a function of the azimuthal angle $\phi$ at fixed modulus of the in-plane momentum $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$. Using two different theoretical approaches for the description of the RIXS scattering from phonons, we find that the $\mathbf{q_\parallel}$-dependence of the RIXS intensity can be largely ascribed to the symmetry of the phonon mode, and that satisfactory prediction of the experimental results cannot be obtained without including realistic details of the electronic structure in the calculations. Regardless of the theoretical model, RIXS provides a reliable momentum dependence of EPC in cuprates and can be used to test advanced theoretical predictions.

Title: Effect of disorder and strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits
Authors: Abhikbrata Sarkar, Pratik Chowdhury, Xuedong Hu, Andre Saraiva, A. S. Dzurak, A. R. Hamilton, Rajib Rahman, Dimitrie Culcer
Abstract: Germanium quantum dots in strained $\text{Ge}/\text{Si}_{1-x}\text{Ge}_{x}$ heterostructures exhibit fast and coherent hole qubit control in experiments. In this work, we theoretically and numerically address the effects of random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain on the operation of planar Ge hole spin qubits. Electrical operation of hole quantum dot spin qubits is enabled by the strong Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) originating from the intrinsic SOC in the Ge valence band as well as from the structural inversion asymmetry inherent in the underlying 2D hole gas. We use the atomistic valence force field (VFF) method to compute the strain due to random alloy disorder, and thermal expansion models in COMSOL Multiphysics to obtain the strain from a realistic gate-stack of planar hole quantum dot confinement. Recently, spin-orbit coupling terms $\propto k$ have been shown to be induced by strain inhomogeneity. Our hybrid approach to realistic device modeling suggests that strain inhomogeneity due to both random alloy disorder and gate-induced strain make a strong contribution to the linear-$k$ Dresselhaus spin-orbit coupling, which eventually dominates hole spin EDSR; and there exist specific in-plane orientations of the global magnetic field $\mathbf{B}$ and the microwave drive $\mathbf{\tilde{E}}_{\text{ac}}$ for maximum EDSR Rabi frequency of the hole spin qubit. The current model including strain inhomogeneity accurately predicts the EDSR Rabi frequency to be $\!\sim\!100$ MHz for typical electric and magnetic fields in experiments, which represents at least an order of magnitude improvement in accuracy over phenomenological models assuming uniform uniaxial strain. State-of-the-art atomistic tight binding calculations via nano-electronic modeling (NEMO3D) are in agreement with the $\mathbf{k}{\cdot}\mathbf{p}$ description.

Title: When Adiabaticity Is Not Enough to Study Topological Phases in Solid-State Physics: Comparing the Berry and Aharonov-Anandan Phases in 2D Materials
Authors: Abdiel de Jesús Espinosa-Champo, Alejandro Kunold, Gerardo G. Naumis
Abstract: Topological phases emerge as the parameters of a quantum system vary with time. Under the adiabatic approximation, the time dependence can be eliminated, allowing the Berry topological phase to be obtained from a closed trajectory in parameter space. In solid-state physics, this approach is commonly applied by taking a reciprocal space wavevector as the parameter, which is assumed to be varied by electromagnetic this http URL Berry curvature is then obtained by computing the derivatives of Bloch wavefunctions in reciprocal space. However, in many systems-especially gapless ones-the adiabatic approximation is never satisfied. This is particularly true in Dirac and Weyl materials, where the Berry curvature is often calculated without considering the breakdown of the adiabatic condition. In this work, we demonstrate how other time-dependent topological quantities, specifically the Aharonov-Anandan phase, can be used to extract information not only about topology but also about band transitions in 2D materials. In particular, a relationship between the current and the Aharonov-Anandan phase is proved, showing that photon-induced transitions produce current vortices. To illustrate this, we analyze graphene under electromagnetic radiation from a time-driven perspective, showing how the Aharonov-Anandan and Berry phases provide complementary insights into topology, interband transitions, and currents. This is achieved by using the Dirac-Bloch formalism and by solving the time-dependent equations within Floquet theory.

Title: Emergence of Fermi's Golden Rule in the Probing of a Quantum Many-Body System
Authors: Jianyi Chen, Songtao Huang, Yunpeng Ji, Grant L. Schumacher, Alan Tsidilkovski, Alexander Schuckert, Gabriel G. T. Assumpção, Nir Navon
Abstract: Fermi's Golden Rule (FGR) is one of the most impactful formulas in quantum mechanics, providing a link between easy-to-measure observables - such as transition rates - and fundamental microscopic properties - such as density of states or spectral functions. Its validity relies on three key assumptions: the existence of a continuum, an appropriate time window, and a weak coupling. Understanding the regime of validity of FGR is critical for the proper interpretation of most spectroscopic experiments. While the assumptions underlying FGR are straightforward to analyze in simple models, their applicability is significantly more complex in quantum many-body systems. Here, we observe the emergence and breakdown of FGR, using a strongly interacting homogeneous spin-$1/2$ Fermi gas coupled to a radio-frequency (rf) field. Measuring the transition probability into an outcoupled internal state, we map the system's dynamical response diagram versus the rf-pulse duration $t$ and Rabi frequency $\Omega_0$. For weak drives, we identify three regimes: an early-time regime where the transition probability takes off as $t^2$, an intermediate-time FGR regime, and a long-time non-perturbative regime. Beyond a threshold Rabi frequency, Rabi oscillations appear. Our results provide a blueprint for the applicability of linear response theory to the spectroscopy of quantum many-body systems.

Title: The reliability of hybrid functionals for accurate fundamental and optical gap prediction of bulk solids and surfaces
Authors: Francisca Sagredo, María Camarasa-Gómez, Francesco Ricci, Aurélie Champagne, Leeor Kronik, Jeffrey B. Neaton
Abstract: Hybrid functionals have been considered insufficiently reliable for the prediction of band gaps in solids and surfaces. We revisit this issue with a new generation of optimally-tuned range-separated hybrid functionals, focusing on the reconstructed Si(111)-(2x1) and Ge(111)-(2x1) surfaces. We show that certain hybrid functionals can accurately predict the surface-state and bulk fundamental and optical gaps, as well as projected band structures of these surfaces, by combining ground-state and time-dependent density functional theory.

Title: Anomalous current-electric field characteristics in transport through a nanoelectromechanical systems
Authors: Chengjie Wu, Yi Ding. Yiying Yan, Yuguo Su, Elijah Omollo Ayieta, Slobodan Radošević, Georg Engelhardt, Gernot Schaller, JunYan Luo
Abstract: A deep understanding of the correlation between electronic and mechanical degrees of freedom is crucial to the development of quantum devices in a nanoelectromechanical system (NEMS). In this work, we first establish a fully quantum mechanical approach for transport through a NEMS device, which is valid for arbitrary bias voltages, temperatures, and electro-mechanical couplings. We find an anomalous current-electric field characteristics at a low bias, where the current decreases with a rising electric field, associated with the backward tunneling of electrons for a weak mechanical damping. We reveal that this intriguing behavior arises from a combined effect of mechanical motion and Coulomb blockade, where the rapid increase of backward tunneling events at a large oscillation amplitude suppresses the forward current due to prohibition of double occupation. In the opposite limit of strong damping, the oscillator dissipates its energy to the environment and relaxes to the ground state rapidly. Electrons then transport via the lowest vibrational state such that the net current and its corresponding noise have a vanishing dependence on the electric field.

Title: Transient Chirality in the Gelation of Adhesive Spinner Monolayers
Authors: Yujie Jiang, Haiquan Li, Yiting Liu, Haoran Li, Yang Cui
Abstract: Active systems of self-rotating elements inherently exhibit chirality, making them of fundamental interest due to parity violation. Using large-scale hydrodynamic simulations, we investigate the gelation of adhesive spinners confined to quasi-2D monolayers at low Reynolds numbers. Unlike the coarsening dynamics of passive colloids, spinner gelation follows a different pathway, displaying structural chirality during the early stages of aggregation. However, this chirality dissipates upon dynamical arrest, resulting in a final gel structure that resembles a conventional colloidal gel. As a result, we find no sign of odd mechanical responses. Nonetheless, the elastic modulus and gelation time remain tunable through spinning activity, providing a new avenue for the bottom-up design of programmable soft materials.

Title: 3D variational autoencoder for fingerprinting microstructure volume elements
Authors: Michael D. White, Michael D. Atkinson, Adam J. Plowman, Pratheek Shanthraj
Abstract: Microstructure quantification is an important step towards establishing structure-property relationships in materials. Machine learning-based image processing methods have been shown to outperform conventional image processing techniques and are increasingly applied to microstructure quantification tasks. In this work, we present a 3D variational autoencoder (VAE) for encoding microstructure volume elements (VEs) comprising voxelated crystallographic orientation data. Crystal symmetries in the orientation space are accounted for by mapping to the crystallographic fundamental zone as a preprocessing step, which allows for a continuous loss function to be used and improves the training convergence rate. The VAE is then used to encode a training set of VEs with an equiaxed polycrystalline microstructure with random texture. Accurate reconstructions are achieved with a relative average misorientation error of 9x10-3 on the test dataset, for a continuous latent space with dimension 256. We show that the model generalises well to microstructures with textures, grain sizes and aspect ratios outside the training distribution. Structure-property relationships are explored through using the training set of VEs as initial configurations in various crystal plasticity (CP) simulations. Microstructural fingerprints extracted from the VAE, which parameterise the VEs in a low-dimensional latent space, are stored alongside the volume-averaged stress response, at each strain increment, to uniaxial tensile deformation from CP simulations. This is then used to train a fully connected neural network mapping the input fingerprint to the resulting stress response, which acts as a surrogate model for the CP simulation. The fingerprint-based surrogate model is shown to accurately predict the microstructural dependence in the CP stress response, with a relative mean-squared error of 8.9x10-4 on unseen test data.

Title: A collision model for very flexible Cosserat rods and immersed-boundary fluid-structure coupling

Abstract: The paper presents a constraint-based collision model for Cosserat rods, able to handle dynamic or static contact between a large number of highly flexible structures. The model provides the required collision impulses prior to updating the solution of the rods, with the impulses accounted for as external loads. The procedure avoids the need to modify the structure solver itself and circumvents any iteration between the collision model and the solver for the Cosserat rods, maintaining the efficiency of any chosen Cosserat solver. The collision model is adopted from Tschisgale et al. (Arch. Appl. Mech., 2019) and extended towards higher stability, which is found necessary in the case of very flexible rods. Furthermore, the model is supplemented with additional terms that arise when the colliding rods are immersed in a fluid. The latter is accounted for by an immersed-boundary method. A large number of tests are conducted to demonstrate the functionality of the final model.

Title: Predicting Methane Adsorption in Metal-Substituted MOFs: A Comparative Study between Density Functional Theory and Machine Learning
Authors: Karim Aljamal, Xiao Wang
Abstract: Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are promising materials for methane capture due to their high surface area and tunable properties. Metal substitution represents a powerful strategy to enhance MOF performance, yet systematic exploration of the vast chemical space remains challenging. In this work, we compare density functional theory (DFT) and machine learning (ML) in predicting methane adsorption properties in metal-substituted variants of three high-performing MOFs: M-HKUST-1, M-ATC, and M-ZIF-8 (M = Cu, Zn). DFT calculations reveal significant differences in methane binding energies between Cu and Zn variants of all three MOFs. On the other hand, we fine-tuned a pretrained multimodal ML model, PMTransformer, on a curated subset of hypothetical MOF (hMOF) structures to predict macroscopic adsorption properties. While the fine-tuned heat of adsorption model and uptake model qualitatively predict adsorption properties for original unaltered MOFs, they fail to distinguish between metal variants despite their different binding energetics identified by DFT. We trace this limitation to the hMOF training data generated using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo (GCMC) simulations based on classical force fields (UFF/TraPPE). Our study highlights a key challenge in ML-based MOF screening: ML models inherit the limitations of their training data, particularly when electronic effects at open metal sites significantly impact adsorption behaviors. Our findings emphasize the need for improved force fields or hybrid GCMC/DFT datasets to incorporate both geometric and electronic factors for accurate prediction of adsorption properties in metal-substituted MOFs.

Title: Topological phases of coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires
Authors: Anas Abdelwahab
Abstract: The phase diagrams of arbitrary number $N_{\text{w}}$ of diagonally and perpendicularly coupled Su-Schrieffer-Heeger wires have been identified. The diagonally coupled wires have rich topological phase diagrams exhibiting insulating phases with winding numbers $0\leq w \leq N_{\text{w}}$ and topological critical lines restricted by the reflection mirror symmetry. Even number of perpendicularly coupled wires exhibit either gapless or trivial topological phases. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires additionally exhibit nontrivial topological phases with winding number $w=1$. Due to the mirror reflection symmetry, their gapless regions can be topologically nontrivial. Odd number of perpendicularly coupled wires reveal coherent confined correlations in the odd indexed wires with strong wire-wire coupling away from the gapless regions.

Title: Signatures of Hund$'s$ metal physics in single-layered 3d transition metal oxide, $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$
Authors: Shivani Bhardwaj, Sudhir K Pandey
Abstract: With density functional theory plus dynamical mean-field theory, we study the influence of Hund's coupling on the nature of electronic correlations in $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$. Our results suggest strong signatures of Hund's metal physics in this compound. The Co 3$d$ states show large orbital differentiation in the degree of correlations and mass enhancement. The imaginary-time correlation functions suggest the presence of spin-orbital separation and large local charge fluctuations in the system. Breakdown of the Fermi-liquid picture is observed at the lowest calculated temperature for various strengths of Hund's coupling, suggesting the Fermi-liquid coherence scale lower than $\sim$100 K. Interestingly, a sudden emergence of a gapped state is noted for $e_g$ orbitals in its spectral density of states at $\sim$200 K in the vicinity of Fermi-level. Among the Co 3$d$ states 3$d_{z^2}$ and 3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ foster enlarged correlations. This study conclusively identifies $\mathrm{Sr_2CoO_4}$ as the first single-layered 3$d$ transition metal oxide to be classified as Hund's metal.

Title: Immersed figure-8 annuli and anyons
Authors: Bowen Shi
Abstract: Immersion (i.e., local embedding) is relevant to the physics of topologically ordered phases through the entanglement bootstrap. An annulus can be immersed in a disk or a sphere as a "figure-8", which cannot be smoothly deformed to an embedded annulus. We investigate a simple problem: is there an Abelian state on the immersed figure-8 annulus, locally indistinguishable from the ground state of the background physical system? We show that if the answer is affirmative, a strong sense of isomorphism must hold: two homeomorphic immersed regions must have isomorphic information convex sets, even if they cannot smoothly deform to each other on the background physical system. We explain why to care about strong isomorphism in physical systems with anyons and give proof in the context of Abelian anyon theory. We further discuss a connection between immersed annuli and anyon transportation in the presence of topological defects. In the appendices, we discuss related problems in broader contexts.

Title: The Overlap Gap Property limits limit swapping in QAOA
Authors: Mark Xin Hong Goh
Abstract: The Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) is a quantum algorithm designed for Combinatorial Optimization Problem (COP). We show that if a local algorithm is limited in performance at logarithmic depth for a spin glass type COP with an underlying Erdös--Rényi hypergraph, then a random regular hypergraph exhibits it as well. As such, we re-derived the fact that the average-case value obtained by QAOA for the Max-$q$-XORSAT for even $q\ge 4$ is bounded away from optimality even when the algorithm runs indefinitely if optimised using the so-called tree parameters due to the presence of the Overlap Gap Property (OGP). While this result was proven before, the proof is rather technical compared to ours. In addition, we show that the earlier result implicitly also implies limitation at logarithmic depth $p \le \epsilon \log n$ providing an improvement over limitation at constant depth. Lastly, the results suggests that even when sub-optimised, the performance of QAOA on spin glass is equal in performance to classical algorithms in solving the mean field spin glass problem providing further evidence that the conjecture of getting the exact solution under limit swapping for the Sherrington--Kirkpatrick model to be true.

Title: XYZ ruby code: Making a case for a three-colored graphical calculus for quantum error correction in spacetime
Authors: Julio C. Magdalena de la Fuente, Josias Old, Alex Townsend-Teague, Manuel Rispler, Jens Eisert, Markus Müller
Abstract: Analyzing and developing new quantum error-correcting schemes is one of the most prominent tasks in quantum computing research. In such efforts, introducing time dynamics explicitly in both analysis and design of error-correcting protocols constitutes an important cornerstone. In this work, we present a graphical formalism based on tensor networks to capture the logical action and error-correcting capabilities of any Clifford circuit with Pauli measurements. We showcase the formalism on new Floquet codes derived from topological subsystem codes, which we call XYZ ruby codes. Based on the projective symmetries of the building blocks of the tensor network we develop a framework of Pauli flows. Pauli flows allow for a graphical understanding of all quantities entering an error correction analysis of a circuit, including different types of QEC experiments, such as memory and stability experiments. We lay out how to derive a well-defined decoding problem from the tensor network representation of a protocol and its Pauli flows alone, independent of any stabilizer code or fixed circuit. Importantly, this framework applies to all Clifford protocols and encompasses both measurement- and circuit-based approaches to fault tolerance. We apply our method to our new family of dynamical codes which are in the same topological phase as the 2+1d color code, making them a promising candidate for low-overhead logical gates. In contrast to its static counterpart, the dynamical protocol applies a Z3 automorphism to the logical Pauli group every three timesteps. We highlight some of its topological properties and comment on the anyon physics behind a planar layout. Lastly, we benchmark the performance of the XYZ ruby code on a torus by performing both memory and stability experiments and find competitive circuit-level noise thresholds of 0.18%, comparable with other Floquet codes and 2+1d color codes.

Title: Jena lectures on generalized global symmetries: principles and applications
Authors: Nabil Iqbal
Abstract: This is an elementary set of lectures on generalized global symmetries originally given at the Jena TPI School on QFT and Holography, designed to be accessible to the reader with a basic knowledge of quantum field theory. Topics covered include an introduction to higher-form symmetries with selected applications: Abelian and non-Abelian gauge theories in the continuum and on the lattice, statistical mechanical systems, the Adler-Bell-Jackiw anomaly from the point of view of non-invertible symmetry, and magnetohydrodynamics. Mathematical formalism is kept to a minimum and an emphasis is placed on understanding the global symmetry structure present in well-known models.

Title: The robustness condition for general disordered discrete time crystals, and subspace-thermal DTCs from phase transitions between different n-tuple DTCs
Authors: Hongye Yu, Tzu-Chieh Wei
Abstract: We propose a new Floquet time crystal model that responds in arbitrary multiples of the driving period. Such an $n$-tuple discrete time crystal is theoretically constructed by permuting spins in a disordered chain and is well suited for experimental implementations. Transitions between these time crystals with different periods give rise to a novel phase of matter that we call subspace-thermal discrete time crystals, where states within subspaces of definite charges are fully thermalized at an early time. However, the whole system still robustly responds to the periodic driving subharmonically, with a period being the greatest common divisor of the original two periods. Existing theoretical analysis from many-body localization cannot be used to understand the rigidity of such subspace-thermal time crystal phases. To resolve this, we develop a new theoretical framework for the robustness of DTCs from the perspective of the robust $2\pi/n$ quasi-energy gap. Its robustness is rigorously proved if the system satisfies a certain condition where the mixing length, defined by the Hamming distance of the symmetry charges, does not exceed a global threshold. The proof applies beyond the models considered here to other existing DTCs realized by kicking disordered systems, where conventional MBL-DTCs can be regarded as a special case of the subspace-thermal DTC with the subspace dimension being one, thus offering a systematic way to construct new discrete time crystal models. We also introduce the notion of DTC-charges that allow us to probe the observables that spontaneously break the time-translation symmetry in both the regular discrete time crystals and subspace-thermal discrete time crystals. Moreover, our discrete time crystal models can be generalized to systems with higher spin magnitudes or qudits, as well as to higher spatial dimensions.

Title: Quantum anomaly triggers the violation of scaling laws in gravitational system
Authors: Ya-Peng Hu, Yu-Sen An, Gao-Yong Sun, Wen-Long You, Da-Ning Shi, Hongsheng Zhang, Xiaosong Chen, Rong-Gen Cai
Abstract: Scaling laws for critical phenomena take pivotal status in almost all branches of physics. However, as scaling laws are commonly guaranteed by the renormalization group theory, systems that violate them have rarely been found. In this letter, we demonstrate that gravitational system can break scaling laws. We derive this result through investigating phase transition and critical phenomenon in a gravitational system with quantum anomaly. For the first time, we outline the key conditions to violate the scaling laws in generic gravitational system viewed from the equation of state $P=P(T,V)$. Our results indicate that quantum effects can magnify the distinctiveness of gravity, which may be significant to understand the microscopic structure of spacetime.

Title: Coherent control over the high-dimensional space of the nuclear spin of alkaline-earth atoms
Authors: Husain Ahmed, Andrea Litvinov, Pauline Guesdon, Etienne Maréchal, John H. Huckans, Benjamin Pasquiou, Bruno Laburthe-Tolra, Martin Robert-de-Saint-Vincent
Abstract: We demonstrate coherent manipulation of the nuclear degrees of freedom of ultracold ground-state strontium 87 atoms, thus providing a toolkit for fully exploiting the corresponding large Hilbert space as a quantum resource and for quantum simulation experiments with SU(N)-symmetric matter. By controlling the resonance conditions of Raman transitions with a tensor light shift, we can perform rotations within a restricted Hilbert space of two isolated spin states among the 2F+1 = 10 possible states. These manipulations correspond to engineering unitary operations deriving from generators of the SU(N) algebra beyond what can be done by simple spin precession. We present Ramsey interferometers involving an isolated pair of Zeeman states with no measurable decoherence after 3 seconds. We also demonstrate that one can harvest the large spin degrees of freedom as a qudit resource by implementing two interferometer schemes over four states. The first scheme senses in parallel multiple external fields acting on the atoms, and the second scheme simultaneously measures multiple observables of a collective atomic state - including non-commuting ones. Engineering unitary transformations of the large spin driven by other generators than the usual spin-F representation of the SU(2) group offers new possibilities from the point of view of quantum metrology and quantum many-body physics, notably for the quantum simulation of large-spin SU(N)-symmetric quantum magnetism with fermionic alkaline-earth atoms.

Title: Local vs non-local dynamics in cavity-coupled Rydberg atom arrays
Authors: Zeno Bacciconi, Hernan B. Xavier, Matteo Marinelli, Devendra Singh Bhakuni, Marcello Dalmonte
Abstract: Locality is a transversal principle that governs quantum dynamics of many-body systems. However, for cavity embedded systems, such fundamental notion is hindered by the presence of non-local cavity modes, leaving space for new possible dynamical behaviors. Here, we investigate the real-time dynamics of low-energy excitations in one dimensional Rydberg atom arrays coupled to a global cavity mode. We derive an effective description in terms of a Tavis-Cummings-Ising model, whose phase diagram features ordered and disordered phases. The non-local nature of the cavity mode drastically affects the emergent meson and string dynamics. Mesons hybridize coherently with the cavity photons, leading to composite meson-polaritons excitations. Strings, differently from local interacting theories, acquire a finite kinetic energy thanks to non-local cavity-mediated interactions between the underlying domain-walls. We then conclude by presenting a new concrete experimental blueprint for a cavity QED Rydberg atom array simulator where the physics outlined in this work can be realized.

Title: Quantum Dynamics of Dissipative Polarizable Media
Authors: Frank Ernesto Quintela Rodriguez, Piero Lafiosca, Tommaso Giovannini, Chiara Cappelli
Abstract: Classical polarizable approaches have become the gold standard for simulating complex systems and processes in the condensed phase. These methods describe intrinsically dissipative polarizable media, requiring a formal definition within the framework of open quantum systems. We present a Hamiltonian formulation for the quantum dynamics of polarizable sources based on a generalized theory of the damped harmonic oscillator, using pseudo-boson theory to characterize their coherent state dynamics. We then apply our theory to the study of the optical response of two plasmonic systems. Furthermore, by exploiting the phase space formulation of quantum mechanics and the integrability of quadratic Hamiltonians, we derive a self-consistent relation for the emitted electric field of the polarizable medium under the semiclassical approximation, based on exact formulas for medium polarization. Finally, we derive the master equation describing the open dynamics of a quantum system interacting with the quantum polarizable medium, along with analytical expressions for correlation functions calculated over arbitrary Gaussian states.

Title: Kicking Quantum Fisher Information out of Equilibrium
Authors: Florent Ferro, Maurizio Fagotti
Abstract: Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) is a ubiquitous quantity with applications ranging from quantum metrology and resource theories to condensed matter physics. In equilibrium local quantum many-body systems, the QFI of a subsystem with respect to an extensive observable is typically proportional to the subsystem's volume. Specifically, in large subsystems at equilibrium, the QFI per unit volume squared becomes negligible. We reveal a natural mechanism that amplifies the QFI in a quantum spin chain with a zero-temperature ordered phase. At zero or sufficiently low temperatures, a transient localized perturbation enhances the QFI, causing it to scale quadratically with the subsystem's length. Furthermore, this enhancement can be controlled through more general localized kicking protocols. We also revisit the behavior of the quantum Fisher information after a global quench in the thermodynamic limit, focusing on the generation of localized -- confined within compact subsystems -- multipartite entanglement. We show that the density of localized multipartite entanglement approaches zero at late times, but there is an optimal time frame proportional to the length in which subsystems fall into macroscopic quantum states. We test our predictions against numerical data obtained using a novel technique, based on a remarkable identity between quantum Fisher information and Wigner-Yanase-Dyson skew information, that allows one to compute the quantum Fisher information with respect to the order parameter in noninteracting spin chains.

Title: The complete trans-series for conserved charges in the Lieb-Liniger model
Authors: Zoltán Bajnok, János Balog, Ramon Miravitllas, Dennis le Plat, István Vona
Abstract: We determine the complete trans-series solution for the (non-relativistic) moments of the rapidity density in the Lieb-Liniger model. The trans-series is written explicitly in terms of a perturbative basis, which can be obtained from the already known perturbative expansion of the density by solving several ordinary differential equations. Unknown integration constants are fixed from Volin's method. We have checked that our solution satisfies the analytical consistency requirements including the newly derived resurgence relations and agrees with the high precision numerical solution. Our results also provides the full analytic trans-series for the capacitance of the coaxial circular plate capacitor.

Title: Yang-Mills flows for multilayered graphene
Authors: Vasilii Iugov, Nikita Nekrasov
Abstract: We clarify the origin of magic angles in twisted multilayered graphene using Yang-Mills flows in two dimensions. We relate the effective Hamiltonian describing the electrons in the multilayered graphene to the ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operator on a two dimensional torus coupled to an $SU(N)$ gauge field. Despite the absence of a characteristic class such as $c_{1}$ relevant for the quantum Hall effect, we show that there are topological invariants associated with the zero modes occuring in a family of Hamiltonians. The flatbands in the spectrum of the effective Hamiltonian are associated with Yang-Mills connections, studied by this http URL and this http URL long time ago. The emergent $U(1)$ magnetic field with nonzero flux is presumably responsible for the observed Hall effect in the absence of (external) magnetic field. We provide a numeric algorithm transforming the original single-particle Hamiltonian to the direct sum of ${\bar\partial}_{A}$ operators coupled to abelian gauge fields with non-zero $c_1$'s. Our perspective gives a simple bound for magic angles: if the gauge field $A({\alpha})$ is such that the YM energy $\Vert F_{A({\alpha})} \Vert^2$ is smaller than that of $U(1)$ magnetic flux embedded into $SU(2)$, then $\alpha$ is not magic.
