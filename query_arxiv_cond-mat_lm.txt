Title: Charge Modulation in the Vortex Halo of a Superconductor Enhances its Critical Magnetic Field
Authors: Anurag Banerjee, Catherine Pépin, Nandini Trivedi, Amit Ghosal
Abstract: When an orbital magnetic field suppresses superconductivity, forming periodic vortices in type-II superconductors, subdominant orders can emerge in the vortex cores. Rather than competing with superconductivity, we find that the emergent charge order within the halo of a vortex makes superconductivity more robust by enhancing the upper critical field. We establish that charge modulations nucleate in and around the vortex core for model parameters dictated by the underlying non-superconducting state. We further show that the spectral signatures from the Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) bound states in vortex cores track the charge modulation. The CdGM-like peak is found to shift toward the gap edge and oscillate from particle-to-hole bias from site to site, signaling charge modulation.

Title: Mechanism and Stability of Li-Dynamics in Amorphous Li-Ti-P-S Based Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor
Authors: Selva Chandrasekaran Selvaraj, Daiwei Wang, Donghai Wang, Anh T. Ngo
Abstract: Mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) exhibit both high ionic and electronic conductivity to improve the battery performance. In this work, we investigate the mechanism and stability of transport channels in recently developed our MIEC material, amorphous Ti-doped lithium phosphorus sulfide (LPS), using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a 99\% accurate machine-learning force field (MLFF) trained on \textit{ab-initio} MD data. The achieved MLFF helps efficient large-scale MD simulations on LPS with three Ti concentrations (10\%, 20\%, and 30\%) and six temperatures (25$^\mathrm{o}$C to 225$^\mathrm{o}$C) to calculate ionic conductivity, activation energy, Li-ion transport mechanism, and configurational entropy. Results show that ionic conductivities and activation energies are consistent with our recent experimental values. Moreover, Li-ion transport occurs via free-volume diffusion facilitated by the formation of disordered Li-S polyhedra. Enhanced stability of transport channels at 10\% and 20\% Ti doping, compared to 0\% and 30\%, is observed through the analysis of the vibrational and configurational entropy of these disordered Li-S polyhedra. Overall, this study highlights the utility of MLFF-based large-scale MD simulations in explaining the transport mechanism and its stability of Li-ion in Ti doped LPS electrolyte with significant computational efficiency.

Title: Anyon dispersion from non-uniform magnetic field on the sphere
Authors: Mina-Lou Schleith, Tomohiro Soejima, Eslam Khalaf
Abstract: The discovery of fractional quantum anomalous Hall states in moiré systems has raised the interesting possibility of realizing phases of itenerant anyons. Anyon dispersion is only possible in the absence of continuous magnetic translation symmetry (CMTS). Motivated by this, we consider anyons on the sphere in the presence of a non-uniform magnetic field which breaks the ${\rm SU}(2)$ rotation symmetry, the analog of CMTS on the sphere, down to a ${\rm U}(1)$. This allows us to study the energy dispersion of the anyons as a function of $L_z$ angular-momentum, while maintaining the perfect flatness of single-particle dispersion. Parametrizing the non-uniform field by a real parameter $R$ which concentrates the field at the north (south) pole for $R>1$ ($R < 1$), we use exact diagonalization to verify nonzero energy-angular momentum dispersion for any $R \neq 1$. For our choice of non-uniform field, we show that any $p$-body correlation function evaluated in the space of Laughlin quasiholes for any value of $R$ can be mapped exactly to a corresponding $p$-body correlation function in uniform field. In the thermodynamic limit, this enables us to analytically compute the interaction-generated spatially varying potential felt by the anyons and the resulting anyon dispersion exactly, up to an overall scaling constant, for the cases of short-range and Coulomb interaction. The anyon dispersion in our model describes azimuthal motion around the sphere at a constant height, similar to spin precession. Our work therefore serves as a concrete demonstration that interaction alone can generate nonzero anyon dispersion in the presence of inhomogeneous magnetic field.

Title: Origins of chalcogenide perovskite instability
Authors: Adelina Carr, Talia Glinberg, Nathan Stull, James R. Neilson, Christopher J. Bartel
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites, particularly II-IV ABS3 compounds, are a promising class of materials for optoelectronic applications. However, these materials frequently exhibit instability in two respects: 1) a preference for structures containing one-dimensional edge- or face-sharing octahedral networks instead of the three-dimensional corner-sharing perovskite framework (polymorphic instability), and (2) a tendency to decompose into competing compositions (hull instability). We evaluate the stability of 81 ABS3 compounds using Density Functional Theory, finding that only BaZrS3 and BaHfS3 are both polymorphically and hull stable, with the NH4CdCl3-type structure the preferred polymorph for 77% of these compounds. Comparison with existing tolerance factor models demonstrates that these approaches work well for known perovskites but overpredict stability for compositions without published experimental results. Polymorphic stability analysis reveals that perovskite structures are stabilized by strong B-S bonding interactions, while needle structures exhibit minimal B-S covalency, suggesting that electrostatic rather than covalent interactions drive the preference for edge-sharing motifs. Hull stability analysis comparing ABS3 to ABO3 analogues reveals a weaker inductive effect in sulfides as a possible explanation for the scarcity of sulfides compared with oxides. The relative instability of ABS3 compounds is further supported by experimental synthesis attempts. These findings provide fundamental insights into the origins of instability in chalcogenide perovskites and highlight the challenges in expanding this promising materials class beyond the few materials that have been reported to date.

Title: Optimized Gutzwiller Projected States for Doped Antiferromagnets in Fermi-Hubbard Simulators
Authors: Christian Reinmoser, Muqing Xu, Lev Haldar Kendrick, Anant Kale, Youqi Gang, Martin Lebrat, Markus Greiner, Fabian Grusdt, Annabelle Bohrdt
Abstract: In quantum many-body physics, one aims to understand emergent phenomena and effects of strong interactions, ideally by developing a simple theoretical picture. Recently, progress in quantum simulators has enabled the measurement of site resolved snapshots of Fermi-Hubbard systems at finite doping on square as well as triangular lattice geometries. These experimental advances pose the quest for theorists to analyze the ensuing data in order to gain insights into these prototypical, strongly correlated many-body systems. Here we employ machine learning techniques to optimize the mean-field parameters of a resonating valence bond (RVB) state through comparison with experimental data, thus determining a possible underlying simple model that is physically motivated and fully interpretable. We find that the resulting RVB states are capable of capturing two- as well as three-point correlations measured in experiments, even when they are not specifically used in the optimization. The analysis of the mean-field parameters and their doping dependence can be used to obtain physical insights and shed light on the nature of possible underlying quantum spin liquid states. Our results show that finite temperature data from Fermi-Hubbard quantum simulators can be well captured by RVB states. This work paves the way for a new, systematic analysis of data from numerical as well as quantum simulation of strongly correlated quantum many-body systems.

Title: Stripe order in quasicrystals
Authors: Rafael M. P. Teixeira, Eric C. Andrade
Abstract: We explore the emergence of magnetic order in geometrically frustrated quasiperiodic systems, focusing on the interplay between local tile symmetry and frustration-induced constraints. In particular, we study the $J_1$-$J_2$ Ising model on the two-dimensional Ammann-Beenker quasicrystal. Through large-scale Monte Carlo simulations and general arguments, we map the phase diagram of the model. For small $J_2$, a Néel phase appears, whereas a stripe phase is stable for dominant antiferromagnetic $J_2$, despite the system's lack of periodicity. Although long-range stripe order emerges below a critical temperature, unlike in random systems, it is softened by the nucleation of competing stripe domains pinned at specific quasiperiodic sites. This behavior reveals a unique mechanism of symmetry breaking in quasiperiodic lattices, where geometric frustration and local environment effects compete to determine the magnetic ground state. Our results show how long-range order adapts to non-periodic structures, with implications for understanding nematic phases and other broken-symmetry states in quasicrystals.

Title: Full distribution of the number of distinct sites visited by a random walker in dimension $d \ge 2$
Authors: Naftali R. Smith
Abstract: We study the full distribution $P_M(S)$ of the number of distinct sites $S$ visited by a random walker on a $d$-dimensional lattice after $M$ steps. We focus on the case $d \ge 2$, and we are interested in the long-time limit $M \gg 1$. Our primary interest is the behavior of the right and left tails of $P_M(S)$, corresponding to $S$ larger and smaller than its mean value, respectively. We present theoretical arguments that predict that in the right tail, a standard large-deviation principle (LDP) $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M\Phi\left(S/M\right)}$ is satisfied (at $M \gg 1$) for $d\ge2$, while in the left tail, the scaling behavior is $P_{M}\left(S\right)\sim e^{-M^{1-2/d}\Psi\left(S/M\right)}$, corresponding to a LDP with anomalous scaling, for $d>2$. We also obtain bounds for the scaling functions $\Phi(a)$ and $\Psi(a)$, and obtain analytical results for $\Phi(a)$ in the high-dimensional limit $d \gg 1$, and for $\Psi(a)$ in the limit $a \ll 1$ (describing the far left tail). Our predictions are validated by numerical simulations using importance sampling algorithms.

Title: Information thermodynamics of cellular ion pumps
Authors: Julian D. Jiménez-Paz, Matthew P. Leighton, David A. Sivak
Abstract: The framework of bipartite stochastic thermodynamics is a powerful tool to analyze a composite system's internal thermodynamics. It has been used to study the components of different molecular machines such as ATP synthase. However, this approach has not yet been used to describe ion-transporting proteins despite their high-level functional similarity. Here we study the bipartite thermodynamics of the sodium-potassium pump in the nonequilibrium steady state. Using a physically intuitive partition between the ATP-consuming subsystem and the ion-transporting subsystem, we find considerable information flow comparable to other molecular machines, and Maxwell-demon behavior in the ATP-consuming subsystem. We vary ion concentrations and transmembrane voltage in a range including the neuronal action potential, and find that the information flow inverts during depolarization.

Title: Tunable Photodetectors Based on 2D Hybrid Structures from Transition Metal Dichalcogenides and Photochromic Molecules
Authors: Sewon Park, Jaehoon Ji, Joakim Andreasson, Jeong Ho You, Jong Hyun Choi
Abstract: This article reviews recent progress in two-dimensional (2D) hybrid structures that integrate transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) with photochromic molecules for photodetector applications. Atomically thin TMD semiconductors offer strong light-matter interaction, tunable bandgaps, and efficient carrier transport, making them suitable for photodetectors. Photochromic molecules, capable of reversible structural changes in response to external light, can modulate their chemical, optical, and electronic properties. The combinations of various light-adaptive compounds and TMDs provide a versatile platform to explore optically programmable behaviors such as wavelength-selective photoresponse, nonvolatile switching, and multilevel memory characteristics. TMD/photochromic hybrids offer new functional capabilities that are difficult to achieve with either component alone. This mini-review summarizes material properties, interfacial integration strategies, working mechanisms, and representative device demonstrations. We conclude by highlighting future research directions toward the practical implementation of photoresponsive hybrid systems in high-performance adaptive optoelectronics.

Title: Antichiral edge states and Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces in a two-dimensional proximity-induced superconductor
Authors: Gabriel F. Rodríguez Ruiz, Juan Herrera-Mateos, Leandro Tosi, Christoph Strunk, Carlos Balseiro, Liliana Arrachea
Abstract: We show that a magnetic field parallel to the plane of a two-dimensional electron gas with Rashba spin orbit coupling in proximity to a superconductor leads to a topological phase in coexistence with a single pair of Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces. This phase hosts antichiral edge states of co-propagating Majorana fermions and are spatially localized at the opposite edges of the sample, perpendicular to the magnetic field. We discuss the characteristic signatures in the current-phase relation of a Josephson junction formed by two reservoirs in the topological phase.

Title: Theory of infrared magneto-optical effects from chiral phonons in solids
Authors: Chiara Fiorazzo, Cheol-Hwan Park, Ivo Souza, Matteo Calandra
Abstract: In crystals with broken time-reversal symmetry, zone-center phonons can acquire a finite angular momentum via velocity-dependent forces on the nuclei. Despite having the same order of magnitude as the electron spin angular momentum, the phonon angular momentum can be hard to detect because the frequency splitting is small. Here, by developing a theory of lattice magneto-optical effects in reflection and transmission, we show that infrared magnetic circular dichroism is a sensitive probe of zone-center phonon chirality. We evaluate the infrared magneto-optical Faraday, Kerr, and circular-dichroism spectra of CrI$_3$ from time-dependent density-functional theory in the adiabatic local-density approximation. We find sizeable circular dichroism from the infrared-active E$_u$ mode at $\approx 214$ cm$^{-1}$, even though the calculated splitting is only 0.22 cm$^{-1}$.

Title: Bulk Excitations of Invertible Phases
Authors: Wenjie Ji, David T. Stephen, Michael Levin, Xie Chen
Abstract: Recent developments in the study of topological defects highlight the importance of understanding the multi-dimensional structure of bulk excitations inside a quantum system. When the bulk ground state is trivial, i.e. a product state, excitations on top of it are decoupled from each other and correspond to lower-dimensional phases and their defects within. In this paper, we expand the discussion to invertible phases and study the bulk excitations in, for example, SPT phases, Majorana chains, p + ip superconductors etc. We find that there is a one-to-one correspondence between bulk excitations inside a nontrivial invertible phase and those in a product state. For SPT phases, this can be shown using the symmetric Quantum Cellular Automaton that maps from the product state to the SPT state. More generally, for invertible phases realizable using the Topological Holography construction, we demonstrate the correspondence using the fact that certain gapped boundary conditions of a topological bulk state have only relative distinctions but no absolute ones.

Title: Polymorphism Crystal Structure Prediction with Adaptive Space Group Diversity Control
Authors: Sadman Sadeed Omee, Lai Wei, Sourin Dey, Jianjun Hu
Abstract: Crystalline materials can form different structural arrangements (i.e. polymorphs) with the same chemical composition, exhibiting distinct physical properties depending on how they were synthesized or the conditions under which they operate. For example, carbon can exist as graphite (soft, conductive) or diamond (hard, insulating). Computational methods that can predict these polymorphs are vital in materials science, which help understand stability relationships, guide synthesis efforts, and discover new materials with desired properties without extensive trial-and-error experimentation. However, effective crystal structure prediction (CSP) algorithms for inorganic polymorph structures remain limited. We propose ParetoCSP2, a multi-objective genetic algorithm for polymorphism CSP that incorporates an adaptive space group diversity control technique, preventing over-representation of any single space group in the population guided by a neural network interatomic potential. Using an improved population initialization method and performing iterative structure relaxation, ParetoCSP2 not only alleviates premature convergence but also achieves improved convergence speed. Our results show that ParetoCSP2 achieves excellent performance in polymorphism prediction, including a nearly perfect space group and structural similarity accuracy for formulas with two polymorphs but with the same number of unit cell atoms. Evaluated on a benchmark dataset, it outperforms baseline algorithms by factors of 2.46-8.62 for these accuracies and improves by 44.8\%-87.04\% across key performance metrics for regular CSP.

Title: The Integral Decimation Method for Quantum Dynamics and Statistical Mechanics
Authors: Ryan T. Grimm, Alexander J. Staat, Joel D. Eaves
Abstract: We present a method to numerically evaluate functional integrals called integral decimation (ID). It constructs a separable decomposition of the integrand as a spectral tensor train (STT), a continuous generalization of the matrix product state. ID builds the STT by mapping the integrand to an auxiliary many-body wavefunction that evolves in time from an initially unentangled state. Each body-ordered term of the action corresponds to a quantum gate, applied to the state during its evolution. The gates generate entanglement, and decimation during the gate sequence compresses the integral, alleviating memory bottlenecks in high dimensional integration. In the application of ID to moment-generating and partition functions, the continuous nature of the STTs allows for analytical differentiation of the result. To demonstrate its versatility, we employ ID to calculate the partition function of a classical XY model and to solve a non-Markovian quantum relaxation problem. By circumventing the barren plateau problem that limited our earlier STT-based approaches to quantum relaxation [J. Chem. Phys. 161, 234111 (2024)], ID enables high-accuracy simulations of quantum dynamics in systems as large as a 40-site chain.

Title: Semi-empirical Pseudopotential Method for Monolayer Transitional-Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Raj Kumar Paudel, Chung-Yuan Ren, Yia-Chung Chang
Abstract: We present a Semiempirical Pseudopotential Method for accurately computing the band structures and Bloch states of monolayer transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), including MoS2, MoSe2, WS2, and WSe2. Our approach combines local and non-local pseudopotentials, carefully fitted to replicate fully self-consistent density-functional theory results, while using only a minimal set of empirical parameters. By expressing the total potential as a sum of a few separable components, we achieve both accuracy and computational efficiency. The resulting pseudopotentials are transferable to more complex systems such as bilayer, trilayer, and moire superlattices, offering a reliable foundation for large-scale simulations. When integrated with artificial intelligence techniques, this method provides a powerful tool for the design and exploration of TMDC-based nanodevices for next-generation optoelectronic applications.

Title: In-Plane Ni-O-Ni Bond Angles as Structural Fingerprints of Superconductivity in Layered Nickelates: Effects of Pressure, Strain, Layering, and Correlations
Authors: Bipasa Samanta, Alexandru B. Georgescu
Abstract: We investigate the structural and electronic conditions conducive to superconductivity in layered nickelates using density functional theory with Hubbard corrections (DFT+$U$). For both the bilayer and 1-3 polymorphs of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$, we find that the in-plane Ni-O-Ni bond angles under pressure strongly correlate with the experimentally observed superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) dome, and may serve as a reasonable proxy. Under compressive strain, the bond angles straighten, peaking near 2\% strain-consistent with experimental reports of superconductivity in strained bilayer thin films. However, the bond angles at this strain are more bent than those achieved under hydrostatic pressure, correlating with a lower $T_c$. We show that increasing the number of NiO$_2$ layers, as in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$, or substituting heavier rare-earth elements (e.g., Pr) raises the pressure required to reach the structural configuration associated with superconductivity. Our results indicate that these systems require higher external pressure to achieve in-plane bond straightening. Varying the on-site Coulomb interaction $U$ reveals that stronger electronic correlations delay the structural transition and favor high-spin states. This suggests that moderate correlation strength may be optimal for superconductivity, with stronger correlation preventing the formation of favorable bond geometries. Electronic structure analysis shows that the Ni $e_g$ orbitals dominate near the Fermi level and shift downward with pressure, enhancing Ni-O hybridization. These results highlight how pressure and strain tune structural features that may be essential for engineering high-$T_c$ phases in nickelate superconductors.

Title: Compressed self-avoiding walks in two and three dimensions
Authors: C J Bradly, N R Beaton, A L Owczarek
Abstract: We consider the phase transition induced by compressing a self-avoiding walk in a slab where the walk is attached to both walls of the slab in two and three dimensions, and the resulting phase once the polymer is compressed. The process of moving between a stretched situation where the walls pull apart to a compressed scenario is a phase transition with some similarities to that induced by pulling and pushing the end of the polymer. However, there are key differences in that the compressed state is expected to behave like a lower dimensional system, which is not the case when the force pushes only on the endpoint of the polymer. We use scaling arguments to predict the exponents both of those associated with the phase transition and those in the compressed state and find good agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect caused by magnetic hopfions
Authors: Börge Göbel, Samir Lounis
Abstract: Magnetic hopfions are non-collinear spin textures that are characterized by an integer topological invariant, called Hopf index. The three-dimensional magnetic solitons can be thought of as a tube with a twisted magnetization that has been closed at both ends to form a torus. The tube consists of a magnetic whirl called in-plane skyrmion or bimeron. Although hopfions have been observed by microscopy techniques, their detection remains challenging as they lack an electronic hallmark so far. Here we predict a three-dimensional orbital Hall effect caused by hopfion textures: When an electric field is applied, the hopfion generates a transverse current of orbital angular momentum. The effect arises due to the local emergent field that gives rise to in-plane and out-of-plane orbital Hall conductivities. This orbital Hall response can be seen as a hallmark of hopfions and allows us to distinguish them from other textures, like skyrmioniums, that look similar in real-space microscopy experiments. While the two-dimensional topological invariant of a skyrmion determines its topological Hall transport, the unique three-dimensional topological orbital Hall effect can be identified with the three-dimensional topological invariant that is the Hopf index. Our results make hopfions attractive for spin-orbitronic applications because their orbital signatures allow for their detection in devices and give rise to large orbital torques.

Title: Universal Scaling Laws for Deep Indentation Beyond the Hertzian Regime
Authors: Tong Mu, Changhong Linghu, Yanju Liu, Jinsong Leng, Huajian Gao, K. Jimmy Hsia
Abstract: Deep indentation of soft materials is ubiquitous across scales in nature and engineering, yet accurate predictions of contact behaviors under extreme deformations ($\delta/R > 1$) remain elusive due to geometric and material nonlinearities. Here, we investigate the indentation of rigid spheres into soft elastic substrates, resolving the highly nonlinear regime where the sphere becomes fully submerged. A universal geometric mapping approach reveals Hertz-type pressure distributions in the deformed configuration, validated by FEA. Closed-form solutions for contact force and radius agree with simulations up to $\delta/R = 2.5$. Experiments spanning soft polymers (Ecoflex, PDMS), food substrates (tofu), and biological tissues (octopus) validate the derived scaling law for hyperelastic materials. Our results establish a universal framework for extreme mechanical interactions, with applications in soft robotics, bioengineered systems, and tissue mechanics.

Title: Approach to network failure due to intrinsic fluctuations
Authors: Shaunak Roy, Vimal Kishore, M. S. Santhanam
Abstract: A networked system can fail when most of its components are unable to support flux through the nodes and edges. As studied earlier this scenario can be triggered by an external perturbation such as an intentional attack on nodes or for internal reasons such as due to malfunction of nodes. In either case, the asymptotic failure of the network is preceded by a cascade of nodal failures. In this work, we focus on the nodal failure arising from the intrinsic fluctuations in the flux passing through the nodes. By modeling these as extreme events, it is shown that three distinct nodal failure regimes can be identified before a complete network failure takes place. Further, the approach to network failure through the three regimes is shown to be qualitatively similar on a square lattice, all-to-all, scale free, and Erdos-Renyi networks. We obtain approximate analytical description of the approach to failure for an all-to-all network. This is also demonstrated numerically for real transportation network of flights.

Title: Uni-Traveling-Carrier Photodiode Based on MoS2/GaN van der Waals Heterojunction for High-Speed Visible-Light Detection
Authors: Takuya Kadowaki, Takahiro Serikawa, Akihide Ichikawa, Yuji Ohmaki, Koji Usami, Yoichi Kawakami, Yoshihiro Iwasa, Hisashi Ogawa
Abstract: Uni-traveling-carrier photodiodes (UTC-PDs), which utilize only electrons as the active carriers, have become indispensable in high-speed optoelectronics due to their unique capabilities, such as high saturation power and broad bandwidth. However, extending the operating wavelengths into the visible region for wider applications is challenging due to the lack of suitable wide-bandgap III-V semiconductor combinations with the necessary band alignment and lattice matching. Here, we show that a UTC-PD based on a van der Waals heterojunction composed of a 2D transition metal dichalcogenide, molybdenum disulfide (MoS2), as a photoabsorption layer and a gallium nitride (GaN) film as a carrier transport layer, offers a solution to this challenge. The fast vertical carrier transport across the heterointerface is enabled by the direct epitaxial growth of a MoS2 layer on a GaN film. Our device demonstrates a frequency response in the several-GHz range with a quantum efficiency on the order of 1% throughout the entire visible spectrum, highlighting the promise for high-speed visible optoelectronics.

Title: Topologically nontrivial and trivial flat bands via weak and strong interlayer coupling in twisted bilayer honeycomb optical lattices for ultracold atoms
Authors: Wenjie Sui, Wei Han, Zheng Vitto Han, Zengming Meng, Jing Zhang
Abstract: In recent years, flat electronic bands in twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) have attracted significant attention due to their intriguing topological properties, extremely slow electron velocities, and enhanced density of states. Extending twisted bilayer systems to new configurations is highly desirable, as it offers promising opportunities to explore flat bands beyond TBG. Here, we study both topological and trivial flat bands in a twisted bilayer honeycomb lattice for ultracold atoms and present the evolution of the flat bands with different interlayer coupling strength (ICS). Our results demonstrate that an isolated topological flat band can emerge at the Dirac point energy for a specific value of weak ICS, referred to as the ``critical coupling". This occurs over a wide range of twist angles, surpassing the limits of the magic angle in TBG systems. When the ICS is slightly increased beyond the critical coupling value, the topological flat band exhibits degenerate band crossings with both the upper and lower adjacent bands at the high-symmetry $\Gamma_s$ point. As the ICS is further increased into the strong coupling regime, trivial flat bands arise around Dirac point energy. Meanwhile, more trivial flat bands appear, extending from the lowest to higher energy bands, and remain flat as the ICS increases. The topological properties of the flat bands are studied through the winding pattern of the Wilson loop spectrum. Our research provides deeper insights into the formation of flat bands in ultracold atoms with highly controllable twisted bilayer optical lattices, and may contribute to the discovery of new strongly correlated states of matter.

Title: Magnon-magnon interaction induced by nonlinear spin wave dynamics
Authors: Matteo Arfini, Alvaro Bermejillo-Seco, Artem Bondarenko, Clinton A. Potts, Yaroslav M. Blanter, Herre S. J. van der Zant, Gary A. Steele
Abstract: We experimentally and theoretically demonstrate that nonlinear spin-wave dynamics can induce an effective resonant interaction between non-resonant magnon modes in a yttrium iron garnet disk. Under strong pumping near the ferromagnetic resonance mode, we observe a spectral splitting that emerges with increasing drive amplitude. This phenomenon is well captured by a theoretical framework based on the linearization of a magnon three-wave mixing Hamiltonian, which at high power leads to parametric Suhl instabilities. The access and control of nonlinear magnon-parametric processes enables the development of experimental platforms in an unexplored parameter regime for both classical and quantum computation protocols.

Title: Transport-Generated Signals Uncover Geometric Features of Evolving Branched Structures
Authors: Fabian H. Kreten, Ludger Santen, Reza Shaebani
Abstract: Branched structures that evolve over time critically determine the function of various natural and engineered systems, including growing vasculature, neural arborization, pulmonary networks such as lungs, river basins, power distribution networks, and synthetic flow media. Inferring the underlying geometric properties of such systems and monitoring their structural and morphological evolution is therefore essential. However, this remains a major challenge due to limited access and the transient nature of the internal states. Here, we present a general framework for recovering the geometric features of evolving branched structures by analyzing the signals generated by tracer particles during transport. As tracers traverse the structure, they emit detectable pulses upon reaching a fixed observation point. We show that the statistical properties of this signal intensity -- which reflect underlying first-passage dynamics -- encode key structural features such as network extent, localized trapping frequency, and bias of motion (e.g., due to branch tapering). Crucially, this method enables inference from externally observable quantities, requiring no knowledge of individual particle trajectories or internal measurements. Our approach provides a scalable, non-invasive strategy for probing dynamic complex geometries across a wide range of systems.

Title: Quantum quenches with long range interactions
Authors: Marianna Sorba, Nicolò Defenu, Gesualdo Delfino
Abstract: We extend the theory of quantum quenches to the case of $d$-dimensional homogeneous systems with long range interactions. This is achieved treating the long range interactions as switched on by the quench and performing the derivation within the basis of asymptotic states of the short range interacting pre-quench theory. In this way we analytically determine the post-quench state and the one-point functions of local observables such as the order parameter. One implication is that, as in the short range case, some oscillations induced by the quench remain undamped at large times under conditions specified by the theory. This explains, in particular, why such undamped oscillations have been numerically observed also in presence of long range interactions.

Title: Can the Oxygen $2p$ Band Be Hole Doped?
Authors: Thi Ngoc Huyen Vu, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: The development of $p$-type oxide semiconductors remains impeded by the inherently low-lying valence-band maximum (VBM) dominated by O-2$p$ states. A prevailing approach to mitigate this limitation is to elevate the VBM by introducing cation states that hybridize with O-2$p$ orbitals or lie energetically above the O-2$p$ level. Nevertheless, the $p$-type oxides reported to date exhibit limited hole mobilities. To expand the search space, it is essential to accurately understand the intrinsic difficulty of introducing holes into O-2$p$ orbitals. Accordingly, we evaluated 845 oxides to identify those in which holes can be doped into O-2$p$ bands. Our high-throughput screening revealed CaCdO$_2$ as the only promising exemplar, in which the VBM is slightly hybridized with deep-lying Cd-3$d$ states. Our screening suggests that hole doping into O-2$p$ orbitals is extremely difficult and thus reinforces the effectiveness of the traditional ``VBM-raising strategy.''

Title: How oxygen influences the catalytic activity of iron during carbon nanotube nucleation
Authors: Ben McLean, Alister J. Page, Feng Ding
Abstract: The catalytic activity of metal nanoparticles toward nucleation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) is fundamental to achieving structure-controlled growth using catalytic chemical vapor deposition (CVD). Despite the success of oxidized catalysts in SWCNT growth, there is a lack of understanding regarding how oxygen influences the catalysts and the nucleation process. Quantum chemical molecular dynamics (MD) simulations employing density functional tight binding (DFTB) demonstrate that the kinetics of carbon nucleation on an iron nanoparticle catalyst can be tuned via oxygen loading. Increasing the oxygen content in the catalyst leads to activation of surface-bound carbon species and enhanced carbon chain growth due to respective weakening and strengthening of the C-C and Fe-C bonding. This is due to oxygen modulating the electronic structure of the iron catalyst, with the Fermi level of the catalyst increasing proportionally with oxygen content until the iron:oxygen stoichiometry reaches parity. The increase in Fe 3d states near the Fermi level also promotes the donation of electron density into unoccupied C 2p states, activating C-C bonds which in turn facilitates carbon chain growth and slows carbon ring condensation.

Title: Universal Relation between Spectral and Wavefunction Properties at Criticality
Authors: Simon Jiricek, Miroslav Hopjan, Vladimir Kravtsov, Boris Altshuler, Lev Vidmar
Abstract: Quantum-chaotic systems exhibit several universal properties, ranging from level repulsion in the energy spectrum to wavefunction delocalization. On the other hand, if wavefunctions are localized, the levels exhibit no level repulsion and their statistics is Poisson. At the boundary between quantum chaos and localization, however, one observes critical behavior, not complying with any of those characteristics. An outstanding open question is whether there exist yet another type of universality, which is genuine for the critical point. Previous work suggested that there may exist a relation between the global characteristics of energy spectrum, such as spectral compressibility $\chi$, and the degree of wavefunction delocalization, expressed via the fractal dimension $D_1$ of the Shannon--von Neumann entropy in a preferred (e.g., real-space) basis. Here we study physical systems subject to local and non-local hopping, both with and without time-reversal symmetry, with the Anderson models in dimensions three to five being representatives of the first class, and the banded random matrices as representatives of the second class. Our thorough numerical analysis supports validity of the simple relation $\chi + D_1 = 1$ in all systems under investigation. Hence we conjecture that it represents a universal property of a broad class of critical models. Moreover, we test and confirm the accuracy of our surmise for a closed-form expression of the spectral compressibility in the one-parameter critical manifold of random banded matrices. Based on these findings we derive a universal function $D_{1}(r)$, where $r$ is the averaged level spacing ratio, which is valid for a broad class of critical systems.

Title: Topological Signatures of Magnetic Phase Transitions with Majorana Fermions through Local Observables and Quantum Information
Authors: Karyn Le Hur, Fan Yang, Magali Korolev
Abstract: The one-dimensional (1D) $J_1-J_2$ quantum spin model can be viewed as a strong-coupling analogue of the Schrieffer-Su-Heeger model with two inequivalent alternating Ising couplings along the wire, associated to the physics of resonating valence bonds. Similar to the quantum Ising model, which differently presents a long-range Neel ordered phase, this model also maps onto a p-wave superconducting wire which shows a topological phase transition with the emergence of low-energy Majorana fermions. We show how signatures of the topological phase transition for the p-wave superconducting wire, i.e. a half Skyrmion, are revealed through local (short-range) spin observables and their derivatives related to the capacitance of the pairing fermion model. Then, we present an edge correspondence through the edge spin susceptibility in the $J_1-J_2$ model revealing that the topological phase transition is a metal of Majorana fermions. We justify that the spin magnetization at an edge at very small transverse magnetic field is a good marker of the topological invariant. We identify a correspondence between the quantum information of resonating valence bonds and the charge fluctuations in a p-wave superconductor through our method ``the bipartite fluctuations''. This $J_1-J_2$ system may be realized in materials and engineered in quantum circuits, optical lattices.

Title: PAMBE growth of GaN nanowires on metallic ZrN buffers -- a critical impact of ZrN layer thickness on the growth temperature
Authors: Karol Olszewski, Zbigniew R. Zytkiewicz, Aleksandra Wierzbicka, Marek Guziewicz, Marta Sobanska
Abstract: An impact of thin metallic ZrN layers on Si and sapphire wafers on substrate temperature during MBE growth of GaN nanowires is studied. Using nucleation kinetics of GaN as a sensitive probe we show that a thin ZrN layer strongly increases the substrate temperature, which significantly affects the dimensions and density of the nanowires. To quantify the effect we developed a technique of optical pyrometer calibration that allows reliable determination of emissivity, and thus precise measurement of temperature of substrates with unknown optical parameters, such as ZrN buffers of various thicknesses. Our results show that emissivity of ZrN-coated Si and sapphire wafers differs significantly from the bulk ZrN and increases drastically for films thinner than ~100 nm. Simple calculations indicate that ignoring the influence of the thin film may lead to huge errors in temperature readings and consequently to losing the growth control. Then, we show that we can compensate for the impact of ZrN buffer on substrate temperature and grow identical nanowire arrays on Si substrates with and without ZrN layers. Finally, having identical arrays of GaN nanowires we used X-ray diffraction to compare nanowire arrangements on Si and ZrN/Si substrates with a thin SiN nucleation layer.

Title: Vane rheology of a fiber-reinforced granular material
Authors: Ladislas Wierzchalek, Georges Gauthier, Baptiste Darbois-Texier
Abstract: The addition of a small quantity of flexible fibers in a granular material is an efficient technique to increase the yield stress of the material. While the influence of fiber addition on the mechanical strength of granular media has been studied, much less is known about the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures. In this article, we explore the effect of flexible fibers on the flow behavior of grain-fiber mixtures above the yield stress. We use a vane geometry to study the rheology of a dry granular material mixed with flexible fibers with different volume fractions and properties. The vane is immersed in the material, and the granular pressure increases with the depth of immersion. When the vane begins rotating, we observe a transient regime, which depends on the number of blades and is associated with the mobilization of material between the blades. Following this transient phase, a stationary regime is reached. By measuring and modeling the stationary flow that develops around the vane, we deduce the effective friction coefficient of the material from the torque measured on the vane. Following this approach, we investigate the effect of the fiber volume fraction and the aspect ratio on the effective friction coefficient of the grain-fiber mixture. Our results show that the effective friction coefficient increases linearly with fiber volume fraction and exponentially with fiber aspect ratio. These findings provide new fundamental insights into the flow properties of grain-fiber mixtures.

Title: Magnon-plasmon hybridization mediated by Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction in two-dimensional crystals: tuning with electric field
Authors: Wojciech Rudziński, Mirali Jafari, Józef Barnaś, Anna Dyrdał
Abstract: Recently, a mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization in ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic systems, based on spin-orbit interaction associated with mobile (conduction) electrons has been proposed. Here, we consider another mechanism of magnon-plasmon hybridization, which is based on spin-orbit coupling attributed to localized spins and leading to the antisymmetric exchange (Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya) interaction. The basic element of the mechanism of magnon-plasmon coupling relies on the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya interaction by the electric field associated with plasmons. We show, that the modification of the Dzialoshinskii-Moriya components due to electric field accompanied by plasmons may lead to hybridization of magnons and plasmons. Moreover, we also show that an external electric field normal to the layer (due to a gate voltage, for instance) can be used as a tool to tune the strength of the magnon-plasmon coupling.

Title: Inverse Thermodynamics: Designing Interactions for Targeted Phase Behavior
Authors: Camilla Beneduce, Giuseppe Mastriani, Petr Šulc, Francesco Sciortino, John Russo
Abstract: The traditional goal of inverse self-assembly is to design interactions that drive particles toward a desired target structure. However, achieving successful self-assembly also requires tuning the thermodynamic conditions under which the structure is stable. In this work, we extend the inverse design paradigm to explicitly address this challenge by developing a framework for inverse thermodynamics, i.e. the design of interaction potentials that realize specific thermodynamic behavior. As a step in this direction, using patchy particle mixtures as a model system, we demonstrate how precise control over both bonding topology and bond energetics enables the programming of targeted phase behavior. In particular, we establish design principles for azeotropic demixing and show how to create mixtures that exhibit azeotropy at any prescribed composition. Our predictions are validated through Gibbs-ensemble simulations [A.Z. Panagiotopoulos,Molecular Physics 61, 813-826 (1987)]. These results highlight the necessity of coupling structural design with thermodynamic engineering, and provide a blueprint for controlling complex phase behavior in multi-component systems.

Title: Current-Controlled Magnon-Magnon Coupling in an On-Chip Cavity Resonator
Authors: Hanchen Wang, William Legrand, Richard Schlitz, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: Harnessing spin currents to control magnon dynamics enables new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we demonstrate current-controlled magnon-magnon coupling between cavity and boundary modes in an ultrathin film of Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). Cavity modes emerge in a BiYIG region between two Pt nanostripes, where interfacial anisotropy modifies the magnon dispersion. These modes hybridize with boundary magnons confined within the Pt-capped BiYIG, resulting in an anticrossing gap. Modeling based on dipole-exchange spin-wave dispersion accurately reproduces the observed modes and their hybridization. Spin current injection via the spin Hall effect in a Pt nanostripe disrupts the cavity boundary conditions and suppresses both cavity modes and hybridization upon driving the system beyond the damping compensation threshold. Furthermore, tuning the microwave power applied to a microstrip antenna enables controlled detuning of the anticrossing gap. Our findings provide a platform for exploring spin current-magnon interactions and designing on-chip reconfigurable magnonic devices.

Title: Beyond Characteristic Equations: A Unified Non-Bloch Band Theory via Wavefunction Data
Authors: Haoshu Li
Abstract: Non-Hermitian systems play a central role in nonequilibrium physics, where determining the energy spectrum under open boundary conditions is a fundamental problem. Non-Bloch band theory, based on the characteristic equation $\text{det}[E - H(\beta)] = 0$, has emerged as a key tool for this task. However, we show that this framework becomes insufficient in systems with certain symmetries, where identical characteristic equations can yield different spectra. To resolve this, we develop a unified theory that incorporates additional wavefunction information beyond the characteristic equation. Our framework accurately captures spectral properties such as the energy spectrum and the end-to-end signal response in a broad class of systems, particularly those with high symmetry. It reveals the essential role of wavefunction information and symmetry in shaping non-Hermitian band theory.

Title: Bridging a gap: A heavy elastica between point supports
Authors: Grace K. Curtis, Ian M. Griffiths, Dominic Vella
Abstract: We study the deformation and slip-through of a heavy elastic beam suspended above two point supports and subject to an increasing body force -- an idealized model of a fibre trapped in the pores of a filter as flow strength increases, for example. Using both asymptotic and numerical techniques, we investigate the behaviour of the beam under increasing body force and the maximum force that can be supported before it must slip between the supports. We quantify this maximum body force as a function of the separation between the two supports. Surprisingly, we show the existence of a critical separation below which the beam can withstand an arbitrarily large body force, even in the absence of friction. This is understood as the limit of a catenary between the supports that is connected to (and supported by the tension in) a vertically hanging portion outside the supports. We explore how frictional forces impact the deformation and load-bearing capacity of the beam and show that our results are consistent with laboratory experiments.

Title: Orbital Pumping in Ferrimagnetic Insulators
Authors: Hanchen Wang, Min-Gu Kang, Davit Petrosyan, Shilei Ding, Richard Schlitz, Lauren J. Riddiford, William Legrand, Pietro Gambardella
Abstract: We report the detection of pure orbital currents generated by both coherent and thermal magnons in the magnetic insulator Bi-doped yttrium iron garnet (BiYIG). The pumping of orbital and spin currents is jointly investigated in nano-devices made of naturally oxidized Cu, pure Cu, Pt, and Cr. The absence of charge conduction in BiYIG and the negligible spin-to-charge conversion of oxidized Cu allows us to disambiguate the orbital current contribution. Comparative measurements on YIG and BiYIG show that the origin of the orbital pumping in BiYIG/oxidized Cu is the dynamics of the orbital magnetization in the magnetic insulator. In Cr, the pumping signal is dominated by the negative spin Hall effect rather than the positive orbital Hall effect, indicating that orbital currents represent a minority of the total angular momentum current pumped from the magnetic insulator. Our results also evidence that improving the interfacial transparency significantly enhances pumping efficiencies not only for spin, but also for orbital currents.

Title: Thermal conductivity minimum with thickness in ultrathin films
Authors: Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The thermal properties of solids under nanoscale confinement are currently not understood at the atomic level. Recent numerical studies have highlighted the presence of a minimum in the thermal conductivity as a function of thickness for ultrathin films at a thickness about 1-2 nm, which cannot be described by existing theories. We develop a theoretical description of thin films which predicts a new physical law for heat transfer at the nanoscale. In particular, due to the strong redistribution of phonon momentum states in reciprocal space (with a transition from a spherical Debye surface to a different homotopy group $\mathbb{Z}$ at strong confinement), the low-energy phonon density of states no longer follows Debye's law but rather a cubic law with frequency, which then crosses over to Debye's law at a crossover frequency proportional to the average speed of sound of the material and inversely proportional to the film thickness. Concomitantly, this implies that the phonon population becomes dominated by low-energy phonons as confinement increases, which then leads to a higher thermal conductivity under extreme confinement. The theory is able to reproduce the thermal conductivity minimum in recent molecular simulations data for ultrathin silicon and provides useful guidelines as to tune the minimum position based on the mechanical properties of the material.

Title: Towards 4D modelisation of thermal-field emission from semiconductors
Authors: Salvador Barranco Cárceles, Aquila Mavalankar, Veronika Zadin, Ian Underwood, Andreas Kyritsakis
Abstract: The theoretical picture of thermal field-emission (TFE) from semiconductors has been limited to 1D and 2D models. This can be attributed to the complex and interdependent phenomena that is involved in TFE from semiconductors which makes the calculations cumbersome. Such limitations result in a partial understanding of the underlying physics of semiconducting surfaces under high electrical fields, which requires the addition of the temporal dimension (4D) to yield a realistic model. Here we develop a 3D model of TFE from semiconductors that can take arbitrary geometries and doping levels. Our model successfully reproduces the characteristic saturation plateau of some semiconductors, as well as its dependence in temperature. The model is found to be in good agreement with experimental data from ntype Germanium at a qualitative level. We propose this model as a platform for future extensions into the full 4D framework, incorporating temporal dynamics for a more complete and predictive description of thermal-field emission from semiconductors.

Title: Hydrodynamics of chiral nematics in a channel and sudden contraction geometry
Authors: Isreal Morawo, Dana Grecov
Abstract: This study investigates the influence of chirality, viscous effects, and confinement geometry on the flow dynamics and defect structures of cholesteric liquid crystals (CLCs) using numerical simulations. As chiral strength increases, $\pi$-twist defects form at low chirality and progressively organize into hexagonal domains resembling blue phase--like (BP-like) structures at higher chirality. At sufficiently high chirality and aspect ratios, skyrmion-like configurations emerge, indicating the formation of dynamic analogs of equilibrium phases under flow. Sudden contraction geometries reveal how aspect ratio and elastic interactions promote flow disturbances and defect development. Analyses of velocity and scalar order parameter ($S$) distributions demonstrate strong coupling between molecular alignment and hydrodynamic fields, with localized vortices forming around $\tau^-$ defects in regions of low $S$ and velocity. Temporal evaluations of velocity fluctuations uncover chaotic flow regimes at low Ericksen numbers, characterized by irregular defect motion and skewed probability density functions. These findings offer new insights into CLC structure formation and flow behavior, with potential applications in defect engineering, microfluidics, soft robotics, and photonic materials.

Title: Quick starch guide: A perspective on shear thickening in dense non-Brownian suspensions
Authors: Cécile Clavaud, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: In this article, we provide a brief perspective on recent developments in the study of shear thickening in dense suspensions. We give a rapid overview of the state of the art and discuss current models aiming to describe this particular rheology. Although most of the experiments and simulation studies are conducted in "ideal" flows, where the sample is confined without an open boundary condition, we have decided to highlight more realistic flow conditions. We further provide an overview on how to relate the recently proposed constitutive models to these more practical flow conditions like pipe flow or flow down an incline.

Title: Quantum Critical Eliashberg Theory
Authors: Ilya Esterlis, Joerg Schmalian
Abstract: Quantum criticality plays a central role in understanding non-Fermi liquid behavior and unconventional superconductivity in strongly correlated systems. In this review, we explore the quantum critical Eliashberg theory, which extends conventional Eliashberg approaches to non-Fermi liquid regimes governed by critical fluctuations. We discuss the theoretical foundations and recent developments in the field, focusing on the interplay between electronic interactions and bosonic modes near quantum phase transitions as described in the Yukawa-coupled version of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model. Special emphasis is placed on the breakdown of quasiparticle coherence, anomalous scaling behaviour, Cooper pairing without quasiparticles, and emergent universality in different physical settings. Starting from a zero-dimensional "quantum-dot" model, we discuss the generalization to higher spatial dimensions and demonstrate the connection between quantum-critical Eliashberg theory and holographic superconductivity. Our analysis provides a perspective on how quantum criticality shapes the dynamics of strongly correlated metals and superconductors.

Title: Synaptic plasticity in Co/Nb:STO memristive devices: The role of oxygen vacancies
Authors: Walter Quiñonez, Anouk Goossens, Diego Rubi, Tamalika Banerjee, María José Sánchez
Abstract: Neuromorphic computing aims to develop energy-efficient devices that mimic biological synapses. One promising approach involves memristive devices that can dynamically adjust their electrical resistance in response to stimuli, similar to synaptic weight changes in the brain. However, a key challenge is understanding and controlling the coexistence of different types of synaptic plasticity, such as short-term and long-term plasticity. In this work, we show that plasticity behaviors in Co/Nb:STO Schottky memristors originate from oxygen vacancy electromigration, which modulates the Schottky barrier and enables both short-term and long-term plasticity. Our experiments reveal that resistance changes follow a power-law during reading (short-term plasticity) and increase stepwise with successive pulses (long-term memory retention). These behaviors are successfully reproduced by our model, which demonstrates the correlation between oxygen vacancy distribution and Schottky barrier modulation. Our findings highlight these memristors as promising candidates for neuromorphic applications.

Title: Most probable paths for active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles
Authors: Sandipan Dutta
Abstract: Fluctuations play an important role in the dynamics of stochastic systems. In particular, for small systems, the most probable thermodynamic quantities differ from their averages because of the fluctuations. Using the Onsager Machlup variational formalism we analyze the most probable paths for non-equilibrium systems, in particular active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particles (AOUP), and investigate how the entropy production along these paths differ from the average entropy production. We investigate how much information about their non-equilibrium nature can be obtained from their extremum paths and how these paths depend on the persistence time and their swim velocities. We also look at how the entropy production along the most probable paths varies with the active noise and how it differs from the average entropy production. This study would be useful to design artificial active systems with certain target trajectories.

Title: Exploring light-induced phases of 2D materials in a modulated 1D quasicrystal
Authors: Yifei Bai, Anna R. Dardia, Toshihiko Shimasaki, David M. Weld
Abstract: Illuminating integer quantum Hall matter with polarized light can drive quantum phase transitions. Technical limitations on laser intensity and material purity make such experiments challenging in the solid state. However, the Harper-Hofstadter mapping which relates a two-dimensional integer quantum Hall system to a 1D quasicrystal enables the same polarization-dependent light-induced phase transitions to be observed using a quantum gas in a driven quasiperiodic optical lattice. We report experimental results from such a 1D quantum simulator of 2D integer quantum Hall matter driven by light of variable polarization. We observe an interlaced phase diagram of localization-delocalization phase transitions as a function of drive polarization and amplitude. Elliptically polarized driving can stabilize an extended critical phase featuring multifractal wavefunctions; we observe signatures of this phenomenon in subdiffusive transport. In this regime, increasing the strength of the quasiperiodic potential can enhance rather than suppress transport. These experiments demonstrate a simple method for synthesizing exotic multifractal states and exploring light-induced quantum phases across different dimensionalities.

Title: Ising versus infinite randomness criticality in arrays of Rydberg atoms trapped with non-perfect tweezers
Authors: Jose Soto-Garcia, Natalia Chepiga
Abstract: Chains of Rydberg atoms have emerged as an amazing platform for simulating quantum physics in low dimensions. This remarkable success is due to the versatility of lattice geometries achieved by trapping neutral atoms with optical tweezers. On a given lattice, the competition between the repulsive van der Waals potential and the detuning of the laser frequency brings the atoms to highly excited Rydberg states, leading to a variety of exotic phases and quantum phase transitions. Experiments on the simplest one-dimensional array of Rydberg atoms have stimulated tremendous progress in understanding quantum phase transitions into crystalline phases. In addition to standard conformal transitions, numerical simulations have predicted two exotic chiral transitions and a floating phase, raising the question of their experimental realization. However, in reality, optical tweezers have a finite width, which results in small deviations in interatomic distances and disorder in interaction strength. However, disorder can affect the nature of transitions. Infinite randomness criticality in the random transverse-field Ising chain is perhaps the most prominent examples. In this paper, we demonstrate how the disorder typical for Rydberg experiments alters the Ising transition to the period-2 phase. Following the experimental protocol closely, we probe the nature of quantum criticality with Kibble-Zurek dynamics. While we clearly observe infinite randomness for strong disorder and large system sizes, we also report a crossover into a clean Ising transition, which is visible for small system sizes and weak disorder. Our results clearly demonstrate an additional technical constraint on the scalability of Rydberg-based quantum simulators.

Title: Robustness of Floquet topological phase at room temperature: a first-principles dynamics study
Authors: Ruiyi Zhou, Yosuke Kanai
Abstract: Nonadiabatic Thouless pumping of electrons is studied within the framework of topological Floquet engineering, particularly focused on how atomic lattice dynamics affect the emergent Floquet topological phase in trans-polyacetylene under the driving electric field. As similarly done in the earlier work [Zhou and Kanai, J. Phys. Chem. Lett., 12, 4496 (2021)], the real-time time-dependent density functional theory and Ehrenfest dynamics simulations were used to investigate the extent to which the number of pumped charges remains equal to the topological invariant, the winding number, when the temperature effect of ions and the dynamical coupling of electrons and ions are taken into account. Our theoretical work shows that the Floquet topological phase remains intact but the condition on the driving field necessary for observing the topological phase becomes more limiting.

Title: Entropy production in active Rouse polymers
Authors: Sandipan Dutta
Abstract: Active polymers are the archetype of nonequilibrium viscoelastic systems that constantly consume energy to produce motion. The activity of many biopolymers is essential to many life processes. The entropy production rate quantifies their nonequilibrium nature through the breaking of the time reversal symmetry. In this work we build an analytical model of active polymers as active Rouse polymers where the beads are active Ornstein Uhlenbeck particles and calculate their entropy production. The interactions between the beads are decoupled through the normal mode analysis and the entropy production can be solved analytically. We obtain the contribution of each Rouse mode in the entropy production and the dependence of the entropy production on the polymer properties like length. We find that the entropy production is zero for a passive Rouse polymer in the presence of thermal bath as well as for an active Rouse polymer in the absence of thermal bath. For an active chain in the presence of a thermal bath the entropy production is nonzero. In this case we find that the local temporal entropy production dominates the nonlocal entropy production.

Title: PolyMicros: Bootstrapping a Foundation Model for Polycrystalline Material Structure
Authors: Michael Buzzy, Andreas Robertson, Peng Chen, Surya Kalidindi
Abstract: Recent advances in Foundation Models for Materials Science are poised to revolutionize the discovery, manufacture, and design of novel materials with tailored properties and responses. Although great strides have been made, successes have been restricted to materials classes where multi-million sample data repositories can be readily curated (e.g., atomistic structures). Unfortunately, for many structural and functional materials (e.g., mesoscale structured metal alloys), such datasets are too costly or prohibitive to construct; instead, datasets are limited to very few examples. To address this challenge, we introduce a novel machine learning approach for learning from hyper-sparse, complex spatial data in scientific domains. Our core contribution is a physics-driven data augmentation scheme that leverages an ensemble of local generative models, trained on as few as five experimental observations, and coordinates them through a novel diversity curation strategy to generate a large-scale, physically diverse dataset. We utilize this framework to construct PolyMicros, the first Foundation Model for polycrystalline materials (a structural material class important across a broad range of industrial and scientific applications). We demonstrate the utility of PolyMicros by zero-shot solving several long standing challenges related to accelerating 3D experimental microscopy. Finally, we make both our models and datasets openly available to the community.

Title: The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Considerations Regarding Force, Time-Dependence, and Berry Phase
Authors: Igor Kuzmenko, Y. B. Band, Yshai Avishai
Abstract: The relation of the Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect and the force on a particle having a magnetic moment is explored. The general form of the AC Hamiltonian is derived using the Foldy-Wouthuysen transformation to the Dirac equation. Geometries in which an analytic expression for the phase can be obtained are examined, as well as the relation of the AC phase to the Berry phase. The AC phase is determined for an arbitrary homogeneous electric field; it is quadratic (linear) in the field strength for small (large) electric field strengths.

Title: Resolving Discrepancies in Wood Micromechanics: Strain-Mapped Compression of Tracheid Wall Micropillars
Authors: Júlio O. Amando de Barros, Jakob Schwiedrzik, Falk K. Wittel
Abstract: Wood's increasing role as a structural resource in sustainable materials selection demands accurate characterization of its mechanical behavior. Its performance arises from a hierarchical structure, where the dominant load-bearing component is the S2 layer of tracheid cell walls-a thick, fiber-reinforced composite of cellulose microfibrils embedded in hemicelluloses and lignin. Due to the small dimensions and anisotropic nature of the S2 layer, mechanical testing presents significant challenges, particularly in producing homogeneous stress and strain fields. In this study, we apply micropillar compression (MPC) combined with digital image correlation (DIC) to Norway spruce tracheids, enabling direct and model-free strain measurements at the cell wall scale. Micropillars were oriented at different microfibril angles (MFAs), confirming the expected dependence of stiffness and yield stress on ultrastructural alignment, with higher stiffness and yield stress at low MFAs. For these under compression fibril-aligned kink bands occurred, while shear related failure was observed at higher angles. A parameter study on the acceleration voltage of the Scanning Electron Microscope revealed that electron beam exposure significantly degrades pillar integrity, which could explain data scatter and mechanical underestimation in earlier MPC studies. By controlling imaging protocols and using DIC-based strain measurements, we report the highest direct measurements of wood cell wall stiffness to date-up to 42 GPa for MFA=0°-closer matching micromechanical model predictions compared to previous results. Findings are compared with Finite Element Method-based displacement corrections to establish a robust protocol for probing soft, anisotropic biological composites' mechanical behavior while clarifying longstanding inconsistencies in reported results of wood MPC measurements.

Title: Roughening Transition in Quantum Circuits
Authors: Hyunsoo Ha, David A. Huse, Grace M. Sommers
Abstract: We explore a roughening phase transition that occurs in the entanglement dynamics of certain quantum circuits. Viewing entanglement as the free energy of a membrane in a circuit-defined random environment, there is a competition between membrane smoothing due to lattice pinning and roughening due to disorder in the circuit. In particular, we investigate the randomness-induced roughening transition of the entanglement membrane in a (3+1)-dimensional Clifford circuit model, by calculating the entanglement entropy for various bipartitions. We further construct a scaling theory for membranes tilted away from lattice planes, uncovering new scaling forms and a crossover to a previously unexplored critical "tilted regime".

Title: Free Probability in a Minimal Quantum Circuit Model
Authors: Felix Fritzsch, Pieter W. Claeys
Abstract: Recent experimental and theoretical developments in many-body quantum systems motivate the study of their out-of-equilibrium properties through multi-time correlation functions. We consider the dynamics of higher-order out-of-time-order correlators (OTOCs) in a minimal circuit model for quantum dynamics. This model mimics the dynamics of a structured subsystem locally coupled to a maximally random environment. We prove the exponential decay of all higher-order OTOCs and fully characterize the relevant time scales, showing how local operators approach free independence at late times. We show that the effects of the environment on the local subsystem can be captured in a higher-order influence matrix, which allows for a Markovian description of the dynamics provided an auxiliary degree of freedom is introduced. This degree of freedom directly yields a dynamical picture for the OTOCs in terms of free cumulants from free probability, consistent with recent predictions from the full eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). This approach and the relevant influence matrix are expected to be applicable in more general settings and present a first step to characterizing quantum memory in higher-order OTOCs.

Title: Homogeneous Free-Standing Nanostructures from Bulk Diamond over Millimeter Scales for Quantum Technologies
Authors: Andrea Corazza, Silvia Ruffieux, Yuchun Zhu, Claudio A. Jaramillo Concha, Yannik Fontana, Christophe Galland, Richard J. Warburton, Patrick Maletinsky
Abstract: Quantum devices based on optically addressable spin qubits in diamond are promising platforms for quantum technologies such as quantum sensing and communication. Nano- and microstructuring of the diamond crystal is essential to enhance device performance, yet fabrication remains challenging and often involves trade-offs in surface quality, aspect ratio, device size, and uniformity. We tackle this hurdle with an approach producing millimeter-scale, thin (down to 70 nm) and highly parallel (< 0.35 nm/$\mu$m}) membranes from single-crystal diamond. The membranes remain contamination-free and possess atomically smooth surfaces ($\mathrm{R_q}$ < 200 pm) as required by state-of-the-art quantum applications. We demonstrate the benefits and versatility of our method by fabricating large fields of free-standing and homogeneous photonic nano- and microstructures. Leveraging a refined photolithography-based strategy, our method offers enhanced scalability and produces robust structures suitable for direct use, while remaining compatible with heterogeneous integration through pick-and-place transfer techniques.

Title: Many-Body Neural Network Wavefunction for a Non-Hermitian Ising Chain
Authors: Lavoisier Wah, Remmy Zen, Flore K. Kunst
Abstract: Non-Hermitian (NH) quantum systems have emerged as a powerful framework for describing open quantum systems, non-equilibrium dynamics, and engineered quantum optical materials. However, solving the ground-state properties of NH systems is challenging due to the exponential scaling of the Hilbert space, and exotic phenomena such as the emergence of exceptional points. Another challenge arises from the limitations of traditional methods like exact diagonalization (ED). For the past decade, neural networks (NN) have shown promise in approximating many-body wavefunctions, yet their application to NH systems remains largely unexplored. In this paper, we explore different NN architectures to investigate the ground-state properties of a parity-time-symmetric, one-dimensional NH, transverse field Ising model with a complex spectrum by employing a recurrent neural network (RNN), a restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM), and a multilayer perceptron (MLP). We construct the NN-based many-body wavefunctions and validate our approach by recovering the ground-state properties of the model for small system sizes, finding excellent agreement with ED. Furthermore, for larger system sizes, we demonstrate that the RNN outperforms both the RBM and MLP. However, we show that the accuracy of the RBM and MLP can be significantly improved through transfer learning, allowing them to perform comparably to the RNN for larger system sizes. These results highlight the potential of neural network-based approaches--particularly for accurately capturing the low-energy physics of NH quantum systems.

Title: Controlling quantum chaos via Parrondo strategies on NISQ hardware
Authors: Aditi Rath, Dinesh Kumar Panda, Colin Benjamin
Abstract: Advancements in Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) computing are steadily pushing these systems toward outperforming classical supercomputers on specific, well-defined computational tasks. In this work, we explore and control quantum chaos in NISQ systems using discrete-time quantum walks (DTQW) on cyclic graphs. To efficiently implement quantum walks on NISQ hardware, we employ the quantum Fourier transform (QFT) to diagonalize the conditional shift operator, optimizing circuit depth and fidelity. We experimentally realize the transition from quantum chaos to order via DTQW dynamics on both odd and even cyclic graphs, specifically 3- and 4-cycle graphs, using the counterintuitive Parrondo's paradox strategy across three different NISQ devices. While the 4-cycle graphs exhibit high-fidelity quantum evolution, the 3-cycle implementation shows significant fidelity improvement when augmented with dynamical decoupling pulses. Our results demonstrate a practical approach to probing and harnessing controlled chaotic dynamics on real quantum hardware, laying the groundwork for future quantum algorithms and cryptographic protocols based on quantum walks.

Title: Passive radiative cooling using temperature-dependent emissivity can sometimes outperform static emitters
Authors: Yeonghoon Jin, Jin-Woo Cho, Mikhail A. Kats
Abstract: In passive sky-facing radiative cooling, wavelength-selective thermal emitters in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m can reach lower temperatures compared to broadband emitters, but broadband emitters always have higher cooling power when the emitter is warmer than the ambient. Here, we propose a temperature-tunable thermal emitter that switches between a wavelength-selective state -- with high emissivity only in the atmospheric transparency window of 8-13 $\mu$m -- and a broadband-emissive state with high emissivity in the 3-25 $\mu$m range, thus maintaining high cooling potential across all temperatures. We also propose a realization of such a temperature-tunable emitter using the phase transition of vanadium dioxide (VO$_2$), which can be tuned to the ambient temperature using a combination of doping and defect engineering.

Abstract: We present a coarse-grained stochastic model for axonal extension on periodic arrays of parallel micropatterns that integrates three key biophysical mechanisms: (i) the molecular clutch that couples actin retrograde flow to substrate adhesions, (ii) an active biopolymer-based mechanism generating traction-force fluctuations, and (iii) the mechanical interaction of the growth cone with the micropatterned substrate. Using the Shannon-Jaynes maximum entropy principle with constraints derived from experimental observations, we derive a unique probability distribution for the colored acceleration noise that enters the Langevin equation. The resulting stationary process exhibits power-law temporal correlations with negative exponent, which accounts for the observed superdiffusive dynamics of axons. For biologically relevant parameters the model predicts this exponent to be -1/2, in close quantitative agreement with measurements of cortical neurons cultured on patterned substrates.

Title: In situ studies of a molten metal anode ablation in a nearly atmospheric pressure DC arc
Authors: Stanislav Musikhin, Valerian Nemchinsky, Hengfei Gu, Bruce E. Koel, Yevgeny Raitses
Abstract: A DC arc with a meltable metal anode in a near-atmospheric pressure hydrocarbon gas is an emerging method for producing single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs). In these systems, evaporation of the molten metal anode determines the formation of catalyst seed particles needed for SWCNT growth, and therefore, should be monitored, controlled, and optimized. Evaluating the anode ablation rate by weighing the anode before and after a synthesis run is unfeasible due to anode carburization in the hydrocarbon atmosphere. To overcome this, we implemented a high-speed, 2D, 2-color pyrometry for reliable temperature measurements of the molten anode in a DC arc. The obtained temperature fields were used to calculate the anode ablation rates. Results showed the importance of resolving the arc and molten pool dynamics, as well as addressing the issue of reflections. Furthermore, significant changes in ablation rates were revealed upon addition of CH4, which must be considered when scaling up the production of SWCNTs.

Title: Multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a versatile approach to 4D-STEM precession
Authors: Stephanie M. Ribet, Rohan Dhall, Colin Ophus, Karen C. Bustillo
Abstract: Precession of a converged beam during acquisition of a 4D-STEM dataset improves strain, orientation, and phase mapping accuracy by averaging over continuous angles of illumination. Precession experiments usually rely on integrated systems, where automatic alignments lead to fast, high-quality results. The dependence of these experiments on specific hardware and software is evident even when switching to non-integrated detectors on a precession tool, as experimental set-up becomes challenging and time-consuming. Here, we introduce multi-angle precession electron diffraction (MAPED): a method to perform precession electron diffraction by collecting sequential 4D-STEM scans at different incident beam tilts. The multiple diffraction datasets are averaged together post-acquisition, resulting in a single dataset that minimizes the impact of the curvature and orientation of the Ewald sphere relative to the crystal under study. Our results demonstrate that even four additional tilts improved measurement of material properties, namely strain and orientation, as compared to single-tilt 4D-STEM experiments. We show the versatility and flexibility of our few-tilt precession approach with data collected on a number of microscopes with different hardware configurations and a variety of detectors.

Title: InGaN Nanopixel Arrays on Single Crystal GaN Substrate
Authors: Nirmal Anand, Sadat Tahmeed Azad, Christy Giji Jenson, Dipon Kumar Ghosh, Md Zunaid Baten, Pei-Cheng Ku, Grzegorz Muziol, Sharif Sadaf
Abstract: Indium gallium nitride (InGaN) quantum well (QW) micro- and nano-scale light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are vital to the next-generation optoelectronic applications such as ultrahigh-speed optical interconnects and near-eye augmented/virtual reality displays. However, scaling to nanoscale dimensions introduces several challenges, including an increased nonradiative recombination from surface states and defect-related emission degradation. In this work, we present a high-performance, strain-relaxed nanoscale LED array, fabricated using a top-down nanostructuring approach applied to a high-quality, all-InGaN (quantum well/barrier) LED structure grown by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy (PAMBE) on bulk GaN substrates. Combining an ultra-low threading dislocation density bulk GaN substrate and effective sidewall passivation with atomic layer deposition (ALD) results in excellent diode rectification characteristics and extremely low leakage currents. Electroluminescence measurements reveal bright blue emission with a peak external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 0.46% at an elevated injection current density of ~1.2 kA/cm2.

Title: Quantum Circuits for the Metropolis-Hastings Algorithm
Authors: Baptiste Claudon, Pablo Rodenas-Ruiz, Jean-Philip Piquemal, Pierre Monmarché
Abstract: Szegedy's quantization of a reversible Markov chain provides a quantum walk whose mixing time is quadratically smaller than that of the classical walk. Quantum computers are therefore expected to provide a speedup of Metropolis-Hastings (MH) simulations. Existing generic methods to implement the quantum walk require coherently computing the acceptance probabilities of the underlying Markov kernel. However, reversible computing methods require a number of qubits that scales with the complexity of the computation. This overhead is undesirable in near-term fault-tolerant quantum computing, where few logical qubits are available. In this work, we present a quantum walk construction which follows the classical proposal-acceptance logic, does not require further reversible computing methods, and uses a constant-sized ancilla register. Since each step of the quantum walk uses a constant number of proposition and acceptance steps, we expect the end-to-end quadratic speedup to hold for MH simulations.

Title: The QUEST Database of Highly-Accurate Excitation Energies
Authors: Pierre-François Loos, Martial Boggio-Pasqua, Aymeric Blondel, Filippo Lipparini, Denis Jacquemin
Abstract: We report theoretical best estimates of vertical transition energies (VTEs) for a large number of excited states and molecules: the \textsc{quest} database. This database includes 1489 \emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ VTEs (731 singlets, 233 doublets, 461 triplets, and 64 quartets) for both valence and Rydberg transitions occurring in molecules containing from 1 to 16 non-hydrogen atoms. \textsc{Quest} also includes a significant list of VTEs for states characterized by a partial or genuine double-excitation character, known to be particularly challenging for many computational methods. The vast majority of the reported values are deemed chemically-accurate, that is, are within $\pm0.05$ eV of the FCI/\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ estimate. This allows for a balanced assessment of the performance of popular excited-state methodologies. We report the results of such benchmarks for various single- and multi-reference wavefunction approaches, and provide extensive supporting information allowing testing of other models. All corresponding data associated with the \textsc{quest} database, along with analysis tools, can be found in the associated \textsc{GitHub} repository at the following URL: this https URL.

Title: Gapless neutron superfluidity in the crust of the accreting neutron stars KS 1731-260 and MXB 1659-29
Authors: Valentin Allard, Nicolas Chamel
Abstract: The interpretation of the thermal evolution of the transiently accreting neutron stars MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 after an outburst is challenging, both within the traditional deep-crustal heating paradigm and the thermodynamically consistent approach of Gusakov and Chugunov that accounts for neutron diffusion throughout the crust. All these studies assume that the neutron superfluid in the crust is at rest. However, we have recently shown that a finite superflow could exist and could lead to a new gapless superfluid phase if quantized vortices are pinned. We have revisited the cooling of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 and we have found that gapless superfluidity could naturally explain their late time cooling. We pursue here our investigation by performing new simulations of the thermal relaxation of the crust of MXB 1659-29 and KS 1731-260 within a Markov Chain Monte Carlo method accounting for neutron diffusion and allowing for gapless superfluidity. We have varied the global structure of the neutron star, the composition of the heat-blanketing envelope, and the mass accretion rate. In all cases, observations are best fitted by models with gapless superfluidity. Finally, we make predictions that could be tested by future observations.

Title: Suppressing excitations in the nonlinear Landau-Zener model
Authors: Sebastian Deffner, Steve Campbell
Abstract: Many complex quantum systems can be described by effectively nonlinear dynamics. While such dynamics have many appealing characteristics, they also make the analysis significantly more involved. This is due to the fact that only a few analytical treatments exist, and that the language of quantum mechanics is built for linear operators. For instance, the very formulation of the quantum adiabatic theorem requires the underlying dynamics to be linear. In this work we show that in a generalized Landau-Zener model, nonlinear dynamics can be leveraged to suppress excitations and coherences of the corresponding linear scenario. To this end, we introduce a generalized "energy spectrum", which is defined by the expectation values of the energy under the stationary states. As a main result, we show that the nonlinear term in the evolution equation acts like an effective shortcut to adiabaticity for the linear Landau-Zener problem.

Title: Solving Inverse Problems in Stochastic Self-Organising Systems through Invariant Representations
Authors: Elias Najarro, Nicolas Bessone, Sebastian Risi
Abstract: Self-organising systems demonstrate how simple local rules can generate complex stochastic patterns. Many natural systems rely on such dynamics, making self-organisation central to understanding natural complexity. A fundamental challenge in modelling such systems is solving the inverse problem: finding the unknown causal parameters from macroscopic observations. This task becomes particularly difficult when observations have a strong stochastic component, yielding diverse yet equivalent patterns. Traditional inverse methods fail in this setting, as pixel-wise metrics cannot capture feature similarities between variable outcomes. In this work, we introduce a novel inverse modelling method specifically designed to handle stochasticity in the observable space, leveraging the capacity of visual embeddings to produce robust representations that capture perceptual invariances. By mapping the pattern representations onto an invariant embedding space, we can effectively recover unknown causal parameters without the need for handcrafted objective functions or heuristics. We evaluate the method on two canonical models--a reaction-diffusion system and an agent-based model of social segregation--and show that it reliably recovers parameters despite stochasticity in the outcomes. We further apply the method to real biological patterns, highlighting its potential as a tool for both theorists and experimentalists to investigate the dynamics underlying complex stochastic pattern formation.

Title: Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures
Authors: Xiao Chai, Jeremy L. Tanlimco, Eber Nolasco-Martinez, Xuanwei Liang, E. Quinn Simmons, Eric Zhu, Roshan Sajjad, Hector Mas, S. Nicole Halawani, David M. Weld
Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.

Title: Measurement-based quantum computation with variable-range interacting systems
Authors: Debkanta Ghosh, Keshav Das Agarwal, Pritam Halder, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: We demonstrate that weighted graph states (WGS) generated via variable-range interacting Ising spin systems where the interaction strength decays with distance as a power law, characterized by the fall-off rate, can successfully implement single- and two-qubit gates with fidelity exceeding classical limits by performing suitable measurements. In the regime of truly long-range interactions (small fall-off rate), optimizing over local unitary operations, while retaining the local measurement scheme in the original measurement-based quantum computation (MBQC) set-up, enables the scheme to achieve nonclassical average fidelities. Specifically, we identify a threshold fall-off rate of the interaction above which the fidelity of both universal single- and two-qubit gates consistently exceeds $90\%$ accuracy. Moreover, we exhibit that the gate-implementation protocol remains robust under two realistic imperfections -- noise in the measurement process, modeled via unsharp measurements, and disorder in the interaction strengths. These findings confirm WGS produced through long-range systems as a resilient and effective resource for MBQC.

Title: Nanoscale Magnetic Resonance Imaging and Control of a Strongly Interacting Dipolar System
Authors: Piotr Put, Nathaniel T. Leitao, Christina Spaegele, Haoyang Gao, Oksana Makarova, Bartholomeus Machielse, Hengyun Zhou, Federico Capasso, Leigh S. Martin, Hongkun Park, Mikhail D. Lukin
Abstract: Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is a fundamental tool for physical and life sciences, yet its spatial resolution is typically limited to macroscopic scales. Here, we demonstrate nanoscale MRI by combining strong, time-dependent local magnetic field gradients with coherent control of a dense ensemble of electron spins hosted in atom-like defects in diamond. Using this platform, we generate and manipulate nanoscale spin textures - spatially structured patterns of spin orientation - and track their evolution under engineered many-body interactions. Controlling the dipolar spin exchange driving the dynamics, we observe striking signatures of sensitivity to the microscopic details underlying the polarization distribution. Our results open the door for robust control of metrologically useful entanglement, and nanoscale imaging of materials and biological systems under ambient conditions.

Title: Hilbert subspace imprint: a new mechanism for non-thermalization
Authors: Hui Yu, Jiangping Hu, Shi-Xin Zhang
Abstract: The search for non-ergodic mechanisms in quantum many-body systems has become a frontier area of research in non-equilibrium physics. In this Letter, we introduce Hilbert subspace imprint (HSI)-a novel mechanism that enables evasion of thermalization and bridges the gap between quantum many-body scars (QMBS) and Hilbert space fragmentation (HSF). HSI manifests when initial states overlap exclusively with a polynomial scaling (with system size) set of eigenstates. We demonstrate this phenomenon through two distinct approaches: weak symmetry breaking and initial state engineering. In the former case, we observe that ferromagnetic states including those with a single spin-flip display non-thermal behavior under weak U(1) breaking, while antiferromagnetic states thermalize. In contrast, the Z2-symmetric model shows thermalization for both ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic states. In the latter case, we engineer the initial state prepared by shallow quantum circuits that enhance the overlap with the small target subspace. Our results establish HSI as a mechanism equally fundamental to non-thermalization as QMBS and HSF.

Title: Bubble Dynamics Transformer: Microrheology at Ultra-High Strain Rates
Authors: Lehu Bu, Zhaohan Yu, Shaoting Lin, Jan N. Fuhg, Jin Yang
Abstract: Laser-induced inertial cavitation (LIC)-where microscale vapor bubbles nucleate due to a focused high-energy pulsed laser and then violently collapse under surrounding high local pressures-offers a unique opportunity to investigate soft biological material mechanics at extremely high strain rates (>1000 1/s). Traditional rheological tools are often limited in these regimes by loading speed, resolution, or invasiveness. Here we introduce novel machine learning (ML) based microrheological frameworks that leverage LIC to characterize the viscoelastic properties of biological materials at ultra-high strain rates. We utilize ultra-high-speed imaging to capture time-resolved bubble radius dynamics during LIC events in various soft viscoelastic materials. These bubble radius versus time measurements are then analyzed using a newly developed Bubble Dynamics Transformer (BDT), a neural network trained on physics-based simulation data. The BDT accurately infers material viscoelastic parameters, eliminating the need for iterative fitting or complex inversion processes. This enables fast, accurate, and non-contact characterization of soft materials under extreme loading conditions, with significant implications for biomedical applications and materials science.

Title: Near-extremal holographic charge correlators
Authors: Blaise Goutéraux, David M. Ramirez, Mikel Sanchez-Garitaonandia, Clément Supiot
Abstract: We analytically compute the low-temperature charge correlators in near-extremal black holes with a planar horizon and an infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ extremal geometry, finding excellent agreement with numerical calculations. The analytical result consistently describes the crossover between the hydrodynamic diffusive regime at low frequencies and wavenumbers, and the quantum, zero-temperature regime at high frequencies and wavenumbers. We analytically resolve the successive collisions between the diffusive pole and the non-hydrodynamic poles sourced by the infrared $\mathrm{AdS}_2\times \Bbb{R}^2$ geometry. We demonstrate that in the $T=0$ limit, a pair of gapless poles survive with a dispersion relation $\omega_\pm=-i d_2 k^2-i d_4 k^4-i\tilde d_4 k^4(\pm i\pi+\log k^2) $. The nonanalytic contributions arise from the interplay with the branch cut formed by the condensation of the non-hydrodynamic poles. The real part is caused by the `snatching' of one of the non-hydrodynamic poles by the hydrodynamic diffusive pole.

Title: Interpretable representation learning of quantum data enabled by probabilistic variational autoencoders
Authors: Paulin de Schoulepnikoff, Gorka Muñoz-Gil, Hendrik Poulsen Nautrup, Hans J. Briegel
Abstract: Interpretable machine learning is rapidly becoming a crucial tool for scientific discovery. Among existing approaches, variational autoencoders (VAEs) have shown promise in extracting the hidden physical features of some input data, with no supervision nor prior knowledge of the system at study. Yet, the ability of VAEs to create meaningful, interpretable representations relies on their accurate approximation of the underlying probability distribution of their input. When dealing with quantum data, VAEs must hence account for its intrinsic randomness and complex correlations. While VAEs have been previously applied to quantum data, they have often neglected its probabilistic nature, hindering the extraction of meaningful physical descriptors. Here, we demonstrate that two key modifications enable VAEs to learn physically meaningful latent representations: a decoder capable of faithfully reproduce quantum states and a probabilistic loss tailored to this task. Using benchmark quantum spin models, we identify regimes where standard methods fail while the representations learned by our approach remain meaningful and interpretable. Applied to experimental data from Rydberg atom arrays, the model autonomously uncovers the phase structure without access to prior labels, Hamiltonian details, or knowledge of relevant order parameters, highlighting its potential as an unsupervised and interpretable tool for the study of quantum systems.

Title: DFT+U+J with linear response parameters predicts non-magnetic oxide band gaps with hybrid-functional accuracy
Authors: Daniel S. Lambert, David D. O'Regan
Abstract: First-principles Hubbard-corrected approximate density-functional theory (DFT+U) is a low-cost, potentially high throughput method of simulating materials, but it has been hampered by empiricism and inconsistent band-gap correction in transition-metal oxides. DFT+U property prediction of non-magnetic systems such as d0 and d10 transition-metal oxides is typically faced with excessively large calculated Hubbard U values, and with difficulty in obtaining acceptable band-gaps and lattice volumes. Meanwhile, Hund's exchange coupling J is an important but often neglected component of DFT+U, and the J parameter has proven challenging to directly calculate by means of linear response. In this work, we provide a revised formula for computing Hund's J using established self-consistent field DFT+U codes. For non-magnetic systems, we introduce a non-approximate technique for calculating U and J simultaneously in such codes, at no additional cost. Using unmodified Quantum ESPRESSO, we assess the resulting values using two different DFT+U functionals incorporating J, namely the widely used DFT+(U-J) and the readily available DFT+U+J. We assess a test set comprising TiO2, ZrO2, HfO2, Cu2O and ZnO, and apply the corrections both to metal and oxygen centered pseudoatomic subspaces. Starting from the PBE functional, we find that DFT+(U-J) is significantly out-performed in band-gap accuracy by DFT+U+J, the mean absolute band-gap error of which matches that of the hybrid functional HSE06. ZnO, a long-standing challenge case for DFT+U, is addressed by means of Zn 4s instead of Zn 3d correction, whereupon the first-principles DFT+U+J band-gap error falls to half of that reported for HSE06, yet remains larger than for PBE0.

Title: A universally applicable approach to connectivity percolation
Authors: Fabian Coupette, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: Percolation problems appear in a large variety of different contexts ranging from the design of composite materials to vaccination strategies on community networks. The key observable for many applications is the percolation threshold. Unlike the universal critical exponents, the percolation threshold depends explicitly on the specific system properties. As a consequence, theoretical approaches to the percolation threshold are rare and generally tailored to the specific application. Yet, any percolating cluster forms a discrete network the emergence of which can be cast as a graph problem and analyzed using branching processes. We propose a general mapping of any kind of percolation problem onto a branching process which provides rigorous lower bounds of the percolation threshold. These bounds progressively tighten as we incorporate more information into the theory. We showcase our approach for different continuum problems finding accurate predictions with almost no effort. Our approach is based on first principles and does not require fitting parameters. As such it offers an important theoretical reference in a field that is dominated by simulation studies and heuristic fit functions.

Title: The coupled-cluster self-energy
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.

Title: Probing the Topology of Fermionic Gaussian Mixed States with {U(1)} symmetry by Full Counting Statistics
Authors: Liang Mao, Hui Zhai, Fan Yang
Abstract: Topological band theory has been studied for free fermions for decades, and one of the most profound physical results is the bulk-boundary correspondence. Recently a focus in topological physics is extending topological classification to mixed states. Here, we focus on Gaussian mixed states where the modular Hamiltonians of the density matrix are quadratic free fermion models with {U(1)} symmetry and can be classified by topological invariants. The bulk-boundary correspondence is then manifested as stable gapless modes of the modular Hamiltonian and degenerate spectrum of the density matrix. In this article, we show that these gapless modes can be detected by the full counting statistics, mathematically described by a function introduced as {F(\theta)}. A divergent derivative at {\theta=\pi} can be used to probe the gapless modes in the modular Hamiltonian. Based on this, a topological indicator, whose quantization to unity senses topologically nontrivial mixed states, is introduced. We present the physical intuition of these results and also demonstrate these results with concrete models in both one- and two-dimensions. Our results pave the way for revealing the physical significance of topology in mixed states.

Title: Edge currents as probe of topology in twisted cuprate bilayers
Authors: Vedangi Pathak, Oguzhan Can, Marcel Franz
Abstract: Bilayers made of high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Bi$_2$Sr$_2$CaCu$_2$O$_{8+x}$ assembled with a twist angle close to $45^\circ$ have been recently shown to spontaneously break time reversal symmetry $\mathcal{T}$, consistent with theoretical predictions for emergent chiral topological $d_{x^2-y^2}+id_{xy}$ phase in such twisted $d$-wave superconductors. Here we use a minimal microscopic model to estimate the size of spontaneous chiral edge currents expected to occur in the $\mathcal{T}$-broken phase. In accord with previous theoretical studies of chiral $d$-wave superconductors we find small but non-vanishing edge currents which we nevertheless predict to be above the detection threshold of the state-of-the-art magnetic scanning probe microscopy. In addition, by deriving a simple relation between the edge current and the electron spectral function we help elucidate the longstanding disparity between the size of edge currents in chiral $d$-wave and $p$-wave superconductors.

Title: Observation of dendrite formation at Li metal-electrolyte interface: A machine-learning enhanced constant potential framework
Authors: Taiping Hu, Haichao Huang, Guobing Zhou, Xinyan Wang, Jiaxin Zhu, Zheng Cheng, Fangjia Fu, Xiaoxu Wang, Fuzhi Dai, Kuang Yu, Shenzhen Xu
Abstract: Uncontrollable dendrites growth during electrochemical cycles leads to low Coulombic efficiency and critical safety issues in Li metal batteries. Hence, a comprehensive understanding of the dendrite formation mechanism is essential for further enhancing the performance of Li metal batteries. Machine learning accelerated molecular dynamics (MD) simulations can provide atomic-scale resolution for various key processes at an ab-initio level accuracy. However, traditional MD simulation tools hardly capture Li electrochemical depositions, due to lack of an electrochemical constant potential (ConstP) condition. In this work, we propose a ConstP approach that combines a machine learning force field with the charge equilibration method to reveal the dynamic process of dendrites nucleation at Li metal anode surfaces. Our simulations show that inhomogeneous Li depositions, following Li aggregations in amorphous inorganic components of solid electrolyte interphases, can initiate dendrites nucleation. Our study provides microscopic insights for Li dendrites formations in Li metal anodes. More importantly, we present an efficient and accurate simulation method for modeling realistic ConstP conditions, which holds considerable potential for broader applications in modeling complex electrochemical interfaces.

Title: Polydispersity in Percolation
Authors: Fabian Coupette, Tanja Schilling
Abstract: Every realistic instance of a percolation problem is faced with some degree of polydispersity, e.g., the pore-size distribution of an inhomogeneous medium, the size distribution of filler particles in composite materials, or the vertex degree of agents in a social network. Studies on different classes of systems have independently found very similar conceptual results for the percolation problem, i.e., that the percolation threshold is insensitive to the particular distribution controlling the polydispersity. Rather, the percolation threshold depends only on the first few moments of the distribution. In this article, we explain this frequently observed pattern using branching processes. The key observation is that a reasonable degree of polydispersity effectively does not alter the structure of the network that forms at the percolation threshold. As a consequence, the critical parameters of the monodisperse system can be analytically continued to account for polydispersity.

Title: Anyonic Braiding in a Chiral Mach-Zehnder Interferometer
Authors: Bikash Ghosh, Maria Labendik, Liliia Musina, Vladimir Umansky, Moty Heiblum, David F. Mross
Abstract: Fractional quantum statistics are the defining characteristic of anyons. Measuring the phase generated by an exchange of anyons is challenging, as standard interferometry setups -- such as the Fabry-Pérot interferometer -- suffer from charging effects that obscure the interference signal. Here, we present the observation of anyonic interference and exchange phases in an optical-like Mach-Zehnder interferometer based on co-propagating interface modes. By avoiding backscattering and deleterious charging effects, this setup enables pristine and robust Aharonov-Bohm interference without any phase slips. At various fractional filling factors, the observed flux periodicities agree with the fundamental fractionally charged excitations that correspond to Jain states and depend only on the bulk topological order. To probe anyonic statistics, we use a small, charged top-gate in the interferometer bulk to induce localized quasiparticles without modifying the Aharonov-Bohm phase; however, with introducing periodic phase slips. The magnitude of the observed phase slips and their signs align with the expected value at filling 1/3, but their direction shows systematic deviations at fillings 2/5 and 3/7. Control over added individual quasiparticles in this design is essential for measuring the coveted non-Abelian statistics in the future.

Title: Anyon Superconductivity from Topological Criticality in a Hofstadter-Hubbard Model
Authors: Stefan Divic, Valentin Crépel, Tomohiro Soejima, Xue-Yang Song, Andrew Millis, Michael P. Zaletel, Ashvin Vishwanath
Abstract: We argue that the combination of strong repulsive interactions and high magnetic fields can generate electron pairing and superconductivity. Inspired by the large lattice constants of moiré materials, which make large flux per unit cell accessible at laboratory fields, we study the triangular lattice Hofstadter-Hubbard model at one-quarter flux quantum per plaquette, where previous literature has argued that a chiral spin liquid separates a weak-coupling integer quantum Hall phase and a strong-coupling topologically-trivial antiferromagnetic insulator at a density of one electron per site. We argue that topological superconductivity emerges upon doping in the vicinity of the integer quantum Hall to chiral spin liquid transition. We employ exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group methods to examine this theoretical scenario and find that electronic pairing indeed occurs on both sides of criticality over a remarkably broad range of interaction strengths. On the chiral spin liquid side, our results provide a concrete model realization of the long-hypothesized mechanism of anyon superconductivity. Our study thus establishes a beyond-BCS mechanism for electron pairing in a well-controlled limit, relying crucially on the interplay between electron correlations and band topology.

Title: Non-Fermi Liquids from Subsystem Symmetry Breaking in van der Waals Multilayers
Authors: Archisman Panigrahi, Ajesh Kumar
Abstract: We investigate the spontaneous breaking of subsystem symmetry in a stack of two-dimensional Fermi liquid metals, each maintaining a subsystem number conservation symmetry, driven by interlayer exciton condensation. The resulting Goldstone modes in this broken symmetry phase couple to the quasiparticle current perpendicular to the layers. This coupling, which remains non-zero for small momentum transfers, leads to the emergence of a three-dimensional anisotropic marginal Fermi liquid state when the number of layers is sufficiently large. We propose a possible experimental realization of this phenomenon in two-dimensional multilayer van der Waals heterostructures. Using self-consistent mean-field calculations, we characterize the subsystem symmetry-broken metallic state and examine the effects of fluctuations on its physical properties within the random phase approximation. We find that these fluctuations produce additional logarithmic enhancements to the specific heat at low temperature, specifically $C\sim T (\log(1/T))^2$.

Title: Room temperature quantum metric effect in TbMn6Sn6
Authors: Weiyao Zhao, Kaijian Xing, Yufei Zhao, Lei Chen, Min Hong, Yuefeng Yin, Yang Liu, Khoa Dang Le, Jacob Gayles, Fang Tang, Yong Fang, Binghai Yan, Julie Karel
Abstract: Quantum geometry, including Berry curvature and the quantum metric, of the electronic Bloch bands has been studied via nonlinear responses in topological materials. Naturally, these material systems with intrinsic strong nonlinear responses also form the key component in nonlinear electronic devices. However, the previous reported quantum geometry effects are mainly observed at cryogenic temperatures, hindering their application in practical devices. Here we report the tuneable strong room-temperature second-harmonic transport response in a quantum magnet, TbMn6Sn6, which is governed by the quantum metric and can be tuned with applied magnetic fields. We show that around room temperature, which is close to the spontaneous spin-reorientation transition, the magnetic configurations, and therefore the related symmetry breaking phases, are easily controlled via magnetic fields. Our results also show that manipulation of the symmetries of the magnetic structure presents an effective route to tuneable quantum-geometry-based devices.

Title: Coherent Bunching of Anyons and their Dissociation in Interference Experiments
Authors: Bikash Ghosh, Maria Labendik, Vladimir Umansky, Moty Heiblum, David F. Mross
Abstract: Aharonov-Bohm (AB) interference of fractional quasiparticles in the quantum Hall Effect generally reveals their elementary charge ($e^*$)[1-15]. Recently, our interferometry experiments with several particle states reported flux periods of ${\Delta}{\Phi}=(e/e^*){\Phi}_0$ the flux quantum) at moderate temperatures[16]. Here, we report interference measurements of particle-hole conjugated states at filling factor ${\nu}=2/3, 3/5, 4/7$, revealing unexpected flux periodicities of ${\Delta}{\Phi}={\Phi}_0/{\nu}$. The measured shot noise Fano factor (F) of the partitioned quasiparticles in each of the interferometers quantum point contacts (QPCs), was found to be, $F={\nu}$[17], and not that of the elementary charge, $F=e^*/e$[18,19]. These observations point to interference of bunched (clustered) elementary quasiparticles as coherent pairs, triples, and quadruplets, respectively. A small metallic gate (top gate, TG), deposited in the center of the interferometer bulk, forming an antidot (or a dot) when charged, thus introducing local quasiparticles at the (anti)dots perimeter. Surprisingly, such charging led to a dissociation of the bunched quasiparticles and thus recovered the conventional flux periodicity set by the elementary quasiparticles charge. However, the shot noise Fano factor (of each QPC) consistently remained at $F={\nu}$, possibly due to the neutral modes accompanied the conjugated states. The two observations - bunching and debunching (or dissociation) - are not expected by current theories. Similar effects may likely arise in Jains particle states (at lower temperatures) and at even denominator FQH states[20]

Abstract: Supersymmetry (SUSY) proposed as an elementary symmetry for physics beyond the Standard Model has found important applications in various areas outside high-energy physics. Here, we systematically implement supersymmetric quantum mechanics -- exhibiting fundamental SUSY properties in the simple setting of quantum mechanics -- into a wide range of topological semimetals, where the broken translational symmetry, e.g., by a magnetic field, is effectively captured by a SUSY potential. We show that the dynamical SUSY breaking via the instanton effect over the SUSY potential valleys works as the underlying mechanism for the gap opening of the topological semimetallic phases, and the magnitude of the instanton effect is proportional to the energy gap. This instanton mechanism provides a simple criterion for determining whether the energy gap has been opened, without resorting to detailed calculations, i.e., a finite energy gap is opened if and only if the SUSY potential has an even number of zeros. Our theory leads to previously unexpected results: even an infinitesimal magnetic field can open a gap in topologically robust Dirac, Weyl, and nodal-line semimetallic phases due to the dynamical SUSY breaking. Overall, the revealed connection between SUSY quantum mechanics and non-uniform topological semimetals can elucidate previously ambiguous phenomena, provide guidance for future investigations, and open a new avenue for exploring topological semimetals.

Title: Magnetic switching of phonon angular momentum in a ferrimagnetic insulator
Authors: Fangliang Wu, Jing Zhou, Song Bao, Liangyue Li, Jinsheng Wen, Yuan Wan, Qi Zhang
Abstract: Circularly polarized phonons offer a new route for mediating angular momentum in solids. However, controlling phonon angular momentum without altering the material's structure or composition remains challenging. Here, we demonstrate the non-volatile switching of angular momentum-carrying phonons by leveraging intrinsic ferrimagnetism in an insulator. We find a pair of chiral phonons with giant energy splitting reaching 20% of the phonon frequency, due to spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. With a moderate magnetic field, the phonon angular momentum of the two chiral phonon branches can be switched along with the magnetization. Notably, near the critical temperature, the effective phonon magnetic moment is enhanced, reaching 2.62 Bohr magneton, exceeding the moment of a magnon. A microscopic model based on phonon-magnon coupling accounts for the observations. Furthermore, we identify two types of phononic domains with opposite phonon Zeeman splitting and propose the existence of topologically protected phononic edge modes at domain boundaries. These results demonstrate effective manipulation of chiral phonons with magnetism, and pave the way for engineering chiral phononic domains on the micrometer scale.

Title: Exact height distribution in one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface with diffusing diffusivity
Authors: David S. Dean, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study the height distribution of a one-dimensional Edwards-Wilkinson interface in the presence of a stochastic diffusivity $D(t)=B^2(t)$, where $B(t)$ represents a one-dimensional Brownian motion at time $t$. The height distribution at a fixed point is space is computed analytically. The typical height $h(x,t)$ at a given point in space is found to scale as $t^{3/4}$ and the distribution $G(H)$ of the scaled height $H=h/t^{3/4}$ is symmetric but with a nontrivial shape: while it approaches a nonzero constant quadratically as $H\to 0$, it has a non-Gaussian tail that decays exponentially for large $H$. We show that this exponential tail is rather robust and holds for a whole family of linear interface models parametrized by a dynamical exponent $z>1$, with $z=2$ corresponding to the Edwards-Wilkinson model.

Title: Brightening dark excitons and trions in systems with a Mexican-hat energy dispersion: example of InSe
Authors: Lewis J. Burke, Mark T. Greenaway, Joseph J. Betouras
Abstract: We investigate the properties of momentum-dark excitons and trions formed in two-dimensional (2D) materials that exhibit an inverted Mexican-hat-shaped dispersion relation, taking monolayer InSe as an example. We employ variational techniques to obtain the momentum-dark and bright ground-states (non-zero and zero quasiparticle momenta, respectively). These states are of particular interest due to their peaks in the quasiparticle density of states, the largest contribution comes from the momentum-dark ground state due to the presence of a van Hove singularity (VHS). These momentum-dark systems require a physical process to provide the necessary momentum to become bright. We study the brightening of this state due to coupling with phonons and compute the resulting photoluminescence spectrum. This work opens new avenues of research, such as exploiting dark excitons in solar cells and other semiconductor-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: Single-molecule phosphorescence and intersystem crossing in a coupled exciton-plasmon system
Authors: Abhishek Grewal, Hiroshi Imada, Kuniyuki Miwa, Miyabi Imai-Imada, Kensuke Kimura, Rafael Jaculbia, Klaus Kuhnke, Klaus Kern, Yousoo Kim
Abstract: Scanning the sharp metal tip of a scanning tunneling microscope (STM) over a molecule allows tuning the coupling between the tip plasmon and a molecular fluorescence emitter. This allows access to local variations of fluorescence field enhancement and wavelength shifts, which are central parameters for characterizing the plasmon-exciton coupling. Performing the same for phosphorescence with molecular scale resolution remains a significant challenge. In this study, we present the investigation of phosphorescence from isolated Pt-Phthalocyanine molecules by analyzing tip-enhanced emission spectra in both current-induced and laser-induced phosphorescence. The latter directly monitors singlet-to-triplet state intersystem crossing of a molecule below the tip. The study contributes to a detailed understanding of triplet excitation pathways and their potential control at sub-molecular length scales. Additionally, the coupling of organic phosphors to plasmonic structures is a promising route for improving light-emitting diodes.

Title: Statistical Uncertainties of Limit Cycle Systems in Langevin Bath
Authors: Dipesh K. Singh, P. K. Mohanty
Abstract: We show that limit cycle systems in Langevin bath exhibit uncertainty in observables that define the limit-cycle plane, and maintain a positive lower bound. The uncertainty-bound depends on the parameters that determine the shape and periodicity of the limit cycle. In one dimension, we use the framework of canonical dissipative systems to construct the limit cycle, whereas in two dimensions, particle in central potentials with radial dissipation provide us natural examples. We also investigate how uncertainties, which are absent in deterministic systems, increase with time when the systems are attached to a bath and eventually cross the lower bound before reaching the steady state.

Title: Engineering metal-insulator transitions in ultra-thin doped copper sulfides
Authors: Haiyang Chen, Yufeng Liu, Yashi Jiang, Changcang Qiao, Tao Zhang, Jianyang Ding, Zhengtai Liu, Zhenhua Chen, Yaobo Huang, Hengxin Tan, Jinfeng Jia, Shiyong Wang, Peng Chen
Abstract: Band structure is essential for understanding the electronic behavior of a material. The delicate engineering of the bands remains challenging because of the complex interplay of electronic, structural, and compositional factors. Here, we demonstrate the formation of distinct metallic and insulating ground states in ultra-thin copper sulfide films by effectively tuning the band structure via changing the composition of Cu and S in the system. Using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES), we observed a continuous band renormalization and opening of a full gap at low temperatures over a wide range of doping. The electronic origin of this metal-insulator transition is supported by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and low energy electron diffraction (LEED) measurements, which show no indication of superlattice modulation and lattice symmetry breaking. The evidence of excitonic insulating phase is further provided by carrier density dependent transitions, a combined effect of electron screening and Coulomb interaction strength. Our findings demonstrate the tunability of the band structure of copper sulfides, allowing for new opportunities to study exotic quantum phases.

Title: Chiral vortex-line liquid of three-dimensional interacting Bose systems with moat dispersion
Authors: Bahar Jafari-Zadeh, Chenan Wei, Tigran A. Sedrakyan
Abstract: We formulate and investigate a novel quantum state, the Chiral Vortex-Line Liquid (CVLL), emerging in three-dimensional interacting Bose systems exhibiting moat-band dispersions. Such dispersions feature extensive degeneracy along closed manifolds in momentum space, significantly amplifying quantum fluctuations that suppress conventional Bose-Einstein condensation. By extending the two-dimensional Chern-Simons (CS) flux-attachment transformation to three dimensions through a combination of planar CS phases and Jordan-Wigner fermionization along vortex lines, we construct the CVLL state, characterized by preserved rotational $SO(2)$ symmetry, broken time-reversal symmetry, nontrivial vortex-line excitations, and topological gapless edge surface states. We construct the associated field theory in a curved spatial geometry and analyze the low-energy effective theory of the CVLL state, demonstrating its topological nature. Using Monte Carlo simulations, we numerically determine the scaling of the chemical potential of the CVLL ground state as a function of boson density for interacting bosons in a cylindrical moat-band geometry and demonstrate that the CVLL phase energetically outcompetes traditional condensate phases at low densities, highlighting its relevance to experimental platforms including frustrated quantum magnets, ultracold atomic gases, excitonic systems, the physics of rotons in $^4$He, and moat regimes in heavy-ion collisions.

Title: High-Quality Ultra-Fast Total Scattering and Pair Distribution Function Data using an X-ray Free Electron Laser

Abstract: High-quality total scattering data, a key tool for understanding atomic-scale structure in disordered materials, require stable instrumentation and access to high momentum transfers. This is now routine at dedicated synchrotron instrumentation using high-energy X-ray beams, but it is very challenging to measure a total scattering dataset in less than a few microseconds. This limits their effectiveness for capturing structural changes that occur at the much faster timescales of atomic motion. Current X-ray free-electron lasers (XFELs) provide femtosecond-pulsed X-ray beams with maximum energies of approximately 24 keV, giving the potential to measure total scattering and the attendant pair distribution functions (PDFs) on femtosecond timescales. Here, we show that this potential has been realised using the HED scientific instrument at the European XFEL and present normalised total scattering data for 0.35 Å-1 < Q < 16.6 Å-1 and their PDFs from a broad spectrum of materials, including crystalline, nanocrystalline and amorphous solids, liquids, and clusters in solution. We analyse the data using a variety of methods, including Rietveld refinement, small-box PDF refinement, joint reciprocal-real space refinement, cluster refinement, and Debye scattering analysis. The resolution function of the setup is also characterised. We conclusively show that high-quality data can be obtained from a single approximately 30 fs XFEL pulse. Our efforts not only significantly increase the existing maximum reported Q-range for an S(Q) measured at an XFEL but also mean that XFELs are now a viable X-ray source for the broad community of people using reciprocal space total scattering and PDF methods in their research.

Title: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake
Authors: Sota Yoneda, Hiromitsu Takeuchi
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" Kármán vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.

Title: Interpolating between pair-potential systems
Authors: Lorenzo Costigliola, Andreas C. Martine, Claudia X. Romero, Jone E. Steinhoff, Francisco M. F. A. S. da Fonseca, Maria B. T. Nielsen, Jeppe C. Dyre
Abstract: This paper studies liquid-model systems with almost identical constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces. We simulated continuous interpolations between such systems, specifically between the Lennard-Jones (LJ), Weeks-Chandler-Andersen (WCA), exponent 12 inverse-power-law (IPL), and Yukawa (YK) pair-potential systems. Structure and dynamics were monitored via the radial distribution function and the time-dependent mean-square displacement, respectively. In terms of the interpolation parameter lambda, we argue that two systems have very similar constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces if the potential energies of configurations rarely cross when plotted as functions of lambda. Such absence of "level crossing" applies to a very good approximation for the LJ to WCA transformation, and it also applies to a quite good approximation for the LJ to IPL and the YK to YK transformations (the latter varies the screening length). In all cases, structure and dynamics are shown to be almost invariant as functions of lambda. The density is kept constant when lambda is varied. Temperature must generally be adjusted with lambda, which is done by an iterative "reduced-force-matching" method with no free parameters. We also apply the interpolation strategy to two versions of the Kob-Andersen (KA) binary LJ system and show that a recently introduced shifted-force-cutoff version of this system has constant-potential-energy hypersurfaces, which are almost identical to those of the original KA system. This result rationalizes the previously established fact that the two KA versions have virtually identical physics.

Title: Functional approach to superfluid stiffness: Role of quantum geometry in unconventional superconductivity
Authors: Maximilian Buthenhoff, Tobias Holder, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Non-trivial quantum geometry of electronic bands has been argued to facilitate superconductivity even for the case of flat dispersions where the conventional contribution to the superfluid weight is suppressed by the large effective mass. However, most previous work focused on the case of conventional superconductivity while many contemporary superconducting quantum materials are expected to host unconventional pairing. Here, we derive a generalized expression for the superfluid weight employing mean-field BCS theory for systems with time-reversal symmetry in the normal state and arbitrary unconventional superconducting order with zero-momentum intraband pairing. Our derivation reveals the necessity of incorporating functional derivatives of the grand potential with respect to the superconducting gap function. Through perturbative analysis in the isolated narrow-bands limit, we demonstrate that this contribution arises from quantum geometrical effects, specifically due to a non-trivial Wilczek-Zee connection. Utilizing the newly obtained expressions for the superfluid weight, we apply our framework to an extended Kane-Mele model, contrasting conventional $s$-wave superconductivity with chiral $d$-wave superconductivity.

Title: Exact multiple anomalous mobility edges in a flat band geometry
Authors: Zhanpeng Lu, Hui Liu, Yunbo Zhang, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: Anomalous mobility edges(AMEs), separating localized from multifractal critical states, represent a novel form of localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. However, quasi-periodic models exhibiting exact AMEs remain relatively rare, limiting the understanding of these transitions. In this work, we leverage the geometric structure of flat band models to construct exact AMEs. Specifically, we introduce an anti-symmetric diagonal quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, which consists of both quasi-periodic and constant potentials, into a cross-stitch flat band lattice. When the constant potential is zero, the system resides entirely in a localized phase, with its dispersion relation precisely determined. For non-zero constant potentials, we use a simple method to derive analytical solutions for a class of AMEs, providing exact results for both the AMEs and the system's localization and critical properties. Additionally, we propose a classical electrical circuit design to experimentally realize the system. This study offers valuable insights into the existence and characteristics of AMEs in quasi-periodic systems.

Title: Integral equation formulation of run-and-tumble particles in a harmonic trap: the special status of a system in two-dimensions
Authors: Derek Frydel
Abstract: Statistical-mechanical models often exhibit a dimension-dependent solvability: in 1D, exact solutions are straightforward; in 2D, solutions are exact but require nontrivial derivations; and in 3D, closed-form solutions are typically unavailable. This logic is repeated for a simple model of self-propelled particles, run-and-tumble particles (RTP) in a harmonic trap, confirming the claim that the system in 2D enjoys special status. This study revisits the RTP-harmonic-trap model using an integral-equation formulation recently proposed in Ref. \cite{POF-Frydel-2024}. The formulation is based on reinterpreting RTP motion as a jump process. The key quantity of the formulation is a transition operator $G(x,x')$, representing the probability distribution of the jumps of an auxiliary system. The stationary distribution is then obtained from the integral equation $\rho(x) = \int dx' \, \rho(x') G(x,x')$. In 2D, we find that $G(x,x')$ is reversible. This implies the $\rho(x)$ satisfied the detailed balance condition, $\rho(x') G(x,x') = \rho(x) G(x',x)$, from which $\rho(x)$ can be obtained without need of an integral equation. The reversibility of $G(x,x')$ does not mean that RTP particles are in equilibrium. It only means that our specific interpretation of the RTP motion leads to an auxiliary system that is in equilibrium. The reversibility of the system in 2D is lost if the probability distribution of the waiting times (the times that determine the duration on the "run" stage of the RTP motion) deviates from an exponential distribution.

Title: Topological Phase Transitions and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator
Authors: Lin Su, Rahul Sahay, Michal Szurek, Alexander Douglas, Ognjen Markovic, Ceren B. Dag, Ruben Verresen, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Topological phase transitions challenge conventional paradigms in many-body physics by separating phases that are locally indistinguishable yet globally distinct. Using a quantum simulator of interacting erbium atoms in an optical lattice, we observe such a transition between one-dimensional crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). We detect the critical point through non-local string order parameters and reveal its connection to the transition predicted between the Mott and Haldane insulators. Moreover, we demonstrate a striking property: stacking two identical systems eliminates the transition, confirming the predicted group structure and invertibility of SPTs. Finally, while introducing symmetry-breaking disorder also removes the transition, disorder averaging restores it. Consequently, the adjacent phases realize a form of mixed-state quantum order wherein the criticality between them depends on the observer's information. Our results demonstrate how topology and information influence quantum phase transitions, opening the doors to probing novel critical phenomena in programmable quantum matter.

Title: Stochastic elastohydrodynamics of contact and coarsening during membrane adhesion
Authors: Vira Dhaliwal, Jingbang Liu, Andreas Carlson
Abstract: Contact between fluctuating, fluid-lubricated soft surfaces is prevalent in engineering and biological systems, a process starting with adhesive contact, which can give rise to complex coarsening dynamics. One representation of such a system, which is relevant to biological membrane adhesion, is a fluctuating elastic interface covered by adhesive molecules that bind and unbind to a solid substrate across a narrow gap filled with a viscous fluid. This flow is described by the stochastic elastohydrodynamics thin-film equation, which combines the effects of viscous nanometric thin film flow, elastic membrane properties, adhesive springs, and thermal fluctuations. The average time it takes the fluctuating elastic membrane to adhere is predicted by the rare event theory, increasing exponentially with the square of the initial gap height. Numerical simulations reveal a phase separation of membrane domains driven by the binding and unbinding of adhesive molecules. The coarsening process displays close similarities to classical Ostwald ripening; however, the inclusion of hydrodynamics affects power-law growth. In particular, we identify a new bending-dominated coarsening regime, which is slower than the well-known tension-dominated case.

Title: Disorder and the Robustness of Superconductivity on the Flat Band
Authors: Si Min Chan, Benoît Grémaud, G. George Batrouni
Abstract: We study the interplay between on-site disorder and fermion pairing on the quasi one-dimensional flat band Creutz lattice. Both disorder and flat bands localize particles, but an attractive interaction results in pair formation and delocalization giving rise to superconductivity. In this work, we examine the attractive Hubbard model on the Creutz lattice to study the competition between these two effects and elucidate the properties of the superconducting phase and the localization quantum phase transition as the disorder strength is increased. Our main result is that flat band superconductivity is robust against disorder: The critical disorder strength, $W_c$, required to localize the fermion pairs and destroy superconductivity, is finite at any interaction strength, $U$, and is proportional to the superconducting weight, $D_s$, of the clean system. Using large scale density matrix renormalization group computations, we show that this transition is of the BKT form. In addition, even at very small interaction strength, the localization is not due to single fermion localization but to pair localization. For completeness, we briefly study this disorder-induced localization with mean field theory and show that $W_c$ can be accurately determined by using an appropriate scaling function.

Title: FeTaX2: A ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulator
Authors: Yadong Jiang, Huan Wang, Jing Wang
Abstract: We theoretically propose that the van der Waals layered ternary transition metal chalcogenide FeTaX$_2$ (X = S, Se, Te) is a new family of ferrimagnetic quantum anomalous Hall insulators with sizable bulk gap and Chern number C = -2. The magnetic ordering originates predominantly from the Fe atoms, where strong ferromagnetic exchange interactions between them induce magnetic moments on the Ta sites, yielding a collinear ferrimagnetic ground state. The large topological gap arises from the deep sd-type band inversion between spin-down Ta d$_{z^2}$ and d$_{xy}$ orbitals near the Fermi level-a mechanism unique to d-orbital systems. Remarkably, the Curie temperature of monolayer FeTaX$_2$ is predicted to significantly exceed that of monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. Furthermore, both the Curie temperature and topological gap scale positively with the spin orbit coupling strength of the $d$ electrons, suggesting a common physical origin. These findings, if realized experimentally, could open new avenues for the research and application of topological quantum physics.

Title: Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part I: equilibrium multifarious self-assembly
Authors: Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: Multifarious assembly models consider multiple structures assembled from a shared set of components, reflecting the efficient usage of components in biological self-assembly. These models are subject to a high-dimensional parameter space, with only a finite region of parameter space giving reliable self-assembly. Here we use a continuous-time Gillespie simulation method to study multifarious self-assembly and find that the region of parameter space in which reliable self-assembly can be achieved is smaller than what was obtained previously using a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation method. We explain this discrepancy through a detailed analysis of the stability of assembled structures against chimera formation. We find that our continuous-time simulations of multifarious self-assembly can expose this instability in large systems even at moderate simulation times. In contrast, discrete-time simulations are slow to show this instability, particularly for large system sizes. For the remaining state space we find good agreement between the predictions of continuous- and discrete-time simulations. We present physical arguments that can help us predict the state boundaries in the parameter space, and gain a deeper understanding of multifarious self-assembly.

Title: Continuous-time multifarious systems -- Part II: non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization
Authors: Jakob Metson, Saeed Osat, Ramin Golestanian
Abstract: In the context of self-assembly, where complex structures can be assembled from smaller units, it is desirable to devise strategies towards disassembly and reassembly processes that reuse the constituent parts. A non-reciprocal multifarious self-organization strategy has been recently introduced, and shown to have the capacity to exhibit this complex property. In this work, we study the model using continuous-time Gillespie simulations, and compare the results against discrete-time Monte Carlo simulations investigated previously. Furthermore, using the continuous-time simulations we explore important features in our system, namely, the nucleation time and interface growth velocity, which comprise the timescale of shape-shifting. We develop analytical calculations for the associated timescales and compare the results to those measured in simulations, allowing us to pin down the key mechanisms behind the observed timescales at different parameter values.

Title: Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality in optically induced lattices of exciton-polariton condensates
Authors: D. Novokreschenov, V. Neplokh, M. Misko, N. Starkova, T. Cookson, A. Kudlis, A. Nalitov, I. A. Shelykh, A. V. Kavokin, P. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We investigate space-time coherence in one-dimensional lattices of exciton-polariton condensates formed by fully reconfigurable non-resonant optical pumping. Starting from an open-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation with deterministic reservoir kinetics and stochastic condensate noise, we derive a discrete complex-field model that incorporates coherent tunnelling, reservoir-mediated dissipative coupling and gain-saturation non-linearity. Adiabatic elimination of fast density fluctuations reveals a wedge-shaped region in the complex hopping plane where the coarse-grained phase dynamics reduces to the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) equation. By computing high-resolution phase diagrams of the temporal and spatial scaling exponents we pinpoint the boundaries separating the KPZ domain from the Edwards-Wilkinson (EW) regime. Large-scale graphics processing unit (GPU) simulations of chains containing up to $N=2000$ condensates confirm these predictions: inside the wedge the exponents converge to $\beta_{N}=\textbf{0.329}(3)\!\approx\!1/3$ and $\chi_{N}=\textbf{0.504}(4)\!\approx\!1/2$, whereas outside it the dynamics moves away from KPZ and ultimately flows toward the EW fixed point, although finite system size and finite observation time may yield intermediate effective exponents. These results pave the way to the implementation of ultrafast KPZ-simulators based on one-dimensional arrays of exciton-polariton condensates.

Title: Poor Man's Majoranon in Two Quantum Dots Dressed by Superconducting Quasi-Excitations
Authors: Zhi-Lei Zhang, Guo-Jian Qiao, C. P. Sun
Abstract: In a hybrid system consisting of two quantum dots (QDs) coupled to a superconductor (SC), zero-bias peaks in the differential conductance spectrum have been reported as potential signatures of Majorana fermions (MFs). However, such signatures typically appear only at specific parameter values of the QDs--so-called `sweet spots'--and are referred to as the Poor Man's Majorana (PMM). To investigate whether these signatures can be conclusively attributed to genuine MFs emerging over a continuous parameter range, we present an alternative approach that microscopically incorporates the superconducting effects into the QDs, rather than simply attribute them into two phenomenological parameters of QDs. This forms the dressed Majorana fermions (DMFs), which can be viewed as superpositions of quasi-excitations from both the QDs and the SC. We show that DMFs can localize at one end of a one-dimensional SC and persist across a continuous parameter range, thereby enhancing the feasibility of experimental detection. Our results provide a more accurate description of the PMM in such hybrid systems and offer practical guidance for observing end-localized PMM modes in continuous one-dimensional SC.

Title: Electric field control of third-order nonlinear Hall effect
Authors: Jiaju Yang, Lujun Wei, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Wei Niu, Jiarui Chen, Jun Du, Yong Pu
Abstract: The third-order nonlinear Hall effect (NLHE) serves as a sensitive probe of energy band geometric property, providing a new paradigm for revealing the Berry curvature distribution and topological response of quantum materials. In the Weyl semimetal TaIrTe4, we report for the first time that the sign of the third-order NLHE reverses with decreasing temperature. Through scaling law analysis, we think that the third-order NLHE at high (T > 23 K) and low (T < 23 K) temperatures is dominated by Berry-connection polarizability (BCP) and impurity scattering, respectively. The third-order NLHE response strength can be effectively modulated by an additional applied in-plane constant electric field. At the high temperature region, the BCP reduction induced by the electric field leads to a decrease in the third-order NLHE response strength, while at the low temperature region, the electric field cause both BCP and impurity scattering effects to weaken, resulting in a more significant modulation of the third-order NLHE response strength. At 4 K and an electric field strength of 0.3 kV/cm, the modulated relative response strength could reach up to 65.3%. This work provides a new means to explore the third-order NLHE and a valuable reference for the development of novel electronic devices.

Title: Tensor formalism for predicting synaptic connections with ensemble modeling or optimization
Authors: Tirthabir Biswas, Tianzhi Lambus Li, Selimzhan Chalyshkan, Fumi Kubo, James E. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Theoretical neuroscientists often try to understand how the structure of a neural network relates to its function by focusing on structural features that would either follow from optimization or occur consistently across possible implementations. Both optimization theories and ensemble modeling approaches have repeatedly proven their worth, and it would simplify theory building considerably if predictions from both theory types could be derived and tested simultaneously. Here we show how tensor formalism from theoretical physics can be used to unify and solve many optimization and ensemble modeling approaches to predicting synaptic connectivity from neuronal responses. We specifically focus on analyzing the solution space of synaptic weights that allow a threshold-linear neural network to respond in a prescribed way to a limited number of input conditions. For optimization purposes, we compute the synaptic weight vector that minimizes an arbitrary quadratic loss function. For ensemble modeling, we identify synaptic weight features that occur consistently across all solutions bounded by an arbitrary ellipsoid. We derive a common solution to this suite of nonlinear problems by showing how each of them reduces to an equivalent linear problem that can be solved analytically. Although identifying the equivalent linear problem is nontrivial, our tensor formalism provides an elegant geometrical perspective that allows us to solve the problem approximately in an analytical way or exactly using numeric methods. The final algorithm is applicable to a wide range of interesting neuroscience problems, and the associated geometric insights may carry over to other scientific problems that require constrained optimization. We conclude by applying and testing our ensemble modeling framework to whole-brain recordings of larval zebrafish performing optomotor and optokinetic responses.

Title: Modeling Athermal Phonons in Novel Materials using the G4CMP Simulation Toolkit
Authors: Israel Hernandez, Ryan Linehan, Rakshya Khatiwada, Kester Anyang, Daniel Baxter, Grace Bratrud, Enectali Figueroa-Feliciano, Lauren Hsu, Mike Kelsey, Dylan Temples
Abstract: Understanding phonon and charge propagation in superconducting devices plays an important role in both performing low-threshold dark matter searches and limiting correlated errors in superconducting qubits. The Geant4 Condensed Matter Physics (G4CMP) package, originally developed for the Cryogenic Dark Matter Search (CDMS) experiment, models charge and phonon transport within silicon and germanium detectors and has been validated by experimental measurements of phonon caustics, mean charge-carrier drift velocities, and heat pulse propagation times. In this work, we present a concise framework for expanding the capabilities for phonon transport to a number of other novel substrate materials of interest to the dark matter and quantum computing communities, including sapphire (Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$), gallium arsenide (GaAs), lithium fluoride (LiF), calcium tungstate (CaWO$_{4}$), and calcium fluoride (CaF$_{2}$). We demonstrate the use of this framework in generating phonon transport properties of these materials and compare these properties with experimentally-determined values where available.

Title: A Gapless Phase with Haagerup Symmetry
Authors: Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: We construct a (1+1)d gapless theory which has Haagerup $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry. The construction relies on the recent exploration of the categorical Landau paradigm applied to fusion category symmetries. First, using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory, we construct all gapped phases with Haagerup symmetry. Extending this construction to gapless phases, we study the second order phase transition between gapped phases, and determine analytically a Haagerup-symmetric conformal field theory. This is given in terms of two copies of the three-state Potts model, on which we realise the full $\mathcal{H}_3$ symmetry action and determine the relevant deformations to the $\mathcal{H}_3$-symmetric gapped phases. This continuum analysis is corroborated by a lattice model construction of the gapped and gapless phases, using the anyon chain.

Title: Logarithmic operators in $c=0$ bulk CFTs
Authors: Yifei He
Abstract: We study Kac operators (e.g. energy operator) in percolation and self-avoiding walk bulk CFTs with central charge $c=0$. The proper normalizations of these operators can be deduced at generic $c$ by requiring the finiteness and reality of the three-point constants in cluster and loop model CFTs. At $c=0$, Kac operators become zero-norm states and the bottom fields of logarithmic multiplets, and comparison with $c<1$ Liouville CFT suggests the potential existence of arbitrarily high rank Jordan blocks. We give a generic construction of logarithmic operators based on Kac operators and focus on the rank-2 pair of the energy operator mixing with the hull operator. By taking the $c\to 0$ limit, we compute some of their conformal data and use this to investigate the operator algebra at $c=0$. Based on cluster decomposition, we find that, contrary to previous belief, the four-point correlation function of the bulk energy operator does not vanish at $c=0$, and a crucial role is played by its coupling to the rank-3 Jordan block associated with the second energy operator. This reveals the intriguing way zero-norm operators build long-range higher-point correlations through the intricate logarithmic structures in $c=0$ bulk CFTs.

Title: Analog model for Euclidean wormholes: Bose-Einstein condensate with dirty surfaces
Authors: Isaque P. de Freitas, Nami F. Svaiter, Gustavo O. Heymans
Abstract: We study a Bose-Einstein condensate under the effects of the non-condensate atomic cloud. We model the resulting linear interaction of the condensate with the atomic gas as a quenched disorder. Using the distributional zeta function method, we obtain a representation for the quenched free energy as a series of integral moments of the partition function. Assuming that the Bose-Einstein condensate is confined between two planar surfaces, we show that random surface fields generate non-local terms in the effective action. The non-local effects in this condensed matter system define an analog model of a Euclidean wormhole. The leading contribution of the non-local interactions to the Casimir pressure is obtained.

Title: Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States
Authors: Riccardo Rende, Luciano Loris Viteritti, Federico Becca, Antonello Scardicchio, Alessandro Laio, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: Foundation models are highly versatile neural-network architectures capable of processing different data types, such as text and images, and generalizing across various tasks like classification and generation. Inspired by this success, we propose Foundation Neural-Network Quantum States (FNQS) as an integrated paradigm for studying quantum many-body systems. FNQS leverage key principles of foundation models to define variational wave functions based on a single, versatile architecture that processes multimodal inputs, including spin configurations and Hamiltonian physical couplings. Unlike specialized architectures tailored for individual Hamiltonians, FNQS can generalize to physical Hamiltonians beyond those encountered during training, offering a unified framework adaptable to various quantum systems and tasks. FNQS enable the efficient estimation of quantities that are traditionally challenging or computationally intensive to calculate using conventional methods, particularly disorder-averaged observables. Furthermore, the fidelity susceptibility can be easily obtained to uncover quantum phase transitions without prior knowledge of order parameters. These pretrained models can be efficiently fine-tuned for specific quantum systems. The architectures trained in this paper are publicly available at this https URL, along with examples for implementing these neural networks in NetKet.

Then we compute the energy functions. We show that the energy functions are identified with those appearing in the tight binding model.

Title: Efficient Learning Implies Quantum Glassiness
Authors: Eric R. Anschuetz
Abstract: We show a surprising relation between quantum learning theory and algorithmic hardness. We demonstrate that finding near-ground states of certain sparse disordered quantum systems is average-case hard for "Lipschitz" quantum algorithms if there exists an efficient, local learning algorithm -- such as the classical shadows algorithm -- for estimating the energy of a state of the system. A corollary of our result is that many standard quantum algorithms fail to find near-ground states of these systems, including short-time Lindbladian dynamics, short-time quantum annealing, phase estimation, and shallow-depth variational quantum algorithms. To achieve this, we introduce a topological property of quantum systems that we call the quantum overlap gap property (QOGP). This property is only satisfied by systems with an efficient local learning algorithm for the energy. We prove that systems which exhibit this topological property in their low-energy space are intractable for quantum algorithms whose outputs are stable under perturbations to their inputs. We then prove that the QOGP is satisfied for a sparsified variant of the quantum $p$-spin model, giving the first known algorithmic hardness-of-approximation result for quantum algorithms in finding the ground state of a non-stoquastic, noncommuting quantum system. Our resulting lower bound for quantum algorithms optimizing this model using Lindbladian evolution matches the best-known time lower bound for classical Langevin dynamics optimizing classical $p$-spin models. For this reason we suspect that finding ground states of typical quantum $p$-spin models using quantum algorithms is, in practice, as intractable as the classical $p$-spin model is for classical algorithms. Inversely, we show that the Sachdev--Ye--Kitaev (SYK) model does not exhibit the QOGP, consistent with previous evidence that the model is rapidly mixing at low temperatures.

Title: Negative moment of inertia of large-$N_c$ gluons on a ring
Authors: Maxim Chernodub
Abstract: We study SU($N_c$) Yang-Mills theory in $1+1$ dimensions at finite temperature on a spatial ring that rotates uniformly in a plane. We show that the effect of rotation results only in a simple kinematic enhancement of the gauge coupling $g$, which becomes rescaled by a Lorentz factor corresponding to the tangential rotational velocity of the ring. Using well-established analytic results in Yang-Mills theory in the 't Hooft limit of an infinite number of colors, we demonstrate that the moment of inertia of the large-$N_c$ gluon plasma on the ring is negative. This counterintuitive conclusion is, however, in agreement with recent first-principle numerical simulations of hot $3+1$ dimensional SU(3) Yang-Mills theory that also reported a negative moment of inertia for gluon plasma in an experimentally relevant window of temperatures above the deconfinement transition. Furthermore, we argue that our picture provides a qualitative explanation for three other intriguing features observed in lattice simulations of vortical QCD: the emergence of a spatially inhomogeneous mixed phase, the inconsistency of its spatial structure with a standard picture dictated by the Tolman-Ehrenfest law, and the enhancement of the critical deconfining temperature by rotation.

Title: Engineering and harnessing long-range interactions for atomic quantum simulators
Authors: Javier Argüello-Luengo
Abstract: Interactions between quantum particles, such as electrons, are the source of important effects, ranging from superconductivity, to the formation of molecular bonds, or the stability of elementary compounds at high-energies. In this article, we illustrate how advances in the cold-atom community to further engineer such long-range interactions have stimulated the simulation of new regimes of these fundamental many-body problems. The goal is two-fold: first, to provide a comprehensive review of the different strategies proposed and/or experimentally realized to induce long-range interactions among atoms moving in optical potentials. Second, to showcase various fields where such platforms can offer new insights, ranging from the simulation of condensed matter phenomena to the study of lattice gauge theories, and the simulation of electronic configurations in chemistry. We then discuss the challenges and opportunities of these platforms compared to other complementary approaches based on digital simulation and quantum computation.

Title: A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation
Authors: Arthur Le Saux, Armand Leclerc, Guillaume Laibe, Pierre Delplace, Antoine Venaille
Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.

Title: Universal roughness and the dynamics of urban expansion
Authors: Ulysse Marquis, Oriol Artime, Riccardo Gallotti, Marc Barthelemy
Abstract: We present a new approach to quantify urban sprawl using tools from surface growth physics. Analyzing built-up area expansion in 19 cities (1985-2015), we uncover anisotropic growth with branch-like extensions and a piecewise linear relation between area and population. A universal local roughness exponent $\alpha_{\text{loc}} \approx 0.54$ coexists with variable exponents $\beta$, $z$. As modeling urban sprawl remains an open problem, these results offer a necessary empirical basis for theory.
