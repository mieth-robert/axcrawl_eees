Title: Steering Dynamical Regimes of Diffusion Models by Breaking Detailed Balance
Authors: Haiqi Lu, Ying Tang
Abstract: We show that deliberately breaking detailed balance in generative diffusion processes can accelerate the reverse process without changing the stationary distribution. Considering the Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process, we decompose the dynamics into a symmetric component and a non-reversible anti-symmetric component that generates rotational probability currents. We then construct an exponentially optimal non-reversible perturbation that improves the long-time relaxation rate while preserving the stationary target. We analyze how such non-reversible control reshapes the macroscopic dynamical regimes of the phase transitions recently identified in generative diffusion models. We derive a general criterion for the speciation time and show that suitable non-reversible perturbations can accelerate speciation. In contrast, the collapse transition is governed by a trace-controlled phase-space contraction mechanism that is fixed by the symmetric component, and the corresponding collapse time remains unchanged under anti-symmetric perturbations. Numerical experiments on Gaussian mixture models support these findings.

Title: A fully differentiable framework for training proxy Exchange Correlation Functionals for periodic systems
Authors: Rakshit Kumar Singh, Aryan Amit Barsainyan, Bharath Ramsundar
Abstract: Density Functional Theory (DFT) is widely used for first-principles simulations in chemistry and materials science, but its computational cost remains a key limitation for large systems. Motivated by recent advances in ML-based exchange-correlation (XC) functionals, this paper introduces a differentiable framework that integrates machine learning models into density functional theory (DFT) for solids and other periodic systems. The framework defines a clean API for neural network models that can act as drop in replacements for conventional exchange-correlation (XC) functionals and enables gradients to flow through the full self-consistent DFT workflow. The framework is implemented in Python using a PyTorch backend, making it fully differentiable and easy to use with standard deep learning tools. We integrate the implementation with the DeepChem library to promote the reuse of established models and to lower the barrier for experimentation. In initial benchmarks against established electronic structure packages (GPAW and PySCF), our models achieve relative errors on the order of 5-10%.

Title: Breaking of clustering and macroscopic coherence under the lens of asymmetry measures
Authors: Florent Ferro
Abstract: In one-dimensional systems, spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB) states are fragile by nature, as the injection of a non-zero energy density above the ground state is expected to restore the symmetry. This instability implies that local perturbations can lead to macroscopic correlation profiles, a breaking of clustering properties and even macroscopic quantum superpositions. In this work, we investigate the effect of interaction on this phenomenology by considering an interacting model with conserved domain wall number, that possesses a ferromagnetic ground state breaking the Z2 symmetry of the Hamiltonian. We first show that a local quench in this system amplifies quantum interferences, producing a macroscopic magnetisation profile that directly reflects the scattering phase of the model. Then, we use two asymmetry measures, namely the Entanglement Asymmetry (EA) and Quantum Fisher Information (QFI), to characterise the quantum coherence associated with the fluctuations of the magnetisation. By focusing on subsystems comparable in size to the light-cone of the perturbation, we confirm the emergence of macroscopic quantum coherence throughout the whole perturbed region. Finally, we discuss the link between EA and QFI and show that the variance/EA inequality for pure state can be generalised to a QFI/EA inequality for mixed states.

Title: Uniaxial stress enhanced anisotropic magnetoresistance and superconductivity in the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$
Authors: P. Král, V. Sazgari, Yongheng Ge, O. Gerguri, M. Spitaler, J.N. Graham, H. Nakamura, M. Bartkowiak, S. Nakatsuji, H. Luetkens, G. Simutis, Gang Xu, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: Elucidating the role of the kagome electronic structure in determining the various quantum ground states is of fundamental importance. In this work, we employ in-plane uniaxial stress as a tuning parameter to probe the electronic structure and its impact on the superconducting and normal-state properties of the kagome superconductor LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, combining magnetotransport measurements with first-principles calculations. We identify a pronounced anisotropy in both the upper critical field and the normal-state magnetoresistance, indicating strong electronic anisotropy despite the three-dimensional crystal structure. Furthermore, we find that the superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ increases under in-plane stress applied within the kagome plane, although the enhancement is modest, reaching approximately 0.3 K at 0.6 GPa. Furthermore, the absolute magnetoresistance exhibits a pronounced increase from about 22${\%}$ at zero stress to 35${\%}$ at 0.6 GPa, indicating a substantial modification of the normal state above $T_{\rm c}$. Previous studies have reported time-reversal-symmetry (TRS) breaking below a temperature scale that coincides with the onset of magnetoresistance. The simultaneous enhancement of both $T_{\rm c}$ and magnetoresistance under stress therefore suggests a positive correlation between superconductivity and normal-state electronic and magnetic properties in LaRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$. Detailed calculations demonstrate that stress-induced changes in $T_{\rm c}$ arise from the joint evolution of the total density of states and the flat band, whereas the large magnetoresistance enhancement is dominated by the stress-driven downward shift of the Ru $dz^{2}$ kagome flat band.

Title: Stochastic Modeling of Anisotropic Strength Surfaces from Atomistic Simulations
Authors: Alexander Bonacci, John Dolbow, Johann Guilleminot
Abstract: This work develops a unified framework for inferring, representing, and statistically characterizing an anisotropic strength surface directly from molecular dynamics data. Large-scale tensile loading simulations are used to generate failure data across all principal stress ratios and loading orientations, facilitated by a data-driven mapping between imposed strain-rate tensors and resulting stresses. The orientation-dependent strength surface is then represented using a constrained parametric formulation in which the surface parameters vary smoothly with loading angle through a low-dimensional functional encoding. To deploy the framework, we specifically consider the case of monocrystalline graphene, which is a prototypical two-dimensional material that has been extensively characterized, both experimentally and computationally, in the literature. For defective graphene, multiple random realizations of vacancy defect distributions are used to construct a stochastic ensemble of angular strength surfaces. Because each anisotropic strength surface requires substantial atomistic sampling to construct, the resulting ensemble is inherently limited in size, motivating the use of compact encoding, dimensionality reduction, and probabilistic modeling to characterize strength variability. Dimensionality reduction via Principal Component Analysis reveals a condensed latent representation of the fitted, encoded surfaces, where a Gaussian mixture model is employed to capture defect-induced variability, including rare outlier behaviors arising from clustered vacancy defects. Sampling from this probabilistic model enables the generation of new, physically admissible strength surfaces and the construction of confidence intervals in both parameter space and stress space.

Title: Zero Indirect Band Gap and Flat Bands in a Niobium Oxyiodide Cluster Material
Authors: Jan Beitlberger, Mario Martin, Marcus Scheele, Marek Matas, Carl P. Romao, Markus Ströbele, H.-Jürgen Meyer
Abstract: Explorative chemistry in a reaction system composed of NbI4, Li2(CN2), and Li2O has led to the discovery of a number of niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds. During this reaction, the formation of solid phases was detected alongside with gaseous phases, resulting in a range of products with cluster cores of varying shapes. After several niobium oxyiodide cluster compounds have already been identified within this reaction system, two additional compounds, Nb6O3I15 and Nb11O6I24, are discovered and structurally characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction. Both structures are based on the butterfly-shaped, oxygen-capped niobium cluster [Nb4O], which is extended to larger cluster fragments. The [Nb4O] cluster core in Nb6O3I15 is extended by two [NbO] units to form a three-dimensional framework, and Nb11O6I24 contains two connected [Nb4O] units, which form chiral units within an antiferrochiral hexagonal packing of strings. The striking string-like character of Nb11O6I24 was investigated in terms of its electronic structure and properties. DFT calculations showed Nb11O6I24 to possess a zero indirect band gap, with a pair of 3-dimensional flat bands surrounding the Fermi level. These unusual features of the electronic band structure suggest the presence of strongly correlated inter-cluster singlet electron states, arising from the helical shape of the clusters, the hexagonal packing of the strings, and the delocalized nature of cluster electron wavefunctions.

Title: Twist-induced Out-of-plane Ferroelectricity in Bilayer Hafnia
Authors: Jian Huang, Gwan Yeong Jung, Pravan Omprakash, Guodong Ren, Xin Li, Du Li, Xiaoshan Xu, Li Yang, Rohan Mishra
Abstract: Ferroelectric HfO2 is a promising candidate for next-generation memory devices due to its CMOS compatibility and ability to retain polarization at nanometer scales. However, the polar orthorhombic phase (Pca2_1) responsible for ferroelectricity is metastable and requires extrinsic stabilization, which makes it challenging for integration with silicon. We predict that bilayer 1T-HfO2 can exhibit robust and switchable out-of-plane (OOP) polarization arising from stacking-induced symmetry breaking. Using first-principles density functional theory, we predict that monolayer 1T-HfO2 can be cleaved from the (111) surface of cubic hafnia, and the monolayer is dynamically stable. When two aligned monolayers are twisted to form a moiré superlattice, it breaks the interlayer symmetry and allows the emergence of bistable OOP polarization. At a twist angle of 7.34o, the system exhibits a net polarization of ~16 {\mu}C/cm2. This sizeable polarization is due to the large polar displacements concentrated in AB stacking domains. Importantly, this polarization can be reversibly switched via interlayer sliding with a low energy barrier (~8 meV/formula unit) and comparable low coercive field (~0.2 V/nm), offering electric-field tunability. These findings establish twisted bilayer 1T-HfO2 as a scalable and robust 2D ferroelectric platform, enabling new pathways for integrating ferroelectric functionality into atomically thin memory and logic devices.

Title: Super Arrhenius temperature dependent viscosity due to liquid-liquid phase separation in the super-cooled Kob-Andersen model
Authors: Jayme Brickley, Xueyu Song
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a new order parameter called the weighted coordination number (WCN) to study the liquid-liquid (LL) phase separation, using the temperature-dependent coarsening of the LL interface as a possible mechanism for the glass transition. The well-established glass-forming Kob-Andersen binary Lennard-Jones system is used for our studies. The gas-liquid binodal line is reconstructed using the WCNs, and the same approach is extended to study the liquid-liquid binodal line. Systems of various densities are instantaneously quenched from high to low temperatures where a liquid-liquid separation is observed. Densities and the composition of each liquid state are used to check the level rule, along with density and pressure profiles, demonstrating local equilibrium of liquid-liquid phase separation. The transition from the liquid-liquid phase separation in the supercooled region to the glass transition region is modeled by adopting a Markov Network Model to estimate the temperature dependent viscosity using liquid-liquid interfacial information from the classification.

Title: Melting Coulomb clusters through nonreciprocity-enhanced parametric pumping
Authors: Zhicheng Shu, Wei-Chih Li, Wentao Yu, Justin C. Burton
Abstract: Complex systems out of equilibrium often experience intermittent oscillations between quiescent and highly dynamic states. The type of intermittency depends on how energy is pumped into the system, and how it is dissipated. While intermittency is usually driven by stochastic noise or external forcing, energy can also be sourced from field-mediated interactions between particles, which are often nonreciprocal and effectively violate Newton's 3rd law. Here we demonstrate how nonreciprocal interactions produce intermittency in clusters of charged micron-sized particles confined in a plasma sheath. Through three-dimensional particle tracking, we observe that vertical oscillations, induced by fluctuations of the plasma environment, can be parametrically coupled to the horizontal modes. Experiments and simulations show that nonreciprocal interactions strongly amplify this parametric coupling, creating a positive feedback loop that drives explosive growth of both the horizontal and vertical modes. This mechanism triggers abrupt melting transitions from an ordered cluster to an ergodic gas-like state, and leads to intermittent switching between states over long time scales. Overall, our work identifies nonreciprocal interactions as a key mechanism through which strongly coupled finite systems transform interaction-mediated activity into dynamical nonequilibrium states.

Title: Non-local physics-informed neural networks for forward and inverse solutions of granular flows
Authors: Saghar Zolfaghari, Safa Jamali
Abstract: Dense granular flows exhibit nonlocal effects due to stress transmission in microplastic events, especially in quasi-static or slowly sheared regions. Hence, traditional local rheological models fail to capture spatial cooperativity effects that are prominent in many granular systems. The nonlocal granular fluidity (NGF) model addresses this limitation by introducing a diffusive-like partial differential equation for a fluidity field, governed by a key material-dependent parameter: the nonlocal amplitude A. However, determining A from experiments or simulations is known to be difficult and typically requires extensive calibration across multiple geometries. In this work, we present a data-driven platform based on Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) embedded with the NGF model, capable of solving granular flows in a forward or inverse manner. We show that once trained on transient flow fields, these non-local PINNs can readily infer the material parameters, as well as the pressure and stress fields. These data-driven frameworks allow for accurate recovery of small variations in the nonlocal amplitude, A, which lead to sharp bifurcation-like transitions in the flow field. This approach demonstrates the feasibility of data-driven parameter inference in complex nonlocal models and opens up new possibilities for characterizing granular materials from sparse experimental observations.

Title: Ligand Mediated Magnetoelectronic Coupling Across Metamagnetic Transitions in CrPS4
Authors: Giuseppe Buccoliero, Rachel Nickel, Roberto Sant, Marli dos Reis Cantarino, Andrei Rogalev, Nathan J. Yutronkie, Tristan Riccardi, Daniel A. Chaney, Kurt Kummer, Johann Coraux, Nicholas B. Brookes
Abstract: Chromium thiophosphate is a long-known material: a layered semiconducting antiferromagnet. Its recently discovered gate-tunable metamagnetic phase transitions, the remarkable positive and oscillating magnetoresistance as a tunnel barrier, and its Fano-resonance luminescence, elusive among the multitude of Cr3+ compounds, call for revisiting the understanding of its electronic structure, especially regarding how it relates to magnetic order. Here, we employ X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, implemented in both absorption and resonant inelastic X-ray spectroscopies, together with quantum many-body calculations, to unveil the complex nature of magnetoelectronic coupling in CrPS4, featuring hybridization between crystal-field and charge-transfer transitions. We reveal the role of extended superexchange paths involving P and S atoms, mediating interactions between the Cr spins across the different magnetic phases: antiferromagnetic, canted, and ferromagnetic. Our results elucidate the electronic states involved in these phases and provide prescriptions for engineering the metamagnetic phase diagram of CrPS4.

Title: Evaporation-Induced Pattern Formation and Wetting in Active Microtubule-Kinesin Droplets
Authors: Vahid Nasirimarekani, Mehrana R. Nejad, Olinka Ramírez-Soto, Susan Ali, Stefan Karpitschka, L. Mahadevan, Isabella Guido
Abstract: Active networks composed of biopolymers and motor proteins provide versatile biomimetic systems that have advanced active matter physics and deepened our understanding of cytoskeletal dynamics and self-organization under diverse stimuli. In these systems, activity arises in aqueous solutions where motor proteins cross-link biopolymers and generate active stress driving the emergent network behavior. Here, we establish the active network in the form of a sessile, multi-component droplet on a substrate and investigate how evaporation influences its dynamics. We focus on how mass loss and compositional changes in the droplet reshape the behavior of the active suspension. We show that capillary and Marangoni flows drive the self-organization of microtubules into a distinctive radial arrangement within the droplet. The cross-linking ability of motor proteins gives rise to a striking non-monotonic wetting behavior, where the extensile stresses generated by the motor proteins strongly affect the characteristic timescale of the contact-line retracting and subsequent expansion. Using a combined experimental and theoretical approach, we demonstrate the crucial role of crosslinking in evaporating microtubule networks, and explain how active stresses together with evaporation-induced flows govern the dynamics of reconstituted microtubule systems and their wetting behavior. Evaporating droplets have recently attracted significant attention in the scientific community, and the findings of the setup presented in this study can have broad implications, ranging from self-organization and mechanical pattern formation in biological systems to questions about the origin of life.

Title: Enhanced Graphene-Water Thermal Transport via Edge Functionalization without Compromising In-Plane Thermal Conductivity
Authors: John Crosby (1), Haoran Cui (1), Mehrab Lotfpour (1), Yan Wang (1), Lei Cao (1) ((1) Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Nevada, Reno)
Abstract: Interfacial thermal transport between graphene and water plays a critical role in a wide range of thermal and energy applications. Although chemical functionalization can significantly enhance graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance, it often degrades graphene's intrinsic in-plane phonon transport. In this work, we perform a systematic deep neural network molecular dynamics study comparing edge-functionalized graphene nanoribbons with surface-functionalized graphene in aqueous environments. We demonstrate that functionalizing only 10% of the ribbon edges with hydroxyl groups increases the graphene-water interfacial thermal conductance by more than eightfold, primarily due to strengthened interfacial interactions and improved wettability at the edges. In contrast to basal-plane oxidation, edge functionalization largely preserves in-plane thermal conductivity. Importantly, hydroxyl edge groups exert competing effects on phonon transport: they introduce additional boundary scattering that suppresses heat conduction, while simultaneously passivating dangling bonds at bare edges, thereby reducing phonon localization and edge-induced scattering. This competition leads to a non-monotonic dependence of in-plane thermal conductivity on edge functionalization ratio. These results establish edge functionalization as an effective strategy for enhancing graphene-water interfacial thermal transport without sacrificing intrinsic phonon transport properties.

Title: Generative Inverse Estimation of 3D Atomic Coordination from Near-Edge Spectra via Equivariant Diffusion Models
Authors: Ren Okubo, Yu Fujikata, Izumi Takahara, Teruyasu Mizoguchi
Abstract: Extracting 3D atomic coordinates from spectroscopic data is a longstanding inverse problem. We present an equivariant diffusion model that generates site-specific 3D structures directly from near-edge spectra (ELNES/XANES). Trained on Si-O crystals, the model achieves radial accuracy comparable to Extended X-ray Absorption Fine Structure (EXAFS) (RMSD ~0.06 Å) but with superior coordination number precision (errors < 4.3% vs. EXAFS ~20%). Crucially, it reconstructs full 3D geometries including bond angles, overcoming the limitations of 1D radial distribution analysis. The model demonstrates robust out-of-distribution generalization, accurately predicting local structures in amorphous systems despite being trained exclusively on crystalline lattices. Application to experimental O K-edge spectra from {\alpha}-quartz validates practical applicability. This generative approach outperforms template matching and establishes automated, quantitative 3D structure determination from spectroscopic data.

Title: Dislocation-ledge coupling drives non-conservative migration of semicoherent precipitate interfaces
Authors: Jin-Yu Zhang, Juan Du, Lin Yang, Frédéric Mompiou, Shigenobu Ogata, Wen-Zheng Zhang
Abstract: Precipitate shape and size control the strength and stability of many structural alloys, yet the microscopic mechanism by which semicoherent precipitate interfaces migrate remains unclear. In particular, how dense interfacial dislocation networks move while accommodating transformation strain has resisted direct, time-resolved characterization. Here, we show that non-conservative motion of interfacial dislocations is intrinsically coupled to the nucleation and lateral propagation of nanoscale growth ledges, providing a defect-based kinetic description of lath growth. Phase-field-crystal simulations of a prototypical face-centered cubic/body-centered cubic (FCC/BCC) transformation resolve strongly anisotropic interface kinetics: the end face advances continuously along the lath long axis, whereas facets thicken by discrete ledge sweeps accompanied by mixed glide-climb reactions in a closed dislocation network. Crystallographic analyses predict the dislocation arrangements, rationalize the anisotropy via the geometry of misfit localization, and show how dislocation motion accommodates the transformation strain. In situ transmission electron microscopy of austenite precipitates in duplex stainless steel captures rapid ledge propagation on habit planes, consistent with the predicted migration mode. Our results bridge point-defect transport, dislocation reactions, and interface mobility, enabling quantitative, transferable predictions of precipitate morphology evolution.

Title: Negative Strain-Rate Sensitivity in Metallic Glasses Driven by Rejuvenation-Relaxation Competition: Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations and a Minimal Effective Model
Authors: Tomoaki Niiyama, Akio Ishii, Takahiro Hatano, Tomotsugu Shimokawa, Shigenobu Ogata
Abstract: When strain-rate sensitivity (SRS) is negative in metallic glasses, the material becomes weaker as the deformation rate increases, leading to accelerated plastic deformation and, eventually, catastrophic fracture. In this study, we elucidate the mechanism underlying the negative SRS using micromechanics-based kinetic Monte Carlo simulations that couple heterogeneous randomized shear transformation zone (STZ) models for metallic glasses. The model accounted for both the thermomechanical structural rejuvenation and relaxation of the energy barrier for thermal activation of STZs, incorporating a Kohlrausch-Williams-Watts (KWW)-type relaxation function. The present simulations systematically reproduce the dependence of flow stresses on strain rate, temperature, and the form of the relaxation function. The SRS tends to decrease at high strain rates and low temperatures in the simulations, and negative SRS appears when a compressed-exponential relaxation function is employed. Shear localization also appears; however, the conditions under which the observed localization emerges do not fully coincide with those leading to the negative SRS, leaving the dominant factor unclear. To clarify the dominant factor, we introduce a simplified theoretical model that reproduces flow stresses consistent with the simulation results. An analytical expression derived from the theoretical model reveals that negative SRS originates primarily from the temporal evolution of the activation barrier. Specifically, negative SRS arises when the timescale of external loading exceeds that of STZ relaxation.

Title: Stack of correlated insulating states in bilayer graphene kagome superlattice
Authors: Xinyu Cai, Fengfan Ren, Qiao Li, Yanran Shi, Yifan Wang, Yifan Zhang, Zhenghang Zhi, Jiawei Luo, Yulin Chen, Jianpeng Liu, Xufeng Kou, Zhongkai Liu
Abstract: Graphene-based systems have emerged as a rich platform for exploring emergent quantum phenomena-including superconductivity, magnetism, and correlated insulating behavior-arising from flat electronic bands that enhance many-body interactions. Realizing such flat bands has thus far relied primarily on moiré graphene superlattices or rhombohedral stacking graphene systems, both of which face challenges in reproducibility and tunability. Here, we introduce an artificial Kagome superlattice in bilayer graphene, engineered via nanopatterning of the dielectric substrate to create a precisely defined and electrostatically tunable periodic potential. Magnetotransport measurements reveal the emergence of a stack of correlated insulating states at moderate superlattice potentials, characteristic of strong electron-electron interactions within Kagome-induced flat bands. As temperature increases, these correlated gaps collapse, signaling the thermal suppression of interaction-driven states. Continuum-model calculations confirm the formation of multiple flat minibands and reproduce the observed evolution of band reconstruction. Our results establish dielectric-patterned graphene superlattices as a robust and controllable architecture for realizing flat-band-induced correlated phenomena beyond moiré systems.

Title: Coexistence of Rashba and Ising Spin-Singlet Pairings in Two-Dimensional IrTe$_{2}$
Authors: Kunal Dutta, Rajesh O. Sharma, Shreya Das, Indra Dasgupta, Tanmoy Das, Tanusri Saha-Dasgupta
Abstract: Symmetry offers a useful approach to unfold the intertwined degrees of freedom. Thus it paves the way to resolve coexisting quantum orders into distinct symmetry sectors. Motivated by the recent observation of superconductivity in nano-flaked IrTe$_2$, we investigate the superconductivity in strain-stabilized two-dimensional (2D) limit of IrTe$_2$ by combining density-functional theory with mean-field solution of spin-fluctuation mediated pairing interaction on a symmetry-constrained ${\bf k}\cdot{\bf p}$ model. The spin-orbit coupled band structure shows $\Gamma$-centred Fermi sheets with coexistence of band-selective Rashba-like (in-plane) and Ising-like (out-of-plane) superconductivity. Remarkably, the superconducting gaps are odd in spin, orbital, and momentum channels despite the presence of global inversion symmetry. Fermi surface topologies and little-group symmetry enforce distinct irreducible representations to the Rashba and Ising channels, forbidding their mixing. Our findings open up a symmetry-based route to multichannel superconductivity in 2D transition-metal dichalcogenides with unique functionalities.

Title: Decoherence of Josephson coupling and thermal quenching of the Josephson diode effect in bilayer superconductors
Authors: F. Yang, C. Y. Dong, Joshua A. Robinson, L. Q. Chen
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on superconducting (SC) diode nonreciprocity, we uncover an unexpected hierarchy of SC-phase decoherence in bilayer superconductors hosting both interlayer Josephson coupling and a Josephson diode effect. Contrary to the conventional single-energy-scale paradigm where Josephson coherence and diode nonreciprocity vanish simultaneously at the SC gap-closing temperature, we demonstrate, using a self-consistent microscopic theory incorporating phase fluctuations, that the system undergoes a sequence of distinct thermal crossovers upon heating: the diode effect disappears first at $T_{\eta}$, Josephson coherence is subsequently lost at $T_c$, and the SC gap collapses only at a higher temperature $T_s$. Rather than a direct SC-normal transition, the system thus evolves through successive nonreciprocal, reciprocal, and incoherent Josephson regimes before entering the normal state. Counterintuitively, the separation between these regimes is governed not only by interlayer coupling, but also sensitively by in-plane disorder and carrier density. These findings point to a generic hierarchy of SC decoherence in low-dimensional Josephson systems, and suggest broader relevance to layered superconductors, including cuprates and recently discovered nickelates, as well as to SC qubits.

Title: Unveiling and quantifying the topology-dependent pre-melting of nanoparticles
Authors: Marthe Bideault, Arnaud Allera, Ryoji Asahi, Jérôme Creuze, Erich Wimmer
Abstract: The melting of metallic nanoparticles is governed by surface pre-melting, a phenomenon traditionally modeled as the isotropic growth of a uniform liquid shell. Challenging this classical view, we report facet-dependent surface pre-melting in hexagonal close-packed Co nanoparticles, arising from the structural heterogeneity of the nanoparticle surface. Characterizing melting in molecular dynamics simulations (500 to 6000 atoms), we observe the onset of surface mobility, starting as low as $0.2\times T_{M,\infty}$ (the bulk melting point), driven by the early disordering of stepped $\{01\bar{1}1\}$ facets. We found that these facets consistently melt at temperatures nearly 200 Kelvin lower than flat $\{0001\}$ facets, regardless of particle size, and relate facets melting temperatures to the nanoparticle size via a 2D extension of the Gibbs-Thomson relation. We determine a critical liquid layer thickness that triggers the melting of the entire nanoparticle, which is found to be size-dependent. Our results confirm the recent experimental observation of the surface pre-melting effect, and extend it to anisotropic particles with different facet orientations.

Title: Stripe antiferromagnetism in van der Waals metal HoTe3 decoupled from charge density wave order

Abstract: The $R\mathrm{Te}_3$ ($R = \text{rare earth}$) family of layered van der Waals (vdW) compounds hosts coexisting magnetic and charge density wave (CDW) orders, yet the interplay between these degrees of freedom remains little explored. Combining polarized and unpolarized neutron diffraction on single-crystal $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$, we identify two distinct antiferromagnetic (AFM) phases, both exhibiting a collinear $\uparrow\uparrow\downarrow\downarrow$ motif within individual vdW layers. The two phases are distinguished by the vdW stacking of magnetic layers: ferromagnetic (FM) stacking in the higher-temperature AFM-II phase, here termed ``vertical-stripe'', and AFM stacking in the AFM-I ground state, here termed ``tilted-stripe''; the two phases have propagation vectors $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m2}} = (0.48, 0, 0)$ and $\boldsymbol{q}_{\mathrm{m1}} = (0.5, 0.5, 0)$, respectively. In contrast to the CDW-driven exotic magnetism in $\mathrm{DyTe}_3$, $\mathrm{TbTe}_3$, and $\mathrm{GdTe}_3$, we find no evidence for coupling between magnetism and CDW in $\mathrm{HoTe}_3$. The relative alignment between AFM and CDW propagation vectors, as well as single-ion anisotropy, are likely essential for generating coupled spin/charge orders in layered vdW systems.

Title: Liouvillian interpolation of the self-energy of cluster dynamical mean-field theories
Authors: Mathias Pelz, Jan von Delft, Andreas Gleis
Abstract: Two widely-used non-local extensions of dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), cellular DMFT (CDMFT) and the dynamical cluster approximation (DCA), both yield self-energies marred by having some unphysical properties: CDMFT yields real-space self-energies that are not translationally invariant, and DCA yields momentum-space self-energies with discontinuities in their momentum dependence. It is often desirable to remove these flaws by post-processing cluster DMFT results, using strategies called periodization for CDMFT and interpolation for DCA -- for brevity, we refer to both cases as interpolation. However, traditional interpolation approaches struggle to capture intricate structures such as hole pockets in the hole-doped square-lattice Hubbard model, as highlighted in Phys. Rev. B 105, 35117 (2022). Further, these approaches interpolate frequency-dependent functions, which may lead to causality violations. Here, we propose Liouvillian interpolation, a novel, intuitive, and robust scheme for interpolating cluster DMFT results. Our key idea is to interpolate frequency-independent matrix elements of the single-particle irreducible part of the Liouvillian, obtained from a continued-fraction expansion of the cDMFT self-energy. We demonstrate that the ingredients of such an expansion possess a more local Fourier expansion than the functions involved in traditional interpolation schemes, and that Liouvillian interpolation inherently conserves causality. We illustrate our method for the one-dimensional Hubbard model using CDMFT, and for the two-dimensional Hubbard model using four-patch DCA. For the latter, we find that L-interpolation can (depending on doping) yield Fermi and Luttinger arcs which together form a closed surface.

Title: AI-Driven Structure Refinement of X-ray Diffraction
Authors: Bin Cao, Qian Zhang, Zhenjie Feng, Taolue Zhang, Jiaqiang Huang, Lu-Tao Weng, Tong-Yi Zhang
Abstract: Artificial intelligence can rapidly propose candidate phases and structures from X-ray diffraction (XRD), but these hypotheses often fail in downstream refinement because peak intensities cannot be stably assigned under severe overlap and diffraction consistency is enforced only weakly. Here we introduce WPEM, a physics-constrained whole-pattern decomposition and refinement workflow that turns Bragg's law into an explicit constraint within a batch expectation--maximization framework. WPEM models the full profile as a probabilistic mixture density and iteratively infers component-resolved intensities while keeping peak centres Bragg-consistent, producing a continuous, physically admissible intensity representation that remains stable in heavily overlapped regions and in the presence of mixed radiation or multiple phases. We benchmark WPEM on standard reference patterns (\ce{PbSO4} and \ce{Tb2BaCoO5}), where it yields lower $R_{\mathrm{p}}$/$R_{\mathrm{wp}}$ than widely used packages (FullProf and TOPAS) under matched refinement conditions. We further demonstrate generality across realistic experimental scenarios, including phase-resolved decomposition of a multiphase Ti--15Nb thin film, quantitative recovery of \ce{NaCl}--\ce{Li2CO3} mixture compositions, separation of crystalline peaks from amorphous halos in semicrystalline polymers, high-throughput operando lattice tracking in layered cathodes, automated refinement of a compositionally disordered Ru--Mn oxide solid solution (CCDC 2530452), and quantitative phase-resolved deciphering of an ancient Egyptian make-up sample from synchrotron powder XRD. By providing Bragg-consistent, uncertainty-aware intensity partitioning as a refinement-ready interface, WPEM closes the gap between AI-generated hypotheses and diffraction-admissible structure refinement on challenging XRD data.

Title: Photophysical properties of Eu3+ complexes approaching electronic contact to a metal surface
Authors: Adrian Ebert, Simon Fromme, Lisa Burgert, Umar Rashid, Lukas Gerhard, Julia Feye, Senthil Kumar Kuppusamy, Barbora Brachnakova, Timo Neumann, Mario Ruben, Peter W. Roesky, Michael Seitz, Wulf Wulfhekel
Abstract: The application of rare-earth complexes in electrically driven light sources poses a series of challenges that require specific optimization of the molecular photophysical properties. Here, we present a report on films of three different Eu3+ complexes characterized in terms of emission spectra and fluorescence decay. We compare molecular complexes in powder form and sublimed films, in films on glass and on a metal surface, and in films of thicknesses down to less than 3 nm (< 3 ML), approaching electrical coupling. Our photoluminescence experiments supported by scanning tunneling microscopy of sub-monolayers indicate that Eu3+(trensal) complexes are less affected by sublimation and more stable on the metal surface than typical beta diketonate complexes, making them promising candidates for electroluminescence devices.

Title: Hidden universality in dislocation-loops mediated three-dimensional crystal melting
Authors: Alessio Zaccone, Konrad Samwer
Abstract: Understanding why and how crystalline solids melt remains a central problem in condensed-matter physics. Dislocation loops are fundamental topological excitations that control the thermodynamic stability of crystals, yet their role in setting universal aspects of melting has remained unclear. Here we show, within dislocation-mediated melting theory, that the free-energy condition for loop proliferation leads to a universal ratio between the energy of a minimal dislocation loop and the thermal energy at melting. For minimal dislocation loops that begin to proliferate at the onset of melting, this ratio takes the purely geometric value $\mathcal{E}_* = E_{\rm loop}/(k_B T_m) \approx 25.1$, independent of elastic moduli and chemistry-dependent details. This result provides a microscopic explanation for recent empirical findings by Lunkenheimer \emph{et al.}, who identified a closely related universal energy scale $\approx 24.6$ from viscosity data. The same framework also rationalizes the empirical $2/3$ rule relating the glass-transition and melting temperatures.

Title: Computation of thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo methods
Authors: Vladislav Efremkin, Stefano Mossa, Jean-Louis Barrat, Markus Holzmann
Abstract: The calculation of thermal conductivity in insulating solids at temperatures below the Debye temperature is problematic, due to the breakdown of classical and semi-classical approaches. In this work, we present a fully quantum methodology to compute thermal conductivity based on Path Integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) simulations combined with the Green-Kubo linear response theory. The method is applied to crystalline argon modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential, a paradigmatic system where quantum effects strongly affect both thermodynamic and transport properties. From PIMC simulations, we obtain the temperature-dependent phonon frequencies, lifetimes, and specific heat. From the imaginary time correlations of the energy current, we extract the thermal transport coefficients based on a physically motivated prior. We show that the experimentally observed increase of the thermal conductivity at low temperatures cannot be explained within a standard Peierls-Boltzmann framework or quasi-harmonic approximation using phonon lifetimes alone. Instead, a distinct transport lifetime emerges from the analysis of heat-current correlations. Our results demonstrate that quantum Monte Carlo methods provide a robust, non-perturbative framework to investigate heat transport in insulating solids, beyond the limits of classical molecular dynamics and quasi-harmonic approximations.

Title: Three dimensional contractile droplet under confinement
Authors: Adriano Tiribocchi, Marco Lauricella, Andrea Montessori, Sauro Succi
Abstract: We numerically study the dynamics of a three-dimensional contractile fluid droplet in the bulk and under confinement. We show that varying activity leads to a variety of shapes and motile regimes whose motion is driven by an interplay between spontaneous flows and elasticity. In the bulk the droplet self-propels unidirectionally, acquiring either an almost spherical shape at intermediate activity or a peanut-like geometry for larger values. Under confinement, the droplet exhibits a previously unreported oscillating dynamics characterized by periodic hits against opposite walls of a microchannel while moving forward. These results could be of interest for the study of artificial microswimmers and their biological analogs, such as living cells.

Title: Transition between one- and two-dimensional topology in a Chern insulator of finite width
Authors: Frode Balling-Ansø, Adipta Pal, Ashley M. Cook, Anne E. B. Nielsen
Abstract: Topology in quantum systems is typically considered in infinite crystals in one, two, or higher integer dimensions. Here, we show that one can continuously transform a system between a topological phase associated with one dimension and a topological phase associated with two dimensions without closing the energy gap. In this process, the dimension of the system itself changes. Concretely, we investigate a modified version of the Qi-Wu-Zhang model and develop a procedure to smoothly shrink the width of the system in one direction. By tracking gaps which remain open throughout the modulation, we establish a smooth transition from a two-dimensional to a one-dimensional topological insulator. In between the system exhibits both one- and two-dimensional topology, and the way the system accomplishes the transition is by making the one-dimensional topology more robust as the width decreases, while the two-dimensional topology becomes less robust. Finally, we show how the gaps arise from hybridization of edge states due to the finite width.

Title: Confinement Epitaxy of Large-Area Two-Dimensional Sn at the Graphene/SiC Interface
Authors: Zamin Mamiyev, Niclas Tilgner, Narmina O. Balayeva, Dietrich R.T. Zahn, Thomas Seyller, Christoph Tegenkamp
Abstract: Confinement epitaxy beneath graphene stabilizes exotic material phases by restricting vertical growth and altering lateral diffusion, conditions unattainable on bare substrates. However, achieving long-range interfacial order while maintaining high-quality graphene remains a significant challenge. Here, we demonstrate the synthesis of large-area quasi-free-standing monolayer graphene (QFMLG) via the intercalation of a two-dimensional (2D) Sn. While the triangular Sn(1x1) interface exhibits a robust metallic band structure, the decoupled QFMLG maintains charge neutrality, confirmed by photoemission spectroscopy. Using high-resolution Raman spectroscopy and microscopy, we distinguish between direct intercalation and diffusion-driven expansion, identifying the latter as the critical pathway to superior QFMLG crystalline quality. Temperature-dependent analysis reveals dynamical structural coupling between the decoupled QFMLG and the Sn interface, providing a novel degree of freedom for strain engineering. Beyond uncovering the diffusion-driven mechanism, this work establishes metal intercalation as an effective strategy for tailoring durable graphene-metal heterostructures with tunable properties for next-generation quantum materials platforms.

Title: Monte Carlo study of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice
Authors: A.N. Ignatenko, S.V. Streltsov, V.Yu. Irkhin
Abstract: An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |\theta|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $\theta$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.

Title: When Is Structural Lubricity Load Independent? The Role of Contact Geometry and Elastic Compliance
Authors: Hongyu Gao
Abstract: Using molecular dynamics simulations of an incommensurate Au(111)/graphite interface, we investigate the conditions under which structural lubricity produces load-independent friction. We show that strict load independence occurs only in laterally infinite, area-filling contacts, where dissipation is governed by phonon-mediated viscous coupling and the shear stress scales linearly with sliding velocity. Finite contacts with explicit boundary terminations exhibit substantially higher friction yet remain load independent up to a critical load. Load dependence arises only when elastic out-of-plane deformation near the contact line exceeds a critical amplitude, activating additional dissipation channels. These results demonstrate that contact geometry and local elastic compliance, rather than normal load itself, determine the onset and breakdown of load-independent structural lubricity.

Title: Emergent Topological Complexity in the Barabasi-Albert Model with Higher-Order Interactions
Authors: Vadood Adami, Hosein Masoomy, Mirko Luković, Morteza Nattagh Najafi
Abstract: We examine the homological structure of the Barabasi-Albert model, focusing on the time evolution of $\Delta$-dimensional simplices and topological holes as functions of time $t$ and the attachment parameter $m$ (the number of edges added by each incoming node). Numerical simulations reveal a non-trivial topological transition (TT) in the $(\Delta, m)$ plane, marking a change from a topologically trivial regime to non-trivial topology. This transition signals the emergence of topological complexity in the model, where higher-order structures develop self-similarly across scales. Beyond this transition, the network exhibits self-similar topological growth, evidenced by a power-law decay in the increments of $\Delta$-simplices with $m$-dependent exponents. An analogous transition occurs in the Betti numbers, which display self-similar behavior near the TT and an arctangent dependence farther from it. Based on simulation data, we propose explicit scaling relations describing the behavior of both $\Delta$-simplices and Betti numbers near the TT. Overall, the analysis reveals a rich, gapful topological transition structure, where topological quantities exhibit discrete jumps at the transition point.

Title: Quantum-classical correspondence for spins at finite temperatures with application to Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: A. El Mendili, M. E. Zhitomirsky
Abstract: We consider quantum-to-classical mapping for an arbitrary system of interacting spins at finite temperatures. We prove that, in the large-$S$ limit, the asymptotic form of the partition function coincides with that of a classical model for spins of length $S_C=\sqrt{S(S+1)}$. Quantum corrections to the leading term form a series in powers of $1/[S(S+1)]$. This representation provides a rigorous basis for classical modeling of realistic magnetic Hamiltonians. As an application, the classical Monte Carlo simulations are performed to compute transition temperatures for several topical materials with known interaction parameters, including MnF$_2$, MnTe, Rb$_2$MnF$_4$, MnPSe$_3$, FePS$_3$, FePSe$_3$, CoPS$_3$, CrSBr, and CrI$_3$. The resulting transition temperatures show good agreement with experimental data.

Title: Thermal Decoherence and Population Transfer of MeV Channeling Electrons in Diamond
Authors: Tadas Paulauskas
Abstract: Channeling radiation in oriented crystals arises from transitions between quantized transverse bound states in the MeV regime and is strongly affected by thermal diffuse scattering through population transfer and decoherence. A frozen-phonon multislice propagation framework is developed to track a reduced transverse Hilbert space spanned by selected bound-state manifolds using configuration-resolved projection amplitudes. Beyond reproducing transition energies, the method yields reduced manifold density matrices, thermal population kinetics, and depth-resolved coherence metrics. Applied to axial electron channeling in $\langle100\rangle$ diamond at 16.9 MeV, the results show approximately exponential population loss with strongly state-dependent feeding among low-lying manifolds. For an initial coherent superposition in the degenerate 2p manifold, the intra-manifold purity relaxes toward the maximally mixed limit, consistent with thermally induced random basis rotations. Under 1s initial excitation, population transferred into the 2p and 3d manifolds remains close to maximally mixed, while weak cross-manifold coherences persist. The framework enables quantitative analysis of thermal population dynamics, decoherence, and their links to spontaneous and coherently driven emission observables across a broad range of crystal structures.

Title: Exciton-Selective Phonon Coupling in a Lead Halide Perovskite
Authors: Pradeepa H. L., Sagnik Chatterjee, Sayantan Patra, Swapneswar Bisoi, Saqlain Mushtaq, Hardeep, Akshay Singh, Ashish Arora, Atikur Rahman
Abstract: Exciton-phonon interactions govern the optical response of semiconductors, yet disentangling multiple coupling channels in lead halide perovskites remains challenging. We investigate CsPbBr3 microcrystals using photoluminescence, Raman and reflectance spectroscopy at low temperature, revealing the simultaneous presence of high-energy and Rashba excitons, each accompanied by distinct phonon replica series. High-energy exciton replicas are uniquely spaced by approximately 9 meV, whereas Rashba exciton replicas exhibit a characteristic approximately 6 meV spacing, indicating the specificity of the exciton-phonon coupling. Unsupervised machine learning applied to a large low-temperature photoluminescence dataset reveals these replica features are prevalent. With increasing temperature, replica features broaden and merge, evolving into a dominant longitudinal optical phonon coupling regime at room temperature. This work establishes direct spectroscopic evidence for concurrent, exciton-specific phonon coupling within a single material, offering new pathways to engineer light-matter interactions for optoelectronic and phonon-photon-based quantum device applications.

Title: The rise and fall of an oxide: insights into the phase diagram of bismuth oxide on Au(111)
Authors: Alberto Turoldo (1), Marco Bianchi (2), Alessandro Baraldi (1 and 2), Silvano Lizzit (2) ((1) Dipartimento di Fisica, Università degli Studi di Trieste, Trieste, Italy, (2) Elettra-Sincrotrone Trieste, Basovizza, Italy)
Abstract: Bismuth oxide (Bi$_2$O$_3$) is a polymorphic material of considerable technological interest, with applications spanning from heterogeneous catalysis to next-generation nanoelectronics. Despite its relevance, systematic investigations of Bi$_2$O$_3$ thin films remain scarce. Here, we report a comprehensive, multi-technique study of bismuth oxide grown on Au(111). By combining synchrotron-based x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and diffraction with low-energy electron diffraction and scanning tunneling microscopy, we elucidate the structural evolution of the surface during controlled oxidation and subsequent annealing. We find that Bi deposition induces well-defined surface reconstructions, whereas oxidation triggers the formation of a complex sequence of Bi$_2$O$_3$ domains. High-resolution spectroscopic and diffraction data enable us to propose a structural model consistent with the $(201)$ surface of $\beta$-Bi$_2$O$_3$. In addition, work function measurements reveal substantial electronic modifications at the interface. These results provide benchmark structural and electronic insights into the Bi oxide/Au(111) system and establish a framework for integrating Bi$_2$O$_3$ in devices in combination to two-dimensional semiconductors exploiting its low contact resistance.

Title: Anisotropic magnetism at the surface of a non-magnetic bulk insulator
Authors: Jarryd A. Horn, Keenan E. Avers, Nicholas Crombie, Shanta R. Saha, Johnpierre Paglione
Abstract: The potential for topological Kondo insulating behavior in d-electron systems has attracted interest in studying the surface states of the correlated insulators FeSb2 and FeSi. While detailed studies and theoretical description of a spin-orbit coupled ferromagnetic surface state have been applied to FeSi, the magnetic properties of the surface states of FeSb2 have not been addressed. Here, we report on the surface magnetic properties of FeSb2, utilizing the surface area dependence of magnetic susceptibility to separate the surface Curie-Weiss temperature dependence from the bulk spin-gap susceptibility. We use these results to further extract the surface magnetic anisotropy of a thin, rough-surfaced single-crystal FeSb2 to compare with the observed magnetotransport anisotropy, and find good agreement between the anisotropy in the surface magnetization and surface magnetotransport. We conclude with evidence of an anomalous Hall contribution to the low-temperature surface transport.

Title: Entanglement negativity in decohered topological states
Authors: Kang-Le Cai, Meng Cheng
Abstract: We investigate universal entanglement signatures of mixed-state phases obtained by decohering pure-state topological order (TO), focusing on topological corrections to logarithmic entanglement negativity and mutual information: topological entanglement negativity (TEN) and topological mutual information (TMI). For Abelian TOs under decoherence, we develop a replica field-theory framework based on a doubled-state construction that relates TEN and TMI to the quantum dimensions of domain-wall defects between decoherence-induced topological boundary conditions, yielding general expressions in the strong-decoherence regime. We further compute TEN and TMI exactly for decohered $G$-graded string-net states, including cases with non-Abelian anyons. We interpret the results within the strong one-form-symmetry framework for mixed-state TOs: TMI probes the total quantum dimension of the emergent premodular anyon theory, whereas TEN detects only its modular part.

Title: Addressing Ill-conditioning in Density Functional Theory for Reliable Machine Learning
Authors: L. Arnstein, J. Wetherell, R. Lawrence, P. J. Hasnip, M. J. P. Hodgson
Abstract: In principle, machine learning (ML) can be used to obtain any electronic property of a many-body system from its electron density within density functional theory. However, some physical quantities are highly sensitive to small variations in the density. This 'ill-conditioning' limits the accuracy with which these quantities can be learned as density functionals from a fixed amount of data. We identify sources of ill-conditioning present in density functionals that belong to two ubiquitous classes: 1) Physical quantities that are globally gauge-dependent, meaning they change value if a constant shift is applied to the external potential -- for example, the total energy; 2) Functionals of the N-electron density that have an implicit dependence on the (N+1)-electron density, such as the fundamental gap. We demonstrate that widely used ML models exhibit orders-of-magnitude greater error when applied to these ill-conditioned density functionals compared to other functionals that fall into neither class, even when the global gauge is fixed to prevent constant shifts. Owing to an absence of ill-conditioning in potential functionals, we find that providing the external potential as input to the ML model leads to significantly improved predictions of quantities in these two classes.

Title: Phase-Field Models for Particle-Stabilised Emulsions
Authors: Elisabeth C. Eij, Joost de Graaf, Martin F. Haase, Jesse M. Steenhoff
Abstract: Particle-stabilised emulsions are a cornerstone of soft matter science due to their broad application and fundamental relevance. Computer simulations provide key insights into the formation and behaviour of these emulsions, yet current methods are limited by the spatiotemporal scales accessible for study. The principal issue is that particles are resolved individually. In this work, an alternative strategy is introduced based on phase-field theory, for which we establish the framework. By evolving continuous fields, large-scale dynamics can be simulated in a computationally efficient manner. Our approach is then applied to model the complex formation of a bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gel (bijel) via solvent-transfer induced phase separation (STrIPS). By resolving the coupled dynamics of liquid phase separation and nanoparticle adsorption, the model allows for the characterisation of the influence of nanoparticles on the morphology. Higher concentrations of nanoparticles are found to reduce the average domain size of STrIPS bijels, in line with previous experimental evidence. The presented phase-field model thus represents a promising approach for the morphological investigation of complex particle-stabilised emulsions.

Title: Stoichiometry Dependent Properties of Cerium Hydride: An Active Learning Developed Interatomic Potential Study
Authors: Brenden W. Hamilton, Travis E. Jones, Timothy C. Germann, Benjamin T. Nebgen
Abstract: Cerium hydride has a variety of interesting properties, including a known lattice contraction and densification with increasing hydrogen content. However, precise stoichiometric control is not experimentally straightforward and {\it ab initio} approaches are not computationally feasible for many properties such as melting and low temperature diffusion. Therefore, we develop a machine-learned interatomic potential for cerium hydride that is valid for H to Ce ratios from 2.0 to 3.0. A query-by-committee active learning approach is used to develop the training set. Leveraging classical molecular dynamics simulations, we assess a range of properties and provide fundamental mechanisms for the trends with stoichiometry. A majority of the properties follow the trend of lattice contraction, being governed by the stronger lattice binding induced by adding octahedral atoms.

Title: Understanding the influence of yttrium on the dominant twinning mode and local mechanical field evolution in extruded Mg-Y alloys
Authors: Chaitali Patil, Qianying Shi, Abhishek Kumar, Veera Sundararaghavan, John Allison
Abstract: Twinning is a primary deformation mechanism in Mg alloys. This study focuses on tension twins during uniaxial compression of Mg-Y alloys, with three key aspects: the orientation specificity of twin grains, the relative evolution of CRSS with increasing Y content, and the local stress and strain evolution at twin sites. Experimental characterization and crystal plasticity modeling were performed. In Mg-7wt.%Y, TT2-{112-1} tension twins were observed in addition to the common TT1-{101-2} twins. Increasing Y suppressed TT1 formation while promoting TT2 activity. A previously unreported group of crystallographic orientations with a higher global Schmid factor for <c+a> slip was identified, which exhibited TT1 twinning with increasing compression strain. To elucidate Y effects on twin activity and local mechanical fields, both TT1 and TT2 tension twin modes were incorporated into PRISMS-Plasticity, an open-source, finite element-based crystal plasticity solver. Four binary Mg-Y alloys were modeled under compression, and statistical analysis was conducted to correlate initial orientations, stress-strain distributions, and twin activities as functions of Y concentration. The plasticity analysis revealed that increasing Y decreases the CRSS ratio of prismatic and pyramidal slip relative to TT1 twinning, while the slip-to-twin CRSS ratio for TT2 increases, thereby serving as a potential indicator of differential twin activity with Y addition in Mg alloys. Additionally, despite their small volume fraction, TT2 twin sites were predicted higher local strain accumulation locally, relative to the representative volume element and TT1 twins, suggesting their potential influence on localized phenomena such as recrystallization or twin nucleation. These findings provide insight into local mechanical behavior in Mg alloys and support alloy design for advanced engineering applications.

Title: Universal Framework for Decomposing Ionic Transport into Interpretable Mechanisms
Authors: KyuJung Jun, Pablo A. Leon, Jurğis Ruža, Juno Nam, Rafael Gómez-Bombarelli
Abstract: Understanding mechanisms of ion transport in bulk materials is central to designing next-generation ion conductors for energy storage devices, yet studies employing all-atom molecular dynamics (MD) have largely been limited to reporting overall transport coefficients without a quantitative, spatiotemporally resolved breakdown of \emph{how} charge is carried. We present a computational framework that analyzes MD trajectories to quantitatively interpret macroscopic transport by decomposing it into additive contributions from physically motivated events. They are defined either through heuristically identified microscopic transitions, capturing events such as single-ion hops, multi-ion hops, and vehicular motion, or through transitions between chemically interpretable coordination macrostates. The construction guarantees that attributed contributions sum exactly to the Onsager transport coefficients estimated via the Green-Kubo/Einstein formalism, while scanning the sampling window exposes characteristic temporal scales at which distinct transport mechanisms emerge and dominate. Applied across three prototypical electrolytes-inorganic crystals, liquids, and polymers-the framework quantitatively resolves long-standing debates (e.g., the role of concerted motion and exchange), identifies dominant mechanisms and rate-limiting steps, quantifies their frequencies and effectiveness, and extracts activation energies for distinct transport modes, thereby distilling design rules for fast conduction. This general and reproducible analysis tool turns MD trajectories into quantitative mechanism maps, enabling the ion-conductor community to adjudicate mechanistic hypotheses and accelerate discovery.

Title: Growth and crystallographic structure of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111): From sub-monolayer structures to single- and multi-layer films
Authors: Andreas Raabgrund, Tilman Kißlinger, Alexander Wegerich, Lutz Hammer, M. Alexander Schneider
Abstract: We investigated the initial growth of TiTe$_2$ on Au(111) from sub-monolayer to multi-layer coverage by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), low-energy electron diffraction intensity analysis (LEED-IV), and density functional theory (DFT). In the submonolayer regime we find a stable and well-ordered $(5\times\sqrt{3})_{\mathrm{rect}}$ superstructure consisting of separated TiTe$_2$ molecules, whereby the Ti atoms substitute Au atoms of the first substrate layer as proven by LEED-IV. By adding further Ti and Te in a 1:2 ratio and proper annealing dealloying sets in and a homogeneous 1T-TiTe$_2$ monolayer film on an unreconstructed substrate is formed. The resulting moiré structure is close to a $(4 \times 4)$ superstructure w.r.t. Au(111) and has a slightly expanded in-plane lattice parameter compared to the 1T-TiTe$_2$ bulk value. With further stoichiometric deposition, thicker 1T-TiTe$_2$ films grow. Surprisingly, a five layer thick film exhibits an even larger lattice-parameter (1.5 % larger than the bulk value). All LEED-IV analyses are based on best-fit R-factors of $R \le 0.13$.

Title: Current Induced Switching of Superconducting Order and Enhancement of Superconducting Diode Efficiency
Authors: Uddalok Nag, Jonathan Schirmer, Chao-Xing Liu, J. K. Jain
Abstract: We propose that the superconducting diode (SD) efficiency can be significantly enhanced near the transition between two superconducting states by choosing parameters where, before the system goes normal with increasing supercurrent, it switches into a different superconducting order for one direction of the current but not for the other. This mechanism for producing high SD efficiency relies on the expectation that the critical current depends sensitively on the superconducting order. We demonstrate this explicitly by performing detailed calculations for a bilayer superconductor with an in-plane magnetic field, which admits the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) and the orbital Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) orders as a function of the strength of the magnetic field. We predict a sharp peak in the SD efficiency in the FFLO state close to the transition, which arises from a complex interplay between the two superconducting orders. An implication of our study is that the measurement of the SD efficiency can provide fundamental insight into the nature of the BCS-FFLO transition both as a function of the magnetic field and the supercurrent.

Title: Design Principles for Fluid Molecular Ferroelectrics
Authors: Calum J Gibb, Jordan Hobbs, William C Ogle, Richard J Mandle
Abstract: Fluid molecular ferroelectrics are a new class of organic materials where ferroelectricity is found in conjunction with 3D fluidity whilst still retaining spontaneous polarization values comparable to their traditional solid state counterparts. One of the major challenges for soft condensed matter physics is predicting whether a fluid molecular material will form ferroelectric phase with nematic or smectic order. Through the synthesis of forty five systematically varied molecules, and by analogy to solid molecular ferroelectrics, is it shown that subtle hydrogen fluorine substitution allows for tuneable syn-parallel pairing motifs resulting in either specific pairings leading too geometrically constrained lamellar order or diversified pairings stabilising nematic ordering. Large-scale, fully atomistic molecular dynamics simulations reveal that smectic ferroelectricity emerges from discrete lateral pairing modes, whereas nematic phases arise from a multiplicity of equivalent polar configurations. Together, these findings establish experimentally validated design principles for fluid molecular ferroelectrics and provide a predictive framework for engineering functional polar fluids.

Title: A Tale of Two Plateaus: Competing Orders in Spin-1 and Spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ Pyrochlore Magnets
Authors: Imre Hagymási
Abstract: We use large-scale density-matrix renormalization group simulations with bond dimensions up to $20\ 000$ to determine the magnetization curves of spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ pyrochlore Heisenberg antiferromagnets. Both models exhibit a robust half-magnetization plateau, and we find that the same 16-site state (quadrupled unit cell) is selected in both cases on the largest 64-site cubic cluster we consider for the plateau state. This contrasts sharply with the effective quantum dimer model prediction which favors the ``R'' state, and demonstrates the breakdown of the perturbative mechanism at the Heisenberg point. These results provide a nonperturbative characterization of field-induced phases in pyrochlore magnets and predictive guidance for spin-1 and spin-$\tfrac{3}{2}$ materials.

Title: Optimizing p-spin models through hypergraph neural networks and deep reinforcement learning
Authors: Li Zeng, Mutian Shen, Tianle Pu, Zohar Nussinov, Qing Feng, Chao Chen, Zhong Liu, Changjun Fan
Abstract: p-spin glasses, characterized by frustrated many-body interactions beyond the conventional pairwise case (p>2), are prototypical disordered systems whose ground-state search is NP-hard and computationally prohibitive for large instances. Solving this problem is not only fundamental for understanding high-order disorder, structural glasses, and topological phases, but also central to a wide spectrum of hard combinatorial optimization tasks. Despite decades of progress, there still lacks an efficient and scalable solver for generic large-scale p-spin models. Here we introduce PLANCK, a physics-inspired deep reinforcement learning framework built on hypergraph neural networks. PLANCK directly optimizes arbitrary high-order interactions, and systematically exploits gauge symmetry throughout both training and inference. Trained exclusively on small synthetic instances, PLANCK exhibits strong zero-shot generalization to systems orders of magnitude larger, and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art thermal annealing methods across all tested structural topologies and coupling distributions. Moreover, without any modification, PLANCK achieves near-optimal solutions for a broad class of NP-hard combinatorial problems, including random k-XORSAT, hypergraph max-cut, and conventional max-cut. The presented framework provides a physics-inspired algorithmic paradigm that bridges statistical mechanics and reinforcement learning. The symmetry-aware design not only advances the tractable frontiers of high-order disordered systems, but also opens a promising avenue for machine-learning-based solvers to tackle previously intractable combinatorial optimization challenges.

Title: Exceptional horns in $n$-root graphene and Lieb photonic ring lattices
Authors: A. M. Marques, D. Viedma, V. Ahufinger, R. G. Dias
Abstract: We present a systematic construction of non-Hermitian tight-binding lattices whose Bloch spectra are $n$th roots of those of Hermitian parent two-dimensional (2D) lattices, namely graphene and the Lieb lattice. The $n$-roots of these models are constructed from connecting loop modules of unidirectional couplings whose geometrical arrangements match that of the corresponding parent system. Their energy spectrum is shown to consist of $n$ rotated and equivalent branches in the complex energy plane, each matching the real spectrum of the parent model when raised to the $n$th power, together with extra zero-energy flat bands (FBs) accounted for by the generalized index theorem. We show how the low-energy Dirac cones of the parent models translate, for an appropriate choice of phase configuration for the couplings of the $n$-root lattices, as what we call an "exceptional horn" appearing at each branch, with the central Dirac point (DP) converted into zero-energy exceptional points (EPs) of order $n$ or higher at high-symmetry momenta. These exceptional horns reflect the behavior of low-lying excitations that scale with momentum as $E\sim\vert \mathbf{q}\vert^{\frac{1}{n}}$, with $n\geq 3$, as opposed to the linear massless modes that characterize a Dirac cone. Moreover, we derive analytic expressions for the associated Landau levels (LLs), whose energies scale with magnetic flux as $E\sim\phi^{\frac{1}{2n}}$. For the case of the $n$-root Lieb lattice, the zeroth LL is shown to be exceptional. These results are analytically derived for both $n$-root models and numerically demonstrated for certain values of $n$. Finally, we propose a realistic photonic implementation based on coupled ring resonators with a split configuration of optical gain and loss.

Title: $p$-wave magnet driven field-free Josephson diode effect
Authors: Lovy Sharma, Bimal Ghimire, Manisha Thakurathi
Abstract: Recently, the superconducting diode effect (SDE), characterized by unequal critical currents in opposite directions, has been observed experimentally and predicted theoretically in models of bulk superconductors and Josephson junctions (JJs). In this work, we construct a Josephson junction using a recently discovered unconventional coplanar magnet, the $p$-wave magnet (PM), with proximity-induced superconductivity, and demonstrate the emergence of a Josephson diode effect (JDE). The barrier region is formed by another unconventional collinear magnet, namely an altermagnet (AM). We illustrate that apart from time-reversal and inversion symmetries, the mirror operation $M_{yz}$ emerges as the key symmetry constraint. Also, unlike earlier models that realize the JDE using unconventional magnets, this setup does not require Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC) or different superconductors across the junction. Moreover, we demonstrate that the realization of the JDE in this framework requires only minimal conditions while maintaining high performance. The effect remains robust across a broad parameter regime, and thus making the system particularly promising for applications in quantum circuits and computing technologies.

Title: Ab Initio Auxiliary-Field Quantum Monte Carlo in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Jinghong Zhang, Meng-Fu Chen, Adam Rettig, Tong Jiang, Paul J. Robinson, Hieu Q. Dinh, Anton Z. Ni, Joonho Lee
Abstract: Ab initio auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) is a systematically improvable many-body method, but its application to extended solids has been severely limited by unfavorable computational scaling and memory requirements that obstruct direct access to the thermodynamic and complete-basis-set limits. By combining tensor hypercontraction via interpolative separable density fitting with $\mathbf{k}$-point symmetry, we reduce the computational and memory scaling of ab initio AFQMC for solids to $O(N^3)$ and $O(N^2)$ with arbitrary basis, respectively, comparable to diffusion Monte Carlo. This enables direct and simultaneous thermodynamic-limit and complete-basis-set AFQMC calculations across insulating, metallic, and strongly correlated solids, without embedding, local approximations, empirical finite-size corrections, or composite schemes. Our results establish AFQMC as a general-purpose, systematically improvable alternative to diffusion Monte Carlo and coupled-cluster methods for predictive ab initio simulations of solids, enabling accurate energies and magnetic observables within a unified framework.

Title: Understanding the kinetics of static recrystallization in Mg-Zn-Ca alloys using an integrated PRISMS simulation framework

Abstract: Recrystallization is a phenomenon in which a plastically deformed polycrystalline microstructure with a high dislocation density transforms into another that has low dislocation density. This evolution is driven by the stored energy in dislocations, rather than grain growth driven by grain boundary energy alone. One difficulty in quantitative modeling of recrystallization is the uncertainty in material parameters, which can be addressed by integration of experimental data into simulations. In this work, we compare simulated static recrystallization dynamics of a Mg-3Zn-0.1Ca wt.% alloy to experiments involving thermomechanical processing followed by measurements of the recrystallization fraction over time. The simulations are performed by combining PRISMS software for crystal plasticity and phase-field models (PRISMS-Plasticity and PRISMS-PF, respectively) in an integrated computational materials engineering framework. At 20% strain and annealing at 350 °C, the model accurately describes recrystallization dynamics up to a mobility-dependent time scale factor. While the average grain boundary mobility and the fraction of plastic work converted into stored energy are not precisely known, by fitting simulations to experimental data, we show that the average grain boundary mobility can be determined if the fraction of plastic work converted to stored energy is known, or vice versa. For low annealing temperatures, we observe a discrepancy between the model and experiments in the late stages of recrystallization, where a slowdown in recrystallization kinetics occurs in the experiments. We discuss possible sources of this slowdown and propose additional physical mechanisms that need to be accounted for in the model to improve its predictions.

Title: Numerical Solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer Equation for Unconventional Superconductors
Authors: Andreas A. Buchheit, Torsten Keßler, Sergej Rjasanow
Abstract: In this work, we consider the analytical properties and the efficient numerical solution of the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer equation for unconventional superconductivity incorporating long-range power-law electron-electron interactions within a tight-binding model on a $d$-dimensional lattice. It is a nonlinear convolution equation for the complex matrix-valued superconducting gap under symmetry constraints imposed by the fermionic anticommutation rules. The long-range interaction enters in momentum space in the form of the now efficiently computable Epstein zeta function, which exhibits a power-law singularity at zero momentum. This needs to be accounted when evaluating the convolution. After a brief overview of some of the equation's analytical properties, we discuss its efficient numerical solution using a Galerkin method with B-splines. We present numerical results for a nodal superconductor on a two-dimensional square lattice.

Title: KPZ-like transport in long-range interacting spin chains proximate to integrability
Authors: Sajant Anand, Jack Kemp, Julia Wei, Christopher David White, Michael P. Zaletel, Norman Y. Yao
Abstract: Isotropic integrable spin chains such as the Heisenberg model feature superdiffusive spin transport belonging to an as-yet-unidentified dynamical universality class closely related to that of Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ). To determine whether these results extend to more generic one-dimensional models, particularly those realizable in quantum simulators, we investigate spin and energy transport in non-integrable, long-range Heisenberg models using state-of-the-art tensor network methods. Despite the lack of integrability and the asymptotic expectation of diffusion, for power-law models (with exponent $2 < \alpha < \infty$) we observe long-lived $z=3/2$ superdiffusive spin transport and two-point correlators consistent with KPZ scaling functions, up to times $t \sim 10^3/J$. We conjecture that this KPZ-like transport is due to the proximity of such power-law-interacting models to the integrable family of Inozemtsev models, which we show to also exhibit KPZ-like spin transport across all interaction ranges. Finally, we consider anisotropic spin models naturally realized in Rydberg atom arrays and ultracold polar molecules, demonstrating that a wide range of long-lived, non-diffusive transport can be observed in experimental settings.

Title: MolCrystalFlow: Molecular Crystal Structure Prediction via Flow Matching
Authors: Cheng Zeng, Harry W. Sullivan, Thomas Egg, Maya M. Martirossyan, Philipp Höllmer, Jirui Jin, Richard G. Hennig, Adrian Roitberg, Stefano Martiniani, Ellad B. Tadmor, Mingjie Liu
Abstract: Molecular crystal structure prediction represents a grand challenge in computational chemistry due to large sizes of constituent molecules and complex intra- and intermolecular interactions. While generative modeling has revolutionized structure discovery for molecules, inorganic solids, and metal-organic frameworks, extending such approaches to fully periodic molecular crystals is still elusive. Here, we present MolCrystalFlow, a flow-based generative model for molecular crystal structure prediction. The framework disentangles intramolecular complexity from intermolecular packing by embedding molecules as rigid bodies and jointly learning the lattice matrix, molecular orientations, and centroid positions. Centroids and orientations are represented on their native Riemannian manifolds, allowing geodesic flow construction and graph neural network operations that respects geometric symmetries. We benchmark our model against state-of-the-art generative models for large-size periodic crystals and rule-based structure generation methods on two open-source molecular crystal datasets. We demonstrate an integration of MolCrystalFlow model with universal machine learning potential to accelerate molecular crystal structure prediction, paving the way for data-driven generative discovery of molecular crystals.

Title: Strong-to-Weak Symmetry Breaking in Open Quantum Systems: From Discrete Particles to Continuum Hydrodynamics
Authors: Jacob Hauser, Kaixiang Su, Hyunsoo Ha, Jerome Lloyd, Thomas G. Kiely, Romain Vasseur, Sarang Gopalakrishnan, Cenke Xu, Matthew P. A. Fisher
Abstract: We explore the onset of spontaneous strong-to-weak symmetry breaking (SW-SSB) under U(1)-symmetric (i.e., charge-conserving) open-system dynamics. We define this phenomenon for quantum states and classical probability distributions, and explore it in three complementary models, one of which exhibits nontrivial quantum coherence at short times. Our main conclusions are as follows. In one dimension, the strong symmetry is not spontaneously broken at any finite time; however, correlators probing strong-to-weak symmetry breaking develop order on length scales that grow linearly in time, parametrically faster than charge diffusion. We provide numerical evidence for this scaling in multiple distinct probes of SW-SSB, and derive it from a field-theory analysis. Moreover, we relate this scaling to the problem of inferring the charge inside a subregion by measuring its surroundings, and construct explicit decoding protocols that illustrate its origin. In two dimensions, field theory and numerical simulations support a finite-time Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless-like SW-SSB transition. Within continuum hydrodynamics, by contrast, SW-SSB happens at infinitesimal time in two or more dimensions. The SW-SSB transition time can thus be interpreted as marking the emergence of a continuum hydrodynamic description, or (more precisely) the timescale beyond which non-hydrodynamic information such as discrete particle worldlines can no longer be inferred. We support this picture by analyzing a model in which we exploit SW-SSB to derive a classical stochastic hydrodynamic description from the underlying quantum dynamics.

Title: Reinforcement learning for path integrals in quantum statistical physics
Authors: Timour Ichmoukhamedov, Dries Sels
Abstract: Machine learning is rapidly finding its way into the field of computational quantum physics. One of the most popular and widely studied approaches in this direction is to use neural networks to model quantum states (NQS) in the Hamiltonian formulation of quantum mechanics. However, an alternative angle of attack to leverage machine learning in physics is through the path integral formulation, which has so far received far more limited attention. In this paper, we explore how reinforcement learning can be used to compute a class of Euclidean path integrals that yield the thermal density matrix of a quantum system, thereby enabling the computation of the free energy or other thermal expectation values. In particular, we propose a two-step approach with the unique feature that after a variational approximation for a quantity is obtained in a first step, it can then be used to efficiently compute the exact result in a second step. We benchmark this method on several simple systems and then apply it to the quantum rotor chain.

Title: Breaking the Moss rule
Authors: Søren Raza, Kristian Sommer Thygesen, Gururaj Naik
Abstract: Photonic devices depend critically on the dielectric materials from which they are made, with higher refractive indices and lower absorption losses enabling new functionalities and higher performance. However, these two material properties are intrinsically linked through the empirical Moss rule, which states that the refractive index of a dielectric decreases as its band gap energy increases. Materials that surpass this rule, termed super-Mossian dielectrics, combine large refractive indices with wide optical transparency and are therefore ideal candidates for advanced photonic applications. This Review surveys the expanding landscape of high-index dielectric and semiconductor materials, with a particular focus on those that surpass the Moss rule. We discuss how electronic band structures with a large joint density of states near the band edge give rise to super-Mossian behavior and how first-principles computational screening can accelerate their discovery. Finally, we establish how the refractive index sets the performance limits of nanoresonators, waveguides, and metasurfaces, highlighting super-Mossian dielectrics as a promising route toward the next performance leap in photonic technologies.

Title: Birefringence-Driven Anisotropic $α$-MoO3 Optical Cavities
Authors: Jia-Liang Xie, Ting-Ting Wang, Chen-Kai Liu, Rui Mei, Li-Fa Zhang, Miao-Ling Lin, Ping-Heng Tan
Abstract: Many anisotropic layered materials, despite their strong in-plane birefringence, exhibit substantial visible absorption, which severely restricts cavity lengths and hinders the observation of purely birefringence-governed optical phenomena. Here, we realize a birefringence-driven anisotropic optical cavity using $\alpha$-MoO3 flakes, capitalizing on their ultralow optical loss and pronounced in-plane birefringence. Using angle-resolved polarized Raman (ARPR) spectroscopy, we observe a mode-sensitive enhancement of anisotropy, dependent on both flake thickness and Raman shift. A unified model that incorporates the intrinsic Raman tensor, birefringence, and chromatic dispersion accurately reproduces the experimental data, elucidating how cavity resonances at both excitation and scattered wavelengths interact. Within this framework, the intrinsic phonon anisotropy is quantified, providing invaluable insights for accurately predicting ARPR responses and identifying crystallographic orientation. This work provides fundamental insights into birefringence-governed cavities and opens avenues for high-performance birefringent optics and cavity-enhanced anisotropic phenomena.

Title: Where Multipartite Entanglement Localizes: The Junction Law for Genuine Multi-Entropy
Authors: Norihiro Iizuka, Akihiro Miyata
Abstract: We uncover a "junction law" for genuine multipartite entanglement, suggesting that in gapped local systems multipartite entanglement is controlled and effectively localized near junctions where subsystem boundaries meet. Using the Rényi-2 genuine multi-entropy $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ as a diagnostic of genuine $\mathtt{q}$-partite entanglement, we establish this behavior in $(2+1)$-dimensional gapped free-fermion lattices with correlation length $\xi$. For partitions with a single junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ exhibits a universal scaling crossover in $L/\xi$, growing for $L\ll\xi$ and saturating to a $\xi$-dependent constant for $L\gg\xi$, up to $\mathcal{O}(e^{-L/\xi})$ corrections. In sharp contrast, for partitions without a junction, $\mathrm{GM}^{(\mathtt{q})}_2$ is exponentially suppressed in $L/\xi$ and drops below numerical resolution once $L\gg\xi$. We observe the same pattern for $\mathtt{q}=3$ (tripartite) and $\mathtt{q}=4$ (quadripartite) cases, and further corroborate this localization by translating the junction at fixed system size. We also provide a geometric explanation of the junction law in holography. Altogether, these results show that in this gapped free-fermion setting genuine multipartite entanglement is localized within a correlation-length neighborhood of junctions.

Title: Why the Casimir Force for Magnetic Metals Computed by the Lifshitz Theory Using the Drude Model Disagrees with the Measurement Data
Authors: G. L. Klimchitskaya, C. C. Korikov, V. M. Mostepanenko
Abstract: We consider the Casimir force in configurations with magnetic metal plates and analyze the reasons why the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the dielectric permittivity of the Drude model are inconsistent with the measurement data. For this purpose, the contributions of the electromagnetic waves with the transverse magnetic and transverse electric polarizations to the Casimir force are computed using the Lifshitz theory expressed in terms of the pure imaginary Matsubara frequencies. Furthermore, the fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in these contributions are found using an equivalent formulation of the Lifshitz theory along the real frequency axis. All computations are performed for Au-Ni and Ni-Ni plates using the Drude model and the experimentally consistent plasma model over the separation region from 0.5 to 6~mum, where the total force value is determined by conduction electrons. It is shown that the transverse magnetic contribution to the Casimir force does not depend on the used model of the dielectric permittivity, so that the total difference between the predictions of the Lifshitz theory using the Drude model and the measurement data is determined by the transverse electric contribution. In doing so, as opposed to the case of nonmagnetic metals, both fractions of the evanescent and propagating waves in this contribution depend on the model of the dielectric permittivity used in computations, whereas the magnetic properties of the plate metal influence the Casimir force solely through the fraction of propagating waves in the transverse electric contribution. The issue of a more adequate theoretical description of the electromagnetic response of magnetic metals is discussed.

Title: Evolutionary Advantage of Diversity-Generating Retroelements in Switching Environments
Authors: Léo Régnier, Paul Rochette, Raphaël Laurenceau, David Bikard, Simona Cocco, Rémi Monasson
Abstract: Diversity-Generating Retroelements (DGRs) create rapid, targeted variation within specific genomic regions in phages and bacteria. They operate through stochastic retro-transcription of a template region (TR) into a variable region (VR), which typically encodes ligand-binding proteins. Despite their prevalence, the evolutionary conditions that maintain such hypermutating systems remain unclear. Here we introduce a two-timescale framework separating fast VR diversification from slow TR evolution, allowing the dynamics of DGR-controlled loci to be analytically understood from the TR design point of view. We quantity the fitness gain provided by the diversification mechanism of DGR in the presence of environmental switching with respect to standard mutagenesis. Our framework accounts for observed patterns of DGR activity in human-gut \textit{Bacteroides} and clarifies when constitutive DGR activation is evolutionarily favored.

Title: The Quantum Symmetric Simple Exclusion Process in the Continuum and Free Processes
Authors: Denis Bernard
Abstract: The quantum symmetric simple exclusion process (QSSEP) is a recent extension of the symmetric simple exclusion process, designed to model quantum coherent fluctuating effects in noisy diffusive systems. It models stochastic nearest-neighbor fermionic hopping on a lattice, possibly driven out-of-equilibrium by boundary processes. We present a direct formulation in the continuum, and establish how this formulation captures the scaling limit of the discrete version. In the continuum, QSSEP emerges as a non-commutative process, driven by free increments, conditioned on the algebra of functions on the ambiant space to encode spatial correlations. We actually develop a more general framework dealing with conditioned orbits with free increments which may find applications beyond the present context. We view this construction as a preliminary step toward formulating a quantum extension of the macroscopic fluctuation theory.

Title: Factorization Machine with Quadratic-Optimization Annealing for RNA Inverse Folding and Evaluation of Binary-Integer Encoding and Nucleotide Assignment
Authors: Shuta Kikuchi, Shu Tanaka
Abstract: The RNA inverse folding problem aims to identify nucleotide sequences that preferentially adopt a given target secondary structure. While various heuristic and machine learning-based approaches have been proposed, many require a large number of sequence evaluations, which limits their applicability when experimental validation is costly. We propose a method to solve the problem using a factorization machine with quadratic-optimization annealing (FMQA). FMQA is a discrete black-box optimization method reported to obtain high-quality solutions with a limited number of evaluations. Applying FMQA to the problem requires converting nucleotides into binary variables. However, the influence of integer-to-nucleotide assignments and binary-integer encoding on the performance of FMQA has not been thoroughly investigated, even though such choices determine the structure of the surrogate model and the search landscape, and thus can directly affect solution quality. Therefore, this study aims both to establish a novel FMQA framework for RNA inverse folding and to analyze the effects of these assignments and encoding methods. We evaluated all 24 possible assignments of the four nucleotides to the ordered integers (0-3), in combination with four binary-integer encoding methods. Our results demonstrated that one-hot and domain-wall encodings outperform binary and unary encodings in terms of the normalized ensemble defect value. In domain-wall encoding, nucleotides assigned to the boundary integers (0 and 3) appeared with higher frequency. In the RNA inverse folding problem, assigning guanine and cytosine to these boundary integers promoted their enrichment in stem regions, which led to more thermodynamically stable secondary structures than those obtained with one-hot encoding.

Title: Exponential concentration of fluctuations in mean-field boson dynamics
Authors: Matias Gabriel Ginzburg, Simone Rademacher, Giacomo De Palma
Abstract: We study the mean-field dynamics of a system of $N$ interacting bosons starting from an initially condensated state. For a broad class of mean-field Hamiltonians, including models with arbitrary bounded interactions and models with unbounded interaction potentials, we prove that the probability of having $n$ particles outside the condensate decays exponentially in $n$ for any finite evolution time. Our results strengthen previously known bounds that provide only polynomial control on the probability of having $n$ excitations.

Title: Connected Network Model for the Mechanical Loss of Amorphous Materials
Authors: Steven Blaber, Daniel Bruns, Jörg Rottler
Abstract: Dissipation in amorphous solids at low frequencies is commonly attributed to activated transitions of isolated two-level systems (TLS) that come in resonance with elastic or electric fields. Materials with low mechanical or dielectric loss are urgently needed for applications in gravitational wave detection, high precision sensors, and quantum computing. Using atomistic modeling, we explore the energy landscape of amorphous silicon and titanium dioxide, and find that the pairs of energy minima that constitute single TLS form a sparsely connected network with complex topologies. Motivated by this observation, we develop an analytically tractable theory for mechanical loss of the full network from a nonequilibrium thermodynamic perspective. We demonstrate that the connectivity of the network introduces new mechanisms that can both reduce low frequency dissipation through additional low energy relaxation pathways, and increase dissipation through a broad distribution of energy minima. As a result, the connected network model predicts mechanical loss with distinct frequency profiles compared to the isolated TLS model. This not only calls into question the validity of the TLS model, but also gives us many new avenues and properties to analyze for the targeted design of low mechanical loss materials.

Title: Anisotropic sub-band splitting mechanisms in strained HgTe: a first principles study
Authors: Eeshan Ketkar, Giovanni Marini, Pietro Maria Forcella, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Gianni Profeta, Wouter Beugeling
Abstract: Mercury telluride is a canonical material for realizing topological phases, yet a full understanding of its electronic structure remains challenging due to subtle competing effects. Using first-principles calculations and $\mathbf{k}\cdot\mathbf{p}$ modelling, we study its topological phase diagram under strain. We show that linearly $k$-dependent higher-order $C_4$ strain terms are essential for capturing the correct low-energy behaviour. These terms lead to a nontrivial $k$-dependence of the sub-band splitting arising from the interplay of strain and bulk inversion asymmetry. This explains the camel-back feature in the tensile regime and supports the emergence of a Weyl semimetal phase under compressive strain.

Title: 1+1d SPT phases with fusion category symmetry: interface modes and non-abelian Thouless pump
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Shuhei Ohyama
Abstract: We consider symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases with finite non-invertible symmetry $\mathcal{C}$ in 1+1d. In particular, we investigate interfaces and parameterized families of them within the framework of matrix product states. After revealing how to extract the $\mathcal{C}$-SPT invariant, we identify the algebraic structure of symmetry operators acting on the interface of two $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. By studying the representation theory of this algebra, we show that there must be a degenerate interface mode between different $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phases. This result generalizes the bulk-boundary correspondence for ordinary SPT phases. We then propose the classification of one-parameter families of $\mathcal{C}$-SPT states based on the explicit construction of invariants of such families. Our invariant is identified with a non-abelian generalization of the Thouless charge pump, which is the pump of a local excitation within a $\mathcal{C}$-SPT phase. Finally, by generalizing the results for one-parameter families of SPT phases, we conjecture the classification of general parameterized families of general gapped phases with finite non-invertible symmetries in both 1+1d and higher dimensions.

Title: How Subradiance Enables Nonlinearity in Weakly Driven Quantum Arrays
Authors: Orazio Scarlatella, Nigel R. Cooper
Abstract: Harnessing the nonlinear response of a medium is essential for applications including frequency conversion and light amplification, as well as for the generation of quantum many-body correlations of light or matter. However, achieving these effects typically requires high drive intensities and thick samples, which induce undesired heating effects that typically suppress quantum correlations. In this work, we demonstrate that atom-thin arrays of quantum emitters exhibit a robust nonlinear response even at arbitrarily weak drive intensities. This discovery challenges the long-held assumption that weakly driven ensembles behave classically; instead, we reveal that subradiant states provide a dominant nonlinear contribution that persists in the low-intensity limit. Using a Dynamical Mean-Field Theory (DMFT) approach, we predict that these nonlinearities generate a quantum-correlated steady state composed of interacting pairs of subradiant excitations, characterized by long-range correlations and multi-mode squeezing. Our findings establish a new frontier for nonlinear quantum optics at minimal power, and provide a scalable protocol for preparing multimode squeezing, offering potential for applications in quantum metrology.

Title: The Ising dual-reflection interface: $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry and Majorana strong zero modes
Authors: Juliane Graf, Federica Maria Surace, Marcus Berg, Sergej Moroz
Abstract: We investigate an interface in the transverse field quantum Ising chain connecting an ordered ferromagnetic phase and a disordered paramagnetic phase that are Kramers-Wannier duals of each other. Unlike prior studies focused on non-invertible defects, this interface exhibits a symmetry that combines Kramers-Wannier transformation with spatial reflection. We demonstrate that, under open boundary conditions, this setup gives rise to a discrete $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, encompassing the conventional $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Ising parity as a subgroup, while in a closed geometry a non-invertible symmetry emerges. Using the Jordan-Wigner transformation, we map the spin chain onto a solvable quadratic Majorana fermion system. In this formulation, the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry is realized manifestly as a parity-dependent reflection with respect to a Majorana site, in contrast to the conventional reflection which mirrors with respect to the central link of the Majorana chain. Additionally, we construct Majorana strong zero modes that retain the $\mathbb{Z}_4$ symmetry, ensure degeneracies of all energy eigenstates, and are robust under generic local symmetry-preserving perturbations of the fermion model, including interactions. Finally, we develop quantum circuit realizations of our model paving the way towards the creation of exact Majorana strong zero modes with digital quantum hardware.

Title: Entropy spectroscopy of a bilayer graphene quantum dot

Abstract: We measure the entropy change of charge transitions in an electrostatically defined quantum dot in bilayer graphene. Entropy provides insights into the equilibrium thermodynamic properties of both ground and excited states beyond transport measurements. For the one-carrier regime, the obtained entropy shows that the ground state has a two-fold degeneracy lifted by an out-of-plane magnetic field. This observation is in agreement with previous direct transport measurements and confirms the applicability of this novel method. For the two-carrier regime, the extracted entropy indicates a non-degenerate ground state at zero magnetic field, contrary to previous studies suggesting a three-fold degeneracy. We attribute the degeneracy lifting to the effect of Kane-Mele type spin--orbit interaction on the two-carrier ground state, which has not been observed before. Our work demonstrates the validity and efficacy of entropy measurements as a unique, supplementary experimental tool to investigate the degeneracy of the ground state in quantum devices build in materials such as graphene. This technique, applied to exotic systems with fractional ground state entropies, will be a powerful tool in the study of quantum matter.

Title: Quantum Electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels in a deep-subwavelength hyperbolic phonon polariton cavity
Authors: Gian Marcello Andolina, Matteo Ceccanti, Bianca Turini, Riccardo Riolo, Marco Polini, Marco Schiró, Frank H.L. Koppens
Abstract: The confinement of electromagnetic radiation within extremely small volumes offers an effective means to significantly enhance light-matter interactions, to the extent that zero-point quantum vacuum fluctuations can influence and control the properties of materials. Here, we develop a theoretical framework for the quantum electrodynamics of graphene Landau levels embedded in a deep subwavelength hyperbolic cavity, where light is confined into ultrasmall mode volumes. By studying the spectrum, we discuss the emergence of polaritons, and disentangle the contributions of resonant quantum vacuum effects from those of purely electrostatic interactions. Finally, we study the hybridization between magnetoplasmons and the cavity's electromagnetic modes.

Title: Magnetizing altermagnets by ultrafast asymmetric spin dynamics
Authors: Zhaobo Zhou, Sangeeta Sharma, John Kay Dewhurst, Junjie He
Abstract: Laser pulses are known to induce symmetric demagnetization: equal loss of magnetic moments in the identical sublattices of antiferromagnets and ferromagnets at ultrashort timescales. Using time-dependent density functional theory, we show that linearly polarized laser pulses can drive asymmetric demagnetization between otherwise identical sublattices in the $d$-wave compensated altermagnet (AM) RuO$_2$, resulting in a \textit{photo-induced ferrimagnetic state} with a strong net magnetization of $\sim$0.2 $\mu_B$ per unit cell. The sign and magnitude of this metastable magnetization are highly controllable by laser polarization. We identify polarization-selective asymmetric optical intersite spin transfer (a-OISTR) as the primary mechanism generating the net moment, followed by asymmetric spin flips (a-SF) that further amplifies it. Both effects originate from the characteristic nodal spin band topology of \textit{d}-wave AMs. Moreover, we demonstrate that this laser-induced magnetization is universal across various $d$-wave AMs, including experimentally confirmed KV$_2$Se$_2$O and RbV$_2$Te$_2$O. We uncover a robust route to light-controlled magnetization in AMs on ultrafast timescales.

Title: Large critical current density Josephson $π$ junctions with PdNi barriers
Authors: Arjun Sapkota, Pukar Sedai, Robert M. Klaes, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge, Nathan Satchell
Abstract: We report large $\pi$-state critical current densities, $J_c(\pi)$, in Nb/Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$/Nb Josephson junctions at Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ thicknesses near the first $\pi$-state. We observe oscillations in the critical current with ferromagnetic barrier thickness consistent with a $0$-$\pi$ transition. For a junction with a 9.4~nm Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ barrier, we obtain $J_c(\pi) = 410~\mathrm{kA/cm^{2}}$ at 4.2~K, exceeding values reported in prior PdNi-based studies. Magnetization measurements on continuous films, together with coercivity tests on patterned arrays, confirm that Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ exhibits perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, enabling zero-field operation without magnetic initialization. The combination of large $J_c(\pi)$ and intrinsic anisotropy establishes Pd$_{89}$Ni$_{11}$ as a promising barrier material for passive $\pi$-shifters in superconducting digital logic and qubit architectures.

Title: The extensive photo response on metal/n-Si clarified by the zero-gap with inter-band phonon scatterings
Authors: Kazuya Nakayam, Takanari Yasui
Abstract: UVA to NIR with multi-directional photo responses have been found on metal (Au)/n-Si device. A reasonable explanation has not been found in various physical models of Si-devices for the phenomena. We approached a zero-gap at X (reciprocal point) in two conduction bands of Si to analysis the optical response with the inter-band phonon scatterings. The calculation of the quantum efficiency between X-$\Gamma$ and X-W successfully simulated the sensitivities in visible region (1.1 to 2.0 eV), the carrier density profile well fitted the response in NIR (0.6 to 1.0 eV). Filling up the zero-gap by doping electrons ($\sim 10^{18}$/cm$^3$) at around X, a lower limit of 0.6 eV arose in the measurement below Si-band gap of 1.17 eV. Indirect/direct transitions of inter conduction bands: X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L in the 1st Brillouin Zone/Van Hove singularity at L point, synchronizing with phonon scattering, gave a variety of directional photo-responses. The carrier scattering model for the inter bands (X-W, X-K and $\Gamma$-L) were consistent with the directional dependence of photo-currents under UVA (3.4 eV) and Visible (3.06 eV) excitations. Band to band scatterings assisted to extend the available optical range and increase its variety of directional responses. Utilizing this principle, a new frontier will be opened in the photo-conversion system by using indirect-transition semiconductors and thus, it will be released from those band gaps and directivity limitations.

Abstract: The local environment of Mn atoms in stoichiometric Ni-Mn-Ga Heusler alloys was investigated using Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and interpreted with the help of Density Functional Theory (DFT) methods. In cubic austenite, the significant amount of structural defects was observed in \mn NMR experiments and interpreted using DFT calculations as individual antisite defects or defects accompanying anti-phase boundaries. Combined NMR and DFT analysis provides a consistent microscopic description of local disorder in Ni-Mn-Ga.

Title: Nonequilibrium Theory for Adaptive Systems in Varying Environments
Authors: Ying-Jen Yang, Charles D. Kocher, Ken A. Dill
Abstract: Biological organisms are adaptive, able to function in unpredictably changing environments. Drawing on recent nonequilibrium physics, we show that in adaptation, fitness has two components parameterized by observable coordinates: a static Generalism component characterized by state distributions, and a dynamic Tracking component sustained by nonequilibrium fluxes. Our findings: (1) General Theory: We prove that tracking gain scales strictly with environmental variability and switching time-scales; near-static or fast-switching environments are not worth tracking. (2) Optimal Strategies: We explain optimal bet-hedging and phenotypic memory as the interplay between these components. (3) Control: We demonstrate, with an example, how to suppress pathogens by independently attacking their Generalism robustness (via environmental time fractions) and Tracking capabilities (via environmental switching speed). This work provides a physical framework for understanding and controlling adaptivity.

Title: Resonating Valence Bond Ground States on Corner-sharing Simplices
Authors: Zhao Zhang, Cecilie Glittum
Abstract: The Hubbard model in the $U\to\infty$ limit has been known to have resonating valence bond (RVB) ground states on certain corner-sharing simplex lattices. Examples include both the quasi-1D sawtooth lattice with open boundary and a larger class of higher dimensional lattices without boundaries. The two types of results were obtained by different approaches which do not apply to one another. In the second class of lattices, the simplest simplex is a tetrahedron. We hereby generalize both results by studying the singly hole-doped system on the quasi-1D lattice of a tetrahedron chain, which can be considered a stripe of the pyrochlore or checkerboard lattices. The energy level ordering of irreducible representations of each tetrahedron shows that a chain of them has exponentially degenerate partial RVB or dimer-monomer ground states where each tetrahedron hosts one spin-$1/2$ monomer and one spin-$0$ dimer. The exact ground states in the infinitely long chain limit are analytically solved by introducing basis transformations between local Hilbert spaces of neighboring tetrahedra, and its energy agrees with the extrapolation of numerical exact diagonalization results of finite sized systems.

Title: Electronic and structural properties of Rh- and Pd-based kagome layered shandites from first principles
Authors: Luca Buiarelli, Turan Birol, Brian M. Andersen, Morten H. Christensen
Abstract: The shandite structure hosts transition metal ions arranged in kagome layers. These layers are stacked rhombohedrally and are interspersed with post-transition metal ions and chalcogens. The electronic states near the Fermi level are dominated by the transition metal $d$-orbitals and feature saddle points near several of the high-symmetry positions of the Brillouin zone, most notably the F and L points. Combining symmetry considerations with ab initio methods, we study the electronic and structural properties of these materials with an emphasis on the connection between electronic saddle points at specific momenta and structural instabilities at these momenta. While the parent compounds studied are all found to be structurally stable under ambient conditions, we show that, in specific compounds, moving the saddle point closer to the Fermi level using either hydrostatic pressure or doping, can induce a structural instability. The importance of the electronic degrees of freedom in driving this instability is supported by the dependence of the frequency of the soft phonon mode on the electronic smearing temperature. Our first-principles calculations show that as the smearing temperature is increased, the compound becomes structurally stable again, indicating that the electron-phonon coupling is playing an important role. Our findings survey the structural properties of a large family of shandite materials and shed light on the role played by saddle points in the electronic structure in driving structural instabilities in rhombohedrally stacked kagome-layered materials.

Authors: Michelle Ocker, Franziska Walther, Nour Maraytta, Matthieu Le Tacon, Michael Merz, Cornelius Krellner, Kristin Kliemt
Abstract: Single crystals of EuPd$_3$Si$_2$ were grown using a high-temperature EuPd-flux method. The material was structurally and chemically characterized by single-crystal x-ray diffraction, powder x-ray diffraction, Laue method and energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy. The structural analysis confirmed the orthorhombic crystal structure (space group $Imma$) but revealed differences in the lattice parameters and bond distances in comparison to previous work by Sharma et al.. The composition is close to the ideal 1:3:2 stoichiometry with an occupation of 7 % of the Si sites by Pd. The heat capacity, electrical resistivity, and magnetic susceptibility show two magnetic transitions indicating magnetic ordering below $T_{\rm N1}= 61\,\rm K$ and a spin reorientation at $T_{\rm N2}= 40\,\rm K$. The orthorhombic material shows magnetic anisotropy with field applied along the three main symmetry axes, which is summarized in the temperature-field phase diagrams. The susceptibility data hint to an alignment of the magnetic moments along $[100]$ between $T_{\rm N1}$ and $T_{\rm N2}$. Below $T_{\rm N2}$ the magnetic structure changes to an arrangement with moments canted away from $[100]$. In contrast to published work by Sharma et al., the single crystals investigated in this study are suggested to show AFM order below $T_{\rm N1}$ instead of ferromagnetism that sets in at higher $T_{\rm C1}=78\,\rm K$ which might originate from certain differences in the structure, composition or defects that have an impact on the dominant coupling constants of the RKKY interaction.

Title: In situ elucidation of mechanisms governing crack transition to plasticity arrest
Authors: Abdalrhaman Koko, Bemin Sheen, Caitlin Green, Fionn Dunne
Abstract: Despite extensive theoretical treatment of short- to long-crack transitions, direct experimental quantification of how elastic and plastic energy contributions evolve at the crack tip during arrest has remained absent. In this study, we present an in situ investigation of crack propagation in cold-worked AA-5052 using high-resolution scanning electron microscopy digital image correlation (SEM-DIC) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD). By reconstructing local crack-tip fields from measured displacement data, we extract mode I and II stress intensity factors and both elastic and elastoplastic energy release rates ({\Delta}JE and {\Delta}Jp). The results show that microstructure-sensitive cracks propagate in a mixed-mode manner at low driving force and transition to plasticity-dominated and load-aligned crack, arrested as the crack-tip process zone develops and expands multiple grains. This transition is identified through the divergence of elastic and elastoplastic energy measures ({\Delta}JE >= {\Delta}JP), crack-tip blunting, slip-band emission, and the emergence of localised plastic deformation. These findings demonstrate that crack arrest coincides with a measurable transition in crack-tip energy partitioning and with process-zone expansion beyond grain-scale dimensions. The results establish an experimentally measurable energy-partition criterion for crack arrest and demonstrate that fracture regime transition is governed by

Title: Effects of intertube dipole-dipole interactions in nearly integrable one-dimensional $^{162}$Dy gases
Authors: Yicheng Zhang, Kangning Yang, Benjamin L. Lev, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We study the effects of the intertube dipole-dipole interactions (DDI) in recent experiments with arrays of nearly integrable one-dimensional (1D) dipolar Bose gases of $^{162}$Dy atoms. An earlier theoretical modeling ignored those interactions, which we include here via a modification of the 1D confining potentials. We investigate the effects of the intertube DDI both during the state preparation and during the measurements of the rapidity distributions. We explore how the strength of the contact interactions and the magnetic field angles modify the intertube DDI corrections. We find that those corrections slightly change both the properties of the equilibrium state and the rapidity measurements. Remarkably, however, the changes nearly cancel each other, resulting in measured rapidity distributions that are very close to those predicted in the absence of the intertube DDI.

Title: Kekulé Superconductivity in Twisted Magic Angle Bilayer Graphene
Authors: Ke Wang, K. Levin
Abstract: While it has been one of the most important new physics discoveries in the last decade, the nature of superconductivity in the twisted graphene family remains an unsolved problem. Motivated by recent scanning tunneling experiments that report Kekulé ordering in moiré graphene superconductors, we develop a microscopic theory of this superconductivity for the twisted bilayer system. The pairing we find is an intra-valley, finite-momentum pair-density wave (PDW) that intrinsically carries a Kekulé modulation. This state exhibits four salient features: (i) spontaneous breaking of $C_3$ rotation symmetry, producing nematic order (ii)with triplet pairing; and (iii) a quasiparticle density of states that evolves from a V-shaped profile to a fully gapped, U-shaped spectrum as the attraction increases which is accompanied by (iv) systematic behavior of the temperature dependent zero bias conductance. These features align with key experimental signatures. We find, as well, that with only modest interaction strengths, the state is near to a BEC-like phase, consistent with the observed extremely short coherence lengths. Taken together, these results identify a microscopic intra-valley Kekulé PDW as a compelling candidate for unconventional superconductivity in the twisted graphene family.

Title: Effects of interlayer Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction on the shape and dynamics of magnetic twin-skyrmions
Authors: Tim Matthies, Levente Rózsa, Roland Wiesendanger, Elena Y. Vedmedenko
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions have been proposed as promising candidates for storing information due to their high stability and easy manipulation by spin-polarized currents. Here, we study how these properties are influenced by the interlayer Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction (IL-DMI), which stabilizes twin-skyrmions in magnetic bilayers. We find that the spin configuration of the twin-skyrmion adapts to the direction of the IL-DMI by elongating or changing the helicities in the two layers. Driving the skyrmions by spin-polarized currents in the current-perpendicular-to-plane configuration, we observe significant changes either in the skyrmion velocity or in the skyrmion Hall angle depending on the current polarization. These findings unravel further prospects for skyrmion manipulation enabled by the IL-DMI.

Title: Anderson localization: A view from Krylov space
Authors: J. Clayton Peacock, Vadim Oganesyan, Dries Sels
Abstract: The Krylov subspace expansion is a workhorse method for sparse numerics that has been increasingly explored as source of physical insight into many-body dynamics in recent years. In this work we revisit the venerable Anderson model of localization in dimensions $d=1, 2, 3, 4$ to construct local integrals of motion (LIOM) in Krylov space. These appear as zero eigenvalue edge states of an effective hopping problem in the Krylov superoperator subspace and can be analytically constructed given the Lanczos coefficients. We exploit this idea, focusing on $d=3$, to study the manifestation of the disorder driven Anderson transition in the anatomy of LIOMs. We find that the increasing complexity of the Krylov operators results in a suppression of the fluctuations of the Lanczos coefficients. As such, one can study the phenomenology of the integrals of motion in the disorder averaged Krylov chain. We find edge states localized on vanishing fraction of Krylov space (of dimension $D_K=V^2$ for cubes of volume $V$), both in localized and extended phases. Importantly, in the localized phase, disorder induces powerlaw decaying dimerization in the (Krylov) hopping problem, producing stretched exponential decay of the LIOMs in Krylov space with a stretching exponent $1/2d$. Metallic LIOMs are completely delocalized albeit across only $\propto \sqrt{D_K}$ states. Critical LIOMs exhibit powerlaw decay with an exponent matching the expected value of $0.29$.

Abstract: Laser-generated surface acoustic waves (SAW) facilitate efficient information processing in modern spintronics and magnonics. The ability to tune the SAW parameters such as amplitude is crucial to achieve acoustic control over magnonic properties. Such tunability can be achieved in phasechanging magnetic materials that accommodate both spin waves and SAWs. A promising material is the FeRh alloy, a metallic antiferromagnet at room temperature that undergoes a phase transition to the ferromagnetic state accompanied by a crystal lattice expansion at 370 K. This transition can also be induced by femtosecond laser pulses. In this paper, we use the phase transition in a 60 nm Fe49Rh51 film to optically generate pulses of Gigahertz quasi-Rayleigh SAWs. We detect them via the photoelastic effect and show that the lattice transformation during the phase transition is a dominant strain-generation mechanism for above-threshold excitation. The weight of this contribution rises as the sample is heated closer to the AFM-FM transition temperature and 'switches off' when heated above it, allowing for control of the SAW amplitude. A model based on thermodynamic parameters of Fe49Rh51 shows that the lattice transformation occurring within 95 ps effectively contributes to SAW generation happening on a comparable timescale, while non-equilibrium fast kinetics of the phase transition does not.

Title: Mass-imbalance effect on the cluster formation in a one-dimensional Fermi gas with coexistent $s$- and $p$-wave interactions
Authors: Yixin Guo
Abstract: We consider the mass-imbalance effect on the clustering in a one-dimensional two-component Fermi gas with coexistent even- and odd-wave interactions resulting in different configurations of clustering phases. We obtain the solutions of both stable two- and three-body cluster states with different mass ratios and configurations by solving the corresponding variational equations. We numerically map out phase diagrams consisting of the $s$- and $p$-wave pairing phases, and {trimer} phase with different configurations, in a plane of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths. Within the explored ranges of $s$- and $p$-wave pairing strengths, the in-vacuum three-body states are always more deeply bound than the two-body ones. While for the in-medium case, the Cooper {trimer} phase dominates over the pairing phases when both $s$- and $p$-wave interactions are moderately strong. There is also a competition between different clustering configurations of three-body clustering.

Title: Evolution of the contact between rough viscoelastic solids after decreasing loads: memory erasure and monotonic increase
Authors: Zichen Li, Renald Brenner, Lucas Frérot
Abstract: The real area of contact governs, in part, the magnitude of the friction force, yet its time evolution in rough viscoelastic interfaces remains incompletely understood. In experiments of contact between polymethylmethacrylate blocks under decreasing normal loads, Dillavou and Rubinstein have shown that the true contact area exhibits, after unloading, a decreasing phase and long-term memory of the contact state prior to unloading. It is however unclear what modeling ingredients are necessary to reproduce these two features. Here, we investigate these effects using fractional viscoelastic rough contact models. By adapting existing contact theories and numerical simulation methods to fractional viscoelasticity, which induces a wide relaxation spectrum, we reproduce logarithmic aging under constant load, but show that memory of the contact state is erased upon unloading. Indeed, the contact area behaves as if it had always experienced the reduced load, even on short time-scales, contrasting with the response of a standard linear solid. Moreover, none of our results show a decreasing regime of the contact area after unload: we ultimately prove that this is the case for all linear viscoelastic models -- despite capturing logarithmic aging -- leading to the conclusion that additional local internal variables are required to explain both long-term contact memory and contact area reduction after unloading.

Title: Learning Degenerate Manifolds of Frustrated Magnets with Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Ho Jang, Jackson C. Glass, Gia-Wei Chern
Abstract: We show that Restricted Boltzmann Machines (RBMs) provide a flexible generative framework for modeling spin configurations in disordered yet strongly correlated phases of frustrated magnets. As a benchmark, we first demonstrate that an RBM can learn the zero-temperature ground-state manifold of the one-dimensional ANNNI model at its multiphase point, accurately reproducing its characteristic oscillatory and exponentially decaying correlations. We then apply RBMs to kagome spin ice and show that they successfully learn the local ice rules and short-range correlations of the extensively degenerate ice-I manifold. Correlation functions computed from RBM-generated configurations closely match those from direct Monte Carlo simulations. For the partially ordered ice-II phase -- featuring long-range charge order and broken time-reversal symmetry -- accurate modeling requires RBMs with uniform-sign bias fields, mirroring the underlying symmetry breaking. These results highlight the utility of RBMs as generative models for learning constrained and highly frustrated magnetic states.

Title: Resistance of refractory high-entropy alloys to ultrafast laser irradiation
Authors: Nikita Medvedev
Abstract: Response of refractory high-entropy alloys MoNbTaVW and HfNbTaTiZr to ultrafast laser radiation is modelled with the hybrid code XTANT-3, combining tight-binding molecular dynamics with the transport Monte Carlo and Boltzmann equation. A two-temperature state with elevated electronic temperature and a cold atomic lattice is studied. The parameters of the electronic system in such a state are evaluated: electronic heat capacity, thermal conductivity, and electron-phonon coupling parameter with the electronic temperatures up to ~25,000 K. It is also demonstrated that the two refractory alloys do not show signs of nonthermal melting up to the deposited doses of ~10 eV/atom, making them more radiation resistant than the Cantor alloy or stainless steel. These results suggest that heavy-element high-entropy alloys are more radiation resistant than those containing only lighter elements. Damage in irradiated HfNbTaTiZr starts with the selective diffusion of Ti atoms, forming a transient superionic-like state.

Title: Measuring the buried interphase between solid electrolytes and lithium metal using neutrons
Authors: Andrew S. Westover, Katie L. Browning, Antonino Cannavo, Ralph Gilles, Jiri Vacik, James F. Browning, Neelima Paul, Giovanni Ceccio, Vasyl Lavrentiev
Abstract: Interfaces are the key to next generation high energy batteries including solid state Li metal batteries. In solid state batteries, the buried nature of solid solid electrolyte electrode interfaces makes studying them difficult. Neutrons have significant potential to non destructively probe these buried solid solid interfaces. This work presents a comparative study using both neutron depth profiling (NDP) and neutron reflectometry (NR) to study a model lithium metal-lithium phosphorus oxynitride (LiPON) solid electrolyte system. In the NDP data, no distinct interphase is observed at the interface. NR shows a difference between electrodeposited, and vapor deposited LiPON -Li interfaces but finds both are gradient interphases that are less than 30 nm thick. Additional simulations of the LiPON-Li2O-Li system demonstrate that NDP has an excellent resolution in the 50 nm-1 mm regime while NR has an ideal resolution from 0.1 - 200 nm with different sample requirements. Together NDP and NR can provide a complementary understanding of interfaces between Li metal and solid electrolytes across relevant length scales.

Title: Phase transitions in time complexity of Brownian circuits
Authors: Kota Okajima, Koji Hukushima
Abstract: Brownian circuits perform computations using stochastic transitions driven by thermal fluctuations. While the energetic costs of such fluctuation-driven computation have been extensively studied within stochastic thermodynamics, much less is known about its computational complexity, in particular, how computation time scales with circuit size. In this work, the computation time for explicitly designed Brownian circuits is numerically investigated via the first-passage time to a completed state. For arithmetic circuits such as adders, varying the forward transition rate induces a sharp change in the scaling behavior of the mean computation time with circuit size, from linear to exponential. This change can be interpreted as an easy-hard transition in computational time complexity. The transition suggests that, for meaningful computational tasks, achieving efficient polynomial-time computation generally requires a finite forward bias corresponding to a nonzero energy input. As a counterexample, we show that arbitrary logical operations can be reduced to an effective one-dimensional stochastic process in which the zero-bias limit lies within the computationally efficient (easy) regime. However, achieving such a one-dimensional normal form unavoidably leads to an exponential increase in circuit size. These results reveal a fundamental trade-off between computation time, circuit size, and energy input in Brownian circuits and demonstrate that phase transitions in time complexity provide a natural framework for characterizing the cost of fluctuation-driven computation.

Title: K-ion intercalation memristors in prussian blue analogs revealed by C-AFM for Non-Volatile memory and Neuromorphic Computing

Abstract: K-ion intercalation in Prussian blue analogs (PBAs) is a well-established charge storage mechanism in potassium-ion batteries; here, we demonstrate that this same ion intercalation process is the basis for nanoscale resistive switching behavior in PBA-base memristive devices. Using C-AFM, we directly visualize and electrically control this intercalation process within sub-100 nm volumes, revealing reversible, localized conductance modulation driven by K-ion intercalation and Fe^(2+)/Fe^(3+) redox reconfiguration. This nanoscale operability highlights the exceptional potential of PBAs for high-scalable and low-dimension memristor-based devices integration. Due to their modular composition, PBAs constitute a chemically rich, earth-abundant materials platform whose electronic and ionic properties can be precisely tuned for specific device functions. K-ion intercalation PBA-based memristor devices, with their single-step, aqueous, and room-temperature fabrication, enable low-cost, large-scale processing compatible with CMOS, without any additional post-fabrication processing. Our findings establish PBAs as a new class of intercalation memristors with scalable nanoscale switching and exceptional materials versatility, toward highly integrated neuromorphic and non-volatile memory technologies. This work provides the first demonstration of intercalation-driven resistive switching under ultrafast voltage sweeps, with PW operating up to 200 V/s and PB up to 50 V/s. This unprecedented speed establishes PBAs as a distinct, high-rate class of K-ion intercalation memristors suitable for fast, high-density neuromorphic and memory applications.

Title: Primary charge-4e superconductivity from doping a featureless Mott insulator
Authors: Zhi-Qiang Gao, Yan-Qi Wang, Ya-Hui Zhang, Hui Yang
Abstract: Superconductivity is usually understood as a phase in which charge-$2e$ Cooper pairs are condensed. Charge-$4e$ superconductivity has largely been discussed as a vestigial order at finite temperature emerging from charge-$2e$ states. Primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phases at zero temperature remain scarce in both experiments and microscopic models. Here we argue that a doped featureless Mott insulator with $SU(4)$ symmetry provides a natural platform for primary charge-$4e$ superconductivity, based on perturbative renormalization group arguments and group theoretic considerations. As a concrete realization, we construct a bilayer Hubbard model with tunable onsite $SU(4)$ and $Sp(4)$ symmetries that exhibits a featureless Mott insulating phase at half filling. Its low energy physics is captured by a generalized ESD model, featuring an effective Hamiltonian that is purely kinetic within the constrained Hilbert space. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find a primary charge-$4e$ superconducting phase in the $SU(4)$ ESD model and a conventional primary charge-$2e$ phase in the $Sp(4)$ case. We further characterize the corresponding normal states and discuss the resulting finite temperature phase diagram.

Title: Questioning van der Waals Epitaxy of Non-Layered Materials on Mica: The Case of ScN
Authors: Susmita Chowdhury, Faezeh Alijan Farzad Lahiji, Mikael Ottoson, Olivier Donzel-Gargand, Robert J. W. Frost, Martin Magnuson, Ganpati Ramanath, Arnaud le Febvrier, Per Eklund
Abstract: Growing stress-free epitaxial films by van der Waals epitaxy (vdWE) is of interest for realizing flexible optoelectronics and energy devices from freestanding epilayers. However, vdWE of non-layered materials is often presumed or claimed on layered substrates such as mica with inadequate experimental evidence. Here, we demonstrate that the growth of single-domain rocksalt ScN(111) films by sputter deposition on fluorophlogopite mica(001) occurs by conventional epitaxy. X-ray diffraction and electron microscopy reveal the film/substrate epitaxial relationship to be [-101](111)ScN||[010](001)mica. Our results indicating strain buildup seen from the dependence of (111) interplanar spacings, and strain relaxation by dislocation generation, question prior claims of vdWE of non-layered metal nitrides on mica. Our findings show that conventional epitaxy should be the default assumption for non-layered materials unless conditions for vdWE are explicitly established.

Title: Giant bubbles of Fisher zeros in the quantum XY chain
Authors: Songtai Lv, Yang Liu, Erhai Zhao, Haiyuan Zou, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We demonstrate an alternative approach based on complex-valued inverse temperature and partition function to probe quantum phases of matter with nontrivial spectra and dynamics. It leverages thermofield dynamics (TFD) to quantitatively characterize quantum and thermal fluctuations, and exploit the correspondence between low-energy excitations and Fisher zeros. Using the quantum XY chain in an external field as a testbed, we show that the oscillatory gap behavior manifests as oscillations in the long-time dynamics of the TFD spectral form factor. We also identify giant bubbles, i.e. large-scale closed lines, of Fisher-zeros near the gapless XX limit. They provide a characteristic energy scale that seems to contradict the predictions of the low energy theory of a featureless Luttinger liquid. We identify this energy scale and relate the motion of these giant bubbles with varying external field to the transfer of spectral weight from high to low energies. The deep connection between Fisher zeros, dynamics, and excitations opens up promising avenues for understanding the unconventional gap behaviors in strongly correlated many-body systems.

Title: Universal electrical transport of composite Fermi liquid to Metal transition in Moiré systems
Authors: Youxuan Wang, Rongning Liu, Feng Liu, Xueyang Song
Abstract: We compute universal electrical transport near continuous transitions between a composite Fermi liquid (CFL) and a metallic phase in moire Chern bands, focusing on fillings $\nu=-1/2$ and $\nu=-3/4$. The critical theory represents a novel QED-Chern-Simons framework: a charged sector at a bosonic Laughlin-superfluid critical point is coupled, via emergent gauge fields and Chern-Simons mixing, to a neutral spinon Fermi surface. Integrating out matter fields to quadratic order yields an explicit Ioffe-Larkin composition rule for the full resistivity tensor, showing how longitudinal channels add in series while Chern-Simons terms generate Hall response. To obtain the DC limit in the quantum critical fan, we develop a controlled large-N expansion where both fermion flavors and Chern-Simons levels scale with $N$, and solve a quantum Boltzmann equation at leading nontrivial order $1/N$. Gauge-mediated inelastic scattering removes the collisionless Drude singularity and produces a universal scaling function $\Sigma(\omega/T)$ and finite DC conductivities $\sigma(0) \approx 0.033 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-1/2$) and $0.047 e^2/\hbar$ ($\nu=-3/4$). We also identify a Chern-Simons "filtering" mechanism that suppresses transmission of Landau damping from the spinon Fermi surface to the critical gauge mode. Our approach provides concrete transport diagnostics for detecting quantum criticality in moire superlattices.

Title: Stability of Bose-Fermi mixtures in two dimensions: a lowest-order constrained variational approach
Authors: Pietro Cordioli, Leonardo Pisani, Pierbiagio Pieri
Abstract: We investigate the problem of mechanical stability in two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures at zero temperature, focusing on systems with a tunable Bose-Fermi (BF) interaction and a weak but finite boson-boson (BB) repulsion. The analysis is carried out within the framework of the lowest-order constrained variational (LOCV) approach, which allows for a non-perturbative treatment of strong interspecies correlations while retaining analytical transparency. The BF interaction is modeled by a properly regularized attractive contact potential, enabling the exploration of both the attractive and repulsive energy branches. We determine the minimal BB repulsion required to ensure mechanical stability of the mixture by evaluating the inverse compressibility matrix over the full range of BF coupling strengths, within the domain of validity of the LOCV approximation. The interaction contribution to the energy is benchmarked against available experimental data and Quantum Monte Carlo results in the single-impurity limit, showing good agreement. Our analysis reveals how the critical BB coupling depends on interaction strength, density imbalance, and mass ratio. In particular, we find that mixtures with equal boson and fermion masses exhibit enhanced stability, requiring the smallest BB repulsion to prevent mechanical instability. In this case, a relatively small BB interaction is sufficient to stabilize attractive mixtures for all values of the BF interaction. These results provide a theoretical framework for assessing stability conditions in experimentally realizable two-dimensional Bose-Fermi mixtures with tunable interactions.

Title: Flexoelectricity-driven softening of bend elasticity leads to spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in a polar fluid
Authors: Aitor Erkoreka, Josu Martinez-Perdiguero, Luka Cmok, Ema Hanžel, Jordan Hobbs, Calum J. Gibb, Richard J. Mandle, Nerea Sebastián, Alenka Mertelj
Abstract: The origin of recently observed spontaneous chiral symmetry breaking in polar fluids is an unsolved problem, and poses fundamental questions as to how heliconical structures emerge in systems composed of achiral molecules. We report on the softening of bend elasticity close to such phase transition, showing that flexoelectric coupling between the electric polarization and the bend deformation is the responsible mechanism, presumably arising from the bent shape of the constituent highly polar molecules.

Title: Columnar order in random packings of $2\times2$ squares on the square lattice
Authors: Daniel Hadas, Ron Peled
Abstract: We study random packings of $2\times2$ squares with centers on the square lattice $\mathbb{Z}^{2}$, in which the probability of a packing is proportional to $\lambda$ to the number of squares. We prove that for large $\lambda$, typical packings exhibit columnar order, in which either the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $x$-coordinate or the centers of most tiles agree on the parity of their $y$-coordinate. This manifests in the existence of four extremal and periodic Gibbs measures in which the rotational symmetry of the lattice is broken while the translational symmetry is only broken along a single axis. We further quantify the decay of correlations in these measures, obtaining a slow rate of exponential decay in the direction of preserved translational symmetry and a fast rate in the direction of broken translational symmetry. Lastly, we prove that every periodic Gibbs measure is a mixture of these four measures. Additionally, our proof introduces an apparently novel extension of the chessboard estimate, from finite-volume torus measures to all infinite-volume periodic Gibbs measures.

Title: The Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation
Authors: Bernardo Barrera, Daniel P. Arovas, Anushya Chandran, Anatoli Polkovnikov
Abstract: We develop a mixed quantum-classical framework, dubbed the Moving Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (MBOA), to describe the dynamics of slow degrees of freedom (DOFs) coupled to fast ones. As in the Born-Oppenheimer Approximation (BOA), the fast degrees of freedom adiabatically follow a state that depends on the slow ones. Unlike the BOA, this state depends on both the positions and the momenta of the slow DOFs. We study several model systems: a spin-1/2 particle and a spinful molecule moving in a spatially inhomogeneous magnetic field, and a gas of fast particles coupled to a piston. The MBOA reveals rich dynamics for the slow degree of freedom, including reflection, dynamical trapping, and mass renormalization. It also significantly modifies the state of the fast DOFs. For example, the spins in the molecule are entangled and squeezed, while the gas of fast particles develops gradients that are synchronized with the motion of the piston for a long time. The MBOA can be used to describe both classical and quantum systems and has potential applications in quantum chemistry, correlated materials, atomic physics, molecular dynamics, and quantum sensing.

Title: The canonical ensemble of a self-gravitating matter thin shell in AdS
Authors: Tiago V. Fernandes, Francisco J. Gandum, José P. S. Lemos
Abstract: We build the canonical ensemble of a hot self-gravitating matter thin shell in anti-de Sitter (AdS) space by finding its partition function through the Euclidean path integral approach with fixed temperature at the conformal boundary. We obtain the reduced action of the system by restricting the path integral to spherically symmetric metrics with given boundary conditions and with the Hamiltonian constraint satisfied. The stationary conditions, i.e., the mechanical equilibrium and the thermodynamic equilibrium, are obtained from minimizing the reduced action. Evaluating the perturbed reduced action at the stationary points yields the mechanical stability condition and the thermodynamic stability condition. The reduced action calculated at the stationary points gives the partition function in the zero-loop approximation and from it the thermodynamic properties of the system are acquired. Within thermodynamics alone, the only stability condition that one can establish is thermodynamic stability, which follows from the computation of the heat capacity. For given specific pressure and temperature equations of state for the shell, we obtain the solutions of the ensemble. There are four different thin shell solutions, one of them is fully stable, i.e., is stable mechanically and thermodynamically. For the equations of state given, we find a first order phase transition from the matter thermodynamic phase to the Hawking-Page black hole phase. Moreover, there is a maximum temperature above which the shell ceases to exist, presumably at these high temperatures the shell inevitably collapses to a black hole.

Title: Functional bottlenecks can emerge from non-epistatic underlying traits
Authors: Anna Ottavia Schulte, Samar Alqatari, Saverio Rossi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Protein fitness landscapes frequently exhibit epistasis, where the effect of a mutation depends on the genetic context in which it occurs, i.e., the rest of the protein sequence. Epistasis increases landscape complexity, often resulting in multiple fitness peaks. In its simplest form, known as global epistasis, fitness is modeled as a non-linear function of an underlying additive trait. In contrast, more complex epistasis arises from a network of (pairwise or many-body) interactions between residues, which cannot be removed by a single non-linear transformation. Recent studies have explored how global and network epistasis contribute to the emergence of functional bottlenecks - fitness landscape topologies where two broad high-fitness basins, representing distinct phenotypes, are separated by a bottleneck that can only be crossed via one or a few mutational paths. Here, we introduce and analyze a stylized model of global epistasis with an additive underlying trait. We demonstrate that functional bottlenecks arise with high probability if the model is properly calibrated. Furthermore, our results underscore that a proper balance between neutral and non-neutral mutations is needed for the emergence of functional bottlenecks.

Title: Diffusion Codes: Self-Correction from Small(er)-Set Expansion with Tunable Non-locality
Authors: Adithya Sriram, Vedika Khemani, Benedikt Placke
Abstract: Optimal constructions of classical LDPC codes can be obtained by choosing the Tanner graph uniformly at random among biregular graphs. We introduce a class of codes that we call ``diffusion codes'', defined by placing each edge connecting bits and checks on some graph, and acting on that graph with a random SWAP network. By tuning the depth of the SWAP network, we can tune a tradeoff between the amount of randomness -- and hence the optimality of code parameters -- and locality with respect to the underlying graph. For diffusion codes defined on the cycle graph, if the SWAP network has depth $\sim Tn$ with $T> n^{2\beta}$ for arbitrary $\beta>0$, then we prove that almost surely the Tanner graph is a lossless ``smaller set'' vertex expander for small sets up size $\delta \sim \sqrt T \sim n^{\beta}$, with bounded bit and check degree. At the same time, the geometric size of the largest stabilizer is bounded by $\sqrt T$ in graph distance. We argue, based on physical intuition, that this result should hold more generally on arbitrary graphs. By taking hypergraph products of these classical codes we obtain quantum LDPC codes defined on the torus with smaller-set boundary and co-boundary expansion and the same expansion/locality tradeoffs as for the classical codes. These codes are self-correcting and admit single-shot decoding, while having the geometric size of the stabilizer growing as an arbitrarily small power law. Our proof technique establishes mixing of a random SWAP network on small subsystems at times scaling with only the subsystem size, which may be of independent interest.

Title: Many-body post-processing of density functional calculations using the variational quantum eigensolver for Bader charge analysis
Authors: Erik Schultheis, Alexander Rehn, Gabriel Breuil
Abstract: Quantum chemistry and condensed matter physics are among the most promising applications of quantum computers. Further, estimating properties of a material is crucial to evaluate its industrial applications. To investigate charge distributions of weakly and strongly correlated systems we calculate Bader charges for various periodic systems by solving many-body Hamiltonians using the variational quantum eigensolver. The Hamiltonians are computed from Kohn-Sham orbitals obtained from a prior DFT calculation. We first demonstrate the accuracy of our method on various doped MgH2 supercells. Further, we show that our approach, compared to standard DFT, significantly improves the Bader charge values for strongly correlated transition metal oxides, where we take DFT+U results as a reference. The computational framework behind our many-body calculations, called Dopyqo, is made openly available as a software package.

The measurements are designed in a way that the underlying graph of interactions is a random graph. The setup will be useful in cases where a substantial amount of data is missing, as in completion of relatively high rank matrices for recommendation systems heavily used in social network services. In order to obtain theoretical insights on the setup, we consider statistical inference of the tensor factorization in a high dimensional limit, which we call as dense limit, where the graphs are large and dense but not fully connected. We build message-passing algorithms and test them in a Bayes optimal teacher-student setting in some specific cases. We also develop a replica theory to examine the performance of statistical inference in the dense limit based on a cumulant expansion. The latter approach allows one to avoid blind usage of Gaussian ansatz which fails in some fully connected systems.

Title: A Self Propelled Vortex Dipole Model on Surfaces of Variable Negative Curvature
Authors: Khushi Banthia, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate vortex dipoles on surfaces of variable negative curvature, focusing on a catenoid of arbitrary throat radius as a concrete example. We construct the effective dynamical system including mutual and geometric self-interaction terms and show that the resulting Hamiltonian dynamics makes dipoles follow catenoid geodesics, in agreement with recent works, Gustafsson (J. Nonlinear Sci. 32, 62, 2022) and by Drivas, Glukhovskiy and Khesin (Int. Math. Res. Not. 2024, 14, 10880-10894). We utilize the symplectic structure to find a conserved momentum map J related to the U(1) symmetry along the azimuthal direction. We verify the conservation of both the Hamiltonian and this momentum for arbitrary throat radius. We then demonstrate direct and exchange scattering of classical vortices on the catenoid, and we contrast this with the collective rotational motion (with azimuthal drift) that arises for chiral pairs. Finally, we build a finite-dipole dynamical system on the catenoid and show that the self-propulsion terms emerge to leading order in the dipole size. This provides a concrete realization, on a curved minimal surface, of the intuitive statement that a finite dipole propels orthogonal to the dipole axis, with a speed modulated by curvature.

Title: atomSmltr: a modular Python package to simulate laser cooling setups
Authors: Mateo Weill (1 and 2), Andrea Bertoldi (2), Alexandre Dareau (1 and 2) ((1) Institut d'Optique, Talence, France, (2) IOGS, LP2N, Université Bordeaux, CNRS, UMR 5298, Talence, France)
Abstract: We introduce atomSmltr, a Python package for simulating laser cooling in complex magnetic field and laser beams geometries. The package features a modular design that enables users to easily construct experimental setups, including magnetic fields, laser beams and other environment components, and to perform a range of simulations within these configurations. We present the overall architecture of atomSmltr and illustrate its capabilities through a series of examples, including benchmarks against standard textbook cases in laser cooling.

Title: Spacetime Spins: Statistical mechanics for error correction with stabilizer circuits
Authors: Cory T. Aitchison, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: A powerful method for analyzing quantum error-correcting codes is to map them onto classical statistical mechanics models. Such mappings have thus far mostly focused on static codes, possibly subject to repeated syndrome measurements. Recent progress in quantum error correction, however, has prompted new paradigms where codes emerge from stabilizer circuits in spacetime -- a unifying perspective encompassing syndrome extraction circuits of static codes, dynamically generated codes, and logical operations. We show how to construct statistical mechanical models for stabilizer circuits subject to independent Pauli errors, by mapping logical equivalence class probabilities of errors to partition functions using the spacetime subsystem code formalism. We also introduce a modular language of spin diagrams for constructing the spin Hamiltonians, which we describe in detail focusing on independent circuit-level X-Z error channels. With the repetition and toric codes as examples, we use our approach to analytically rank logical error rates and thresholds between code implementations with standard and dynamic syndrome extraction circuits, describe the effect of transversal logical Clifford gates on logical error rates, and perform Monte Carlo simulations to estimate maximum likelihood thresholds. Our framework offers a universal prescription to analyze, simulate, and compare the decoding properties of any stabilizer circuit, while revealing the innate connections between dynamical quantum systems and noise-resilient phases of matter.

Title: Universal Predictors for Mixing Time more than Liouvillian Gap
Authors: Yi-Neng Zhou
Abstract: We analyze the mixing time of open quantum systems governed by the Lindblad master equation, showing it is not only determined by the Liouvillian gap, but also the trace norm of the lowest excited state of Liouvillian superoperator. By utilizing these universal predictors of mixing time, we establish general conditions for the fast and rapid mixing respectively. Specifically, we derive rapid mixing conditions for both the strong and weak dissipation regimes, formulated as sparsity constraints on the Hamiltonian and the local Lindblad operators. Our findings provide a general framework for calculating mixing time and offer a guide for designing dissipation to achieve desired mixing speeds, which has significant implications for efficient experimental state preparation.

Title: Failure of the mean-field Hartree approximation for a bosonic many-body system with non-Hermitian Hamiltonian
Authors: Matias Ginzburg, Simone Rademacher, Giacomo De Palma
Abstract: Mean-field Hartree theory is a central tool for reducing interacting many-body dynamics to an effective nonlinear one-particle evolution. This approximation has been employed also when the Hamiltonian that governs the many-body dynamics is not Hermitian. Indeed, non-Hermitian Hamiltonians model particle gain/loss or the evolution of open quantum systems between consecutive quantum jumps. Furthermore, the validity of the Hartree approximation for generic non-Hermitian Hamiltonians lies at the basis of a quantum algorithm for nonlinear differential equations. In this work, we show that this approximation can fail. We analytically solve a model of $N$ bosonic qubits with two-body interactions generated by a purely anti-Hermitian Hamiltonian, determine an analytic expression for the limit for $N\to\infty$ of the one-particle marginal state and show that such a limit does not agree with the solution of the non-Hermitian Hartree evolution equation. We further show that there exists an initial condition such that the exact one-particle marginal state undergoes a finite-time transition to a mixed state, a phenomenon that is completely absent in the case of Hermitian Hamiltonians. Our findings challenge the validity of the mean-field Hartree approximation for non-Hermitian Hamiltonians, and call for additional conditions for the validity of the mean-field regime to model the dynamics of particle gain and loss and the open-system dynamics in bosonic many-body systems.

Title: Tunable many-body burst in isolated quantum systems
Authors: Shozo Yamada, Akihiro Hokkyo, Masahito Ueda
Abstract: Thermalization in isolated quantum many-body systems can be nonmonotonic, with its process dependent on an initial state. We propose a numerical method to construct a low-entangled initial state that creates a "burst" -- a transient deviation of an observable from its thermal equilibrium value -- at a designated time. We apply this method to demonstrate that a burst of magnetization can be realized for a nonintegrable mixed-field Ising chain on a timescale comparable to the onset of quantum scrambling. Contrary to the typical spreading of information in this regime, the created burst is accompanied by a slow or even negative entanglement growth. Analytically, we show that a burst becomes probabilistically rare after a long time. Our results suggest that a nonequilibrium state is maintained for an appropriately chosen initial state until scrambling becomes dominant. These predictions can be tested with programmable quantum simulators.

Title: A dialog between cell adhesion and topology at the core of morphogenesis
Authors: Adrian Aguirre-Tamaral, Elisa Floris, Bernat Corominas-Murtra
Abstract: During the development of an organism, cells must coordinate and organize to generate the correct shape, structure, and spatial patterns of tissues and organs, a process known as morphogenesis. The morphogenesis of embryonic tissues is supported by multiple processes that induce the precise physical deformations required for tissues to ultimately form organs with complex geometries. Among the most active players shaping the morphogenetic path are fine-tuned changes in cell adhesion. We review here recent advances showing that changes of a local, pair-wise property defined at the cell-cell contact level has important global consequences for embryonic tissue topology, being determinant in defining both the geometric and material properties of early embryo tissues.

Title: Dirac mode localization in QCD near the crossover temperature
Authors: Matteo Giordano, Tamas G. Kovacs, Ferenc Pittler
Abstract: We study the localization properties of the low-lying Dirac eigenmodes in QCD near the crossover temperature, using staggered fermions on the lattice. We find that localized low modes, absent at low temperature, appear at a temperature $T_{\mathrm{loc}}$ in the range $155\,\mathrm{MeV}\le T_{\mathrm{loc}}\le 158\,\mathrm{MeV}$, in excellent agreement with the pseudocritical crossover temperature as determined from the chiral condensate and from the light-quark susceptibility.

Title: Semantic Chunking and the Entropy of Natural Language
Authors: Weishun Zhong, Doron Sivan, Tankut Can, Mikhail Katkov, Misha Tsodyks
Abstract: The entropy rate of printed English is famously estimated to be about one bit per character, a benchmark that modern large language models (LLMs) have only recently approached. This entropy rate implies that English contains nearly 80 percent redundancy relative to the five bits per character expected for random text. We introduce a statistical model that attempts to capture the intricate multi-scale structure of natural language, providing a first-principles account of this redundancy level. Our model describes a procedure of self-similarly segmenting text into semantically coherent chunks down to the single-word level. The semantic structure of the text can then be hierarchically decomposed, allowing for analytical treatment. Numerical experiments with modern LLMs and open datasets suggest that our model quantitatively captures the structure of real texts at different levels of the semantic hierarchy. The entropy rate predicted by our model agrees with the estimated entropy rate of printed English. Moreover, our theory further reveals that the entropy rate of natural language is not fixed but should increase systematically with the semantic complexity of corpora, which are captured by the only free parameter in our model.
