Title: Thermodynamics of dilute anyon gases from fusion constraints
Authors: Yuto Nakajima, Umang Mehta, Hart Goldman
Abstract: Recent measurements on 2d materials tuning between fractional quantum anomalous Hall phases and a plethora of correlated electronic states call for a detailed understanding of the dynamics of anyons. Here we develop a general theory of the statistical mechanics of anyon gases at finite temperature, valid in regimes where the anyons are sufficiently dilute and can be treated as weakly interacting particles. We find that with a minimal set of universal braiding and fusion data, along with information about the hierarchy of anyon gaps, it is possible to construct a distribution function for any dilute anyon gas, as well as derive thermodynamic observables. Our results are built on an anyon exclusion principle manifesting as a constraint on fusion outcomes of physical states. Our approach unifies and streamlines a range of results for itinerant anyon models, from solvable lattice Hamiltonians to large-N field theories.

Title: Superdielectrics: Disorder-induced perfect screening in insulators
Authors: Ilia Komissarov, Tobias Holder, Raquel Queiroz
Abstract: We study the relationship between the quantities that encode the insulating properties of matter: the ground-state quantum metric, the average localization length, and the electric susceptibility. By examining the one-dimensional Anderson insulator model and the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger chain with chiral disorder, we demonstrate that the former two measures are proportional in one-dimensional systems near criticality, and both are determined by the properties of the hybridized localized states around the Fermi energy. We employ these insights to demonstrate that the behavior of the electric susceptibility is drastically different in the bond-disordered SSH chain, with the possibility that it may diverge even when the localization length and the quantum metric remain finite. This divergence, caused by the proliferation of impurity resonances at a particular energy, leads to a novel regime that exhibits mixed characteristics of metals and insulators. We term this regime superdielectric: an insulating state characterized by a finite quantum metric and divergent static electric susceptibility, which implies perfect screening in the absence of the dc conductivity. We demonstrate that the superdielectric phase also emerges in higher-dimensional materials, such as graphene with vacancies and Kekulé bond distortion.

Title: The beginning of the endpoint bootstrap for conformal line defects
Authors: Ryan A. Lanzetta, Shang Liu, Max A. Metlitski
Abstract: A challenge in the study of conformal field theory (CFT) is to characterize the possible defects in specific bulk CFTs. Given the success of numerical bootstrap techniques applied to the characterization of bulk CFTs, it is desirable to develop similar tools to study conformal defects. In this work, we successfully demonstrate this possibility for endable conformal line defects. We achieve this by incorporating the endpoints of a conformal line defect into the numerical four-point bootstrap and exploit novel crossing symmetry relations that mix bulk and defect CFT data in a way that further possesses positivity, so that rigorous numerical bootstrap techniques are applicable. We implement this approach for the pinning field line defect of the $3d$ Ising CFT, obtaining estimates of its defect CFT data that agree well with other recent estimates, particularly those obtained via the fuzzy sphere regularization. An interesting consequence of our bounds is nearly rigorous evidence that the $\mathbb Z_2$-symmetric defect exhibiting long range order obtained as a direct sum of two conjugate pinning field defects is unstable to domain wall proliferation.

Title: Beyond Superexchange: Emergent Unconventional Ferromagnetism in Thin-Film Sandwich Structures of Intrinsic Magnetic Topological Insulators
Authors: Takuya Takashiro, Ryota Akiyama, Ryotaro Minakawa, Shuji Hasegawa
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the nature of magnetic interactions in intrinsic magnetic topological insulator Mn(Bi1-xSbx)2Te4 (MBST in short) systems, which possesses highly-ordered ferromagnetic septuple-layers (SLs), using two types of structures: MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3 heterostructures and MBST(1 SL)/(Bi1-xSbx)2Te3/MBST(1 SL) sandwich structures. The out-of-plane magnetization in the sandwich structure turned out to be significantly larger than that in the heterostructure, indicating that the interlayer magnetic interaction between two MBST layers is ferromagnetic. Furthermore, the Curie temperature increased with decreasing the in-plane Mn-Mn distance in the MBST layer, which suggests the enhancement of the intralayer ferromagnetic interaction within each MBST layer. Meanwhile, in the sandwich structures with various spacer thicknesses, the Curie temperature with the spacer layer was higher than that with no spacer layer. In addition, the curve shape of anomalous Hall effects for the sandwich structure was almost unchanged by carrier-density modulation, which implies that the ferromagnetism in this system is carrier-independent. Based on the above results, magnetic behaviors in our systems cannot be explained only by the direct exchange nor superexchange interactions reported previously for MBST systems, and are instead proposed to arise from topology-related mechanisms such as the van Vleck and Bloembergen-Rowland mechanisms. This work provides a new perspective on magnetic mechanisms in MBST systems, which helps us to realize next-generation spintronic and electronic devices by flexibly controlling magnetism in intrinsic magnetic topological insulators.

Title: Probing Magnetic Properties of RuO$_{2}$ Heterostructures Through the Ferromagnetic Layer
Authors: Frank M. Abel, Subhash Bhatt, Shelby S. Fields, Vinay Sharma, Dai Q. Ho, Daniel Wines, D. Quang To, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Tehseen Adel, Riccardo Torsi, Maria F. Munoz, David T. Plouff, Xinhao Wang, Brian Donovan, Don Heiman, Gregory M. Stephen, Adam L. Friedman, Garnett W. Bryant, Anderson Janotti, Michelle E. Jamer, Angela R. Hight Walker, John Q. Xiao, Steven P. Bennett
Abstract: RuO$_{2}$ has been proposed as the prototypical altermagnetic material. However, several reports have recently questioned its intrinsic magnetic ordering, leading to conflicting findings, especially in thin film heterostructures pointing to possible interface effects being convoluted with supposed antiferromagnetic/altermagnetic signatures. Here, extensive magnetometry measurements were performed on two independently grown thin film heterostructures of RuO$_{2}$ interfaced with either NiFe or Fe acting as the ferromagnetic layer. Below about 15 K, both samples exhibit exchange bias fields when cooled to approximately 2 K in a $+$1 T field, and a spin transitional feature is observed around 31 K. Magneto-Raman measurements on RuO$_{2}$ thin films only reveal a magnon mode when there is a NiFe layer, suggesting that RuO$_{2}$ does not intrinsically possess long range magnetic ordering.. When in contact with a ferromagnet, RuO$_2$ displays effects that could be ascribed to antiferromagnetism. However, the lack of intrinsic magnon modes points toward possible diffusion between the layers or spin disorder at the interface as seen by density functional theory (DFT) calculations.

Title: Intermediate-temperature specific heat of solids and the rationale behind the Maier-Kelley empirical formula
Authors: Valmir Ribeiro, Fernando Parisio
Abstract: The heat capacity of solids at intermediate-to-high temperatures is of fundamental importance to several fields ranging from geology to material science. It depends on a variety of factors, with anharmonicity and, ultimately, melting playing a pivotal role. In this work we develop a first-principles model from an analytically tractable semi-harmonic oscillator Hamiltonian. The resulting specific heat expression depends not only on the Einstein temperature of the material but also on other physical parameters. We compare our predictions with experimental data for copper, aluminum, lead, silicon, and germanium with rather satisfactory results, especially considering that there are no fitting parameters in our theory. We finish this work by showing that our results formally justify the otherwise purely empirical formula by Maier and Kelley, also providing its coefficients in terms of elementary physical quantities.

Title: Disordered origins, deterministic outcomes: How the architecture of elastic networks imprints relaxed structure and mechanics
Authors: Stefanie Heyden, Mohit Pundir, Eric R. Dufresne, David S. Kammer
Abstract: This work targets the influence of disorder on the relaxed structure and macroscopic mechanical properties of elastic networks. We construct network classes of different types of disorder (length, topology and stiffness), which are subsequently equilibrated in a finite kinematics setting. Relaxed network structures are distinct among network classes, which opens the path towards exploiting easily accessible experimental measures as a way of inferring further microstructural details.

Title: Polarization Mechanism of Bacteria Motion in Aquatic Media
Authors: Bohdan Lev (1, 2 and 3), Oleksandr Cherniak (1) ((1) Bogolyubov Institute for Theoretical Physics of NAS of Ukraine (2) Jozef Stefan Institute and (3) University of Ljubljana)
Abstract: A new model of light-induced bacteria motion in an aqueous medium is proposed. The model concerns bacteria both with and without flagellae. It is based on the hydrodynamics of active matter and allows for the changes of polarization of both bacteria and the medium. Natural light is assumed to intensify the motion of clusters with different refraction indices within the bacteria and to modify their polarization. Such motion of polarized globules causes an increase in deformations and inhomogeneous polarization distribution on the bacteria surfaces. The free energy functional is used to calculate the perturbation of the bacteria surfaces and inhomogeneous polarization distributions that may either move along the bacteria or rotate. Mechanical interaction of surface deformations with water flows or interaction of the inhomogeneous polarization with free charges causes bacteria motion in the medium. Estimates of the bacteria motion velocity in the case of the proposed mechanism are made and it corresponded to experimentally observed values.

Title: Entropy-Seebeck ratio as a tool for elementary charge determination
Authors: Francisco J. Peña, Cesar Nuñez, Bastian Castorene, Michel Aguilera, Natalia Cortés, Patricio Vargas
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the relationship between the Seebeck coefficient $(S)$, and the differential entropy per particle (DEP, $s$), as a tool for characterizing charge carriers in two-dimensional systems. Using armchair silicene nanoribbons as a model platform, we analyze how both quantities and their ratio depend on chemical potential at room temperature. While the Seebeck coefficient captures transport properties through the energy dependence of the electronic transmission, the DEP is directly connected to the system's electronic entropy, offering a direct thermodynamic alternative for estimating $S$. We evaluate these transport-thermodynamic properties considering diverse ribbon widths, defining metallic and semiconducting regimes. We find both quantities $S$ and $s$, are highly interconnected within the ribbon's band gap energy region, and their ratio $s/S$ converges to the elementary charge $e$ across that energy window, fulfilling the Kelvin formula $S=s/e$. On the contrary, $s/S$ is undefined for gapless ribbons in the energy window of the first transmission channel. These results establish the ratio between the DEP and the Seebeck coefficient as a reliable and complementary probe for the determination of the elementary charge, and to identify the cleanness of electronic band gaps as $s/S$ matches with $e$.

Title: Suspended phase transitions: droplets trapped by solid films resist complete melting
Authors: Chenyu Jin, Guoxiang Chen, Beibei Wang, Hans Riegler
Abstract: Melting is conventionally understood as a bulk first-order phase transition, where nucleation of the liquid phase is followed by rapid growth until the solid disappears. However, in thin crystalline films containing local heterogeneities, this process can be dramatically altered by interfacial forces. Here, we report experimental evidence of suspended melting in molecularly thin films of long-chain alkanes containing trapped liquid droplets. As temperature increases, these droplets expand and flatten, yet remain pinned within the surrounding solid layers, preventing full melting. The observed sensitivity of apparent contact angle to small temperature changes is explained by a theoretical model balancing bulk melting enthalpy and interfacial energies. This work highlights how melting in thin films can be frustrated and spatially arrested by local wetting constraints, revealing a rich interplay between phase transition dynamics, confinement, and interfacial topology. Beyond alkanes, these results suggest a generic mechanism by which melting, wetting, and film morphology conspire to locally suspend phase transitions.

Title: Equivariant Electronic Hamiltonian Prediction with Many-Body Message Passing
Authors: Chen Qian, Valdas Vitartas, James Kermode, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: Machine learning surrogates of Kohn-Sham Density Functional Theory Hamiltonians offer a powerful tool to accelerate the prediction of electronic properties of materials, such as electronic band structures and densities-of-states. For large-scale applications, an ideal model would exhibit high generalization ability and computational efficiency. Here, we introduce the MACE-H graph neural network, which combines high body-order message passing with a node-order expansion to efficiently obtain all relevant $O(3)$ irreducible representations. The model achieves high accuracy and computational efficiency and captures the full local chemical environment features of, currently, up to $f$ orbital matrix interaction blocks. We demonstrate the model's accuracy and transferability on several open materials benchmark datasets of two-dimensional materials and a new dataset for bulk gold, achieving sub-meV prediction errors on matrix elements and eigenvalues across all systems. We further analyse the interplay of high body order message passing and locality that makes this model a good candidate for high-throughput material screening.

Title: Microstructural and preliminary optical and microwave characterization of erbium doped CaMoO$_4$ thin films
Authors: Ignas Masiulionis, Bonnie Y.X. Lin, Sagar Kumar Seth, Gregory D. Grant, Wanda L. Lindquist, Sungjoon Kim, Junghwa Kim, Angel Yanguas-Gil, Jeffrey W. Elam, Jiefei Zhang, James M. LeBeau, David D. Awschalom, Supratik Guha
Abstract: This work explores erbium-doped calcium molybdate (CaMoO$_4$) thin films grown on silicon and yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) substrates, as a potential solid state system for C-band (utilizing the $\sim$1.5 $\mu$m Er$^{3+}$ 4f-4f transition) quantum emitters for quantum network applications. Through molecular beam epitaxial growth experiments and electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction and reflection electron diffraction studies, we identify an incorporation limited deposition regime that enables a 1:1 Ca:Mo ratio in the growing film leading to single phase CaMoO$_4$ formation that can be in-situ doped with Er (typically 2-100 ppm). We further show that growth on silicon substrates is single phase but polycrystalline in morphology; while growth on YSZ substrates leads to high-quality epitaxial single crystalline CaMoO$_4$ films. We perform preliminary optical and microwave characterization on the suspected $Y_1 - Z_1$ transition of 2 ppm, 200 nm epitaxial CaMoO$_4$ annealed thin films and extract an optical inhomogeneous linewidth of 9.1(1) GHz, an optical excited state lifetime of 6.7(2) ms, a spectral diffusion-limited homogeneous linewidth of 6.7(4) MHz, and an EPR linewidth of 1.10(2) GHz.

Title: Theoretical Study of Impurity Effects on Superconductivity in UTe2
Authors: Koki Doi, Shingo Haruna, Mutsuki Iwamoto, Takuji Nomura, Hirono Kaneyasu
Abstract: This study investigates the impurity effects on UTe2 within the self-consistent Born approximation using the six-orbital f-d-p model which contains two uranium and tellurium atoms in the minimum unit cell. We analyze the dependence of superconducting transition temperature (Tc) on impurity concentration for various pairing symmetries proposed by experiments and theories. It clarifies that the decrease of Tc significantly depends on which atom sites the impurities reside. Particulalry, the analysis shows that the impurity at U-site has dominant effect on the change of Tc. Then, either the singlet state in the case of magnetic impurities or the triplet states in both non-magnetic and magnetic impurities are consistent with experiments. Thus, this indicates that elucidating the magnetic properties of impurities (i.e. magnetic or non-magnetic) is crucial for identifying the pairing symmetry of UTe2.

Title: Quantum-size effect induced Andreev bound states in ultrathin metallic islands proximitized by a superconductor
Authors: Guanyong Wang, Li-Shuo Liu, Zhen Zhu, Yue Zheng, Bo Yang, Dandan Guan, Shiyong Wang, Yaoyi Li, Canhua Liu, Wei Chen, Hao Zheng, Jinfeng Jia
Abstract: While Andreev bound states (ABSs) have been realized in engineered superconducting junctions, their direct observation in normal metal/superconductor heterostructures-enabled by quantum confinement-remains experimentally elusive. Here, we report the detection of ABSs in ultrathin metallic islands (Bi, Ag, and SnTe) grown on the s-wave superconductor NbN. Using high-resolution scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, we clearly reveal in-gap ABSs with energies symmetric about the Fermi level. While the energies of these states show no position dependence, their wave functions exhibit spatial oscillations, demonstrating a quantum size effect. Both the energy levels and spatial distribution of the ABSs can be reproduced by our effective model in which a metallic island is coupled to the superconducting substrate via the proximity effect. We demonstrate that the coupling strength plays a critical role in determining the ABS energies. Our work introduces a novel physical platform for implementing ABSs, which hold promise for significant device applications.

Title: Unraveling Shear Strain Induced Ferroelectric-to-Antiferroelectric Phase Transition and Accessing Intrinsic Antiferroelectricity in Two-dimensional NbOCl2
Authors: Jiawei Mao, Yinglu Jia, Gaoyang Gou, Shi Liu, Xiao Cheng Zeng
Abstract: Compared to the well studied two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectricity, much rare is the appearance of 2D antiferroelectricity, where local dipoles from the nonequivalent sublattices within 2D monolayers are oppositely orientated. Using NbOCl2 monolayer with competing ferroelectric (FE) and antiferroelectric (AFE) phases as a 2D material platform, we demonstrate the emerging of intrinsic antiferroelectricity in NbOCl2 monolayer under the experimentally accessible shear strain, and new functionality associated with electric field induced AFE-to-FE phase transition. Specifically, the complex configuration space accommodating FE and AFE phases, polarization switching kinetics and finite temperature thermodynamic properties of 2D NbOCl2, are all accurately predicted by large-scale molecular dynamic (MD) simulations based on deep learning interatomic potential (DP) model. Moreover, room temperature stable antiferroelectricity with low polarization switching barrier and one-dimensional (1D) collinear polarization arrangement is predicted in shear deformed NbOCl2 monolayer. Transition from AFE to FE phase in 2D NbOCl2 can be triggered by the low critical electric field, leading to the double polarization-electric (P-E) loop with small hysteresis. A new type optoelectronic device composed of AFE-NbOCl2, enabling electric "writing" and nonlinear optical "reading" logical operation with fast operation speed and low power consumption is also proposed.

Title: Marangoni swimmer pushing particle raft under 1D confinement
Authors: Abhradeep Maitra, Anupam Pandey, Sebastien Michelin, Sunghwan Jung
Abstract: Active matter systems, due to their spontaneous self-propulsion ability, hold potential for future applications in healthcare and environmental sustainability. Marangoni swimmers, a type of synthetic active matter, are a common model system for understanding the underlying physics. Existing studies of the interactions of active matter with passive particles have mostly focused on the modification of the behavior of the passive particles. In contrast, we analyse here experimentally the impact on the self-propulsion of camphor-infused agarose disks (active) of their interactions with floating hollow glass microspheres (passive) within an annular channel. Two distinct regimes are observed: a steady regime with uni-directional motion of the swimmer at low packing fractions (\phi_{\textrm{ini}} \lesssim 0.45) and an oscillatory regime with to-and-fro motion at higher packing fractions (\phi_{\textrm{ini}} \gtrsim 0.45). In the former, the swimmer pushes nearly the entire particle raft together with it, like a towing cargo, causing a decrease in swimmer speed with increasing packing fraction due to the additional drag from the particle raft. A simplified force-balance model is finally proposed that captures the experimental trend in swimmer speed reasonably well.

Title: Obstacle-tuned transition from chaotic to coherent vortex flows and odd diffusion in chiral active fluids
Authors: Joscha Mecke, Yongxiang Gao, Marisol Ripoll
Abstract: The interaction of a suspension of rotating colloids with a periodically patterned structure is here investigated by means of continuum theoretical predictions and hydrodynamic simulations. Close to the obstacle surface, rotors circulate opposite to their inherent direction of rotation as a result of unidirectional rotational stresses, which is in agreement with a prediction of the generalised Stokes equation. The resulting stationary background flow significantly affects the system dynamics and coexists with the intrinsic active turbulent behaviour. The relative importance of either of the two contributions can be controlled with the rotor density and the obstacle size, such that the system is either dominated by stationary vortices pinned to the obstacles or vivid active turbulent dynamics. While momentum dissipation into an underlying frictional substrate damps the related flows, small values of the friction can enhance the vortex flow around an obstacle. The colloids' diffusive dynamics are governed by odd diffusive fluxes guiding the colloids around the excluded volume introduced by obstacles, such that enhanced effective diffusive transport is obtained at finite obstruction. Our results pave the way to systematically address how confinement can be employed in order to control or harness the dynamics of colloidal chiral active turbulence and how the interplay of emerging edge currents and active turbulent dynamics at varying densities can be systematically determined.

Title: Microphases in Active Brownian Particle Systems Lead to Collective Motion
Authors: Cheng Yang, Qiandong Dai, Shun Xu, Xin Zhou
Abstract: Active matter can consume energy to generate active forces that propel themselves and to exhibit numerous fascinating out-of-equilibrium features. The paradigmatic model, active Brownian particles, even without attractive and alignment interactions, can form a phase coexistence of low- and high-density phases. Recent researches have revealed that particles within the high-density phase move in a coordinated manner, creating either aligned or vortex-like velocity-correlation domains. However, the mechanism underlying the translation or rotation of these domains remains unclear. In this study, we demonstrate that the velocity-correlation domains are spatially consistent with the ordered microphases. The microphases, surrounded by defects, are hexatic and differently oriented microdomains. The direction of particles' active forces at the edge of a microphase tends to point inward, creating compression that maintains this microphase. The net active force or active torque acting on the microphase causes it to translate or rotate, thereby generating the velocity-correlation domains.

Title: Multiple crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle
Authors: Ishita Tikader, Muktish Acharyya
Abstract: The transient behaviours of a Blume-Capel ferromagnetic needle have been studied extensively by Monte-Carlo simulation. The needle has an elongated length in one direction compared to its cross-section. In the context of transient behaviour, we have captured the decay of the metastable state and the magnetic relaxation behaviours in our study. The dependence of metastable behaviour with anisotropy (single site) has been studied. \emph{Interestingly, we have observed multiple (different values of $n$ in different time domains) crossover in the decay of metastable volume fraction (obeying Avrami's law $\beta \sim {\rm exp}(-Kt^n)$). We have identified the crossover time, and the values of $n$ are estimated precisely.} The mean (magnetic) reversal time has been studied as a function of anisotropy. It is observed to be almost independent of anisotropy for its negative value; however, it is found to decrease exponentially with positive anisotropy. The exponential relaxation behaviour (in the corresponding paramagnetic phase) is observed. The range of the relaxation time is observed to decrease as the temperature increases.

Title: A rutile-based homologous series Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$ discovered by computationally assisted high-pressure synthesis
Authors: Yasuhito Kobayashi, Hidefumi Takahashi, Shunsuke Kitou, Akitoshi Nakano, Hajime Sagayama, Yuichi Yamasaki, Shintaro Ishiwata
Abstract: Layered transition metal oxides typified by the Ruddlesden-Popper phase have been extensively studied for its applications in high-temperature superconductivity, catalysis, and battery technologies. Despite the remarkable structural diversity and catalytic functionality of platinum oxides, the exploration of layered polymorphs has remained significantly constrained mainly due to the high inertness of platinum. Here, we discover a new homologous series of layered ternary oxides, Na(PtO$_2$)$_{2\it{n}+1}$, by a combination of highly oxidizing high-pressure methods and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. This series features unprecedented layered structural motifs, rutile-based PtO$_6$ octahedra and one-dimensional PtO$_4$ square-planar columns, which enables systematic control of dimensionality. Furthermore, we demonstrate a computationally-assisted identification of isomeric and putative members of this homologous series as confirmed by controlled synthesis and quantitative analysis of diffuse scattering data. This approach provides an effective platform for the exhaustive exploration of metastable transition metal oxides with rich structural variations.

Title: Radio-Frequency Quantum Rectification in Kagome Superconductor CsV3Sb5
Authors: Han-Xin Lou, Jing-Jing Chen, Xing-Guo Ye, Zhen-Bing Tan, An-Qi Wang, Qing Yin, Xin Liao, Jing-Zhi Fang, Xing-Yu Liu, Yi-Lin He, Zhen-Tao Zhang, Chuan Li, Zhong-Ming Wei, Xiu-Mei Ma, Dapeng Yu, Zhi-Min Liao
Abstract: Rectification of electromagnetic fields into direct current (DC) is pivotal for energy harvesting, wireless charging, and next-generation communication technologies. The superconducting diode effect, which exploits the nonreciprocal transport of dissipationless superconducting currents, offers ultra-low power consumption and high rectification ratios. Combining the superconducting diode effect with the AC Josephson effect holds promise for converting radio-frequency (rf) irradiation into a quantized DC output. However, experimental realization has been hindered by challenges in achieving the necessary symmetry breaking and fabricating high-performance Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate the quantum rectification in kagome superconductor CsV3Sb5, which hosts emergent Josephson effects and a zero-field Josephson diode. Under rf irradiation, a DC voltage emerges without applied bias, scaling linearly with frequency as V = hf/2e, where h is Planck's constant, f is the microwave frequency, and e is the electron charge. Furthermore, the rectified voltage exhibits quantized steps with increasing rf power, consistent with Shapiro step quantization. Our work establishes CsV3Sb5 as a versatile platform for wireless quantum power supplies and charging, and underscores the intertwined order parameters as a promising pathway for precise quantum matter control.

Title: Electron-Hole Crossover in $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-δ}$ Thin Films
Authors: Maosen Wang, Bo Hao, Wenjie Sun, Shengjun Yan, Shengwang Sun, Hongyi Zhang, Zhengbin Gu, Yuefeng Nie
Abstract: The ambient-pressure superconductivity in $\mathrm{La}_{3}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7}$ thin films via compressive epitaxial strain provides a highly accessible platform for diverse characterization techniques, facilitating the studies of high-temperature superconductivity. Here, we systematically map the superconducting dome in compressively strained $\mathrm{La}_{3-x}\mathrm{Sr}_{x}\mathrm{Ni}_{2}\mathrm{O}_{7-\delta}$ thin films by simultaneously tuning Sr doping and oxygen content and reveal an electron-hole crossover associated with the maximum transition temperature (${T}_{c}$). This electron-hole crossover, marked by an anomalous sign change in the Hall coefficient (${R}_{H}$), is reminiscent of electron-doped cuprates, which may signal a Fermi surface reconstruction. Beyond the superconducting dome, a $\ln1/T$ insulating regime and a $T$-linear resistivity regime are also resolved, resembling behaviors observed in cuprates and infinite-layer nickelates. This work reveals a dome-shaped relationship between ${T}_{c}$ and ${R}_{H}$ and establishes a key framework for understanding unconventional superconductivity in nickelate systems.

Title: Flow Matching at Scale: A Machine Learning Framework for Efficient Large-Size Sampling of Many-Body Systems
Authors: Qian-Rui Lee, Daw-Wei Wang
Abstract: We propose a machine learning framework based on Flow Matching to overcome the scaling limitations of Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We demonstrate its capability in the 2D XY model, where a single network, trained only on configurations from a small ($32\times 32$) lattice at sparse temperature points, generates reliable samples for a significantly larger system ($128\times 128$) across a continuous temperature range without retraining. The generated configurations show strong agreement with key thermodynamic observables and correctly capture the signatures of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition. This dual generalization is enabled by the Flow Matching framework, which allows us to learn a continuous, temperature-conditioned mapping. At the same time, the inductive biases of the underlying CNN architecture ensure that the learned local physical rules are scale-invariant. This "train-small, generate-large" capability establishes a new paradigm for efficiently studying critical phenomena, offering a significant computational advantage for exploring the thermodynamic limit. The method can be directly applied to other classical or quantum many-body systems described by continuous fields on a lattice.

Title: Topological potentials guiding protein self-assembly
Authors: Ivan Spirandelli, Dmitriy Morozov, Arnur Nigmetov, Myfanwy E. Evans
Abstract: The simulated self-assembly of molecular building blocks into functional complexes is a key area of study in computational biology and materials science. Self-assembly simulations of proteins, driven by short-range non-polar interactions, can find the biologically correct assembly as the energy minimizing state. Short-ranged potentials produce rugged energy landscapes however, which lead to simulations becoming trapped in non-functional, local minimizers. Successful self-assembly simulations depend both on the physical realism of the driving potentials as well as their ability to efficiently explore the configuration space. We introduce a long-range topological potential, quantified via weighted total persistence, and combine it with the morphometric approach to solvation-free energy. This combination improves the assembly success rate in simulations of the tobacco mosaic virus dimer and other protein complexes by up to sixteen-fold compared with the morphometric model alone. It further enables successful simulation in systems that don't otherwise assemble during the examined timescales. Compared to previous topology-based work, which has been primarily descriptive, our approach uses topological measures as an active energetic bias that is independent of electrostatics or chemical specificity and depends only on atomic coordinates. Therefore the method can, in principle, be applied to arbitrary systems where such coordinates are optimized. Integrating topological descriptions into an energy function offers a general strategy for overcoming kinetic barriers in molecular simulations, with potential applications in drug design, materials development, and the study of complex self-assembly processes.

Title: The effect of multi-occupancy traps on the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes in irradiated tungsten and vanadium
Authors: Sanjeet Kaur, Daniel R. Mason, Prashanth Srinivasan, Stephen Dixon, Sid Mungale, Teresa Orr, Mikhail Yu. Lavrentiev, Duc Nguyen-Manh
Abstract: We propose a computational scheme for the diffusion and retention of multiple hydrogen isotopes (HI) with multi-occupancy traps parameterized by first principles calculations. We show that it is often acceptable to reduce the complexity of the coupled differential equations for gas evolution by taking the dynamic steady state, a generalisation of the Oriani equilibrium for multiple isotopes and multi-occupancy traps. The effective gas diffusivity varies most with mobile fraction when the total gas concentration approximates the trap density. We show HI binding to a monovacancy in vanadium produces a non-monotonic dependence between diffusivity and gas concentration, unlike the tungsten system. We demonstrate the difference between multiple single occupancy traps and multi-occupancy traps in long-term diffusion dynamics. The applicability of the multi-occupancy, multi-isotope model in steady state is assessed by comparison to an isotope exchange experiment between hydrogen and deuterium in self-ion irradiated tungsten. The vacancy distribution is estimated with molecular dynamics, and the retention across sample depth shows good agreement with experiment using no fitting parameters.

Title: Role of Ward-Takahashi identity in an electron-phonon coupled system -- Revisiting phonon shift current
Authors: Takahiro Morimoto, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: We study bulk photovoltaic effects in electron-phonon coupled systems. The conservation of current or gauge invariance, manifested as the Ward-Takahashi identity, plays an essential role in the analysis of the Feynman diagrams, and the leading order contribution to the phonon shift current is identified accordingly. The leading order contribution essentially arises from the electric polarization carried by optically excited phonons, where the shift current is generated due to a change of electric polarization in the steady state under the optical excitation of phonons.

Title: Analytical Theory of Chiral Active Particle Transport in a Fluctuating Density Field
Authors: Jayam Joshi, Shradha Mishra
Abstract: We develop a closed-form analytical theory for the transport of a chiral active Brownian particle (cABP) in three dimensions, moving through a fluctuating local density field that coarse-grains steric and dynamical interactions in a dense active medium. The density field is modeled as an Ornstein--Uhlenbeck process with finite correlation time $\tau$ and fluctuation strength $\sigma_\rho^2$, capturing both spatial variations and temporal memory. Within this framework, we derive exact expressions for the mean-squared displacement (MSD) and time-dependent diffusivity, showing how chirality and density coupling renormalize orientational persistence and generate dynamical crossovers. The theory predicts: (i) anomalously high initial diffusivity in denser regions, arising from a transient drift driven by local swim-pressure gradients; (ii) a finite crossover time $t_c$ for homogenizing density inhomogeneities, with steady-state diffusivity retaining memory of the initial environment; (iii) a non-monotonic $t_c(\Omega)$ with a global minimum at intermediate chirality, and a three-regime suppression of $D_\infty(\Omega)$ consistent with clustered phases in simulations; and (iv) a resonance-like peak in early-time oscillatory transport at an optimal chirality $\Omega^*$. The framework reproduces known scaling of $D_\infty$ with activity and chirality, while uncovering new memory effects and chirality-controlled optimal transport, offering predictive insight for biological circle swimmers and active metamaterials.

Title: Constrained Random Phase Approximation: the spectral method

Abstract: We present a new constrained Random Phase Approximation (cRPA) method, termed spectral cRPA (s-cRPA), and compare it to established cRPA approaches for Scandium and Copper by varying the 3d shell filling. The s-cRPA consistently yields larger Hubbard $U$ interaction values. Applied to the realistic system CaFeO$_3$, s-cRPA produces interaction parameters significantly closer to those required within DFT+$U$ to induce the experimentally observed insulating state, overcoming the metallic behavior predicted by standard density functionals. We also address the issue of negative interaction values found in the projector cRPA method for filled d-shells, demonstrating that s-cRPA offers superior numerical stability through electron conversion. Overall, s-cRPA is more robust and effectively overcomes the known underestimation of $U$ in standard cRPA, making it a promising tool for the community. Additionally, we have enhanced our implementation with features for computing multi-center interactions to analyze spatial decay and developed a low-scaling variant with a compressed Matsubara grid to efficiently obtain full frequency-dependent interactions.

Title: Strong lead-free bioinspired piezoceramics for durable energy transducers
Authors: Ruxue Yang, Temesgen Tadeyos Zate, Soumyajit Mojumder, Oriol Gavalda-Diaz, Zihe Li, Ajeet Kumar, James Roscow, Hamideh Khanbareh, Astri Bjørnetun Haugen, Florian Bouville
Abstract: Durable, high-performance and eco-friendly lead-free piezoceramics are essential for next-generation sustainable energy transducers and electromechanical systems. While significant performance enhancements have been made, through chemical composition, texture, or crystal defects, piezoceramics are intrinsically weak mechanically, which negatively impact their working conditions and durability. What's more, improving comprehensive mechanical durability without sacrificing piezoelectric performance remains a key challenge. Here, we design bioinspired Bi0.5Na0.5TiO3 (BNT) ceramics using a scalable colloidal process that enables multiscale control over the microstructure. The design comprises plate-like monocrystalline BNT bricks stacked to induce a crystallographic texture along the poling direction, bonded together by a silica-based mortar, forming the brick-and-mortar phase. This deliberate microstructure design yields 2- to 3-fold increase in flexural strength, and 1.6- to 2-fold increase in fracture toughness compared with a BNT synthesized conventionally, comparable to common structural ceramics, without sacrificing the piezoelectric performance. In addition, the bioinspired BNT exhibit dramatically enhanced ferroelectric fatigue resistance, with a 40- to 600-folds improvement in the number of field-induced electromechanical cycles before failure. These gains stem from residual stress fields generated at the interface between silica pockets and BNT bricks, which delay crack initiation. Furthermore, we demonstrated enhanced transducing capability and electromechanical fatigue resistance using a cantilever beam-based piezoelectric transducer under bending mode. Given its non-chemical-compositional origin, this bioinspired strategy could be broadly applicable to other piezoelectric material systems for applications where both functional and structural performance are critical.

Title: Bending nanoribbon to induce large anisotropic magnetoconductance
Authors: Ponder Liu, Hao-Cheng Hung, You-Ting Huang, Jia-Cheng Li, Carmine Ortix, Ching-Hao Chang
Abstract: When a nanoribbon is bent under a homogeneous external magnetic field, the effective magnetic field inside becomes either homogeneous or inhomogeneous, depending on the direction of the field. This enables the selective creation of bulk, interface, and edge magnetic states in the bent structure, for a magnetic field with a strength. We establish theoretically that these tuneable states lead to a strong geometry-induced anisotropic magnetoconductance (GAMC) in perpendicularly bent nanoribbon, which can reach up to 100\%. Moreover, the GAMC can be further enhanced to 200\%, 300\%, or even higher by either further bending or tuning the bending angle. The potential of this phenomenon for practical applications is demonstrated by its stable anisotropy, which remains consistent across a wide range of Fermi energies, can be observed even at weak magnetic fields and room temperature, and occurs in various systems such as two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) and graphene.

Title: Spontaneous nonreciprocal transport in a gate-tunable ferromagnetic Rashba 2-dimensional electron gas
Authors: Gabriel Lazrak, Radu Abrudan, Borge Göbel, David Hrabovsky, Chen Luo, Victor Ukleev, Srijani Mallik, Luis M. Vicente-Arche, Florin Radu, Sergio Valencia, Annika Johansson, Agnès Barthélémy, Manuel Bibes
Abstract: The broken inversion symmetry at interfaces of complex oxides gives rise to emergent phenomena, including ferromagnetism and Rashba spin-orbit coupling (SOC), which profoundly influence the electronic structure by entangling spin and momentum. While the interplay between Rashba SOC and ferromagnetism is theoretically intriguing, its experimental manifestations remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrate that ferromagnetic 2DEGs at SrTiO$_3$-based interfaces exhibit spontaneous nonreciprocal transport - a distinctive hallmark of Rashba ferromagnets - even in the absence of an external magnetic field. This nonreciprocal response, along with clear signatures of ferromagnetism such as anisotropic magnetoresistance and the anomalous Hall effect (AHE), is strongly tunable by gate voltage. Remarkably, the AHE not only varies in amplitude but even reverses sign, reflecting a subtle interplay between Fermi level position and Berry curvature distribution. These results establish SrTiO$_3$ 2DEGs as a model platform for studying Rashba ferromagnetism and demonstrate active control over transport phenomena in time- and inversion-symmetry-broken systems, paving the way for gate-tunable spintronic devices.

Title: Casimir versus Helmholtz fluctuation induced force in { the Nagle}-Kardar model: Exact results
Authors: Daniel Dantchev, Nicholay S. Tonchev, Joseph Rudnick
Abstract: When used to describe \textit{finite} systems the {conjugate} statistical-mechanical ensembles are \textit{not} equivalent. This has physical implications for the behavior of the fluctuation induced forces pertinent to the different ensembles. Here, {we study the Nagle-Kardar model within the grand-canonical ensemble (GCE) and the canonical ensemble (CE) (with conserved total magnetization) for periodic boundary conditions (PBC)}. {We focus on two fluctuation-induce forces: the Casimir force (CF) in the GCE and the Helmholtz force (HF) in the CE}. In the infinite system limit the model exhibits a critical line, which ends at a tricritical point. Unexpectedly, the critical Casimir force (CCF) is \textit{repulsive} near the critical line and tricritical point, decaying rapidly upon departure from those two regions and becoming \textit{attractive}. This violates the widely-accepted ``boundary condition rule,'' which presumes that the CCF is attractive for equivalent boundary conditions (BC) and repulsive for conflicting BC. For the HF we find that it also changes sign as a function of temperature and the magnetization. We conclude, that CCF and HF have a behavior quite different from each other as a function of the tunable parameters (temperature, magnetic field, or magnetization) of the model. This dependence allows {for the control of the} \textit{sign} of these forces, as well as their magnitude.

Title: Quantum Geometric Renormalization of the Hall Coefficient and Unconventional Hall Resistivity in ZrTe5
Authors: Huimin Xie, Bo Fu, Huan-Wen Wang, Wenyu Shan, Shun-Qing Shen
Abstract: The anomalous Hall effect (AHE), conventionally associated with time-reversal symmetry breaking in ferromagnetic materials, has recently been observed in nonmagnetic topological materials, raising questions about its origin. We unravel the unconventional Hall response in the nonmagnetic Dirac material ZrTe5, known for its massive Dirac bands and unique electronic and transport properties. Using the Kubo-Streda formula within the Landau level framework, we explore the interplay of quantum effects induced by the magnetic field (B) and disorder across the semiclassical and quantum regimes. In the semiclassical regime, the Hall resistivity remains linear in the magnetic field, but the Hall coefficient will be renormalized by the quantum geometric effects and electron-hole coherence, especially at low carrier densities where the disorder scattering dominates. In quantum limit, the Hall conductivity exhibits an unsaturating 1/B scaling. As a result, the transverse conductivity dominates transport in the ultra-quantum limit, and the Hall resistivity crosses over from B to B^{-1} dependence as the system transitions from the semiclassical regime to the quantum limit. This work elucidates the mechanisms underlying the unconventional Hall effect in ZrTe5 and provides insights into the AHE in other nonmagnetic Dirac materials as well.

Title: Rotating Spin Wave Modes in Nanoscale Möbius Strips
Authors: Ashfaque Thonikkadavan, Massimiliano d'Aquino, Riccardo Hertel
Abstract: Curved and topologically nontrivial magnetic structures offer new pathways to control spin-wave behavior beyond planar geometries. Here, we study spin-wave dynamics in Möbius-shaped soft-magnetic nanostrips using micromagnetic simulations. By comparing single-, double-, and triple-twisted Möbius strips to a topologically trivial bent ring, we isolate the roles of helical twist and non-orientable topology. Möbius geometries exhibit non-degenerate mode doublets associated with counterpropagating spin waves, in contrast to the standing-wave doublets in the trivial case. This splitting arises from a twist-induced geometric (Berry) phase that breaks propagation symmetry, producing non-reciprocal dispersion relations. The Möbius topology further imposes antisymmetric boundary conditions, resulting in half-integer wavelength quantization. Local RF excitation allows for the selective generation of spin waves with defined frequency and direction. An analytical model reproduces the dispersion behavior with excellent agreement. These results highlight how geometric and topological design can be leveraged to engineer spin-wave transport in three-dimensional magnonic systems.

Title: Competition Between Controllable Non-Radiative and Intrinsic Radiative Second-Order Recombination in Halide Perovskites
Authors: Dengyang Guo, Alan R. Bowman, Sebastian Gorgon, Changsoon Cho, Youngkwang Jung, Jiashang Zhao, Linjie Dai, Jaewang Park, Kyung Mun Yeom, Satyawan Nagane, Stuart Macpherson, Weidong Xu, Jun Hong Noh, Sang Il Seok, Tom Savenije, Samuel D. Stranks
Abstract: Halide perovskite solar cells have demonstrated a rapid increase in power conversion efficiencies. Understanding and mitigating remaining carrier losses in halide perovskites is now crucial to enable further increases to approach their practical efficiency limits. Whilst the most widely known non-radiative recombination from solar cells relates to carrier trapping and is first order in carrier density, recent reports have revealed a non-radiative pathway that is second order. However, the origin and impact of this second-order process on devices remain unclear. Here, we understand this non-radiative second-order recombination (k2non) pathway by manipulating the charge carrier dynamics via controlling the bulk and surface conditions. By combining temperature-dependent spectroscopies, we demonstrate that the value of k2non depends on extrinsic factors, in contrast to intrinsic second-order recombination, which aligns with theoretical evaluations through van Roosbroeck-Shockley relations. Based on density functional theory simulations and Quasi-Fermi level calculations, we propose that shallow surface states are the primary origin of this second-order non-radiative component, contributing up to ~80 mV of the overall reduction in Voc at room temperature. This work reveals that carrier losses from two non-radiative recombination types (first and second order) are not linked, emphasizing the need for distinctive mitigation strategies targeting each type to unlock the full efficiency potential of perovskite solar cells.

Title: Polymer translocation through extended patterned pores: scaling of the total translocation time
Authors: Andri Sharma, Abhishek Chaudhuri, Rajeev Kapri
Abstract: We study the translocation of a flexible polymer through extended patterned pores using molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. We consider cylindrical and conical pore geometries that can be controlled by the angle of the pore apex $\alpha$. We obtained the average translocation time $\langle \tau \rangle$ for various chain lengths $N$ and the length of the pores $L_p$ for various values $\alpha$ and found that $\langle \tau \rangle$ scales as $\langle \tau \rangle \sim N^\gamma \mathcal{F}\left( L_p N^\phi \right)$ with exponents $\gamma = 3.00\pm0.05$ and $\phi = 1.50\pm0.05$ for both patterned and unpatterned pores.

Title: Surface separation in elastoplastic contacts
Authors: Andreas Almqvist, Bo N. J. Persson
Abstract: Understanding the contact between rough surfaces undergoing plastic deformation is crucial in many applications. We study the effect of plastic deformation on the surface separation between two solids with random roughness. Assuming a constant penetration hardness, we propose a procedure within Persson's multiscale contact mechanics theory to obtain the average surface separation by applying the elastic formulation to an effective power spectrum that accounts for plastic smoothing. Deterministic numerical simulations based on the boundary element method are used to validate the procedure and show good agreement with the theoretical predictions. The treatment also provides a route to incorporate plastic stiffening of the roughness as the stress state becomes increasingly hydrostatic at large plastic deformation.

Title: Attention-Based Explainability for Structure-Property Relationships
Authors: Boris N. Slautin, Utkarsh Pratiush, Yongtao Liu, Hiroshi Funakubo, Vladimir V. Shvartsman, Doru C. Lupascu, Sergei V. Kalinin
Abstract: Machine learning methods are emerging as a universal paradigm for constructing correlative structure-property relationships in materials science based on multimodal characterization. However, this necessitates development of methods for physical interpretability of the resulting correlative models. Here, we demonstrate the potential of attention-based neural networks for revealing structure-property relationships and the underlying physical mechanisms, using the ferroelectric properties of PbTiO3 thin films as a case study. Through the analysis of attention scores, we disentangle the influence of distinct domain patterns on the polarization switching process. The attention-based Transformer model is explored both as a direct interpretability tool and as a surrogate for explaining representations learned via unsupervised machine learning, enabling the identification of physically grounded correlations. We compare attention-derived interpretability scores with classical SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) analysis and show that, in contrast to applications in natural language processing, attention mechanisms in materials science exhibit high efficiency in highlighting meaningful structural features.

Title: On-the-fly electrical readout of individual skyrmion dynamics by anomalous Hall effect, correlated with real-time Kerr microscopy
Authors: Grischa Beneke, Kilian Leutner, Nikhil Vijayan, Fabian Kammerbauer, Duc Minh Tran, Sachin Krishnia, Johannes Güttinger, Armin Satz, Robert Frömter, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions, topologically stabilized spin textures, are promising candidates for future memory devices and non-conventional computing applications due to their enhanced stability, non-linear interactions, and low-power manipulation capabilities. Despite their significant potential, the reliable electrical readout of individual skyrmions remains a fundamental challenge. While magnetic tunnel junctions and anomalous-Hall-effect-based techniques have demonstrated skyrmion detection capabilities, they currently fail to reliably detect single moving skyrmions as required for applications. Our approach leverages thermally activated skyrmions, where a low constant drive current simultaneously generates both skyrmion motion and the Hall voltage necessary for detection. We demonstrate the reliability of this method through real-time correlation between measured Hall voltage signals and direct Kerr microscopy imaging. Two consecutive Hall crosses allow for determining the skyrmion velocity, in accordance to Kerr microscopy videos. These advances establish a robust platform for skyrmion-based sensors, counters and unconventional computing systems that depend on precise individual skyrmion control and detection.

Title: Revisiting thermal transport in CuCl: First-principles calculations and machine learning force fields
Authors: Ashis Kundu, Florian Knoop, Igor A. Abrikosov
Abstract: Accurate prediction of lattice thermal conductivity ($\kappa_l$) in strongly anharmonic materials requires renormalized interatomic force constants (IFCs) and appropriate incorporation of diagonal and off-diagonal contributions and higher-order scattering. We investigate CuCl, a highly anharmonic system with a simple zincblende structure and ultralow $\kappa_l$. Our calculations, including IFC renormalization and four-phonon scattering, show excellent agreement with the experiment, underscoring the critical role of both effects in the accurate estimation of $\kappa_l$. Furthermore, the unusual pressure dependence of $\kappa_l$ is explored using a rigorously validated machine-learned force field, with the predicted values showing good agreement with the experimentally observed trend of monotonic decrease. This behavior is primarily driven by a significant increase in four-phonon scattering and a reduction in the group velocity of transverse acoustic modes. Overall, this study establishes a robust framework for modeling thermal transport in strongly anharmonic materials.

Title: NMR evidence for an antisite-induced magnetic moment on Bi in a topological insulator heterostructures MnBi2Te4/(Bi2Te3)n
Authors: R. Kalvig, E. Jedryka, A. Lynnyk, P. Skupinski, K. Grasza, M. Wojcik
Abstract: MnBi2Te4 (MBT) is the first intrinsic magnetic topological insulator, combining a topologically protected surface metallic state and intrinsic magnetic order. A structural compatibility with the nonmagnetic Bi2Te4 (BT) parent compound gives a possibility to create MBT/BT heterostructures and manipulate their magnetic state in view of optimizing the Quantum Anomalous Hall Effect (QAHE). In this work an extensive NMR study, supported by the bulk magnetization measurements has been performed at 4.2 K on a self-organized single crystal MnBi2Te4(Bi2Te4)n heterostructure. 55Mn and 209Bi NMR signal have been recorded as a function of the out-of-plane magnetic field up to 6T, covering a spin-flop transition from the antiferromagnetic (AFM) to the canted antiferromagnetic (CAFM) configuration of the Mn layers. Structural defects were shown to contribute a small ferromagnetic component below the spin-flop field. Presence of the AFM-coupled Mn antisites has been evidenced and shown to induce an antiparallel magnetic moment on Bi atoms within the host Bi layer. Detection of the induced magnetic moment on bismuth which contributes a new ferromagnetic component is of utmost importance for understanding the magnetic interactions in the MBT/BT system. These findings have potentially important implications for engineering the QAH devices.

Title: Accurate complex-stacking-fault Gibbs energy in Ni3Al at high temperatures
Authors: Xiang Xu, Xi Zhang, Andrei Ruban, Siegfried Schmauder, Blazej Grabowski
Abstract: To gain a deeper insight into the anomalous yield behavior of Ni3Al, it is essential to obtain temperature-dependent formation Gibbs energies of the relevant planar defects. Here, the Gibbs energy of the complex stacking fault (CSF) is evaluated using a recently proposed ab initio framework [Acta Materialia, 255 (2023) 118986], accounting for all thermal contributions - including anharmonicity and paramagnetism - up to the melting point. The CSF energy shows a moderate decrease from 300K to about 1200 K, followed by a stronger drop. We demonstrate the necessity to carefully consider the individual thermal excitations. We also propose a way to analyze the origin of the significant anharmonic contribution to the CSF energy through atomic pair distributions at the CSF plane. With the newly available high-temperature CSF data, an increasing energy barrier for the cross-slip process in Ni3Al with increasing temperature is unveiled, necessitating the refinement of existing analytical models.

Title: Influence of Thermostats on the Dynamics of the Helix-Coil Transition
Authors: Maximilian Conradi, Henrik Christiansen, Suman Majumder, Fabio Müller, Wolfhard Janke
Abstract: We present results from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations for the nonequilibrium dynamics of the collapse and helix-coil transition in polyalanine. In particular, we compare the influence of three different thermostats, viz., the Langevin, Andersen, and Nosé-Hoover thermostats. For that purpose, we investigate the nonequilibrium pathways of the transition from the high-temperature random-coil state to the low-temperature helical state. Additionally, we analyze the time evolution of the potential energy and temperature. Our results show only small differences in the observed phenomenology, albeit quantitatively the dynamics appear to be different for the three thermostats.

Title: Nonequilibrium Dynamics of the Helix-Coil Transition in Polyalanine
Authors: Maximilian Conradi, Henrik Christiansen, Suman Majumder, Fabio Müller, Wolfhard Janke
Abstract: In this work, the nonequilibrium pathways of the collapse of the helix-forming biopolymer polyalanine are investigated. To this end, the full time evolution of the helix-coil transition is simulated using molecular dynamics simulations. At the start of the transition short $3_{10}$-helices form, seemingly leading to the molecule becoming more aspherical midway through the collapse. After the completed collapse, the formation of $\alpha$-helices seems to become the prevalent ordering mechanism leading to helical bundles, a structure representative for the equilibrium behavior of longer chains. The dynamics of this transition is explored in terms of the power-law scaling of two associated relaxation times as a function of the chain length.

Title: Taxonomy of defects in semi-dry transferred CVD graphene
Authors: N. Reckinger, B. Hackens
Abstract: Post-transfer in-depth morphological characterization of graphene grown by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) is of great importance to evaluate the quality and to understand the origin of defects of the transferred sheets. Herein, a semi-dry transfer technique is used to peel off millimeter-sized CVD graphene flakes from polycrystalline copper foils and transfer them onto SiO2/Si substrates. We take advantage of the unique feature of this semi-dry process: it preserves the copper substrate, enabling location-specific morphological comparisons between graphene and copper at various stages of the transfer. Thanks to a combination of morphological characterization techniques, this leads to trace and elucidate the origin of various post-transfer graphene defects (cracks, wrinkles, holes, tears). Specifically, thermally induced wrinkles are shown to evolve into nanoscale cracks, while copper surface steps lead to folds. Furthermore, we find that the macroscale topography of the copper foil also plays a critical role in defect formation. This work provides guidelines on how to correctly interpret the post-transfer morphology of graphene films on relevant substrates and how to properly assess their quality. This contributes to the optimization of both the graphene CVD growth and transfer processes for future applications.

Title: Multifractality in high-dimensional graphs induced by correlated radial disorder
Authors: David E. Logan, Sthitadhi Roy
Abstract: We introduce a class of models containing robust and analytically demonstrable multifractality induced by disorder correlations. Specifically, we investigate the statistics of eigenstates of disordered tight-binding models on two classes of rooted, high-dimensional graphs -- trees and hypercubes -- with a form of strong disorder correlations we term `radial disorder'. In this model, site energies on all sites equidistant from a chosen root are identical, while those at different distances are independent random variables (or their analogue for a deterministic but incommensurate potential, a case of which is also considered). Analytical arguments, supplemented by numerical results, are used to establish that this setting hosts robust and unusual multifractal states. The distribution of multifractality, as encoded in the inverse participation ratios (IPRs), is shown to be exceptionally broad. This leads to a qualitative difference in scaling with system size between the mean and typical IPRs, with the latter the appropriate quantity to characterise the multifractality. The existence of this multifractality is shown to be underpinned by an emergent fragmentation of the graphs into effective one-dimensional chains, which themselves exhibit conventional Anderson localisation. The interplay between the exponential localisation of states on these chains, and the exponential growth of the number of sites with distance from the root, is the origin of the observed multifractality.

Title: Lattice distortions and non-sluggish diffusion in BCC refractory high entropy alloys
Authors: Jingfeng Zhang, Xiang Xu, Fritz Körmann, Wen Yin, Xi Zhang, Christian Gadelmeier, Uwe Glatzel, Blazej Grabowski, Runxia Li, Gang Liu, Biao Wang, Gerhard Wilde, Sergiy V. Divinski
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) have emerged as promising candidates for extreme high-temperature applications, for example, in next-generation turbines and nuclear reactors. In such applications, atomic diffusion critically governs essential properties including creep resistance and microstructural stability. The present study systematically investigates impurity diffusion of Co, Mn, and Zn in single phase (BCC solid solution) HfTiZrNbTa and HfTiZrNbV RHEAs applying the radiotracer technique. A neutron total scattering technique is used to evaluate the pair distribution functions and element-specific lattice distortions in these alloys. \textit{Ab initio}-based calculations give access to lattice distortions and solubilities of the impurities under investigation, including the impact of short-range order. The diffusion results are discussed in relation to calculated substitutional and interstitial solution energies, local lattice distortions, and short-range order effects. Co diffusion is found to be dominated by the interstitial mechanism, exhibiting fast diffusion. These findings reveal important structure-property relationships between local atomic environments and diffusion kinetics in BCC RHEAs, providing critical insights for designing alloys with enhanced high-temperature performance through targeted control of impurity diffusion processes.

Title: Reinforcement learning of a biflagellate model microswimmer
Authors: Sridhar Bulusu, Andreas Zöttl
Abstract: Many microswimmers are able to swim through viscous fluids by employing periodic non-reciprocal deformations of their appendages. Here we use a simple microswimmer model inspired by swimming biflagellates which consists of a spherical cell body and two small spherical beads representing the motion of the two flagella. Using reinforcement learning we identify for different microswimmer morphologies quasi-optimized swimming strokes. For all studied cases the identified strokes result in symmetric and quasi-synchronized beating of the two flagella beads. Interestingly, the stroke-averaged flow fields are of pusher type, and the observed swimming gaits outperform previously used biflagellate microswimmer models relying on predefined circular flagella bead motion.

Title: From Near-Integrable to Far-from-Integrable: A Unified Picture of Thermalization and Heat Transport
Authors: Weicheng Fu, Zhen Wang, Yisen Wang, Yong Zhang, Hong Zhao
Abstract: Whether and how a system approaches equilibrium is central in nonequilibrium statistical physics, crucial to understanding thermalization and transport. Bogoliubov's three-stage (initial, kinetic, and hydrodynamic) evolution hypothesis offers a qualitative framework, but quantitative progress has focused on near-integrable systems like dilute gases. In this work, we investigate the relaxation dynamics of a one-dimensional diatomic hard-point (DHP) gas, presenting a phase diagram that characterizes relaxation behavior across the full parameter space, from near-integrable to far-from-integrable regimes. We analyze thermalization (local energy relaxation in nonequilibrium states) and identify three universal dynamical regimes: (i) In the near-integrable regime, kinetic processes dominate, local energy relaxation decays exponentially, and the thermalization time $\tau$ scales as $\tau \propto \delta^{-2}$. (ii) In the far-from-integrable regime, hydrodynamic effects dominate, energy relaxation decays power-law, and thermalization time scales linearly with system size $N$. (iii) In the intermediate regime, the Bogoliubov phase emerges, characterized by the transition from kinetic to hydrodynamic relaxation. The phase diagram also shows that hydrodynamic behavior can emerge in small systems when sufficiently far from the integrable regime, challenging the view that such effects occur only in large systems. In the thermodynamic limit, the system's relaxation depends on the order in which the limits ($N \to \infty$ or $\delta \to 0$) are taken. We then analyze heat transport (decay of heat-current fluctuations in equilibrium), demonstrating its consistency with thermalization, leading to a unified theoretical description of thermalization and transport. Our approach provides a pathway for studying relaxation dynamics in many-body systems, including quantum systems.

Title: Controlling polymerization-induced phase separation in the synthesis of porous gels
Authors: Yanxia Feng, Noel Ringeisen, Eric R. Dufresne, Lucio Isa, Robert W. Style
Abstract: Porous gels -- gels with solvent-filled pores that are much larger than their mesh size -- are widely used in engineering and biomedical applications due to their tunable mechanics, high water content, and selective permeability. Among various strategies to create porous gels, polymerization-induced phase separation (PIPS) has shown particular promise. However, the conditions that trigger and control PIPS remain poorly understood. Here, we systematically investigate the influence of solvent quality, polymeric precursor molecular weight, and polymer concentration on phase separation in polymerizing poly(ethylene glycol) diacrylate gels. We find that phase separation occurs when the precursor solution concentration is below the overlap concentration. Phase-separated gels have a pore geometry that is controlled by solvent quality: better solvents result in smaller pores, while worse solvents can create superporous, highly-absorbant gels. Motivated by our results, we propose a theory that predicts when phase separation occurs in polymerizing gels, applicable across a wide range of polymer/solvent gel systems. Our results provide a framework for the rational design of porous gels.

Title: Automated Modeling of Polarons: Defects and Reactivity on TiO$_2$(110) Surfaces
Authors: Firat Yalcin, Carla Verdi, Viktor C. Birschitzky, Matthias Meier, Michael Wolloch, Michele Reticcioli
Abstract: Polarons are widespread in functional materials and are key to device performance in several technological applications. However, their effective impact on material behavior remains elusive, as condensed matter studies struggle to capture their intricate interplay with atomic defects in the crystal. In this work, we present an automated workflow for modeling polarons within density functional theory (DFT). Our approach enables a fully automatic identification of the most favorable polaronic configurations in the system. Machine learning techniques accelerate predictions, allowing for an efficient exploration of the defect-polaron configuration space. We apply this methodology to Nb-doped TiO$_2$(110) surfaces, providing new insights into the role of defects in surface reactivity. Using CO adsorbates as a probe, we find that Nb doping has minimal impact on reactivity, whereas oxygen vacancies contribute significantly depending on their local arrangement via the stabilization of polarons on the surface atomic layer. Our package streamlines the modeling of charge trapping and polaron localization with high efficiency, enabling systematic, large-scale investigations of polaronic effects across complex material systems.

Title: Optimizing energy conversion with nonthermal resources in steady-state quantum devices
Authors: Elsa Danielsson, Henning Kirchberg, Janine Splettstoesser
Abstract: We provide a framework for optimizing energy conversion processes in coherent quantum conductors fed by nonthermal resources. Such nonthermal resources, which cannot be characterized by temperatures or electrochemical potentials, occur in small-scale systems that are smaller than their thermalization length. Using scattering theory in combination with a Lagrange multiplier method, we optimize the device's performance based on the efficiency, precision, or a trade-off between the two at a given output current. The transmission properties leading to this optimal performance are identified. We showcase our findings with the example of a refrigerator exploiting experimentally relevant nonthermal resources, which could result from competing environments or from light irradiation. We show that the performance is improved compared to a device exploiting a thermal resource. Our results can serve as guidelines for the design of energy-conversion processes in future nanoelectronic devices.

Authors: Niklas Martin, Laura Álvaro-Gómez, Lucas Perez, André Thiaville, Jean-Paul Adam, Olivier Fruchart, Aurélien Masseboeuf
Abstract: We report an experimental study of spin wave modes in individual cylindrical nanowires, a textbook situation of confined spin waves in 3D nanomagnetism. We observe discrete modes of thermal spin waves with micro-Brillouin light scattering, whose frequencies $f$ shift to higher values as the applied longitudinal induction magnetic field $B_z$ increases. Micromagnetic simulations allowed us to associate every $f(B_z)$ curve to a given spatial mode, labeled with radial and azimuthal indices $\ell$ and $m$.

Title: Predictive models for strain energy in condensed phase reactions
Authors: Baptiste Martin, Shukai Yao, Chunyu Li, Anthony Bocahut, Matthew Jackson, Alejandro Strachan
Abstract: Molecular modeling of thermally activated chemistry in condensed phases is essential to understand polymerization, depolymerization, and other processing steps of molecular materials. Current methods typically combine molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to describe short-time relaxation with a stochastic description of predetermined chemical reactions. Possible reactions are often selected on the basis of geometric criteria, such as a capture distance between reactive atoms. Although these simulations have provided valuable insight, the approximations used to determine possible reactions often lead to significant molecular strain and unrealistic structures. We show that the local molecular environment surrounding the reactive site plays a crucial role in determining the resulting molecular strain energy and, in turn, the associated reaction rates. We develop a graph neural network capable of predicting the strain energy associated with a cyclization reaction from the pre-reaction, local, molecular environment surrounding the reactive site. The model is trained on a large dataset of condensed-phase reactions during the activation of polyacrylonitrile (PAN) obtained from MD simulations and can be used to adjust relative reaction rates in condensed systems and advance our understanding of thermally activated chemical processes in complex materials

Title: Ultrastrong and ductile CoNiMoAl medium-entropy alloys enabled by L12 nanoprecipitate-induced multiple deformation mechanisms
Authors: Min Young Sung, Tae Jin Jang, Sang Yoon Song, Gunjick Lee, KenHee Ryou, Sang-Ho Oh, Byeong-Joo Lee, Pyuck-Pa Choi, Jörg Neugebauer, Blazej Grabowski, Fritz Körmann, Yuji Ikeda, Alireza Zargaran, Seok Su Sohn
Abstract: L12 precipitates are known to significantly enhance the strength and ductility of single-phase face-centered cubic (FCC) medium- or high-entropy alloys (M/HEAs). However, further improvements in mechanical properties remain untapped, as alloy design has historically focused on systems with specific CrCoNi- or FeCoCrNi-based FCC matrix and Ni3Al L12 phase compositions. This study introduces novel Co-Ni-Mo-Al alloys with L12 precipitates by systematically altering Al content, aiming to bridge this research gap by revealing the strengthening mechanisms. The (CoNi)81Mo12Al7 alloy achieves yield strength of 1086 MPa, tensile strength of 1520 MPa, and ductility of 35 %, demonstrating an impressive synergy of strength, ductility, and strain-hardening capacity. Dislocation analysis via transmission electron microscopy, supported by generalized stacking fault energy (GSFE) calculations using density functional theory (DFT), demonstrates that Mo substitution for Al in the L12 phase alters dislocation behavior, promoting the formation of multiple deformation modes, including stacking faults, super-dislocation pairs, Lomer-Cottrell locks, and unusual nano-twin formation even at low strains. These behaviors are facilitated by the low stacking fault energy (SFE) of the FCC matrix, overlapping of SFs, and dislocation dissociation across anti-phase boundaries (APBs). The increased energy barrier for superlattice intrinsic stacking fault (SISF) formation compared to APBs, due to Mo substitution, further influences dislocation activity. This work demonstrates a novel strategy for designing high-performance M/HEAs by expanding the range of FCC matrix and L12 compositions through precipitation hardening.

Title: Electronic structure of the interface between Au and WSe2
Authors: Laxman Nagireddy, Samuel J. Magorrian, Matthew D. Watson, Yogal Prasad Ghimirey, Marc Walker, Cephise Cacho, Neil R. Wilson, Nicholas D. M. Hine
Abstract: Understanding the interface between metals and two-dimensional materials is critical for their application in electronics and for the development of metal-mediated exfoliation of large area monolayers. Studying the intricate interactions at the interface requires model systems that enable control of the roughness, purity, and crystallinity of the metal surface. Here, we investigate the layer-dependent electronic structure of WSe_2 on template-stripped gold substrates fabricated using both silicon and mica templates, giving crystallographically disordered and Au(111) ordered surfaces, respectively, and contrast these findings with ab initio predictions. We observe strong hybridization around the Brillouin zone centre at $\overline{\Gamma}$, indicating a covalent admixture in the gold-\WSe~interaction, and band shifts that suggest charge rearrangement at the Au(111) / WSe_2 interface. Core-level spectroscopy shows a single chemical environment for the interfacial WSe_2 layer on the template-stripped gold, distinct from the subsequent layers. These results reveal a mixture of van der Waals and covalent interactions, best described as a covalent-like quasi-bonding with intermediate interaction strength.

Title: Superpotentials, flat bands and the role of Quantum Geometry for the superfluid stiffness
Authors: T. Bauch, F. Lombardi, G. Seibold
Abstract: We investigate the stability and enhancement of superconductivity in a system subject to a 2D periodic superpotential. This externally imposed modulation leads to a reconstructed multi-band structure with flat bands emerging in certain energy regions. When the chemical potential is tuned into one of these flat bands, the associated increase in the density of states can strongly enhance the superconducting critical temperature Tc compared to the homogeneous case while maintaining the superfluid stiffness Ds at a sizeable value. We also clarify the role of the quantum geometric effect for flat bands in such topologically trivial systems. While the overall paramagnetic interband contribution to the stiffness is negative we identify a class of certain interband scattering processes which enhance Ds and scale with the interaction, playing therefore the same role as quantum geometric effects in conventional flat band models. The enhancement of superconductivity is found to be robust against weak to moderate disorder, suggesting that the system is not overly sensitive to imperfections which is an important prerequisite for experimental realizations. Our results demonstrate that engineered superpotentials offer a compelling alternative to twist-based moire systems, providing a pathway toward tailoring superconductivity via lithographic design.

Title: Octahedral tilting and B-site off-centering in halide perovskites are not coupled
Authors: Colin M. Hylton-Farrington, Richard C. Remsing
Abstract: Metal halide perovskites show exceptional potential for solar energy, thermoelectrics, catalysis, and other photochemical technologies, with performance rooted in electronic structure-driven properties. In ABX3 halide perovskites, localized and often aspherical local electron densities from B-site lone pairs or polarizable X- anions can distort the lattice. However, the links among electronic structure fluctuations and distortions like tilting of the BX6 octahedra and off-centering of the B-site from the center of its octahedron are not fully understood. Using group theory and ab initio molecular dynamics, we quantify how lone pairs, halide polarization, off-centering, and octahedral tilting interact in the cubic phase CsBBr3, with B = Pb, Sn, and Ge. We find that lone pair-induced off-centering and octahedral tilting are symmetry-decoupled. Instead, stereochemical lone pair expression of the B-site ion is correlated to octahedral tilting through the propensity of the B-site to form a transient, partial covalent bond with the surrounding halide ions that stiffens octahedral tilting modes. These results link local electronic asymmetry to structural fluctuations and suggest that dynamic modulation of electronic symmetry offers a pathway to control functional properties in halide perovskites.

Title: Universal Machine Learning Potential for Systems with Reduced Dimensionality
Authors: Giulio Benedini, Antoine Loew, Matti Hellstrom, Silvana Botti, Miguel A. L. Marques
Abstract: We present a benchmark designed to evaluate the predictive capabilities of universal machine learning interatomic potentials across systems of varying dimensionality. Specifically, our benchmark tests zero- (molecules, atomic clusters, etc.), one- (nanowires, nanoribbons, nanotubes, etc.), two- (atomic layers and slabs) and three-dimensional (bulk materials) compounds. The benchmark reveals that while all tested models demonstrate excellent performance for three-dimensional systems, accuracy degrades progressively for lower-dimensional structures. The best performing models for geometry optimization are orbital version 2, equiformerV2, and the equivariant Smooth Energy Network, with the equivariant Smooth Energy Network also providing the most accurate energies. Our results indicate that the best models yield, on average, errors in the atomic positions in the range of 0.01-0.02 angstrom and errors in the energy below 10~meV/atom across all dimensionalities. These results demonstrate that state-of-the-art universal machine learning interatomic potentials have reached sufficient accuracy to serve as direct replacements for density functional theory calculations, at a small fraction of the computational cost, in simulations spanning the full range from isolated atoms to bulk solids. More significantly, the best performing models already enable efficient simulations of complex systems containing subsystems of mixed dimensionality, opening new possibilities for modeling realistic materials and interfaces.

Title: Shear induced topological changes of local structure in dense colloidal suspensions
Authors: Ratimanasee Sahu, Abhishek Kumar Gupta, Peter Schall, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya, Vijayakumar Chikkadi
Abstract: Understanding the structural origins of glass formation and mechanical response remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. Recent studies have identified the local caging potential experienced by a particle due to its nearest neighbors as a robust structural metric that links microscopic structure to dynamics under thermal fluctuations and applied shear. However, its connection to locally favored structural motifs has remained unclear. Here, we analyze structural motifs in colloidal crystals and glasses and correlate them with the local caging potential. We find that icosahedral motifs in glasses are associated with deeper caging potentials than crystalline motifs such as face-centered cubic (FCC) and hexagonal close-packed (HCP) structures. Both crystalline and amorphous systems also contain large number of particles belonging to stable defective motifs, which are distortions of the regular motifs. Under shear, large clusters of defective motifs fragment into smaller ones, driving plastic deformation and the transition from a solid-like to a liquid-like state in amorphous suspensions. Particles that leave clusters of stable motifs are associated with shallower caging potentials and are more prone to plastic rearrangements, ultimately leading to motif disintegration during shear. Our results thus reveal that the loss of mechanical stability in amorphous suspensions is governed by the topological evolution of polytetrahedral motifs, uncovering a structural mechanism underlying plastic deformation and fluidization.

Title: Direct energy dissipation measurements for a driven superfluid via the harmonic-potential theorem
Authors: Clara Tanghe, Senne Van Wellen, Kobe Vergaerde, Karel Van Acoleyen
Abstract: We propose and experimentally demonstrate a method to directly measure energy dissipation for a linearly driven superfluid confined in a harmonic trap. The method relies on a perturbed version of the harmonic-potential theorem, according to which a potential perturbation - effectively acting as a stirrer - converts center-of-mass motional energy into internal energy. Energy conservation then enables a direct, quantitative determination of the dissipated energy from measurements of the macroscopic center-of-mass observables. Applying this method to a perturbed, driven Bose-Einstein condensate, we observe dissipation curves characteristic of superfluid flow, including a critical velocity that depends on the stirrer strength, consistent with previous studies. Our results are supported by mean-field simulations, which corroborate both the theoretical framework and the experimental findings.

Title: High Harmonic Spectroscopy from Lower-Order to Higher-Order Topological Insulators
Authors: Bryan Lorenzo, Camilo Granados, Dasol Kim, Carlos Batista, Jean Menotti, Feng Liu, Wenlong Gao, Alexis Chacon
Abstract: Over the last decade, high-harmonic spectroscopy has been successfully extended to the study of ultrafast electron motion in solids, shedding light on fundamental processes such as Bloch oscillations and higher-order nonlinear phenomena. In this work, we present theoretical studies of high-harmonic spectroscopy applied to topological materials including higher-order ones, focusing on several key observables associated with high-harmonic generation - namely, helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence. We extend current all-optical measurement approaches from lower-order topological insulators (LOTIs) to higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs), employing three distinct models: a Haldane model for Chern insulators, Kane-Mele model for topological insulators, and a breathing Kagome lattice for HOTIs. This work aims to resolve whether helicity, circular dichroism, and ellipticity dependence can reveal signatures of topological states. For the Chern insulators and topological insulators, we find that these observables can indeed capture topological phases. In contrast, for HOTIs, no clear signatures of topology emerge in the harmonic spectrum, suggesting that a more careful analysis is required to identify topological invariants in higher-order topological insulators. In particular, for the topological semimetal phase, we find a harmonic enhancement by two to three orders of magnitude in the Kagome lattice. Our study delineates the conditions under which high-harmonic spectroscopy serves as a unique tool for diagnosing topological phases, particularly for those associated with topological corner states.

Title: Second Harmonic Generation by Multilayer Graphenes and its Dependence on Stacking Order and Encapsulation Environment
Authors: Patrick Johansen Sarsfield, Takaaki V. Joya, Takuto Kawakami, Mikito Koshino, Vladimir Fal'ko
Abstract: In this work, we analyze the effects of external influences on the second harmonic generation (SHG) signal produced by multilayer graphenes. Specifically, we vary the encapsulation conditions and doping of graphenes, seeking to identify SHG "fingerprints" that are unsensitive to external perturbations. We identify characteristic features in the infrared regime that may be used as a stacking-order fingerprint for the mixed stacking tetralayer and the trilayer polytypes caused by a strong double resonance effect. Further to this, we find that the tetralayers systematically produce an SHG response that is significantly larger as compared to the trilayers. We then studied the SHG signal by the tetralayer polytypes in the terahertz regime and demonstrated the signal is highly sensitive the environmental conditions. Furthermore, we also find that accidental doping of graphene will strongly suppress the SHG signal in this regime. The above findings emphasize the need for a spectral approach to the identification of stacking order by SHG. Thus, measurements at one frequency are insufficient to confidently identify the stacking order due to the environmental sensitivities, since SHG can be readily induced with a comparable magnitude in the centrosymmetric polytypes through external symmetry-breaking.

Title: Classification of Magnetism and Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals
Authors: Zhi-Yan Shao, Chen Lu, Zhiming Pan, Yu-Bo Liu, Fan Yang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, an unconventional magnetic phase characterized by zero net magnetism and a spin-split electronic band, has been studied exclusively in conventional crystalline materials. In this work, we extend the theoretical framework of altermagnetism to quasicrystals (QCs), which lack translational symmetry. We classify magnetic phases in 2D QCs with $n$-fold rotational symmetry without spin-orbit coupling, by using the irreducible representation (IRRP) of the $D_n$ point group. Based on symmetry analysis, we propose the conjecture that magnetic phases corresponding to 1D non-identity IRRPs are generally altermagnetic, with the exception of those possessing parity-time symmetry. To verify our conjecture, we take the Hubbard model as an example and develop a systematic approach to determine the magnetic pattern in the QC, which effectively avoids getting trapped at local energy minima. Consequently, our tests for the Hubbard model on various QCs with different symmetries are unexceptionally consistent with our proposal. Our work highlights the QC as a platform where the altermagnetism is common among magnetic phases.

Authors: Rahul Marchand, Lucas Schorling, Cornelius Carlsson, Jonas Schuff, Barnaby van Straaten, Taylor L. Patti, Federico Fedele, Joshua Ziegler, Parth Girdhar, Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Natalia Ares
Abstract: Transformer models and end-to-end learning frameworks are rapidly revolutionizing the field of artificial intelligence. In this work, we apply object detection transformers to analyze charge stability diagrams in semiconductor quantum dot arrays, a key task for achieving scalability with spin-based quantum computing. Specifically, our model identifies triple points and their connectivity, which is crucial for virtual gate calibration, charge state initialization, drift correction, and pulse sequencing. We show that it surpasses convolutional neural networks in performance on three different spin qubit architectures, all without the need for retraining. In contrast to existing approaches, our method significantly reduces complexity and runtime, while enhancing generalizability. The results highlight the potential of transformer-based end-to-end learning frameworks as a foundation for a scalable, device- and architecture-agnostic tool for control and tuning of quantum dot devices.

Title: Orientation dependent anomalous Hall and spin Hall currents at the junctions of altermagnets with $p$-wave magnets
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We study charge and spin transport across a junction between an altermagnet (AM) and a $p$-wave magnet (PM) using a continuum model with boundary conditions tailored to the spin-split band structures of the two materials. Remarkably, although neither AM nor PM is spin-polarized, we find that the junction supports finite spin currents both longitudinally and transversely. We compute the longitudinal and transverse charge and spin conductivities as functions of the crystallographic orientations and the relative angle between the Néel vectors of AM and PM. Our results reveal that transverse charge and spin conductivities can be finite even when the longitudinal charge conductivity vanishes. For suitable parameter choices and orientation angles, the transverse conductivities are more prominent than the longitudinal ones. The origin of these effects lies in the matching and mismatching of transverse momentum modes ($k_y$) across the junction combined with the spin-dependent band splitting in AM and PM. Furthermore, while the transverse charge conductivity may cancel for certain orientations, the transverse spin conductivity remains finite due to unequal contributions of opposite $k_y$ channels. These findings highlight altermagnet/$p$-wave magnet junctions as a promising platform for tunable generation and control of transverse charge and spin currents driven purely by crystallographic orientation and spin structure.

Title: Exploring the Landscape of Non-Equilibrium Memories with Neural Cellular Automata
Authors: Ethan Lake, Ehsan Pajouheshgar
Abstract: We investigate the landscape of many-body memories: families of local non-equilibrium dynamics that retain information about their initial conditions for thermodynamically long time scales, even in the presence of arbitrary perturbations. In two dimensions, the only well-studied memory is Toom's rule. Using a combination of rigorous proofs and machine learning methods, we show that the landscape of 2D memories is in fact quite vast. We discover memories that correct errors in ways qualitatively distinct from Toom's rule, have ordered phases stabilized by fluctuations, and preserve information only in the presence of noise. Taken together, our results show that physical systems can perform robust information storage in many distinct ways, and demonstrate that the physics of many-body memories is richer than previously realized. Interactive visualizations of the dynamics studied in this work are available at this https URL.

Title: Regularized Perturbation Theory for Ab initio Solids
Authors: Meng-Fu Chen, Jinghong Zhang, Hieu Q. Dinh, Adam Rettig, Joonho Lee
Abstract: Second-order Moller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2) for ab initio simulations of solids is often limited by divergence or over-correlation issues, particularly in metallic, narrow-gap, and dispersion-stabilized systems. We develop and assess three regularized second-order perturbation theories: $\kappa$-MP2, $\sigma$-MP2, and the size-consistent Brillouin-Wigner approach (BW-s2), across metals, semiconductors, molecular crystals, and rare gas solids. BW-s2 achieves high accuracy for cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli in metals, semiconductors, and molecular crystals, rivaling or surpassing coupled-cluster with singles and doubles at lower cost. In rare gas solids, where MP2 already underbinds, $\kappa$-MP2 does not make the results much worse while BW-s2 struggles. These results illustrate both the potential and the limitations of regularized perturbation theory for efficient and accurate solid-state simulations. While broader testing is warranted, BW-s2($\alpha$ = 2) appears particularly promising, with possible advantages over modern random-phase approximations and coupled-cluster theory.

Title: PyKirigami: An interactive Python simulator for kirigami metamaterials
Authors: Qinghai Jiang, Gary P. T. Choi
Abstract: In recent years, the concept of kirigami has been used in creating deployable structures for various scientific and technological applications. While the design of kirigami metamaterials has been widely studied, the simulation of the deployment and shape transformation process is less explored. In this work, we develop PyKirigami, an efficient Python-based open-source computational tool for the deployment simulation of kirigami metamaterials. In particular, our tool is capable of simulating both two- and three-dimensional deployments of a large variety of kirigami metamaterials with different geometric, topological, and physical properties. Altogether, our work paves a new way for the modelling and design of shape-morphing mechanical metamaterials.

Title: Skyrmion Lattice Order Controlled by Confinement Geometry
Authors: Raphael Gruber, Jan Rothörl, Simon M. Fröhlich, Maarten A. Brems, Fabian Kammerbauer, Maria-Andromachi Syskaki, Elizabeth M. Jefremovas, Sachin Krishnia, Asle Sudbø, Peter Virnau, Mathias Kläui
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions forming two-dimensional (2D) lattices provide a versatile platform for investigating phase transitions predicted by Kosterlitz-Thouless-Halperin-Nelson-Young (KTHNY) theory. While 2D melting in skyrmion systems has been demonstrated, achieving controlled ordering in skyrmion lattices remains challenging due to pinning effects from a non-uniform energy landscape, which often results in polycrystalline structures. Skyrmions in thin films, however, offer thermal diffusion with high tunability and can be directly imaged via Kerr microscopy, enabling real-time observation of their dynamics. To regulate lattice order in such flexible systems, we introduce geometric confinements of varying shapes. Combining Kerr microscopy experiments with Thiele model simulations, we demonstrate that confinement geometry critically influences lattice order. Specifically, hexagonal confinements commensurate with the skyrmion lattice stabilize monodomain hexagonal ordering, while incommensurate geometries induce domain formation and reduce overall order. Understanding these boundary-driven effects is essential for advancing the study of 2D phase behavior and for the design of skyrmion-based spintronic applications, ranging from memory devices to unconventional computing architectures.

Title: Defect Anomalies, a Spin-Flux Duality, and Boson-Kondo Problems
Authors: Zohar Komargodski, Fedor K. Popov, Brandon C. Rayhaun
Abstract: We show that the infrared phases of certain line defects in 2+1d quantum field theories are determined by anomalies, including anomalies in the space of defect coupling constants, together with a symmetry-refined corollary of the $g$-theorem. As an example, we prove that the spin-$1/2$ impurities in the 2+1d critical $O(2)$ and $O(3)$ models (known respectively as the Halon and Boson-Kondo defects) flow to non-trivial conformal line operators in the IR, and we supply evidence that the same extends to all spin $s$. We also argue that, under particle/vortex duality, the Halon impurity is exchanged with the $\pi$-flux vortex line leading to spin-flux duality, a proposal which we test with a detailed matching of symmetries, anomalies, and phases. Finally, we write down quantum lattice Hamiltonians which can be used to test our predictions, and give an argument on the lattice in favor of spin-flux duality.

Title: A cell-level model to predict the spatiotemporal dynamics of neurodegenerative disease
Authors: Shih-Huan Huang, Matthew W. Cotton, Tuomas P.J. Knowles, David Klenerman, Georg Meisl
Abstract: A central challenge in modeling neurodegenerative diseases is connecting cellular-level mechanisms to tissue-level pathology, in particular to determine whether pathology is driven primarily by cell-autonomous triggers or by propagation from cells that are already in a pathological, runaway aggregation state. To bridge this gap, we here develop a bottom-up physical model that explicitly incorporates these two fundamental cell-level drivers of protein aggregation dynamics. We show that our model naturally explains the characteristic long, slow development of pathology followed by a rapid acceleration, a hallmark of many neurodegenerative diseases. Furthermore, the model reveals the existence of a critical switch point at which the system's dynamics transition from being dominated by slow, spontaneous formation of diseased cells to being driven by fast propagation. This framework provides a robust physical foundation for interpreting pathological data and offers a method to predict which class of therapeutic strategies is best matched to the underlying drivers of a specific disease.

Title: Attosecond high-harmonic interferometry probes orbital- and band-dependent dipole phase in magnesium oxide
Authors: Nataliia Kuzkova, Pieter J. van Essen, Brian de Keijzer, Rui E. F. Silva, Alvaro Jimenez Galan, Peter M. Kraus
Abstract: Control over the spatial coherence, wavefront, and focusability of emitted light relies on understanding the intrinsic phase of the emission process, and vice versa, measuring phase can reveal insights about microscopic generation mechanisms. A thorough understanding of the origin of the dipole phase in solid-state high-harmonic generation is currently missing. Here, by employing attosecond interferometry with phase-locked XUV pulses, we directly assess the intensity- and frequency-dependent dipole phases in magnesium oxide (MgO) in solid-state HHG. We also quantify a nonlinear phase shift of the fundamental and disentangle its contribution from the dipole phase. Theoretical models (analytical, two-band, and full-band numerical simulations) support our results. The analytical approach aids future solid-state HHG experiments and simulations, while the full numerical model details orbital- and band-resolved current contributions to the dipole phase. Our research delivers the first combined quantitative measurement and rigorous theoretical description of the harmonic emission phase in solids.

Title: Quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the nuclear shell model by the complex Langevin method
Authors: Yuhma Asano, Yuta Ito, Jun Nishimura, Noritaka Shimizu
Abstract: The nuclear shell model is known to describe the properties of various nuclei extremely well. However, the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations cannot be applied to it with general interactions due to the sign problem. The model has therefore been investigated primarily by variational methods, where the accuracy of the results depends crucially on the ansatz for the wave function. Here we perform the auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo calculations in the case of small systems at finite temperature using the complex Langevin method (CLM), which has been successfully applied to various interesting systems with the sign problem over the decade. In particular, we show the existence of a parameter region in which the validity criterion for the CLM is satisfied and the expectation value of the energy obtained by exact diagonalization is correctly reproduced. Thus the CLM can be a complementary approach to the variational method for large systems.

Title: Re-Engineering Hematite: Synergistic Co-Doping Routes to Efficient Solar Water Splitting
Authors: Abdul Ahad Mamun, Muhammad Anisuzzaman Talukder
Abstract: Solar-driven water electrolysis requires high-performance photoelectrodes that exhibit excellent photoabsorption, superior charge transport, and optimized thermal management. In this work, we conducted a first-principles investigation to explore optimized doping conditions for hematite ($\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$) by incorporating boron (B), yttrium (Y), and niobium (Nb) mono-dopants, as well as (B, Y) and (B, Nb) co-dopants. To identify the optimal dopant elements and concentrations, we evaluated electronic charge transport, thermal properties, and magnetic susceptibility over a temperature ($T$) range of 300 to 900 K and doping densities ($N$) from $10^{19}$ to $10^{21}$ cm$^{-3}$. The B-doped, (B, Y)-doped, and (B, Nb)-doped $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes showed significantly reduced band gap energy ($E_g$) relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. In comparison, Y and Nb dopants only slightly reduced $E_g$ relative to $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$. While B doping introduced impurity states near the Fermi level that limited thermoelectric charge transport, $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$ photoelectrodes doped by other elements exhibited notable improvements, including enhanced visible-light absorption, increased carrier concentration, improved electrical conductivity ($\sigma$), and efficient thermal management. Additionally, these doped photoelectrodes exhibited a remarkable increase in Pauli magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) by two orders of magnitude compared to pristine $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, indicating exciting potential for generating spin-selective polarized currents. Overall, our findings revealed that the co-doping conditions are the most effective for enhancing the performance of $\alpha$-Fe$_2$O$_3$, providing a low-cost and high-efficiency solution for sustainable green hydrogen (H$_2$) generation in photocatalytic water splitting.

Title: Identity and Quantify Various Dissipation Mechanisms of Josephson Junction in Superconducting Circuits
Authors: Hao Deng, Huijuan Zhan, Lijuan Hu, Hui-Hai Zhao, Ran Gao, Kannan Lu, Xizheng Ma, Zhijun Song, Fei Wang, Tenghui Wang, Feng Wu, Tian Xia, Gengyan Zhang, Xiaohang Zhang, Chunqing Deng
Abstract: Pinpointing the dissipation mechanisms and evaluating their impacts to the performance of Josephson junction (JJ) are crucial for its application in superconducting circuits. In this work, we demonstrate the junction-embedded resonator (JER) as a platform which enables us to identify and quantify various dissipation mechanisms of JJ. JER is constructed by embedding JJ in the middle of an open-circuit, 1/2 {\lambda} transmission-line resonator. When the 1st and 2nd harmonics of JER are excited, JJ experiences different boundary conditions, and is dominated by internal and external dissipations, respectively. We systematically study these 2 dissipation mechanisms of JJ by varying the JJ area and number. Our results unveil the completely different behaviors of these 2 dissipation mechanisms, and quantitatively characterize their contributions, shedding a light on the direction of JJ optimization in various applications.

Title: Dirac monopole magnets in non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Haiyang Yu, Tao Jiang, Li-Chen Zhao
Abstract: We theoretically establish that non-Hermitian perturbations induce a topological transformation of point-like Dirac monopoles into extended monopole distributions, characterized by distinct charge configurations emergent from three distinct Berry connection forms. Using piecewise adiabatic evolution, we confirm the validity of these configurations through observations of complex geometric phases. Most critically, we find a quantitative relation $\Delta \phi_d = \Delta \phi_g$, which quantifies how cumulative minute energy differences (\(\Delta \phi_d\)) manifest as geometric phase shifts (\(\Delta \phi_g\)) uniquely in non-Hermitian systems. We further propose a scheme leveraging soliton dynamics in dissipative two-component Bose-Einstein condensates, enabling direct measurement of these topological signatures. These results establish a milestone for understanding Dirac monopole charge distributions and measuring complex geometric phases in non-Hermitian systems, with far-reaching implications for topological quantum computing and non-Hermitian photonics.

Title: Non-Commutative weak measurements: Entanglement, Symmetry Breaking, and the Role of Readout
Authors: Yuanchen Zhao, Li Rao, Dong E. Liu
Abstract: The preparation of long-range entangled (LRE) states via quantum measurements is a promising strategy, yet its stability against realistic, non-commuting measurement noise remains a critical open question. Here, we systematically investigate the rich phase structure emerging from a minimal model of competing, non-commuting weak measurements: nearest-neighbor Ising ($Z_iZ_j$) and single-qubit transverse ($X_i$) operators. We analyze three experimentally relevant scenarios based on which measurement outcomes are read out: complete readout, no readout, and partial readout. Using a replica mean-field theory for higher dimensions, complemented by numerical simulations in one dimension, we derive the complete finite-time and stationary phase diagrams. Our analysis reveals a striking dependence on the readout protocol. Complete readout yields a direct transition between a short-range entangled (SRE) phase and a pure LRE phase. No readout (pure decoherence) precludes entanglement but exhibits a strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking (SWSSB) transition into a classically ordered mixed state. Most intriguingly, partial readout interpolates between these limits, featuring a mixed-state phase transition where the system can become trapped in the SWSSB phase or, for weaker non-commutativity, undergo successive symmetry breaking to reach a mixed LRE phase. A novel technical contribution is the use of a channel-fidelity-based partition function that allows us to simultaneously characterize both entanglement and SWSSB order, revealing a deep interplay between them in the replica limit. These results provide a cohesive picture for understanding measurement phase transitions, SWSSB, and mixed-state phase transitions, offering crucial insights for designing robust state preparation protocols on noisy quantum devices.

Title: Discovering correlations between metal foam thermal characteristics and non-Fourier behavior
Authors: Anna Fehér, Dániel Cseh, Róbert Kovács
Abstract: Due to their low density and large specific surface area, metal foams are increasingly used as cellular materials that combine excellent structural and thermal properties. Their cellular structure makes them particularly suitable for use in heat exchangers, insulation, and fire protection layers. The heat transport that takes place within them is a complex phenomenon characterized by the simultaneous presence of heat conduction, heat transfer, and heat radiation, making their modeling a significant challenge. The aim of the research is to develop a one-dimensional, time-dependent, discrete numerical model capable of describing the effective thermal behavior of metal foams. The model takes into account heat conduction through the solid phase, conductive heat transfer in the closed cavities, thermal radiation between the pore walls, and by-passing heat conduction around the cavity. The results highlight that geometric features such as cavity size and arrangement have a significant impact on temperature distribution and confirm that classical Fourier-based models are not accurately applicable to porous materials, but the Guyer--Krumhansl equation is an adequate candidate. Furthermore, we correlated the static and dynamic thermal diffusivity with the metal foam parameters, showing a significant sensitivity to the cavity thermal attributes.

Title: Deterministic Control of Photon-Number Probabilities via Phase-Controlled Quantum Interference
Authors: Sang Kyu Kim, Eduardo Zubizarreta Casalengua, Yeji Sim, Friedrich Sbresny, Carolin Calcagno, Hubert Riedl, Jonathan J. Finley, Elena del Valle, Carlos Antón-Solanas, Kai Müller, Lukas Hanschke
Abstract: Deterministically tailoring optical Fock states beyond the single-photon level is crucial for boson sampling, loss-tolerant photonic qubits, and quantum-enhanced sensing, however has yet remained elusive. Here, we report an all-linear-optical protocol that converts a resonantly driven single-photon emitter into a deterministic generator of vacuum--single-photon--two-photon states. A phase-stabilized, path-unbalanced Mach-Zehnder interferometer combines vacuum--single-photon interference and Hong-Ou-Mandel effect, providing two knobs to shape photon-number probabilities. By tuning these knobs, we observe a dynamic transition from antibunching to strong bunching in correlation measurements. A fully quantum-mechanical, discrete time-bin model maps these results onto the tailored photon statistics. The same framework predicts that two indistinguishable emitters would extend the accessible space to deterministic NOON states and single-photon filtering. This protocol relying on linear optics and available single-photon sources provides a scalable, chip-compatible, and platform-independent route to on-demand and deterministic few-photon resources for quantum metrology, photonic computing, as well as long-distance quantum networks.

Authors: Philipp K. Jenke, Saad Abdullah, Andrew P. Weber, Álvaro Rodríguez Echarri, Fadil Iyikanat, Vahagn Mkhitaryan, Frederik Schiller, J. Enrique Ortega, Philip Walther, F. Javier García de Abajo, Lee A. Rozema
Abstract: The inherently weak nonlinear optical response of bulk materials remains a fundamental limitation in advancing photonic technologies. Nanophotonics addresses this challenge by tailoring the size and morphology of nanostructures to manipulate the optical near field, thus modulating the nonlinear response. Here, we explore a complementary strategy based on engineering the electronic band structure in the mesoscopic regime to enhance optical nonlinearities. Specifically, we demonstrate an increase in second-harmonic generation (SHG) from crystalline silver films as their thickness is reduced down to just a few atomic monolayers. Operating at the boundary between bulk and two-dimensional systems, these ultra-thin films exhibit a pronounced enhancement of SHG with decreasing thickness. This enhancement stems from quantum confinement effects that modify the interaction between electronic states and incident light, which we explain based on quantum-mechanical calculation. Our atomically-thin crystalline silver films provide a new means to overcome the small interaction volumes inherent to nanophotonic platforms, enabling efficient nanoscale nonlinear optics with potential applications in photonics, sensing, and quantum technologies.

Title: Quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in continuously monitored boundary time crystals
Authors: Eoin O'Connor, Victor Montenegro, Francesco Albarelli, Matteo G. A. Paris, Abolfazl Bayat, Marco G. Genoni
Abstract: We investigate quantum-enhanced parameter estimation in boundary time crystals (BTCs) via continuous monitoring. By analytically deriving the global quantum Fisher information rate, we show that in the time-crystal phase the ultimate precision exhibits a cubic scaling with the system size, $f_{\mathrm{global}}\sim N^3$, surpassing both the sensitivity at the critical point and the standard quantum limit (SQL). We then numerically demonstrate that this bound can be attained already at finite $N$ using experimentally accessible strategies: continuous photodetection and, in particular, continuous homodyne detection. Moving towards realistic implementations, we derive the fundamental precision limits for inefficient detection ($\eta<1$). While inefficiencies asymptotically restore SQL scaling, a constant-factor quantum advantage remains possible, diverging as $\eta\!\to\!1$. Numerical simulations show that homodyne detection outperforms photodetection in approaching the ultimate bound and consistently provides a collective advantage over independent single-qubit protocols, which grows with $N$.

Title: Universal Statistics of Charges Exchanges in Non-Abelian Quantum Transport
Authors: Matteo Scandi, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: We derive detailed and intergral fluctuation relations as well as a Thermodynamic Uncertainty Relation constraining the exchange statistics of an arbitrary number of non-commuting conserved quantities among two quantum systems in transport setups arbitrary far from equilibrium. These universal relations, valid without the need of any efficacy parameter, extend the well-known heat exchange fluctuation theorems for energy and particle transport to the case of non-Abelian quantum transport, where the non-commutativity of the charges allows bending standard thermodynamic rules. In particular, we show that this can lead to apparent violations of the second law of thermodynamics, it enhances precision in the current fluctuations, and it allows for the inversion of all currents against their affinity biases.

Abstract: CP2K is a versatile open-source software package for simulations across a wide range of atomistic systems, from isolated molecules in the gas phase to low-dimensional functional materials and interfaces, as well as highly symmetric crystalline solids, disordered amorphous glasses, and weakly interacting soft-matter systems in the liquid state and in solution. This review highlights CP2K's capabilities for computing both static and dynamical properties using quantum-mechanical and classical simulation methods. In contrast to the accompanying theory and code paper [J. Chem. Phys. 152, 194103 (2020)], the focus here is on the practical usage and applications of CP2K, with underlying theoretical concepts introduced only as needed.

Title: Nonequilibrium protein complexes as molecular automata
Authors: Jan Kocka, Kabir Husain, Jaime Agudo-Canalejo
Abstract: Biology stores information and computes at the molecular scale, yet the ways in which it does so are often distinct from human-engineered computers. Mapping biological computation onto architectures familiar to computer science remains an outstanding challenge. Here, inspired by Crick's proposal for molecular memory, we analyse a thermodynamically-consistent model of a protein complex subject to driven, nonequilibrium enzymatic reactions. In the strongly driven limit, we find that the system maps onto a stochastic, asynchronous variant of cellular automata, where each rule corresponds to a different set of enzymes being present. We find a broad class of phenomena in these 'molecular automata' that can be exploited for molecular computation, including error-tolerant memory via multistable attractors, and long transients that can be used as molecular stopwatches. By systematically enumerating all possible dynamical rules, we identify those that allow molecular automata to implement simple computational architectures such as finite-state machines. Overall, our results provide a framework for engineering synthetic molecular automata, and offer a route to building protein-based computation in living cells.

Title: Low-Power Control of Resistance Switching Transitions in First-Order Memristors
Authors: Valeriy A. Slipko, Alon Ascoli, Fernando Corinto, Yuriy V. Pershin
Abstract: In many cases, the behavior of physical memristive devices can be relatively well captured by using a single internal state variable. This study investigates the low-power control of first-order memristive devices to derive the most energy-efficient protocols for programming their resistances. A unique yet general approach to optimizing the switching transitions in devices of this kind is introduced. For pedagogical purposes, without loss of generality, the proposed control paradigm is applied to a couple of differential algebraic equation sets for voltage-controlled devices, specifically Kvatinsky's Voltage ThrEshold Adaptive Memristor mathematical description and Miranda's and Sune's dynamic balance model. It is demonstrated that, depending upon intrinsic physical properties of the device, captured in the model formulas and parameter setting, and upon constraints on programming time and voltages, the optimal protocol for either of the two switching scenarios may require the application of a single square voltage pulse of height set to a certain level within the admissible range across a fraction or entire given programming time interval, or of some more involved voltage stimulus of unique polarity, including analogue continuous waveforms that can be approximated by trains of square voltage pulses of different heights, over the entire programming time interval. The practical implications of these research findings are significant, as the development of energy-efficient protocols to program memristive devices, resolving the so-called voltage-time dilemma in the device physics community, is a subject under intensive and extensive studies across the academic community and industry.

Title: Irreversibility and symmetry breaking in the creation and annihilation of defects in active living matter
Authors: Avraham Beer, Efraim Dov Neimand, Dom Corbett, Daniel J. G. Pearce, Gil Ariel, Victor Yashunsky
Abstract: Active living matter continuously creates and annihilates topological defects in a process that remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate these dynamics in two distinct active living systems, swarming bacteria and human bronchial epithelial cells. Despite their entirely different evolutionary origins, biological functions, and physical scales, both systems exhibit half-integer defects, consistent with the nematic phase. However, in contrast to active nematic theory, we find that defect creation and annihilation undergoes spatial symmetry breaking. We propose that this results from a fundamental dualism between nematic structural organization and generated polar forces, which are intrinsic to living systems. Furthermore, our estimation of entropy production reveals that creation and annihilation are not reversed processes. Our findings challenge conventional nematic models and emphasize the role of defect-mediated dynamics in non-equilibrium biological systems as a major source of entropy production.

Title: Cluster Expansion and Decay of Correlations for Multidimensional Long-Range Ising Models
Authors: Lucas Affonso, Rodrigo Bissacot, João Maia, João F. Rodrigues, Kelvyn Welsch
Abstract: We develop the cluster expansion for the multidimensional multiscaled contours defined by three of us. These contours are suitable for long-range Ising models with interaction $J_{xy}=J(|x-y|)= J/|x-y|^\alpha$, $J>0$, and $\alpha>d$. As an application of the convergence of the cluster expansion at low temperatures, we study the decay of the truncated two-point correlation functions, showing that the decay is algebraic with coefficient $\alpha$.

Title: Assessing the Reliability of Truncated Coupled Cluster Wavefunction: Estimating the Distance from the Exact Solution
Authors: Ádám Ganyecz, Zsolt Benedek, Klára Petrov, Gergely Barcza, András Olasz, Miklós A. Werner, Örs Legeza
Abstract: A new approach is proposed to assess the reliability of the truncated wavefunction methods by estimating the deviation from the full configuration interaction (FCI) wavefunction. While typical multireference diagnostics compare some derived property of the solution with the ideal picture of a single determinant, we try to answer a more practical question, how far is the solution from the exact one. Using the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) method to provide an approximate FCI solution for the self-consistently determined relevant active space, we compare the low-level CI expansions and one-body reduced density matrixes to determine the distance of the two solutions ($\tilde{d}_\Phi$, $\tilde{d}_\gamma$). We demonstrate the applicability of the approach for the CCSD method by benchmarking on the W4-17 dataset, as well as on transition metal-containing species. We also show that the presented moderate-cost, purely wavefunction-based metric is truly unique in the sense that it does not correlate with any popular multireference measures. We also explored the usage of CCSD natural orbitals ($\tilde{d}_{\gamma,\mathrm{NO}}$) and its effect on the active space size and the metric. The proposed diagnostic can also be applied to other wavefunction approximations, and it has the potential to provide a quality measure for post-Hartree-Fock procedures in general.

Title: Exact Solutions and Quantum Defect Theory for van der Waals Potentials in Ultracold Molecular Systems
Authors: Jianwen Jie, Shi Chen, Yue Chen, Ran Qi
Abstract: In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schrödinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.

Title: Exploring the third dimension in quantum confinement of surface electrons
Authors: Lu Lyu, Tobias Eul, Wei Yao, Jin Xiao, Mostafa Ashoush, Zakaria M. Abd El-Fattah, Ignacio Piquero-Zulaica, Johannes V. Barth, Martin Aeschlimann, Benjamin Stadtmüller
Abstract: Quantum confinement of surface electrons in two-dimensional metal-organic porous networks offers a powerful route to engineer electronic states for emerging quantum and spintronic technologies at the molecular scale. To date, such confinement has been understood primarily in terms of lateral, two-dimensional surface potential landscapes. Here, we demonstrate the pivotal role of vertical variations in the surface potential on the quantum confinement of surface electrons. We investigate the confinement behavior of both Shockley surface state and image potential state electrons with their distinct vertical electron density distributions in an exemplary Cu-T4PT metal-organic porous network on Cu(111). Advanced spectroscopic techniques reveal a substantial band renormalization for the image state electrons, manifested as a significant increase in their effective mass, whereas the Shockley state electrons remain almost unchanged. Such striking divergence is attributed to the distinct three-dimensional potential landscape of the Cu-T4PT network with a strong repulsive potential at the vertical position of the molecular backbone and leaky channels underneath the Cu coordination spheres. Our findings demonstrate the essential role of vertical potential engineering in designing quantum confined states and thus advance the control of electronic properties and quantum phenomena on the nanoscale.

Title: Revealing the Altermagnetism in Hematite via XMCD Imaging and Anomalous Hall Electrical Transport

Abstract: Altermagnets are a class of magnetic materials that exhibit unconventional transport properties, such as an anomalous Hall effect, despite having compensated sublattice magnetic moments. In this study, we report fundamental experimental evidence of the altermagnetic nature of hematite ($\alpha$-\ch{Fe2O3}), combining electrical transport with advanced XPEEM imaging with linear and circular dichroism contrast. Our measurements directly visualize the Néel vector's coupling to the crystal orientation, confirming hematite's altermagnetic order and its symmetry-driven transport behavior. Transport measurements reveal an anisotropic AHE with a pronounced crystal orientation dependence, including a sign inversion for specific Néel vector alignments. Supported by first-principles theoretical calculations, we explain how the interplay between collinear spin and crystal symmetry breaking drives the observed anomalous Hall effect. These findings establish hematite as an altermagnet, paving the way for experimental identification of altermagnetic materials and their integration into spintronic technologies.

Title: Resolving exciton and polariton multi-particle correlations in an optical microcavity in the strong coupling regime
Authors: Victoria Quirós-Cordero, Esteban Rojas-Gatjens, Martín Gómez-Dominguez, Hao Li, Carlo A. R. Perini, Natalie Stingelin, Juan-Pablo Correa-Baena, Eric R. Bittner, Ajay Ram Srimath Kandada, Carlos Silva-Acuña
Abstract: Multi-particle correlations of exciton-polaritons and reservoir-excitons in the strong light-matter coupling regime dictate the quantum dynamics of optical microcavities. In this letter, we examine the many-body exciton-polariton dynamics in a Fabry-Pérot microcavity of a two-dimensional metal-halide semiconductor over timescales involving polariton ($\ll 1$\,ps) and exciton ($\gg 1$\,ps) scattering. We find enhanced exciton nonlinear dynamics in the microcavity versus the bare semiconductor, concomitant with ultrafast polariton scattering dynamics. We measure, by means of coherent spectroscopy, the coupling between exciton-polaritons, bright excitons, and reservoir-excitons that highlight the complex scattering landscape that fundamentally drives polariton condensation.

Title: Scale locality of information flow in shell models of turbulence
Authors: Tomohiro Tanogami
Abstract: Turbulent fluctuations exhibit universal scaling laws that are independent of large-scale statistics. It is often explained that such universality is caused by the loss of information about large-scale statistics during the cascade process. In our previous study [T. Tanogami and R. Araki, Phys. Rev. Research 6, 013090 (2024)], we applied information thermodynamics to turbulence and proved that information of large-scale turbulent fluctuations is propagated to small scales. As a first step toward understanding how universality emerges at small scales under the influence of the information flow from large scales, here we investigate the scale locality of the information flow for shell models. First, we analytically show that the information flow can be decomposed into scale-local and scale-nonlocal parts. Then, by assuming the Kolmogorov hypothesis for the Kolmogorov multiplier, we prove that the scale-nonlocal part can be ignored compared to the scale-local part. This result implies that the information transfer from large to small scales occurs mainly through scale-local interactions, which is consistent with the scale locality of the energy cascade.

Title: Single-shot readout of the nuclear spin of an on-surface atom
Authors: Evert W. Stolte, Jinwon Lee, Hester G. Vennema, Rik Broekhoven, Esther Teng, Allard J. Katan, Lukas M. Veldman, Philip Willke, Sander Otte
Abstract: Nuclear spins owe their long-lived magnetic states to their excellent isolation from the environment. At the same time, a finite degree of interaction with their surroundings is necessary for reading and writing the spin state. Therefore, detailed knowledge of and control over the atomic environment of a nuclear spin is key to optimizing conditions for quantum information applications. While various platforms enabled single-shot readout of nuclear spins, their direct environments were either unknown or impossible to controllably modify on the atomic scale. Scanning tunnelling microscopy (STM), combined with electron spin resonance (ESR), provides atomic-scale information of individual nuclear spins via the hyperfine interaction. Here, we demonstrate single-shot readout of an individual $^{\text{49}}$Ti nuclear spin with an STM. Employing a pulsed measurement scheme, we find its lifetime to be in the order of seconds. Furthermore, we shed light on the pumping and relaxation mechanisms of the nuclear spin by investigating its response to both ESR driving and tunnelling current, which is supported by model calculations. These findings give an atomic-scale insight into the nature of nuclear spin relaxation and are relevant for the development of atomically assembled qubit platforms.

Title: Temperature-dependent discovery of BCC refractory multi-principal element alloys: Integrating deep learning and CALPHAD calculations
Authors: A. K. Shargh, C. D. Stiles, J. A. El-Awady
Abstract: Single-phase body-centered cubic (BCC) refractory multi-principal element alloys (RMPEAs) offer potential for developing alloys with exceptional strength. However, the compositional design space is immense. Exhaustively mapping this space with conventional CALculation of PHAse Diagrams (CALPHAD) is impractical because database coverage and run times scale poorly with millions of candidate chemistries. To address this, we train a deep-learning surrogate on CALPHAD outputs that preserves the thermodynamic fidelity while accelerating temperature-dependent phase-fraction predictions of RMPEA phases. The model achieves high accuracy in predicting phase fractions for up to eight distinct phases across different temperatures and offers a speedup of two orders of magnitude compared to CALPHAD. Using this model, we screen the Ti, Fe, Al, V, Ni, Nb and Zr elemental space for potentially stable single-phase BCC alloys at different annealing temperatures and extract design insights to guide the synthesis of new BCC RMPEAs in experiments. Finally, we develop an analytical model that enables rapid, interpretable identification of single-phase BCC RMPEAs.

Title: Impact of Thermal Effects on the Current-Tunable Electrical Transport in the Ferrimagnetic Semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$
Authors: Yiyue Zhang, Xin Jin, ZeYu Li, Kunya Yang, Linlin Wei, Xinrun Mi, Aifeng Wang, Xiaoyuan Zhou, Xiaolong Yang, Yisheng Chai, Mingquan He
Abstract: In the ferrimagnetic semiconductor Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$, a colossal magnetoresistance (CMR) is observed only when a magnetic field is applied along the magnetic hard axis ($\mathbf{H}\parallel c$). This phenomenon suggests an unconventional CMR mechanism potentially driven by the interplay between magnetism, topological band structure, and/or chiral orbital currents (COC). By comparing electrical resistance measurements using continuous direct currents and pulse currents, we found that the current-induced insulator-metal transition, supporting the COC-driven CMR mechanism, is likely a consequence of Joule heating effects. First-principles calculations reveal a pronounced band gap reduction upon tilting the magnetic moments toward the $c$-axis, accompanied by increased carrier concentration and Fermi velocity. Combining spin orientation-dependent electronic structure with Boltzmann transport theory, the calculated electrical resistance closely reproduces the CMR observed experimentally. These findings suggest that the CMR in Mn$_3$Si$_2$Te$_6$ stems primarily from band gap reduction induced by partial polarization of magnetic moments along the magnetic hard axis.

Title: Universal Wilson Loop Bound of Quantum Geometry
Authors: Jiabin Yu, Jonah Herzog-Arbeitman, B. Andrei Bernevig
Abstract: We define the absolute Wilson loop winding and prove that it bounds the (integrated) quantum metric from below. This Wilson loop lower bound naturally reproduces the known Chern and Euler bounds of the integrated quantum metric and provides an explicit lower bound of the integrated quantum metric due to the time-reversal protected $Z_2$ index, answering a hitherto open question. In general, the Wilson loop lower bound can be applied to any other topological invariants characterized by Wilson loop winding, such as the particle-hole $Z_2$ index. As physical consequences of the $Z_2$ bound, we show that the time-reversal $Z_2$ index bounds superfluid weight and optical conductivity from below and bounds the direct gap of a band insulator from above.

Title: Structural Anisotropy Stabilises Asymmetric Beating in Instability Driven Filaments
Authors: Bethany Clarke, Yongyun Hwang, Eric E Keaveny
Abstract: Asymmetries and anisotropies are widespread in biological systems, including in the structure and dynamics of cilia and eukaryotic flagella. These microscopic, hair-like appendages exhibit asymmetric beating patterns that break time-reversal symmetry needed to facilitate fluid transport at the cellular level. The intrinsic anisotropies in ciliary structure can promote preferential beating directions, further influencing their dynamics. In this study, we employ numerical simulation and bifurcation analysis of a mathematical model of a filament driven by a follower force at its tip to explore how intrinsic curvature and direction-dependent bending stiffnesses impact filament dynamics. Our results show that while intrinsic curvature is indeed able to induce asymmetric beating patterns when filament motion is restricted to a plane, this beating is unstable to out of plane perturbations. Furthermore, we find that a 3D whirling state seen for isotropic filament dynamics can be suppressed when sufficient asymmetry or anisotropy are introduced. Finally, for bending stiffness ratios as low as 2, we demonstrate that combining structural anisotropy with intrinsic curvature can stabilise asymmetric beating patterns, highlighting the crucial role of anisotropy in ciliary dynamics.

Title: Coherent suppression and dephasing-induced reentrance of high harmonics in Dirac materials
Authors: Wolfgang Hogger, Alexander Riedel, Debadrito Roy, Angelika Knothe, Cosimo Gorini, Juan-Diego Urbina, Klaus Richter
Abstract: High-harmonic generation in solids by intense laser pulses provides a fascinating platform for studying material properties and ultra-fast electron dynamics, where its coherent character is a central aspect. Using the semiconductor Bloch equations, we uncover a mechanism suppressing the high harmonic spectrum arising from the coherent superposition of intra- vs. inter-band contributions. We provide evidence for the generality of this phenomenon by extensive numerical simulations exploring the parameter space in gapped systems with both linear dispersion, such as for massive Dirac Fermions, and with quadratic dispersion, as e.g. for bilayer graphene. Moreover, we demonstrate that, upon increasing dephasing, destructive interference between intra- and inter-band contributions is lifted. This leads to reentrant behavior of suppressed high harmonics, i.e. a crossover from the characteristic spectral "shoulder" to a slowly decaying signal involving much higher harmonics.

Title: Integrating Density Functional Theory with Deep Neural Networks for Accurate Voltage Prediction in Alkali-Metal-Ion Battery Materials
Authors: Sk Mujaffar Hossain, Namitha Anna Koshi, Seung-Cheol Lee, G.P Das, Satadeep Bhattacharjee
Abstract: Accurate prediction of the voltage of battery materials plays a pivotal role in the advancement of energy storage technologies and the rational design of high-performance cathode materials. In this work, we present a deep neural network (DNN) model, built using PyTorch, to estimate the average voltage of cathode materials across Li-ion, Na-ion, and other alkali-metal-ion batteries. The model is trained on an extensive dataset from the Materials Project, incorporating a wide range of specific structural, physical, chemical, electronic, thermodynamic, and battery descriptors, ensuring a comprehensive representation of material properties. Our model exhibits strong predictive performance, as corroborated by first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The close alignment between the DNN predictions and the DFT outcomes highlights the robustness and accuracy of our machine learning framework to effectively select and identify viable battery materials. Using this validated model, we successfully proposed novel Na-ion battery compositions, with their predicted behavior confirmed by rigorous computational assessment. By seamlessly integrating data-driven prediction with first-principles validation, this study presents an effective framework that significantly accelerates the discovery and optimization of advanced battery materials, contributing to the development of more reliable and efficient energy storage technologies.

Title: Negative currents in Fabry-Pérot cavities are caused by interfering paths
Authors: Mrinmoyee Saha, Luca Horray, Pedro Portugal, Christian Flindt
Abstract: It has been predicted that the time-dependent current in a Fabry-Pérot cavity can turn negative even if the applied voltage pulses are always positive. It has also been suggested that the negative currents are related to interfering paths, however, an analytic description of this surprising phenomenon has so far been missing. Here we make use of Floquet scattering theory to demonstrate that the negative currents indeed are caused by the interference of scattering paths through the cavity with different numbers of roundtrips. Our analytic result can be tested in future experiments as it predicts exactly how the effect should be washed out by an increasing temperature. We show that a similar phenomenon is expected for the heat current, which may also turn negative.

Title: Learning phases with Quantum Monte Carlo simulation cell
Authors: Amrita Ghosh, Mugdha Sarkar, Ying-Jer Kao, Pochung Chen
Abstract: We propose the use of the "spin-opstring", derived from Stochastic Series Expansion Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations as machine learning input data. It offers a compact, memory-efficient representation of QMC simulation cells, combining the initial state with an operator string that encodes the state's evolution through imaginary time. Using supervised machine learning, we demonstrate the input's effectiveness in capturing both conventional and topological phase transitions. Additionally, we conduct a regression task to predict superfluid density, which reflects non-local properties of the quantum system, and achieve good accuracy. We also demonstrate the capability of spin-opstring data in transfer learning by training models on one quantum system and successfully predicting on another, as well as showing that models trained on smaller system sizes generalize well to larger ones. Finally, using two state-of-the-art interpretability techniques, Layer-wise Relevance Propagation and SHapley Additive exPlanations, we show that the machine learning models learn and rely on physically meaningful features from the input data. Together, these findings establish the spin-opstring as a broadly-applicable and interpretable input format for machine learning in quantum many-body physics.

Title: $t$-$J$ model for strongly correlated two-orbital systems: Application to bilayer nickelate superconductors
Authors: Tatsuya Kaneko, Masataka Kakoi, Kazuhiko Kuroki
Abstract: We derive a $t$-$J$ model applicable to strongly correlated two-orbital systems including bilayer nickelate superconductors. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we exclude the doubly occupied states, which raise the onsite Coulomb energy, and derive the resulting spin interactions from the two-orbital Hubbard model. We also introduce effective interactions attributed to the interorbital Coulomb interaction. To adapt the effective model to bilayer nickelates that exhibit high-temperature superconductivity, we quantitatively evaluate the strengths of the spin interactions based on the hopping parameters in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Considering the evaluated effective interactions, we propose a simplified $t$-$J$ model for bilayer nickelate superconductors.

Title: Indirect Tunneling Enabled Spontaneous Time-Reversal Symmetry Breaking and Josephson Diode Effect in TiN/Al$_2$O$_3$/Hf$_{0.8}$Zr$_{0.2}$O$_2$/Nb tunnel junctions
Authors: Shaoqing Ding, Jinyuan Yao, Zhen Bi, Quyen Tran, Bangzhi Liu, Qi Li, Susan Trolier-McKinstry, Thomas N. Jackson, Ying Liu
Abstract: Josephson diode (JD) effect found in Josephson tunnel junctions (JTJs) has attracted a great deal of attention due to its importance for developing superconducting circuitry based quantum technologies. So far, the highly desirable electrical control of the JD effect has not been demonstrated in any JTJ prepared by techniques used in semiconductor industry. We report the fabrication of JTJs featuring a composite tunnel barrier of Al$_2$O$_3$ and Hf$_{\mathrm{0.8}}$Zr$_\mathrm{0.2}$O$_2$ prepared by complementary-metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) compatible atomic layer deposition (ALD). These JTJs were found to show the JD effect in nominally zero magnetic fields with the nonreciprocity controllable using an electric training current, yielding a surprisingly large diode efficiency not achieved previously. The quasiparticle tunneling, through which the Josephson coupling in a JTJ is established, was found to show no nonreciprocity. We attribute these observations to the simultaneous presence of positive and negative Josephson couplings, with the latter originating from indirect tunneling. The resulted spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking and the double-minima washboard potential for the ensemble averaged phase difference in the resistively and capacitively shunted junction (RCSJ) model are shown to fully account for the experimentally observed JD effect.

Title: Vibrational Energy Dissipation in Non-Contact Single-Molecule Junctions Governed by Local Geometry and Electronic Structure
Authors: Lukas Hörmann, Reinhard J. Maurer
Abstract: The vibrational dynamics of adsorbate molecules in single-molecule junctions depend critically on the geometric structure and electronic interactions between molecule and substrate. Vibrations, excited mechanochemically or by external stimuli, dissipate energy into substrate electrons and phonons. Energy dissipation leads to the broadening of spectral lines, vibrational lifetimes, and the coupling between molecular and substrate phonons. It affects molecular manipulation, giving rise to nanoscale friction, and contributes to scanning probe and surface spectroscopy signals. We present an approach to disentangle adsorbate vibrational dynamics in non-contact junctions by employing density functional theory, machine learning, and non-adiabatic molecular dynamics. Focusing on the CO-functionalised Cu surfaces representing a single-molecule junction, a widely studied system in scanning probe and energy dissipation experiments, we reveal strong vibrational mode specificity governed by the interplay of electron-phonon and phonon-phonon coupling. Electron-phonon relaxation rates vary by two orders of magnitude between modes and sensitively depend on the tip-substrate geometry. We find evidence of a weak non-additive effect between both energy dissipation channels, where electron-phonon coupling enhances phonon-phonon coupling. Our predicted vibrational lifetimes agree with infrared spectroscopy and helium scattering experiments. Finally, we outline how our findings can inform and enhance scanning probe experiments.

Title: Analytical model for non-linear magnetotransport in viscous electron fluid
Authors: P. S. Alekseev, M. A. Semina
Abstract: We develop an analytical theoretical model for non-linear hydrodynamic magnetotransport of two-dimensional (2D) electron fluid with strong pair correlations in the electron dynamics. Within classical kinetics of 2D electrons, such correlations are described as subsequent ``extended'' collisions of the same electrons, temporarily joined in pairs. Corresponding correlation-induced retarded terms in the fluid dynamic equations can be described for slow flows as the dependence of the electron fluid viscosity on the flow velocity gradient, that is Non-Newtonian behavior of the fluid. We analytically calculate flow profiles in long samples in a stationary highly non-linear regime and the corresponding magnetoresistance. Pair correlations lead to a characteristic non-monotonic dependence of the differential resistance on magnetic field. We compare our results with experimental data on non-linear magnetotransport of high-purity GaAs quantum wells; we conclude that our model can be responsible for a part of the observed features of the differential magnetoresistance.

Title: Vortex and fractional quantum Hall phases in a rotating anisotropic Bose gas
Authors: Umut Tanyeri, Ahmed Kallushi, Rıfat Onur Umucalılar, Ahmet Keleş
Abstract: Realizing fractional quantum Hall (FQH) states in ultracold atomic systems remains a major goal despite numerous experimental advances in the last few decades. Recent progress in trap anisotropy control under rapid rotation has renewed interest in ultracold atomic FQH physics, enabling experiments that impart much larger angular momentum per particle and offer in-situ imaging with resolution finer than the cyclotron orbit size. In this paper, we present a theoretical investigation of a rapidly rotating anisotropic Bose gas. By projecting the full Hamiltonian, including both kinetic and interaction terms, onto the lowest Landau level, we derive a compact two-parameter model that captures the effects of interaction strength, rotation rate, and anisotropy. Using exact diagonalization and density matrix renormalization group, we obtain a phase diagram that features broken-symmetry phases and topologically ordered quantum Hall states, while also highlighting the distinctive physics arising from the system's edges. Our results demonstrate the potential for future theoretical and experimental exploration of anisotropic quantum fluids, offering a unified framework for weakly interacting Bose condensates, vortex matter, and strongly correlated topological phases.

Title: Symmetry-broken ground state and phonon mediated superconductivity in Kagome CsV$_3$Sb$_5$
Authors: Manex Alkorta, Martin Gutierrez-Amigo, Ðorđe Dangić, Chunyu Guo, Philip J. W. Moll, Maia G. Vergniory, Ion Errea
Abstract: The newly discovered family of non-magnetic Kagome metals AV$_3$Sb$_5$ (A=K,Rb,Cs) provides a unique platform for exploring the interplay between charge density wave (CDW) order, superconductivity, non-trivial topology, and spontaneous time-reversal symmetry breaking. Although characterizing the CDW phase is essential for understanding and modeling these exotic phenomena, its nature remains unresolved. In this work, we employ first-principles free-energy calculations, accounting for both ionic kinetic energy and anharmonic effects, to resolve the atomistic phase diagram of CsV$_3$Sb$_5$ and its charge ordering structure. Our results uncover that the CDW ground state is formed by reconstructed vanadium Kagome layers in a triangular hexagonal pattern, featuring energetically degenerate different stacking orders. This accounts for the various out-of-plane modulations observed experimentally and supports the coexistence of multiple domains. The discovered symmetry-broken ground state is consistent with the absence of any electronic anisotropy in transport experiments. By combining anharmonic phonons with the calculation of electron-phonon matrix elements, we predict a superconducting critical temperature for the CDW phase in agreement with experiments, showing that superconductivity is phonon mediated. These findings not only resolve a long-standing structural puzzle, but also clarify the impact of the CDW in superconductivity, highlighting its fundamental importance in shaping the low-temperature quantum phase diagram of Kagome metals.

Title: Understanding Flow Behaviors of Supercooled Liquids by Embodying Solid-Liquid Duality at Particle Level
Authors: Dong-Xu Yu, Ke-Qi Zeng, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Understanding the flow behaviors of supercooled liquids presents a major challenge in liquid-state physics due to the strong nonlinearity and rich phenomena. To unravel this complexity, we introduce the concept of local configurational relaxation time $\tau_\rm{LC}$, which allows us to embody the solid-liquid duality, proposed by Maxwell for phenomenologically describing materials' response to external load, at the particle level. The spatial distribution of $\tau_\rm{LC}$ in flow is heterogeneous. Depending on the comparison between the local mobility measured by $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the external shear rate, the shear response of local regions is either solid-like or liquid-like. In this way, $\tau_\rm{LC}$ plays a role similar to the Maxwell time. By applying this microscopic solid-liquid duality to different conditions of shear flow with a wide range of shear rates, we describe the emergence of shear thinning in steady shear, and predict the major characteristics of the transient response to start-up shear. Furthermore, we reveal a clear structural foundation for $\tau_\rm{LC}$ and the solid-liquid duality associated with it by introducing an order parameter extracted from local configuration. Thus, we establish a framework that connects microscopic structure, dynamics, local mechanical response, and flow behaviors for supercooled liquids. Finally, we rationalize our framework in terms of activations from energy basins that are facilitated by shear. This model illustrates how local structure, convection and thermal activation collectively determine $\tau_\rm{LC}$. Notably, it predicts two distinct response groups, which well correspond to the microscopic solid-liquid duality.

Title: Bridging Electrostatic Screening and Ion Transport in Lithium Salt-Doped Ionic Liquids
Authors: Hyungshick Park, Bong June Sung, Jeongmin Kim
Abstract: Alkali salt-doped ionic liquids are emerging as promising electrolyte systems for energy applications, owing to their excellent interfacial stability. To address their limited ionic conductivity, various strategies have been proposed, including modifying the ion solvation environment and enhancing the transport of selected ions (e.g., Li$^+$). Despite the pivotal role of electrostatic interactions in determining key physicochemical properties, their influence on ion transport in such systems has received relatively little attention. In this work, we investigate the connection between ion transport and electrostatic screening using atomistic molecular dynamics simulations of 1-butyl-1-methylpyrrolidinium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide ([pyr$_{14}$][TFSI]) doped with lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (LiTFSI) at molar fractions x$_{LiTFSI}$ $\le$ 0.3. We find that the charge-charge and density-density correlation functions exhibit oscillatory exponential decay, indicating that LiTFSI doped [pyr$_{14}$][TFSI] is a charge- and mass-dense system. The electrostatic screening length decreases with increasing LiTFSI concentration, whereas the decay length of the density-density correlation functions remains nearly unchanged. Notably, we find that the x$_{LiTFSI}$-sensitive screening length serves as a central length scale for disentangling species-specific contributions of ion pairs to collective ion transport upon LiTFSI doping. This framework provides a unifying perspective on the interplay between structure and transport in ionic liquid systems.

Title: Unifying renormalized and bare viscosity in two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Kazuma Yokota, Masato Itami, Shin-ichi Sasa
Abstract: Fluctuating hydrodynamics provides a framework connecting mesoscopic fluctuations with macroscopic transport behavior. To bridge mesoscopic and macroscopic transport from microscopic dynamics, we introduce a wavenumber-dependent viscosity, defined via the equilibrium correlation of time-averaged Fourier components of the fine-grained shear stress field, as a finite-wavevector extension of the Green--Kubo formula. Two-dimensional molecular dynamics simulations reveal its small-wavenumber divergence characteristic of the renormalized viscosity, while its large-wavenumber behavior determines the bare viscosity, thereby establishing a link between mesoscopic and macroscopic transport based on microscopic dynamics.

Title: Self-assembled fluorescent nanodiamond layers for quantum imaging
Authors: Katherine Chea, Erin S. Grant, Kevin J. Rietwyk, Hiroshi Abe, Takeshi Ohshima, David A. Broadway, Jean-Philippe Tetienne, Gary Bryant, Philipp Reineck
Abstract: The nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center in diamond is emerging as a powerful tool for imaging magnetic and electric signals at the microscale and below. However, most imaging demonstrations thus far have relied on costly, millimeter-sized bulk diamond substrates, which cannot be easily scaled or integrated with other materials. Here, we report a scalable method for fabricating NV-containing dense and homogenous fluorescent nanodiamond (FND) layers through electrostatic self-assembly and demonstrate the utility of the FND layers for magnetic imaging. We investigate the effect of FND concentration in suspension, substrate immersion time, and solvent pH on the FND density on the substrate. We identify optimized self-assembly conditions that maximize the FND density while minimizing aggregation. Using FND layers on a quartz substrate, we demonstrate magnetic field and magnetic noise imaging at the microscale, based on NV optically detected magnetic resonance magnetometry and T$_1$ relaxometry, respectively. Our results provide a direction for the development of cost-effective and scalable FND layers and surface coatings. This paves the way for on-demand quantum sensing and imaging on a broad range of surfaces based on NV centers and other diamond quantum emitters.

Title: Waveguiding in two-dimensional Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators
Authors: Yujie Zhou, Changsen Li, Xiumei Wang, Xingping Zhou
Abstract: Topological phases characterized by non-Abelian charges have garnered increasing attention recently. Although Floquet (periodic-driving) higher-order topological phases have been explored at the single-particle level, the role of interactions in non-Abelian topological insulators with multiple entangled energy gaps remains incompletely understood. In this work, we extend previous research by investigating higher-order topological phases featuring non-Abelian charges through Floquet engineering. Here we construct a model for two-dimensional non-Abelian higher-order topological phases on a square lattice subjected to two-step periodic driving. We find that the corner and edge states emerge and appear in all energy gaps despite the quaternion charge being trivial. Moreover, spatially exchanging the driving generates exotic interface modes-a hallmark of non-Abelian dynamics, namely non-commutativity. Notably, the non-zero composite Chern number demonstrates the non-triviality of the Floquet non-Abelian system with. We further reveal that the configuration of these quaternion-charge edge states is entirely determined by the quadruple degenerate phase-band singularities in the time evolution. Our work provides a platform for studying higher-order topological states and non-equilibrium quantum dynamics.

Title: Microrheology with rotational Brownian motion
Authors: Yasuya Nakayama
Abstract: Passive rotational microrheology (RMR) for evaluating the dynamic modulus \(G^*\) of a suspending fluid through the rotational Brownian motion of a spherical probe particle is validated using direct numerical simulations (DNS) of Brownian motion in a viscoelastic fluid. Two methods of RMR are compared: an inertialess RMR based on the Generalized Stokes--Einstein relation for rotational diffusion (RGSER) and the full RMR based on the generalized Langevin equation for rotation, which accounts for fluid and particle inertia. Our analysis, performed using DNS of the fluctuating Oldroyd-B fluid, reveals that inertialess RMR accurately estimates \(G^*\) for \(\omega\lambda \alt 1\), but deviates significantly at high frequencies. In contrast, the full RMR improves \(G^*\) estimation accuracy up to the frequency \(\omega \approx \tau_{s}^{-1}=\eta_{s}/\rho_{f}a^{2}\), where fluid inertia becomes relevant. However, in the ballistic regime (\(t \ll \tau_{s}\)), particle inertia dominates, making accurate \(G^*\) evaluation challenging even with the full RMR. This study clarifies the applicability range of RMR. Additionally, rotational Brownian motion is turned out to be insensitive to periodic boundary conditions, which allows direct application to various mesoscale molecular simulations, including coarse-grained molecular dynamics, dissipative particle dynamics, and fluid dynamics simulations. In conclusion, rotational microrheology offers a promising approach for detailed rheological analysis in complex systems and conditions.

Title: Dynamic Vacancy Levels in CsPbCl3 Obey Equilibrium Defect Thermodynamics
Authors: Irea Mosquera-Lois, Aron Walsh
Abstract: Halide vacancies are the dominant point defects in perovskites with VCl identified as a detrimental trap for the optoelectronic performance of CsPbCl3, with applications ranging from photodetectors to solar cells. Understanding these defects under operating conditions is key since their electronic levels exhibit large thermal fluctuations that challenge the validity of static 0 K models. However, quantitative modelling of defect processes requires hybrid density functional theory with spin-orbit coupling, which is too expensive for direct molecular dynamic simulations. To address this, we train a multi-task machine learning force field to study VCl in orthorhombic CsPbCl3 at 300 K. While we observe strong oscillations in the optical transition level arising from the soft potential energy surface, neither the non-radiative capture barriers nor the thermodynamic charge transition levels are affected. Our results reveal that VCl is not responsible for the non-radiative losses previously assumed. Instead, its impact on performance arises from other mechanisms, such as limiting the open-circuit voltage and promoting ionic migration. Our findings demonstrate that, despite strong dynamical effects in halide perovskites, the conventional static formalism of defect theory remains valid for predicting thermodynamic behavior, providing a sound basis for the design of high-performance energy materials.

Title: Measurement of the attractive electrosolvation force between colloidal particles
Authors: Sida Wang, Angela Le, Rowan Walker-Gibbons, Madhavi Krishnan
Abstract: Direct measurement of the pair interaction potential between electrically like-charged particles in solution reveals a strong and long-ranged attractive force. This counterintuitive attraction has been suggested to arise from the orientation of solvent molecules at the interface between the object and the electrolyte. Measuring interactions between charged microspheres carrying a variety of surface chemistries reveals that the range of the electrosolvation attraction is substantially longer than previously held. Furthermore, the length scale governing the decay of the attractive force depends on particle properties. The observations highlight significant departures from current thinking and the need for a model of interparticle interactions that accounts for the molecular nature of the solvent, its interfacial behaviour, and spatial correlations.

Title: Phase Transitions in Multidimensional Long-Range Random Field Ising Models
Authors: Lucas Affonso, Rodrigo Bissacot, João Maia
Abstract: We extend a recent argument by Ding and Zhuang from nearest-neighbor to long-range interactions and prove the phase transition in a class of ferromagnetic random field Ising models. Our proof combines a generalization of Fröhlich-Spencer contours to the multidimensional setting, proposed by two of us, with the coarse-graining procedure introduced by Fisher, Fröhlich, and Spencer. Our result shows that the Ding-Zhuang strategy is also useful for interactions $J_{xy}=|x-y|^{- \alpha}$ when $\alpha > d$ in dimension $d\geq 3$ if we have a suitable system of contours, yielding an alternative approach that does not use the Renormalization Group Method (RGM), since Bricmont and Kupiainen suggested that the RGM should also work on this generality. We can consider i.i.d. random fields with Gaussian or Bernoulli distributions.

Title: On the Onset of Coherent Phonon Motion in Peierls-Distorted Antimony by Attosecond Transient Absorption
Authors: Lauren B. Drescher, Bethany R. de Roulet, Yoong Sheng Phang, Stephen R. Leone
Abstract: Attosecond extreme-ultraviolet (XUV) transient absorption spectroscopy measurements on the Peierls-distorted phase of the semimetal antimony (Sb) are presented. After excitation by an ultrashort, broad band near-infrared (NIR) pulse, the distortion is (partly) lifted causing the well-known coherent phonon motion of the lattice. While the overall observed dynamics generally follow a displacive excitation model, a delayed onset of the pump-induced carrier dynamics due to hot-carrier thermalization is observed, as well as a large spectral phase dependence in the coherent phonon oscillation. This is attributed to significantly different carrier relaxation timescales for carrier energies above and near the Fermi level of the semimetal and corroborated by a simple theoretical model that considers the carrier relaxation timescales in the displacive phonon model to explain the observed dynamics. Our results provide direct experimental evidence about the role of carrier-relaxation in the origin of displacive coherent phonon motion.

Title: Cohomotopy, Framed Links, and Abelian Anyons
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: We establish a natural identification of cobordism classes of framed links with the fundamental group of the group-completed configuration space of points in the plane, by appeal to Okuyama's previously underappreciated interval configuration model for the latter. Under Segal's theorem, these classes are integers generated by the Hopf generator in the 2-cohomotopy of the 3-sphere, and we identify these knot-theoretically with the writhe sum of the linking and framing number of links. We observe that this link invariant is the properly regularized Wilson line observable of abelian Chern-Simons theory, and show, in consequence of the main theorem, that this arises equivalently as the expectation value of pure quantum states on the group algebra, under link sum, of cobordism classes of framed links. Observing that these quantum states regard framed links as worldlines of anyons in that they assign a fixed complex phase factor to each crossing (braiding) of strands, we close with an outlook on implications for the identification of anyonic solitons in 2D electron gases as exotic flux quantized in Cohomotopy instead of in ordinary cohomology.

Title: Constructing the Infrared Conformal Generators on the Fuzzy Sphere
Authors: Giulia Fardelli, A. Liam Fitzpatrick, Emanuel Katz
Abstract: We investigate the conformal algebra on the fuzzy sphere, and in particular the generators of translations and special conformal transformations which are emergent symmetries in the infinite IR but are broken along the RG flow. We show how to extract these generators using the energy momentum tensor, which is complicated by the fact that one does not have a priori access to the energy momentum tensor of the CFT limit but rather must construct it numerically. We discuss and quantitatively analyze the main sources of corrections to the conformal generators due to the breaking of scale-invariance at finite energy, and develop efficient methods for removing these corrections. The resulting generators have matrix elements that match CFT predictions with accuracy varying from sub-percent level for the lowest-lying states up to several percent accuracy for states with dimension $\sim 5$ with $N=16$ fermions. We show that the generators can be used to accurately identify primary operators vs descendant operators in energy ranges where the spectrum is too dense to do the identification solely based on the approximate integer spacing within conformal multiplets.

Title: Discontinuous phase transition of feature detection in lateral predictive coding
Authors: Zhen-Ye Huang, Weikang Wang, Hai-Jun Zhou
Abstract: The brain may adopt the strategy of lateral predictive coding (LPC) to construct optimal internal representations for salient features in input sensory signals, reducing the energetic cost of information transmission. Here we first consider the task of detecting one non-Gaussian signal by LPC from Gaussian background signals of the same magnitude, which is intractable by principal component decomposition. We study the emergence of feature detection function from the perspective of tradeoff between energetic cost $E$ and information robustness, and implement this tradeoff by a thermodynamic free energy. We define $E$ as the mean $L_1$-norm of the internal state vectors, and quantify the level of information robustness by an entropy measure $S$. There are at least three types of optimal LPC matrices, one type with very weak synaptic weights and $S \approx 0$, and two functional types either with low energy $E$ or with high entropy $S$ in which one single unit selectively responds to the non-Gaussian input feature. Energy--information tradeoff induce two discontinuous phase transitions between these three types of optimal LPC networks. We then extend the discussion to detecting and distinguishing between two non-Gaussian input features and observe similar discontinuous phase transitions.

Title: Quantum natural gradient with thermal-state initialization
Authors: Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: Parameterized quantum circuits (PQCs) are central to variational quantum algorithms (VQAs), yet their performance is hindered by complex loss landscapes that make their trainability challenging. Quantum natural gradient descent, which leverages the geometry of the parameterized space through quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix, offers a promising solution but has been largely limited to pure-state scenarios, with only approximate methods available for mixed-state settings. This paper addresses this question, originally posed in [Stokes et al., Quantum 4, 269 (2020)], by providing exact methods to compute three quantum generalizations of the Fisher information matrix-the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrices-for PQCs initialized with thermal states. We prove that these matrix elements can be estimated using quantum algorithms combining the Hadamard test, classical random sampling, and Hamiltonian simulation. By broadening the set of quantum generalizations of Fisher information and realizing their unbiased estimation, our results enable the implementation of quantum natural gradient descent algorithms for mixed-state PQCs, thereby enhancing the flexibility of optimization when using VQAs. Another immediate consequence of our findings is to establish fundamental limitations on the ability to estimate the parameters of a state generated by an unknown PQC, when given sample access to such a state.

Title: Wavefunction optimization at the complete basis set limit with Multiwavelets and DMRG
Authors: Martina Nibbi, Luca Frediani, Evgueni Dinvay, Christian B. Mendl
Abstract: The density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) is a powerful numerical technique to solve strongly correlated quantum systems: it deals well with systems which are not dominated by a single configuration (unlike Coupled Cluster) and it converges rapidly to the Full Configuration Interaction (FCI) limit (unlike truncated Configuration Interaction (CI) expansions). In this work, we develop an algorithm integrating DMRG within the multiwavelet-based multiresolution analysis (MRA). Unlike fixed basis sets, multiwavelets offer an adaptive and hierarchical representation of functions, approaching the complete basis set limit to a specified precision. As a result, this combined technique leverages the multireference capability of DMRG and the complete basis set limit of MRA and multiwavelets. More specifically, we adopt a pre-existing Lagrangian optimization algorithm for orbitals represented in the MRA domain and improve its computational efficiency by replacing the original CI calculations with DMRG. Additionally, we substitute the reduced density matrices computation with the direct extraction of energy gradients from the DMRG tensors. We apply our method to small systems such H2, He, HeH2, BeH2 and N2. The results demonstrate that our approach reduces the final energy while keeping the number of orbitals low compared to FCI calculations on an atomic orbital basis set.

Title: A theory of ecological invasions and its implications for eco-evolutionary dynamics
Authors: Zhijie Feng, Emmy Blumenthal, Pankaj Mehta, Akshit Goyal
Abstract: Predicting the outcomes of species invasions is a central goal of ecology, a task made especially challenging due to ecological feedbacks. To address this, we develop a general theory of ecological invasions applicable to a wide variety of ecological models: including Lotka-Volterra models, consumer resource models, and models with cross feeding. Importantly, our framework remains valid even when invading evolved (non-random) communities and accounts for invasion-driven species extinctions. We derive analytical expressions relating invasion fitness to invader abundance, shifts in the community, and extinction probabilities. These results can be understood through a new quantity we term ``dressed invasion fitness'', which augments the traditional notion of invasion fitness by incorporating ecological feedbacks. We apply our theory to analyze short-term evolutionary dynamics through a series of invasions by mutants whose traits are correlated with an existing parent. We demonstrate that, generically, mutants and parents can coexist, often by driving the extinction of low-abundance species. We validate theoretical predictions against experimental datasets spanning ecosystems from plants to microbial protists. Our work highlights the central role of ecological feedbacks in shaping community responses to invasions and mutations, suggesting that parent-mutant coexistence is widespread in eco-evolutionary dynamics.

Title: Large $N$ Wess-Zumino model at finite temperature and large chemical potential in $3d$
Authors: Srijan Kumar
Abstract: We consider the supersymmetric Wess-Zumino model at large $N$ in $(2+1)$ dimension. We introduce a chemical potential($\mu$) at finite temperature($T$). The non-trivial fixed point of this model is described by a pair of coupled gap equations. This fixed point behaves as a thermal CFT for all values of the coupling. We find that at large chemical potential these coupled equations simplify and solutions become analytically tractable. We solve them analytically for all values of the coupling at this limit. The solutions admit a systematic series expansion in $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Thus, using the solutions of the gap equation at large chemical potential we can evaluate the analytic form of the partition function, stress tensor and spin-1 current as a perturbative expansion in orders of $\frac{T}{\mu}$. Applying the OPE inversion formula on the scalar and fermion two point functions of the theory, we compute higher spin currents at large $\mu$.

Title: Determining Spin-Dependent Light Dark Matter Rates from Neutron Scattering
Authors: Asher Berlin, Alexander J. Millar, Tanner Trickle, Kevin Zhou
Abstract: The scattering and absorption rates of light dark matter with electron spin-dependent interactions depend on the target's spin response. We show how this response is encoded by the target's dynamical magnetic susceptibility, which can be measured using neutron scattering. We directly use existing neutron scattering data to compute the dark matter scattering rate in a candidate target material, finding close agreement with the previous first-principles calculation at MeV dark matter masses. Complementary experiments and measurements can extend the reach of this technique to other dark matter models and masses, and identify promising target materials for future experiments.

Title: Uhlmann and scalar Wilczek-Zee phases of degenerate quantum systems
Authors: Xin Wang, Hao Guo, Chih-Chun Chien
Abstract: The Wilczek-Zee (WZ) holonomy arises in degenerate states while the Uhlmann holonomy characterizes finite-temperature topology. We investigate possible relationships between the Uhlmann phase and the scalar WZ phase, which reflects the Uhlmann and WZ holonomy respectively, in an exemplary four-level model with two doubly degenerate subspaces. Through exact solutions, we contrast the behavior of the Uhlmann and WZ connections and their associated phases. In the zero-temperature limit, the Uhlmann phase may or may not agree with the scalar WZ phase of the degenerate ground states due to obstructions from the Hamiltonian manifested as Dirac points. This is in stark contrast to non-degenerate systems where the correspondence between the Uhlmann and Berry phases in general holds. Our analyses further show that for the example studied here, the Uhlmann phase catches the singular behavior at the Dirac points while the WZ connection and scalar WZ phase vanish along a zero-field axis. We also briefly discuss possible experimental implications.

Title: Dynamics of Vortex Clusters on a Torus
Authors: Aswathy K R, Udaya Maurya, Surya Teja Gavva, Rickmoy Samanta
Abstract: We investigate the collective dynamics of multivortex assemblies in a two dimensional (2D) toroidal fluid film of distinct curvature and topology. The incompressible and inviscid nature of the fluid allows a Hamiltonian description of the vortices, along with a self-force of geometric origin, arising from the standard Kirchhoff-Routh regularization procedure. The Hamiltonian dynamics is constructed in terms of $q$-digamma functions $\Psi_q(z)$, closely related to the Schottky-Klein prime function known to arise in multiply connected domains. We show the fundamental motion of the two-vortex system and identify five classes of geodesics on the torus for the special case of a vortex dipole, along with subtle distinctions from vortices in quantum superfluids. In multivortex assemblies, we observe that a randomly initialized cluster of vortices of the same sign and strength (chiral cluster) remains geometrically confined on the torus, while undergoing an overall drift along the toroidal direction, exhibiting collective dynamics. A cluster of fast and slow vortices also show the collective toroidal drift, with the fast ones predominantly occupying the core region and the slow ones expelled to the periphery of the revolving cluster. Vortex clusters of mixed sign but zero net circulation (achiral cluster) show unconfined dynamics and scatter all over the surface of the torus. A chiral cluster with an impurity in the form of a single vortex of opposite sign also show similar behavior as a pure chiral cluster, with occasional ``jets" of dipoles leaving and re-entering the revolving cluster. The work serves as a step towards analysis of vortex clusters in models that incorporate harmonic velocities in the Hodge decomposition.

Title: Interfacial Entanglement-Induced Time-Dependent Solidification of Polymeric Fluids
Authors: Jaewon Shim (Seoul National University), Manhee Lee (Chungbuk National University), Wonho Jhe (Seoul National University)
Abstract: The structure of polymers at solid interfaces evolves over time, but the corresponding changes in their rheological properties remain poorly understood. Here, using a home-built quartz tuning fork atomic force microscope-based nano-rheometer, we directly measure the time-dependent viscoelasticity of the interfacial fluid. The bottommost layer, closest to the substrate, undergoes solidification over 10 hours, exhibiting an approximately five-fold increase in storage modulus and a two-fold increase in loss modulus. This arises from interfacial entanglement due to the strong binding of polymers to the solid surface driven by solid-wall attractive interactions. In contrast, within the second and third layers, the storage modulus remains nearly constant over time, while the loss modulus shows approximately two-fold increase. In this region, unlike the strongly bound first layer, entropic repulsion dominates, allowing the material to behave fluid-like while becoming increasingly viscous. Notably, as the first layer, where interfacial entanglement occurs, undergoes solidification, the flow boundary for interfacial fluid flow shifts upward away from the substrate, resulting in a negative slip length. This highlights the critical role of nanoscale interfacial structure and properties in governing macroscopic flow behavior.

Title: Electron-Transfer and Exchange-Interaction Model of the Ligand Hyperfine Structure of Alkylated Iron-Sulfur Clusters
Authors: William C. Robinson, Victoria Pascutti, David A. Hall, Martín A. Mosquera
Abstract: Iron-sulfur clusters conduct a wide variety of biochemical reactions that are conserved across all domains of life. The hyperfine structure of reactive ligands of these clusters can be studied experimentally and theoretically by means of hyperfine spectroscopy, which can reveal catalytic intermediates in these biochemical processes. Their theoretical prediction, however, requires either advanced methods that describe strongly correlated systems, or Hamiltonian modeling based on symmetry-broken electronic structure methods. This work shows that the addition of electron-transfer interactions to the Heisenberg-Dirac-van Vleck Hamiltonian model leads to the quantitative explanation of hyperfine coupling constants at active organic ligand sites. Comparison with experimentally available results confirms our extended approach can be used in calculations aimed at describing cutting-edge systems.

Title: Measurement-Based Quantum Diffusion Models
Authors: Xinyu Liu, Jingze Zhuang, Wanda Hou, Yi-Zhuang You
Abstract: We introduce measurement-based quantum diffusion models that bridge classical and quantum diffusion theory through randomized weak measurements. The measurement-based approach naturally generates stochastic quantum trajectories while preserving purity at the trajectory level and inducing depolarization at the ensemble level. We address two quantum state generation problems: trajectory-level recovery of pure state ensembles and ensemble-average recovery of mixed states. For trajectory-level recovery, we establish that quantum score matching is mathematically equivalent to learning unitary generators for the reverse process. For ensemble-average recovery, we introduce local Petz recovery maps for states with finite correlation length and classical shadow reconstruction for general states, both with rigorous error bounds. Our framework establishes Petz recovery maps as quantum generalizations of reverse Fokker-Planck equations, providing a rigorous bridge between quantum recovery channels and classical stochastic reversals. This work enables new approaches to quantum state generation with potential applications in quantum information science.
