Title: Strong ergodicity breaking in dynamical mean-field equations for mixed p-spin glasses
Authors: Vincenzo Citro, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: The analytical solution to the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of mean-field spin glasses has profoundly shaped our understanding of glassy dynamics, which take place in many diverse physical systems. In particular, the idea that during the aging dynamics, the evolution becomes slower and slower, but keeps wandering in an unbounded space (a manifold of marginal states), thus forgetting any previously found configuration, has been one of the key hypotheses to achieve an analytical solution. This hypothesis, called weak ergodicity breaking, has recently been questioned by numerical simulations and attempts to solve the dynamical mean-field equations (DMFE). In this work, we introduce a new integration scheme for solving DMFE that allows us to reach very large integration times, $t=O(10^6)$, in the solution of the spherical (3+4)-spin model, quenched from close to the mode coupling temperature down to zero temperature. Thanks to this new solution, we can provide solid evidence for strong ergodicity breaking in the out-of-equilibrium dynamics on mixed p-spin glass models. Our solution to the DMFE shows that the out-of-equilibrium dynamics undergo aging, but in a restricted space: the initial condition is never forgotten, and the dynamics takes place closer and closer to configurations reached at later times. During this new restricted aging dynamics, the fluctuation-dissipation relation is richer than expected.

Title: Fermi surface and magnetic breakdown in PdGa
Authors: Nico Huber, Ivan Volkau, Alexander Engelhardt, Ilya Sheikin, Andreas Bauer, Christian Pfleiderer, Marc A. Wilde
Abstract: We study the electronic structure of the chiral semimetal PdGa by means of the de Haas-van Alphen and Shubnikov-de Haas effect. We find that the Fermi surface of PdGa comprises multiple pockets split by spin-orbit coupling. We compare our experimental findings with the band structure calculated ab initio. We demonstrate that the quantum oscillation spectra can be fully understood by considering nodal plane degeneracies at the Brillouin zone boundary and magnetic breakdown between individual Fermi surface pockets. Expanding traditional analysis methods, we explicitly calculate magnetic breakdown frequencies and cyclotron masses while taking into account that extremal breakdown trajectories may reside away from the planes of the single-band orbits. We further analyze high-frequency contributions arising from breakdown trajectories involving multiple revolutions around the Fermi surface which are distinct from conventional harmonic frequencies. Our results highlight the existence of gaps induced by spin-orbit coupling throughout the band structure of PdGa, the relevance of nodal planes on the Brillouin zone boundary, and the necessity for a comprehensive analysis of magnetic breakdown.

Title: Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes
Authors: Malte Pütz, Samuel J. Garratt, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a sharp learning transition for the two-dimensional classical Ising model, all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our results can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.

Title: Chiral crossroads in $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$: a tale of frustration in maple leaf lattice
Authors: Pratyay Ghosh
Abstract: Motivated by the recent observation of a uniform vector chirality (UVC) magnetic order in the maple-leaf lattice (MLL) realization $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ via powder neutron scattering experiments, we investigate the classical antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on the maple-leaf lattice. The MLL features three symmetry-inequivalent nearest-neighbor couplings, $J_d$, $J_t$, and $J_h$. Previous studies, primarily focused on the case where $J_t = J_h$, identified a staggered vector chirality (SVC) order. Extending beyond this limit, we demonstrate that the SVC order remains stable across a broad parameter regime. However, we also find that the UVC order cannot emerge from the nearest-neighbor model alone. By introducing a further-neighbor antiferromagnetic interaction, $J_x$, we demonstrate that even a weak $J_x$ can cause a first-order phase transition from SVC to UVC order. Using linear spin wave theory, we compute the dynamical spin structure factor, revealing distinct signatures for SVC and UVC orders that can be probed through inelastic neutron scattering experiments. Additionally, we calculate the specific heat, which exhibits qualitative agreement with the experimental data for $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$. Our findings provide a minimal framework for understanding $\mathrm{Ho_3ScO_6}$ and related MLL systems, like $\mathrm{MgMn_3O_7.3H_2O}$, suggesting avenues for further experimental and theoretical investigations.

Title: Probing viscous regimes of spin transport with local magnetometry
Authors: Jun Ho Son
Abstract: It is now well-established, both theoretically and experimentally, that charge transport of metals can be in a hydrodynamic regime in which frequent electron-electron collisions play a significant role. Meanwhile, recent experiments have demonstrated that it is possible to inject spin currents into magnetic insulator films and explore the DC transport properties of spins. Inspired by these developments, we investigate the effect of viscosity, which naturally arises in the hydrodynamic regime, on DC spin transport. We show that viscosity gives rise to a sharp peak in the spatial profile of the out-of-plane stray magnetic field near the spin current injector. We propose that local magnetometers such as SQUIDs and nitrogen-vacancy centers can detect this viscosity-induced structure in the stray magnetic field. We also discuss the relevance of our results to yittrium iron garnet, a ferromagnetic insulator, and to Kagome spin liquids.

Title: Spontaneous symmetry breaking in the Heisenberg antiferromagnet on a triangular lattice
Authors: Bastián Pradenas, Grigor Adamyan, Oleg Tchernyshyov
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of an overlooked symmetry structure in non-collinear antiferromagnets that gives rise to an emergent quantum number for magnons. Focusing on the triangular-lattice Heisenberg antiferromagnet, we show that its spin order parameter transforms under an enlarged symmetry group, $\mathrm{SO(3)_L \times SO(3)_R}$, rather than the conventional spin-rotation group $\mathrm{SO(3)}$. Although this larger symmetry is spontaneously broken by the ground state, a residual subgroup survives, leading to conserved Noether charges that, upon quantization, endow magnons with an additional quantum number -- \emph{isospin} -- beyond their energy and momentum. Our results provide a comprehensive framework for understanding symmetry, degeneracy, and quantum numbers in non-collinear magnetic systems, and bridge an unexpected connection between the paradigms of symmetry breaking in non-collinear antiferromagnets and chiral symmetry breaking in particle physics.

Title: Symmetry Aspects of Chiral Superconductors
Authors: Aline Ramires
Abstract: Recent developments in theory, synthesis, and experimental probes of quantum systems have revealed many suitable candidate materials to host chiral superconductivity. Chiral superconductors are a subset of unconventional superconductors which break time-reversal symmetry. Time-reversal symmetry breaking is possible given the order parameter's two-component nature, allowing for a complex relative phase. In this article, we focus on discussing the underlying symmetry aspects that allow for the development of chiral superconductivity. We provide an introductory account of key concepts in group theory and apply these to the classification of order parameters and the generalization of the Landau theory of phase transitions in the context of superconductivity.

Title: Anomalous Electrical Transport in the Kagome Magnet YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$

Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) kagome metals offer a unique platform for exploring electron correlation phenomena derived from quantum many-body effects. Here, we report a combined study of electrical magnetotransport and neutron scattering on YbFe$_6$Ge$_6$, where the Fe moments in the 2D kagome layers exhibit an $A$-type collinear antiferromagnetic order below $T_{\rm{N}} \approx 500$ K. Interactions between the Fe ions in the layers and the localized Yb magnetic ions in between reorient the $c$-axis aligned Fe moments to the kagome plane below $T_{\rm{SR}} \approx 63$ K. Our magnetotransport measurements show an intriguing anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that emerges in the spin-reorientated collinear state, accompanied by the closing of the spin anisotropy gap as revealed from inelastic neutron scattering. The gapless spin excitations and the Yb-Fe interaction are able to support a dynamic scalar spin chirality, which explains the observed AHE. Therefore, our study demonstrates spin fluctuations may provide an additional scattering channel for the conduction electrons and give rise to AHE even in a collinear antiferromagnet.

Title: Valley Splitting Correlations Across a Silicon Quantum Well

Abstract: Quantum dots in SiGe/Si/SiGe heterostructures host coherent electron spin qubits, which are promising for future quantum computers. The silicon quantum well hosts near-degenerate electron valley states, creating a low-lying excited state that is known to reduce spin qubit readout and control fidelity. The valley energy splitting is dominated by the microscopic disorder in the SiGe alloy and at the Si/SiGe interfaces, and while Si devices are compatible with large-scale semiconductor manufacturing, achieving a uniformly large valley splitting energy across a many-qubit device spanning mesoscopic distances is an outstanding challenge. In this work we study valley splitting variations in a 1D quantum dot array manufactured by Intel. We observe correlations in valley splitting, at both sub-100nm (single gate) and >1{\mu}m (device) lengthscales, that are consistent with alloy disorder-dominated theory and simulation. Our results develop the mesoscopic understanding of Si/SiGe heterostructures necessary for scalable device design.

Title: Coarsening of binary Bose superfluids: an effective theory
Authors: Elisabeth Gliott, Clara Piekarski, Nicolas Cherroret
Abstract: We derive an effective equation of motion for binary Bose mixtures, which generalizes the Cahn-Hilliard description of classical binary fluids to superfluid systems. Within this approach, based on a microscopic Hamiltonian formulation, we show that the domain growth law $L(t)\sim t^{2/3}$ observed in superfluid mixtures is not driven by hydrodynamic flows, but arises from the competition between interactions and quantum pressure. The effective theory allows us to derive key properties of superfluid coarsening, including domain growth and Porod's laws. This provides a new theoretical framework for understanding phase separation in superfluid mixtures.

Title: Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)
Authors: Ali Bagci, Philip E Hoggan
Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{ö}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.

Title: An Absorption Correction for Reliable Pair-Distribution Functions from Low Energy X-ray Sources
Authors: Yucong Chen, Till Schertenleib, Andrew Yang, Pascal Schouwink, Wendy L. Queen, Simon J.L. Billinge
Abstract: This paper explores the development and testing of a simple absorption correction model for processing x-ray powder diffraction data from Debye-Scherrer geometry laboratory x-ray experiments. This may be used as a pre-processing step before using PDFgetX3 to obtain reliable pair distribution functions (PDFs). The correction was found to depend only on muD, the product of the x-ray attenuation coefficient and capillary diameter. Various experimental and theoretical methods for estimating muD were explored, and the most appropriate muD values for correction were identified for different capillary diameters and x-ray beam sizes. We identify operational ranges of muD where reasonable signal to noise is possible after correction. A user-friendly software package, this http URL, is presented that can help estimate muD and perform absorption corrections, with a rapid calculation for efficient processing.

Title: Surface charge density wave in UTe2

Abstract: The spatially uniform electronic density characteristic of a metal can become unstable at low temperatures, leading to the formation of charge density waves (CDWs). These CDWs, observed in dichalcogenides, cuprates, and pnictides arise from features in the electron and lattice bandstructures that facilitate charge ordering. CDWs are often considered to compete with Kondo screening and are relatively rare in heavy fermion metals. However, the heavy fermion topological superconductor candidate UTe2 presents a notable exception, exhibiting a CDW whose origin remains elusive. Here we report high resolution Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM) experiments that reveal the primitive wavevectors of the CDW in UTe2. This allows for a refined identification of the electronic bandstructure regions susceptible to nesting. We demonstrate that the CDW wavevectors are not linked to bulk antiferromagnetic fluctuations that have been connected to other nesting features, indicating a decoupling from the bulk. We propose that surface-induced modifications of the U-5f electronic structure result in an enhancement of electronic interactions specifically at the nesting wavevectors identified here, thereby driving the formation of the observed surface CDW.

Title: Magnetoresistance in ZrSi$X$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) nodal-line semimetals
Authors: ShengNan Zhang, Oleg V. Yazyev
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles study of the magnetoresistance in ZrSi$X$ ($X=$ S, Se, Te) topological nodal-line semimetals. Our study demonstrates that all primary features of the experimentally measured magnetoresistance in these materials are captured by our calculations, including the unusual butterfly-shaped anisotropic magnetoresistance. This anisotropic magnetoresistance can be accurately reproduced using the semiclassical Boltzmann transport theory without introducing any information on the topological nature of bands or the concepts of topological phase transition. Considering the complex structure of the Fermi surface in these topological materials, we develop a theoretical description explaining the features observed in magnetoresistance measurements. Additionally, the atypical Hall resistance can be interpreted by the same semiclassical approach. Our findings establish magnetotransport as a powerful tool for analyzing the geometry of the Fermi surface, complementing angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation measurements. This approach is demonstrated to be particularly useful for determining the role of non-trivial topology in transport properties.

Title: Generalized Neumann's Principle as a Unified Framework for Fractional Quantum and Conventional Ferroelectricity
Authors: Hongsheng Pang, Lixin He
Abstract: Monolayer In$_2$Se$3$ exhibits unexpected in-plane polarization, despite having $C_{3v}$ symmetry, a feature that was traditionally considered forbidden by symmetry. To explain this remarkable behavior, Ji et al. proposed the concept of fractional quantum ferroelectricity (FQFE), in which polarization occurs in fractional multiples of a quantum, and argued that this phenomenon violates Neumann's principle. However, we introduce a generalized form of Neumann's principle and demonstrate that both FQFE and conventional ferroelectricity can be consistently described within this unified theoretical this http URL propose a method, based on the generalized Neumann's principle, for the systematic identification of FQFE materials. This approach is not only more straightforward to apply but also offers a clearer conceptual understanding and deeper physical insight compared to previous methods. Using this method, we determine all symmetry-allowed FQFE cases across the 32 crystallographic point this http URL practical applications rely on the ability to control polarization, we further show that FQFE can be effectively switched via coupling with conventional polarization. Using HfZnN$_2$ as an illustrative example, we reveal the underlying mechanism of this coupling and outline a strategy to identify other materials with similar switching behavior.

Title: Observation of the Axion quasiparticle in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$

Abstract: In 1978, Wilczek and Weinberg theoretically discovered a new boson-the Axion-which is the coherent oscillation of the $\theta$ field in QCD. Its existence can solve multiple fundamental questions including the strong CP problem of QCD and the dark matter. However, its detection is challenging because it has almost no interaction with existing particles. Similar $\theta$ has been introduced to condensed matter and so far studied as a static, quantized value to characterize topology of materials. But the coherent oscillation of $\theta$ in condensed matter is proposed to lead to new physics directly analogous to the high-energy Axion particle, the dynamical Axion quasiparticle (DAQ). In this paper, we present the direct observation of the DAQ. By combining 2D electronic device with ultrafast pump-probe optics, we manage to measure the magnetoelectric coupling $\theta$ ($\theta\propto\alpha$) of 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$ with sub-picosecond time-resolution. This allows us to directly observe the DAQ by seeing a coherent oscillation of $\theta$ at ~44 GHz in real time, which is uniquely induced by the out-of-phase antiferromagnetic magnon. Interestingly, in 2D MnBi$_2$Te$_4$, the DAQ arises from the magnon-induced coherent modulation of Berry curvature. Such ultrafast control of quantum wavefunction can be generalized to manipulate Berry curvature and quantum metric of other materials in ultrafast time-scale. Moreover, the DAQ enables novel quantum physics such as Axion polariton and electric control of ultrafast spin polarization, implying applications in unconventional light-matter interaction and coherent antiferromagnetic spintronics. Beyond condensed matter, the DAQ can serve as a detector of the dark matter Axion particle. We estimate the detection frequency range and sensitivity in the critically-lacking meV regime, contributing to one of the most challenging questions in fundamental physics.

Title: Coarse-Grained Force Fields via Rotational Entropy Corrections to Free Energy Landscapes of Diffusing Molecules
Authors: J. M. Hall, M. G. Guenza
Abstract: The construction of accurate interatomic potentials, and related fields of forces, from equilibrium conformational distributions of molecules is a crucial step in coarse-grained modeling. In this work we show that in order to develop accurate lab-frame force fields that preserve translational and rotational diffusion of a molecule, the observed body-fixed free energy landscape must be corrected for conformation-dependent rotational entropy to isolate the potential energy surface. We further demonstrate that even when the instantaneous effects of the correction are small, the resulting lagged correlations of the modeled force can be greatly altered and hence the correction is especially vital when parameterizing friction coefficients using modeled interatomic potentials.

Title: Reentrant phase transition in quasiperiodic photonic waveguides
Authors: Yang Chen, Ze-Zheng Li, Hua-Yu Bai, Shuai-Peng Guo, Tian-Yang Zhang, Xu-Lin Zhang, Qi-Dai Chen, Guang-Can Guo, Fang-Wen Sun, Zhen-Nan Tian, Ming Gong, Xi-Feng Ren, Hong-Bo Sun
Abstract: Anderson transition in quasiperiodic potentials and the associated mobility edges have been a central focus in quantum simulation across multidisciplinary physical platforms. While these transitions have been experimentally observed in ultracold atoms, acoustic systems, optical waveguides, and superconducting junctions, their interplay between quasiperiodic potential and long-range hopping remains unexplored experimentally. In this work, we report the observation of localization-delocalization transition induced by the hopping between the next-nearest neighboring sites using quasiperiodic photonic waveguides. Our findings demonstrate that increasing the next-nearest hopping strength induces a reentrant phase transition, where the system transitions from an initially extended phase into a localized phase before eventually returning to an extended phase. This remarkable interplay between hopping and quasiperiodic potential in the lattice models provides crucial insights into the mechanism of Anderson transition. Furthermore, our numerical simulation reveals that this phase transition exhibits a critical exponent of $\nu \simeq 1/3$, which is experimentally observable for system sizes $L\sim10^3$ - $10^4$. These results establish a framework for direct observation of the Anderson transition and precise determination of its critical exponents, which can significantly advance our understanding of localization physics in quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Boundary criticality in two-dimensional interacting topological insulators
Authors: Yang Ge, Hong Yao, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: We study the boundary criticality in 2D interacting topological insulators. Using the determinant quantum Monte Carlo method, we present the first nonperturbative study of the boundary quantum phase diagram in the Kane-Mele-Hubbard-Rashba model. Our results reveal rich boundary critical phenomena at the quantum phase transition between a topological insulator and an antiferromagnetic insulator, encompassing ordinary, special, and extraordinary transitions. Combining analytical derivation of the boundary theory with unbiased numerically-exact quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we demonstrate that the presence of topological edge states enriches the ordinary transition that renders a continuous boundary scaling dimension and, more intriguingly, leads to a special transition of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type. Our work establishes a novel framework for the nonperturbative study of boundary criticality in two-dimensional topological systems with strong electron correlations.

Title: Crystal growth, structure and physical properties of quasi-one-dimensional tellurides Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$
Authors: S. N. Sun, D. Y. Xu, C. L. Shang, B. X. Shi, J. L. Huang, X. J. Gui, Z. C. Sun, J. J. Liu, J. C. Wang, H. X. Zhang, P. Cheng
Abstract: A new ternary compound Fe$_{4-x}$VTe$_{4-y}$ ($x=1.01$, $y=0.74$) with Ti5Te4-type structure is identified. Fe and V atoms tend to occupy different crystallographic positions and form quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) Fe-V chains along the c-axis. Millimeter-sized single crystal of Fe$_{2.99}$VTe$_{3.26}$ (FVT) with slender-stick shape could be grown by chemical vapor transport method which reflects its quasi-1D crystal structure. Magnetization measurements reveal that FVT orders antiferromagnetically below T$_N$=93 K with strong easy ab-plane magnetic anisotropy. Although a weak glassy-like behavior appears below 10 K, FVT is dominant by long-range antiferromagnetic order in contrast to the spin-glass state in previously reported isostructural Fe$_{5}$Te$_{4}$. We also synthesize V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ with similar quasi-1D V-chains and find it has weak anomalies at 144 K on both resistivity and susceptibility curves. However, no clear evidence is found for the development of magnetic or charge order. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Curie-Weiss fit reveal that the effective moments for Fe$^{2+}$ and V$^{4+}$ in both compounds have large deviations from the conventional local moment model, which may possibly result from the formation of Fe/V metal-metal bondings. Furthermore the resistivity of both FVT and V$_{4.64}$Te$_4$ exhibits semiconducting-like temperature-dependent behavior but with average values close to typical bad metals, which resembles the transport behavior in the normal state of Fe-based superconductors. These quasi-1D compounds have shown interesting physical properties for future condensed matter physics research.

Title: Accelerated Collapse Kinetics of Charged Polymers in Good Solvent: Role of Counterion Condensation
Authors: Susmita Ghosh, Satyavani Vemparala
Abstract: We investigate the collapse kinetics of charged polymers (polyelectrolytes) induced by counterion condensation using coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations. Under good solvent conditions, polyelectrolytes above the critical charge density ($A > A_c$) exhibit significantly faster collapse dynamics compared to neutral polymers, with dynamic scaling exponents ($\nu_c \approx 0.76-0.84$) distinctly smaller than those observed for neutral polymers ($\nu_c \approx 1.44$) . This accelerated collapse is driven primarily by three mechanisms: (1) local charge neutralization due to counterion condensation, which facilitates immediate local compaction, (2) screening of long-range electrostatic repulsions, reducing the conformational search space, and (3) bridging interactions mediated by multivalent counterions, enhancing efficient formation of intra-chain contacts. We systematically explore the effects of polymer length, charge density, and counterion valency (monovalent, divalent, and trivalent) on collapse dynamics, demonstrating that increased counterion valency significantly lowers the critical charge density required for collapse and accelerates the collapse process. Our findings highlight the limitations of modeling charged biopolymers using purely neutral coarse-grained models, underscoring the importance of electrostatic interactions and counterion dynamics in determining their kinetic pathways. These insights may aid in better understanding the folding, organization, and dynamics of inherently charged biomolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids.

Title: Current-driven dynamics of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions
Authors: Wooyon Kim, Jun Seok Seo, Se Kwon Kim
Abstract: Domain-wall skyrmions are magnetic solitons embedded in a domain wall that are topologically equivalent to skyrmions. Here, we theoretically study antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions and their current-driven motion within the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert phenomenology, and verify our findings with micromagnetic simulations. While the skyrmion Hall effect is expected to be suppressed in the current-induced motion of antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions, we observe a finite Hall angle, which originates from the anisotropic spin configuration of domain-wall skyrmions. The skyrmion Hall effect is, however, conditionally suppressed and the motion aligns with the current applied in certain directions, which can be interpreted as principal axes of a domain-wall skyrmion that is easily identified from the symmetry of the spin configuration. Our work on antiferromagnetic domain-wall skyrmions shows that the dynamics of spin textures endowed with multiple soliton characteristics can be unconventional, which is envisaged to enrich the field of topological solitons.

Title: Optimizing low-dissipation Carnot-like thermal devices with heat leak
Authors: Zhuolin Ye, Viktor Holubec
Abstract: Delimiting the bounds of optimal performance for heat engines (HEs), refrigerators (REs), and heat pumps (HPs) is a central goal in thermodynamics. While low-dissipation (LD) models have proven valuable for this purpose, the role of heat leak in such models has received limited attention. Here, we present a unified framework for LD Carnot-like (CL) HEs, REs, and HPs that incorporates heat leaks, and derive new results for the efficiency at maximum power and the power at maximum efficiency. We further investigate the relationship between the bounds of power at fixed efficiency and efficiency at fixed power, demonstrating that these bounds coincide and are described by identical curves across all thermal devices. Finally, we show that the optimal performance of all three devices can be achieved by optimizing the average entropy production rate over the cycle, a result that holds for any CL device and extends beyond the LD assumption.

Title: Rare-Event-Induced Ergodicity Breaking in Logarithmic Aging Systems
Authors: Chunyan Li, Qingyang Feng, Tianjie Zhou, Haiwen Liu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: Ergodicity breaking and aging effects are fundamental challenges in out-of-equilibrium systems. Various mechanisms have been proposed to understand the non-ergodic and aging phenomena, possibly related to observations in systems ranging from structural glass and Anderson glasses to biological systems and mechanical systems. While anomalous diffusion described by Levy statistics efficiently captures ergodicity breaking, the origin of aging and ergodicity breaking in systems with ultraslow dynamics remain unclear. Here, we report a novel mechanism of ergodicity breaking in systems exhibiting log-aging diffusion. This mechanism, characterized by increasingly infrequent rare events with aging, yields statistics deviating significantly from Levy distribution, breaking ergodicity as shown by unequal time- and ensemble-averaged mean squared displacements and two distinct asymptotic probability distribution functions. Notably, although these rare events contribute negligibly to statistical averages, they dramatically change the system's characteristic time. This work lays the groundwork for microscopic understanding of out-of-equilibrium systems and provides new perspectives on glasses and Griffiths-McCoy singularities.

Title: Observing Nucleation and Crystallization of Rocksalt LiF from Molten State through Molecular Dynamics Simulations with Refined Machine-Learned Force Field
Authors: Boyuan Xu, Liyi Bai, Shenzhen Xu, Qisheng Wu
Abstract: Lithium fluoride (LiF) is a critical component for stabilizing lithium metal anode and high-voltage cathodes towards the next-generation high-energy-density lithium this http URL modeling study reported the formation of wurtzite LiF below about 550 K (J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2023, 145, 1327-1333), in contrast to experimental observation of rocksalt LiF under ambient conditions. To address this discrepancy, we employ molecular dynamics (MD) simulations with a refined machine-learned force field (MLFF), and demonstrate the nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF from the molten phase at temperatures below about 800 K. The rocksalt phase remains stable in LiF nanoparticles. Complementary density functional theory (DFT) calculations show that dispersion interactions are essential for correctly predicting the thermodynamic stability of rocksalt LiF over the wurtzite phase on top of the commonly used PBE functional. Furthermore, we show that inclusion of virial stresses--alongside energies and forces--in the training of MLFFs is crucial for capturing phase nucleation and crystallization of rocksalt LiF under the isothermal-isobaric ensemble. These findings underscore the critical role of dispersion interactions in atomistic simulations of battery materials, where such effects are often non-negligible, and highlight the necessity of incorporating virial stresses during the training of MLFF to enable accurate modeling of solid-state systems.

Title: High Breakdown Electric Field (> 5 MV/cm) in UWBG AlGaN Transistors
Authors: Seungheon Shin, Hridibrata Pal, Jon Pratt, John Niroula, Yinxuan Zhu, Chandan Joishi, Brianna A. Klein, Andrew Armstrong, Andrew A. Allerman, Tomás Palacios, Siddharth Rajan
Abstract: We report on the design and demonstration of ultra-wide bandgap (UWBG) AlGaN-channel metal-insulator heterostructure field effect transistors (HEFTs) for high-power, high-frequency applications. We find that the integration of gate dielectrics and field plates greatly improves the breakdown field in these devices, with state-of-art average breakdown field of 5.3 MV/cm (breakdown voltage > 260 V) with an associated maximum current density of 342 mA/mm, and cut-off frequency of 9.1 GHz. Furthermore, low trap-related impact was observed from minimal gate and drain lag estimated from pulsed I-V characteristics. The reported results provide the potential of UWBG AlGaN HEFTs for the next generation high-power radio frequency applications.

Title: Rheology of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials
Authors: Yuria Kobayashi, Shunsuke Iizuka, Satoshi Takada
Abstract: The kinetic theory of dilute granular gases with hard-core and inverse power-law potentials is developed. The scattering process is studied theoretically, which yields the relative speed and the impact parameter dependence of the scattering angle. The viscosity is derived from the Boltzmann equation and its temperature dependence is plotted. We also perform the direct simulation Monte Carlo to check the validity of the theory.

Title: Ab initio study of anisotropic effects in two-dimensional Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ using $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions
Authors: Ilya V. Kashin, Sergei N. Andreev
Abstract: In the present work, we develop the Green's function apparatus and extend its applicability to the study of microscopic anisotropic effects in real conducting materials. The problem of the previously proposed approaches written in terms of inter-atomic Green's functions is the presence of a spatial sum over all atoms of the crystal, which greatly complicates their application to systems with itinerant electrons. To provide a solution we derived expressions for magnetic torque vector and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions based on $\bf{k}$-dependent Green's functions, which allow numerical evaluations with guaranteed stability of spatial sums over the crystal lattice and moreover with much lower computational cost. Approbation of the approaches on the case of Fe$_3$GeTe$_2$ monolayer, which is based on first-principles DFT calculations, confirmed the numerical stability and allowed us to reproduce the characteristic length of experimentally observed collective spin excitations in the domain structure of this promising conducting material.

Title: 7-Methylquinolinium Iodobismuthate Memristor: Exploring Plasticity and Memristive Properties for Digit Classification in Physical Reservoir Computing
Authors: Gisya Abdi, Ahmet Karacali, Alif Syafiq Kamarol Zaman, Marlena Gryl, Andrzej Sławek, Aleksandra Szkudlarek, Hirofumi Tanaka, Konrad Szaciłowski
Abstract: This study investigates 7-methylquinolinium halobismuthates (I, Br, and Cl) in two aspects: (1) their structural and semiconducting properties influenced by anionic composition, and (2) their memristive and plasticity characteristics for neuromorphic and reservoir computing applications. Structural changes induced by halides form low-dimensional halobismuthate fragments, confirmed by crystallographic analysis. Optical band gaps were studied using diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, aligning with density functional theory results. Due to solubility limitations, only bismuth iodide complexes were explored in electronic devices. Current-voltage scans showed pinched hysteresis loops, characteristic of memristors. Conductivity versus temperature study indicates combined ionic and electronic contributions to conductivity of the devices. Given that a memristor can function as a single synapse without the need for programming, aligning with the requirements of neuromorphic computing, the study investigated long-term depression, potentiation, and spike-time-dependent plasticity. As the potentiation-depression plots showed non-linearity with fading memory, these materials can be a good candidate for application in physical reservoir computing. To further assess this material, an electronic device with sixteen gold electrodes was applied, featuring one input and 15 output electrodes deposited on silicon substrate and covered with a layer of studied compound. Basic test to assess the complexity and non-linearity of the devices were conducted through a series of benchmark tasks, including waveform generation, NARMA-2, memory capacity assessment, and noise study under both DC and AC current. The ability of device in MNIST digit classification with 82.26% accuracy and voice classification for digit 2 for six different people with 82 % accuracy has been demonstrated.

Title: Ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core-excitons in graphite: a femtosecond RIXS perspective
Authors: Marco Malvestuto, Beatrice Volpato, Elena Babici, Richa Bhardwaj, Antonio Caretta, Simone Laterza, Fulvio Parmigiani, Michele Manfredda, Alberto Simoncig, Marco Zangrando, Alexander Demidovich, Peter Susnjar, Enrico Massimiliano Allaria, Alexander Darius Brynes, David Garzella, Luca Giannessi, Primoz Rebernik, Filippo Sottocorona, Dino Novko
Abstract: This study demonstrates one of the first implementations of time-resolved resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (tr-RIXS), marking a seminal extension of RIXS spectroscopy into the ultrafast time domain. By investigating the ultrafast dynamics of vibronically dressed core excitons in graphite using femtosecond X-ray pulses from a Free Electron Laser, we reveal previously inaccessible insights into the transient coupling between core excitons and specific optical phonon modes. Our approach establishes tr-RIXS as a powerful, transformative tool capable of elucidating the intricate interplay between electronic and lattice dynamics, opening new avenues in ultrafast materials research.

Title: Nonlinear spin dynamics across Néel phase transition in ferromagnetic/antiferromagnetic multilayers
Authors: O. Busel, D. Polishchuk, A. Kravets, V. Korenivski
Abstract: We observe strongly nonlinear spin dynamics in ferro-/antiferro-magnetic multilayers, controlled by the number of bilayers in the system, layer thicknesses, as well as temperature, peaking in magnitude near the Néel point of the antiferromagnetic layers just above room temperature. Well above the Néel transition, the individual ferromagnetic layers are exchange decoupled and resonate independently. As the temperature is lowered toward the Néel point, the ferromagnetic proximity effect through the thin antiferromagnetic spacers transforms the system into a weakly coupled macrospin chain along the film normal, which exhibits pronounced standing spin-wave resonance modes, comparable in intensity to the uniform resonance in the ferromagnetic layers. These findings are supported by our micromagnetic simulations showing clear spin-wave profiles with precessional phase lag along the macrospin chain. Well below the Néel transition, the FeMn layers order strongly antiferromagnetically and exchange-pin the ferromagnetic layers to effectively make the multilayer one macrospin. The appearance and intensity of the high-frequency spin-wave modes can thus be conveniently controlled by thermal gating the multilayer. The nonlinearity in the microwave response of the demonstrated material can approach 100\%, large compared to nonlinear materials used in e.g. optics, with second-harmonic generation often at the single percentage level.

Title: Model calculations of the strains associated with surface acoustic waves
Authors: Takuya Kawada, Masashi Kawaguchi, Hiroki Matsumoto, Masamitsu Hayashi
Abstract: Magnon-phonon coupling has garnered increasing interest in condensed matter physics due to its fertile physics and potential applications in devices with novel functionalities. Surface acoustic waves (SAWs) are commonly employed as a source of coherent acoustic phonons. The strain associated with SAWs couples to magnetization of magnetic materials via magnetoelastic coupling and/or spin-rotation coupling. A typical SAW device is formed on a piezoelectric substrate with anisotropic crystal structure. Since the form of strain depends on the material parameters and structure of the SAW device, it is of vital importance to understand its character. In this paper, we present a comprehensive methodology to numerically calculate the SAW velocity, SAW excitation efficiency, lattice displacement and all strain components associated with SAW. LiNbO$_3$ is used as a prototypical material system. All quantities depend on the SAW propagation direction with respect to the crystalline axis and on the electrical boundary conditions. In contrast to non-piezoelectric isotropic media, we find that all shear strain components can be induced in LiNbO$_3$, with their amplitude and relative phase (with respect to the longitudinal strain) dependent on the propagation direction and the boundary conditions at the LiNbO$_3$ surface. These results offer a robust foundation for analyzing strain-driven magnon-phonon coupling mechanisms and contribute to designing strain-engineered functional magnonic and phononic devices.

Title: Self-consistent random phase approximation and optimized hybrid functionals for solids
Authors: Thomas Pitts, Damian Contant, Maria Hellgren
Abstract: The random phase approximation (RPA) and the $GW$ approximation share the same total energy functional but RPA is defined on a restricted domain of Green's functions determined by a local Kohn-Sham (KS) potential. In this work, we perform self-consistent RPA calculations by optimizing the local KS potential through the optimized effective potential equation. We study a number of solids (C, Si, BN, LiF, MgO, TiO$_2$), and find in all cases a lowering of the total energy with respect to non-self-consistent RPA. We then propose a variational approach to optimize PBE0-type hybrid functionals based on the minimization of the RPA total energy with respect to the fraction of exact exchange used to generate the input KS orbitals. We show that this scheme leads to hybrid functionals with a KS band structure in close agreement with RPA, and with lattice constants of similar accuracy as within RPA. Finally, we evaluate $G_0W_0$ gaps using RPA and hybrid KS potentials as starting points. Special attention is given to TiO$_2$, which exhibits a strong starting-point dependence.

Title: Crossover in Electronic Specific Heat near Narrow-Sense Type-III Dirac Cones
Authors: Keita Kishigi, Yasumasa Hasegawa
Abstract: Two-dimensional massless Dirac fermions exhibit Dirac cones, which are classified into three types: type-I, type-II, and type-III. In both type-I and type-II cones, the energy dispersion is linear in all momentum directions. Type-I cones are characterized by a non-overtilted structure, where the Dirac point serves as a local minimum (maximum) for the upper (lower) band. In contrast, type-II cones exhibit overtilted dispersions, leading to the coexistence of electron and hole pockets. At the critical tilt, the linear energy dispersion vanishes in one momentum direction, corresponding to a type-III Dirac cone. We further define a special case, termed the "narrow-sense" type-III cone, where not only the linear term but also quadratic and higher-order terms vanish, resulting in a completely flat dispersion along one direction. In this work, we numerically investigate the temperature ($T$) -dependence of the electronic specific heat ($C$), as the Dirac cone is continuously tilted from type-I to narrow-sense type-III. A model with particle-hole symmetry is employed to ensure that the chemical potential ($\mu$) remains temperature independent. Our results reveal a notable crossover in $C$ near narrow-sense type-III, where $C$ changes from $C \propto T^{2}$ below the crossover temperature ($T_{\rm co}$) to $C \propto T^{\frac{1}{2}}$ above $T_{\rm co}$. This crossover is attributed to the energy-dependent structure of the density of states. The present findings suggest a feasible approach for experimentally probing the degree of Dirac cone tilting near the narrow-sense type-III limit.

Title: Accessing quasi-flat $\textit{f}$-bands to harvest large Berry curvature in NdGaSi
Authors: Anyesh Saraswati, Jyotirmoy Sau, Sudipta Chatterjee, Sandip Kumar Kuila, Bibhas Ghanta, Anup Kumar Bera, Partha Pratim Jana, Manoranjan Kumar, Nitesh Kumar
Abstract: Bands away from the Fermi energy do not influence the electrical conduction. In typical rare-earth lanthanide compounds, the localized 4$\textit{f}$-electrons have a weak effect on the electrical conduction, limiting their influence on the Berry curvature and, hence, the intrinsic anomalous Hall effect. However, a comprehensive study of the magnetic, thermodynamic, and transport properties of single-crystalline NdGaSi, guided by first-principles calculations, reveals a ferromagnetic ground state that induces a splitting of quasi-flat 4$\textit{f}$-electronic bands and positions them near the Fermi energy. The observation of an extraordinarily large intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of 1165 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$ implies the direct involvement of localized states in the generation of non-trivial band crossings around the Fermi energy. These results are remarkable when compared to ferrimagnetic NdAlSi, which differs only in a non-magnetic atom (a change in the principal quantum number $\textit{n}$ of the outer $\textit{p}$ orbital) with the same number of valence electrons and does not exhibit any measurable anomalous Hall conductivity.

Title: Probing the topological protection of edge states in multilayer tungsten ditelluride with the superconducting proximity effect

Abstract: The topology of WTe2, a transition metal dichalcogenide with large spin-orbit interactions, is thought to combine type II Weyl semimetal and second-order topological insulator (SOTI) character. The SOTI character should endow WTe2 multilayer crystals with topologically protected helical states at its hinges, and, indeed, 1D states have been detected thanks to Josephson interferometry. However, the immunity to backscattering conferred to those states by their helical nature has so far not been tested. To probe the topological protection of WTe2 edge states, we have fabricated Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices (SQUIDs) in which the supercurrent through a junction on the crystal edge interferes with the supercurrent through a junction in the bulk of the crystal. We find behaviors ranging from a Symmetric SQUID pattern to asymmetric SQUID patterns, including one in which the modulation by magnetic field reveals a sawtooth-like supercurrent versus phase relation for the edge junction, demonstrating that the supercurrent at the edge is carried by ballistic channels over 600 nm, a tell-tale sign of the SOTI character of WTe2.

Title: Long-wavelength optical lattices from optical beatnotes: theory and applications
Authors: Tommaso Petrucciani, Andrea Santoni, Chiara Mazzinghi, Dimitrios Trypogeorgos, Francesco Minardi, Marco Fattori, Michele Modugno
Abstract: We present a theoretical analysis of Beat-Note Superlattices (BNSLs), a recently demonstrated technique for generating periodic trapping potentials for ultracold atomic clouds, with arbitrarily large lattice spacings while maintaining interferometric stability. By combining two optical lattices with slightly different wavelengths, a beatnote intensity pattern is formed, generating, for low depths, an effective lattice potential with a periodicity equal to the wavelength associated to the difference between the wavevectors of the two lattices. We study the range of lattice depths and wavelengths under which this approximation is valid and investigate its robustness against perturbations. We present a few examples where the use of BNSLs could offer significant advantages in comparison to well established techniques for the manipulation of ultracold atomic gases. Our results highlight the potential of BNSLs for quantum simulation, atom interferometry, and other applications in quantum technologies.

Title: Scattering of a Dirac particle by a Berry phase domain wall
Authors: Lassaad Mandhour, Farah Bouhadida, Frédéric Piéchon
Abstract: Massless Dirac particles are characterized by an effective pseudospin-momentum locking, which is the origin of the peculiar scattering properties of Dirac particles through potential barriers. This pseudospin-momentum locking also governs the quantum geometric properties (such as the Berry phase and Berry curvature) of Dirac particles. In the present work, we demonstrate that a domain wall separating two regions with distinct quantum geometric properties can serve as an alternative to potential barriers. Specifically, using the three-band $\alpha-T_3$ model of two-dimensional Dirac particles, we show that a Berry phase domain wall results in partial reflection and transmission of the Dirac particles, despite the fact that the incident and refracted momenta are identical.

Title: A scaling relation of vortex-induced rectification effects in a superconducting thin-film heterostructure
Authors: Yusuke Kobayashi, Junichi Shiogai, Tsutomu Nojima, Jobu Matsuno
Abstract: Supercurrent rectification, nonreciprocal response of superconducting properties sensitive to the polarity of bias and magnetic field, has attracted growing interest as an ideal diode. While the superconducting rectification effect is a consequence of the asymmetric vortex pinning, the mechanisms to develop its asymmetric potentials have been a subject of ongoing debate, mainly focusing on microscopic breaking of spatial inversion symmetry and macroscopic imbalance of the sample structure. Here, we report on comparative study of the superconducting diode effect and nonreciprocal resistance in a superconducting Fe(Se,Te)/FeTe heterostructure. In normal state, we observe finite nonreciprocal resistance as a hallmark of the spin-orbit interaction with structural inversion asymmetry. In the superconducting state, we find that the strongly enhanced nonreciprocal coefficient in transition regime is directly coupled to the superconducting diode efficiency through a universal scaling law, indicating the role of spin-momentum-locked state on the asymmetric pinning potential. Our findings, providing a unified picture of the superconducting rectification, pave the way for functionalizing superconducting diode devices.

Title: A particle-based approach for the prediction of grain microstructures in solidification processes
Authors: Salem Mosbah, Rodrigo Gómez Vázquez, Constantin Zenz, Damien Tourret, Andreas Otto
Abstract: Grain microstructures are crucial to the mechanical properties, performance, and often lifetime of metallic components. Hence, the prediction of grain microstructures emerging from solidification processes at relevant macroscopic scale is essential to the design or optimization of new alloys and processing conditions. Yet, despite the broad range of multi-scale models proposed so far, all of them suffer from computational limitations, such that advances from computational and algorithm perspectives remain needed. Here, we present a novel approach for tracking crystallographic solidification grain envelopes capable of predicting competitive growth scenarios and columnar-to-equiaxed transitions for stationary grains. The model relies on classical assumptions and equations in use in several broadly used and thoroughly validated approaches (e.g. cellular automata). Yet, our approach defines the grain envelope using Lagrangian particles and tracks their evolution using an algorithm and an implementation relying on scalable libraries and using modern CPU/GPU architectures. The model is used to simulate several benchmarks of increasing complexity, and the results are compared to analytical, experimental, and numerical results from literature for the purpose of model validation. To highlight the applicability to real-world processes and the possibility of coupling the model with existing physics-based simulation tools, the model is also (one-way) coupled with a multiphysics laser-material-interaction model to simulate competitive grain growth during laser beam welding of steel.

Title: Frustrated kagome-lattice bilayer quantum Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Dmytro Yaremchuk, Taras Hutak, Vasyl Baliha, Taras Krokhmalskii, Oleg Derzhko, Jürgen Schnack, Johannes Richter
Abstract: We consider the $S=1/2$ antiferromagnetic Heisenberg model on a frustrated kagome-lattice bilayer with strong nearest-neighbor interlayer coupling and examine its low-temperature magnetothermodynamics using a mapping onto a rhombi gas on the kagome lattice. Besides, we use finite-size numerics to illustrate the validity of the classical lattice-gas description. Among our findings there are i) the absence of an order-disorder phase transition and ii) the sensitivity of the specific heat at low temperatures to the shape of the system just below the saturation magnetic field even in the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the cubic Kondo-lattice model
Authors: Ryo Hamano, Masahito Mochizuki
Abstract: We theoretically study photoinduced magnetic phase transitions and their dynamical processes in the Kondo-lattice model on a cubic lattice. It is demonstrated that light irradiation gives rise to magnetic phase transitions from the ground-state ferromagnetic state to a three-dimensional antiferromagnetic state as a nonequilibrium steady state in the photodriven system. This phase transition occurs as a consequence of the formation of pseudo half-filling band occupation via the photoexcitation and relaxation of electrons, where all the electron states constituting the lower band separated from the upper band by an exchange gap are partially but nearly uniformly occupied. We also find that several types of antiferromagnetic correlations, e.g., A-type and C-type antiferromagnetic correlations, appear in a transient state of the dynamical phase transition. By calculating magnon spectra for the photodriven system, we argue that the instability to the A-type or C-type antiferromagnetic state occurs in the ferromagnetic ground state as a softening of the magnon band dispersion at corresponding momentum points depending on the light polarization. Our findings provide important insights into the understanding of photoinduced magnetic phase transitions in the three-dimensional Kondo-lattice magnets.

Title: Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase
Authors: A. V. Kuzikova, N. A. Liubachko, S. N. Barilo, A. V. Sadovnikov, R. V. Pisarev, A. M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.

Title: Osmolyte-Modulated Differential Capacitance and Disjoining Pressure for Nanoconfined Electrolytes: A Modified Poisson-Boltzmann Theory
Authors: Victoria A. Vasileva, Petr E. Brandyshev, Yury A. Budkov
Abstract: This study employs modified Poisson-Boltzmann theory to systematically investigate the influence of zwitterionic osmolyte additives to an electrolyte solution on disjoining pressure and electric differential capacitance within charged slit-like nanopores with conductive walls. We demonstrate that increasing concentrations of zwitterionic osmolytes result in a marked synergistic enhancement of both disjoining pressure and differential capacitance, highlighting their dual role in improving supercapacitor performance. The insights gained underscore the unique capabilities of zwitterionic osmolytes as multifunctional additives for fine-tuning the properties of electric double layers, thereby bridging the gap between capacitive efficiency and electrode longevity.

Title: Unraveling the thermodynamics and mechanism behind the lowering of reduction temperatures in oxide mixtures
Authors: Shiv Shankar, Barak Ratzker, Alisson Kwiatkowski da Silva, Tim M. Schwarz, Hans Brouwer, Baptiste Gault, Yan Ma, Dierk Raabe
Abstract: Hydrogen-based direct reduction offers a sustainable pathway to decarbonize the metal production industry. However, stable metal oxides, like Cr$_2$O$_3$, are notoriously difficult to reduce, requiring extremely high temperatures (above 1300 $^\circ$C). Herein, we show how reducing mixed oxides can be leveraged to lower hydrogen-based reduction temperatures of stable oxides and produce alloys in a single process. Using a newly developed thermodynamic framework, we predict the precise conditions (oxygen partial pressure, temperature, and oxide composition) needed for co-reduction. We showcase this approach by reducing Cr$_2$O$_3$ mixed with Fe$_2$O$_3$ at 1100 $^\circ$C, significantly lowering reduction temperatures (by $\geq$200 $^\circ$C). Our model and post-reduction atom probe tomography analysis elucidate that the temperature-lowering effect is driven by the lower chemical activity of Cr in the metallic phase. This strategy achieves low-temperature co-reduction of mixed oxides, dramatically reducing energy consumption and CO$_2$ emissions, while unlocking transformative pathways toward sustainable alloy design.

Title: Tensor-monopole-induced topological boundary effects in four-dimensional acoustic metamaterials
Authors: Qingyang Mo, Shanjun Liang, Cuicui Lu, Jie Zhu, Shuang Zhang
Abstract: Gauge field theory provides the mathematical and conceptual framework to describe and understand topological singularities such as Weyl points and magnetic monopoles. While singularities associated with vector electromagnetic gauge fields have been well-studied, those of higher-form tensor gauge fields, like the four-dimensional (4D) tensor monopoles predicted by string theory, have remained largely theoretical or limited to experimental demonstration in pure synthetic dimensions, thereby not allowing investigations of the associated boundary effects. Here, we present a 4D system with tensor monopoles using engineered acoustic metamaterials. Our momentum space combines three real momentum dimensions and a geometric parameter as the fourth. By varying this fourth momentum, we experimentally reveal two distinct topological surface states in 3D subsystems: Fermi-arc surface states in a gapless subsystem and Dirac-cone surface states in a gapped subsystem. Our work introduces a novel platform for exploring new topological structures associated with tensor gauge field and topological phenomena in higher dimensions.

Title: X-ray linear dichroic orientation tomography: reconstruction of nanoscale three-dimensional orientation fields
Authors: Andreas Apseros, Valerio Scagnoli, Manuel Guizar-Sicairos, Laura J. Heyderman, Johannes Ihli, Claire Donnelly
Abstract: Properties in crystalline and ordered materials tend to be anisotropic, with their orientation affecting the macroscopic behavior and functionality of materials. The ability to image the orientation of anisotropic material properties in three dimensions (3D) is fundamental for the understanding and functionality-driven development of novel materials. With the development of X ray linear dichroic orientation tomography (XL DOT), it is now possible to non-destructively map three-dimensional (3D) orientation fields in micrometer-sized samples. In this work, we present the iterative, gradient-based reconstruction algorithm behind XL DOT that can be used to map orientations based on linear dichroism in 3D. As linear dichroism can be exhibited by a broad spectrum of materials, XL DOT can be used to map, for example, crystal orientations as well as ferroic alignment, such as ferroelectric and antiferromagnetic order. We demonstrate the robustness of this technique for orientation fields that exhibit smoothly varying and granular configurations, and subsequently identify and discuss optimal geometries for experimental data acquisition and optimal conditions for the reconstruction. We anticipate that this technique will be instrumental in enabling a deeper understanding of the relationship between material structures and their functionality, quantifying, for example, the orientation of charge distributions and magnetic anisotropies at the nanoscale in a wide variety of systems - from functional to energy materials.

Title: Motion of ferrodark solitons in harmonically trapped superfluids: spin corrections and emergent quartic potentials exhibiting symmetry breaking
Authors: Jiangnan Biguo, Xiaoquan Yu
Abstract: We propose a framework for topological soliton dynamics in trapped spinor superfluids, decomposing the force acting on the soliton by the surrounding fluid into the buoyancy force and spin-corrections arising from the density depletion at soliton core and the coupling between the orbital motion and the spin mixing, respectively. For ferrodark solitons (FDSs) in spin-1 Bose-Einstein Condensates (BECs), the spin correction enables mapping the FDS motion in a harmonic trap to the atomic-mass particle dynamics in an emergent quartic potential. Initially placing a type-I FDS near the trap center, a single-sided oscillation happens, which maps to the particle moving around a local minimum of the emergent double-well potential. As the initial distance of a type-II FDS from the trap center increases, the motion exhibits three regimes: trap-centered harmonic and anharmonic, followed by single-sided oscillations. Correspondingly the emergent quartic potential undergoes symmetry breaking, transitioning from a single minimum to a double-well shape, where particle motion shifts from oscillating around the single minimum to crossing between two minima via the local maximum, then the motion around one of the two minima. In a hard-wall trap with linear potential, the FDS motion maps to a harmonic oscillator.

Title: Hopf Exceptional Points
Authors: Tsuneya Yoshida, Emil J. Bergholtz, Tomáš Bzdušek
Abstract: Exceptional points at which eigenvalues and eigenvectors of non-Hermitian matrices coalesce are ubiquitous in the description of a wide range of platforms from photonic or mechanical metamaterials to open quantum systems. Here, we introduce a class of Hopf exceptional points (HEPs) that are protected by the Hopf invariants (including the higher-dimensional generalizations) and which exhibit phenomenology sharply distinct from conventional exceptional points. Saliently, owing to their $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological invariant related to the Witten anomaly, three-fold HEPs and symmetry-protected five-fold HEPs act as their own ``antiparticles". Furthermore, based on higher homotopy groups of spheres, we predict the existence of multifold HEPs and symmetry-protected HEPs with non-Hermitian topology captured by a range of finite groups (such as $\mathbb{Z}_3$, $\mathbb{Z}_{12}$, or $\mathbb{Z}_{24}$) beyond the periodic table of Bernard-LeClair symmetry classes.

Title: Magnetism-Enhanced Strong Electron-Phonon Coupling in Infinite-Layer Nickelate

Abstract: Intriguing analogies between the nickelates and the cuprates provide a promising avenue for unraveling the microscopic mechanisms underlying high-$T_c$ superconductivity. While electron correlation effects in the nickelates have been extensively studied, the role of electron-phonon coupling (EPC) remains highly controversial. Here, by taking pristine LaNiO$_2$ as an exemplar nickelate, we present an in-depth study of EPC for both the non-magnetic (NM) and the $C$-type antiferromagnetic ($C$-AFM) phase using advanced density functional theory methods without invoking $U$ or other free parameters. The weak EPC strength $\lambda$ in the NM phase is found to be greatly enhanced ($\sim$4$\times$) due to the presence of magnetism in the $C$-AFM phase. This enhancement arises from strong interactions between the flat bands associated with the Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals and the low-frequency phonon modes driven by the vibrations of Ni and La atoms. The resulting phonon softening is shown to yield a distinctive kink in the electronic structure around 15 meV, which would provide an experimentally testable signature of our predictions. Our study highlights the critical role of local magnetic moments and interply EPC in the nickelate.

Title: Quantum-gas microscopy of the Bose-glass phase
Authors: Lennart Koehn, Christopher Parsonage, Callum W. Duncan, Peter Kirton, Andrew J. Daley, Timon Hilker, Elmar Haller, Arthur La Rooij, Stefan Kuhr
Abstract: Disordered potentials fundamentally alter the transport properties and coherence of quantum systems. They give rise to phenomena such as Anderson localization in non-interacting systems, inhibiting transport. When interactions are introduced, the interplay with disorder becomes significantly more complex, and the conditions under which localization can be observed remain an open question. In interacting bosonic systems, a Bose glass is expected to emerge at low energies as an insulating yet compressible state without long-range phase coherence. While originally predicted to occur as a ground-state phase, more recent studies indicate that it exists at finite temperature. A key open challenge has been the direct observation of reduced phase coherence in the Bose-glass regime. In this study, we utilize ultracold bosonic atoms in a quantum-gas microscope to probe the emergence of the Bose-glass phase in a two-dimensional square lattice with a site-resolved, reproducible disordered potential. We identify the phase through in-situ distribution and particle fluctuations, via a local measurement of the Edwards-Anderson parameter. To measure the short-range phase coherence in the Bose glass, we employ Talbot interferometry in combination with single-atom-resolved detection. Finally, by driving the system in and out of the Bose-glass phase, we observe signatures for non-ergodic behavior.

Title: Design Topological Materials by Reinforcement Fine-Tuned Generative Model
Authors: Haosheng Xu, Dongheng Qian, Zhixuan Liu, Yadong Jiang, Jing Wang
Abstract: Topological insulators (TIs) and topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) are materials with unconventional electronic properties, making their discovery highly valuable for practical applications. However, such materials, particularly those with a full band gap, remain scarce. Given the limitations of traditional approaches that scan known materials for candidates, we focus on the generation of new topological materials through a generative model. Specifically, we apply reinforcement fine-tuning (ReFT) to a pre-trained generative model, thereby aligning the model's objectives with our material design goals. We demonstrate that ReFT is effective in enhancing the model's ability to generate TIs and TCIs, with minimal compromise on the stability of the generated materials. Using the fine-tuned model, we successfully identify a large number of new topological materials, with Ge$_2$Bi$_2$O$_6$ serving as a representative example--a TI with a full band gap of 0.26 eV, ranking among the largest known in this category.

Title: Quantitative measurements of transverse thermoelectric generation and cooling performances in SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based artificially tilted multilayer module
Authors: Masayuki Murata, Fuyuki Ando, Takamasa Hirai, Hiroto Adachi, Ken-ichi Uchida
Abstract: The transverse thermoelectric generation and cooling performances in a thermopile module composed of recently developed SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers are evaluated quantitatively. When a large temperature difference of 405 $^\circ$C is applied to the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$-based module, the open-circuit voltage and output power reach 0.51 V and 0.80 W, respectively, where the corresponding maximum power density is 0.16 W/cm$^2$. The maximum energy conversion efficiency for our module in this condition is experimentally determined to be 0.92%. Under the cooling operation, the same module exhibits the maximum temperature difference of 9.0 $^\circ$C and heat flow at the cold side of 1.6 W. Although these values are lower than the ideal thermoelectric performance expected from the material parameters due to the imperfections associated with modularization, the systematic investigations reported here clarify a potential of the SmCo$_5$/Bi$_{0.2}$Sb$_{1.8}$Te$_3$ artificially tilted multilayers as thermoelectric generators and cooling devices.

Abstract: The self-assembly of complex structures from engineered subunits is a major goal of nanotechnology, but controlling their size becomes increasingly difficult in larger assemblies. Existing strategies present significant challenges, among which are the use of multiple subunit types or the precise control of their shape and mechanics. Here we introduce an alternative approach based on identical subunits whose interactions promote crystals, but also favor crystalline defects. We theoretically show that topological restrictions on the scope of these defects in large assemblies imply that the assembly size is controlled by the magnitude of the defect-inducing interaction. Using DNA origami, we experimentally demonstrate both size and shape control in two-dimensional disk- and fiber-like assemblies. Our basic concept of defect engineering could be generalized well beyond these simple examples, and thus provide a broadly applicable scheme to control self-assembly.

Title: Instability and stress fluctuations of a probe driven through a worm-like micellar fluid
Authors: Abhishek Ghadai, Pradip Kumar Bera, Sayantan Majumdar
Abstract: A particle moving through a worm-like micellar fluid (WLM) shows instability and large fluctuations beyond a threshold. Despite many detailed studies, a direct measurement of the time-dependent stress on the probe particle remains unexplored. To address this, we have designed a measuring geometry coupled with a commercial rheometer to study the dynamics of a cylindrical probe through a WLM system of 2 wt.\% cetyltrimethyl ammonium tosylate(CTAT) + 100 mM sodium chloride(NaCl) for a wide range of velocity and stress scales. We map out the in-situ velocity distribution using particle imaging velocimetry. Beyond a certain velocity threshold, we observe large stress fluctuation events with gradual stress build-up followed by sudden stress drop indicating the storage and release of elastic energy. The length scale constructed from the stress build-up time scale and the probe's velocity match the length scale of extensile deformation in the sample just before the stress drop, further confirming the strong correlation of such storage and release of energy with the unstable motion of the probe. Interestingly, despite their significant difference in magnitudes, the Weissenberg number ($Wi$) for the onset of flow instability obtained from the shear and extensile components remains almost the same. We also find that the turbulent motion of the probe at higher $Wi$ results from the complex mixing of the stick-slip events originating from the partial release of the stored elastic energy. Further, we show that the magnitude of the stick-slip events depends on the detailed micellar structure and dynamics controlled by salt concentration and temperature.

Title: Many-body cages: disorder-free glassiness from flat bands in Fock space, and many-body Rabi oscillations
Authors: Tom Ben-Ami, Markus Heyl, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: We identify the many-body counterpart of flat bands, which we call many-body caging, as a general mechanism for non-equilibrium phenomena such as a novel type of glassy eigenspectrum order and many-body Rabi oscillations in the time domain. We focus on constrained systems of great current interest in the context of Rydberg atoms and synthetic or emergent gauge theories. We find that their state graphs host motifs which produce flat bands in the many-body spectrum at a particular set of energies. Basis states in Fock space exhibit Edwards-Anderson type parameters in the absence of quenched disorder, with an intricate, possibly fractal, distribution over Fock space which is reflected in a distinctive structure of a non-vanishing post-quench long-time Loschmidt echo, an experimentally accessible this http URL general, phenomena familiar from single-particle flat bands manifest themselves in characteristic many-body incarnations, such as a reentrant `Anderson' delocalisation, offering a rich ensemble of experimental signatures in the abovementioned quantum simulators. The variety of single-particle flat band types suggests an analogous typology--and concomitant phenomenological richness to be explored--of their many-body counterparts.

Title: Giant nematic response of the incommensurate charge density wave in the nickel-pnictide Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Thomas Johnson, Sangjun Lee, Camille Bernal-Choban, Xuefei Guo, Stella Sun, John Collini, Christopher Eckberg, Johnpierre Paglione, Rafael M. Fernandes, Eduardo Fradkin, Peter Abbamonte
Abstract: Electron nematicity-the breaking of rotational symmetry while preserving translational symmetry-is the quantum analogue of classical nematic liquid crystals. First predicted in 1998, electronic nematicity has been established in a variety of materials, including two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) in magnetic fields, copper-oxide superconductors, and Fe-based superconductors. A long-standing open question is what physical mechanisms drive electronic nematic order. In BaFe$_2$As$_2$ and highly underdoped YBa$_2$Cu$_3$O$_{6+y}$, strong evidence suggests that nematicity arises from vestigial spin-density-wave (SDW) order. However, evidence for nematicity associated with charge-density-wave (CDW) order has been less conclusive, particularly in systems near a superconducting state. Here, we present direct evidence for CDW-driven nematic fluctuations in the pnictide superconductor Ba$_{1-x}$Sr$_x$Ni$_2$As$_2$ (BSNA), a Ni-based homologue of Fe-based superconductors that exhibits CDW rather than SDW order. Previous elastoresistance studies have shown that BSNA displays a large nematic susceptibility-linked to a six-fold enhancement of superconductivity-within a region of the phase diagram occupied by an incommensurate CDW. Using x-ray scattering under uniaxial strain, we demonstrate that even minimal strain levels ($\epsilon \sim 10^{-4}$) significantly break the fourfold symmetry of the CDW. Within a Ginzburg-Landau framework, we define a nematic susceptibility based on the asymmetric response of symmetry-related CDW superlattice reflections, showing strong agreement with elastoresistivity measurements. Our study provides the first clear demonstration of a direct link between charge order and a nematic state, offering key insights into the intertwined superconducting phases of these materials.

Title: Topologically enabled superconductivity: possible implications for rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Francesca Paoletti, Daniele Guerci, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Urban F.P. Seifert, Elio J. König
Abstract: We present a topological mechanism for superconductivity emerging from Chern-2 insulators. While, naively, time-reversal symmetry breaking is expected to prevent superconductivity, it turns out that the opposite is the case: An explicit model calculation for a generalized attractive-U Haldane-Hubbard model demonstrates that superconductivity is only stabilized near the quantum anomalous Hall state, but not near a trivial, time-reversal symmetric band insulator. As standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like mean-field theory fails to capture any superconducting state, we explain this using an effective fractionalized field theory involving fermionic chargeons, bosonic colorons and an emergent U(1) gauge field. When the chargeons form a gapped topological band structure, the proliferation of single monopoles of this gauge field is forbidden. However, long-ranged monopole-antimonopole correlations emerge, and we argue that those correspond to superconducting order. Using random phase approximation on top of extensive slave-rotor mean-field calculations we characterize coherence length and stiffness of the superconductor. Thereby, we deduce the phase diagram in parameter space and furthermore discuss the effect of doping, temperature and an external magnetic field. We complement the fractionalized theory with calculations using an effective spin model and Gutzwiller projected wavefunctions. While mostly based on a simple toy model, we argue that our findings contribute to a better understanding of superconductivity emerging out of spin- and valley polarized rhombohedral graphene multilayers in a parameter regime with nearby quantum anomalous Hall insulators.

Title: Work Statistics and Quantum Trajectories: No-Click Limit and non-Hermitian Hamiltonians
Authors: Manali Malakar, Alessandro Silva
Abstract: We present a generalized framework for quantum work statistics in continuously monitored quantum systems that extends the conventional two-point measurement scheme to include the effects of multiple generalized measurements and post-selection of no-click trajectories. By deriving a modified generating function for work, our approach naturally incorporates non-Hermitian dynamics arising from quantum jump processes and reveals deviations from the standard Jarzynski equality due to measurement-induced asymmetries. We illustrate our theoretical framework by analyzing a one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model under local spin monitoring. In this model, increased measurement strength projects the system onto the no-click state, leading to a suppression of energy fluctuations and measurement-induced energy saturation, reminiscent of the quantum Zeno effect.

Title: Causality, localisation, and universality of monitored quantum walks with long-range hopping
Authors: Sayan Roy, Shamik Gupta, Giovanna Morigi
Abstract: Quantum resetting protocols can speed up the time in which a quantum walker reaches a target site on a lattice. In these setups, a detector monitors the target site and the walker motion is restarted if the detector has not clicked after a fixed time interval. The optimal resetting rate can be extracted from the time evolution of the probability $S(t)$ that the detector has not clicked up to time $t$. We analyse $S(t)$ for a quantum walk in a one-dimensional lattice when the coupling between sites decays algebraically as $d^{-\alpha}$ with the distance $d$, for $\alpha\in(0,\infty)$. At long-times, $S(t)$ decays with a universal power-law exponent that is independent of $\alpha$. At short times, $S(t)$ exhibits a plethora of phase transitions as a function of $\alpha$. These lead to the identification of two main regimes for the optimal resetting rate. For $\alpha>1$, the resetting rate $r$ is bounded from below by the velocity with which information propagates causally across the lattice. For $\alpha<1$, instead, the long-range hopping tends to localise the walker: The optimal resetting rate depends on the size of the lattice and diverges as $\alpha\to 0$. We derive simple models reproducing the numerical results, shedding light on the interplay of long-range coherent dynamics, symmetries, and local quantum measurement processes in determining equilibrium. Our predictions can be verified in existing experimental setups.

Title: Universal work extraction in quantum thermodynamics
Authors: Kaito Watanabe, Ryuji Takagi
Abstract: Evaluating the maximum amount of work extractable from a nanoscale quantum system is one of the central problems in quantum thermodynamics. Previous works identified the free energy of the input state as the optimal rate of extractable work under the crucial assumption: experimenters know the description of the given quantum state, which restricts the applicability to significantly limited settings. Here, we show that this optimal extractable work can be achieved without knowing the input states at all, removing the aforementioned fundamental operational restrictions. We achieve this by presenting a universal work extraction protocol, whose description does not depend on input states but nevertheless extracts work quantified by the free energy of the unknown input state. Remarkably, our result partially encompasses the case of infinite-dimensional systems, for which optimal extractable work has not been known even for the standard state-aware setting. Our results clarify that, in spite of the crucial difference between the state-aware and state-agnostic scenarios in accomplishing information-theoretic tasks, whether we are in possession of information on the given state does not influence the optimal performance of the asymptotic work extraction.

Title: Resonances in reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo
Authors: Namu Kroupa, Gábor Csányi, Will Handley
Abstract: In high dimensions, reflective Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with inexact reflections exhibits slow mixing when the particle ensemble is initialised from a Dirac delta distribution and the uniform distribution is targeted. By quantifying the instantaneous non-uniformity of the distribution with the Sinkhorn divergence, we elucidate the principal mechanisms underlying the mixing problems. In spheres and cubes, we show that the collective motion transitions between fluid-like and discretisation-dominated behaviour, with the critical step size scaling as a power law in the dimension. In both regimes, the particles can spontaneously unmix, leading to resonances in the particle density and the aforementioned problems. Additionally, low-dimensional toy models of the dynamics are constructed which reproduce the dominant features of the high-dimensional problem. Finally, the dynamics is contrasted with the exact Hamiltonian particle flow and tuning practices are discussed.

Title: ScarFinder: a detector of optimal scar trajectories in quantum many-body dynamics
Authors: Jie Ren, Andrew Hallam, Lei Ying, Zlatko Papić
Abstract: Mechanisms that give rise to coherent quantum dynamics, such as quantum many-body scars, have recently attracted much interest as a way of controlling quantum chaos. However, identifying the presence of quantum scars in general many-body Hamiltonians remains an outstanding challenge. Here we introduce ScarFinder, a variational framework that reveals possible scar-like dynamics without prior knowledge of scar states or their algebraic structure. By iteratively evolving and projecting states within a low-entanglement variational manifold, ScarFinder isolates scarred trajectories by suppressing thermal contributions. We validate the method on the analytically tractable spin-1 XY model, recovering the known scar dynamics, as well as the mixed field Ising model, where we capture and generalize the initial conditions previously associated with ``weak thermalization''. We then apply the method to the PXP model of Rydberg atom arrays, efficiently characterizing its mixed phase space and finding a previously unknown trajectory with nearly-perfect revival dynamics in the thermodynamic limit. Our results establish ScarFinder as a powerful, model-agnostic tool for identifying and optimizing coherent dynamics in quantum many-body systems.

Title: Finding periodic orbits in projected quantum many-body dynamics
Authors: Elena Petrova, Marko Ljubotina, Gökhan Yalnız, Maksym Serbyn
Abstract: Describing general quantum many-body dynamics is a challenging task due to the exponential growth of the Hilbert space with system size. The time-dependent variational principle (TDVP) provides a powerful tool to tackle this task by projecting quantum evolution onto a classical dynamical system within a variational manifold. In classical systems, periodic orbits play a crucial role in understanding the structure of the phase space and the long-term behavior of the system. However, finding periodic orbits is generally difficult, and their existence and properties in generic TDVP dynamics over matrix product states have remained largely unexplored. In this work, we develop an algorithm to systematically identify and characterize periodic orbits in TDVP dynamics. Applying our method to the periodically kicked Ising model, we uncover both stable and unstable periodic orbits. We characterize the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser tori in the vicinity of stable periodic orbits and track the change of the periodic orbits as we modify the Hamiltonian parameters. We observe that periodic orbits exist at any value of the coupling constant between prethermal and fully thermalizing regimes, but their relevance to quantum dynamics and imprint on quantum eigenstates diminishes as the system leaves the prethermal regime. Our results demonstrate that periodic orbits provide valuable insights into the TDVP approximation of quantum many-body evolution and establish a closer connection between quantum and classical chaos.

Title: Spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric sphere in the modified Langevin noise formalism
Authors: Giovanni Miano, Loris Maria Cangemi, Carlo Forestiere
Abstract: This paper deals with the spectral densities of a dispersive dielectric object in the framework of macroscopic quantum electrodynamics based on the modified Langevin noise formalism. In this formalism, the electromagnetic field in the presence of a dielectric object has two contributions, one taking into account the polarization current fluctuations of the object and the other taking into account the vacuum field fluctuations scattered by the object. The combined effect of these fields on the dynamics of a quantum emitter can be described by means of two independent continuous bosonic reservoirs, a medium-assisted reservoir and a scattering-assisted reservoir, each described by its own spectral density. Therefore, for initial thermal states of the reservoirs having different temperatures, the common approach based on the dyadic Green function of the dielectric object cannot be employed. We study the interaction of a quantum emitter with these two reservoirs introducing a temperature-dependent effective spectral density of the electromagnetic environment, focusing on the case of a homogeneous dielectric sphere. We derive analytical expressions for the medium-assisted, scattering-assisted, and effective spectral densities in this setting. We then study the dynamics of the quantum emitter for initial thermal states of the two reservoirs, adopting a non-perturbative approach.

Title: Searching for Bloch wave packets with (almost) definite momentum direction
Authors: Arseni Goussev, Gregory V. Morozov
Abstract: The motion of a quantum particle in a one-dimensional periodic potential can be described in terms of Bloch wave packets. Like free-particle wave packets, they can propagate without attenuation. Here, we examine this similarity more closely by investigating whether Bloch wave packets can maintain a definite -- or nearly definite -- momentum direction, a property inherent to free-particle wave packets. This question is particularly relevant to the feasibility of using solid-state-based systems in the search for the first experimental realization of quantum backflow, a quantum interference effect in which a particle's probability density flows in a direction opposite to its momentum.

Title: UniqueNESS: Graph Theory Approach to the Uniqueness of Non-Equilibrium Stationary States of the Lindblad Master Equation
Authors: Martin Seltmann, Berislav Buca
Abstract: The dimensionality of kernels for Lindbladian superoperators is of physical interest in various scenarios out of equilibrium, for example in mean-field methods for driven-dissipative spin lattice models that give rise to phase diagrams with a multitude of non-equilibrium stationary states in specific parameter regions. We show that known criteria established in the literature for unique fixpoints of the Lindblad master equation can be better treated in a graph-theoretic framework via a focus on the connectivity of directed graphs associated to the Hamiltonian and jump operators.

Title: Generalization through variance: how noise shapes inductive biases in diffusion models
Authors: John J. Vastola
Abstract: How diffusion models generalize beyond their training set is not known, and is somewhat mysterious given two facts: the optimum of the denoising score matching (DSM) objective usually used to train diffusion models is the score function of the training distribution; and the networks usually used to learn the score function are expressive enough to learn this score to high accuracy. We claim that a certain feature of the DSM objective -- the fact that its target is not the training distribution's score, but a noisy quantity only equal to it in expectation -- strongly impacts whether and to what extent diffusion models generalize. In this paper, we develop a mathematical theory that partly explains this 'generalization through variance' phenomenon. Our theoretical analysis exploits a physics-inspired path integral approach to compute the distributions typically learned by a few paradigmatic under- and overparameterized diffusion models. We find that the distributions diffusion models effectively learn to sample from resemble their training distributions, but with 'gaps' filled in, and that this inductive bias is due to the covariance structure of the noisy target used during training. We also characterize how this inductive bias interacts with feature-related inductive biases.

Title: Multi-qubit nanoscale sensing with entanglement as a resource
Authors: Jared Rovny, Shimon Kolkowitz, Nathalie P. de Leon
Abstract: Nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are widely deployed as local magnetic sensors, using coherent, single qubit control to measure both time-averaged fields and noise with nanoscale spatial resolution. Moving beyond single qubits to multi-qubit control enables new sensing modalities such as measuring nonlocal spatiotemporal correlators, or using entangled states to improve measurement sensitivity. Here, we describe protocols to use optically unresolved NV center pairs and nuclear spins as multi-qubit sensors for measuring correlated noise, enabling covariance magnetometry at nanometer length scales. For NV centers that are optically unresolved but have spectrally resolved spin transitions, we implement a phase-cycling protocol that disambiguates magnetic correlations from variance fluctuations by alternating the relative spin orientations of the two NV centers. For NV centers that are both optically and spectrally unresolved, we leverage the presence of a third qubit, a 13C nucleus that is strongly coupled to one of the NV centers, to effect coherent single-NV spin flips and enable a similar phase-cycling protocol. For length scales around 10 nm, we create maximally entangled Bell states through dipole-dipole coupling between two NV centers, and use these entangled states to directly read out the magnetic field correlation, rather than reconstructing it from independent measurements of unentangled NV centers. Importantly, this changes the scaling of sensitivity with readout noise from quadratic to linear. For conventional off-resonant readout of the NV center spin state (for which the readout noise is roughly 30 times the quantum projection limit), this results in a dramatic sensitivity improvement. Finally, we demonstrate methods for the detection of high spatial- and temporal-resolution correlators with pairs of strongly interacting NV centers.

Title: Topologically Directed Simulations Reveal the Impact of Geometric Constraints on Knotted Proteins
Authors: Agnese Barbensi, Alexander R. Klotz, Dimos Gkountaroulis
Abstract: Simulations of knotting and unknotting in polymers or other filaments rely on random processes to facilitate topological changes. Here we introduce a method of \textit{topological steering} to determine the optimal pathway by which a filament may knot or unknot while subject to a given set of physics. The method involves measuring the knotoid spectrum of a space curve projected onto many surfaces and computing the mean unravelling number of those projections. Several perturbations of a curve can be generated stochastically, e.g. using the Langevin equation or crankshaft moves, and a gradient can be followed that maximises or minimises the topological complexity. We apply this method to a polymer model based on a growing self-avoiding tangent-sphere chain, which can be made to model proteins by imposing a constraint that the bending and twisting angles between successive spheres must maintain the distribution found in naturally occurring protein structures. We show that without these protein-like geometric constraints, topologically optimised polymers typically form alternating torus knots and composites thereof, similar to the stochastic knots predicted for long DNA. However, when the geometric constraints are imposed on the system, the frequency of twist knots increases, similar to the observed abundance of twist knots in protein structures.

Title: A Two-Phase Perspective on Deep Learning Dynamics
Authors: Robert de Mello Koch, Animik Ghosh
Abstract: We propose that learning in deep neural networks proceeds in two phases: a rapid curve fitting phase followed by a slower compression or coarse graining phase. This view is supported by the shared temporal structure of three phenomena: grokking, double descent and the information bottleneck, all of which exhibit a delayed onset of generalization well after training error reaches zero. We empirically show that the associated timescales align in two rather different settings. Mutual information between hidden layers and input data emerges as a natural progress measure, complementing circuit-based metrics such as local complexity and the linear mapping number. We argue that the second phase is not actively optimized by standard training algorithms and may be unnecessarily prolonged. Drawing on an analogy with the renormalization group, we suggest that this compression phase reflects a principled form of forgetting, critical for generalization.

Title: Combining the Maximum Overlap Method with Multiwavelets for Core-Ionisation Energy Calculations
Authors: Niklas Göllmann, Matthew R. Ludwig, Peter Wind, Laura Ratcliff, Luca Frediani
Abstract: We present a protocol for computing core-ionisation energies for molecules, which is essential for reproducing X-Ray photoelectron spectroscopy experiments. The electronic structure of both the ground state and the core-ionised states are computed using Multiwavelets and Density-Functional Theory, where the core ionisation energies are computed by virtue of the $\Delta$SCF method. To avoid the collapse of the core-hole state or its delocalisation, we make use of the Maximum Overlap Method, which provides a constraint on the orbital occupation. Combining Multiwavelets with the Maximum Overlap Method allows for the first time an all-electron calculation of core-ionisation energies with Multiwavelets, avoiding known issues connected to the use of Atomic Orbitals (slow convergence with respect to the basis set limit, numerical instabilities of core-hole states for large systems). We show that our results are consistent with previous Multiwavelet calculations which made use of pseudopotentials, and are generally more precise than corresponding Atomic Orbital calculations. We analyse the results in terms of precision compared to both Atomic Orbital calculations and Multiwavelets+pseudopotentials calculations. Moreover, we demonstrate how the protocol can be applied to target molecules of relatively large size. Both closed-shell and open-shell methods have been implemented.

Title: Macroscopic states and operations: a generalized resource theory of coherence
Authors: Teruaki Nagasawa, Eyuri Wakakuwa, Kohtaro Kato, Francesco Buscemi
Abstract: To understand the emergence of macroscopic irreversibility from microscopic reversible dynamics, the idea of coarse-graining plays a fundamental role. In this work, we focus on the concept of macroscopic states, i.e. coarse representations of microscopic details, defined as states that can be inferred solely from the outcomes of macroscopic measurements. Building on the theories of quantum statistical sufficiency and quantum Bayesian retrodiction, we characterize macroscopic states through several equivalent formulations, ranging from algebraic to explicitly constructive. We introduce a hierarchy of macroscopicity-non-decreasing operations and develop a resource theory of microscopicity that unifies and generalizes existing resource theories of coherence, athermality, purity, and asymmetry. Finally, we introduce the concept of inferential reference frames and reinterpret macroscopic entropy as a measure of inferential asymmetry, i.e., irretrodictability.

Title: Single Complex-Frequency Resonance Mode in an Engineered Disordered Time-Varying Cavity
Authors: Zhou Bo, Guo Xianmin, Feng Xinsong, Chen Hongsheng, Wang Zuojia
Abstract: We propose a straightforward mechanism for achieving unique $k$-space resonance modes in one-dimensional time-varying cavities where periodic temporal modulation creates momentum band gaps through Floquet dynamics. By engineering the synergy between cavity resonance conditions and Floquet mode formation in photonic time crystals, we demonstrate the emergence of a single dominant momentum state that exhibits remarkable robustness against temporal disorder. Through analytical modeling and numerical verification, we show that the interplay between time-varying medium and cavity boundary conditions leads to amplification of specific waves followed by spatial mode selection. This engineered resonance mechanism enables insensitivity to initial wave source configuration and strong temporal disorder immunity. Our findings give a simple mechanism for exploiting narrow momentum bandgaps, and establish a foundation for developing high-quality temporal cavity lasers and advancing extreme temporal predictability in time-modulated systems.

Title: Phase field model of Coulomb explosion damage in solid induced by ultrashort laser
Authors: Lihong Ao, Qin Zhang
Abstract: Much experimental evidence reveals that Coulomb explosion governs non-thermal material removal under femtosecond or even shorter laser pulses, and non-thermal laser damage has been a topic widely discussed. Nevertheless, there is still no continuum mechanical model capable of describing the evolution of such damage. In this study, we develop a model that characterizes solid damage through a phase field variable governed by Allen-Cahn dynamics. The parameter of the model is defined by a conceptual mechanism: during Coulomb explosion, electron pressure surpasses the interatomic barrier potential, dissociates material from the solid surface as small equivalent particles and resulting in localized damage. The numerical simulation validates the model's availability and demonstrate its ability to predict damage morphology under varying laser conditions. This work advances the understanding of non-thermal ablation and provides a tool for optimizing ultrafast laser processing.

Title: Exact Learning Dynamics of In-Context Learning in Linear Transformers and Its Application to Non-Linear Transformers
Authors: Nischal Mainali, Lucas Teixeira
Abstract: Transformer models exhibit remarkable in-context learning (ICL), adapting to novel tasks from examples within their context, yet the underlying mechanisms remain largely mysterious. Here, we provide an exact analytical characterization of ICL emergence by deriving the closed-form stochastic gradient descent (SGD) dynamics for a simplified linear transformer performing regression tasks. Our analysis reveals key properties: (1) a natural separation of timescales directly governed by the input data's covariance structure, leading to staged learning; (2) an exact description of how ICL develops, including fixed points corresponding to learned algorithms and conservation laws constraining the dynamics; and (3) surprisingly nonlinear learning behavior despite the model's linearity. We hypothesize this phenomenology extends to non-linear models. To test this, we introduce theory-inspired macroscopic measures (spectral rank dynamics, subspace stability) and use them to provide mechanistic explanations for (1) the sudden emergence of ICL in attention-only networks and (2) delayed generalization (grokking) in modular arithmetic models. Our work offers an exact dynamical model for ICL and theoretically grounded tools for analyzing complex transformer training.

Title: Cavity-enhanced spectroscopy of individual nuclear spins in a dense bath
Authors: Alexander Ulanowski, Olivier Kuijpers, Benjamin Merkel, Adrian Holzäpfel, Andreas Reiserer
Abstract: Echo-based spectroscopy of the superhyperfine interaction of an electronic spin with nuclear spins in its surroundings enables detailed insights into the microscopic magnetic environment of spins in solids. Still, it is an outstanding challenge to resolve individual nuclear spins in a dense bath, in which many of them exhibit a comparable coupling strength. This simultaneously requires a high spectral resolution and a large signal-to-noise ratio. However, when probing spin ensembles, dipolar interactions between the dopants can lead to a concentration-dependent trade-off between resolution and signal. Here, we fully eliminate this limitation of previous optical-echo-envelope-modulation spectroscopy experiments by integrating the emitters into a high-finesse resonator, which allows for strong optical echoes even at very low concentrations. To demonstrate its potential, the technique is applied to erbium dopants in yttrium-orthosilicate (Er:YSO). Achieving an unprecedented spectral resolution enables precise measurements of the superhyperfine interaction with four of the Y nuclear spins densely surrounding each emitter. The achieved boost of the signal, enabled by the resonator, allows for extending the approach to the lowest concentration possible -- to the level of single dopants, thereby providing a tool for detecting and studying individual nuclear spins. Thus, our technique paves the way for an improved understanding of dense nuclear spin baths in solids.

Title: Competing Bosonic Reactions: Insight from Exactly Solvable Time-Dependent Models
Authors: Fumika Suzuki, Rajesh K. Malla, Nikolai A. Sinitsyn
Abstract: We discuss the progress on exactly solvable multistate Landau-Zener models from a perspective of their application to competing reactions of particle creation from a false vacuum. Such models generally predict that, even with identical initial conditions, and for nearly the same other particle parameters, a quantum coherent evolution results in a final particle distribution with significant asymmetry. We use an exact solution of the driven bosonic Tavis-Cummings model for two reaction pathways in order to quantify this effect, reveal a corresponding phase transition, and identify its universality class.

Title: Seeing Beyond Dark-Field RGB Capabilities: Deep Spectral Extrapolation of Ultrasmall Plasmonic Nanogaps

Abstract: Localized surface plasmons can confine light within a deep-subwavelength volume comparable to the scale of atoms and molecules, enabling ultrasensitive responses to near-field variations. On the other hand, this extreme localization also inevitably amplifies the unwanted noise from the response of local morphological imperfections, leading to complex spectral variations and reduced consistency across the plasmonic nanostructures. Seeking uniform optical responses has therefore long been a sought-after goal in nanoplasmonics. However, conventional probing techniques by dark-field (DF) confocal microscopy, such as image analysis or spectral measurements, can be inaccurate and time-consuming, respectively. Here, we introduce SPARX, a deep-learning-powered paradigm that surpasses conventional imaging and spectroscopic capabilities. In particular, SPARX can batch-predict broadband DF spectra (e.g., 500-1000 nm) of numerous nanoparticles simultaneously from an information-limited RGB image (i.e., below 700 nm). It achieves this extrapolative inference beyond the camera's capture capabilities by learning the underlying physical relationships among multiple orders of optical resonances. The spectral predictions only take milliseconds, achieving a speedup of three to four orders of magnitude compared to traditional spectral acquisition, which may take from hours to days. As a proof-of-principle demonstration for screening identical resonances, the selection accuracy achieved by SPARX is comparable to that of conventional spectroscopy techniques. This breakthrough paves the way for consistent plasmonic applications and next-generation microscopies.

Abstract: Integrating solid-state spin defects into classical electronic devices can enable new opportunities for quantum information processing that benefit from existing semiconductor technology. We show, through bias control of an isotopically purified silicon carbide (SiC) p-i-n diode, the depletion of not only electrical noise sources but also magnetic noise sources, resulting in record coherences for SiC electron spin qubits. We also uncover complementary improvements to the relaxation times of nuclear spin registers controllable by the defect, and measure diode-enhanced coherences. These improvements lead to record-long nuclear spin Hahn-echo times on the scale of minutes. These results demonstrate the power of materials control and electronic device integration to create highly coherent solid-state quantum network nodes and processors.

Title: Statistical mechanics model for Clifford random tensor networks and monitored quantum circuits
Authors: Yaodong Li, Romain Vasseur, Matthew P. A. Fisher, Andreas W. W. Ludwig
Abstract: We introduce an exact mapping of Clifford (stabilizer) random tensor networks (RTNs) and monitored quantum circuits, onto a statistical mechanics model. With Haar unitaries, the fundamental degrees of freedom ('spins') are permutations because all operators commuting with the action of the unitaries on a tensor product arise from permutations of the tensor factors ('Schur-Weyl duality'). For unitaries restricted to the smaller Clifford group, the set of commuting operators, the 'commutant', forming the new 'spin' degrees of freedom, will be larger. We use the recent full characterization of this commutant by Gross et al., Comm. Math. Phys. 385, 1325 (2021), to construct the Clifford statistical mechanics models for on-site Hilbert space dimensions which are powers of a prime number $p$. We show that the Boltzmann weights are invariant under a symmetry group involving orthogonal matrices with entries in the finite number field ${\bf F}_p$. This implies that the symmetry group, and consequently all universal properties of entanglement transitions in Clifford circuits and RTNs will in general depend on, and only on the prime $p$. We show that Clifford monitored circuits with on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p^M$ are described by percolation in the limits $d \to \infty$ at (a) $p=$ fixed but $M\to \infty$, and at (b) $M= 1$ but $p \to \infty$. In the limit (a) we calculate the effective central charge, and in the limit (b) we derive the following universal minimal cut entanglement entropy $S_A =(\sqrt{3}/\pi)\ln p \ln L_A$ for $d=p$ large at the transition. We verify those predictions numerically, and present extensive numerical results for critical exponents at the transition in monitored Clifford circuits for prime number on-site Hilbert space dimension $d=p$ for a variety of different values of $p$, and find that they approach percolation values at large $p$.

Title: Simulating the anharmonic phonon spectrum in critical systems: self-consistent phonons and temperature-dependent effective potential methods
Authors: Lorenzo Monacelli
Abstract: Understanding and simulating the thermodynamic and dynamical properties of materials affected by strong ionic anharmonicity is a central challenge in material science. Much interest is in material displaying critical displacive behaviour, such as near a ferroelectric transition, charge-density waves, or in general displacive second-order transitions. In these cases, molecular dynamics suffer from a critical slowdown and emergent long-range fluctuations of the order parameter. Two prominent methods have emerged to solve this issue: Self-consistent renormalization of the phonons like the Self-Consistent Harmonic Approximation (SCHA) and Self-Consistent Phonons (SCP), and methods that fit the potential energy landscape from short molecular dynamics trajectories, like the Temperature-Dependent Effective Potential (TDEP). Despite their widespread use, the limitations of these methods are often overlooked in the proximity of critical points. Here, we establish a guiding rule set for the accuracy of each method on critical quantities: free energy for computing the phase diagrams, static correlation functions for inferring phase stability and critical behaviours, and dynamic correlation functions for vibrational spectra and thermal transport. Also, a new TDEP implementation is introduced to fix the calculation of dynamical spectra, restoring the correct perturbative limit violated by the standard TDEP approach. Results are benchmarked both against an exact one-dimensional anharmonic potential and two prototypical anharmonic crystals: the ferroelectric PbTe and the metal-halide perovskite CsSnI3.

Title: Flat Surface State with Octupole Moment in an $e_g$ Orbital System on a Simple Cubic Lattice
Authors: Katsunori Kubo
Abstract: A tight-binding model for $e_g$ orbitals on a simple cubic lattice with finite thickness is investigated. The hopping integrals for nearest-neighboring sites are considered. We examine the electronic band structures for systems with (001), (110), and (111) surfaces. Electronic states well localized around the surfaces are found for the (110) and (111) surfaces. In particular, the surface state is flat and extends in the entire Brillouin zone for the (111) surface, provided the bulk band projected onto the surface Brillouin zone is gapped. We also find that these surface states possess octupole moments in both the (110) and (111) surface cases.

Title: Microscopic theory of Rashba-Edelstein magnetoresistance
Authors: Masaki Yama, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: We theoretically study Rashba-Edelstein magnetoresistance (REMR) in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) system with Rashba and Dresselhaus spin-orbit interactions. We consider a microscopic model of a junction system composed of a ferromagnetic insulator and a 2DEG, and derive analytic expressions for the spin and current densities in the 2DEG using the Boltzmann equation, while taking into account dynamical contributions from magnons. Our findings reveal that the sign of the REMR varies depending on the type of interface. We also discuss the experimental relevance of our results.

Title: Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for the thermodynamics of fluctuations in a generalised 2+1D Gross-Neveu model
Authors: Biplab Mahato, David Blaschke, Dietmar Ebert
Abstract: We study a generalized version of the Gross-Neveu model in 2+1 dimensions. The model is inspired from Graphene, which shows a linear dispersion relation near the Dirac points. The phase structure and the thermodynamic properties in the mean field approximation have been studied before. Here, we go beyond the mean field level by deriving a Beth-Uhlenbeck equation for Gaussian fluctuations formulated in phase shift solutions, which we explore numerically, for the first time including their momentum dependence. We discuss the excitonic mass, fluctuation pressure, and phase shifts. The inclusion of momentum dependence in the phase shift shows a significant difference from the Lorentz-boosted version of the phase shift previously used in the literature. We find resurrection of the pseudoscalar bound states at large momentum above Mott temperature and show that the presence of Landau modes significantly contributes to the fluctuation pressure.

Title: Magnetoconductivity of Dirac semimetals and chiral magnetic effect from Keldysh technique
Authors: R.A. Abramchuk, M.A.Zubkov
Abstract: Negative magnetoresistance in Dirac semimetals is typically considered as a manifestation of chiral magnetic effect (CME). The relation between these two phenomena has the status of a hypothesis and is based on sequence of assumptions. We rely on the Keldysh technique of non-equilibrium theory. It allows us to investigate the accumulation of axial charge -- the process that involves both chiral anomaly and relaxation followed by the energy dissipation. We consider the case of strong magnetic field and calculate directly both axial charge density and electric conductivity taking into account both scattering on impurities and interaction with phonons. We obtain the same dependence of axial charge density on electric and magnetic fields, and the same dependence of electric current on axial charge density as the standard heuristic CME calculation. This confirms (in the limit of strong magnetic fields) the hypothesis that the origin of magnetoconductivity in Dirac semimetals is the CME.

Title: Resonant second harmonic generation in a two-dimensional electron system
Authors: Maxim Dzero, Jaglul Hasan, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We consider the nonlinear response of a disordered two-dimensional electronic system, lacking inversion symmetry, to an external alternating electric field. The application of an in-plane static magnetic field induces local contributions to the current density that are quadratic in the electric field and linear in the magnetic field. This current oscillates at twice the frequency of the external irradiation and there are two linearly independent vector combinations that contribute to the current density. This particular mechanism coexists with the topological Berry-dipole contribution to the second harmonic of the current density, which can be generated by quantum confinement. Additional nonlocal terms in the current density are possible in the regime away from the normal incidence. The total current exhibits a nonreciprocal character upon reversal of the magnetic field direction. We evaluate the magnitude of this effect by computing its dependence on the strength of spin-orbit coupling and the disorder scattering rate. Importantly, we show that these local second-harmonic contributions can be resonantly excited when the frequency of the external radiation approaches the energy separation between the spin-orbit split bands.

Title: Scaling theory for the collapse of a trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field: a critical study at the condensation point
Authors: Bikram Keshari Behera, Shyamal Biswas
Abstract: We have analytically explored both the zero temperature and the finite temperature scaling theory for the collapse of an attractively interacting 3-D harmonically trapped Bose gas in a synthetic magnetic field. We have considered short-ranged (contact) attractive inter-particle interactions and Hartree-Fock approximation for the same. We have separately studied the collapse of both the condensate and the thermal cloud below and above the condensation point, respectively. We have obtained an anisotropy, artificial magnetic field, and temperature-dependent critical number of particles for the collapse of the condensate. We have found a dramatic change in the critical exponent (from $\alpha=1$ to $0$) of the specific heat ($C_v\propto|T-T_c|^{\alpha}$) when the thermal cloud is about to collapse with the critical number of particles ($N=N_c$) just below and above the condensation point. All the results obtained by us below and around the condensation point are experimentally testable within the present-day experimental set-up for the ultracold systems in the magneto-optical traps.

Title: Free Convolution and Generalized Dyson Brownian Motion
Authors: Pierre Bousseyroux, Jean-Philippe Bouchaud
Abstract: The eigenvalue spectrum of the sum of large random matrices that are mutually "free", i.e., randomly rotated, can be obtained using the formalism of R-transforms, with many applications in different fields. We provide a direct interpretation of the otherwise abstract additivity property of R-transforms for the sum in terms of a dynamical evolution of "particles" (the eigenvalues), interacting through two-body and higher-body forces and subject to a Gaussian noise, generalizing the usual Dyson Brownian motion with Coulomb interaction. Interestingly, the appearance of an outlier outside of the bulk of the spectrum is signalled by a divergence of the "velocity" of the generalized Dyson motion. We extend our result to products of free matrices.

Title: Incommensurate spin-fluctuations and competing pairing symmetries in La3Ni2O7
Authors: Han-Xiang Xu, Daniel Guterding
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in the bilayer Ruddlesden-Popper nickelate La3Ni2O7 under high pressure has generated much interest in the superconducting pairing mechanism of nickelates. Despite extensive theoretical work, the superconducting pairing symmetry in La3Ni2O7 remains unresolved, with conflicting results even for identical methods. This inconsistency has obscured the pairing mechanism and raised questions about the validity of simplified models. We argue that different superconducting states in La3Ni2O7 are in close competition and highly sensitive to the choice of interaction parameters as well as pressure-induced changes in the electronic structure. Our study uses a multi-orbital Hubbard model, incorporating all Ni 3d and O 2p states. We analyze the superconducting pairing mechanism of La3Ni2O7 within the random phase approximation and find a transition between d-wave and sign-changing s-wave pairing states as a function of pressure and interaction parameters, which is driven by spin-fluctuations with different wave vectors. These spin-fluctuations with incommensurate wave vectors cooperatively stabilize a superconducting order parameter with dx2-y2 symmetry for realistic model parameters. Simultaneously, their competition may be responsible for the absence of magnetic order in La3Ni2O7, demonstrating that magnetic frustration and superconducting pairing can arise from the same set of incommensurate spin-fluctuations.

Title: Dualities between 2+1d fusion surface models from braided fusion categories
Authors: Luisa Eck
Abstract: Fusion surface models generalize the concept of anyon chains to 2+1 dimensions, utilizing fusion 2-categories as their input. We investigate bond-algebraic dualities in these systems and show that distinct module tensor categories $\mathcal{M}$ over the same braided fusion category $\mathcal{B}$ give rise to dual lattice models. This extends the 1+1d result that dualities in anyon chains are classified by module categories over fusion categories. We analyze two concrete examples: (i) a $\text{Rep}(S_3)$ model with a constrained Hilbert space, dual to the spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ XXZ model on the honeycomb lattice, and (ii) a bilayer Kitaev honeycomb model, dual to a spin-$\tfrac{1}{2}$ model with XXZ and Ising interactions. Unlike regular $\mathcal{M}=\mathcal{B}$ fusion surface models, which conserve only 1-form symmetries, models constructed from $\mathcal{M} \neq \mathcal{B}$ can exhibit both 1-form and 0-form symmetries, including non-invertible ones.

Title: Upper critical fields in normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers
Authors: Kelsey B. Robbins, Pukar Sedai, Alexandra J. Howzen, Robert M. Klaes, Reza Loloee, Norman O. Birge, Nathan Satchell
Abstract: The role of spin orbit interaction in superconducting proximity effect is an area of intense research effort. Recent theoretical and experimental works investigate the possible role of spin-orbit interaction in generating spin-triplet pair correlations. In this work, we present an experimental survey of thin normal metal-superconductor-normal metal trilayers with Nb superconductor and Al, Ti, Cu, Pt, Ta, and Au normal metals, along with single layers of Nb as reference. We aim to probe the role of spin-orbit interaction and resistivity on the normal metal proximity effect through measurements of the upper critical field. We find that the upper critical fields of the trilayers are lower than that of a single layer Nb reference sample, and that the trilayers with higher resistivity metals, Ti, Pt, and Ta, behave as 2-dimensional superconductors. At low applied in-plane magnetic fields and temperatures close to the zero field transition temperature, we find a possible deviation from 2-dimensional to 3-dimensional behavior in the Ti and Pt trilayers. We also find that compared to single layer Nb films, all of our trilayers show a greater suppression of critical temperature during rotation from an in-plane to an out-of-plane applied magnetic field, with the greatest suppression observed in trilayers with Au or Al. This suppression of the critical temperature under field rotation might appear analogous to the colossal spin valve effect that can be achieved in systems with ferromagnetic materials; however, in our trilayers, only conventional orbital screening contributions to the suppression are present and the additional suppression is not present in the absence of applied magnetic field.

Title: Towards numerically exact computation of conductivity in the thermodynamic limit of interacting lattice models
Authors: Jeremija Kovačević, Michel Ferrero, Jakša Vučičević
Abstract: Computing dynamical response functions in interacting lattice models is a long standing challenge in condensed matter physics. In view of recent results, the dc resistivity $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ in the weak coupling regime of the Hubbard model is of great interest, yet it is not fully understood. The challenge lies in having to work with large lattices while avoiding analytical continuation. The weak-coupling $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ results were so far computed at the level of the Boltzmann theory and at the level of the Kubo bubble approximation, which neglects vertex corrections. Neither theory was so far rigorously proven to give exact results even at infinitesimal coupling, and the respective dc resistivity results differ greatly. In this work we develop, cross-check and apply two state-of-the-art methods for obtaining dynamical response functions. We compute the optical conductivity at weak coupling in the Hubbard model in a fully controlled way, in the thermodynamic limit and without analytical continuation. We show that vertex corrections persist to infinitesimal coupling, with a constant ratio to the Kubo bubble. We connect our methods with the Boltzmann theory, and show that the latter applies additional approximations, which lead to quantitatively incorrect scaling of $\rho_\mathrm{dc}$ with respect to the coupling constant.

Title: Speedups in nonequilibrium thermal relaxation: Mpemba and related effects
Authors: Gianluca Teza, John Bechhoefer, Antonio Lasanta, Oren Raz, Marija Vucelja
Abstract: Most of our intuition about the behavior of physical systems is shaped by observations at or near thermal equilibrium. However, even a thermal quench can lead to states far from thermal equilibrium, where counterintuitive, anomalous effects can occur. A prime example of anomalous thermal relaxation is the Mpemba effect, in which a system prepared at a hot temperature cools down to the temperature of the cold environment faster than an identical system prepared at a warm temperature. Although reported for water more than 2000 years ago by Aristotle, the recent observations of analogous relaxation speedups in a variety of systems have motivated the search for general explanations. We review anomalous relaxation effects, which all share a nonmonotonic dependence of relaxation time versus initial ``distance" from the final state or from the phase transition. The final state can be an equilibrium or a nonequilibrium steady state. We first review the water experiments and classify the anomalous relaxation phenomena related to the Mpemba effect. We then provide a modern definition of the Mpemba effect, focusing on the theoretical frameworks of stochastic thermodynamics, kinetic theory, Markovian dynamics, and phase transitions. We discuss the recent experimental and numerical developments that followed these theoretical advances. These developments paved the way for the prediction and observation of novel phenomena, such as the inverse Mpemba effect. The review is self-contained and introduces anomalous relaxation phenomena in single- and many-body systems, both classical and quantum. We also discuss the broader relevance of the Mpemba effect, including its relation with phase transitions and its experimental implications. We end with perspectives that connect anomalous speedups to ideas for designing optimal heating/cooling protocols, heat engines, and efficient samplers.

Title: SymmCD: Symmetry-Preserving Crystal Generation with Diffusion Models
Authors: Daniel Levy, Siba Smarak Panigrahi, Sékou-Oumar Kaba, Qiang Zhu, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Mikhail Galkin, Santiago Miret, Siamak Ravanbakhsh
Abstract: Generating novel crystalline materials has the potential to lead to advancements in fields such as electronics, energy storage, and catalysis. The defining characteristic of crystals is their symmetry, which plays a central role in determining their physical properties. However, existing crystal generation methods either fail to generate materials that display the symmetries of real-world crystals, or simply replicate the symmetry information from examples in a database. To address this limitation, we propose SymmCD, a novel diffusion-based generative model that explicitly incorporates crystallographic symmetry into the generative process. We decompose crystals into two components and learn their joint distribution through diffusion: 1) the asymmetric unit, the smallest subset of the crystal which can generate the whole crystal through symmetry transformations, and; 2) the symmetry transformations needed to be applied to each atom in the asymmetric unit. We also use a novel and interpretable representation for these transformations, enabling generalization across different crystallographic symmetry groups. We showcase the competitive performance of SymmCD on a subset of the Materials Project, obtaining diverse and valid crystals with realistic symmetries and predicted properties.

Title: High-accuracy evaluation of non-thermal magnetic states beyond spin-wave theory: applications to higher-energy states
Authors: Wesley Roberts, Michael Vogl, Roderich Moessner, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We present an approximation scheme based on selective Hilbert space truncation for characterizing non-thermal states of magnetic systems beyond spin-wave theory. We study applications to states that are inaccessible through linear spin-wave theory, such as multi-magnon states and higher-energy states. Our approach is based on the existence of an exact representation of spin operators in terms of finite-order polynomials of bosonic operators. It can be applied to systems with and without a magnetically ordered ground state. The approximation exactly diagonalizes the bosonic Hamiltonian restricted to particular boson occupation subspaces, improving the conventional linear spin-wave approach and exponentially reducing the computing time relative to exact diagonalization schemes. As a test case, we apply the approach to a prototypical one-dimensional model - an XXZ spin chain with an applied magnetic field and antisymmetric exchange coupling. Here the antisymmetric coupling introduces a continuous parameter to tune the system away from its exactly solvable limit. We find excellent agreement between numerically exact eigenstates and eigenvalues and those found via the approximation scheme. Our approach applies not just to higher lying states but also to boson bound states, which could make them more accessible to theoretical predictions for comparison with experiment.

Title: Topolectrical circuits $-$ recent experimental advances and developments
Authors: Haydar Sahin, Mansoor B. A. Jalil, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Metamaterials serve as versatile platforms for demonstrating condensed matter physics and non-equilibrium phenomena, with electrical circuits emerging as a particularly compelling medium. This review highlights recent advances in the experimental circuit realizations of topological, non-Hermitian, non-linear, Floquet and other notable phenomena. Initially performed mostly with passive electrical components, topolectrical circuits have evolved to incorporate active elements such as operational amplifiers and analog multipliers that combine to form negative impedance converters, complex phase elements, high-frequency temporal modulators and self-feedback mechanisms. This review provides a summary of these contemporary studies and discusses the broader potential of electrical circuits in physics.

Title: Nonreciprocal Current-induced Zero-Resistance State in Valley-Polarized Superconductors
Authors: Akito Daido, Youichi Yanase, Kam Tuen Law
Abstract: The recently observed nonreciprocal current-induced zero-resistance state (CIZRS) in twisted trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure has posed a significant theoretical challenge. Therein, the system shows a zero-resistance state only when a sufficiently large current is applied in a particular direction, while stays in an incipient superconducting state with small resistance when the current is small or in the opposite direction. In this Letter, we provide a theory for this phenomenon using a model that encapsulates valley polarization and trigonal warping inherent to the trilayer graphene/WSe$_2$ heterostructure. We elucidate that threefold-degenerate Fulde-Ferrell (FF) states are stabilized, and establish the thermodynamic phase diagram in electric current that manifests the switching behavior of different FF states. We thereby propose a scenario that predicts CIZRS in the presence of domains of different FF states: The incipient superconducting state in small current is naturally understood as a multi-domain state, wherein the inter-domain supercurrent is difficult to flow due to the tiny Josephson coupling caused by the mismatch of Cooper-pair momenta. Nevertheless, a sufficiently large current in a particular direction can selectively populate a certain FF state and create mono-domain pathways with zero resistance. Crucially, due to the threefold symmetry of the system, a current flowing in the opposite direction fails to generate these zero-resistance pathways, thus giving rise to the observed nonreciprocity. Finally, we suggest that the long-sought-after triangular finite-momentum state can also be realized in valley-polarized superconductors.

Title: An all-electrical scheme for valley polarization in graphene
Authors: Sachchidanand Das, Abhiram Soori
Abstract: We propose an all-electrical setup to generate valley polarization in graphene. A finite graphene sheet is connected to two normal metal electrodes along its zigzag edges, with armchair edges left free. When a bias is applied at one terminal and the others are grounded, valley polarization arises from transverse momentum matching between graphene and the normal metal. Significant polarization occurs when the Fermi wave vector in the metal exceeds half the \( K \)--\( K' \) valley separation. We analyze the dependence of conductance and valley polarization on geometric and electronic parameters, and show that while increased width enhances both, increased length leads to Fabry--Pérot oscillations and suppresses polarization due to intervalley mixing. Disorder near the Dirac point enhances conductance but reduces polarization. Our findings offer a route to electrical control of valley degrees of freedom in graphene-based devices.

Title: Symmetrizing the Constraints -- Density Matrix Renormalization Group for Constrained Lattice Models
Authors: Ting-Tung Wang, Xiaoxue Ran, Zi Yang Meng
Abstract: We develop a density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) algorithm for constrained quantum lattice models that successfully {\it{implements the local constraints as symmetries in the contraction of the matrix product states and matrix product operators}}. Such an implementation allows us to investigate a quantum dimer model in DMRG for any lattice geometry wrapped around a cylinder with substantial circumference. We have thence computed the ground state phase diagram of the quantum dimer model on triangular lattice, with the symmetry-breaking characteristics of the columnar solid phase and $\sqrt{12}\times\sqrt{12}$ valence bond solid phase fully captured, as well as the topological entanglement entropy of the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ quantum spin liquid phase that extends to the RK point on non-bipartite lattice accurately revealed. Our DMRG algorithm on constrained quantum lattice models opens new opportunities for matrix and tensor-based algorithms for these systems that have immediate relevance towards the frustrated quantum magnets and synthetic quantum simulators.

Title: Quantum controlling and the topological properties of the magnon photo-transport in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnet
Authors: Jun-Cen Li, An Du
Abstract: In our work, we study magnon transport induced by light through Aharonov-Casher (AC) effect, including magnon spin photocurrent (MSPC) and magnon energy photocurrent (MEPC). Firstly, we regard the effect of the electric field on the magnon through the AC effect as a perturbation. Then we derived the expressions of MSPC and MEPC in two-dimensional collinear ferromagnetic system. And we apply our theory to the two-dimension ferromagnetic Hexagonal and Kagome lattice. We find that the optical frequency and the relaxation time of the material can be used to control the photo-transport of magnons. In addition, under the condition of low light frequncy and infinite relaxation time, the longitudinal magnon photo-transport is related to the topological property of the magnon system.

Title: Resistive switching and charge accumulation in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanoparticles

Koptiev, Mikhail D. Volnyanskii, Valentin V. Laguta, Eugene A. Eliseev, Mikhail P. Trubitsyn, Anna N. Morozovska
Abstract: We revealed the resistive switching, negative differential resistance and charge accumulation effects in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders sintered by the auto-combustion sol-gel method and annealed at temperatures from 500°C to 800°C. The fraction of the orthorhombic phase, determined by the X-ray diffraction (XRD), decreases from 91 vol.% to 7 vol.% with an increase in the annealing temperature from 600°C to 800°C. The electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra reveal the great amount of oxygen vacancies in the annealed samples, at that the decrease of the orthorhombic phase fraction (observed with an increase in the annealing temperature) correlates with a decrease in the intensity of EPR spectral lines associated with the oxygen vacancies and impurities. This indicates the participation of oxygen vacancies and other defects in the formation of the orthorhombic phase in the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders. To explain the results of electrophysical measurements, we compare the features of the current-voltage characteristics with the phase composition of the Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 powders and with the peculiarities of their EPR spectra. The analysis allows us to relate the resistive switching and charge accumulation observed in Hf0.5Zr0.5O2 nanopowders with the appearance of the ferroelectric-like polar regions in the orthorhombic phase of the nanoparticles, which agrees with the calculations performed in the framework of Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach and density functional theory.

Title: Orbital orders under magnetic fields in cubic PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$
Authors: Hitoko Okanoya, Kazumasa Hattori
Abstract: We study orbital orders in quadrupolar heavy-fermion compound PrIr$_2$Zn$_{20}$ under magnetic fields on the basis of the Landau theory. Assuming E$_g$ orbital (electric quadrupolar) orders in the cubic symmetry with the ordering wavenumber at the L points in the face-centered cubic lattice Brillouin zone as observed experimentally, we construct the Landau free energy and analyze it. We find that the unidentified high-temperature ordered phase under the magnetic field H ||[001] reported earlier can be interpreted as the consequence of the internal rotation in the orbital moments of f electrons at the Pr site. We discuss the phase diagram for various magnetic-field directions and also possible double-q quadrupolar orders in this system.

Title: Global becomes local: Efficient many-body dynamics for global master equations
Authors: Alexander Schnell
Abstract: This work makes progress on the issue of global vs. local master equations. Global master equations like the Redfield master equation (following from standard Born and Markov approximation) require a full diagonalization of the system Hamiltonian. This is especially challenging for interacting quantum many-body systems. We discuss a short-bath-correlation-time expansion in reciprocal (energy) space, leading to a series expansion of the jump operator, which avoids a diagonalization of the Hamiltonian. For a bath that is coupled locally to one site, this typically leads to an expansion of the global Redfield jump operator in terms of local operators. We additionally map the local Redfield master equation to a novel local Lindblad form, giving an equation which has the same conceptual advantages of traditional local Lindblad approaches, while being applicable in a much broader class of systems. Our ideas give rise to a non-heuristic foundation of local master equations, which can be combined with established many-body methods.

Title: Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times
Authors: Deepak Sah, Manoranjan P. Singh
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.

Title: The effects of disorder in superconducting materials on qubit coherence
Authors: Ran Gao, Feng Wu, Hantao Sun, Jianjun Chen, Hao Deng, Xizheng Ma, Xiaohe Miao, Zhijun Song, Xin Wan, Fei Wang, Tian Xia, Make Ying, Chao Zhang, Yaoyun Shi, Hui-Hai Zhao, Chunqing Deng
Abstract: Introducing disorderness in the superconducting materials has been considered promising to enhance the electromagnetic impedance and realize noise-resilient superconducting qubits. Despite a number of pioneering implementations, the understanding of the correlation between the material disorderness and the qubit coherence is still developing. Here, we demonstrate a systematic characterization of fluxonium qubits with the superinductors made from titanium-aluminum-nitride with varied disorderness. From qubit noise spectroscopy, the flux noise and the dielectric loss are extracted as a measure of the coherence properties. Our results reveal that the $1/f$ flux noise dominates the qubit decoherence around the flux-frustration point, strongly correlated with the material disorderness; while the dielectric loss remains low under a wide range of material properties. From the flux-noise amplitudes, the areal density ($\sigma$) of the phenomenological spin defects and material disorderness are found to be approximately correlated by $\sigma \propto \rho_{xx}^3$, or effectively $(k_F l)^{-3}$. This work has provided new insights on the origin of decoherence channels within superconductors, and could serve as a useful guideline for material design and optimization.

Title: Mining higher-order triadic interactions
Authors: Marta Niedostatek, Anthony Baptista, Jun Yamamoto, Jurgen Kurths, Ruben Sanchez Garcia, Ben MacArthur, Ginestra Bianconi
Abstract: Complex systems often involve higher-order interactions which require us to go beyond their description in terms of pairwise networks. Triadic interactions are a fundamental type of higher-order interaction that occurs when one node regulates the interaction between two other nodes. Triadic interactions are found in a large variety of biological systems, from neuron-glia interactions to gene-regulation and ecosystems. However, triadic interactions have so far been mostly neglected. In this article, we propose a theoretical model that demonstrates that triadic interactions can modulate the mutual information between the dynamical state of two linked nodes. Leveraging this result, we propose the Triadic Interaction Mining (TRIM) algorithm to mine triadic interactions from node metadata, and we apply this framework to gene expression data, finding new candidates for triadic interactions relevant for Acute Myeloid Leukemia. Our work reveals important aspects of higher-order triadic interactions that are often ignored, yet can transform our understanding of complex systems and be applied to a large variety of systems ranging from biology to the climate.

Title: Properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics
Authors: Siddharth Seetharaman, Chetanya Singh, Rejish Nath
Abstract: We analyze the properties of Krylov state complexity in qubit dynamics, considering a single qubit and a qubit pair. A geometrical picture of the Krylov complexity is discussed for the single-qubit case, whereas it becomes non-trivial for the two-qubit case. Considering the particular case of interacting Rydberg two-level atoms, we show that the Krylov basis obtained using an effective Hamiltonian minimizes the time-averaged spread complexity compared to that which is obtained from the original Hamiltonian. We further generalize the latter property to an arbitrary Hamiltonian in which the entire Hilbert space comprises of two subspaces provided a weak coupling between them.

Title: Center vortices and localized Dirac modes in the deconfined phase of (2+1)-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory
Authors: György Baranka, Dénes Berta, Matteo Giordano
Abstract: We study the deconfinement transition in (2+1)-dimensional lattice $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory both as a percolation transition of center vortices and as a localization transition for the low-lying Dirac modes. We study in detail the critical properties of the Anderson transition in the Dirac spectrum in the deconfined phase, showing that it is of BKT type; and the critical properties of the center-vortex percolation transition, showing that they differ from those of ordinary two-dimensional percolation. We then study the relation between localized modes and center vortices in the deconfined phase, identifying the simple center-vortex structures that mainly support the localized Dirac modes. As the system transitions to the confined phase, center vortices merge together into an infinite cluster, causing the low Dirac modes to delocalize.

Title: Temporal Bell inequalities in non-relativistic many-body physics
Authors: Andrea Tononi, Maciej Lewenstein
Abstract: Analyzing the spreading of information in many-body systems is crucial to understanding their quantum dynamics. At the most fundamental level, this task is accomplished by Bell inequalities, whose violation by quantum mechanics implies that information cannot always be stored locally. While Bell-like inequalities, such as the one of Clauser and Horne, envisage a situation in which two parties perform measurements on systems at different positions, one could formulate temporal inequalities, in which the two parties measure at different times. However, for causally-connected measurement events, these extensions are compatible with a local description, so that no intrinsically-quantum information spreading is involved in such temporal correlations. Here we show that a temporal Clauser-Horne inequality for two spins is violated for a nonzero time interval between the measurements if the two measured parties are connected by a spin chain. Since the chain constitutes the sole medium for the spreading of quantum information, it prevents the immediate vanishing of Bell correlations after the first measurement and it induces violation revivals. The dynamics we analyze shows that, as expected in a non-relativistic setup, the spreading of information is fundamentally limited by the Lieb-Robinson bound. New insights on many-body quantum dynamics could emerge through future applications of our temporal Bell inequality to more general systems.

Title: Complex symmetric, self-dual, and Ginibre random matrices: Analytical results for three classes of bulk and edge statistics
Authors: Gernot Akemann, Noah Aygün, Mario Kieburg, Patricia Päßler
Abstract: Recently, a conjecture about the local bulk statistics of complex eigenvalues has been made based on numerics. It claims that there are only three universality classes, which have all been observed in open chaotic quantum systems. Motivated by these new insights, we compute and compare the expectation values of $k$ pairs of complex conjugate characteristic polynomials in three ensembles of Gaussian non-Hermitian random matrices representative for the three classes: the well-known complex Ginibre ensemble, complex symmetric and complex self-dual matrices. In the Cartan classification scheme of non-Hermitian random matrices they are labelled as class A, AI$^†$ and AII$^†$, respectively. Using the technique of Grassmann variables, we derive explicit expressions for a single pair of expected characteristic polynomials for finite as well as infinite matrix dimension. For the latter we consider the global limit as well as zoom into the edge and the bulk of the spectrum, providing new analytical results for classes AI$^†$ and AII$^†$. For general $k$, we derive the effective Lagrangians corresponding to the non-linear $\sigma$-models in the respective physical systems. Interestingly, they agree for all three ensembles, while the corresponding Goldstone manifolds, over which one has to perform the remaining integrations, are different and equal the three classical compact groups in the bulk. In particular, our analytical results show that these three ensembles have indeed different local bulk and edge spectral statistics, corroborating the conjecture further.

Title: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics in action: effective field theory and holography
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Yanyan Bu, Xiyang Sun
Abstract: Chiral Anomalous Magnetohydrodynamics (CAMHD) provides a low-energy effective framework for describing chiral fluids in the presence of dynamical electromagnetic fields and axial anomaly. This theory finds applications across diverse physical systems, including heavy-ion collisions, the early universe, and Weyl/Dirac semimetals. Along with Schwinger-Keldysh (SK) effective theories, holographic models serve as a complementary tool to provide a systematic formulation of CAMHD that goes beyond the weak coupling regime. In this work, we explore holographic models with $U(1)_A \times U(1)$ symmetry, where the electromagnetic $U(1)$ field is rendered dynamical through mixed boundary conditions applied to the bulk gauge field and the axial anomaly is introduced via a Chern-Simons bulk term. Through a detailed holographic SK analysis, we demonstrate that the low-energy effective action derived from this model aligns precisely with the SK field theory proposed by Landry and Liu and, in fact, it generalizes it to scenarios with finite background axial field. This alignment not only validates the holographic model but also paves the way for its use in exploring unresolved aspects of CAMHD, such as the recently proposed chiral magnetic electric separation wave and nonlinear chiral instabilities.

Title: Measurement-induced Lévy flights of quantum information
Authors: Igor Poboiko, Marcin Szyniszewski, Christopher J. Turner, Igor V. Gornyi, Alexander D. Mirlin, Arijeet Pal
Abstract: We explore a model of free fermions in one dimension, subject to frustrated (non-commuting) local measurements across adjacent sites, which resolves the fermions into non-orthogonal orbitals, misaligned from the underlying lattice. For maximal misalignment, superdiffusive behavior emerges from the vanishing of the measurement-induced quasiparticle decay rate at one point in the Brillouin zone, which generates fractal-scaling entanglement entropy $S \propto \ell^{1/3}$ for a subsystem of length $\ell$. We derive an effective non-linear sigma model with long-range couplings responsible for Lévy flights in entanglement propagation, which we confirm with large-scale numerical simulations. When the misalignment is reduced, the entanglement exhibits, with increasing $\ell$, consecutive regimes of superdiffusive, $S\propto \ell^{1/3}$, diffusive, $S\propto \ln \ell$, and localized, $S = \rm{const}$, behavior. Our findings show how intricate fractal-scaling entanglement can be produced for local Hamiltonians and measurements.

Title: Transfer matrix approach to quantum systems subject to certain Lindblad evolution
Authors: Junaid Majeed Bhat, Marko Znidaric
Abstract: Solving for the time evolution of a many particle system whose dynamics is governed by Lindblad equation is hard. We extend the use of the transfer matrix approach to a class of Lindblad equations that admit a closed hierarchy of two point correlators. An example that we treat is the XX spin chain, i.e., free fermions, subject to the local on-site dephasing, but can be extended to other Hermitian dissipators, e.g., non-local dephasing. We find a simple expression of the Green's function in the Laplace domain. The method can be used to get analytical results in the thermodynamic limit, for instance, to get the evolution of the magnetization density and to explicitly see the crossover between ballistic and diffusive behavior, or to show that the correlations between operators at distance $l$ decay with time as $1/t^{\lceil l/2 \rceil+1/2}$. It also provides a fast numerical method to determine the evolution of the density with a complexity scaling with the system size more favorably than in previous methods, easily allowing one to study systems with $\sim 10^6$ spins.

Title: Applications of Statistical Field Theory in Deep Learning
Authors: Zohar Ringel, Noa Rubin, Edo Mor, Moritz Helias, Inbar Seroussi
Abstract: Deep learning algorithms have made incredible strides in the past decade, yet due to their complexity, the science of deep learning remains in its early stages. Being an experimentally driven field, it is natural to seek a theory of deep learning within the physics paradigm. As deep learning is largely about learning functions and distributions over functions, statistical field theory, a rich and versatile toolbox for tackling complex distributions over functions (fields) is an obvious choice of formalism. Research efforts carried out in the past few years have demonstrated the ability of field theory to provide useful insights on generalization, implicit bias, and feature learning effects. Here we provide a pedagogical review of this emerging line of research.

Title: High-entropy Advantage in Neural Networks' Generalizability
Authors: Entao Yang, Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Ge Zhang
Abstract: One of the central challenges in modern machine learning is understanding how neural networks generalize knowledge learned from training data to unseen test data. While numerous empirical techniques have been proposed to improve generalization, a theoretical understanding of the mechanism of generalization remains elusive. Here we introduce the concept of Boltzmann entropy into neural networks by re-conceptualizing such networks as hypothetical molecular systems where weights and biases are atomic coordinates, and the loss function is the potential energy. By employing molecular simulation algorithms, we compute entropy landscapes as functions of both training loss and test accuracy (or test loss), on networks with up to 1 million parameters, across four distinct machine learning tasks: arithmetic question, real-world tabular data, image recognition, and language modeling. Our results reveal the existence of high-entropy advantage, wherein high-entropy network states generally outperform those reached via conventional training techniques like stochastic gradient descent. This entropy advantage provides a thermodynamic explanation for neural network generalizability: the generalizable states occupy a larger part of the parameter space than its non-generalizable analog at low train loss. Furthermore, we find this advantage more pronounced in narrower neural networks, indicating a need for different training optimizers tailored to different sizes of networks.

Title: Infrared Phonon Thermoreflectance in Polar Dielectrics
Authors: William D. Hutchins, Saman Zare, Daniel Hirt, Elizabeth Golightly, Patrick E. Hopkins
Abstract: In this work, we investigate dielectric materials for thermoreflectance-based thermal sensing by extracting key optical parameters using temperature-dependent spectroscopic ellipsometry in the mid-infrared regime. Leveraging optical phonon resonances, we demonstrate that the thermoreflectance coefficients in polar dielectrics rival, and in some cases exceed by an order of magnitude, those observed in commonly used metals that are typically used as temperature transducers in thermoreflectance measurements. We introduce a transducer figure of merit (FOM) that combines pump absorption and probe reflectance modulation at different wavelengths. Our findings reveal that materials such as sapphire and aluminum nitride can outperform metals by up to two orders of magnitude. These results position dielectric materials as compelling candidates for next-generation thermal metrology, broadening the design space for optical thermometry, with strong implications for high-resolution thermal mapping and characterization of layered device structures based on phonon probing.

Title: Bloch phonon-polaritons with anomalous dispersion in polaritonic Fourier crystals
Authors: Sergey G. Menabde, Yongjun Lim, Alexey Y. Nikitin, Pablo Alonso Gonzalez, Jacob T. Heiden, Heerin Noh, Seungwoo Lee, Min Seok Jang
Abstract: The recently suggested concept of a polaritonic Fourier crystal (PFC) is based on a harmonically-corrugated mirror substrate for a thin pristine polaritonic crystal layer. The propagating polaritons in PFC experience a harmonic and mode-selective momentum modulation leading to a manifestation of Bloch modes with practically zero inter-mode scattering. PFC was first demonstrated for the hyperbolic phonon-polaritons in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) within its Type II Reststrahlen band (RB-II) where the in-plane components of the dielectric permittivity tensor are isotropic and negative, while the out-of-plane component is positive. By contrast, a Type I Reststrahlen band (RB-I) is characterized by negative out-of-plane and positive in-plane permittivity components, and consequently, the inversion of field symmetry of phonon-polaritons compared to RB-II. Behavior of such RB-I modes in a polaritonic crystal is yet to be explored. Here, we employ a biaxial crystal alpha-phase molybdenum trioxide ({\alpha}-MoO3) and near-field imaging to study polaritonic Bloch modes in a one-dimensional PFC within the RB-I where the mid-infrared phonon-polaritons in {\alpha}-MoO3 have anomalous dispersion and negative phase velocity. Surprisingly, we observe a manifestation of Bloch waves as a dispersionless near-field pattern across the first Brillouin zone, in contrast to RB-II case demonstrated with in-plane isotropic hBN. We attribute this difference to the opposite field symmetry of the lowest-order phonon-polariton mode in the two RBs, leading to a different momentum modulation regime in the polaritonic Fourier crystal. Our results reveal the importance of mode symmetry for polaritonic crystals in general and for the emerging field of Fourier crystals in particular, which promise new ways to manipulate the nanolight.

Title: Dynamics of localized states in the stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation
Authors: Mahdieh Ebrahimi, Barbara Drossel, Wolfram Just
Abstract: We reconsider the dynamics of localized states in the deterministic and stochastic discrete nonlinear Schrödinger equation. Localized initial conditions disperse if the strength of the nonlinear part drops below a threshold. Localized states are unstable in a noisy environment. As expected, an infinite temperature state emerges when multiplicative noise is applied, while additive noise yields unbounded dynamics since conservation of normalization is violated.
