Title: Dissolution kinetics of iron sulfide minerals in alkaline solutions
Authors: Zhanzhao Li, Christopher A. Gorski, Aaron Thompson, Jeffrey R. Shallenberger, Gopakumar Kaladharan, Aleksandra Radlińska
Abstract: Deleterious aggregate reactions induced by iron sulfide minerals, especially pyrrhotite and pyrite, have devastated concrete structures across many global regions. While these minerals have been extensively studied under acidic conditions, their behavior in alkaline environments, such as concrete, remains poorly understood. This study investigates the kinetics and mechanisms of iron sulfide dissolution at high pH (13$\unicode{x2013}$14). Results revealed that pyrrhotite dissolves orders of magnitude more rapidly than pyrite, with dissolution rates increasing with both pH and temperature. The type of alkali (potassium or sodium) in the solution was not found to affect the dissolution behavior. Kinetic modeling and experimental characterization indicated that the dissolution kinetics of pyrrhotite is controlled by a combination of chemical reactions (oxidation of iron and sulfur species) and diffusion (through an Fe(III)-(oxy)hydroxide layer). These findings provide practical insights into controlling dissolution and mitigating iron sulfide-induced damage in concrete.

Title: Many-body effects of two-level systems in superconducting qubits
Authors: Joshuah T. Heath, Alexander C. Tyner, Thue Christian Thann, Vincent P. Michal, Peter Krogstrup, Mark Kamper Svendsen, Alexander V. Balatsky
Abstract: Superconducting qubits are often adversely affected by two-level systems (TLSs) within the Josephson junction, which contribute to decoherence and subsequently limit the performance of the qubit. By treating the TLS as a soft (i.e., low-frequency) bosonic mode localized in real space, we find that a single TLS in either the amorphous oxide surface or the superconducting bulk may result in a localized "hot spot" of amplified Josephson energy. Such amplification is shown to have a non-negligible effect on the $T_1$ time of certain superconducting qubits, regardless of whether or not the TLS is on resonance with the qubit frequency. With this study, we identify sources of decoherence unique to the superconducting element of superconducting quantum devices.

Title: Elastic Response and Instabilities of Anomalous Hall Crystals
Authors: Félix Desrochers, Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Joe Huxford, Adarsh S. Patri, T. Senthil, Yong Baek Kim
Abstract: Anomalous Hall crystals (AHCs) are exotic phases of matter that simultaneously break continuous translation symmetry and exhibit the quantum anomalous Hall effect. AHCs have recently been proposed as an explanation for the observation of an integer quantum anomalous Hall phase in a multilayer graphene system. Despite intense theoretical and experimental interest, little is known about the mechanical properties of AHCs. We study the elastic properties of AHCs, first by utilizing a continuum model with uniform Berry curvature. In contrast to Wigner crystals, we find that the stiffness of the AHC weakens and eventually vanishes as electronic interactions are increased. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the triangular lattice AHC arising in an experimentally relevant parameter regime of a realistic model of rhombohedral pentalayer graphene is unstable, emphasizing the importance of understanding the mechanical properties of AHCs for interpreting experiments.

Title: Circuits as a simple platform for the emergence of hydrodynamics in deterministic chaotic many-body systems
Authors: Sun Woo P. Kim, Friedrich Hübner, Juan P. Garrahan, Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: The emergence of hydrodynamics is one of the deepest phenomena in many-body systems. Arguably, the hydrodynamic equations are also the most important tools for predicting large-scale behaviour. Understanding how such equations emerge from microscopic deterministic dynamics is a century-old problem, despite recent progress in fine-tuned integrable systems. Due to the universality of hydrodynamics, the specific microscopic implementation should not matter. Here, we show that classical deterministic circuits provide a minimal, exact, and efficient platform that admits non-trivial hydrodynamic behaviour for deterministic but chaotic systems. By developing new techniques and focusing on 1D circuits as a proof of concept, we obtain the characteristic dynamics, including relaxation to Gibbs states, exact Euler equations, shocks, diffusion, and exact KPZ super-diffusion. Our methods can be easily generalised to higher dimensions or quantum circuits.

Title: A generalized framework for viscous and non-viscous damping models
Authors: Soumya Kanti Ganguly, Indrajit Mukherjee
Abstract: The inadequacy of the classical viscous damping model in capturing dissipation across a wide range of applications has led to the development of non-viscous damping models. While non-viscous models describe damping force satisfactorily, they offer limited physical insight. Leveraging an existing framework, well known to the physics community, this article provides fresh insights into the framework of non viscous damping for engineers. For this purpose, we revisit the motion of a particle coupled to a bath of harmonic oscillators at a finite temperature. We obtain a general expression for non-viscous damping in terms of a general memory kernel function. For specific choices of the kernel function, we derive exact expressions for a host of non-viscous damping models including the classical viscous damping as a special case.

Title: Recombination velocities at grain boundaries in solar-cell absorbers -- revisited
Authors: Daniel Abou-Ras, Matthias Maiberg
Abstract: The present work revisits the recombination velocities ($s_{\mathrm{GB}}$) of minority-charge carriers determined at grain boundaries in polycrystalline absorber materials for solar cells. The equations describing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ as well as the barriers for electrons and holes were derived. It is shown that for given net-doping density and absolute temperature, the experimentally determined recombination velocity of a specific grain boundary depends only on the excess-charge density at this planar defect as well as on the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$ describing the nonradiative recombination. Value ranges for these two quantities can be determined for any measured $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ value. When analyzing $s_{\mathrm{GB}}$ datasets acquired on various (Ag,Cu)(In,Ga)Se$_2$ and microcrystalline Si absorbers, it is apparent that both, the excess-charge density and the prefactor $s_{\mathrm{GB,0}}$, remain within about the same orders of magnitude for all grain boundaries analyzed in a specific absorber. The broad range of the recombination velocities over several orders magnitude indicate upward as well as downward band bending, and the band-bending values are on the order of several $\pm$10 meV for all materials analyzed.

Title: Fluence dependent delay of Ni in an FeNi alloy supports an exchange based origin
Authors: Somnath Jana, Ronny Knut, Puloma Singh, Kelvin Yao, Christian Tzschaschel, Johanna Richter, Daniel Schick, Denny Sommer, Dieter Engel, Olof Karis, Clemens von Korff Schmising, Stefan Eisebitt
Abstract: The delayed demagnetization in Ni relative to Fe in the ultrafast demagnetization studies in FeNi alloy has led to two competing theoretical explanations: The Inhomogeneous Magnon Generation (IMG) and the Optically Induced Spin Transfer (OISTR) model. The IMG attributes the delay to the preferential magnon generation at the Fe sites and its subsequent propagation to Ni, while OISTR proposes direct spin transfer from Ni to Fe. In this study, we employ element-resolved extreme ultraviolet spectroscopy to investigate the effect of excitation strength on this delay, aiming to resolve the controversy. The data indicate a significant reduction in the delay with increasing fluence, which is inconsistent with the theoretical predictions of OISTR. These findings, in conjunction with the observation of a saturation of Fe demagnetization at the onset of Ni demagnetization, indicate that a spin-wave instability within the IMG framework may provide a potential explanation for the experimental results.

Title: Ferroelectricity of Wurtzite Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N Heterovalent Alloys

Abstract: Thin films of aluminum hafnium nitride (Al$_{1-x}$Hf$_{x}$N) were synthesized via reactive magnetron sputtering for Hf contents up to $x$ = 0.13. X-ray diffraction showed a single $c$-axis oriented wurtzite phase for all films. Hard X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy demonstrated homogeneous Al:Hf distribution through the thin films and confirmed their insulating character. A collection of complementary tests showed unambiguous polarization inversion, and thus ferroelectricity in multiple samples. Current density vs. electric field hysteresis measurements showed distinct ferroelectric switching current peaks, the piezoelectric coefficient d$_{33,f,meas}$ measured using a double beam laser interferometer (DBLI) showed a reversal in sign with similar magnitude, and anisotropic wet etching confirmed field-induced polarization inversion. This demonstrates the possibility of using tetravalent--and not just trivalent--alloying elements to enable ferroelectricity in AlN-based thin films, highlighting the compositional flexibility of ferroelectricity in wurtzites and greatly expanding the chemistries that can be considered for future devices.

Title: Thermodynamic inference in molecular motors: a Martingale approach
Authors: Adrián Nadal-Rosa, Gonzalo Manzano
Abstract: Molecular motors are in charge of almost every process in the life cycle of cells, such as protein synthesis, DNA replication, and cell locomotion, hence being of crucial importance for understanding the cellular dynamics. However, given their size scales on the order of nanometers, direct measurements are rather challenging, and the information that can be extracted from them is limited. In this work, we propose strategies based on martingale theory in stochastic thermodynamics to infer thermodynamic properties of molecular motors using a limited amount of available information. In particular, we use two recent theoretical results valid for systems arbitrary far of equilibrium: the integral fluctuation theorem (IFT) at stopping times, and a family of bounds to the maximal excursions of entropy production. The potential of these strategies is illustrated with a simple model for the F1-ATPase rotary molecular motor, where our approach is able to estimate several quantities determining the thermodynamics of the motor, such as the rotational work of the motor performed against an externally applied force, or the effective environmental temperature.

Title: Evidence of strong electron correlation effects and magnetic topological excitation in low carbon steel
Authors: P. C. Mahato, Suprotim Saha, D. Banik, K. Mondal, Shyam Kumar Choudhary, Ashish Garg, S. S. Banerjee
Abstract: Present study explores how thermal treatments and strain affect the magnetic response of two plain-carbon steels, with 0.05 wt% and 0.7 wt% carbon. Electron-backscattered diffraction and high-frequency magnetic susceptibility ($\chi$) measurements in 0.05%C steel reveal that annealing increases $\chi$ by enlarging grains, while quenching reduces it by decreasing grain size. We also study the 0.7%C steel, to delineate effects of quench-induced strain and possible carbon-rich (Fe$_3$C) phase admixture in 0.05%C steel which could affect its magnetic response. In 0.7%C steel, uniaxial tensile strain enhances $\chi$ via altered magnetic anisotropy, avoiding the reduction seen in quenched 0.05%C steel. Micro-magnetic modelling and magnetic force microscopy identify magnetic topological structures (MTS) in 0.05%C steel, especially with quenching. Low-temperature transport measurement suggests strong electron correlations drive Kondo effect in 0.05%C steel and MTS is an emergent feature of interplay with local strain. Thus, steel exhibits strong electron correlations and novel magnetic excitations, making it a promising quantum material platform for developing new device applications.

Title: Power-law banded random matrix ensemble as a model for quantum many-body Hamiltonians
Authors: Wouter Buijsman, Masudul Haque, Ivan M. Khaymovich
Abstract: Hamiltonians of one-dimensional, disordered single-particle systems with long-range hopping terms can naturally be modeled by power-law banded random matrices. In this picture, the phase diagram of a power-law banded random matrix ensemble show ergodic, weakly ergodic, multifractal, and localized phases. Motivated by recent developments on ergodicity breaking and localization in interacting quantum many-body systems, we explore many-body interpretations of the power-law banded random matrix ensemble. We discuss a number of ways to label the basis vectors with many-body configurations, and compare the physical properties of the resulting Hamiltonians. We characterize the scaling of the many-body eigenstate entanglement entropy with system size for the different labeling schemes and in each of the phases. Using a scaling analysis on the full sets of eigenstates, we subsequently provide a quantitative picture of the boundary between the different types of scaling behavior that we observe for the spectral-bulk and spectral-edge eigenstates.

Title: Orbital splitter effect and spatial resolution of current-induced orbital accumulation
Authors: Niels Henrik Aase, Erik Wegner Hodt, Karl Bergson Hallberg, Asle Sudbø, Jacob Linder
Abstract: The emergence of an orbital angular momentum (OAM) response to a charge current holds promise for technological applications, allowing electrical control of magnetization dynamics. Often, the OAM current is invoked in explaining experimental results for very large orbital transport effects, but this is conceptually challenging as the OAM current is not a conserved quantity. Instead of utilizing the orbital conductivity associated with the non-conserved OAM current, we here use non-equilibrium Green's functions to directly image the OAM density in real space under an applied electric current bias. We find strong spatial variations in OAM density, with the lattice acting as a source and sink of OAM. Moreover, we show that the OAM response depends sensitively on the angle between the charge current and the crystal axis. This enables the generation of an orbital Hall effect in one current direction and solely a longitudinal response in another. We refer to this as an orbital splitter effect, analogous to the spin splitter effect in altermagnets.

Title: Topography of Fermi Arcs in t-PtBi$_2$ Using High Resolution Angle-resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy
Authors: Evan O'Leary, Zhuoqi Li, Lin-Lin Wang, Benjamin Schrunk, Andrew Eaton, Paul C. Canfield, Adam Kaminski
Abstract: We use high resolution angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and density functional theory (DFT) to investigate the electronic structure of trigonal phase ${\rm PtBi_2}$ (t-${\rm PtBi_2}$), a proposed Weyl semimetal that is expected to exhibit topological Fermi Arcs. Our ARPES data elucidates the topography of these objects and confirms their Fermi arc character. The arcs are formed by surface bands that have fairly flat bottom located very close to the chemical potential $\sim$ 6-8 meV, before they merge with bulk bands at higher binding energy. Comparison of the ARPES data with DFT calculations shows good agreement about their location and topography. Data acquired at low temperatures does not show any signatures of superconductivity down to 3 K in terms of expected changes in dispersion due to formation of Bogoliubov quasiparticles or superconducting gap in form of reliable shifts of peaks in energy distribution curves.

Title: Real-time simulation enabled navigation control of magnetic soft continuum robots in confined lumens
Authors: Dezhong Tong, Zhuonan Hao, Jiyu Li, Boxi Sun, Mingchao Liu, Liu Wang, Weicheng Huang
Abstract: Magnetic soft continuum robots (MSCRs) have emerged as a promising technology for minimally invasive interventions, offering enhanced dexterity and remote-controlled navigation in confined lumens. Unlike conventional guidewires with pre-shaped tips, MSCRs feature a magnetic tip that actively bends under applied magnetic fields. Despite extensive studies in modeling and simulation, achieving real-time navigation control of MSCRs in confined lumens remains a significant challenge. The primary reasons are due to robot-lumen contact interactions and computational limitations in modeling MSCR nonlinear behavior under magnetic actuation. Existing approaches, such as Finite Element Method (FEM) simulations and energy-minimization techniques, suffer from high computational costs and oversimplified contact interactions, making them impractical for real-world applications. In this work, we develop a real-time simulation and navigation control framework that integrates hard-magnetic elastic rod theory, formulated within the Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) framework, with an order-reduced contact handling strategy. Our approach captures large deformations and complex interactions while maintaining computational efficiency. Next, the navigation control problem is formulated as an inverse design task, where optimal magnetic fields are computed in real time by minimizing the constrained forces and enhancing navigation accuracy. We validate the proposed framework through comprehensive numerical simulations and experimental studies, demonstrating its robustness, efficiency, and accuracy. The results show that our method significantly reduces computational costs while maintaining high-fidelity modeling, making it feasible for real-time deployment in clinical settings.

Title: Towards Excitations and Dynamical Quantities in Correlated Lattices with Density Matrix Embedding Theory
Authors: Shuoxue Li, Chenghan Li, Huanchen Zhai, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: Density matrix embedding theory (DMET) provides a framework to describe ground-state expectation values in strongly correlated systems, but its extension to dynamical quantities is still an open problem. We demonstrate one route to obtaining excitations and dynamical spectral functions by using the techniques of DMET to approximate the matrix elements that arise in a single-mode inspired excitation ansatz. We demonstrate this approach in the 1D Hubbard model, comparing the neutral excitations, single-particle density of states, charge, and spin dynamical structure factors to benchmarks from the Bethe ansatz and density matrix renormalization group. Our work highlights the potential of these ideas in building computationally efficient approaches for dynamical quantities.

Title: Néel vector rotation driven by spin-orbit torque in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo
Authors: Tetsuma Mandokoro, Yoichi Shiota, Tomoya Ito, Hiroki Matsumoto, Hideki Narita, Ryusuke Hisatomi, Shutaro Karube, Teruo Ono
Abstract: Spin superfluidity, a phenomenon enabling low dissipative spin transport analogous to superfluidity in liquid helium and superconductivity in electronic systems, has remained a theoretical concept. To realize the spin superfluidity in an antiferromagnet, it is necessary to excite a Néel vector rotation within the magnetic easy-plane, which has been elusive so far. In this study, we demonstrated spin-orbit torque-driven Néel vector rotation in amorphous ferrimagnetic GdCo. A pseudo-magnetic easy-plane is formed in a spin-flop state under an external magnetic field at the vicinity of the magnetization compensation temperature, and we observed stochastic binary switching in the anomalous Hall resistance, directly attributed to Néel vector rotation. Furthermore, homodyne detection confirmed rotation frequencies in the GHz range as expected from atomic spin simulations, providing evidence of dynamic Néel vector behavior. These findings represent a crucial advance towards the realization of spin superfluidity.

Title: Modeling and computation of the effective elastic behavior of parallelogram origami metamaterials
Authors: Hu Xu, Frederic Marazzato, Paul Plucinsky
Abstract: Origami metamaterials made of repeating unit cells of parallelogram panels joined at folds dramatically change their shape through a collective motion of their cells. Here we develop an effective elastic model and numerical method to study the large deformation response of these metamaterials under a broad class of loads. The model builds on an effective plate theory derived in our prior work [64]. The theory captures the overall shape change of all slightly stressed parallelogram origami deformations through nonlinear geometric compatibility constraints that couple the origami's (cell averaged) effective deformation to an auxiliary angle field quantifying its cell-by-cell actuation. It also assigns to each such origami deformation a plate energy associated to these effective fields. Seeking a constitutive model that is faithful to the theory but also practical to simulate, we relax the geometric constraints via corresponding elastic energy penalties; we also simplify the plate energy density to embrace its essential character as a regularization to the geometric penalties. The resulting model for parallelogram origami is a generalized elastic continuum that is nonlinear in the effective deformation gradient and angle field and regularized by high-order gradients thereof. We provide a finite element formulation of this model using the $C^0$ interior penalty method to handle second gradients of deformation, and implement it using the open source computing platform Firedrake. We end by using the model and numerical method to study two canonical parallelogram origami patterns, in Miura and Eggbox origami, under a variety of loading conditions.

Title: Automated Imaging of the Annihilation of a Transverse Domain Wall in Patterned Magnetic Thin Films
Authors: Charudatta Phatak, John Fullerton, Hanu Arava
Abstract: Imaging the magnetic domain wall behavior in patterned thin films under external stimuli can enable understanding the underlying energy landscape as well as the role of local microstructure and defects. We present an automated workflow for in-situ Lorentz transmission electron microscopy to image magnetic domain walls at the nanometer length scale and at a time resolution in the sub-millisecond regime - the latter of which is limited by the speed of the available camera. Our workflow is modular and can be broadly applied to various types of in-situ experiments, taking us a step closer to the future of autonomous imaging of nanomagnetic films with electron microscopy. Using our workflow, we show the transformation of a transverse domain wall with sub-millisecond time resolution under the application of an in-situ transverse magnetic field, a study of whose dynamics are essential in the design of future domain wall mediated spintronic device applications.

Title: Collective mode spectroscopy in time-reversal symmetry breaking superconductors
Authors: Silvia Neri, Walter Metzner, Dirk Manske
Abstract: Time-reversal symmetry breaking (TRSB) superconductors show a rich collective mode spectrum. In general, collective excitations in superconductors can provide crucial information on the symmetry of the broken phase, in particular, serving as a fingerprint for determining the groundstate gap symmetry. In this work, we consider several even parity two-dimensional TRSB superconductors characterized by an order parameter of the form $\Delta = \Delta_1 + i\Delta_2$. We provide a classification scheme of the collective excitations in the above systems as a function of the ratio between the components $\Delta_1/\Delta_2$. In order to excite the modes in the systems we have adopted two different probes: a quench of the condensate symmetry and a finite momentum transfer induced by an external electric field. Both methods allow us to excite and characterize the different modes in the spectra. To further interpret the results of the numerical calculations we provide a Ginzburg-Landau analysis and we construct a dynamical theory, deriving the linearized equations of motion in the pseudospin formalism. Our results could help distinguish between different order parameters symmetries of a TRSB superconducting condensate and estimate the magnitude of its different components.

Title: Deciphering the Scattering of Mechanically Driven Polymers using Deep Learning
Authors: Lijie Ding, Chi-Huan Tung, Bobby G. Sumpter, Wei-Ren Chen, Changwoo Do
Abstract: We present a deep learning approach for analyzing two-dimensional scattering data of semiflexible polymers under external forces. In our framework, scattering functions are compressed into a three-dimensional latent space using a Variational Autoencoder (VAE), and two converter networks establish a bidirectional mapping between the polymer parameters (bending modulus, stretching force, and steady shear) and the scattering functions. The training data are generated using off-lattice Monte Carlo simulations to avoid the orientational bias inherent in lattice models, ensuring robust sampling of polymer conformations. The feasibility of this bidirectional mapping is demonstrated by the organized distribution of polymer parameters in the latent space. By integrating the converter networks with the VAE, we obtain a generator that produces scattering functions from given polymer parameters and an inferrer that directly extracts polymer parameters from scattering data. While the generator can be utilized in a traditional least-squares fitting procedure, the inferrer produces comparable results in a single pass and operates three orders of magnitude faster. This approach offers a scalable, automated tool for polymer scattering analysis and provides a promising foundation for extending the method to other scattering models, experimental validation, and the study of time-dependent scattering data.

Abstract: Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3/La0.8Sr0.2MnO3/Ba0.85Ca0.15Zr0.1Ti0.9O3 (BCZT/LSMO/BCZT) sandwich films were elaborated using the sol-gel spin coating process. The dielectric properties displayed excellent thermal stability with the temperature coefficient of capacitance, TCC, remaining within 10% between -50 C and 300 C. The high energy storage density, Wrec, of 11.8 J/cm3 observed in this sandwich films, is nearly twice as high as that of the BCZT films, with an efficiency, n, of 77% under a weak electric field of 800 kV/cm. Furthermore, the stability of Wrec and n was observed along the studied temperature interval making them promising candidates for high-temperature energy storage capacitors.

Title: Comment on "Interferometric single-shot parity measurement in InAs-Al hybrid devices", Microsoft Quantum, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025)
Authors: Henry F. Legg
Abstract: We consider the 'parity readout' of a (topological) superconductor claimed in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025). A prerequisite for this claim is the existence of a superconducting gap in the nanowire device. However, to determine the presence of a gap, Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) relied on the so-called topological gap protocol (TGP). Here, we show that the TGP can report the regions where the 'parity readout' occurred as either gapped or gapless, depending on data parameters such as magnetic field range and cutter pair (junction transparency). Compounding these issues are inaccuracies in the presented TGP outcomes, which limited investigation of reproducibility. Since these inconsistent outcomes demonstrate that the TGP is not a reliable diagnostic tool for the presence of a superconducting gap, we instead investigate the conductance data for the studied regions -- data that were not presented in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025), but are in the public data repository. These conductance data show that the regions where 'parity readout' occurred are in fact highly disordered and present no clear gap in the nanowire, i.e., the underlying conductance data show that these regions are indeed gapless. That these regions are gapless contradicts the claim that the reported measurements are of the parity of a superconducting nanowire, let alone the parity of a topological superconducting nanowire. Taken together, these issues mean that the core findings in Nature 638, 651-655 (2025) are not reliable and should be revisited.

Title: Copper Vapor Catalyzing Role in the Growth of Graphene
Authors: Yuan Chang, Shiji Li, Tianyu He, Hongsheng Liu, Junfeng Gao
Abstract: Cu is most used substrate to grow monolayer graphene under a temperature near melting point. In this study, we elaborated a remarkable amount of Cu clusters were continuously evaporated during the graphene growth, resulting into the vapor pressure comparable with the CH4. Importantly, the decomposition barrier of CH4 on Cu clusters is similar or even lower than on Cu surface. CuCH4 serves as the primary active cluster in complex intermediates, exhibiting a growth-promoting effect. Particularly after the first graphene layer coverage, it may emerge as a dominant catalytic factor for multilayer growth by supplying critical growth species. Through controlled seed incorporation, this mechanism is expected to enable large-area controllable growth of bilayer and multilayer graphene structures.

Title: Excitonic bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructure metasurfaces
Authors: Polina Pantyukhina, Andrey Bogdanov, Kirill Koshelev
Abstract: We investigate the formation of excitonic quasi-bound states in the continuum in van der Waals heterostructures composed of two-dimensional excitonic layers and resonant dielectric metasurfaces. We begin our analysis with a simplified planar heterostructure slab model containing a vdW layer. We develop a theoretical framework based on the slab's Green function to describe the weak coupling between excitons and quasi-normal electromagnetic modes. We show that the exciton Purcell factor can be significantly suppressed when the exciton frequency matches a Fabry-Pérot mode and the vdW layer is positioned at the nodes of the mode's electric field. In this case, the suppression reaches its fundamental limit, which is defined exclusively by slab's permittivity. In heterostructure metasurfaces, a more substantial suppression can be achieved due to multiple interferences between Fabry-Pérot modes and guided-mode resonances with high quality factors. Numerical simulations confirm that the exciton radiative lifetime can be extended by over two orders of magnitude, demonstrating the formation of excitonic quasi-BICs and their potential for advancing quantum optics and information processing.

Title: Extreme resilience and dissipation in heterogeneous disordered materials
Authors: Jehoon Moon, Gisoo Lee, Jaehee Lee, Hansohl Cho
Abstract: Long range order and symmetry in heterogeneous materials architected on crystal lattices lead to elastic and inelastic anisotropies and thus limit mechanical functionalities in particular crystallographic directions. Here, we present a facile approach for designing heterogeneous disordered materials that exhibit nearly isotropic mechanical resilience and energy dissipation capabilities. We demonstrate, through experiments and numerical simulations on 3D-printed prototypes, that near-complete isotropy can be attained in the proposed heterogeneous materials with a small, finite number of random spatial points. We also show that adding connectivity between random subdomains leads to much enhanced elastic stiffness, plastic strength, energy dissipation, shape recovery, structural stability and reusability in our new heterogeneous materials. Overall, our study opens avenues for the rational design of a new class of heterogeneous materials with isotropic mechanical functionalities for which the engineered disorder throughout the subdomains plays a crucial role.

Title: Dense suspensions as trainable rheological metafluids
Authors: Hojin Kim, Samantha M. Livermore, Stuart J. Rowan, Heinrich M. Jaeger
Abstract: Memory-forming properties introduce a new paradigm to the design of adaptive materials. In dense suspensions, an adaptive response is enabled by non-Newtonian rheology; however, typical suspensions have little memory, which implies rapid cessation of any adapted behavior. Here we show how multiple adaptive responses can be achieved by designing suspensions where different stress levels trigger different memories. This is enabled by the interplay of interactions based on frictional contact and dynamic chemical bridging. These two interactions lead to novel rheology with several well-delineated shear thinning and thickening regimes, which enable stress-activated memories associated with opposite time-dependent trends. As a result, in response to different stress levels, the suspension can evolve by either softening or stiffening and is trainable, exhibiting targeted viscosity and energy dissipation with repeated low-velocity impact. Such behavior, usually associated with mechanical metamaterials, suggests that dense suspensions with multiple memories can be viewed as trainable rheological metafluids.

Title: Intrinsic low-temperature magnetic properties on the ultra-clean UTe$_2$ with $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1 K revealed by $^{125}$Te NMR

Abstract: To investigate the intrinsic magnetic properties of UTe$_2$, we performed $^{125}$Te-NMR measurements on the ultra-clean single-crystalline UTe$_2$ with superconducting transition temperature $T_{\rm c}$ = 2.1~K and compared the results with those of the $T_{\rm c}$ = 1.6~K sample. The broadening of the linewidth of the NMR spectrum in the $a$-axis magnetic field and the low-temperature magnetic fluctuations observed in the 1.6~K sample are suppressed in the ultra-clean sample, indicating that such magnetic properties originate from a tiny amount of U deficiency. The present results suggest that the magnetic properties in UTe$_2$ are sensitive to the U deficiency. We also observed a peculiar angular dependence of the NMR quantities due to large magnetic anisotropy with the $a$-axis as the magnetic easy axis.

Title: Nonequilibrium mean-field approach for quantum transport with off-diagonal disorder
Authors: Rongjie Cui, Zelei Zhang, Qi Wei, Yu Zhang, Youqi Ke
Abstract: For the nanoscale structures, disorder scattering plays a vital role in the carriers' transport, including electrons and high-frequency phonons. The capability for effectively treating the disorders, including both diagonal and off-diagonal disorders, is indispensable for quantum transport simulation of realistic device materials. In this work, we report a self-consistent nonequilibrium mean-field quantum transport approach, by combining the auxiliary coherent potential approximation (ACPA) and non-equilibrium Green's function method, for calculating the phonon transport through disordered material structures with the force-constant disorders (including the Anderson-type disorder). The nonequilibrium vertex correction (NVC) is derived in an extended local degree of freedom to account for both the multiple disorder scattering by force-constant disorder and the nonequilibrium quantum statistics. We have tested ACPA-NVC method with the fluctuation-dissipation theorem at the equilibrium and obtained very good agreement with supercell calculations for the phonon transmission. To demonstrate the applicability, we apply ACPA-NVC to calculate the thermal conductance for the disordered Ni/Pt interface, and important effects of force-constant disorder are revealed. ACPA-NVC method provides an effective quantum transport approach for simulating disordered nanoscale devices, and the generalization to simulate disordered nanoelectronic device is straightforward.

Title: Moiré-Driven Interfacial Thermal Transport in Twisted Transition Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Wenwu Jiang, Ting Liang, Hekai Bu, Jianbin Xu, Wengen Ouyang
Abstract: Cross-plane thermal conductivity in homogeneous transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) exhibits a strong dependence on twist angle, originating from atomic reconstruction within moiré superlattices. This reconstruction redistributes interlayer stacking modes, reducing high-efficiency thermal transport regions and softening the transverse acoustic phonon modes as the twist angle increases. We propose a general theoretical expression to capture this behavior, validated against non-equilibrium molecular dynamics simulations across both homo- and heterogeneous twisted TMDs structures, as well as homogeneous twisted graphene and hexagonal boron nitride stacks. Our model demonstrates that the interfacial thermal conductance (ITC) scales with the twist angle ($\theta$) as $\ln{\left(\text{ITC}\right)} \propto e^{-\sqrt{\theta}}$. This mechanism, likely universal in van der Waals layered materials, highlights the potential of twist engineering for controlling interfacial thermal transport, offering new avenues for thermal management in 2D materials.

Title: Anisotropic Hybridization Dynamics in the Quasi-One-Dimensional Kondo Lattice CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ Revealed by Ultrafast Optical Spectroscopy
Authors: Ba-Lei Tan, Chen Zhang, Qi-Yi Wu, Guo-Hao Dong, Hao Liu, Bo Chen, Jiao-Jiao Song, Xin-Yi Tian, Ying Zhou, Hai-Yun Liu, Yu-Xia Duan, You-Guo Shi, Jian-Qiao Meng
Abstract: We investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$ using optical pump-probe spectroscopy. Time-resolved pump-probe reflectivity measurements reveal a strong anisotropy in the photoinduced response, which is a direct consequence of the material's unique electronic structure. The temperature dependence of the relaxation dynamics provides evidence for the formation of two distinct hybridization gaps that appear at different temperatures in the heavy fermion state. A direct gap of 2$\Delta_{dir}$ $\approx$ 50 meV that persists up to $T^†$ $\approx$ 90 K, well above the coherence temperature $T^*$ $\approx$ 20 K. We attribute this higher-temperature gap to the hybridization fluctuations. An indirect gap of 2$\Delta_{ind}$ $\approx$ 10 meV opens closer to $T^*$, signifying the development of long-range coherence in the heavy fermion state. Furthermore, we find that the hybridization gap can be suppressed with increasing pump fluence, indicating a delicate interplay between photoexcitation and the coherent heavy fermion state. Our results provide insights into the interplay of Kondo physics and low dimensionality in CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, and establish ultrafast optical spectroscopy as a sensitive probe of anisotropic hybridization in heavy fermion materials.

Title: Dislocation correlations in GaN epitaxial films revealed by EBSD and XRD
Authors: Vladimir M. Kaganer, Domenik Spallek, Philipp John, Oliver Brandt, Jonas Lähnemann
Abstract: Correlations between dislocations in crystals reduce the elastic energy via screening of the strain by the surrounding dislocations. We study the correlations of threading dislocations in GaN epitaxial films with dislocation densities of 5x10^8 cm^-2 and 1.8x10^10 cm^-2 by X-ray diffraction (XRD) in reciprocal space and by high-resolution electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD) in real space, where the strain is derived from a cross-correlation analysis of the Kikuchi patterns. The measured XRD curves and EBSD strain and rotation maps are compared with Monte Carlo simulations within one and the same model for the dislocation distributions. The screening of the dislocation strains is provided by creating pairs of dislocations with opposite Burgers vectors, with the mean distance between dislocations in a pair equal to the screening distance. The pairs overlap and cannot be distinguished as separate dipoles. The EBSD-measured autocorrelation functions of the strain and rotation components follow the expected logarithmic law for distances smaller than the screening distances and become zero for larger distances, which is confirmed by the Monte Carlo simulations. Screening distances of 2 \textmu m and 0.3 \textmu m are obtained for the samples with low and high dislocation densities, respectively. The dislocation strain is thus screened by only 4 neighboring dislocations. High-resolution EBSD allows for a more precise determination of the screening distances than from fits of the XRD curves. In addition, an anisotropic resolution of the EBSD measurements is observed and quantified.

Title: Nanoscale spin ordering and spin screening effects in tunnel ferromagnetic Josephson junctions

Abstract: Magnetic Josephson junctions (MJJs) have emerged as a prominent playground to explore the interplay between superconductivity and ferromagnetism. A series of fascinating experiments have revealed striking phenomena at the Superconductor/Ferromagnet (S/F) interface, pointing to tunable phase transitions and to the generation of unconventional spin-triplet correlations. Here, we show that the Josephson effect, being sensitive to phase space variation on the nanoscale, allows a direct observation of the spin polarization of the S/F interface. By measuring the temperature dependence of the Josephson magnetic field patterns of tunnel MJJs with strong and thin F-layer, we demonstrate an induced nanoscale spin order in S along the superconducting coherence length at S/F interface, i.e., the inverse proximity effect, with the first evidence of full spin screening at very low temperatures, as expected by the theory. A comprehensive phase diagram for spin nanoscale ordering regimes at S/F interfaces in MJJs has been derived in terms of the magnetic moment induced in the S-layer. Our findings contribute to drive the design and the tailoring of S/F interfaces also in view of potential applications in quantum computing.

Title: Ultrafast Photoexcitation of Semiconducting Photocathode Materials
Authors: Hilde Bellersen, Michele Guerrini, Caterina Cocchi
Abstract: Cs-based semiconductors like $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ are currently used as photocathodes in particle accelerators. Their performance as electron sources critically depends on their interaction with intense laser sources. In this work, we investigate from first principles the time-dependent response of $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ to ultrafast pulses of varying intensities, ranging from $1~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ to $1~\mathrm{PW/cm^2}$. Nonlinear effects, including high harmonic generation, emerge starting from $100~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ in $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $200~\mathrm{GW/cm^2}$ in $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$. Above these intensities, the numbers of absorbed photons and excited electrons saturate due to the depletion of one-photon absorption channels, with renewed increases beyond $1~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $5~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$ for $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$ where multi-photon absorption appears. Finally, the analysis of the occupation density in $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ reveals the onset of tunnel ionization at intensities above $10~\mathrm{TW/cm^2}$. Our findings provide new insights into the nonlinear optical properties of $\mathrm{Cs_3Sb}$ and $\mathrm{Cs_2Te}$, contributing to the optimization of these materials for the development of next-generation photoinjectors.

Title: Local probe evidence supporting altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$
Authors: J.N. Graham, T.J. Hicken, R.B. Regmi, M. Janoschek, I. Mazin, H. Luetkens, N.J. Ghimire, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: Muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), combined with muon stopping site and local field analysis, was used to investigate the magnetic properties of cobalt intercalated 2H-NbSe$_2$ (Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$). Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ is predicted to be an altermagnet, and whilst neutron diffraction has proposed its magnetic structure, microscopic details such as the magnetic volume fraction remain unclear. Therefore, a local probe investigation of its magnetism is essential. Here, we report the determination of the magnetically ordered volume fraction, ordered moment size, and magnetic structure. Our results reveal a sharp second-order transition to a full-volume-fraction, homogeneous magnetic order below $T_\mathrm{N}~=~168~$K. The moments are aligned antiparallel along the $c$-axis, consistent with neutron diffraction and altermagnetism. ${\mu}$SR reveals that the state remains stable under a $c$-axis magnetic field up to $0.78~$T, with magnetisation measurements suggesting this robust regimes extends to at least $5$~T. Within the time resolution of ${\mu}$SR, no precursor slow altermagnetic fluctuations were detected above $T_\mathrm{N}$, which is important for interpreting the band splitting in the paramagnetic state reported by photoemission studies. These findings support altermagnetism in Co$_{1/4}$NbSe$_2$ and motivate further experiments to explore the tunability of its magnetic and electronic structure.

Title: Cooperation and competing of antipolar charge order and superconducting states in a quasi-2D superatomic metallic crystal

Abstract: Exploring various unexpected new quantum states and their corresponding extraordinary physics in low dimensional quantum materials, and investing them into application fields, is a primary concern of condensed matter physics. Previously, we performed joint experiments and theoretical calculations to investigate a superatomic crystal of Au6Te12Se8 with low symmetry, which stacks through non-covalent inter-cube quasi-bonds. Au6Te12Se8 exhibits a triple-cube charge density wave and spatially polarized metallic states interweaving at 9 K. In addition, it undergoes a BKT phase transition at 2.8 K to form a quasi-two-dimensional superconducting state. The subsequent high-pressure experimental results indicate that the two quantum states above compete with superconductivity. Here, we experimentally revealed competition and coexistence among superconductivity, triple-cube charge density waves, and polarized metallic states during further temperature-decreasing process, as examined using ultra-low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy, transport measurement, and Raman spectra. An extraordinary inversion symmetry broken emerged inside the triple-cube-period of the original CDW at 300 mK, leading to the polarized metallic states transforming into parallel polarization states. The evidence of spontaneous polarization coexisting with superconductivity in real space is extremely rare and has been revealed by STM. In addition, transport and Raman measurements indicate that there are multiple phase transition temperatures from 80K to that below the superconducting transition temperature of Au6Te12Se8, which may also contain more unknown exotic quantum states, providing a platform for further exploration of intriguing physical properties.

Title: Contrasting $c$-axis and in-plane uniaxial stress effects on superconductivity and stripe order in La$_{1.885}$Ba$_{0.115}$CuO$_4$
Authors: S.S. Islam, V. Sazgari, J.N. Graham, O. Gerguri, P. Král, I. Maetsu, H. Gopakumar, M. Müller, R. Sarkar, V. Grinenko, G. Simutis, T. Shiroka, R. Khasanov, M. Janoschek, J.M. Tranquada, H.H. Klauss, T. Adachi, H. Luetkens, Z. Guguchia
Abstract: The cuprate superconductor La$_{2-x}$Ba$_x$CuO$_4$ (LBCO) near $x=0.125$ is a striking example of intertwined electronic orders, where 3D superconductivity is anomalously suppressed, allowing spin and charge stripe order to develop, in a manner consistent with the emergence of a pair-density-wave (PDW) state. Understanding this interplay remains a key challenge in cuprates, highlighting the necessity of external tuning for deeper insight. While in-plane (within the CuO plane) uniaxial stress enhances superconductivity and suppresses stripe order, the effects of $c$-axis compression (perpendicular to the CuO plane) remains largely unexplored. Here, we use muon spin rotation ($\mu$SR) and AC susceptibility with an in situ piezoelectric stress device to investigate the spin-stripe order and superconductivity in LBCO-0.115 under $c$-axis compression. The measurements reveal a gradual suppression of the superconducting transition temperature ($T_{\rm c}$) with increasing $c$-axis stress, in stark contrast to the strong enhancement observed under in-plane stress. We further show that while in-plane stress rapidly reduces both the magnetic volume fraction ($V_{\rm m}$) and the spin-stripe ordering temperature ($T_{\rm so}$), $c$-axis compression has no effect, with $V_{\rm m}$ and $T_{\rm so}$ exhibiting an almost unchanged behavior up to the highest applied stress of 0.21 GPa. These findings demonstrate a strong anisotropy in stress response, underscoring the critical role of crystallographic anisotropy in governing competing electronic phases in LBCO.

Title: Ab initio study of angle-resolved electron reflection spectroscopy of few-layer graphene
Authors: Aleš Paták, Martin Zouhar, Ivo Konvalina, Eliška Materna Mikmeková, Lukáš Průcha, Ilona Müllerová, Anna Charvátová Campbell, Miroslav Valtr, Michal Horák, Vlastimil Křápek, Eugene Krasovskii
Abstract: We present ab initio theory for electron reflection spectroscopy of few-layer graphene for arbitrary angles of incidence. The inelastic effects are included in a consistent way using the optical potential retrieved from ab initio simulations of electron energy-loss spectra. We demonstrate a significant impact of inelastic effects even for single-layer graphene. Next, we address the ability of the electron reflection spectroscopy to determine specific parameters of graphene including not only the number of layers in the few-layer graphene but also the stacking type in the graphene multilayers, and to resolve moiré patterns in twisted graphene bilayers. We show that the predicted contrast, although significantly reduced by inelastic effects, is sufficient for the experimental detection of all considered parameters. Our findings are corroborated by a fair correspondence of our theoretical predictions with experimental data, both our own and recently published by other authors.

Title: Dielectric Softening in Halide Double Perovskites via an unusual Pseudo-Triggered Mechanism
Authors: Urmimala Dey, Jordan A.R Cowell, Nicholas C. Bristowe
Abstract: Halide perovskites have emerged as promising candidates for next generation photovoltaic applications, attracting significant attention in recent years. Through first-principles calculations combined with group-theoretical analyses, we investigate the structural phase diagram of Pb-free Jahn-Teller-active $A_2$Au$_2X_6$ ($A$: Cs, Rb; $X$: Cl, Br, I) double perovskites. Our study identifies a previously unreported ferroelectric phase, where the softening of the polar mode$-$key to ferroelectricity$-$is driven by an unconventional and indirect coupling with improper strains originating from Jahn-Teller distortions. The proposed strain mediated \textit{pseudo}-triggered mechanism offers an alternative pathway to enhance the static dielectric constant or even promote (photo-)ferroelectricity, addressing challenges such as defects, excitons, and charge scattering that hinder photovoltaic efficiency. More broadly, this novel mechanism could be extended to oxide double perovskites and opens up a new type of ferroelectric phase transition worthy of future investigation.

Title: Driven-dissipative turbulence in exciton-polariton quantum fluids
Authors: R. Ferrini, S.V. Koniakhin
Abstract: The present paper is devoted to comprehensive theoretical studies of exction-polariton quantum fluids specificities in the optics of their utilization for quantum turbulence research. We show that a non-trivial implementation of time-varying potential for excitation of quantum fluid (injection of quantized vortices) via the stirring procedure can be efficiently substituted with resonant excitation-based phase-imprinting techniques. The most efficient phase pattern corresponds to imprinting of tiles with randomly oriented plane waves in each. The resulting turbulent flows, spatial vortex distributions, and clustering statistics resemble those for the case of a conventional spoon-stirring scheme. We quantify the limitations on the lifetime and density depletion for the development and sustainability of quantum turbulence. The yield is the necessity to prevent the density depletion for more than one order of magnitude. Finally, we demonstrate that turbulence is robust with respect to alternating gain and loss at a certain range of modulation parameters, which corresponds to laser operating above and below condensation threshold.

Title: Graph-Dynamics correspondence in metallic glass-forming liquids
Authors: Xin-Jia Zhou, Feng Yang, Xiao-Dong Yang, Lin Ma, Zhen-Wei Wu
Abstract: Theoretical challenges in understanding the nature of glass and the glass transition remain significant open questions in statistical and condensed matter physics. As a prototypical example of complex physical systems, glasses and the vitrification process have been central research topics, consistently attracting broad scientific interest. This focus has driven extensive studies on phenomena such as aging, non-exponential relaxation, dynamic anomalies, glass-forming ability, and the mechanical response of glasses under stress. Recent advances in computational and experimental techniques have enabled rigorous testing of theoretical models, shedding new light on glassy behavior. However, the intrinsic complexity of glass and the glass transition that lies in their physics, which spans multiple length and time scales, makes the system challenging to characterize. In this review, we emphasize the need to move beyond conventional approaches and propose a topological perspective as a promising alternative to address these challenges. Specifically, our findings reveal that the diversity in particle relaxation behavior is statistically linked to a global topological feature of the transient network structures formed by the particles in a given liquid. This direction offers opportunities to uncover novel phenomena that could fundamentally reshape our understanding of glassy materials.

Title: The Role of Quantum Vibronic Effects in the Spin Polarization of Charge Transport through Molecular Junctions
Authors: Samuel L. Rudge, Christoph Kaspar, Rudolf Smorka, Riley J. Preston, Joseph Subotnik, Michael Thoss
Abstract: The connection between molecular vibrations and spin polarization in charge transport through molecular junctions is currently a topic of high interest, with important consequences for a variety of phenomena, such as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). In this work, we follow this theme by exploring the relationship between vibronic dynamics and the corresponding spin polarization of the nonequilibrium charge current in a molecular junction. We employ the hierarchical equations of motion (HEOM) approach, which, since it is numerically exact and treats the vibrational degrees of freedom quantum mechanically, extends previous analyses of similar models that relied on approximate transport methods. We find significant spin polarization of the charge current in the off-resonant, low-voltage regime, where the vibrations must be treated quantum mechanically. Furthermore, we are able to connect the spin polarization in the charge transport to a corresponding polarization of the vibrational dynamics, which manifests itself in the vibrational angular momentum and excitation. Our analysis covers multiple molecule-lead couplings, temperatures, orbital energies, and spin-orbit couplings, demonstrating that the vibrationally assisted spin polarization is robust across a broad range of parameters.

Title: Microscopic evidence for spin-spinless stripe order with reduced Ni moments within $ab$ plane for bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ probed by $^{139}$La-NQR
Authors: Mitsuharu Yashima, Nina Seto, Yujiro Oshita, Masataka Kakoi, \\Hiroya Sakurai, Yoshihiko Takano, Hidekazu Mukuda
Abstract: The intrinsic electronic properties of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ have been selectively investigated by nuclear quadrupole resonance (NQR) at the La(2) site outside the NiO$_2$ bilayers. The La(2)$_{\rm a}$ site of the ideal La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ is clearly distinguished from the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site close to the local defects. Below 150K, almost half of the intrinsic La(2)$_{\rm a}$ sites are dominated by a finite internal field within the $ab$ plane, while the other half are dominated by zero internal field. The result is fully consistent with the single spin-spinless stripe order of ($\cdots\uparrow\circ\downarrow\circ\uparrow\circ\cdots$), where the reduced Ni magnetic moments are parallel to the $ab$-plane. Even for the La(2)$_{\rm b}$ site, the result is also explained within the same model by considering the inhomogeneous internal magnetic fields enhanced around the nearby defects such as oxygen vacancies. These findings provide unambiguous microscopic evidence for the single spin-spinless stripe order below 150 K at ambient pressure.

Title: PolyMorph: Extension of PolyHoop for tissue morphogenesis coupled to chemical signaling
Authors: Nicolas Pascal Guido Müller, Roman Vetter
Abstract: We present PolyMorph, a lightweight standalone C++ program that extends its predecessor PolyHoop by a finite-difference solver for multi-component reaction-advection-diffusion equations. PolyMorph simulates two integral parts of tissue morphogenesis in two dimensions: 1) the mechanics of cellular deformation, growth and proliferation, and 2) transport and reaction of an arbitrary number of chemical species. Both of these components are bidirectionally coupled, allowing cells to base their behavior on local information on concentrations and flow, and allowing the chemical transport and reaction kinetics to depend on spatial information such as the local cell type. This bidirectional feedback makes PolyMorph a versatile tool to study a variety of cellular morphogenetic processes such as chemotaxis, cell sorting, tissue patterning with morphogen gradients, Turing patterning, and diffusion- or supply-limited growth with sub-cellular resolution.

Title: Schrödinger Bridges for Systems of Interacting Particles
Authors: Henri Orland
Abstract: A Schrödinger bridge is the most probable time-dependent probability distribution that connects an initial probability distribution $w_{i}$ to a final one $w_{f}$. The problem has been solved and widely used for the case of simple Brownian evolution (non-interacting particles). It is related to the problem of entropy regularized Wasserstein optimal transport. In this article, we generalize Brownian bridges to systems of interacting particles. We derive some equations for the forward and backward single particle ``wave-functions'' which allow to compute the most probable evolution of the single-particle probability between the initial and final distributions.

Title: Melting of rods on a sphere via an intermediate hexatic phase
Authors: Jaydeep Mandal, Chandan Dasgupta, Prabal K. Maiti
Abstract: We have studied, using molecular dynamics simulations, the pressure-induced melting in a monolayer of soft repulsive spherocylinders whose centers of mass are constrained to move on the surface of a sphere. We show that the orientational degrees of freedom of the spherocylinders exhibit nematic order, whereas the positions of their centers of mass exhibit melting transitions that depend on the radius of the confining spherical surface. Our system presents a unique scenario where the decoupling of the orientational degrees of freedom from the positional degrees of freedom leads to an effectively two-dimensional (2D) crystal-to-liquid transition on a spherical surface. Further study of the nature of this 2D melting on a sphere shows that the transition is a two-step process, and there exists a very small window of an intermediate hexatic phase between crystal and liquid phases. Similar results are found for flat monolayers (with the radius of the sphere $ R \rightarrow \infty $). We show that, interestingly, the structure of the defects, originating from the curvature of the substrate, also changes during melting.

Title: Canonical equilibrium of mean-field $O(n)$~models in presence of random fields
Authors: Soumya Kanti Pal, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: We study canonical-equilibrium properties of Random Field $O(n)$ Models involving classical continuous vector spins of $n$ components with mean-field interactions and subject to disordered fields acting on individual spins. To this end, we employ two complementary approaches: the mean-field approximation, valid for any disorder distribution, and the replica trick, applicable when the disordered fields are sampled from a Gaussian distribution. On the basis of an exact analysis, we demonstrate that when replica symmetry holds, both the approaches yield identical expression for the free energy per spin of the system. As consequences, we study the case of $n=2$ ($XY$ spins) and that of $n=3$ (Heisenberg spins) for two representative choices of the disorder distribution, namely, a Gaussian and a symmetric bimodal distribution. For both $n=2$ and $n=3$, we demonstrate that while the magnetization exhibits a continuous phase transition as a function of temperature for the Gaussian case, the transition could be either continuous or first-order with an emergent tricriticality when the disorder distribution is bimodal. We also discuss in the context of our models the issue of self-averaging of extensive variables near the critical point of a continuous phase transition.

Title: A Fresh Perspective on Water Dynamics in Aqueous Salt Solutions
Authors: Rolf Zeißler, Florian Pabst, Thomas Blochowicz
Abstract: Molecular dynamics in pure water and aqueous salt solutions remain incompletely understood, partly due to the apparent contradictions between results from different spectroscopic techniques. In this work, we demonstrate, by detailed comparison of light scattering and dielectric spectroscopy data for pure water and aqueous lithium chloride solutions, that these apparent contradictions can be resolved by accounting for orientational cross-correlations of neighboring molecules. Remarkably, a single structural relaxation mode with largely temperature- and concentration-independent shape can be identified in all spectra, from room temperature down to the deeply supercooled regime. These results provide a new perspective for the study of molecular dynamics in aqueous salt solutions.

Title: Imaging neutron radiation-induced defects in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamond at the atomic level
Authors: Jialiang Zhang, Futao Huang, Shuo Li, Guojun Yu, Zifeng Xu, Lifu Hei, Fanxiu Lv, Aidan Horne, Peng Wang, Ming Qi
Abstract: Diamond's exceptional properties make it highly suited for applications in challenging radiation environments. Understanding radiation-induced damage in diamond is crucial for enabling its practical applications and advancing materials science. However, direct imaging of radiation-induced crystal defects at the atomic scale remains rare due to diamond's compact lattice structure. Here, we report the atomic-level characterization of crystal defects induced by high-flux fast neutron radiation (up to $3 \times10^{17}$ n/$cm^2$) in single-crystal chemical vapor deposition diamonds. Through Raman spectroscopy, the phase transition from carbon $sp^3$ to $sp^2$ hybridization was identified, primarily associated with the formation of dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects. Using electron energy loss spectroscopy and aberration-corrected transmission electron microscopy, we observed a clustering trend in defect distribution, where $sp^2$ rich clusters manifested as dislocation structures with a density up to $10^{14}$ $cm^{-2}$. Lomer-Cottrell junctions were identified, offering a possible explanation for defect cluster formation. Radiation-induced point defects were found to be dispersed throughout the diamond lattice, highlighting the widespread nature of primary defect formation. Vacancy defects, along with $\langle 111 \rangle$ and $\langle 100 \rangle$ oriented dumbbell-shaped interstitial defects induced by high-dose neutron irradiation, were directly imaged, providing microscopic structural evidence that complements spectroscopic studies of point defects. Dynamical simulations combined with an adiabatic recombination-based damage model provided insights into the correlation between irradiation dose and resulting crystal damage. These findings advance our understanding of neutron-induced damage mechanisms in diamond and contribute to the development of radiation-resistant diamond materials.

Title: Recurrent neural network analysis of single trajectories switching between anomalous diffusion states
Authors: Alvaro Lanza, Xiang Qu, Stefano Bo
Abstract: Diffusive dynamics abound in nature and have been especially studied in physical, biological, and financial systems. These dynamics are characterised by a linear growth of the mean squared displacement (MSD) with time. Often, the conditions that give rise to simple diffusion are violated, and many systems, such as biomolecules inside cells, microswimmers, or particles in turbulent flows, undergo anomalous diffusion, featuring an MSD that grows following a power law with an exponent $\alpha$. Precisely determining this exponent and the generalised diffusion coefficient provides valuable information on the systems under consideration, but it is a very challenging task when only a few short trajectories are available, which is common in non-equilibrium and living systems. Estimating the exponent becomes overwhelmingly difficult when the diffusive dynamics switches between different behaviours, characterised by different exponents $\alpha$ or diffusion coefficients $K$. We develop a method based on recurrent neural networks that successfully estimates the anomalous diffusion exponents and generalised diffusion coefficients of individual trajectories that switch between multiple diffusive states. Our method returns the $\alpha$ and $K$ as a function of time and identifies the times at which the dynamics switches between different behaviours. We showcase the method's capabilities on the dataset of the 2024 Anomalous Diffusion Challenge.

Title: Dimension-raising phase transitions in driven magnets and condensates
Authors: Zhizhen Chen, Zi Cai
Abstract: We propose a periodically driven system whose dimensionality is an emergent property that can be tunable, thus enables us to realize not only many-body phases with arbitrary dimensions, but also phase transitions, instead of crossovers, between phases with various dimensions. We study an interacting rotor model whose instantaneous Hamiltonian keeps the one-dimensional (1D) feature at any given time. Despite this, an emergent two-dimensional (2D) phase appears when the driving frequency exceeds a critical value, at which a dimension-raising phase transition takes place. We find that the nonequilibrium feature of the system could qualitatively change the finite temperature critical behavior of the emergent 2D phase and make it different from its equilibrium counterpart. A four-dimensional (4D) generalization and experimental realizations of the proposed model based on a programmable reconfiguration technique in optical tweezers setups have also been discussed.

Title: Diagnostics of Hilbert space fragmentation, freezing transition and its effects in the family of quantum East models involving varying ranges of facilitated hopping
Authors: Sreemayee Aditya
Abstract: This paper explores the effect of strong-to-weak fragmentation transition, namely freezing transition, and its rich characteristics in a family of one-dimensional spinless fermionic models involving short-to-long-range facilitated hoppings with an East constraint. Focusing on this family of models with range-$q$ terms, our investigation furnishes an exhaustive understanding of the fractured Hilbert space utilizing the enumerative combinatorics and transfer matrix methods. This further allows us to get insight into the freezing transition in this family of models with the help of the generalization of Catalan numbers introduced by Frey and Sellers for $q>1$, further revealing that increasing the range of constraints drives the transition to transpire at lower filling fractions as $n_c = 1/(q+1)$. This distinct fragmentation structure also yields the emergence of ground states at multiple fillings; further, the ground state exhibits signatures of criticality with logarithmic scaling of entanglement entropy. Thereafter, our investigation exemplifies that the above transition has a profound impact on the thermalization of bulk and boundary autocorrelators at long times, which includes an intricate filling-dependent inhomogeneous long-time autocorrelation profiles across the chain in OBCs. Finally, we probe the effect of the same on the transport at intermediate times in PBCs, restricting ourselves to models up to range-3 constraints. This investigation discloses a vast range of anomalous transport possibilities, ranging from size-stretched exponential relaxation through superdiffusive to subdiffusive behaviors akin to the fragmentation structure supported by the filling fraction and range of constraints. In brevity, our paper reveals intriguing possibilities conspired by an intriguing interplay between constraints with varying ranges, fragmentation structure, and freezing transition.

Title: Effective conductivity of conduit networks with random conductivities
Authors: I. Colecchio, E. Le Gall, B. Noetinger
Abstract: The effective conductivity ($T^{eff}$) of 2D and 3D Random Resistor Networks (RRNs) with random edge conductivity is studied. The combined influence of geometrical disorder, which controls the overall connectivity of the medium and leads to percolation effects, and conductivity randomness is investigated. A formula incorporating connectivity aspects and second-order averaging methods, widely used in the stochastic hydrology community, is derived and extrapolated to higher orders using a power averaging formula based on a mean-field argument. This approach highlights the role of the so-called resistance distance introduced by graph theorists. Simulations are performed on various RRN geometries constructed from 2D and 3D bond-percolation lattices. The results confirm the robustness of the power averaging technique and the relevance of the mean-field assumption.

Title: Capturing non-equilibrium electron dynamics in metals accurately and efficiently
Authors: M. Uehlein, H. T. Snowden, C. Seibel, T. Held, S. T. Weber, R. J. Maurer, B. Rethfeld
Abstract: The simulation of non-equilibrium electron distributions is essential for capturing light-metal interactions and therefore the study of photoabsorption, photocatalysis, laser ablation, and many other phenomena. Current methodologies, such as the Boltzmann equation using full collision integrals, describe non-equilibrium electron dynamics in great detail but at often prohibitive computational expense. In contrast, the simplification via a relaxation time approach can hinder the description of important features or, even worse, lead to nonphysical behavior due to the lack of particle and energy conservation. We propose a model that bridges the gap between the Boltzmann equation and two-temperature models to trace non-equilibrium distributions efficiently. This Athermal Electron Model (AthEM) separately captures the dynamics of thermal and athermal electrons and describes the energy and particle flow between two electronic systems and phonons. We show that the results align well with the results of Boltzmann equation and data from photoemission experiments. The AthEM enables the rapid generation of qualitatively accurate non-equilibrium electron distributions and provides a good starting point for further extensions.

Title: Ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions driven by surface acoustic sawtooth waves
Authors: Philipp Schwenke, Ephraim Spindler, Vitaliy I. Vasyuchka, Alexandre Abbass Hamadeh, Philipp Pirro, Mathias Weiler
Abstract: The manipulation of skyrmions by surface acoustic waves (SAW) has garnered significant interest in the field of spintronic devices. Previous studies established that skyrmions can be generated and moved by strain pulses. In this study, we propose that sawtooth-SAWs can be used to drive a ratchet motion of magnetic skyrmions in the presence of pinning centers. This results in a net motion of the skyrmions orthogonal to the continuously applied SAW. The ratchet motion is fundamentally caused by non-vanishing pinning, so that a certain strain gradient magnitude is required to overcome pinning and start skyrmion motion. We demonstrate the feasibility of our concept by micromagnetic simulations and analytical model calculations.

Title: Materials Discovery With Quantum-Enhanced Machine Learning Algorithms
Authors: Ignacio F. Graña, Savvas Varsamopoulos, Tatsuhito Ando, Hiroyuki Maeshima, Nobuyuki N. Matsuzawa
Abstract: Materials discovery is a computationally intensive process that requires exploring vast chemical spaces to identify promising candidates with desirable properties. In this work, we propose using quantum-enhanced machine learning algorithms following the extremal learning framework to predict novel heteroacene structures with low hole reorganization energy $\lambda$, a key property for organic semiconductors. We leverage chemical data generated in a previous large-scale virtual screening to construct three initial training datasets containing 54, 99 and 119 molecules encoded using $N=7,16$ and 22 bits, respectively. Furthermore, a sequential learning process is employed to augment the initial training data with compounds predicted by the algorithms through iterative retraining. Both algorithms are able to successfully extrapolate to heteroacene structures with lower $\lambda$ than in the initial dataset, demonstrating good generalization capabilities even when the amount of initial data is limited. We observe an improvement in the quality of the predicted compounds as the number of encoding bits $N$ increases, which offers an exciting prospect for applying the algorithms to richer chemical spaces that require larger values of $N$ and hence, in perspective, larger quantum circuits to deploy the proposed quantum-enhanced protocols.

Title: Pressure-induced strange metal phase in a metallic kagome ferromagnet
Authors: Bin Shen, Feng Du, Franziska Breitner, Victoria A. Ginga, Ece Uykur, Alexander A. Tsirlin, Philipp Gegenwart
Abstract: Strange metallicity with $T$-linear electrical resistance preceding high-$T_c$ superconductivity remains an enigmatic, yet crucial, signature of correlation physics. Using electrical transport and magnetization measurements up to 50 GPa, we show that such a strange-metal phase is formed in pressurized kagome ferromagnet CrNiAs. In contrast to other kagome materials, a linear suppression of the Curie temperature is found, with the ferromagnetic quantum critical point at $p_{\rm{c}} \approx 12.5$ GPa. Remarkably, from $p_{\rm{c}}$ up to the highest measured pressure, characteristic strange-metal behavior is observed, whereas magnetic field reinstates the Fermi liquid. Electronic structure calculations reveal robust weakly dispersive bands persisting unchanged beyond $p_{\rm{c}}$, possibly at the origin of the $T$-linear electrical resistance. This establishes pressurized kagome ferromagnets as an intriguing platform for strange-metal behavior.

Title: Two distinct quantum critical behaviors in the doped two-dimensional periodic Anderson model
Authors: M. Kitatani, T. Schäfer, A. A. Katanin, A. Toschi, K. Held
Abstract: We study quantum criticality in the doped two-dimensional periodic Anderson model with the hybridization acting as a tuning parameter. Employing the dynamical vertex approximation we find two distinct quantum critical behaviors. One is a quantum critical point between the antiferromagnetically ordered and the Kondo state, both metallic with itinerant $f$ electrons. Here, we obtained the critical exponent $\gamma \approx 1$ for the temperature dependence of the antiferromagnetic susceptibility. We observe a \emph{second} quantum critical behavior with $\gamma=2$ above the continuing zero-temperature magnetic order, at a quantum critical point where the $f$ electrons turn from localized to itinerant.

Title: Anisotropic temperature-dependent lattice parameters and elastic constants from first principles
Authors: Samare Rostami, Matteo Giantomassi, Xavier Gonze
Abstract: The Quasi-harmonic Approximation (QHA) is a widely used method for calculating the temperature dependence of lattice parameters and the thermal expansion coefficients from first principles. However, applying QHA to anisotropic systems typically requires several dozens or even hundreds of phonon band structure calculations, leading to high computational costs. The Zero Static Internal Stress Approximation (ZSISA) QHA method partly addresses such caveat, but the computational load of its implementation remains high, so that its volumetric-only counterpart v-ZSISA-QHA is preferred. In this work, we present an efficient implementation of the ZSISA-QHA, enabling its application across a wide range of crystal structures under varying temperature (T) and pressure (P) conditions. By incorporating second-order derivatives of the vibrational free energy with respect to lattice degrees of freedom, we significantly reduce the number of required phonon band structure calculations for the determination of all lattice parameters and angles. For hexagonal, trigonal, and tetragonal systems, only six phonon band structure calculations are needed, while 10, 15, and 28 calculations suffice for orthorhombic, monoclinic, and triclinic systems, respectively. This method is tested for a variety of non-cubic materials, from uniaxial ones like ZnO and CaCO3 to monoclinic or triclinic materials such as ZrO2, HfO2, and Al2SiO5, demonstrating a significant reduction in computational effort while maintaining accuracy in modeling anisotropic thermal expansion, unlike the v-ZSISA-QHA. The method is also applied to the first-principles calculation of temperature-dependent elastic constants, with only up to six more phonon band structure calculations, depending on the crystallographic system.

Title: Spectral properties of a disordered insulating lattice under nonlinear electric field
Authors: Kunal Mozumdar, Herbert F. Fotso, Jong E. Han (University at Buffalo, SUNY, Buffalo, NY)
Abstract: Quenched disorder in a solid state system can result in Anderson localization where electrons are exponentially localized and the system behaves like an insulator. In this study, we investigate the effect of a DC electric field on Anderson localization. The study highlights the case of a one-dimensional insulator chain with on-site disorder when a DC electric field is applied throughout the chain. We study spectral properties of an Anderson localized system in equilibrium and out-of-equilibrium using a full lattice nonequilibrium Green's function method in the steady-state limit. Tuning the disorder and the electric field strength results in the creation of exponential Lifshitz tails near the band edge by strongly localized levels. These Lifshtiz tails create effects like insulator-to-metal transitions and contribute to non-local hopping. The electric field causes gradual delocalization of the system and Anderson localization crossing over to Wannier Stark ladders at very strong fields. Our study makes a comparison with the coherent potential approximation (CPA) highlighting some major differences and similarities in the physics of disorder.

Title: Observation of Fermi acceleration with cold atoms
Authors: G. Barontini, V. Naniyil, J. P. Stinton, D. Reid, J. M. F. Gunn, H. M. Price, A. B. Deb, D. Caprioli, V. Guarrera
Abstract: Cosmic rays are deemed to be generated by a process known as ``Fermi acceleration", in which charged particles scatter against magnetic fluctuations in astrophysical plasmas. The process itself is however universal, has both classical and quantum formulations, and is at the basis of dynamical systems with interesting mathematical properties, such as the celebrated Fermi-Ulam model. Despite its effectiveness in accelerating particles, Fermi acceleration has so far eluded unambiguous verifications in laboratory settings. Here, we realize the first fully controllable Fermi accelerator by colliding ultracold atoms against engineered movable potential barriers. We demonstrate that our Fermi accelerator, which is only 100 um in size, can produce ultracold atomic jets with velocities above half a meter per second. Adding dissipation, we also experimentally test Bell's general argument for the ensuing energy spectra, which is at the basis of any model of cosmic ray acceleration. On the one hand, our work effectively opens the window to the study of high energy astrophysics with cold atoms, offering new capabilities for the understanding of phenomena such as diffusive acceleration at collisionless shocks. On the other, the performance of our Fermi accelerator is competitive with those of best-in-class accelerating methods used in quantum technology and quantum colliders, but with substantially simpler implementation and virtually no upper limit.

Title: Evolution of Adaptive Force Chains in Reconfigurable Granular Metamaterials
Authors: Sven Witthaus, Atoosa Parsa, Dong Wang, Nidhi Pashin, Jerry Zhang, Arthur K. MacKeith, Mark D. Shattuck, Josh Bongard, Corey S. O'Hern, Rebecca Kramer-Bottiglio
Abstract: Under an externally applied load, granular packings form force chains that depend on the contact network and moduli of the grains. In this work, we investigate packings of variable modulus (VM) particles, where we can direct force chains by changing the Young's modulus of individual particles within the packing on demand. Each VM particle is made of a silicone shell that encapsulates a core made of a low-melting-point metallic alloy (Field's metal). By sending an electric current through a co-located copper heater, the Field's metal internal to each particle can be melted via Joule heating, which softens the particle. As the particle cools to room temperature, the alloy solidifies and the particle recovers its original modulus. To optimize the mechanical response of granular packings containing both soft and stiff particles, we employ an evolutionary algorithm coupled with discrete element method simulations to predict the patterns of particle moduli that will yield specific force outputs on the assembly boundaries. The predicted patterns of particle moduli from the simulations were realized in experiments using 2D assemblies of VM particles and the force outputs on the assembly boundaries were measured using photoelastic techniques. These studies represent a step towards making robotic granular metamaterials that can dynamically adapt their mechanical properties in response to different environmental conditions or perform specific tasks on demand.

Title: Long-Time Limits of Local Operator Entanglement in Interacting Integrable Models
Authors: J. Alexander Jacoby, Sarang Gopalakrishnan
Abstract: We explore the long-time behavior of Local Operator Entanglement entropy (LOE) in finite-size interacting integrable systems. For certain operators in the Rule 54 automaton, we prove that the LOE saturates to a value that is at most logarithmic in system size. The logarithmic bound relies on a feature of Rule 54 that does not generalize to other interacting integrable systems: namely, that there are only two types of quasiparticles, and therefore only two possible values of the phase shift between quasiparticles. We present a heuristic argument, supported by numerical evidence, that for generic interacting integrable systems (such as the Heisenberg spin chain) the saturated value of the LOE is volume-law in system size.

Title: Localisation of hexagonal boron nitride colour centres using patterned dielectric layers on graphene
Authors: M. K. Prasad, V. Babenko, A.W. Tadbier, S. Hofmann, J. P. Goss, J. D. Mar
Abstract: One of the most promising building blocks for the development of spin qubits, single-photon sources, and quantum sensors at room temperature, as well as 2D ultraviolet light-emitting diodes, are defect colour centres in 2D hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). However, a significant requirement for the realisation of such devices towards scalable technologies is the deterministic localisation of hBN colour centres. Here, we demonstrate a novel approach to the localisation of hBN colour centre emission by using patterned dielectric layers grown on graphene via atomic layer deposition (ALD). While colour centre emission is quenched within areas where hBN is deposited directly on graphene due to charge transfer, it is maintained where hBN is deposited on micron-sized Al2O3 pillars which act as barriers to charge transfer. Importantly, our approach allows for device architectures where graphene layers are used as top and bottom electrodes for the application of vertical electric fields, such as for carrier injection in electroluminescent devices, Stark shifting of colour centre emission, and charge state control of defect colour centres. Furthermore, the use of ALD to grow dielectric layers directly on graphene allows for the control of tunnel barrier thicknesses with atomic layer precision, which is crucial for many of these device applications. Our work represents an important step towards the realisation of a wide range of scalable device applications based on the determinsitic localisation of electrically controlled hBN colour centres

Title: Universal Properties of Critical Mixed States from Measurement and Feedback
Authors: Zhehao Zhang, Yijian Zou, Timothy H. Hsieh, Sagar Vijay
Abstract: We explore the universal properties of mixed quantum matter obtained from "single-shot" adaptive evolution, in which a quantum-critical ground-state is manipulated through a single round of local measurements and local unitary operations conditioned on spatially-distant measurement outcomes. The resulting mixed quantum states are characterized by altered long-distance correlations between local observables, mixed-state entropy, and entanglement negativity. By invoking a coarse-grained, continuum description of single-shot adaptation in (1+1) dimensions, we find that the extensive mixed-state entropy exhibits a sub-leading, constant correction ($\gamma$), while the entanglement negativity can grow logarithmically with sub-region size, with a coefficient ($\alpha$); both constants can attain universal values which are distinct from the expected behavior in any quantum-critical ground-state. We investigate these properties in single-shot adaptation on ($i$) the critical point between a one-dimensional $Z_{2}\times Z_{2}$ symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and a symmetry-broken state, and ($ii$) a spinful Tomonaga-Luttinger liquid. In the former case, adaptive evolution that decoheres one sublattice of the SPT can yield a critical mixed-state in which $\alpha$ attains a universal value, which is half of that in the original state. In the latter case, we show how adaptation -- involving feedback on the spin degrees of freedom, after measuring the local charge -- modifies long-distance correlations, and determine via an exact replica field-theoretic calculation that $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ vary continuously with the strength of feedback. Numerical studies confirm these results.

Title: Odd-parity altermagnetism through sublattice currents: From Haldane-Hubbard model to general bipartite lattices
Authors: Yu-Ping Lin
Abstract: We propose the sublattice currents as a feasible route to odd-parity altermagnetism (ALM), where nonrelativistic collinear spin splitting occurs in the bands as an odd function of momentum. In contrast to previously classified ALMs, the sublattice currents break the time-reversal symmetry in nonmagnetic crystal structures and allow for such odd-parity spin splitting. A representative example is the Haldane-Hubbard model at half filling. Although the compensated collinear magnetic ground state was previously recognized as antiferromagnetism, we show that sublattice currents induce spin splitting in the bands and therefore turn it into an odd-parity ALM. Interestingly, its topological version serves as an example of ALM Chern insulator. We further generalize the Haldane-Hubbard model to common two- and three-dimensional bipartite lattices. With spin splitting from sublattice currents, the compensated collinear magnetic ground states at half filling are generally odd-parity ALM.

Title: Fracton Gauge Theories in Curved Spacetimes
Authors: Evangelos Afxonidis, Alessio Caddeo, Carlos Hoyos, Daniele Musso
Abstract: Fractonic matter with dipole symmetry can be coupled to a two-index symmetric tensor gauge field. In this work, we show that this symmetric tensor field, along with other related generalized Maxwell theories, can be consistently coupled to curved backgrounds in a covariant and gauge-invariant way by reformulating dipole symmetry using conventional vector gauge fields. We identify a family of curved geometries where global dipole symmetry is preserved and derive energy-momentum conservation laws as Ward identities associated with background diffeomorphisms. Our results pave the way for future extensions, including generalizations to higher-order multipole theories.

Title: Quantum systems of atoms with highly singular interaction potentials
Authors: V.I. Yukalov, E.P. Yukalova
Abstract: Quantum statistical systems, composed of atoms or molecules interacting with each other through highly singular non-integrable potentials, are considered. The treatment of such systems cannot start with the standard approximations such as Hartree, Hartree-Fock or Hartree-Fock-Bogolubov approximations because of non-integrability of the interaction potentials leading to divergences. It is shown that the iterative procedure for Green functions can be rearranged so that the starting approximation takes into account regularizing atomic correlations. Then all the following approximation orders contain only the regularized interaction potential producing no divergences. The method of constructing the regularizing correlation function is suggested, based on the solution of the scattering equation in the form of asymptotic series at short distance, which can be extrapolated to arbitrary spatial variables by means of self-similar approximation theory. Regularizing correlation functions for several kinds of atomic systems are exemplified.

Title: Novel design of biplanar electrodes in a multiwell plate for transepithelial electrical resistance measurement in 3D cell cultures
Authors: Georges Dubourg, Divyasree Prabhakaran, Harry Dawson, Vasa Radonic, Sara Joksovic, Jovana Stanojev, Antoni Homs Corbera
Abstract: Recent advances in microphysiological systems have underscored the need for novel sensing and monitoring systems specifically designed for three-dimensional (3D) cell culture. In this article, an original architecture of a cell-culture multiwell plate embedding an impedance spectroscopy monitoring system is presented alongside a fast and straightforward fabrication process that allows scale-up production for further industrial exploitation. Our proposed approach involves a biplanar electrode configuration, enabling real-time and high-throughput impedance spectroscopy measurements through a 3D biological construct. This configuration not only allows for non-invasive electrical characterization of a 3D tissue layer, but also offers the capability to thoroughly analyze and understand the characteristics of any type of biological barrier and 3D tissue. The proof of concept for the developed system has been effectively validated for measuring impedance across both endothelial and mouse myoblast monolayers cultured within a 3D collagen biomimicking matrix. Moreover, transepithelial electrical resistance values, which vary with cell type and duration of cell culture, were effectively determined from the impedance spectra. The obtained results showed that the proposed device allows the monitoring of tight junction and cell layer formation over time without inducing alterations to the cells.

Title: The entropy and temperature of decoupled contributions to energy
Authors: Bryan W Roberts
Abstract: We show that the existence of entropy and temperature is equivalent to a conservation law, which expresses the decoupling of hidden contributions to energy from the measurable ones with respect to some set of measurement procedures. We then apply this technique to define entropy and temperature in an arbitrary dynamical system, where a reduction procedure is specified that recovers the full geometric structure of thermodynamic phase space.

Title: Robust Simulations of Many-Body Symmetry-Protected Topological Phase Transitions on a Quantum Processor
Authors: Ruizhe Shen, Tianqi Chen, Bo Yang, Yin Zhong, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: Topology and symmetry play critical roles in characterizing quantum phases of matter. Recent advancements have unveiled symmetry-protected topological (SPT) phases in many-body systems as a unique class of short-range entangled states, notable for their nontrivial edge modes and characteristic ground-state entanglement gap. In this study, we demonstrate the robust simulation of many-body ground states of an Ising-cluster model on a quantum computer. By employing the method of quantum imaginary-time evolution (QITE) combined with enhanced zero-noise extrapolation techniques, we achieve accurate measurements of the transition between trivial and cluster SPT phases. Furthermore, we measured the characteristic edge modes and their associated topological entanglement properties, such as the second Rényi entropy, reduced density matrix, and entanglement spectral gap. Our work demonstrates the potential of using QITE in investigating sophisticated quantum phase transitions and critical phenomena on quantum computers.

Title: Mixed Anomalies of Magnetic Symmetries
Authors: Aiden Sheckler
Abstract: We resolve the existence of mixed 't Hooft anomalies between the electric and magnetic (solitonic) symmetries in $\sigma$-models and gauge theories. We identify the anomaly as naturally originating from a higher group in the Whitehead tower of the target space. In particular, the magnetic charges (topological solitons) can be interpreted as higher connections on the stages of the Whitehead tower, when pulled back to spacetime. This allows us to derive the form of the $(d+1)$-dim topological theory which classifies the anomaly by inflow. We also find novel features of these anomalies resulting from the mapping class group of the target space. We give many explicit examples, including a discussion of the cases where the higher magnetic symmetries become non-invertible.

Title: Neural Network/de Sitter Space Correspondence
Authors: Donghee Lee, Hye-Sung Lee, Jaeok Yi
Abstract: Machine learning's remarkable practical successes have sparked extensive theoretical investigations, yet fundamental breakthroughs remain elusive. Here, we study neural network training via gradient descent and demonstrate that the resulting dynamics can be described by a field theory in de Sitter space. We illustrate this correspondence with a simple example of neural network in which the continuum limit is explicitly realized. Since de Sitter space is well-studied in both field theory and general relativity, our findings suggest new avenues for understanding neural network training and for leveraging established theoretical frameworks to advance machine learning theory.

Title: A Tutorial on Knots and Quantum Mechanics
Authors: Dmitry Melnikov
Abstract: These notes review a description of quantum mechanics in terms of the topology of spaces, basing on the axioms of Topological Quantum Field Theory and path integral formalism. In this description quantum states and operators are encoded by the topology of spaces that are used as modules to build the quantum mechanical model, while expectation values and probabilities are given by topological invariants of spaces, knots and links. The notes focus on the specific way the topology encodes quantum mechanical features, or, equivalently, on how these features can be controlled through the topology. A topological classification of entanglement is discussed, as well as properties of entanglement entropy and basic quantum protocols. The primary aim is to build a less conventional diagrammatic intuition about quantum mechanics, expanding the paradigm of ``Quantum Picturalism".

Title: Quantum Averaging for High-Fidelity Quantum Logic Gates
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.

Title: Advanced muon-spin spectroscopy with high lateral resolution using Si-pixel detectors
Authors: Lukas Mandok, Pascal Isenring, Heiko Augustin, Marius Köppel, Jonas A. Krieger, Hubertus Luetkens, Thomas Prokscha, Thomas Rudzki, André Schöning, Zaher Salman
Abstract: Muon-spin spectroscopy at continuous sources has stagnated at a stopped muons rate of ~40 kHz for the last few decades. The major limiting factor is the requirement of a single muon in the sample during the typical 10 {\mu}s data gate window. To overcome this limit and to be able to perform muon-spin relaxation ({\mu}SR) measurements on millimeter-sized samples, one can use vertex reconstruction methods to construct {\mu}SR spectra. This is now possible thanks to the availability of very thin monolithic Si-pixel chips, which offer minimal particle scattering and high count rate. Here we present results from a Si-pixel based spectrometer that utilizes vertex reconstruction schemes for the incoming muons and emitted positrons. With this spectrometer we were able to obtain a first vertex reconstructed {\mu}SR (VR-{\mu}SR) spectrum. The unique capabilities and benefits of such a spectrometer are discussed.

Title: Ultraviolet Light-Induced Microwave Mode Tuning in a Rutile TiO$_2$ Whispering Gallery Resonator
Authors: Catriona A. Thomson, Michael E. Tobar, Maxim Goryachev
Abstract: We report the observation of transient nonlinear optical effects in a macroscopic whispering gallery mode resonator made of rutile TiO$_2$, demonstrating strong optical-microwave transduction under laser irradiation. By comparing the effects of ultraviolet (UV, 385 nm) and near-infrared (NIR, 700 nm) radiation, we find that the UV-induced effects are significantly amplified, consistent with the material's semiconductor bandgap energy. The interaction results in frequency shifts of microwave modes and changes in quality factor, suggesting a localized saturable refractive index tuning. This may be attributed to the saturation of a spin transition of a dopant ion within the crystal lattice. Remarkably, these effects are observed at low optical powers, down to nanowatt levels, indicating high sensitivity and efficient of light-matter interaction in this system. The phenomenon is centered around 15 GHz, yet electron spin resonance measurements reveal no zero-field splitting at this frequency, suggesting an alternative mechanism beyond conventional spin resonance. These findings highlight the potential of low-power optical control of microwave modes in high-Q resonators for applications in quantum technologies, sensing, and reconfigurable photonic-microwave systems.

Title: Large-scale multifractality and lack of self-similar decay for Burgers and 3D Navier-Stokes turbulence
Authors: Takeshi Matsumoto, Dipankar Roy, Konstantin Khanin, Rahul Pandit, Uriel Frisch
Abstract: We study decaying turbulence in the 1D Burgers equation (Burgulence) and 3D Navier-Stokes (NS) turbulence. We first investigate the decay in time $t$ of the energy $E(t)$ in Burgulence, for a fractional Brownian initial potential, with Hurst exponent $H$, and demonstrate rigorously a self-similar time-decay of $E(t)$, previously determined heuristically. This is a consequence of the nontrivial boundedness of the energy for any positive time. We define a spatially forgetful \textit{oblivious fractional Brownian motion} (OFBM), with Hurst exponent $H$, and prove that Burgulence, with an OFBM as initial potential $\varphi_0(x)$, is not only intermittent, but it also displays, a hitherto unanticipated, large-scale bifractality or multifractality; the latter occurs if we combine OFBMs, with different values of $H$. This is the first rigorous proof of genuine multifractality for turbulence in a nonlinear hydrodynamical partial differential equation. We then present direct numerical simulations (DNSs) of freely decaying turbulence, capturing some aspects of this multifractality. For Burgulence, we investigate such decay for two cases: (A) $\varphi_0(x)$ a multifractal random walk that crosses over to a fractional Brownian motion beyond a crossover scale $\mathcal{L}$, tuned to go from small- to large-scale multifractality; (B) initial energy spectra $E_0(k)$, with wavenumber $k$, having one or more power-law regions, which lead, respectively, to self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Our analogous DNSs of the 3D NS equations also uncover self-similar and non-self-similar energy decay. Challenges confronting the detection of genuine large-scale multifractality, in numerical and experimental studies of NS and MHD turbulence, are highlighted.

Title: Detuning-symmetric laser cooling of many mechanical modes with a photothermally modified cavity
Authors: Thomas J. Clark, Jiaxing Ma, Jack C. Sankey
Abstract: We simultaneously cool $\gtrsim$100 mechanical modes of a membrane with a photothermally modified optical cavity driven by a single blue-detuned laser. In contrast to radiation pressure and bolometric forces applied directly to the mechanical system, this cooling effect does not depend on the sign of detuning, allowing for single-laser stabilization (i.e., simultaneous positive optical spring and damping) that is especially effective at room temperature and high laser power. We also provide intuition about the competing thermal processes, and propose two simple modifications to the mirror coatings that can strongly enhance this effect.

Title: Topological Degeneracy Induced by Twisting
Authors: Han Peng, Qiang Wang, Meng Xiao, Xiayi Wang, Shining Zhu, Hui Liu
Abstract: In recent years, twisting has emerged as a new degree of freedom that plays an increasingly important role in Bloch bands of various physical systems. However, there is currently a lack of reports on the non-trivial physics of topological degeneracy in twisted systems. In this work, we investigated the intrinsic physical correlation between twisting and topological degeneracy. We found that twisting not only breaks the symmetry of the system but also introduces topological degeneracy that does not exist under the original symmetric system without twisting. Furthermore, the topological degeneracy can be easily tuned through twisting. This new twist-induced topological degeneracy gives rise to a unique polarization-degenerate birefringent medium, wherein the twist angle acts as a novel degree of freedom for dispersion and polarization management of interface states. Exhibiting fascinating properties and experimental feasibilities, our work points to new possibilities in the research of various topological physics in twisted photonics.

Title: Symmetry-Resolved Entanglement Entropy in Higher Dimensions
Authors: Yuanzhu Huang, Yang Zhou
Abstract: We present a method to compute the symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy of spherical regions in higher-dimensional conformal field theories. By employing Casini-Huerta-Myers mapping, we transform the entanglement problem into thermodynamic calculations in hyperbolic space. This method is demonstrated through computations in both free field theories and holographic field theories. For large hyperbolic space volume, our results reveal a universal expansion structure of symmetry-resolved entanglement entropy, with the equipartition property holding up to the constant order. Using asymptotic analysis techniques, we prove this expansion structure and the equipartition property in arbitrary dimensions.

Title: Ultrafast Optical Control of Multi-Valley States in 2D SnS
Authors: Arqum Hashmi, M. Umar Farooq, Mizuki Tani, Kazuhiro Yabana, Tomohito Otobe, Kenichi L. Ishikawa
Abstract: We theoretically study the ultrafast optical control of multiple valley states in two-dimensional (2D) tin sulfide (SnS) monolayers, a member of the layered group-IV monochalcogenides, which is a promising class of materials for overcoming current challenges in valleytronics. By combining time-dependent density functional theory with Maxwells equations, we simulate how both linearly and circularly polarized ultrashort laser pulses affect the electronic excitation dynamics and valley polarization in SnS. Our results reveal that the corrugated phosphorene-like crystal structure of SnS monolayers leads to the emergence of both linear and circular dichroism, allowing flexible manipulation of multi-valley excitation by simply adjusting the light polarization. Moreover, the interplay between broken inversion symmetry and spin-orbit coupling gives rise to distinct Berry curvature effects and spin-valley coupling, thereby enabling circular dichroism. Furthermore, we propose that tuning the carrier-envelope phase of few-cycle femtosecond laser pulses can achieve sub-cycle, ultrafast switching among multiple valleys states. These findings not only deepen our understanding of valley dynamics in 2D materials but may also open new avenues for the development of valleytronic devices.

Title: Universality classes in the time evolution of epidemic outbreaks on complex networks
Authors: Mateusz J. Samsel, Agata Fronczak, Piotr Fronczak
Abstract: We investigate the temporal evolution of epidemic outbreaks in complex networks and identify two distinct universality classes governing their spreading dynamics. Using analytical arguments and large-scale simulations of the susceptible-infected (SI) model, we show that epidemic prevalence follows either a Gompertz-like curve in small-world networks or an Avrami-like curve in fractal complex networks. These findings challenge the traditional mean-field prediction of early-stage exponential growth of infections and highlight the crucial role of network topology in shaping epidemic dynamics. Our results demonstrate that the widely used mean-field approximation, even in its heterogeneous form, fails to accurately describe epidemic spreading, as the assumption of early exponential growth is not justified in either universality class. Additionally, we show that in fractal networks, the basic reproduction number loses its traditional predictive power, as the spreading dynamics are instead governed by microscopic scaling exponents of the network's self-similar structure. This shift underscores the need to revise classical epidemiological models when applied to systems with fractal topology. Our findings provide a refined theoretical framework for modeling spreading processes in complex networks, offering new perspectives for epidemic prediction and control.

Title: A low-background setup for \emph{in-situ} X-ray total scattering combined with fast scanning calorimetry
Authors: Peihao Sun, Jacopo Baglioni, Beatrice Baraldi, Weilong Chen, Daniele Lideo, Lara Piemontese, Francesco Dallari, Marco Di Michiel, Giulio Monaco
Abstract: We demonstrate a setup combining fast scanning calorimetry with X-ray total scattering at a synchrotron beamline, allowing for \emph{in-situ} characterizations of the nano-scale structure of samples during and after temperature scans. The setup features a portable vacuum chamber giving high signal-to-background ratio even on amorphous samples, which enables the observation of detailed structural changes between different sample states. We show three use cases, including one which leverages the high cooling rate of 10$^4$\,K/s achievable by this setup. Our demonstration opens the door to various applications in materials science where it is important to understand the interplay between structure and thermodynamics.

Title: Gauge freedoms in unravelled quantum dynamics: When do different continuous measurements yield identical quantum trajectories?
Authors: Calum A. Brown, Katarzyna Macieszczak, Robert L. Jack
Abstract: Quantum trajectories of a Markovian open quantum system arise from the back-action of measurements performed in the environment with which the system interacts. In this work, we consider counting measurements of quantum jumps, corresponding to different representations of the same quantum master equation. We derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which these different measurements give rise to the same unravelled quantum master equation, which governs the dynamics of the probability distribution over pure conditional states of the system. Since that equation uniquely determines the stochastic dynamics of a conditional state, we also obtain necessary and sufficient conditions under which different measurements result in identical quantum trajectories. We then consider the joint stochastic dynamics for the conditional state and the measurement record. We formulate this in terms of labelled quantum trajectories, and derive necessary and sufficient conditions under which different representations lead to equivalent labelled quantum trajectories, up to permutations of labels. As those conditions are generally stricter, we finish by constructing coarse-grained measurement records, such that equivalence of the corresponding partially-labelled trajectories is guaranteed by equivalence of the trajectories alone. These general results are illustrated by two examples that demonstrate permutation of labels, and equivalence of different quantum trajectories.

Title: Non-Hermitian Linear Electro-Optic Effect Through Interactions of Free and Bound Charges
Authors: Sylvain Lannebère, Nader Engheta, Mário G. Silveirinha
Abstract: In recent years, there has been significant interest in non-Hermitian phenomena, particularly optical gain, stemming from electro-optic effects. Typically, these effects are attributed to nonlinear interactions arising from the ``anomalous velocity" of Bloch electrons. Here, we introduce a novel mechanism for achieving optical gain through nonlinear interactions between free and bound electrons. We propose a semiclassical phenomenological microscopic model that encompasses a broad spectrum of nonlinear interactions, consistent with passivity and with the principles of microscopic reversibility. Our analysis shows that under non-equilibrium conditions and within low-symmetry systems, the linearized electromagnetic response can display both nonreciprocal and gain properties. We examine the stability of these electrically-biased systems and illustrate their potential applications, including the development of optical isolators and traveling wave amplifiers.

Title: Eigen-SNAP gate for photonic qubits in a cavity-transmon system
Authors: Marcus Meschede, Ludwig Mathey
Abstract: In the pursuit of robust quantum computing, we put forth a platform based on photonic qubits in a circuit-QED environment. Specifically, we propose a versatile two-qubit gate based on two cavities coupled via a transmon, constituting a selective number-dependent phase gate operating on the in-phase eigenmodes of the two cavities, the Eigen-SNAP gate. This gate natively operates in the dispersive coupling regime of the cavities and the transmon, and operates by driving the transmon externally, to imprint desired phases on the number states. As an example for the utility of the Eigen-SNAP gate, we implement a $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$ gate on a system of two logical bosonic qubits encoded in the cavities. Further, we use numerical optimization to determine the optimal implementation of the $\sqrt{\text{SWAP}}$. We find that the fidelities of these optimal protocols are only limited by the coherence times of the system's components. These findings pave the way to continuous variable quantum computing in cavity-transmon systems.

Title: Comparing quantum complexity and quantum fidelity
Authors: Nadir Samos Sáenz de Buruaga
Abstract: Quantum complexity measures the difficulty of obtaining a given state starting from a typically unentangled state. In this work, we show that complexity, when defined through the minimization of a Riemannian cost functional over the manifold of Gaussian states, provides the same information as quantum fidelity and is therefore capable of detecting quantum phase transitions. However, it does not offer a more refined analysis than entanglement entropy for a given state. We conclude that incorporating a notion of spatial locality into the computation of complexity is essential to uncover new physics beyond what is accessible through entanglement entropy and fidelity.

Title: Correlated quasiparticle poisoning from phonon-only events in superconducting qubits
Authors: E. Yelton, C. P. Larson, K. Dodge, K. Okubo, B. L. T. Plourde
Abstract: Throughout multiple cooldowns we observe a power-law reduction in time for the rate of multi-qubit correlated poisoning events, while the rate of shifts in qubit offset-charge remains constant; evidence of a non-ionizing source of pair-breaking phonon bursts for superconducting qubits. We investigate different types of sample packaging, some of which are sensitive to mechanical impacts from the cryocooler pulse tube. One possible source of these events comes from relaxation of thermally-induced stresses from differential thermal contraction between the device layer and substrate.

Title: Quantifying two-mode entanglement of bosonic Gaussian states from their full counting statistics
Authors: Victor Gondret, Clothilde Lamirault, Rui Dias, Charlie Leprince, Christoph I. Westbrook, David Clément, Denis Boiron
Abstract: We study the entanglement properties of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states from their multi-mode counting statistics. We introduce the idea that measuring high-order correlations of particle numbers can reveal entanglement without making any assumptions about the coherence of the fields. In particular, we show that the two- and four-body number correlations are sufficient to fully characterize the entanglement of two-mode bosonic Gaussian states for which each mode exhibits a thermal distribution. In addition, we derive an entanglement witness based on two-body correlations alone. Our findings are of great importance because it becomes possible to reveal entanglement in a series of recent experiments.

Title: Discovering dynamic laws from observations: the case of self-propelled, interacting colloids
Authors: Miguel Ruiz-Garcia, C. Miguel Barriuso G., Lachlan C. Alexander, Dirk G. A. L. Aarts, Luca Ghiringhelli, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Active matter spans a wide range of time and length scales, from groups of cells and synthetic self-propelled particles to schools of fish, flocks of birds, or even human crowds. The theoretical framework describing these systems has shown tremendous success at finding universal phenomenology. However, further progress is often burdened by the difficulty of determining the forces that control the dynamics of the individual elements within each system. Accessing this local information is key to understanding the physics dominating the system and to create the models that can explain the observed collective phenomena. In this work, we present a machine-learning model, a graph neural network, that uses the collective movement of the system to learn the active and two-body forces controlling the individual dynamics of the particles. We verify our approach using numerical simulations of active brownian particles, considering different interaction potentials and levels of activity. Finally, we apply our model to experiments of electrophoretic Janus particles, extracting the active and two-body forces that control the dynamics of the colloids. Due to this, we can uncover the physics dominating the behavior of the system. We extract an active force that depends on the electric field and also area fraction. We also discover a dependence of the two-body interaction with the electric field that leads us to propose that the dominant force between these colloids is a screened electrostatic interaction with a constant length scale. We expect that this methodology can open a new avenue for the study and modeling of experimental systems of active particles.

Title: Quantum critical metals and loss of quasiparticles
Authors: Haoyu Hu, Lei Chen, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Strange metals develop near quantum critical points in a variety of strongly correlated systems. Some of the issues that are central to the field include how the quantum-critical state loses quasiparticles, how it drives superconductivity, and to what extent the strange-metal physics in different classes of correlated systems are interconnected. In this Review, we survey some of these issues from the vantage point of heavy fermion metals. We will describe the notion of Kondo destruction and how it leads to several crucial effects. These include a transformation of the Fermi surface from large to small when the system is tuned across the quantum-critical point, a loss of quasiparticles everywhere on the Fermi surface when it is perched at the quantum-critical point, and a dynamical Planckian scaling in various physical properties including charge responses. We close with a discussion about the connections between the strange-metal physics in heavy fermion metals and its counterparts in the cuprates and other correlated materials.

Title: Observation of increasing bending rigidity of graphene with temperature
Authors: Martin Tømterud, Simen K. Hellner, Sabrina D. Eder, Stiven Forti, Domenica Convertino, Joseph R. Manson, Camilla Coletti, Thomas Frederiksen, Bodil Holst
Abstract: The mechanical properties of two-dimensional materials are important for a wide range of applications including composite and van der Waals-materials, flexible electronics and superconductivity. Several aspects are highly debated in the literature: For example, the theoretically predicted bending rigidity $\kappa$ at 0 K for quasi free-standing graphene varies from 0.8 to 1.6~eV, and there are predictions that it could either increase or decrease with temperature. Here we present an experimental study of the temperature-dependent bending rigidity $\kappa(T)$ of graphene. From the phonon dispersion relation measured with helium atom scattering for the out-of-plane acoustic (ZA) mode, we find $\kappa(T)$ to increase with sample temperature. We compare our experimental results with novel molecular dynamics (MD) simulations performed as part of this study as well as available literature data. The calculations reproduce the temperature trend of our experiments, but with a slightly weaker slope. A probable cause for the observed differences is the slight strain associated with experimental substrate supported graphene that is not present in the calculations.

Title: Persistent, controllable circulation of a polariton ring condensate
Authors: Q. Yao, P. Comaron, H. A. Alnatah, J. Beaumariage, S. Mukherjee, K. West, L. Pfeiffer, K. Baldwin, M. Szymańska, D. W. Snoke
Abstract: Persistent circulation is a canonical effect of superfluidity. In previous experiments, quantized circulation has been observed in polariton condensates, usually far from equilibrium, but persistent current in the absence of any stirring has not been seen. We report here the direct observation of persistent circulation of a polariton condensate with no driving force and with no observable change in time. We can cause the condensate to circulate in either direction on demand using a short laser pulse, after which the condensate continues to circulate for dozens to hundreds of rotations around a ring trap without any further stimulation. Our theoretical model successfully shows how the pulse, despite not carrying any angular momentum, causes the circulation.

Title: Quantization Condition of the Bound States in $n$th-order Schrödinger equations
Authors: Xiong Fan
Abstract: We prove a general approximate quantization rule $ \int_{L_{E}}^{R_{E}}k_0(x)$ $dx=(N+\frac{1}{2})\pi $ or $ \oint k_0(x)$ $dx=(2N+1)\pi $ (including both forward and backward processes) for the bound states in the potential well of the $n$th-order Schrödinger equations $ e^{-i\pi n/2}{{}\frac{d^n\Psi(x)}{d x^n} } =[E-{} V(x)]\Psi(x) ,$ where ${} k_0(x)=(E-V(x) )^{1/n}$ with $N\in\mathbb{N}_{0} $, $n$ is an even natural number, and $L_{E}$ and $R_{E}$ the boundary points between the classically forbidden regions and the allowed region. The only hypothesis is that all exponentially growing components are negligible, which is appropriate for not narrow wells. Applications including the Schrödinger equation and Bogoliubov-de Gennes equation will be discussed.

Title: The coupled-cluster self-energy
Authors: Christopher J. N. Coveney, David P. Tew
Abstract: Coupled-cluster and Green's function theories are highly successful in treating many-body electron correlation and there has been significant interest in identifying and leveraging connections between them. Here we present a diagrammatic definition of the irreducible coupled-cluster self-energy that directly embeds coupled-cluster theory within the framework of many-body field theory. The EOM-CC treatment emerges naturally from our definition via the Dyson and Bethe-Salpeter equations, providing a unified description of RPA, $GW$-BSE and CC theory for ground state and excitation energies. This clarifies the origin of previously established connections between RPA, $GW$-BSE and coupled-cluster theory, and exposes the relationship between vertex corrections and the coupled-cluster amplitude equations.

Title: Protected Fermionic Zero Modes in Periodic Gauge Fields
Authors: Vo Tien Phong, Eugene J. Mele
Abstract: It is well-known that macroscopically-normalizable zero-energy wavefunctions of spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ particles in a two-dimensional inhomogeneous magnetic field are spin-polarized and exactly calculable with degeneracy equaling the number of flux quanta linking the whole system. Extending this argument to massless Dirac fermions subjected to magnetic fields that have \textit{zero} net flux but are doubly periodic in real space, we show that there exist \textit{only two} Bloch-normalizable zero-energy eigenstates, one for each spin flavor. This result is immediately relevant to graphene multilayer systems subjected to doubly-periodic strain fields, which at low energies, enter the Hamiltonian as periodic pseudo-gauge vector potentials. Furthermore, we explore various related settings including nonlinearly-dispersing band structure models and systems with singly-periodic magnetic fields.

Title: Probing quantum properties of black holes with a Floquet-driven optical lattice simulator
Authors: Asmae Benhemou, Georgia Nixon, Aydin Deger, Ulrich Schneider, Jiannis K. Pachos
Abstract: In the curved spacetime of a black hole, quantum physics gives rise to distinctive effects such as Hawking radiation and maximally fast scrambling. Here, we present a scheme for an analogue quantum simulation of (1 + 1) and (2 + 1)-dimensional black holes using ultracold atoms in a locally Floquet-driven optical lattice. We show how the effective dynamics of the driven system can generate position-dependent tunnelling amplitudes that encode the curved geometry of the black hole. Moreover, we provide a simple and robust scheme to determine the Hawking temperature of a (1+1)D simulated black hole based solely on on-site atom population measurements. Combined with the highly tunable onsite atom-atom interactions typical for cold atoms, our simulator provides a powerful and feasible platform to probe the scrambling of quantum information in black holes. We illustrate the ergodicity of our (2+1)D black-hole simulator by showing numerically that its level statistics in the hard-core limit approaches the ergodic regime faster than a globally homogeneous Hamiltonian.

Title: Mirror Chern Bands and Weyl Nodal Loops in Altermagnets
Authors: Daniil S. Antonenko, Rafael M. Fernandes, Jorn W. F. Venderbos
Abstract: The electronic spectra of altermagnets are a fertile ground for nontrivial topology due to the unique interplay between time-reversal and crystalline symmetries. This is reflected in the unconventional Zeeman splitting between bands of opposite spins, which emerges in the absence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and displays nodes along high-symmetry directions. Here, we argue that even for a small SOC, the direction of the magnetic moments in the altermagnetic state has a profound impact on the electronic spectrum, enabling novel topological phenomena to appear. By investigating microscopic models for two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) altermagnets, motivated in part by rutile materials, we demonstrate the emergence of hitherto unexplored Dirac crossings between bands of the same spin but opposite sublattices. The direction of the moments determines the fate of these crossings when the SOC is turned on. We focus on the case of out-of-plane moments, which forbid an anomalous Hall effect and thus ensure that no weak magnetization is triggered in the altermagnetic state. In the 2D model, the SOC gaps out the Dirac crossings, resulting in mirror Chern bands that enable the Quantum Spin Hall Effect and undergo a topological transition to trivial bands upon increasing the magnitude of the magnetic moment. On the other hand, in the 3D model the crossings persist even in the presence of SOC, forming Weyl nodal loops protected by mirror symmetry. Finally, we discuss possible ways to control these effects in altermagnetic material candidates.

Title: Polar Nematic Phases with Enantiotropic Ferro- and Antiferroelectric Behavior
Authors: Mateusz Mrukiewicz, Michał Czerwiński, Natalia Podoliak, Dalibor Repček, Paweł Perkowski, Richard. J. Mandle, Dorota Węgłowska
Abstract: The recent discovery of a new ferroelectric nematic (NF) liquid crystalline phase became of utmost interest for the liquid crystal (LC) and the whole soft and condensed matter fields. Contrary to the previously known ferroelectric LC materials, whose ferroelectric characteristics were much weaker, new polar nematics exhibit properties comparable to solid ferroelectrics. This discovery brought about tremendous efforts to further explore compounds showing these phases, and fascinating physical properties have been reported. Herein, we present the first synthesized compounds with the enantiotropic ferro- (NF) and antiferroelectric (NX) nematic phases. The enantiotropic nature and an unprecedentedly broad temperature range of NF and NX phases are confirmed by various experimental techniques: polarized-light optical microscopy (POM) observations, different scanning calorimetry (DSC), dielectric spectroscopy, second harmonic generation (SHG), and molecular modeling. The presented achievements in designing achiral compounds that exhibit enantiotropic polar nematic phases with ferro- and antiferroelectric properties significantly contribute to the development of multicomponent mixtures with a broad temperature range of NF and NX phases down to room temperature. Furthermore, this accomplishment considerably enhances the general understanding of the structural correlations that promote polar nematic liquid crystal phases with high thermodynamic stability. Finally, this work may benefit various applications in photonic devices.

Title: Experimental observation of gapped shear waves and liquid-like to gas-like dynamical crossover in active granular matter
Authors: Cunyuan Jiang, Zihan Zheng, Yangrui Chen, Matteo Baggioli, Jie Zhang
Abstract: Unlike crystalline solids, liquids lack long-range order, resulting in diffusive shear fluctuations rather than propagating waves. Simulations predict that liquids exhibit a $k$-gap in wave-vector space, where solid-like transverse waves reappear above this gap. Experimental evidence in classical liquids has been limited, observed only in 2D dusty plasmas. Here, we investigate this phenomenon using active Brownian vibrators and uncover distinct gas-like and liquid-like phases depending on the packing fraction. We measure key properties, including pair correlation functions, mean square displacements, velocity auto-correlation functions, and vibrational density of states. In the liquid-like phase, we confirm the $k$-gap in transverse excitations, whose size grows as the packing fraction decreases and eventually disappears in the gas phase. Our findings extend the concept of the $k$-gap to active granular systems and reveal striking parallels with supercritical fluids.

Title: Fractionalization Signatures in the Dynamics of Quantum Spin Liquids
Authors: Kang Wang, Shi Feng, Penghao Zhu, Runze Chi, Hai-Jun Liao, Nandini Trivedi, Tao Xiang
Abstract: We investigate the signatures of fractionalization in quantum spin liquids by studying different phases of the Kitaev honeycomb model in the presence of an out-of-plane magnetic field through which the model becomes non-integrable. Using the infinite projected entangled pair states (iPEPS) ansatz, along with analytical calculations and exact diagonalization, we calculate dynamical signatures of fractionalized particles through spin-spin and dimer-dimer correlations. Our analysis demonstrates the ability of these correlations to discern distinct fractionalized quantum sectors, namely Majorana fermions and the emergent $Z_2$ fluxes, in both the chiral spin liquid (CSL) phase under weak field and the emergent intermediate gapless phase (IGP) under moderate field. Importantly, our calculation reveals the nature of IGP observed at moderate fields, a region of ongoing debate, indicating that this phase is a Majorana metal induced by strong flux fluctuations.

Title: Thermodynamics of Non-Hermitian Josephson junctions with exceptional points
Authors: D. Michel Pino, Yigal Meir, Ramón Aguado
Abstract: We present an analytical formulation of the thermodynamics, free energy and entropy, of any generic Bogoliubov de Genes model which develops exceptional point (EP) bifurcations in its complex spectrum when coupled to reservoirs. We apply our formalism to a non-Hermitian Josephson junction where, despite recent claims, the supercurrent does not exhibit any divergences at EPs. The entropy, on the contrary, shows a universal jump of $1/2\log 2$ which can be linked to the emergence of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) at EPs. Our method allows us to obtain precise analytical boundaries for the temperatures at which such Majorana entropy steps appear. We propose a generalized Maxwell relation linking supercurrents and entropy which could pave the way towards the direct experimental observation of such steps in e.g. quantum-dot based minimal Kitaev chains.

Title: Survival probability and position distribution of a run and tumble particle in $U(x)=α|x|$ potential with an absorbing boundary
Authors: Sujit Kumar Nath, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study the late time exponential decay of the survival probability $S_\pm(t,a|x_0)\sim e^{-\theta(a)t}$, of a one-dimensional run and tumble particle starting from $x_0<a$ with an initial orientation $\sigma(0)=\pm 1$, under a confining potential $U(x)=\alpha|x|$ with an absorbing boundary at $x=a>0$. We find that the decay rate $\theta(a)$ of the survival probability has strong dependence on the location $a$ of the absorbing boundary, which undergoes a freezing transition at a critical value $a=a_c=(v_0-\alpha)\sqrt{v_0^2-\alpha^2}/(2\alpha\gamma)$, where $v_0>\alpha$ is the self-propulsion speed and $\gamma$ is the tumbling rate of the particle. For $a>a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ increases monotonically from zero, as $a$ decreases from infinity, till it attains the maximum value $\theta(a_c)$ at $a=a_c$. For $0<a<a_c$, the value of $\theta(a)$ freezes to the value $\theta(a)=\theta(a_c)$. We also obtain the propagator with the absorbing boundary condition at $x=a$. Our analytical results are supported by numerical simulations.

Title: Atomistic theory of twist-angle dependent intralayer and interlayer exciton properties in twisted bilayer materials
Authors: Indrajit Maity, Arash A. Mostofi, Johannes Lischner
Abstract: Twisted bilayers of two-dimensional (2D) materials have emerged as a highly tunable platform to study and engineer properties of excitons. However, the atomistic description of these properties has remained a significant challenge as a consequence of the large unit cells of the emergent moiré superlattices. To address this problem, we introduce an efficient approach to solve the Bethe-Salpeter equation that exploits the localization of atomic Wannier functions. We then use this approach to study intra- and interlayer excitons in twisted WS$_{2}$/WSe$_{2}$ at a range of twist angles. In agreement with experiment, we find that the optical spectrum exhibits three low-energy peaks for twist angles small than $2^\circ$. The energy splitting between the peaks is described accurately. We also find two low-energy interlayer excitons with weak oscillator strengths. Our approach opens up new opportunities for the design of light-matter interactions in ultrathin materials.

Title: Symmetry classes of classical stochastic processes
Authors: Lucas Sá, Pedro Ribeiro, Tomaž Prosen, Denis Bernard
Abstract: We perform a systematic symmetry classification of the Markov generators of classical stochastic processes. Our classification scheme is based on the action of involutive symmetry transformations of a real Markov generator, extending the Bernard-LeClair scheme to the arena of classical stochastic processes and leading to a set of up to fifteen allowed symmetry classes. We construct families of solutions of arbitrary matrix dimensions for five of these classes with a simple physical interpretation of particles hopping on multipartite graphs. In the remaining classes, such a simple construction is prevented by the positivity of entries of the generator particular to classical stochastic processes, which imposes a further requirement beyond the usual symmetry classification constraints. We partially overcome this difficulty by resorting to a stochastic optimization algorithm, finding specific examples of generators of small matrix dimensions in six further classes, leaving the existence of the final four allowed classes an open problem. Our symmetry-based results unveil new possibilities in the dynamics of classical stochastic processes: Kramers degeneracy of eigenvalue pairs, dihedral symmetry of the spectra of Markov generators, and time reversal properties of stochastic trajectories and correlation functions.

Title: DFT+DMFT study of correlated electronic structure in the monolayer-trilayer phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Zhenfeng Ouyang, Jia-Ming Wang, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: By preforming DFT+DMFT calculations, we systematically investigate the correlated electronic structure in the newly discovered monolayer-trilayer (ML-TL) phase of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ (1313-La327). Our calculated Fermi surfaces are in good agreement with the result of angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy. We find that 1313-La327 is a multiorbital correlated metal. An orbital-selective Mott behavior is found in ML in our zero- and finite-temperature calculations. The ML Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbital exhibits a Mott behavior, while the ML Ni-3$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital is metallic due to self-doping. We also find a large static local spin susceptibility of ML Ni, suggesting that there is large spin fluctuation in 1313-La327. The TL Ni-$e_g$ orbitals possess similar electronic correlation to those in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$. The $e_g$ orbitals of the outer-layer Ni in TL show non-Fermi liquid behaviors. Besides, large weight of high-spin states are found in TL-outer Ni and ML Ni, implying Hundness. Under 16 GPa, a Lifshitz transition is revealed by our calculations and a La-related band crosses the Fermi level. Our work provides a theoretical reference for studying other potential mixed-stacked nickelate superconductors.

Title: A charge transfer mechanism for optically addressable solid-state spin pairs
Authors: Islay O. Robertson, Benjamin Whitefield, Sam C. Scholten, Priya Singh, Alexander J. Healey, Philipp Reineck, Mehran Kianinia, Gergely Barcza, Viktor Ivády, David A. Broadway, Igor Aharonovich, Jean-Philippe Tetienne
Abstract: Optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) with no resolvable zero-field splitting has been observed from emitters in hexagonal boron nitride across a broad range of wavelengths, but so far an understanding of their microscopic structure and the physical origin of ODMR has been lacking. Here we perform comprehensive measurements and modelling of the spin-resolved photodynamics of ensembles and single emitters, and uncover a universal model that accounts, and provides an intuitive physical explanation, for all key experimental features. The model, inspired by the radical-pair mechanism from spin chemistry, assumes a pair of nearby point defects -- a primary optically active defect and a secondary defect. Charge transfer between the two defects creates a metastable weakly coupled spin pair with ODMR naturally arising from selection rules. Using first-principle calculations, we show that simple defect pairs made of common carbon defects provide a plausible microscopic explanation. Our optical-spin defect pair (OSDP) model resolves several previously open questions including the asymmetric envelope of the Rabi oscillations, the large variability in ODMR contrast amplitude and sign, and the wide spread in emission wavelength. It may also explain similar phenomena observed in other wide bandgap semiconductors such as GaN. The presented framework will be instrumental in guiding future theoretical and experimental efforts to study and engineer solid-state spin pairs.

Title: Scaling laws for velocity profile of granular flow in rotating drums
Authors: Hiroki Oba, Michio Otsuki
Abstract: We numerically analyze the steady flow of two-dimensional granular materials in a rotating drum using the discrete element method and a continuum model. The velocity fields obtained from both methods are quantitatively consistent. Two distinct regions exist in the granular flow: the surface flow layer and the static flow regime associated with the rigid rotation near the bottom. The thickness of the surface flow layer increases with the drum diameter and shows a slight dependence on the angular velocity of the rotating drum. We derived scaling laws for the velocity profile and surface layer thickness using dimensional analysis applied to the continuum equations. The validity of the scaling laws is confirmed numerically.

Title: Dynamically emergent correlations in bosons via quantum resetting
Authors: Manas Kulkarni, Satya N. Majumdar, Sanjib Sabhapandit
Abstract: We study the nonequilibrium stationary state (NESS) induced by quantum resetting of a system of $N$ noninteracting bosons in a harmonic trap. Our protocol consists of preparing initially the system in the ground state of a harmonic oscillator centered at $+a$, followed by a rapid quench where the center is shifted to $-a$ and the system is allowed to evolve unitarily up to a random Poissonian time $\tau$ distributed via $r\, e^{-r \tau}$. Then the trap center is reset to $+a$ again and the system is assumed to cool instantaneously to the initial ground state. The system is again allowed to evolve unitarily in the trap centered at $-a$ up to a random time, and the procedure is repeated. Under repeated resetting, the system reaches a NESS where the positions of bosons get strongly correlated due to simultaneous resetting induced by the trap. We fully characterize the steady state by analytically computing several physical observables such as the average density, extreme value statistics, order and gap statistics, and also the distribution of the number of particles in a region $[-L,L]$, known as the full counting statistics (FCS). In particular, we show that in the large $N$ limit, the scaling function describing the FCS exhibits a striking feature: it is supported over a nontrivial finite interval, and moreover is discontinuous at an interior point of the support. Our results are supported by numerical simulations. This is a rare example of a strongly correlated quantum many-body NESS where various observables can be exactly computed.

Title: Responses of any arbitrary initially stressed reference and the stress-free reference
Authors: Soumya Mukherjee
Abstract: The constitutive relation for an initially stressed reference is often determined by using the response of a virtual stress-free reference. However, identifying the constitutive relation of the original stress-free body can be challenging without conducting destructive tests. This paper presents three approaches for determining the response of a stress-free reference -- or any arbitrary initially stressed reference -- when the response of a particular initially stressed reference is known. Unlike standard practice, these approaches of changing reference configurations do not begin with a known stress-free state. The first and third approaches directly derive the constitutive relations of one stressed reference from another. {The first approach is applicable to a specific constitutive relation of the known initially stressed state,} while the third approach extends the first and is applicable to any constitutive form. The second approach uses any general response of a given stressed reference to identify the stress-free material. The response of the stress-free material is further analyzed and processed to determine the response of any stressed reference. We observe that even when the known initially stressed state is Green elastic, the arbitrarily stressed or stress-free references may exhibit implicit elasticity.

Title: A numerical study of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on strips of width $k$
Authors: Soumyadeep Sarma
Abstract: We study numerically, the distribution of the zeros of the grand partition function of $k$-mers on a $k \times L$ strip in the complex activity (z) plane. Using transfer matrix methods, we find that our results match the analytical predictions of Heilmann and Leib for $k = 2$. However, for $k = 3$, the zeros are confined within a bounded region, suggesting a fundamental difference in critical behavior. This indicates that trimers belong to a distinct universality class in some finite geometries. We observe that the density of zeros along multiple line segments in the complex plane reveals a richer structure than in the dimer case. {Our findings emphasize the role of geometric constraints in shaping the statistical mechanics of $k$-mer models and set the stage for further studies in higher-dimensional lattices.

Title: Space-time Supercrystals from Non-Abelian Electric Translation Symmetries
Authors: Jian Wang, James Jun He, Qian Niu
Abstract: Electronic supercrystals can form in spatial or temporal dimensions where traditional mechanisms usually require many-body interactions, such as Wigner crystals or discrete time crystals. We propose a novel approach for electronic supercrystals in 1+1D without requiring many-body interactions, but arising from the competition between characteristic space-time areas in periodically driven Su-Schrieffer-Heeger lattices under electric fields. Utilizing the non-Abelian dynamical symmetries described by the electric translation group, the area competition is characterized by fractal spectra and replicated bands, furnished with eigenstates crystallized in enlarged space-time unit cells forming space-time supercrystals under perturbations. We also report robust dynamical localization of electrons arising from the static topology of the SSH lattice.

Title: Effective K Valley Hamiltonian for Twisted TMDs which Exhibit Pressure Dependent Topological Phase Transitions
Authors: Miftah Hadi Syahputra Anfa, Sabri Elatresh, Hocine Bahlouli, Michael Vogl
Abstract: Motivated by recent studies on topologically nontrivial moiré bands in twisted bilayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer systems subject to pressure, which is applied perpendicular to the material surface. We start our investigation by first considering untwisted bilayer systems with an arbitrary relative shift between layers; a symmetry analysis for this case permits us to obtain a simplified effective low-energy Hamiltonian valid near the important $\mathbf{K}$ valley region of the Brillouin zone. Ab initio density functional theory (DFT) was then employed to obtain relaxed geometric structures for pressures within the range of 0.0 - 3.5 GPa and corresponding band structures. The DFT data was then fitted to the low-energy Hamiltonian to obtain a pressure-dependent Hamiltonian. We then could model a twisted system by treating the twist as a position-dependent shift between layers. In summary, this approach allowed us to obtain the explicit analytical expressions for a Hamiltonian that describes a twisted MoTe\textsubscript{2} bilayer under pressure. Our Hamiltonian then permitted us to study the impact of pressure on the band topology of the twisted system. As a result, we identified many pressure-induced topological phase transitions as indicated by changes in valley Chern numbers. Moreover, we found that pressure could be employed to flatten bands in some of the cases we considered.

Title: Crystal valley Hall effect
Authors: Chao-Yang Tan, Ze-Feng Gao, Huan-Cheng Yang, Zheng-Xin Liu, Kai Liu, Peng-Jie Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: The time-reversal symmetry is thought to be a necessary condition for realizing valley Hall effect. If the time-reversal symmetry is broken, whether the valley Hall effect can be realized has not been explored. In this letter, based on symmetry analysis and the first-principles electronic structure calculations, we demonstrate that the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry can be realized in two-dimensional altermagnetic materials Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$. Due to crystal symmetry required, the vally Hall effect without time-reversal symmetry is called crystal vally Hall effect. In addition, under uniaxial strain, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ can realize piezomagnetic effect. Under biaxial compressive stress, both monolayer Fe$_2$WSe$_4$ and Fe$_2$WS$_4$ will transform from altermagnetic semiconductor phase to bipolarized topological Weyl semimetal phase. Our work not only provides a new direction for exploring the novel valley Hall effect, but also provides a good platform for exploring altermagnetic semiconductors and altermagnetic topological phase transitions.

Abstract: The quasiparticle relaxation dynamics of the iron-based superconductor CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ ($T_c$ $\sim$ 29 K) were investigated using ultrafast optical spectroscopy. A pseudogap ($\Delta_{PG}$ $\approx$ 3.3 meV) was observed to open below $T^{\ast}$ $\approx$ 60 K, prior to the emergence of a superconducting gap ($\Delta$ $\approx$ 6.6 $\pm$ 0.4 meV). At high excitation fluence, a coherent A1g phonon mode at 5.49 THz was identified, exhibiting deviations from anharmonic behavior below $T_c$. The electron-phonon coupling constant for this mode was estimated to be $\lambda_{A_{1g}}$ $\approx$ 0.23. These results provide insights into the interplay between the electron-phonon interactions, pseudogap, and the superconducting pairing mechanism in CsCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$.

Title: Anomalous conductance steps in three-dimensional topological insulator HgTe-based quantum point contacts
Authors: Elisabeth Richter, Michael Barth, Dmitriy A. Kozlov, Angelika Knothe, Nikolay N. Mikhailov, Juliane Steidl, Cosimo Gorini, Stefan Hartl, Wolfgang Himmler, Klaus Richter, Dieter Weiss
Abstract: We explore electrical transport through a point contact in strained HgTe, a three-dimensional topological insulator. In the absence of a magnetic field $B$, there is no quantization. However, under higher magnetic fields, we observe distinct non-integer conductance steps. Based on numerical tight-binding calculations and a phenomenological Landauer-Büttiker approach, we attribute these atypical, non-integer quantized plateaus to significant scattering effects at the point contact.

Title: Long-range hopping in a quasiperiodic potential weakens the non-Hermitian skin effect
Authors: Dechi Peng, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate a non-Hermitian Aubry-André-Harper model characterized by power-law hoppings ($1/s^{a}$) and a quasi-periodic parameter $\beta$, where $a$ denotes the power-law index, $s$ represents the hopping distance, and $\beta$ belongs to the metallic mean family. In the intermediate phases, we find that ergodic states correspond to complex eigenvalues, multifractal states to real eigenvalues, and localized states may exhibit either complex or real eigenvalues. Moreover, both real and complex energy spectra emerge in the localized phase, with real spectra attributed to pseudo-Hermiticity. Under open boundary conditions, our analysis of fractal dimensions and eigenstates reveals that all ergodic states transform into skin states. Furthermore, we demonstrate that long-range hoppings weaken the skin effect, offering another perspective for exploring non-Hermitian skin effects.

Title: Effects of Spin-Orbit Coupling and Thermal Expansion on the Phonon-limited Resistivity of Pb from First Principles
Authors: Félix Antoine Goudreault, Samuel Poncé, Feliciano Giustino, Michel Côté
Abstract: Using density functional theory calculations with spin-orbit coupling (SOC), we report on the temperature-dependent thermodynamical properties of Pb: electrical resistivity, thermal expansion (TE), heat capacity, bulk modulus and its pressure derivative. For the former, we employed the state-of-the-art ab initio Boltzmann Transport Equation formalism, and we calculated the effect of TE. In accordance with previous work, we show that SOC improves the description of the phonon dispersion and the resistivity. We argue that this is caused by a joint mutual effect of an increase in the electronic nesting and an increase in the electron-phonon coupling. Interestingly, including TE incorporates non-linearity into the resistivity at high temperatures, whose magnitude depends on whether SOC is included or not. We suggest that mechanisms beyond the quasi-harmonic approximation should be considered to get a better description of Pb with SOC at high temperatures.

Title: Two-spinon effects on the thermal Tonks-Girardeau gas
Authors: Felipe Taha Sant'Ana, Hui Liu
Abstract: We study the effects of the two-spinon excitations on the field-field correlator of the Tonks-Girardeau gas at thermal equilibrium. Recently, such excitations were investigated for the ground state of the system, and discovered that they prevail for evaluating the one-body correlation function of the infinitely repulsive Lieb-Liniger model. Here we extend it for finite temperatures.

Title: Quantum transport in an ambipolar InSb nanowire quantum dot device
Authors: Mingtang Deng, Chunlin Yu, Guangyao Huang, P. Caroff, H. Q. Xu
Abstract: Semiconductor InSb nanowires present a highly intriguing platform with immense potential for applications in spintronics and topological quantum devices. The narrow band gap exhibited by InSb allows for precise tuning of these nanowires, facilitating smooth transitions between the electron transport region and the hole transport region. In this study, we demonstrate quantum transport measurements obtained from a high-quality InSb nanowire quantum dot device. By utilizing a back gate, this device can be adjusted from an electron-populated quantum dot regime to a hole-populated one. Within both regimes, we have observed dozens of consecutive quantum levels without any charge rearrangement or impurity-induced interruptions. Our investigations in the electron transport regime have explored phenomena such as Coulomb blockade effect, Zeeman effect,and Kondo effect. Meanwhile, in the hole-transport regime, we have identified conductance peaks induced by lead states. Particularly, we have created a tomographic analysis method of these lead states by tracking the behavior of these conductance peaks across consecutive Coulomb diamond structures.

Title: Altermagnetism: an unconventional spin-ordered phase of matter
Authors: T. Jungwirth, R. M. Fernandes, E. Fradkin, A. H. MacDonald, J. Sinova, L. Smejkal
Abstract: The Pauli exclusion principle combined with interactions between fermions is a basic mechanism across condensed-matter systems giving rise to a spontaneous breaking of the spin-space rotation symmetry of spin-ordered phases. Ferromagnetism is a conventional manifestation of spin ordering which leads to numerous applications, e.g., in spintronic information technologies. Altermagnetism, whose recent discovery was largely motivated by spintronics, stands apart from conventional magnetism in the sense that it spontaneously breaks not only spin-space but also real-space rotation symmetries, while it preserves a symmetry combining spin-space and real-space rotations. This is realized on crystals by a collinear compensated ordering of spins with a characteristic d, g or i-wave symmetry. Our Perspective goes beyond the theory of spin arrangements on crystals by connecting altermagnetism to basic notions in condensed matter physics. Specifically, we reflect on the analogies and distinctions of altermagnetism as compared to superfluid 3He and theories of spin ordering in the momentum space generated by other higher-partial-wave instabilities of a Fermi-liquid. On one hand, all these physical systems have in common the extraordinary combination of spontaneous breaking of spin-space and real-space rotation symmetries. On the other hand, we point out that there are key differences, both at the symmetry level and, particularly, at the level of microscopic mechanisms of ordering. These explain the comparatively large abundance, robustness and utility of altermagnetism, as predicted by the symmetry-classification of spin arrangements on crystals and ab initio calculations, and supported by initial experiments.

Title: Vibrational similarities in jamming-unjamming of polycrystalline and disordered granular packings
Authors: Juan C. Petit, Saswati Ganguly, Matthias Sperl
Abstract: We investigate the vibrational properties of polycrystalline monodisperse and disordered bidisperse granular packings during jamming and unjamming using discrete element method simulations. Both systems deviate from Debye scaling at low frequencies $(\omega)$, but only bidisperse packings exhibit a low-$\omega$ plateau. The low $\omega$ exponent ($\alpha$) in bidisperse packings evolves smoothly from zero (plateau) to near one (Debye scaling) with increasing packing fraction, whereas in polycrystalline packings, it changes discontinuously near jamming/unjamming, due to the nature of the contact network rearrangements. Despite structural modifications during the compression-decompression cycle, the exponent remains unchanged at the same packing fractions, regardless of the history. Nonaffine displacements and contact orientational order further confirm that structural features that impact low-$\omega$ vibrational states and, hence, mechanical properties are largely restored upon decompression, reinforcing vibrational similarities between jamming and unjamming states.

Title: Coexistence of unconventional spin Hall effect and antisymmetric planar Hall effect in IrO$_2$
Authors: Yifei Yang, Sreejith Nair, Yihong Fan, Yu-Chia Chen, Qi Jia, Onri Jay Benally, Seungjun Lee, Seung Gyo Jeong, Zhifei Yang, Tony Low, Bharat Jalan, Jian-Ping Wang
Abstract: Crystal symmetry plays an important role in the Hall effects. Unconventional spin Hall effect (USHE), characterized by Dresselhaus and out-of-plane spins, has been observed in materials with low crystal symmetry. Recently, antisymmetric planar Hall effect (APHE) was discovered in rutile RuO2 and IrO2 (101) thin films, which also exhibit low crystal symmetry. In this study, we report the observation of both USHE and APHE in IrO2 (111) films, using spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance (ST-FMR) and harmonic Hall measurements, respectively. Notably, the unconventional spin torque efficiency from Dresselhaus spin was more than double that of a previous report. Additionally, the temperature dependence of APHE suggests that it arises from the Lorentz force, constrained by crystal symmetry. Symmetry analysis supports the coexistence of USHE and APHE and demonstrates that both originate from the crystal symmetry of IrO2 (111), paving the way for a deeper understanding of Hall effects and related physical phenomena.

Title: Thermoelectric effect in a superconductor with Bogoliubov Fermi surfaces
Authors: Tomoya Sano, Takumi Sato, Akihiro Sasaki, Satoshi Ikegaya, Shingo Kobayashi, Yasuhiro Asano
Abstract: We study theoretically the thermoelectric effect in a superconducting state having the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces which stays in a thin superconducting layer between a conventional superconductor and an insulator. The thermoelectric coefficients calculated based on the linear response theory show the remarkable anisotropy in real space, which are explained well by the anisotropic shape of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surface in momentum space. Our results indicate a way to check the existence of the Bogoliubov-Fermi surfaces in a stable superconducting state because the anisotropy is controlled by the direction of an applied magnetic field.

Title: Origin of $A$-type antiferromagnetism and chiral Split Magnons in altermagnetic $α$-MnTe
Authors: Mojtaba Alaei, Pawel Sobieszczyk, Andrzej Ptok, Nafise Rezaei, Artem R. Oganov, Alireza Qaiumzadeh
Abstract: The origin of the $A$-type antiferromagnetic ordering, characterized by ferromagnetic layers coupling antiferromagnetically, in the prototype semiconductor altermagnet $\alpha$-MnTe has been a topic of ongoing debate. Experimentally, $\alpha$-MnTe exhibits an in-plane ferromagnetic exchange interaction, whereas previous \emph{ab initio} calculations predicted an antiferromagnetic interaction. In this paper, we resolve this discrepancy by considering an expanded set of magnetic configurations, which reveals a ferromagnetic in-plane exchange interaction in agreement with experimental findings. Additionally, we demonstrate that the 10th nearest-neighbor exchange interaction is directionally dependent, inducing a nonrelativistic chiral splitting in the magnon bands, as recently observed experimentally. We further show that applying a compressive strain may significantly enhance both nonrelativistic spin and chiral magnon splittings. The strain can also change the sign of the in-plane exchange interaction. Computing magnetic susceptibility, we show that strain enhances the N{é}el temperature, significantly. Our results highlight the critical importance of convergence in the number of magnetic configurations for spin interactions in antiferromagnetic materials.

Title: Shift spin photocurrents in two-dimensional systems
Authors: Hsiu-Chuan Hsu, Tsung-Wei Chen
Abstract: The generation of nonlinear spin photocurrents by circularly polarized light in two-dimensional systems is theoretically investigated by calculating the shift spin conductivities. In time-reversal symmetric systems, shift spin photocurrent can be generated under the irradiation of circularly polarized light , while the shift charge photoccurrent is forbidden by symmetry. We show that the $k$-cubic Rashba-Dresselhaus system, the $k$-cubic wurtzite system and Dirac surface states can support the shift spin photocurrent. By symmetry analysis, it is found that in the Rashba type spin-orbit coupled systems, mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent be parallel, which we name longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. The Dirac surface states with warping term exhibit mirror symmetry, similar to the Rashba type system, and support longitudinal shift spin photocurrent. In contrast, in the Dresselhaus type spin-orbit coupled systems, the parity-mirror symmetry requires that the spin polarization and the moving direction of the spin photocurrent be perpendicular, which we dub transverse shift spin photocurrent. Furthermore, we find that the shift spin photocurrent always vanishes in any $k$-linear spin-orbit coupled system unless the Zeeman coupling is turned on. We find that the splitting of degenerate energy bands due to Zeeman coupling $\mu_z$ causes the van Hove singularity. The resulting shift spin conductivity has a significant peak at optical frequency $\omega=2\mu_z/\hbar$.

Title: Asymptotic methods for confined fluids
Authors: Emmanuel di Bernardo, Joseph Brader
Abstract: The thermodynamics and microstructure of confined fluids with small particle number are best described using the canonical ensemble. However, practical calculations can usually only be performed in the grand-canonical ensemble, which can introduce unphysical artifacts. We employ the method of asymptotics to transform grand-canonical observables to the canonical ensemble, where the former can be conveniently obtained using the classical density functional theory of inhomogeneous fluids. By formulating the ensemble transformation as a contour integral in the complex fugacity plane we reveal the influence of the Yang-Lee zeros in determining the form and convergence properties of the asymptotic series. The theory is employed to develop expansions for the canonical partition function and the canonical one-body density. Numerical investigations are then performed using an exactly soluble one-dimensional model system of hard-rods.

Title: Microscopic Theory of Polaron-Polariton Dispersion and Propagation
Authors: Logan Blackham, Arshath Manjalingal, Saeed R. Koshkaki, Arkajit Mandal
Abstract: We develop an analytical microscopic theory to describe the polaron-polariton dispersion, formed by hybridizing excitons, photons, and phonons, and their coherent dynamics inside optical cavities. Starting from a microscopic light-matter Hamiltonian, we derive a simple analytical model by pursuing a non-perturbative treatment of the phonon and photon couplings to excitons. Within our theoretical framework, the phonons are treated as classical fields that are then quantized via the Floquet formalism. We show that, to a good approximation, the entire polaron-polariton system can be described using a band picture despite the phonons breaking translational symmetry. Our theory also sheds light on the long-lived coherent ballistic motion of exciton-polaritons with high excitonic character that propagate with group velocities lower than is expected from pure exciton-polariton bands, offering a microscopic explanation for these puzzling experimental observations.

Title: Spontaneous Twist of Ferroelectric Smectic Blocks in Polar Fluids
Authors: Hiroya Nishikawa, Yasushi Okumura, Dennis Kwaria, Atsuko Nihonyanagi, Fumito Araoka
Abstract: In soft matter, the polar orientational order of molecules can facilitate the coexistence of structural chirality and ferroelectricity. The ferroelectric nematic (NF) state, exhibited by achiral calamitic molecules with large dipole moments, serves as an ideal model for the emergence of spontaneous structural chirality. This chiral ground state arises from a left- or right-handed twist of polarization due to depolarization effects. In contrast, the ferroelectric smectic state, characterized by a polar lamellar structure with lower symmetry, experiences significantly higher energy associated with layer-twisting deformations and the formation of domain walls, thus avoiding a continuously twisted layered structure. In this study, we develop two types of achiral molecules (BOE-NO2 and DIOLT) that possess different molecular structure but exhibit a NF-ferroelectric smectic phase sequence. We demonstrate that the chiral ground state of NF is inherited in the ferroelectric smectic phases of BOE-NO2, which features larger dipole moments and a steric hindrance moiety, thereby triggering the formation of the twisted polar smectic blocks.

Title: Interlayer interactions in $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under pressure: from $s^{\pm}$ to $d_{xy}$-wave superconductivity
Authors: Lauro B. Braz, George B. Martins, Luis G. G. V. Dias da Silva
Abstract: We investigate the role of \emph{interlayer} interaction terms in the competition between different superconducting gap symmetries in the bilayer nickelate $\text{La}_3\text{Ni}_2\text{O}_7$ under high pressure. We study a two-layer, two-orbital electron model that encompasses both intra- and interlayer Coulomb interaction terms within the matrix random-phase approximation. We find that interlayer interactions favor a $d_{xy}$-wave superconducting pairing symmetry over the $s^{\pm}$-wave symmetry, which has been found to prevail when interlayer interactions are disregarded. Moreover, our findings indicate that interlayer interactions enhance the interorbital pairing, incorporating contributions from all three electron pockets, arising from both $d_{3z^2-r^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbital character, resulting in nodes within the gap function (not present in the $s^{\pm}$-wave state) and consequently favoring the $d_{xy}$-wave pairing.

Title: Phases and critical transport of the SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model on the triangular lattice
Authors: Lu Zhang, Rongning Liu, Xue-Yang Song
Abstract: We study phases and transitions of a triangular Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field, called the Hofstadter-Hubbard model. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 4, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from self-consistent mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid (or stripe) states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U. We study the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid. The critical behavior serves as strong signatures of the critical theory and consequently of the existence of chiral spin liquid as the proximate phase.

Title: Insights into Formation of Bicontinuous Emulsion Gels via in-situ (Ultra-)Small Angle X-ray Scattering
Authors: Meyer T. Alting, Dominique M.E. Thies-Weesie, Alexander M. van Silfhout, Mariska de Ruiter, Theyencheri Narayanan, Martin F. Haase, Andrei V. Petukhov
Abstract: Nanostructured materials formed via kinetically controlled self-assembly processes gather more interest nowadays. Bicontinuous emulsion gels stabilized by colloidal particles, called bijels, are attractive materials in soft-matter as they combine bulk properties of two immiscible liquids into an interwoven network structure. The limited understanding of the complex formation phenomena of bijels restricts the control over the synthesis, and so its applicability. In this work, in-situ (ultra-) small-angle X-ray scattering is applied to gain insight into the phase separation and self-assembly kinetics of bijels formed via solvent transfer induced phase separation. An X-ray compatible microfluidic setup allows accessing the process kinetics with a millisecond resolution. The formation of such bijels is shown to occur via three consecutive steps related to fluid mechanics, nanoparticle self-assembly and liquid-liquid phase separation. This time-resolved monitor technique offers valuable insights into the structural evolution of kinetically controlled materials and enhances our understanding of the formation of bicontinuous emulsion gels.

Title: Novel Strontium Carbides Under Compression
Authors: Nikita Rybin, Evgeny Moerman, Pranab Gain, Artem R. Oganov, Alexander Shapeev
Abstract: Exploring the chemistry of materials at high pressures has lead to the discovery of previously unknown exotic compounds. Here, we systematically search for all thermodynamically stable Sr-C compounds under pressure (up to 100 GPa) using the ab initio evolutionary crystal structure prediction method. Our search lead to the discovery of hitherto unknown phases of SrC3, Sr2C5, Sr2C3, Sr2C, Sr3C2, and SrC. The newly discovered crystal structures feature a variety of different carbon environments ranging from isolated C anions and C-dimers to exotic polyatomic carbon anions including chains, stripes, and infinite ribbons consisting of pentagonal C5 and hexagonal C6 rings. Dynamical stability of all predicted compounds is confirmed by phonons calculations. Bader analysis unravels very diverse chemistry in these compounds and bonding patterns in some of them can be described using Zintl-Klemm rule.

Title: Self-interacting processes via Doob conditioning
Authors: Francesco Coghi, Juan P. Garrahan
Abstract: We connect self-interacting processes, that is, stochastic processes where transitions depend on the time spent by a trajectory in each configuration, to Doob conditioning. In this way we demonstrate that Markov processes with constrained occupation measures are realised optimally by self-interacting dynamics. We use a tensor network framework to guide our derivations. We illustrate our general results with new perspectives on well-known examples of self-interacting processes, such as random walk bridges, excursions, and forced excursions.

Title: Emergent active turbulence and intermittency in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii
Authors: Prince Vibek Baruah, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Biswajit Maji, Rahul Pandit, Prerna Sharma
Abstract: Active-fluid turbulence has been found in bacterial suspensions, but not so far in their algal counterparts. We present the first experimental evidence for turbulence in dense algal suspensions of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii. We carry out a detailed analysis of the statistical properties of the flow present in these cell suspensions and show that they are quantitatively distinct from their counterparts in two-dimensional fluid and bacterial turbulence. Both kinetic-energy and density spectra of the fluid flow in algal turbulence show power-law regimes with unique scaling exponents. The fluid velocity probability distribution function (PDF) is strongly non-Gaussian and the length dependence of the PDF of fluid-velocity increments indicates small-scale intermittency. We compare and contrast our results with recent theoretical predictions for active-scalar turbulence and active glasses. Overall, our results highlight that active turbulence can arise, even in absence of orientational instabilities, so it is not limited to bacterial suspensions but it can also be found in many biological systems with free-swimming micro-organisms.

Title: Tensor Learning and Compression of N-phonon Interactions
Authors: Yao Luo, Dhruv Mangtani, Shiyu Peng, Jia Yao, Sergei Kliavinek, Marco Bernardi
Abstract: Phonon interactions from lattice anharmonicity govern thermal properties and heat transport in materials. These interactions are described by n-th order interatomic force constants (n-IFCs), which can be viewed as high-dimensional tensors correlating the motion of n atoms, or equivalently encoding n-phonon scattering processes in momentum space. Here, we introduce a tensor decomposition to efficiently compress n-IFCs for arbitrary order n. Using tensor learning, we find optimal low-rank approximations of n-IFCs by solving the resulting optimization problem. Our approach reveals the inherent low dimensionality of phonon-phonon interactions and allows compression of the 3 and 4-IFC tensors by factors of up to $10^3-10^4$ while retaining high accuracy in calculations of phonon scattering rates and thermal conductivity. Calculations of thermal conductivity using the compressed n-IFCs achieve a speed-up by nearly three orders of magnitude with >98% accuracy relative to the reference uncompressed solution. These calculations include both 3- and 4-phonon scattering and are shown for a diverse range of materials (Si, HgTe, MgO, and TiNiSn). In addition to accelerating state-of-the-art thermal transport calculations, the method shown here paves the way for modeling strongly anharmonic materials and higher-order phonon interactions.

Title: Two and three-state quantum heat engines with stochastic resetting
Authors: Ashutosh Kumar, Sourabh Lahiri, Trilochan Bagarti, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: Quantum heat engines have undergone extensive studies over the last two decades. Simultaneously, the studies of the applications of stochastic resetting in various fields are on the rise. We explore the effect of stochastic resetting on the dynamics of a two-level and a three-level quantum heat engine. The extracted work is shown to increase with the resetting rate. However, the effective efficiency that includes the work expended in resetting is shown to exhibit a steady decay with the increase in resetting rate. The efficient power is observed to increase beyond that obtained in the absence of resetting, and is shown to be higher for a three-level engine.

Title: Loewner Evolution for Critical Invasion Percolation Tree
Authors: Leidy M. L. Abril, André A. Moreira, José S. Andrade Jr., Hans J. Herrmann
Abstract: Extending the Schramm--Loewner Evolution (SLE) to model branching structures while preserving conformal invariance and other stochastic properties remains a formidable research challenge. Unlike simple paths, branching structures, or trees, must be associated with discontinuous driving functions. Moreover, the driving function of a particular tree is not unique and depends on the order in which the branches are explored during the SLE process. This study investigates trees formed by nontrapping invasion percolation (NTIP) within the SLE framework. Three strategies for exploring a tree are employed: the invasion percolation process itself, Depth--First Search (DFS), and Breadth--First Search (BFS). We analyze the distributions of displacements of the Loewner driving functions and compute their spectral densities. Additionally, we investigate the inverse problem of deriving new traces from the driving functions, achieving a reasonably accurate reconstruction of the tree-like structures using the BFS and NTIP methods. Our results suggest the lack of conformal invariance in the exploration paths of the trees, as evidenced by the non-Brownian nature of the driving functions for the BFS and NTIP methods, and the inconsistency of the diffusion constants for the DFS method.

Title: High-throughput computation and machine learning modeling of magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters for Fe-based intermetallics
Authors: Bo Zhao, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Based on high-throughput density functional theory calculations, we evaluate the local magnetic moments and Mössbauer properties for Fe-based intermetallic compounds and employ machine learning to map the local crystalline environments to such properties. It is observed that magnetic moments and Mössbauer parameters provide complementary insights into the local crystalline environment, where the statistical features cannot be captured using phenomenological models. Furthermore, we find that the scarcity of existing data in Materials Project (MP) poses a significant challenge in developing predictive machine learning models, whereas SOAP-based descriptors can be applied for reliable modeling of the enriched datasets with extra structural prototypes. This work advances the mapping of local crystalline structures to magnetic and spectroscopic properties, bridging the gap between empirical observations and theoretical models.

Title: A hybrid method integrating Green's function Monte Carlo and projected entangled pair states
Authors: He-Yu Lin, Rong-Qiang He, Yibin Guo, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: This paper introduces a hybrid approach combining Green's function Monte Carlo (GFMC) method with projected entangled pair state (PEPS) ansatz. This hybrid method regards PEPS as a trial state and a guiding wave function in GFMC. By leveraging PEPS's proficiency in capturing quantum state entanglement and GFMC's efficient parallel architecture, the hybrid method is well-suited for the accurate and efficient treatment of frustrated quantum spin systems. As a benchmark, we applied this approach to study the frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on a square lattice with periodic boundary conditions (PBC). Compared with other numerical methods, our approach integrating PEPS and GFMC shows competitive accuracy in the performance of ground-state energy. This paper provides systematic and comprehensive discussion of the approach of our previous work.

Title: Epithelial layer fluidization by curvature-induced unjamming
Authors: Margherita De Marzio, Amit Das, Jeffrey J. Fredberg, Dapeng Bi
Abstract: The transition of an epithelial layer from a stationary, quiescent state to a highly migratory, dynamic state is required for wound healing, development, and regeneration. This transition, known as the unjamming transition (UJT), is responsible for epithelial fluidization and collective migration. Previous theoretical models have primarily focused on the UJT in flat epithelial layers, neglecting the effects of strong surface curvature characteristic of the epithelium \textit{in vivo}. In this study, we investigate the role of surface curvature on tissue plasticity and cellular migration using a vertex model embedded on a spherical surface. Our findings reveal that increasing curvature promotes the UJT by reducing the energy barriers to cellular rearrangements. Higher curvature favors cell intercalation, mobility, and self-diffusivity, resulting in epithelial structures that are malleable and migratory when small, but become more rigid and stationary as they grow. Together, these results provide a conceptual framework to better understand how cell shape, cell propulsion, and tissue geometry contribute to tissue malleability, remodeling, and stabilization.

Title: Near-future projections in continuous agent-based models for crowd dynamics: mathematical structures in use and their implications
Authors: Iñaki Echeverría-Huarte (ULISBOA), Antonin Roge (ILM, ENS Paris Saclay), Olivier Simonin (CITI, INSA Lyon), Alexandre Nicolas (ILM, CNRS)
Abstract: This paper addresses the theoretical foundations of pedestrian models for crowd dynamics. While the topic gains momentum, current models differ widely in their mathematical structure, even if we only consider continuous agent-based models. To clarify their underpinning, we first lay the mathematical foundations of the common hierarchical decomposition into strategic, tactical, and operational levels and underline the practical interest in preserving the continuity between the latter two levels by working with a floor field, rather than way-points. Turning to local navigation, we clarify how three archetypical approaches, namely, purely reactive models, anticipatory models based on the idea of times to collision, and game theory, differ in the way they extrapolate trajectories in the near future. We also insist on the oft-overlooked distinction between processes pertaining to decision-making and physical contact forces. The implications of these differences are illustrated with a comparison of the numerical predictions of these models in the simple scenario of head-on collision avoidance between agents, by varying the walking speed, the reaction times, and the degree of courtesy of the agents, notably.

Title: Multimodal Foundation Models for Material Property Prediction and Discovery
Authors: Viggo Moro, Charlotte Loh, Rumen Dangovski, Ali Ghorashi, Andrew Ma, Zhuo Chen, Samuel Kim, Peter Y. Lu, Thomas Christensen, Marin Soljačić
Abstract: Artificial intelligence is transforming computational materials science, improving the prediction of material properties, and accelerating the discovery of novel materials. Recently, publicly available material data repositories have grown rapidly. This growth encompasses not only more materials but also a greater variety and quantity of their associated properties. Existing machine learning efforts in materials science focus primarily on single-modality tasks, i.e. relationships between materials and a single physical property, thus not taking advantage of the rich and multimodal set of material properties. Here, we introduce Multimodal Learning for Materials (MultiMat), which enables self-supervised multi-modality training of foundation models for materials. We demonstrate our framework's potential using data from the Materials Project database on multiple axes: (i) MultiMat achieves state-of-the-art performance for challenging material property prediction tasks; (ii) MultiMat enables novel and accurate material discovery via latent space similarity, enabling screening for stable materials with desired properties; and (iii) MultiMat encodes interpretable emergent features that may provide novel scientific insights.

Abstract: We propose a platform for implementing a universal, globally driven quantum computer based on a 2D ladder hosting three different species of superconducting qubits. In stark contrast with the existing literature, our scheme exploits the always-on longitudinal ZZ coupling. The latter, combined with specific driving frequencies, enables the reach of a blockade regime, which plays a pivotal role in the computing scheme.

Title: Evaluating the Performance and Robustness of LLMs in Materials Science Q&A and Property Predictions
Authors: Hongchen Wang, Kangming Li, Scott Ramsay, Yao Fehlis, Edward Kim, Jason Hattrick-Simpers
Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) have the potential to revolutionize scientific research, yet their robustness and reliability in domain-specific applications remain insufficiently explored. In this study, we evaluate the performance and robustness of LLMs for materials science, focusing on domain-specific question answering and materials property prediction across diverse real-world and adversarial conditions. Three distinct datasets are used in this study: 1) a set of multiple-choice questions from undergraduate-level materials science courses, 2) a dataset including various steel compositions and yield strengths, and 3) a band gap dataset, containing textual descriptions of material crystal structures and band gap values. The performance of LLMs is assessed using various prompting strategies, including zero-shot chain-of-thought, expert prompting, and few-shot in-context learning. The robustness of these models is tested against various forms of 'noise', ranging from realistic disturbances to intentionally adversarial manipulations, to evaluate their resilience and reliability under real-world conditions. Additionally, the study showcases unique phenomena of LLMs during predictive tasks, such as mode collapse behavior when the proximity of prompt examples is altered and performance recovery from train/test mismatch. The findings aim to provide informed skepticism for the broad use of LLMs in materials science and to inspire advancements that enhance their robustness and reliability for practical applications.

Title: Quantifying wave propagation in a chain of FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons
Authors: L. Messee Goulefack, C. Masoller, R. Yamapi, C. Anteneodo
Abstract: Understanding how external stimuli propagate in neural systems is an important challenge in the fields of neuroscience and nonlinear dynamics. Despite extensive studies over several decades, this problem remains poorly understood. In this work, we examine a simple ``toy model'' of an excitable medium, a linear chain of diffusely coupled FitzHugh-Nagumo neurons, and analyze the transmission of a sinusoidal signal injected into one of the neurons at the ends of the chain. We measure to what extent the propagation of the wave reaching the opposite end is affected by the frequency and amplitude of the signal, the number of neurons in the chain and the strength of their mutual diffusive coupling. To quantify these effects, we measure the cross-correlation between the time-series of the membrane potentials of the end neurons. This measure allows us to detect the values of the parameters that delimit different propagation regimes.

Title: Vortex Avalanches and Collective Motion in Neutron Stars
Authors: I-Kang Liu, Andrew W. Baggaley, Carlo F. Barenghi, Toby S. Wood
Abstract: We simulate the dynamics of about 600 quantum vortices in a spinning-down cylindrical container using a Gross--Pitaevskii model. For the first time, we find convincing spatial-temporal evidence of avalanching behaviour resulting from vortex depinning and collective motion. During a typical avalanche, about 10 to 20 vortices exit the container in a short period, producing a glitch in the superfluid angular momentum and a localised void in the vorticity. After the glitch, vortices continue to depin and circulate around the vorticity void in a similar manner to that seen in previous point-vortex simulations. We present evidence of collective vortex motion throughout this avalanche process. We also show that the effective Magnus force can be used to predict when and where avalanches will occur. Lastly, we comment on the challenge of extrapolating these results to conditions in real neutron stars, which contain many orders of magnitude more vortices.

Title: Model validation and error attribution for a drifting qubit
Authors: Malick A. Gaye, Dylan Albrecht, Steve Young, Tameem Albash, N. Tobias Jacobson
Abstract: Qubit performance is often reported in terms of a variety of single-value metrics, each providing a facet of the underlying noise mechanism limiting performance. However, the value of these metrics may drift over long time-scales, and reporting a single number for qubit performance fails to account for the low-frequency noise processes that give rise to this drift. In this work, we demonstrate how we can use the distribution of these values to validate or invalidate candidate noise models. We focus on the case of randomized benchmarking (RB), where typically a single error rate is reported but this error rate can drift over time when multiple passes of RB are performed. We show that using a statistical test as simple as the Kolmogorov-Smirnov statistic on the distribution of RB error rates can be used to rule out noise models, assuming the experiment is performed over a long enough time interval to capture relevant low frequency noise. With confidence in a noise model, we show how care must be exercised when performing error attribution using the distribution of drifting RB error rate.

Title: Quantum criticality and universality in stationary state of long-range Kitaev model
Authors: Akash Mitra, Sanku Paul, Shashi C. L. Srivastava
Abstract: We investigate the signature of quantum criticality in the long-time stationary state of the long-range Kitaev chain by performing various quench protocols. In this model, the pairing interaction decays with distance according to a power law with exponent $\alpha$. Using quantum information-theoretic measures, such as mutual information and logarithmic negativity, we show that, irrespective of the values of $\alpha$, critical-to-critical quench displays quantum criticality even in the stationary state. Remarkably, in the presence of long-range pairing interactions, where fermionic correlators decay algebraically even at non-critical points, signature of quantum criticality persists in the stationary state. Furthermore, the effective central charge, calculated from both mutual information and logarithmic negativity of stationary state following a critical-to-critical quench, agrees with the central charge of the corresponding ground states for both $\alpha = 0$ and $\alpha = 2$. Therefore, information of the universality class can be inferred from the stationary state.

Title: Selection rules for RG flows of minimal models
Authors: Valentin Benedetti, Horacio Casini, Javier M. Magan
Abstract: Minimal d=2 CFTs are usually classified through modular invariant partition functions. There is a finer classification of ``non complete'' models when S-duality is not imposed. We approach this classification by starting with the local chiral algebra and adding primaries sequentially. At each step, we only impose locality (T-duality) and closure of the operator algebra. For each chiral algebra, this produces a tree-like graph. Each tree node corresponds to a local d=2 CFT, with an intrinsic Jones index measuring the size of Haag duality violation. This index can be computed with the partition function and is related to the total quantum dimension of the category of superselection sectors of the node, and to the relative size between the node and a modular invariant completion. In this way, we find in a very explicit manner a classification of local minimal (c<1) d=2 CFTs. When appropriate, this matches Kawahigashi-Longo's previous results. We use this finer classification to constrain RG flows. For a relevant perturbation, the flow can be restricted to the subalgebra associated with it, typically corresponding to a non-modular invariant node in the tree. The structure of the graph above such node needs to be preserved by the RG flow. In particular, the superselection sector category for the node must be preserved. This gives selection rules that recover in a unified fashion several known facts while unraveling new ones.

Title: Tensor Completion for Surrogate Modeling of Material Property Prediction
Authors: Shaan Pakala, Dawon Ahn, Evangelos Papalexakis
Abstract: When designing materials to optimize certain properties, there are often many possible configurations of designs that need to be explored. For example, the materials' composition of elements will affect properties such as strength or conductivity, which are necessary to know when developing new materials. Exploring all combinations of elements to find optimal materials becomes very time consuming, especially when there are more design variables. For this reason, there is growing interest in using machine learning (ML) to predict a material's properties. In this work, we model the optimization of certain material properties as a tensor completion problem, to leverage the structure of our datasets and navigate the vast number of combinations of material configurations. Across a variety of material property prediction tasks, our experiments show tensor completion methods achieving 10-20% decreased error compared with baseline ML models such as GradientBoosting and Multilayer Perceptron (MLP), while maintaining similar training speed.

Title: Local ergotropy dynamically witnesses many-body localized phases
Authors: Francesco Formicola, Grazia Di Bello, Giulio De Filippis, Vittorio Cataudella, Donato Farina, Carmine Antonio Perroni
Abstract: Many-body localization is a dynamical phenomenon characteristic of strongly interacting and disordered many-body quantum systems which fail to achieve thermal equilibrium. From a quantum information perspective, the fingerprint of this phenomenon is the logarithmic growth of the entanglement entropy over time. We perform intensive numerical simulations, applied to a paradigmatic model system, showing that the local ergotropy, the maximum extractable work via local unitary operations on a small subsystem in the presence of Hamiltonian coupling, dynamically witnesses the change from ergodic to localized phases. Within the many-body localized phase, both the local ergotropy and its quantum fluctuations slowly vary over time with a characteristic logarithmic law analogous to the behaviour of entanglement entropy. This showcases how directly leveraging local control, instead of local observables or entropies analyzed in previous works, provides a thermodynamic marker of localization phenomena based on the locally extractable work.

Title: Emergent turbulence and coarsening arrest in active-spinner fluids
Authors: Biswajit Maji, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: We uncover activity-driven crossover from phase separation to a new turbulent state in a two-dimensional system of counter-rotating spinners. We study the statistical properties of this active-rotor turbulence using the active-rotor Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes model, and show that the vorticity $\omega \propto \phi$, the scalar field that distinguishes regions with different rotating states. We explain this intriguing proportionality theoretically, and we characterize power-law energy and concentration spectra, intermittency, and flow-topology statistics. We suggest biological implications of such turbulence.

Title: Fermionic Partial Transpose in the Overlap Matrix Framework for Entanglement Negativity
Authors: Jun Qi Fang, Xiao Yan Xu
Abstract: Over the past two decades, the overlap matrix approach has been developed to compute quantum entanglement in free-fermion systems, particularly to calculate entanglement entropy and entanglement negativity. This method involves the use of partial trace and partial transpose operations within the overlap matrix framework. However, previous studies have only considered the conventional partial transpose in fermionic systems, which does not account for fermionic anticommutation relations. Although the concept of a fermionic partial transpose was introduced in \cite{Shapourian2017prb}, it has not yet been systematically incorporated into the overlap matrix framework. In this paper, we introduce the fermionic partial transpose into the overlap matrix approach, provide a systematic analysis of the validity of partial trace and partial transpose operations, and derive an explicit formula for calculating entanglement negativity in bipartite systems. Additionally, we numerically compute the logarithmic negativity of two lattice models to verify the Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law. For tripartite geometries, we uncover limitations of the overlap matrix method and demonstrate that the previously reported logarithmic negativity result for a homogeneous one-dimensional chain in a disjoint interval geometry exceeds its theoretical upper bound. Our findings contribute to a deeper understanding of partial trace and partial transpose operations in different representations.
