Title: Nonreciprocal spin waves in out-of-plane magnetized waveguides reconfigured by domain wall displacements
Authors: H. Mortada, R. Verba, Q. Wang, P. Pirro, A. Hamadeh
Abstract: Wave-based platforms for novel unconventional computing approaches like neuromorphic computing require a well-defined, but adjustable flow of wave information combined with non-volatile data storage elements to implement weights which allow for training and learning. Due to their inherent nonreciprocal properties and their direct physical interaction with magnetic data storage, spin waves are ideal candidates to realize such platforms. In the present study, we show how spin-wave nonreciprocity induced by dipolar interactions of nanowaveguides with antiparallel, out-of-plane magnetization orientations can be used to create a spin-wave circulator allowing for unidirectional information transport and complex signal routing. In addition, the device can be reconfigured by a magnetic domain wall with adjustable position, which allows for a non-volatile tuning of the nonreciprocity and signal propagation. These properties are demonstrated for a spin-wave directional coupler through a combination of micromagnetic simulations and analytical modeling also showing that it functions as a waveguide crossing element, tunable power splitter, isolator, and frequency multiplexer. As magnetic material, out-of-plane magnetized Bismuth-doped Yttrium Iron Garnet has been considered. For this material, the motion of domain walls by magnonic spin transfer torque has been recently experimentally demonstrated which enables to store results from spin-wave computation. In combination with the presented concept of domain wall based reconfiguration and nonlinear spin-wave dynamics, this enables for the creation of a nano-scaled nonlinear wave computing platform with the capability for self-learning.

Title: Spatially patterned phases in a reaction-time-symmetry-broken model of flocking
Authors: Charles R. Packard, Daniel M. Sussman
Abstract: We introduce a Vicsek-like flocking model with a minimal form of time-delayed orientational interactions, in which the delays occur on a time scale that is well-separated from other time scales in the model. We achieve this by implementing an ``index-ordered'' update rule, mimicking a scenario in which agents have a distribution of times with which they react to information. This model retains the usual disorder-to-order transition common in flocking models, but we show that it also possesses a second transition, deep in the polar flocking phase, to a state with spatially patterned transverse velocities. We characterize this transition and its sensitivity to finite-size effects using the Binder cumulant, and demonstrate -- via direct measurements and by measuring a susceptibility of the phase to particle index permutations -- that the stability of this phase is directly tied to a subtle spatial organization of a slow-relaxing index-order field. These results highlight the potential for even seemingly insignificant temporal asymmetries to fundamentally alter the collective behavior of active matter.

Title: Achieving accurate entropy and melting point by ab initio molecular dynamics and zentropy theory: Application to fluoride and chloride molten salts
Authors: Shun-Li Shang, Nigel L. E. Hew, Rushi Gong, Cillian Cockrell, Paul A. Bingham, Xiaofeng Guo, Qijun Hong, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: We have recently developed a breakthrough methodology for rapidly computing entropy in both solids and liquids by integrating a multiscale entropy approach (known as zentropy theory) with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. This approach enables entropy estimation from a single MD trajectory by analyzing the probabilities of local structural configurations and atomic distributions, effectively addressing the long-standing challenge of capturing configurational entropy. Here, we demonstrate the power of this method by predicting entropies, enthalpies, and melting points for 25 binary and ternary chlorite- and fluoride-based molten salts using ab initio MD (AIMD) simulations. The strong agreement between our predictions and experimental data underscores the potential of this approach to transform computational thermodynamics, offering accurate, efficient, and direct predictions of thermodynamic properties across both solid and liquid phases.

Title: An infinite grid of mesoscopic resistors: investigation and visualization of ballistic conduction
Authors: Oliwier Urbański
Abstract: A square lattice of mesoscopic resistors is considered. Each bond is modeled as a narrow waveguide, while junctions are sources of elastic scattering given by a scattering matrix \mathbf{S}. Symmetry and unitarity constraints are used in a detailed way to simplify all possible matrices \mathbf{S}. Energetic band structure of the system is determined and visualized for exemplary parameters. Conductance between external electrodes attached to two arbitrary nodes is given by the Landauer formula. Thus the transmittance between the electrodes is calculated. The rest of the paper is devoted to studying wave function patterns arising from an electron injected through one electrode into the system. It is observed that depending on its energy both dull and localized or intricate and expansive patterns occur. It is justified mathematically that fitting electron energy into an energy band can be associated with emergence of complex patterns. Finally, possible experimental realizations of the considered model are briefly mentioned.

Title: Microscopic description of the liquid-gas coexistence curve for Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point
Authors: I.V. Pylyuk, M.P. Kozlovskii, R.V. Romanik
Abstract: The present work is aimed at investigating the behavior of Morse fluids in the immediate vicinity of the critical point within the framework of a cell model. This region is of both fundamental and practical importance, yet presents analytical challenges due to the significant influence of order parameter fluctuations. An analytical procedure is developed to construct the upper part of the liquid-gas coexistence curve and calculate its diameter, incorporating the non-Gaussian (quartic) distribution of fluctuations. An explicit expression is derived for the temperature-dependent analytical term appearing in the expression for the rectilinear diameter. The numerical evaluation of the relevant quantities is carried out using Morse potential parameters representative of sodium. The coexistence curve is constructed both with and without the inclusion of the analytical temperature-dependent term in the calculation. A specific condition is identified under which the agreement between the presented binodal branches and Monte Carlo simulation data from other study, extrapolated to the immediate vicinity of the critical point, is improved. It is shown that better agreement is achieved when the analytical term is included in the calculation of the liquid branch and omitted in the gas branch. The proposed analytical approach may provide useful insight for the theoretical study of critical phenomena in more complex fluid systems.

Title: New generation of cavity microscope for quantum simulations
Authors: Gaia Stella Bolognini, Zeyang Xue, Michael Alexander Eichenberger, Nick Sauerwein, Francesca Orsi, Ekaterina Fedotova, Rohit Prasad Bhatt, Jean-Philippe Brantut
Abstract: We present the design and assembly of a cavity microscope for quantum simulations with ultracold atoms. The system integrates a high-finesse optical cavity with a pair of high-numerical aperture lenses sharing a common optical axis, enabling simultaneous operation with light close-to-atomic resonance. The system keeps the advantages of a rigid, single-block structure holding the lenses and cavity together, and improves over existing designs by using most of the solid angle left free by the cavity mode for imaging and atomic manipulation purposes. The cavity has a length of $19.786$mm, a finesse of $2.35\times 10^4$ and operates $214\mu\text{m}$ away from the concentric limit, deep in the strong coupling regime. The two lenses offer a numerical aperture of $0.52$ each and maximal optical access in all directions transverse to the cavity axis, compatible with applications in quantum-gas microscopes, micro-tweezer arrays or few-fermions systems, as well as future cavity-assisted quantum simulation protocols demanding sub-cavity-mode control of the atom-cavity coupling.

Title: Exact multiple anomalous mobility edges in a flat band geometry
Authors: Zhanpeng Lu, Hui Liu, Yunbo Zhang, Zhihao Xu
Abstract: Anomalous mobility edges(AMEs), separating localized from {multifractal critical states}, represent a novel form of localization transition in quasiperiodic systems. However, quasi-periodic models exhibiting exact {AMEs} remain relatively rare, limiting the understanding of these transitions. In this work, we leverage the geometric structure of flat band models to construct exact {AMEs}. Specifically, we introduce an anti-symmetric diagonal quasi-periodic mosaic modulation, which consists of both quasi-periodic and constant potentials, into a cross-stitch flat band lattice. When the constant potential is zero, the system resides entirely in a localized phase, with its dispersion relation precisely determined. For non-zero constant potentials, we use a simple method to derive analytical solutions for a class of {AMEs}, providing exact results for both the {AMEs} and the system's localization and critical properties. Additionally, we propose a classical electrical circuit design to experimentally realize the system. This study offers valuable insights into the existence and characteristics of {AMEs} in quasi-periodic systems.

Title: Crescent domain-wall pairs in anisotropic two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with fast dynamics
Authors: Yijun Yang, Zhong Shen, Jun Chen, Shuai Dong, Xiaoyan Yao
Abstract: The controllable and efficient manipulation is always a key challenge for the application of topological magnetic textures in spintronic devices. By first-principles calculations and atomistic simulations, the present work reveals an exotic domain-wall pair in crescent shape, which possesses topology in one dimension and particle-like robustness in two dimensions. Its antiferromagnetic version is observed in the two-dimensional MnOI monolayer with a strong anisotropy, and the ferromagnetic version exists under an appropriate strain. Both of them can be driven efficiently by current to move in a straight line along a certain direction. Hereby, another possible path is provided to realize the application of topological magnetic texture in the next-generation high-speed spintronic devices.

Title: Sequential topology: iterative topological phase transitions in finite chiral structures
Authors: Maxine M. McCarthy, D. M. Whittaker
Abstract: We present theoretical and experimental results probing the rich topological structure of arbitrarily disordered finite tight binding Hamiltonians with chiral symmetry. We extend the known classification by considering the topological properties of phase boundaries themselves. That is, can Hamiltonians that are confined to being topologically marginal, also have distinct topological phases? For chiral structures, we answer this in the affirmative, where we define topological phase boundaries as having an unavoidable increase in the degeneracy of real space zero modes. By iterating this question, and considering how to enforce a Hamiltonian to a phase boundary, we give a protocol to find the largest dimension subspace of a disordered parameter space that has a certain order degeneracy of zero energy states, which we call \textit{sequential topology}. We show such degeneracy alters localisation and transport properties of zero modes, allowing us to experimentally corroborate our theory using a state-of-the-art coaxial cable platform. Our theory applies to systems with an arbitrary underlying connectivity or disorder, and so can be calculated for any finite chiral structure. Technological and theoretical applications of our work are discussed.

Title: Topological surface states in γ-PtBi$_2$ evidenced by scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Yunkai Guo, Jingming Yan, Wen-Han Dong, Yongkai Li, Yucong Peng, Xuetao Di, Caizhen Li, Zhiwei Wang, Yong Xu, Peizhe Tang, Yugui Yao, Wenhui Duan, Qi-Kun Xue, Wei Li
Abstract: For the application of topological materials, the specific location of their topological surface states with respect to the Fermi level are important. {\gamma}-PtBi2 has been demonstrated to be a Weyl semimetal possessing superconducting Fermi arcs by photoemission spectroscopy. However, the evidence of its topological surface states is lacking by scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), which should be rather sensitive to detect the surface states. Here, we show multiple STM evidences for the existence of topological surface states in {\gamma}-PtBi2. We observe not only the step-edge and screw dislocation induced quasiparticle interference fringes, originating from the electron scatterings between the Fermi arcs of {\gamma}-PtBi2, but also the back-scattering prohibition related to the spin-flip process, which is the direct evidence for the topological nature of the surface states. Moreover, we demonstrate that the topological surface states are precisely located over a narrow energy range near the Fermi level, within which sharply enhanced intensity and slow spatial decay of quasiparticle interference are observed.

Title: Observation of unexpected band splitting and magnetically-induced band structure reconstruction in TbTi$_3$Bi$_4$
Authors: Yevhen Kushnirenko, Lin-Lin Wang, Xiaoyi Su, Benjamin Schrunk, Evan O'Leary, Andrew Eaton, P. C. Canfield, Adam Kaminski
Abstract: The magnetic Kagome materials are a promising platform to study the interplay between magnetism, topology, and correlated electronic phenomena. Among these materials, the RTi3Bi4 family received a great deal of attention recently because of its chemical versatility and wide range of magnetic properties. Here, we use angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements and density functional theory calculations to investigate the electronic structure of TbTi3Bi4 in paramagnetic and antiferromagnetic phases. Our experimental results show the presence of unidirectional band splitting of unknown nature in both phases. In addition, we observed a complex reconstruction of the band structure in the antiferromagnetic phase. Some aspects of this reconstruction are consistent with effects of additional periodicity introduced by the magnetic ordering vector, while the nature of several other features remains unknown.

Title: MatTools: Benchmarking Large Language Models for Materials Science Tools
Authors: Siyu Liu, Jiamin Xu, Beilin Ye, Bo Hu, David J. Srolovitz, Tongqi Wen
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are increasingly applied to materials science questions, including literature comprehension, property prediction, materials discovery and alloy design. At the same time, a wide range of physics-based computational approaches have been developed in which materials properties can be calculated. Here, we propose a benchmark application to evaluate the proficiency of LLMs to answer materials science questions through the generation and safe execution of codes based on such physics-based computational materials science packages. MatTools is built on two complementary components: a materials simulation tool question-answer (QA) benchmark and a real-world tool-usage benchmark. We designed an automated methodology to efficiently collect real-world materials science tool-use examples. The QA benchmark, derived from the pymatgen (Python Materials Genomics) codebase and documentation, comprises 69,225 QA pairs that assess the ability of an LLM to understand materials science tools. The real-world benchmark contains 49 tasks (138 subtasks) requiring the generation of functional Python code for materials property calculations. Our evaluation of diverse LLMs yields three key insights: (1)Generalists outshine specialists;(2)AI knows AI; and (3)Simpler is better. MatTools provides a standardized framework for assessing and improving LLM capabilities for materials science tool applications, facilitating the development of more effective AI systems for materials science and general scientific research.

Title: Beyond surfaces: quantifying internal radiative heat transport in dense materials
Authors: Janak Tiwari, Tianli Feng
Abstract: While phonons and electrons are well-established heat carriers in solids, photons are typically associated only with radiative transfer between surfaces. Yet for over 70 years, theorists have speculated that thermal photons could also conduct heat within dense, opaque materials -- an idea that has remained unproven and unquantified. Here, we resolve this longstanding question by developing a first-principles framework that reveals and quantifies the internal radiative contribution to thermal conductivity in solids. By analyzing 15 crystalline materials, we uncover photon mean free paths (MFPs) ranging from $\sim$100$\mu$m to over 1cm, with some materials exhibiting surprisingly large radiative thermal conductivity ($\kappa_{\text{rad}}$). Contrary to common assumptions, we show that $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ can scale steeply with temperature (from $T^{1}$ to $T^{4}$), even as MFPs decrease (from $T^{-0.3}$ to $T^{-3}$). We also discover a robust link between photon MFP and phonon linewidths, revealing an unexpected interplay between radiative and phononic heat transport. Crucially, we establish a general formalism to calculate $\kappa_{\text{rad}}$ across arbitrary sample thicknesses and surface emissivities -- bridging ballistic and diffusive regimes. Our findings overturn long-held assumptions, uncover a missing channel of heat conduction, and provide a powerful new tool for thermal management in extreme environments.

Title: Surface coupling of NV centers over nanoscale lengths
Authors: Arsineh Apelian, Mariya Romanova, Vojtech Vlcek
Abstract: Shallow nitrogen-vacancy (NV-) centers in diamond are among the most promising quantum sensors, offering high sensitivity and nanoscale spatial resolution. These systems are, however, prone to decoherence due to coupling with surface states. Here, we study sub-surface NV- centers embedded into large diamond slabs (8 nm) using various surface orientations (100 and 111) and terminations (hydrogen and nitrogen terminators) and compute the quasiparticle states of the defect. Our results show how dynamical charge fluctuations near the surface influence defect stability. We find that the (100) N-terminated surface introduces strong surface-state instabilities, while the (111) N-terminated surface provides a more favorable configuration. However, many-body calculations (within the GW approximation) reveal that defects placed shallower than ~ 4 nm are prone to surface-induced ionization. These findings establish an accurate theoretical limit on the minimum depth required for stable NV- centers, guiding the design of NV- based quantum sensors.

Title: Exploring the Interplay Between Formation Mechanisms and Luminescence of Lignin Carbon Quantum Dots from Spruce Biomass
Authors: Jelena Papan Djaniš, Maja Szymczak, Jan Hočevar, Jernej Iskra, Boštjan Genorio, Darja Lisjak, Lukasz Marciniak, Karolina Elzbieciak-Piecka
Abstract: This study investigates the intricate relationship between the formation mechanisms and luminescent properties of lignin-derived carbon quantum dots (LG-CQDs) synthesized from spruce biomass by hydrothermal treatment. A comprehensive understanding of LG-CQD structure and its photoluminescence requires insights into the native architecture of lignin and the distribution of its acidolysis-derived fragments. Research showed how these lignin-derived units interact with dopant molecules in three different approaches during synthesis, contributing to core and surface structures that govern the optical behavior. Our findings reveal a clear correlation between structural features and luminescent properties, emphasizing the role of surface chemistry in tuning emission characteristics. These insights provide a foundation for the rational design of LG-CQDs with tailored luminescent properties, advancing their potential applications in sustainable optoelectronics, sensing, and bioimaging.

Title: Effects of Coupling Between Chiral Vibrations and Spins in Molecular Magnets
Authors: Aman Ullah, Sergey A. Varganov, Yafis Barlas
Abstract: In single molecular magnets, chiral vibrations carrying vibrational angular momentum ($\hat{L}^{\text{vib}}$) emerge due to the splitting of a doubly degenerate vibrational mode. Here, we identify a new type of effective spin-vibrational coupling responsible for lifting this degeneracy, which can facilitate optically selective excitations. In the presence of an external Zeeman field, this coupling breaks both inversion (in-plane parity) $\mathcal{P}$ and time-reversal $\mathcal{T}$ symmetries, imparting distinct geometric phases to the resulting dressed spin-vibronic states. The wave function of the spin-vibronic state is characterized by a $\pi$-Berry phase, which results in magneto-optical circular dichroism. This framework is validated using density functional theory and multi-reference \emph{ab initio} calculations on the Ce(trenovan) molecular magnet.

Title: Pressure induced evolution of anisotropic superconductivity and Fermi surface nesting in a ternary boride
Authors: Subhajit Pramanick, Sudip Chakraborty, A. Taraphder
Abstract: Using Migdal-Eliashberg theory implemented in Electron Phonon Wannier (EPW) code, we have investigated anisotropic superconductivity of a ternary boride $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$. The robust coupling between $\mathrm{\sigma}$-bonding states, primarily created by the d-orbitals of Mo atoms and the in-plane vibrations of Mo atoms, facilitates the generation of cooper pairs that make $\mathrm{Ta(MoB)_2}$ a single-gap anisotropic superconductor with a critical temperature ($\mathrm{T_c}\sim ) \, 19.3$ K. A weak Fermi surface nesting and the low value of electron-phonon coupling cannot induce charge density wave instabilities, as evidenced by the lack of a significant peak in the real part of total Lindhard susceptibility and the absence of phonon softening. Furthermore, the system is readily tunable by hydrostatic pressure up to 76.69 GPa, owing to its low bulk modulus and negative formation energy. The persistent reduction in the density of states at the Fermi level, Fermi nesting and the stiffening of phonon modes leads to a diminution of superconductivity under pressure up to 59.71 GPa. At 76.69 GPa, a modification in the topology of the Fermi surface, namely a Lifshitz transition, occurs resulting in a sudden improvement in the nesting condition. This enhanced nesting, in turn, induces an abrupt stabilisation of superconductivity at 76.69 GPa, resulting in a V-shaped response to pressure.

Title: A Non-Markovian Route to Coherence in Heterogeneous Diffusive Systems
Authors: Aranyak Sarkar
Abstract: Temporal coherence-persistent alignment across time-can arise between agents with fundamentally distinct dynamics, a behavior that classical diffusion models (e.g., Brownian motion, fractional Brownian motion, generalized Langevin equation) are inherently limited in capturing, particularly under strong heterogeneity. We introduce the Coupled Memory Graph Process (CMGP), where dynamic interplay between internal memory and directed coupling enables synchronized behavior even in the absence of reciprocity. An active particle with long-range memory remains temporally coherent with a subdiffusive partner, despite mismatched scaling laws and asymmetric information flow. Bayesian optimization identifies a broad parameter regime supporting this phenomenon, characterized by a high State Persistence Index SPI. These results uncover a minimal mechanism for emergent coordination-a form of ghost coherence-that remains inaccessible to classical stochastic models, with implications for viscoelastic environments and heterogeneous active systems.

Title: Effect of crystallinity on spin-orbit torque in 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$
Authors: Tetsuro Morimoto, Kohei Ueda, Junichi Shiogai, Takanori Kida, Masayuki Hagiwara, Jobu Matsuno
Abstract: The 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides provide an intriguing platform for generating an efficient spin current due to a unique electronic structure dominated by 5d electrons with strong spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report on the effect of crystallinity on current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT) in binary 5$\textit{d}$ iridium oxide IrO$_{2}$ thin films by controlling amorphous, polycrystalline, and epitaxial states. By conducting harmonic Hall measurement in bilayers composed of ferromagnetic Co$_{20}$Fe$_{60}$B$_{20}$ and IrO$_{2}$, we find that dampinglike (DL) SOT is larger than fieldlike SOT for all the samples. We also demonstrate that both electrical resistivity and the DL SOT efficiency increase in order of epitaxial, polycrystalline, and amorphous IrO$_{2}$. Despite their different electrical conductivities, spin Hall conductivities of the three states of the IrO$_{2}$ layer are found to be nearly constant, which is consistent with the intrinsic regime of the spin Hall effect scaling relation. Our results highlight the important role that crystallinity plays in the spin-current generation, leading to the potential technological development of spintronic devices based on the 5$\textit{d}$ transition-metal oxides.

Title: Universal scaling of segment fluctuations in polymer and chromatin dynamics
Authors: Kirill Polovnikov, Mehran Kardar
Abstract: We demonstrate how center-of-mass (COM) motion influences polymer segment fluctuations. Cancellation of internal forces, together with spatially uncorrelated external noise, generally yields COM diffusivity scaling as $1/s$ with segment length $s$, regardless of fractal dimension, viscoelasticity, or activity. This introduces distinct dynamic scaling corrections to two-point fluctuations and quenched-induced tangential correlations, validated by theory, simulations, and chromatin imaging data. In the latter, the extracted dynamic exponent reveals topological constraints, thereby resolving the discrepancy between chromatin's crumpled structure and its Rouse-like dynamics.

Title: An approach for thermal conductivity measurements in thin films: Combining localized surface topography, thermal analysis, and machine learning techniques
Authors: Mohsen Dehbashi, Anna Kazmierczak-Balata, Jerzy Bodzenta
Abstract: This study presents a comprehensive methodology for determining the thermal conductivity (TC) of materials with high reliability. The methodology addresses issues such as surface topographical variations and substrate interference by combining Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM) with machine learning (ML) models and normalization techniques. Micro- and nanostructural variations in thin films exacerbate measurement inconsistencies, reducing repeatability and reliability. These interconnected challenges highlight the need for a novel, flexible, and adaptive methodology that can comprehensively address the complexities of thin film characterization while maintaining accuracy and efficiency. In this approach, sample surface was divided into fine spatial grids for localized thermal and topographical measurements. A substrate-thickness factor (C factor) was introduced to account for thickness and substrate effects on thin film TC, and high-performance Random Forest regression was used to predict TC across a broad range of materials. The models were trained on a dataset of 2,352 measurements that covered a wide range of material properties and then validated with an additional 980 measurements. They achieved high predictive accuracy, with a $R^2$ of 0.97886 during training and 0.96630 during testing. This approach addresses instrumental limitations and integrates experimental techniques with computational modeling, providing a scalable framework for a wide range of material science applications.

Title: Novel high symmetry super-hard C48 and C32 allotropes with ana and ukc original topologies: Crystal chemistry and DFT investigations
Authors: Samir F Matar
Abstract: Novel high symmetry body centered carbon allotropes: cubic C48 and tetragonal C32 are proposed with respective original ana and ukc topologies. Devised from crystal structure engineering, their ground state structures and energy derived physical properties were accurately derived based on quantum mechanics calculations within the density functional theory DFT. Both allotropes made of distorted tetrahedral C4 arrangements were found dense with rho larger than this http URL-3 that remain lower than diamond (rho = 3.50 this http URL-3). With cohesive albeit with metastable ground state structures, both allotropes show stability from the mechanical (elastic properties) and dynamic (phonons band structures) properties. Vickers hardness magnitudes HV(C48) =47 GPa and HV(C32) = 59 GPa point to super-hard materials. The electronic band structures range from large direct band gap close to 5 eV for C48 to indirect band gap close to 2.5 eV semi-conducting C32. Such findings of original allotropes with targeted physical properties are bound to enrich the field of research on carbon.

Title: Exploration of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as cathode for magnesium batteries
Authors: Vijay Choyal, Debsundar Dey, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam
Abstract: Development of energy storage technologies that can exhibit higher energy densities, better safety, and lower supply-chain constraints than the current state-of-the-art Li-ion batteries (LIBs) is crucial for our transition into sustainable energy use. In this context, Mg batteries (MBs) offer a promising pathway to design energy storage systems with superior volumetric energy densities than LIBs but require the development of positive electrodes (cathodes) exhibiting high energy and power densities. Notably, amorphous materials that lack long range order can exhibit `flatter' potential energy surfaces than crystalline frameworks, possibly resulting in faster Mg$^{2+}$ motion. Here, we use a combination of ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD), and machine learned interatomic potential (MLIP) based calculations to explore amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a potential cathode for MBs. Using an AIMD-generated dataset, we train and validate moment tensor potentials that can accurately model amorphous (Mg)V$_2$O$_5$ Due to the amorphization of V$_2$O$_5$, we observe a 10-14% drop in the average Mg intercalation voltage $-$ but the voltage remains higher than sulfide Mg cathodes. Importantly, we find a $\sim$seven (five) orders of magnitude higher Mg$^{2+}$ diffusivity in amorphous MgV$_2$O$_5$ than its crystalline version (thiospinel-Mg$_x$Ti$_2$S$_4$), which is directly attributable to the amorphization of the structure. Also, we note the Mg$^{2+}$ motion in the amorphous structure is significantly cross-correlated at low temperatures, with the correlation decreasing with increase in temperature. Thus, our work highlights the potential of amorphous V$_2$O$_5$ as a cathode that can exhibit both high energy and power densities, resulting in the practical deployment of MBs.

Title: Inelastic tunneling into multipolaronic bound states in single-layer MoS$_2$

Abstract: Polarons are quasiparticles that arise from the interaction of electrons or holes with lattice vibrations. Though polarons are well-studied across multiple disciplines, experimental observations of polarons in two-dimensional crystals are sparse. We use scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to measure inelastic excitations of polaronic bound states emerging from coupling of non-polar zone-boundary phonons to Bloch electrons in n-doped metallic single-layer MoS$_2$. The latter is kept chemically pristine via contactless chemical doping. Tunneling into the vibrationally coupled polaronic states leads to a series of evenly spaced peaks in the differential conductance on either side of the Fermi level. Combining density functional (perturbation) theory with a recently developed ab initio electron-lattice downfolding technique, we show that the energy spacing stems from the longitudinal-acoustic phonon mode that flattens at the Brillouin zone edge and is responsible for the formation of stable multipolarons in metallic MoS$_2$.

Title: Thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ maple-leaf Heisenberg antiferromagnet
Authors: Taras Hutak
Abstract: The Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the maple-leaf lattice has recently gathered a great deal of attention. Competition between three non-equivalent bond interactions results in various ground-state quantum phases, the exact dimer-product singlet ground state being among them. The thermodynamic properties of this model are much less understood. We used high-temperature expansion up to the $18$th order to study the thermodynamics of the $S=1/2$ Heisenberg model on the uniform maple-leaf lattice with the ground state exhibiting a six-sublattice $120^{\circ}$ long-range magnetic order. Padé approximants allow us to get reliable results up to the temperatures of about $T\approx 0.4$. To study thermodynamics for arbitrary temperatures, we made the interpolation using the entropy method. Based on the analysis of close Padé approximants, we find ground-state energy $e_{0}=-0.53064\ldots -0.53023$ in good agreement with numerical results. The specific heat $c(T)$ has a typical maximum at rather low temperatures $T\approx0.379$ and the uniform susceptibility $\chi(T)$ at $T\approx0.49$. We also estimate the value of $\chi(T)$ at zero temperature $\chi_{0}\approx0.05\ldots0.06$. The ground-state order manifests itself in the divergence of the so-called generalized Wilson ratio.

Title: Trapping in a Casimir Force Set-Up Controlled by Solution Permeability
Authors: S. Pal, L. Inacio, L. M. Woods, U. De Giovannini, C. Persson, M. Boström
Abstract: We have designed a system enabling tuning Casimir attraction/repulsion transitions between a polystyrene sphere attached to an atomic force microscope tip near a Teflon surface in a magnetic fluid mixture. Notably, the trapping distances can be changed by several orders of magnitude by changes in zero-frequency transverse electric contributions to the Casimir force. We demonstrate that this can be achieved via modifications in the average diameter for the magnetite particles while keeping the magnetite volume fractions fixed.

Title: Magnetotransport signatures of spin-orbit coupling in high-temperature cuprate superconductors
Authors: Aleix Barrera, Huidong Li, Thomas Gunkel, Jordi Alcalà, Silvia Damerio, Can Onur Avci, Anna Palau
Abstract: Spin transport in superconductors offers a compelling platform to merge the dissipationless nature of superconductivity with the functional promise of spin-based electronics. A significant challenge in achieving spin polarisation in conventional superconductors stems from the singlet state of Cooper pairs, which exhibit no net spin. The generation of spin-polarised carriers, quasiparticles, or triplet pairs in superconductors has predominantly been realised in hybrid superconductor/ferromagnet systems through proximity-induced spin polarisation. Historically, cuprate superconductors have been characterised by strong electronic correlations but negligible spin-orbit coupling. Here, we report exceptionally large anisotropic magnetoresistance and a pronounced planar Hall effect arising near the superconducting phase transition in the prototypical high-temperature cuprate superconductor YBa2Cu3O7-x without using a proximity ferromagnet. These effects, unprecedented in centrosymmetric cuprates, emerge from spin-polarised quasiparticle transport mediated by strong spin-orbit coupling. By systematically tuning magnetic field strength, orientation, temperature, and doping, we show clear evidence of spin-orbit-driven transport phenomena in a material class long thought to lack such interactions. Our findings reveal an unexpected spin-orbit landscape in cuprates and open a route to engineer spintronic functionalities in high-temperature superconductors.

Title: Time-resolved electron dynamics in antiferromagnetic CoO(001) thin films
Authors: Mathias Augstein, Friederike Wührl, Konrad Gillmeister, Cheng-Tien Chiang, Wolf Widdra
Abstract: Ultrathin antiferromagnetic CoO(001)-(1x1) films of 2 and 4 monolayers (ML) on Ag(001) are investigated by time- and angle-resolved two-photon photoelectron (2PPE) spectroscopy. Pump-probe spectra show unoccupied states between 3.6 and 4.0\,eV above the Fermi level ($E_{F}$), which are identified as image potential states with momentum-dependent lifetimes between 12 to 20\,fs. Electrons photoexcited across the band gap show lifetimes of 27\,fs at the bottom of the Co $3d$ $t_{2g}$-derived conduction band minimum. This lifetime is much shorter than in conventional semiconductors. Our observations point either to strong electron correlation effects as has been demonstrated for NiO or to an ultrafast relaxation pathway via metallic substrate states.

Title: Space Group Equivariant Crystal Diffusion
Authors: Rees Chang, Angela Pak, Alex Guerra, Ni Zhan, Nick Richardson, Elif Ertekin, Ryan P. Adams
Abstract: Accelerating inverse design of crystalline materials with generative models has significant implications for a range of technologies. Unlike other atomic systems, 3D crystals are invariant to discrete groups of isometries called the space groups. Crucially, these space group symmetries are known to heavily influence materials properties. We propose SGEquiDiff, a crystal generative model which naturally handles space group constraints with space group invariant likelihoods. SGEquiDiff consists of an SE(3)-invariant, telescoping discrete sampler of crystal lattices; permutation-invariant, transformer-based autoregressive sampling of Wyckoff positions, elements, and numbers of symmetrically unique atoms; and space group equivariant diffusion of atomic coordinates. We show that space group equivariant vector fields automatically live in the tangent spaces of the Wyckoff positions. SGEquiDiff achieves state-of-the-art performance on standard benchmark datasets as assessed by quantitative proxy metrics and quantum mechanical calculations.

Title: Neutron Spin Resonance Near a Lifshitz Transition in Overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$
Authors: Yang Li, Dingsong Wu, Yingjie Shu, Bo Liu, Uwe Stuhr, Guochu Deng, Anton P. J. Stamp, Lin Zhao, Xingjiang Zhou, Shiliang Li, Amit Pokhriyal, Haranath Ghosh, Wenshan Hong, Huiqian Luo
Abstract: Elucidating the relationship between spin excitations and fermiology is essential for clarifying the pairing mechanism in iron-based superconductors (FeSCs). Here, we report inelastic neutron scattering results on the hole overdoped Ba$_{0.4}$K$_{0.6}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ near a Lifshitz transition, where the electron pocket at $M$ point is nearly replace by four hole pockets. In the normal state, the spin excitations are observed at incommensurate wave vectors with chimney-like dispersions. By cooling down to the superconducting state, a neutron spin resonance mode emerges with a peak energy of $E_r=$ 14-15 meV weakly modulated along $L$-direction. The incommensurability notably increases at low energies, giving rise to downward dispersions of the resonance mode. This behavior contrasts sharply with the upward dispersions of resonance observed in optimally doped Ba$_{0.67}$K$_{0.33}$Fe$_2$As$_2$ contributed by the hole to electron scattering, but resembles with the cases in KFe$_2$As$_2$ and KCa$_2$Fe$_4$As$_4$F$_2$ where the fermiology are dominated by hole pockets. These results highlight the critical role of electronic structure modifications near the Fermi level, especially in governing interband scattering under imperfect nesting conditions, which fundamentally shape the spin dynamics of FeSCs.

Title: Stabilization of a polar phase in WO3 thin films by epitaxial strain

Abstract: The introduction of new simple oxides that are CMOS-compatible constitutes an important step towards multifunctional oxide electronics. One such oxide, tungsten trioxide (WO3), has raised much interest as an electrode material. Here we reveal the presence of a previously unreported polar phase of WO3, obtained in thin films grown on YAlO3 substrates. The epitaxial strain stabilizes a triclinic phase, whose unit cell could be fully determined by means of large-scale reciprocal space mapping, rarely reported in thin films. Unconventional strain accommodation mechanisms enable the triclinic phase to be stabilized up to unexpectedly large film thicknesses. The strain gradients around domain walls and local variations of octahedral tilts, observed by scanning transmission electron microscopy, could explain this behavior. An in-plane striped domain pattern with needle-like bifurcations is visible in piezoresponse force microscopy maps, evidencing the polar nature of the films. Correspondingly, local modulations of the conductivity of the film are shown by conductive atomic force microscopy and scanning electron microscopy. These results open the possibility for adding functionalities to WO3-based devices by controlling conductivity and epitaxial strain.

Title: Dimensionality dependence of diffusion-entropy scaling: Sensitivity to the diffusion mechanism
Authors: Nayana Venkatareddy, Mohd Moid, Prabal K. Maiti, Biman Bagchi
Abstract: While entropy quantifies the volume of the accessible phase space, diffusion characterizes the rate of its exploration, capturing distinct yet interconnected aspects of a system's dynamics. In this Letter, we employ computer simulations to independently compute D and S for Lennard-Jones (LJ) liquid and water in two and three dimensions, and for water also in one dimension, across a broad range of thermodynamic states. We observe that the ratio of diffusion coefficients between two states exhibits a nearly perfect exponential dependence on their entropy difference. For LJ liquids, the prefactor of the exponential shows a strong dimensionality dependence, consistent in trend but quantitatively different from theoretical predictions. In contrast, water displays a remarkably weak dimensionality dependence, deviating from theoretical expectations, which we attribute to the dominant role of jump diffusion. Surprisingly, the exponential diffusion-entropy relationship persists even when translational and rotational contributions to entropy are considered separately, underscoring the robustness of the D-S relation across different degrees of freedom.

Title: Delayed Active Swimmer in a Velocity Landscape
Authors: Viktor Holubec, Giovanni Volpe, Frank Cichos
Abstract: Self-propelled active particles exhibit delayed responses to environmental changes, modulating their propulsion speed through intrinsic sensing and feedback mechanisms. This adaptive behavior fundamentally determines their dynamics and self-organization in active matter systems, with implications for biological microswimmers and engineered microrobots. Here, we investigate active Brownian particles whose propulsion speed is governed by spatially varying activity landscapes, incorporating a temporal delay between environmental sensing and speed adaptation. Through analytical solutions derived for both short-time and long-time delay regimes, we demonstrate that steady-state density and polarization profiles exhibit maxima at characteristic delays. Significantly, we observe that the polarization profile undergoes sign reversal when the swimming distance during the delay time exceeds the characteristic diffusion length, providing a novel mechanism for controlling particle transport without external fields. Our theoretical predictions, validated through experimental observations and numerical simulations, establish time delay as a crucial control parameter for particle transport and organization in active matter systems. These findings provide insights into how biological microorganisms might use response delays to gain navigation advantages and suggest design principles for synthetic microswimmers with programmable responses to heterogeneous environments.

Title: Angle-dependent resonant tunneling and thermoelectric energy management in a hybrid 1D-2D-1D semiconductor nanostructure
Authors: Xiaoguang Luo, Jiaming Wang, Jiawen Dai, Junqiang Zhang, Nian Liu
Abstract: Low-dimensional semiconductors have been widely exploited in thermoelectric energy conversion for high efficiencies due to their suppressed lattice thermal conduction, sharply defined electronic density of states, and tunable energy-selective electron transmission. However, the widespread challenge of Fermi-level pinning or doping constraints limit precise control over thermoelectric energy management via chemical potential modulation. Here, we proposed an alternative strategy: leveraging angle-dependent electron incidence to dynamically manipulate electron transmission and heat transport, which was implemented theoretically in a two-dimensional InP/InAs/InP double-barrier heterostructure integrated with laterally one-dimensional electrodes. By combining the transfer matrix method and Landauer formalism, we demonstrated the angle-dependent resonant tunneling dynamics, tunable negative differential resistance effect, and near-Carnot limits in thermoelectric energy conversions. Angular modulation enables precise control over transmission resonances, facilitating dynamic transitions among thermoelectric regimes (power generation, cooling, and hybrid heating) without requiring extreme chemical potential shifts. This work establishes angularly resolved electron transmission as a versatile mechanism for on-chip thermal management and cryogenic applications, offering a pathway to circumvent material limitations in next-generation nanoelectronics and quantum devices.

Title: Scalable thru-hole epitaxy of GaN through self-adjusting $h$-BN masks via solution-processed 2D stacks
Authors: Jongwoo Ha, Minah Choi, Jieun Yang, Chinkyo Kim
Abstract: Selective epitaxy on 2D-material masks is a promising pathway for achieving localized, defect-suppressed GaN growth, but conventional 2D transfer processes limit scalability and interface control. Here, we demonstrate a thru-hole epitaxy (THE) method that enables vertically connected and laterally overgrown GaN domains through a spin-coated, solution-processed stack of hexagonal boron nitride ($h$-BN) flakes. The disordered $h$-BN mask exhibits a self-adjusting structure during growth, which locally reconfigures to allow percolative precursor transport and coherent GaN nucleation beneath otherwise blocking layers. Comprehensive structural analyses using scanning electron microscopy, Raman mapping, and high-resolution transmission electron microscopy confirm both the presence of epitaxial GaN beneath the h-BN and suppression of threading dislocations. This strategy eliminates the need for patterned 2D mask transfers and demonstrates a scalable route to selective-area GaN growth on arbitrary substrates, relevant to future micro-LED and photonic integration platforms.

Title: Investigation of the spin dynamics of quantum spin dimers with Dzyaloshinsky-Moriya interaction
Authors: R. Wieser, R. Sanchez-Galan
Abstract: We investigate the ground state configuration and spin dynamics of a quantum spin spiral dimer when a magnetic field is applied to one of its constituent spins. By adiabatic changing the magnetic field, it is possible to change the non-magnetic ground state to a classical spiral state, which oscillates periodically to its inverted classical spiral state configuration. This oscillation can be halted at any time, leading to the possibility of manipulating the quantum state and the magnetic configuration of the spin dimer. Notably, this idea is not limited to spin dimers and can also be extended to quantum spin chains with an even number of spins.

Title: On the Nature of the Fundamental Plasma Excitation in a Plasmonic Crystal

Abstract: We report on the experimental study of the spectrum of plasma excitations in a plasmonic crystal fabricated from the two-dimensional electron system in an AlGaAs/GaAs semiconductor heterostructure. Our results reveal that the plasmonic crystal supports only a single fundamental plasma mode, challenging the current theoretical understanding that anticipates multiple modes. This unexpected finding is supported by comprehensive research on the mode frequency and relaxation as a function of the gate width across different plasmonic crystal periods. Furthermore, we develop an analytical approach that accurately describes the behavior of plasma excitations in plasmonic crystals, providing new insights into the fundamental physics of plasmonic systems.

Title: Non-Ohmic behavior in (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$ by Joule heating
Authors: Sofie Kölling, Daan H. Wielens, İnanç Adagideli, Alexander Brinkman
Abstract: A prerequisite to using the net spin polarization generated by a source-drain bias in three-dimensional topological insulators for spintronic applications, is understanding how such a bias alters the transport properties of these materials. At low temperatures, quantum corrections can dominate the temperature dependence of the resistance. Although a DC bias does not break time-reversal symmetry and is therefore not expected to suppress quantum corrections, an increase of the electron temperature due to Joule heating can cause a suppression. This suppression at finite bias can lead to a non-Ohmic differential resistance in the three-dimensional topological insulator (Bi$_{1-x}$Sb$_x$)$_2$Te$_3$, consisting of a zero-bias resistance peak (from electron-electron interactions) and a high-bias background (from weak antilocalization). We show that the bias voltage dependence of quantum corrections can be mapped to the temperature dependence, while the heating effect on the lattice temperature remains small. When searching for non-Ohmic effects due to novel phenomena in three-dimensional topological insulators, Joule heating should not be overlooked.

Title: Piezomagnetic effect in 5$d$ transition metal oxides Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$ with all-in/all-out magnetic order
Authors: Hiroki Nanjo, Yoshinori Imai, Takuya Aoyama, Junichi Yamaura, Kenya Ohgushi
Abstract: We investigated the piezomagnetic effect in pyrochlore-type oxides Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$ and Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$, which show a non-coplanar magnetic structure called the all-in/all-out antiferromagnetic order at low temperatures. The all-in/all-out magnetic order can be viewed as a ferroic order of the $xyz$-type magnetic octupoles. We observed a linear development of magnetization with applying stress for both materials. We then estimated the powder-averaged piezomagnetic tensor at 50 K to be $Q = 5.74 \times 10^{-6}$ $\mu_{\text{B}}$/Ir$\cdot$MPa for Y$_2$Ir$_2$O$_7$, and $Q = 3.49 \times 10^{-7}$ $\mu_{\text{B}}$/Os$\cdot$MPa for Cd$_2$Os$_2$O$_7$. We discuss the microscopic mechanism of the piezomagnetic effect in terms of the stress-induced modification of the g-tensor anisotropy and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (D-M) interactions. This work paves the way for the further development of piezomagnetic materials using a strategy based on magnetic multipoles.

Title: Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal
Authors: N. U. Sakamoto, G. Nozue, H. Fujiwara, Y. Torii, M. Sakaguchi, T. D. Nakamura, T. Kiss, H. Sugawara, S. Tanaka, Y. Iwasaki, Y. Niwa, A. Ishikawa, T. D. Yamamoto, R. Tamura, A. Yasui, A. Sekiyama
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.

Title: Charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals in the normal state of the Emery model
Authors: G. L. Reaney, N. Kowalski, A.-M. S. Tremblay, G. Sordi
Abstract: Unraveling the behavior of the electrons in the copper-oxygen planes of cuprate superconductors remains a challenge. Here we examine the electronic charge redistribution among planar copper and oxygen orbitals and the charge gap using the Emery model in the normal state, solved with cellular dynamical mean-field theory at finite temperature. We quantify the charge redistribution as a function of the onsite Coulomb repulsion on the copper orbitals, the bare copper-oxygen energy difference, and the hole or electron doping. We find that the position relative to the metal to insulator boundary of the Zaanen-Sawatzky-Allen diagram determines the charge redistribution among copper and oxygen orbitals. For a fixed bare Cu-O energy difference, an increase in the Cu electron repulsion leads to a transfer of the electronic charge from Cu to O orbitals. For a fixed charge gap size of the undoped state, as the system evolves from a charge-transfer to a Mott-Hubbard regime, the electronic charge is transferred from Cu to O orbitals. Our findings posit the Coulomb repulsion and the bare charge-transfer energy as key drivers of the microscopic process of charge redistribution in the CuO$_2$ plane. They quantify the anticorrelation between the charge gap size and oxygen hole content. They show that for fixed band-structure parameters, the charge gap and the charge redistribution between Cu and O orbitals provide a way to understand observed trends in cuprates.

Title: Numerical Block-Diagonalization and Linked Cluster Expansion for Deriving Effective Hamiltonians: Applications to Spin Excitations
Authors: Tsutomu Momoi, Owen Benton
Abstract: We present a non-perturbative framework for deriving effective Hamiltonians that describe low-energy excitations in quantum many-body systems. The method combines block diagonalization based on the Cederbaum--Schirmer--Meyer transformation with the numerical linked-cluster (NLC) expansion. A key feature of the approach is a variational criterion that uniquely determines the unitary transformation by minimizing the transformation of the state basis within the low-energy subspace. This criterion also provides a robust guideline for selecting relevant eigenstates, even in the presence of avoided level crossing and mixing induced by particle-number-nonconserving interactions. We demonstrate the method in two quantum spin models: the one-dimensional transverse-field Ising model and the two-dimensional Shastry--Sutherland model, relevant to SrCu$_2$(BO$_3$)$_2$. In both cases, the derived effective Hamiltonians faithfully reproduce the structure and dynamics of magnon and triplon excitations, including the emergence of topological band structures. The block diagonalization enables quantum fluctuations to be incorporated non-perturbatively, while the NLC expansion systematically accounts for finite-size corrections from larger clusters. This approach naturally generates long-range effective interactions near criticality, even when the original Hamiltonian includes only short-range couplings. The proposed framework provides a general and computationally feasible tool for constructing physically meaningful effective models across a broad range of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Chemically active droplets in crowded environments
Authors: Jacques Fries, Roxanne Berthin, Chengjie Luo, Marie Jardat, David Zwicker, Vincent Dahirel, Pierre Illien
Abstract: Biomolecular condensates are essential for cellular organization and result from phase separation in systems far from thermodynamic equilibrium. Among various models, chemically active droplets play a significant role, consisting of proteins that switch between attractive and repulsive states via nonequilibrium chemical reactions. While field-based simulations have provided insights into their behavior, these coarse-grained approaches fail to capture molecular-scale effects, particularly in crowded cellular environments. Macromolecular crowding, a key feature of intracellular organization, strongly influences molecular transport within condensates, yet its quantitative impact remains underexplored. This study investigates the interplay between chemically active droplets and crowders by using particle-based models, that provide molecular insight, and a field-based model, that complements this picture. Surprisingly, crowding reduces droplet size while expanding the overall dense phase volume, challenging equilibrium-based expectations. This effect arises from the interplay between depletion interactions, diffusion hindrance, and nonequilibrium particle fluxes. Our findings provide a step towards a more comprehensive understanding of chemically active droplets in complex, realistic cellular environments.

Title: Emergent Thermalization Thresholds in Unitary Dynamics of Inhomogeneously Disordered Systems
Authors: Soumya Kanti Pal, C L Sriram, Shamik Gupta
Abstract: Inspired by the avalanche scenario for many-body localization (MBL) instability, we reverse the conventional set-up and ask whether a large weakly-disordered chain can thermalize a smaller, strongly-disordered chain when the composite system evolves unitarily. Using transport as a dynamical probe, we identify three distinct thermalization regimes as a function of the disorder strength of the smaller chain: (i) complete thermalization with self-averaging at weak disorder, (ii) realization-dependent thermalization with strong sample-to-sample fluctuations at intermediate disorder, and (iii) absence of thermalization at strong disorder. We find that the non-self-averaging regime broadens with the size of the weakly-disordered chain, revealing a nuanced interplay between disorder and system size. These results highlight how inhomogeneous disorder can induce emergent thermalization thresholds in closed quantum systems, providing direct access to disorder regimes where thermalization or its absence can be reliably observed.

Title: Anisotropic magnetic phase diagrams, tricriticality, and spin-reorientation in high-pressure grown SmCrO$_3$ single crystals
Authors: Ning Yuan, Erik Walendy, Nour Maraytta, Waldemar Hergett, Luca Bischof, Michael Merz, Rüdiger Klingeler
Abstract: SmCrO$_3$ single crystals were successfully grown utilizing the high-pressure optical floating-zone method and their crystal structure, magnetization behavior, and magnetic phase diagrams were thoroughly investigated. Magnetic studies were conducted for fields applied along all principal crystallographic directions, with measurements taken at temperatures as low as 0.4 K and magnetic fields up to 14 T. The single crystal growth parameters are reported and the orthorhombic structure with the centrosymmetric space group $Pbnm$ is confirmed. Long-range order of the Cr$^{3+}$ and Sm$^{3+}$ magnetic sublattices evolves at $T_{\rm N}$ = 192 K and $T_{\rm N2}$=3 K, respectively. In contrast to previous studies on polycrystals our single crystal data imply a discontinuous and one-step spin-reorientation (SR) of net magnetic moments $\tilde{M}$ from the $c$ axis into the $ab$ plane at zero magnetic field at $T_{\rm SR}$=33 K. Its discontinuous nature is maintained if $B$ is applied $||c$ axis but tricritical behavior and a triple point is found for $B||a$ axis. While our data are consistent with the magnetic representation $\Gamma_4$ for $T > T_{\mathrm {SR}}$, the size and in-plane direction of the observed net magnetic moment disagree to previously proposed spin configurations, i.e., $\Gamma_1$ and $\Gamma_2$, for the spin-reoriented phases. In general, our high-quality single crystals enable us to revisit the phase diagram and to clarify the complex magnetism in SmCrO3 arising from the interplay of anisotropic 3$d$ and 4$f$ magnetic sublattices.

Title: Resistivity of non-Galilean invariant two dimensional Dirac system
Authors: V. M. Kovalev, M. V. Entin, Z. D. Kvon, A. D. Levin, V. A. Chitta, G. M. Gusev, N. N. Mikhailov
Abstract: We revisited the influence of electron-electron scattering on the resistivity of a two-dimensional system with linear spectrum. In conventional systems with parabolic spectrum, where Umklapp scattering is either prohibited or ineffective due to small Fermi surface, particle-particle scattering does not contribute to conductivity because it does not change the total momentum. However, within the framework of Boltzmann kinetic model, we demonstrate that electron-electron scattering in Dirac systems can significantly contribute to conductivity, producing distinct temperature-dependent corrections: a T\textsuperscript{4} behavior at low temperatures and T\textsuperscript{2} dependence at moderate temperatures. While the predicted T\textsuperscript{4} scaling is not observed experimentally -- likely suppressed by dominant weak localization effects -- the T\textsuperscript{2} scaling is clearly confirmed in our measurements. Specifically, temperature-dependent resistivity data from gapless single-valley HgTe quantum well exhibit T\textsuperscript{2} corrections, which align well with theoretical predictions. Thus, we challenge the paradigm that T\textsuperscript{2} term in resistivity is absent in single-band 2D metals.

Title: Linear Magnetoresistance and Anomalous Hall Effect in the Superconductor NiBi$_{3}$
Authors: Gabriel Sant'ana, Jully Paola Peña Pacheco, David Mockli, Fabiano Mesquita da Rosa, Sergio Garcia Magalhães, Paulo Pureur, Milton A. Tumelero
Abstract: The NiBi$_{3}$ compound exhibits an intriguing interplay of superconductivity, magnetism, and topology. While the possibility of unconventional superconductivity involving magnetic interactions has been previously discussed and dismissed, the topological character of its electronic structure has only recently gained attention. Here, we report experimental evidence of unconventional magnetic ordering in high-quality single crystals of NiBi$_{3}$, revealed through detailed magnetotransport measurements. The magnetoresistance shows a distinct temperature dependence, combining a classical Lorentz-like component with a linear-in-field contribution. Moreover, anomalous Hall effect signals persist down to the superconducting transition and vanish above 75 K. These results indicate that spin textures significantly influence charge transport in NiBi$_{3}$, pointing to a compensated magnetic background intertwined with its topological electronic structure. Our findings underscore the complex and multifaceted nature of this material.

Title: Born-limit scattering and pair-breaking crossover in d-wave superconductivity of (TMTSF)2ClO4
Authors: Shota Yano, Kazumi Fukushima, Katsuki Kinjo, Soichiro Yamane, Le Hong Hoàng To, Pascale Senzier, Cécile Mézière, Shamashis Sengupta, Claire A Marrache-Kikuchi, Denis Jerome, Shingo Yonezawa
Abstract: In the quasi-one-dimensional organic unconventional superconductor (TMTSF)2ClO4, the randomness of the non-centrosymmetric ClO4 anions can be experimentally controlled by adjusting the cooling rate through the anion-ordering temperature. This feature provides a unique opportunity to study disorder effects on unconventional superconductivity in great detail. We here report on measurements of the electronic specific heat of this system, performed under various cooling rates. The evolution of the residual density of states indicates that the ClO4 randomness works as Born-limit pair breakers, which, to our knowledge, has never been clearly identified in any unconventional superconductors. Furthermore, detailed analyses suggest a peculiar crossover from strong unitarity scattering due to molecular defects toward the Born-limit weak scattering due to borders of ordered regions. This work supports the d-wave nature of pairing in (TMTSF)2ClO4 and intends to provide an experimental basis for further developments of pair-breaking theories of unconventional superconductors where multiple electron scattering mechanisms coexist.

Title: Theory of Quasi-Statically Screened Electron-Polar Optical Phonon Scattering
Authors: Yuji Go, Rajeev Dutt, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: The scattering of electrons with polar optical phonons (POP) is an important mechanism that limits electronic transport and determines electron mobility in polar materials. This is typically a stronger mechanism compared to non-polar acoustic and optical phonon scattering, and of similar strength to the Coulomb ionized impurity scattering. At high densities, on the other hand, the cloud of charge carriers screens the dipoles that are responsible for POP scattering, and weakens the electron-POP scattering strength. However, in contrast to ionized impurity scattering, for which the well-known Brooks-Herring equation provides the scattering rates with the effect of screening included, for scattering with POP there is no such closed-form mathematical expression. In this work, we derive such an expression based on Fermi's Golden Rule, which would prove particularly useful in understanding electronic transport in complex crystal and complex band structure materials, in which electron-POP scattering could dominate electronic transport.

Title: Lattice models with subsystem/weak non-invertible symmetry-protected topological order
Authors: Yuki Furukawa
Abstract: We construct a family of lattice models which possess subsystem non-invertible symmetry-protected topological (SPT) order and analyze their interface modes protected by the symmetry, whose codimension turns out to be more than one. We also propose 2+1d lattice models which belong to two different weak SPT phases distinguished by a combination of translational symmetry and non-invertible symmetry. We show that the interface between them exhibits an exotic Lieb-Schultz-Mattis anomaly coming from the symmetry which cannot be written as a direct product of an internal symmetry and the lattice translational symmetry.

Title: Combined Experimental and Computational Analysis of Lithium Diffusion in Isostructural Pair VNb9O25 and VTa9O25
Authors: Manish Kumar, Md Abdullah Al Muhit, CJ Sturgill, Nima Karimitari, John T. Barber, Hunter Tisdale, Morgan Stefik, Hans-Conrad zur Loye, Christopher Sutton
Abstract: Wadsley-Roth crystal structures are an attractive class of materials for batteries because lithium diffusion is facilitated by the ReO3-like block structure with electron transport enabled by edge-sharing along shear planes. However, clear structure-property relationships remain limited, making it challenging to develop improved materials. Here, the first lithiation of VTa9O25 is reported, enabling a direct isostructural comparison with the better-known VNb9O25. These materials have similar unit cell volumes and atomic radii yet exhibit different voltage windows, C-rate dependent capacities, and transport metrics. Time-dependent overpotential analysis reveals ionic diffusion as the primary bottleneck to high rate-performance in both cases, however, the lithium diffusivity for VNb9O25 was an order of magnitude faster than that for VTa9O25. These experimental trends aligned well with density functional theory calculations combined with molecular dynamics that show a factor of six faster diffusion in VNb9O25. Nudged elastic band calculations of the probable hopping pathways indicate that VNb9O25 consistently exhibits a lower activation barrier for lithium diffusion. Bader charge analysis reveals a larger net charge on Li in VNb9O25 due to the higher electronegativity of Nb which stabilizes the transition state and lowers the barrier. This stabilization arises from the stronger Coulombic interaction between Li and its coordinated O-environment. These materials behave similarly upon lithiation wherein the lattice vectors (corresponding to the block plane) increase until about 50% lithiation and then decrease. However, the electronic structure differs, indicating that VNb9O25 undergoes a insulator to metal transition at a lower state of charge compared with VTa9O25. Overall, this work establishes the role of the cation (Nb or Ta) on the electronic and transport properties during lithiation.

Title: The fate of the Fermi surface coupled to a single-wave-vector cavity mode
Authors: Bernhard Frank, Michele Pini, Johannes Lang, Francesco Piazza
Abstract: The electromagnetic field of standing-wave or ring cavities induces a spatially modulated, infinite-range interaction between atoms in an ultracold Fermi gas, with a single wavelength comparable to the Fermi length. This interaction has no analog in other systems of itinerant particles and has so far been studied only in the regime where it is attractive at zero distance. Here, we fully solve the problem of competing instabilities of the Fermi surface induced by single-wavelength interactions. We find that while the density-wave (superradiant) instability dominates on the attractive side, it is absent for repulsive interactions, where the competition is instead won by non-superradiant superfluid phases at low temperatures, with Fermion pairs forming at both vanishing and finite center-of-mass momentum. Moreover, even in the absence of such symmetry-breaking instabilities, we find the Fermi surface to be always nontrivially deformed from an isotropic shape. We estimate this full phenomenology to be within reach of dedicated state-of-the-art experimental setups.

Title: Magnetostriction and Temperature Dependent Gilbert Damping in Boron Doped Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$ Thin Films
Authors: Zhixin Zhang, Jinho Lim, Haoyang Ni, Jian-Min Zuo, Axel Hoffmann
Abstract: Magnetic thin films with strong magnetoelastic coupling and low Gilbert damping are key materials for many magnetoelectric devices. Here, we investigated the effects of boron doping concentration on magnetostriction and temperature dependent Gilbert damping in magnetron sputtered (Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$)$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ films. A crystalline to amorphous structural transition was observed for a boron content near 8% and coincided with a decrease in coercivity from 76 Oe to 3 Oe. A 10% doping concentration is optimal for achieving both large magnetostriction of 48.8 ppm and low Gilbert damping of $6 \times 10^{-3}$. The temperature dependence of the damping shows an increase at low temperatures with a peak around 40 K and we associate the relative increase $\Delta\alpha/\alpha_{RT}$ with magnetoelastic contributions to the damping, which has a maximum of 55.7% at 8% boron. An increase in the inhomogeneous linewidth broadening was observed in the structural transition regime at about 8% boron concentration. This study suggests that incorporation of glass forming elements, in this case boron, into Fe$_{80}$Ga$_{20}$ is a practical pathway for simultaneously achieving enhanced magnetoelastic coupling and reduced Gilbert damping.

Title: Exactly solvable many-body dynamics from space-time duality
Authors: Bruno Bertini, Pieter W. Claeys, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: Recent years have seen significant advances, both theoretical and experimental, in our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics. Given this problem's high complexity, it is surprising that a substantial amount of this progress can be ascribed to exact analytical results. Here we review dual-unitary circuits as a particular setting leading to exact results in quantum many-body dynamics. Dual-unitary circuits constitute minimal models in which space and time are treated on an equal footings, yielding exactly solvable yet possibly chaotic evolution. They were the first in which current notions of quantum chaos could be analytically quantified, allow for a full characterisation of the dynamics of thermalisation, scrambling, and entanglement (among others), and can be experimentally realised in current quantum simulators. Dual-unitarity is a specific fruitful implementation of the more general idea of space-time duality in which the roles of space and time are exchanged to access relevant dynamical properties of quantum many-body systems.

Title: Electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C cathode for low-cost sodium-ion batteries
Authors: Madhav Sharma, Rajendra S. Dhaka
Abstract: We report the electrochemical performance and diffusion kinetics of a newly designed NASICON type Na$_{3.3}$Mn$_{1.2}$Ti$_{0.75}$Mo$_{0.05}$(PO$_4$)$_3$/C composite material as a cathode for cost-effective sodium-ion batteries. A novel strategy of small Mo doping successfully stabilizes the sample having high Mn content in single phase rhombohedral symmerty. The high-resolution microscopy analysis reveals nanocrystallites of around $\sim$18 nm, uniformly embedded within the semi-graphitic carbon matrix, which enhances the surface electronic conductivity and effectively shortens the sodium-ion diffusion path. More importantly, we demonstrate a stable electrochemical behavior, with enhanced discharge capacity of 124 mAh/g at 0.1 C, having good reversibility and retaining 77\% of its capacity after 300 cycles, and 70\% even after 400 cycles at 2 C. The sodium-ion diffusion coefficients, estimated using both galvanostatic intermittent titration technique (GITT) and cyclic voltammetry are found to lie within the range of $10^{-9}$ to $10^{-11}$~cm$^2$/s. Additionally, the bond-valence site energy mapping predicted a sodium-ion migration energy barrier of 0.76 eV. A detailed distribution of relaxation times (DRT) analysis is used to deconvolute the electrochemical impedance spectra into distinct processes based on their characteristic relaxation times. Notably, the solid-state diffusion of sodium ions within the bulk electrode, with a relaxation time of $\sim$50 s, shows a consistent trend with the diffusion coefficients obtained from GITT and Warburg-based evaluations across the state of charge.

Title: Is diamagnetism really acausal?
Authors: Niclas Westerberg, Stephen M. Barnett
Abstract: Diamagnetism, in which the magnetisation in a medium opposes the direction of an applied magnetic field, is a weak but familiar effect in a wide class of materials. Being weak it is also a linear response to any applied field. The problem is that the existence of diamagnetism is in direct conflict with the requirements of causality as embodied in the familiar Kramers-Kronig relations. Nature does not care about our confusion and diamagnetism exists and physics is constrained by the requirements of causality (that effect cannot precede its cause). This puzzle has received intermittent attention from time to time, with a variety of arguments made to resolve the paradox. None of these, no matter how plausible, reveal the mechanism that resolves the existence of diamagnetism without sacrificing causality. The full resolution is presented in this letter.

Title: A differential equation for a class of correlation kernels
Authors: Clifford V. Johnson
Abstract: A new differential equation is derived for an object ${\widehat S}(E,E^\prime,x)$, which when integrated over the appropriate range in $x$, yields the kernel $K(E,E^\prime)$ with which $n$-point correlation functions can be computed in a wide class of models. When $E{=}E^\prime$, the equation reduces to the equation for the diagonal resolvent ${\widehat R}(E,x)$ of the Schrödinger Hamiltonian ${H}{=}{-}\hbar^2\partial_x^2{+}u(x)$ that is familiar from the classic work of Gel'fand and Dikii, and which appears in many areas of physics. This more general equation may also prove to be useful in a wide range of applications. Some special cases relevant to random matrix theory are explored using analytical and numerical methods.

Title: Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks
Authors: Matija Tečer, Giuseppe Calajó, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.

Title: Temporal coherence of single photons emitted by hexagonal Boron Nitride defects at room temperature
Authors: J.-V. Vidal Martínez-Pons, S.-K. Kim, M. Behrens, A. Izquierdo-Molina, A. Menendez Rua, S. Paçal, S. Ateş, L. Viña, C. Antón-Solanas
Abstract: Color centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) emerge as promising quantum light sources at room temperature, with potential applications in quantum communications, among others. The temporal coherence of emitted photons (i.e. their capacity to interfere and distribute photonic entanglement) is essential for many of these applications. Hence, it is crucial to study and determine the temporal coherence of this emission under different experimental conditions. In this work, we report the coherence time of the single photons emitted by an hBN defect in a nanocrystal at room temperature, measured via Michelson interferometry. The visibility of this interference vanishes when the temporal delay between the interferometer arms is a few hundred femtoseconds, highlighting that the phonon dephasing processes are four orders of magnitude faster than the spontaneous decay time of the emitter. We also analyze the single photon characteristics of the emission via correlation measurements, defect blinking dynamics, and its Debye-Waller factor. Our room temperature results highlight the presence of a strong phonon-electron coupling, suggesting the need to work at cryogenic temperatures to enable quantum photonic applications based on photon interference.

Title: Surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space
Authors: Davood Shahsavari, Luis Dorfmann, Prashant Saxena
Abstract: We evaluate the conditions for surface stability of a layered magnetoelastic half-space subjected to large deformations and a magnetic field. After reviewing the fundamental measures of deformation and summarizing the magnetostatic equations in Eulerian and Lagrangian forms, we derive the constitutive relations from a total energy function dependent on the deformation gradient and Lagrangian magnetic induction. Energy principles yield the equilibrium equations, magnetic field equations, and boundary conditions. The second variation of the energy functional provides the incremental equations and conditions for stability analysis. Surface instability is studied by linearizing increments of deformation and magnetic induction about a finitely deformed state under a magnetic field normal to the surface. Four illustrative cases are considered: (i) a layered non-magnetizable half-space with varying stiffness contrast; (ii) the critical stretch of a magnetoelastic half-space as a function of magnetic induction; (iii) surface stability of a magneto-sensitive layer atop a non-magnetizable substrate; and (iv) bifurcation conditions in a two-layered magnetoelastic solid with different stiffness ratios. Graphical results are provided throughout.

Title: Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion
Authors: Huatian Hu, Zhiwei Hu, Christophe Galland, Wen Chen
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-in-slit (NPiS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPiS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.

Abstract: We present a laser reaction chamber that we developed for in-situ/operando X-ray diffraction measurements at the NSLS-II 28-ID-2 XPD (X-Ray Powder Diffraction) beamline. This chamber allows for rapid and dynamic sample heating under specialized gas environments, spanning ambient conditions down to vacuum pressures. We demonstrate the capabilities of this setup through two applications: laser-driven heating in polycrystalline iron oxide and in single crystal WTe2. Our measurements reveal the ability to resolve chemical reaction kinetics over minutes with 1-s time resolution. This setup advances opportunities for in-situ/operando XRD studies in both bulk and single crystal materials.

Authors: A. Shahid, J. Gum, R. Unnithan, S. Mokkapati
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials, specifically transition metal dichalcogenides, for highly sensitive gas sensing are emerging as effective detection technology. Platinum ditelluride (PtTe2) is an intriguing material in the realm of field-effect transistors (FETs) due to its unique electronic properties. In this study, the CVDsynthesized PtTe2 was functionalized with Au-Pd thin film for analyte-specific (H2S) sensing for better toxic gas sensitivity and selectivity. It was concluded that PtTe2, in combination with appropriate metal or oxide decorations, had great potential for ultrasensitive and selective, real-time gas sensor applications.

Title: Single Vanadium Dioxide Nanoparticle-Enabled Plasmonic switch with Thermal and Electronic Reconfigurability
Authors: Gregory Tanyi, Daniel Peace, Han-Hao Cheng, Guanghui Ren, Xuan Hiep Dinh, Mohammed Taha, Arnan Mitchell, Karsten Hoehn, Christina Lim, Ranjith Unnithan
Abstract: We present an integrated switch that combines plasmonic and neuromorphic technologies with a single sub-stoichiometric VO2-x nanoparticle. The presented device acts as a versatile plasmonic switch with dual thermal and electrical reconfigurability leveraging the near-room temperature phase transition of the VO2-x nanoparticles combined with the rapid phase recovery to drive the device. The change in both the optical and electrical properties of the VO2-x nanoparticle enables simultaneous optical and electrical readouts making the plasmonic device suitable as a phase change memory cell which is crucial in the convergence of computing and communication technologies. Our demonstration of reversible electrical switching, evidenced by a 6dB modulation depth and concurrent optical and electrical outputs, signifies a major stride in merging electronic and photonic functionalities within phase-change material devices. This novel strategy not only harmonizes optical communication with electronic computing but also advances the development of sophisticated integrated neuromorphic devices.

Title: Structure and dynamics of ionic liquids under shear flow
Authors: Abbas Gholami, Sebastian Kloth, Zhen-Hao Xu, Kurt Kremer, Michael Vogel, Torsten Stuehn, Joseph F. Rudzinski
Abstract: We investigate the intrinsic behavior of ionic liquids under shear flow, using a coarse-grained model of C4mim-PF6 as a prototypical example. The importance of long-ranged electrostatics is assessed as a function of shear rate by comparing Ewald and reaction field treatments. An appropriate comparison is achieved through the implementation of the proper Lees-Edwards boundary conditions within the ESPResSo++ simulation software. Our results demonstrate that while structural properties are relatively insensitive to the electrostatic treatment, the more accurate treatment via the Ewald approach is essential for studies of dynamics, in particular, at lower shear rates. Furthermore, we identify a critical shear rate beyond which structural and dynamical properties begin to deviate from equilibrium behavior, while remaining largely unchanged below this threshold. Finally, we demonstrate that the dynamic heterogeneity of the liquid decreases as a function of increasing shear rate, which can be primarily explained by the faster dynamics induced by the shear flow. These results hold relevance for investigations of process-dependent properties of ionic-liquid-based materials.

Title: Walsh-Floquet Theory of Periodic Kick Drives
Authors: James Walkling, Marin Bukov
Abstract: Periodic kick drives are ubiquitous in digital quantum control, computation, and simulation, and are instrumental in studies of chaos and thermalization for their efficient representation through discrete gates. However, in the commonly used Fourier basis, kick drives lead to poor convergence of physical quantities. Instead, here we use the Walsh basis of periodic square-wave functions to describe the physics of periodic kick drives. In the strongly kicked regime, we find that it recovers Floquet dynamics of single- and many-body systems more accurately than the Fourier basis, due to the shape of the system's response in time. To understand this behavior, we derive an extended Sambe space formulation and an inverse-frequency expansion in the Walsh basis. We explain the enhanced performance within the framework of single-particle localization on the frequency lattice, where localization is correlated with small truncation errors. We show that strong hybridization between states of the kicked system and Walsh modes gives rise to Walsh polaritons that can be studied on digital quantum simulators. Our work lays the foundations of Walsh-Floquet theory, which is naturally implementable on digital quantum devices and suited to Floquet state manipulation using discrete gates.

Title: Second roton feature in the strongly coupled electron liquid
Authors: Thomas M. Chuna, Jan Vorberger, Panagiotis Tolias, Alexander Benedix Robles, Michael Hecht, Phil-Alexander Hofmann, Zhandos A. Moldabekov, Tobias Dornheim
Abstract: We present extensive \emph{ab initio} path integral Monte Carlo (PIMC) results for the dynamic properties of the finite temperature uniform electron gas (UEG) over a broad range of densities, $2\leq r_s\leq300$. We demonstrate that the direct analysis of the imaginary-time density--density correlation function (ITCF) allows for a rigorous assessment of the density and temperature dependence of the previously reported roton-type feature [T.~Dornheim, \emph{Phys.~Rev.~Lett.}~\textbf{121}, 255001 (2018)] at intermediate wavenumbers. We clearly resolve the emergence of a second roton at the second harmonic of the original feature for $r_s\gtrsim100$, which we identify as an incipient phonon dispersion. Finally, we use our highly accurate PIMC results for the ITCF as the basis for an analytic continuation to compute the dynamic structure factor, which additionally substantiates the existence of the second roton in the strongly coupled electron liquid. Our investigation further elucidates the complex interplay between quantum delocalization and Coulomb coupling in the UEG. All PIMC results are freely available online and provide valuable benchmarks for other theoretical methodologies and approximations.

Title: ForgetMeNot: Understanding and Modeling the Impact of Forever Chemicals Toward Sustainable Large-Scale Computing
Authors: Rohan Basu Roy, Raghavendra Kanakagiri, Yankai Jiang, Devesh Tiwari
Abstract: Fluorinated compounds, often referred to as forever chemicals, are critical in various steps of semiconductor fabrication like lithography, etching, chamber cleaning, and others. Forever chemical emissions can exhibit global warming potentials thousands of times greater than carbon dioxide and persist in the atmosphere for millennia. Despite their severe impact, most sustainability works in computer systems have focused on carbon emissions alone. We address this gap by introducing ForgetMeNot, a modeling tool that quantifies fluorinated compound emissions by integrating fabrication facility-specific practices and hardware specifications, and validate its accuracy using real-world emission data from fabrication facilities. We show how ForgetMeNot can enable fabrication facilities to optimize design and material usage decisions for emission reduction and provide researchers with a methodology to calibrate emission estimates for hardware designs. When ForgetMeNot is applied to analyze emissions for manufacturing CPUs, DRAM, and storage, it illustrates how hardware generations, lithography techniques, and capacities impact fluorinated compound emissions. Finally, we demonstrate how datacenter operators can assemble low-emission servers while balancing performance demands. By factoring in fluorinated emissions into manufacturing decisions, ForgetMeNot paves the way for building more sustainable systems.

Title: Diagrammatic expressions for steady-state distribution and static responses in population dynamics
Authors: Koya Katayama, Ryuna Nagayama, Sosuke Ito
Abstract: One of the fundamental questions in population dynamics is how biological populations respond to environmental perturbations. In population dynamics, the mean fitness and the fraction of a trait in the steady state are important because they indicate how well the trait and the population adapt to the environment. In this study, we examine the parallel mutation-reproduction model, which is one of the simplest models of an evolvable population. As an extension of the Markov chain tree theorem, we derive diagrammatic expressions for the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution of the population. For the parallel mutation-reproduction model, we consider self-loops, which represent trait reproduction and are excluded from the Markov chain tree theorem for the linear master equation. To generalize the theorem, we introduce the concept of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests, which generalize spanning trees with loops. We demonstrate that the weights of rooted $0$/$1$ loop forests yield the static responses of mean fitness and the steady-state distribution. Our results provide exact expressions for the static responses and the steady-state distribution. Additionally, we discuss approximations of these expressions in cases where reproduction or mutation is dominant. We provide numerical examples to illustrate these approximations and exact expressions.

Title: Where You Place the Norm Matters: From Prejudiced to Neutral Initializations
Authors: Emanuele Francazi, Francesco Pinto, Aurelien Lucchi, Marco Baity-Jesi
Abstract: Normalization layers, such as Batch Normalization and Layer Normalization, are central components in modern neural networks, widely adopted to improve training stability and generalization. While their practical effectiveness is well documented, a detailed theoretical understanding of how normalization affects model behavior, starting from initialization, remains an important open question. In this work, we investigate how both the presence and placement of normalization within hidden layers influence the statistical properties of network predictions before training begins. In particular, we study how these choices shape the distribution of class predictions at initialization, which can range from unbiased (Neutral) to highly concentrated (Prejudiced) toward a subset of classes. Our analysis shows that normalization placement induces systematic differences in the initial prediction behavior of neural networks, which in turn shape the dynamics of learning. By linking architectural choices to prediction statistics at initialization, our work provides a principled understanding of how normalization can influence early training behavior and offers guidance for more controlled and interpretable network design.

Title: Hong-Ou-Mandel interferometry with trapped polariton condensates
Authors: S. Baryshev, I. Smirnov, I. Gnusov, T. Cookson, A. Zasedatelev, S. Kilin, P. G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: We investigate the indistinguishability of polaritons in optically trapped Bose Einstein condensates by implementing Hong-Ou-Mandel (HOM) interferometry and test the limitations of two-polariton interference in the coherent, limit-cycle and thermal statistical regimes. We observe that the HOM dynamics of a circularly polarized condensate follows the condensate coherence time with the characteristic HOM-dip approaching the classical limit. Linearly polarized condensates exhibit a combined effect of polariton bunching and two-polariton interference. Under elliptically polarized excitation, the temporal evolution of the spinor condensate results in the revival of the HOM-dip at the spinor Larmor precession frequency.

Title: Universality of noise-induced transitions in nonlinear voter models
Authors: Jaume Llabrés, Maxi San Miguel, Raúl Toral
Abstract: We analyze the universality classes of phase transitions in a variety of nonlinear voter models. By mapping several models with symmetric absorbing states onto a canonical model introduced in previous studies, we confirm that they exhibit a Generalized Voter (GV) transition. We then propose a canonical mean-field model that extends the original formulation by incorporating a noise term that eliminates the absorbing states. This generalization gives rise to a phase diagram featuring two distinct types of phase transitions: a continuous Ising transition and a discontinuous transition we call Modified Generalized Voter (MGV). These two transition lines converge at a tricritical point. We map diverse noisy nonlinear voter models onto this extended canonical form. Using finite-size scaling techniques above and below the upper critical dimension, we show that the continuous transition of these models belongs to the Ising universality class in their respective dimensionality. We also find universal behavior at the tricitical point. Our results provide a unifying framework for classifying phase transitions in stochastic models of opinion dynamics with both nonlinearity and noise.

Title: TensorMixedStates: a Julia library for simulating pure and mixed quantum states using matrix product states
Authors: Jérôme Houdayer, Grégoire Misguich
Abstract: We introduce TensorMixedStates, a Julia library built on top of ITensor which allows the simulation of quantum systems in presence of dissipation using matrix product states (MPS). It offers three key features: i) it implements the MPS representation for mixed states along with associated operations, in particular the time evolution according to a Lindblad equation or discrete time evolution using non-unitary gates (quantum channels), ii) it is based on ITensor, which has proven its effectiveness and which gives access to efficient low-level tensor manipulation as well state-of-the-art algorithms (like DMRG, TDVP, quantum numbers conservation and automated parallelization), finally iii) it presents a user-friendly interface allowing writing sophisticated simulations for pure and mixed quantum states in a few lines of code.

Title: Is Grokking a Computational Glass Relaxation?
Authors: Xiaotian Zhang, Yue Shang, Entao Yang, Ge Zhang
Abstract: Understanding neural network's (NN) generalizability remains a central question in deep learning research. The special phenomenon of grokking, where NNs abruptly generalize long after the training performance reaches a near-perfect level, offers a unique window to investigate the underlying mechanisms of NNs' generalizability. Here we propose an interpretation for grokking by framing it as a computational glass relaxation: viewing NNs as a physical system where parameters are the degrees of freedom and train loss is the system energy, we find memorization process resembles a rapid cooling of liquid into non-equilibrium glassy state at low temperature and the later generalization is like a slow relaxation towards a more stable configuration. This mapping enables us to sample NNs' Boltzmann entropy (states of density) landscape as a function of training loss and test accuracy. Our experiments in transformers on arithmetic tasks suggests that there is NO entropy barrier in the memorization-to-generalization transition of grokking, challenging previous theory that defines grokking as a first-order phase transition. We identify a high-entropy advantage under grokking, an extension of prior work linking entropy to generalizability but much more significant. Inspired by grokking's far-from-equilibrium nature, we develop a toy optimizer WanD based on Wang-landau molecular dynamics, which can eliminate grokking without any constraints and find high-norm generalizing solutions. This provides strictly-defined counterexamples to theory attributing grokking solely to weight norm evolution towards the Goldilocks zone and also suggests new potential ways for optimizer design.

Title: Coherent Spectroscopic Probes of Topology: A Velocity-Gauge Perspective
Authors: Eric R Bittner, Carlos Silva-Acuna
Abstract: We present a velocity-gauge formalism for computing nonlinear current response functions in periodic systems and apply it to the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model as a minimal topological testbed. By retaining the full minimal coupling Hamiltonian and avoiding the rotating wave approximation, we construct gauge-consistent expressions for the linear and third-order current susceptibilities using retarded Green's functions. Our results reveal how nonlinear optical spectra encode not only energy-level transitions but also interband phase coherence and topological winding. In the topological phase, the third-order response exhibits characteristic phase inversions and spectral asymmetries that are absent in the trivial phase. These features reflect geometric changes in the Bloch eigenstates and highlight the role of virtual pathways in shaping the nonlinear signal. Our framework offers a robust and extensible platform for modeling nonlinear light-matter interactions in topological materials beyond the dipole approximation and the standard Coulomb-gauge formulation in molecular spectroscopy.

Title: A comprehensive exploration of interaction networks reveals a connection between entanglement and network structure
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Yuki Kawaguchi
Abstract: Quantum many-body systems are typically studied assuming translational symmetry in the interaction network. Recent experimental advances in various platforms for quantum simulators have enabled the realization of irregular interaction networks, which are intractable to implement with conventional crystal lattices. Another hallmark of these advances is the ability to observe the time-dependent behaviour of quantum many-body systems. However, the relationship between irregular interaction networks and quantum many-body dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate the connection between the structure of the interaction network and the eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model by exploring all possible interaction networks up to seven spins. We find that the eigenstate entanglement depends on the structure of the Hilbert space diagram, particularly the structure of the equienergy subgraph. We further reveal a correlation linking the structure of the Hilbert space diagram to the number of unconstrained spin pairs. Our results demonstrate that the minimum eigenstate entanglement of the quantum Ising model is governed by the specific structure of the interaction network. We anticipate that our findings provide a starting point for exploring quantum many-body systems with arbitrary interactions and finite system size. Moreover, our approach may be applicable to other quantum many-body systems, such as the Hubbard model.

Title: Exactly solvable dissipative dynamics and one-form strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking in interacting two-dimensional spin systems
Authors: Lucas Sá, Benjamin Béri
Abstract: We study the dissipative dynamics of a class of interacting "gamma-matrix" spin models coupled to a Markovian environment. For spins on an arbitrary graph, we construct a Lindbladian that maps to a non-Hermitian model of free Majorana fermions hopping on the graph with a background classical $\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge field. We show, analytically and numerically, that the steady states and relaxation dynamics are qualitatively independent of the choice of the underlying graph, in stark contrast to the Hamiltonian case. We also show that the exponentially many steady states provide a concrete example of mixed-state topological order, in the sense of strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking of a one-form symmetry. While encoding only classical information, the steady states still exhibit long-range quantum correlations. Afterward, we examine the relaxation processes toward the steady state by numerically computing decay rates, which we generically find to be finite, even in the dissipationless limit. We however identify symmetry sectors where fermion-parity conservation is enhanced to fermion-number conservation, where we can analytically bound the decay rates and prove that they vanish in the limits of both infinitely weak and infinitely strong dissipation. Finally, we show that while the choice of coherent dynamics is very flexible, exact solvability strongly constrains the allowed form of dissipation. Our work establishes an analytically tractable framework to explore nonequilibrium quantum phases of matter and the relaxation mechanisms toward them.

Title: Charge-loop current order and Z3 nematicity mediated by bond-order fluctuations in kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=Cs,Rb,K)
Authors: Rina Tazai, Youichi Yamakawa, Hiroshi Kontani
Abstract: Recent experiments on geometrically frustrated kagome metal AV3Sb5 (A=K, Rb, Cs) have revealed the emergence of the charge loop current (cLC) order near the bond order (BO) phase. However, the origin of the cLC and its relation to other phases have been uncovered. Here, we discover a novel mechanism of the cLC state, by focusing on the BO phase common in kagome metals. The BO fluctuations in metals mediate the odd-parity particle-hole condensation, which drives the topological charge-current. This state is further stabilized by the finite electron-phonon coupling and the off-site Coulomb interaction. Furthermore, it is worth noting that the predicted cLC+BO phase gives rise to the Z3-nematic state in addition to the giant anomalous Hall effect. The present theory predicts the close relationship between the cLC, the BO, and the nematicity, which is significant to understand the cascade of quantum electron states in kagome metals.

Title: Coexistence of Dirac Fermions and Magnons in a Layered Two-Dimensional Semiquinoid Metal-Organic Framework
Authors: Christopher Lane, Yixuan Huang, Lin Hou, Jian-Xin Zhu
Abstract: We predict the magnetic and electronic properties of a novel metal-organic framework. By combining density functional theory and density matrix renormalization group approaches, we find the diatomic Kagome crystal structure of the metal-semiquinoid framework (H$_2$NMe$_2$)$_2$M$_2$(Cl$_2$dhbq)$_3$ (M = Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, and Zn) to host a rich variety of antiferromagnetic (AFM) and ferromagnetic (FM) Dirac semimetallic, spin-polarized and unpolarized Dirac fermions, along with metallic phases and flat band magnetic insulators. Concomitantly, the spin excitation spectrum of the various magnetic systems display multiple Dirac-like and nodal-ring crossings. This suggests that the metal-semiquinoid system is an ideal platform for examining the intertwining of Dirac fermions and magnons.

Title: Kibble-Zurek dynamics in the anisotropic Ising model of the Si(001) surface
Authors: Gernot Schaller, Friedemann Queisser, Seyedeh Parya Katoorani, Christian Brand, Christian Kohlfürst, Mark R. Freeman, Alfred Hucht, Peter Kratzer, Björn Sothmann, Michael Horn-von Hoegen, Ralf Schützhold
Abstract: As a simplified description of the non-equilibrium dynamics of buckled dimers on the Si(001) surface, we consider the anisotropic 2D Ising model and study the freezing of spatial correlations during a cooling quench across the critical point. Depending on the cooling rate, we observe a crossover from 1D to 2D behavior. For rapid cooling, we find effectively 1D behavior in the strongly coupled direction, for which we provide an exact analytic solution of the non-equilibrium dynamics. For slower cooling rates, we start to see 2D behavior where our numerical simulations show an approach to the usual Kibble-Zurek scaling in 2D.

Title: Fermionized dual vortex theory for magnetized kagomé spin liquid
Authors: Si-Yu Pan, Gang V. Chen
Abstract: Inspired by the recent quantum oscillation measurement on the kagomé lattice antiferromagnet in finite magnetic fields, we raise the question about the physical contents of the emergent fermions and the gauge fields if the U(1) spin liquid is relevant for the finite-field kagomé lattice antiferromagnet. Clearly, the magnetic field is non-perturbative in this regime, and the finite-field state has no direct relation with the U(1) Dirac spin liquid proposal at zero field. We here consider the fermionized dual vortex liquid state as one possible candidate theory to understand the magnetized kagomé spin liquid. Within the dual vortex theory, the $S^z$ magnetization is the emergent U(1) gauge flux, and the fermionized dual vortex is the emergent fermion. The magnetic field polarizes the spin component that modulates the U(1) gauge flux for the fermionized vortices and generates the quantum oscillation. Within the mean-field theory, we discuss the gauge field correlation, the vortex-antivortex continuum and the vortex thermal Hall effect.

Abstract: Exchange-coupled interfaces are pivotal in exploiting two-dimensional (2D) ferromagnetism. Due to the extraordinary correlations among charge, spin, orbital and lattice degrees of freedom, layered magnetic transition metal chalcogenides (TMCs) bode well for exotic topological phenomena. Here we report the realization of wafer-scale Cr2Te3 down to monolayer (ML) on insulating SrTiO3(111) and/or Al2O3(001) substrates using molecular beam epitaxy. Robust ferromagnetism persists in the 2D limit. In particular, the Curie temperature TC of 2 ML Cr2Te3 increases from 100 K to ~ 120 K when proximitized to topological insulator (TI) (Bi,Sb)2Te3, with substantially boosted magnetization as observed via polarized neutron reflectometry. Our experiments and theory strongly indicate that the Bloembergen-Rowland interaction is likely universal underlying TC enhancement in TI-coupled magnetic heterostructures. The topological-surface-enhanced magnetism in 2D TMC enables further exchange coupling physics and quantum hybrid studies, including paving the way to realize interface-modulated topological electronics.

Title: Quantum colored strings in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model
Authors: Jia-Long Wang, Shi-Jie Hu, Xue-Feng Zhang
Abstract: The stripe phase, an intertwined order observed in high-temperature superconductors, is regarded as playing a key role in elucidating the underlying mechanism of superconductivity, especially in cuprates. Following Jan Zaanen's early scenario, the filled charge stripe, with one hole per unit cell of the charge order, can be taken as the interactive elastic quantum strings of holes, stabilized by $\pi$-phase shifts between neighboring magnetic domains. However, this scenario is challenging to explain, particularly in terms of electron pairing, which necessitates hole pairs. In this work, we propose a new effective model for describing the stripe phase in the hole-doped $t$-$J_z$ model. With respect to the antiferromagnetic background, the model comprises three types of color-labeled point-defects coupling to an effective spin field, so named as ``colored string". Comparing with numerical results from large-scale density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we find semi-quantitative agreement in local hole density, magnetic moment, and the newly proposed spectrum features of the effective spin field. By systematically analyzing the hole-density distribution and the scaling of groundstate energy at different system sizes, we determine the effective core radius and the effective hopping amplitude of the quantum string. Furthermore, the local pinning field can be finely adjusted to drag the quantum string, offering a potential method for detecting it in optical lattices. At last, we further demonstrate the partially-filled stripe with less than one hole per unit cell of the charge order can also be well described by the effective theory.

Title: Unconventional early-time relaxation in the Rydberg chain
Authors: Martin Schnee, Roya Radgohar, Stefanos Kourtis
Abstract: We show that unconventional relaxation dynamics of special initial states in one-dimensional arrays of Rydberg atoms produce non-generic decay of the initial-state survival probability (SP) at very early times. Using the PXP hamiltonian as a minimal model of the Rydberg blockade, we prove that the early-time SP for states exhibiting quantum many-body scarring (QMBS) decays at a characteristic rate, whose finite-size scaling is determined solely by scars. We numerically investigate the effects of both revival-enhancing and ergodicity-restoring deformations of the PXP hamiltonian and find results consistent with the limiting cases of integrable and ergodic dynamics, respectively. We moreover argue that such unconventional early relaxation of scarred initial states is characteristic of a whole class of QMBS models. Since the SP can be easily measured experimentally, our findings enable us to probe the presence of scars at time scales much shorter than that of thermalization.

Title: Classical spin liquid state in the emergent honeycomb-lattice material TbBO3
Authors: J. Khatua, D. Tay, T. Shiroka, M. Pregelj, U. Jena, M. Barik, K. Kargeti, S. K. Panda, G. B. G. Stenning, P. Manuel, M. D. Le, D. T. Adroja, P. Khuntia
Abstract: The classical spin liquid state, owing to spin frustration between classical Ising spins on triangular motifs and interplay between competing degrees of freedom, is characterized by a macroscopically degenerate ground state and topological excitations linked to emergent gauge theories. Here, by using thermodynamic and local-probe measurements down to 16 mK, we demonstrate the exotic magnetism and spin dynamics in the nearly perfect honeycomb lattice material TbBO3. The latter embodies a frustrated lattice with a superimposed triangular lattice, constituted by additional Tb3+ ions at the center of each hexagon. Thermodynamic experiments reveal the presence of dominant antiferromagnetic exchange and significant dipolar interactions. Despite sizable antiferromagnetic exchange interactions between the Tb3+ moments, muon-spin relaxation does not detect any signatures of long-range magnetic order or spin freezing down to 16 mK, corroborating the specific heat and ac susceptibility down to 45 mK. This suggests that the spin-orbit driven anisotropic exchange interaction engenders a strong frustration, crucial to induce a persistent spin dynamics. The scaling of muon relaxation rate as a function of the characteristic energy scale for several spin-liquid candidates, including TbBO3, demonstrates that a common underlying mechanism is at play. This is consistent with the NMR results on TbBO3 and reminiscent of a universal spin-liquid behavior, here attributed to dominant antiferromagnetic short-range spin correlations, confirmed by the presence of a broad magnetic diffuse scattering in the elastic and low-energy inelastic neutron scattering at Q=1.03 Ang^-1 at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that TbBO3 hosts a classical spin liquid induced by spin-orbit driven anisotropy on a frustrated honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet.

Title: Large anomalous Hall conductivity in Weyl ferrimagnet Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ predicted by density-functional calculations
Authors: Gang Bahadur Acharya, Manuel Richter, Klaus Koepernik, Madhav Prasad Ghimire
Abstract: The identification of topological Weyl semimetals has recently gained considerable attention. Here, we report the results of density-functional theory calculations regarding the magnetic properties, the electronic structure, and the intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity of the title compound, which was synthesized already 50 years ago but received little attention, hitherto. We found Cs$_{2}$Co$_{3}$S$_4$ to be a ferrimagnetic half-metal with a total spin magnetic moment of about 3 $\mu_B$ per formula unit. It shows energy band gap of 0.36 eV in the majority-spin channel and a pseudo-gap at the Fermi level in the minority-spin channel. We identified several sets of low-energy Weyl points and traced their dependence on the direction of magnetization. The intrinsic anomalous Hall conductivity is predicted to reach a magnitude up to 500 $\Omega^{-1}$cm$^{-1}$, which is comparable to values obtained in other celebrated Weyl semimetals.

Title: Abnormal planar Hall effect and disentanglement of incoherent and coherent transport in a Kondo lattice
Authors: Shuo Zou, Hai Zeng, Zhuo Wang, Guohao Dong, Xiaodong Guo, Fangjun Lu, Zengwei Zhu, Youguo Shi, Yifeng Yang, Yongkang Luo
Abstract: The nature of localized-itinerant transition in Kondo lattice systems remains a mystery despite intensive investigations in past decades. While it is often identified from the coherent peak in magnetic resistivity, recent angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and ultrafast optical spectroscopy revealed a precursor incoherent region with band bending and hybridization fluctuations. This raises the question of how the coherent heavy-electron state is developed from an incoherent background of fluctuating localized moments and then established at sufficiently low temperatures. Here, on the example of the quasi-one-dimensional Kondo lattice compound CeCo$_2$Ga$_8$, we show that planar Hall effect and planar anisotropic magnetoresistance measurements provide an effective way to disentangle the incoherent Kondo scattering contribution and the coherent heavy-electron contribution, and a multi-stage process is directly visualized with lowering temperature by their distinct angle-dependent patterns in magneto-transport. Our idea may be extended to other measurements and thereby opens up a pathway for systematically investigating the fundamental physics of Kondo lattice coherence.

Title: Slip-dominated structural transitions
Authors: Kanka Ghosh, Oguz Umut Salman, Sylvain Queyreau, Lev Truskinovsky
Abstract: We use molecular dynamics to show that plastic slip is a crucial component of the transformation mechanism of a square-to-triangular structural transition. The latter is a stylized analog of many other reconstructive phase transitions. To justify our conclusions we use a novel atomistically-informed mesoscopic representation of the field of lattice distortions in molecular dynamics simulations. Our approach reveals a hidden alternating slip distribution behind the seemingly homogeneous product phase which points to the fact that lattice invariant shears play a central role in this class of phase transformations. While the underlying pattern of anti-parallel displacements may be also interpreted as microscopic shuffling, its precise crystallographic nature strongly suggests the plasticity-centered interpretation.

Title: Probing phase transition and underlying symmetry breaking via entanglement entropy scanning
Authors: Zhe Wang, Zehui Deng, Zenan Liu, Zhiyan Wang, Yi-Ming Ding, Long Zhang, Wenan Guo, Zheng Yan
Abstract: Entanglement takes a key role in quantum physics while how much information it can extract from many-body systems is still an open question, particularly for quantum criticalities and emergent symmetries. In this work, we systematically study the entanglement entropy (EE) and its derivative (DEE) near quantum phase transitions in various quantum many-body systems. An exact one-parameter scaling relation between the DEE and system size at the critical point has been derived for the first time, which successfully obtains the critical exponent via data collapse. What's more, we find that the EE peaks at the (emergent) symmetry-enhanced first-order transition which reflects higher symmetry breaking. This work provides a new paradigm for quantum many-body research from the perspective of EE and DEE.

Title: Normalized topological indices discriminate between architectures of branched macromolecules
Authors: Domen Vaupotič, Jules Morand, Luca Tubiana, Anže Božič
Abstract: Branching architecture characterizes numerous systems, ranging from synthetic (hyper)branched polymers and biomolecules such as lignin, amylopectin, and nucleic acids to tracheal and neuronal networks. Its ubiquity reflects the many favourable properties that arise because of it. For instance, branched macromolecules are spatially compact and have a high surface functionality, which impacts their phase characteristics and self-assembly behaviour, among others. The relationship between branching and physical properties has been studied by mapping macromolecules to mathematical trees whose architecture can be characterized using topological indices. These indices, however, do not allow for a comparison of macromolecules that map to trees of different size, be it due to different mapping procedures or differences in their molecular weight. To alleviate this, we introduce a novel normalization of topological indices using estimates of their probability density functions. We determine two optimal normalized topological indices and construct a phase space that enables a robust discrimination between different architectures of branched macromolecules. We demonstrate the necessity of such a phase space on two practical applications, one being ribonucleic acid (RNA) molecules with various branching topologies and the other different methods of coarse-graining branched macromolecules. Our approach can be applied to any type of branched molecules and extended as needed to other topological indices, making it useful across a wide range of fields where branched molecules play an important role, including polymer physics, green chemistry, bioengineering, biotechnology, and medicine.

Title: A quantitative model for the Frank-Read dislocation source based on pinned mean curvature flow
Authors: Thomas Hudson, Filip Rindler, Joshua Rydell
Abstract: This work introduces a simple quantitative model for the Frank--Read source, considered to be one of the most important micro-mechanical mechanisms of dislocation creation in crystalline materials. It has long been known that these sources create dislocations in a repetitive, oscillatory process, which is driven by an external shear force. Unlike the existing explanations in the literature, the model introduced in the present article is based on just a few simple physical principles, namely line tension and dislocation motion due to a single slip plane flow rule, together with a pinning constraint on the ends of the central dislocation line. A complete discretisation, including suitable re-meshing and ``topological cutting'' algorithms, is described and simulation results are discussed. Despite its conceptual simplicity, the model and discretisation described in the present work yield remarkably accurate predictions about the shape and properties of the Frank--Read source. In particular, it is shown that only one dimensionless parameter controls the dynamics of the Frank--Read source if one neglects crystal anisotropy. This allows to derive an emergent law about the length of dislocation line generated per shear energy.

Title: Field-induced spin liquid in the decorated square-kagome antiferromagnet nabokoite KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl
Authors: Matías G. Gonzalez, Yasir Iqbal, Johannes Reuther, Harald O. Jeschke
Abstract: Quantum antiferromagnets based on the square-kagome lattice are proving to be a fertile platform for realizing nontrivial phenomena in frustrated magnetism. Recently, several decorated square-kagome compounds of the nabokoite family have been synthesized, allowing for experimental exploration of model Hamiltonians. Here, we carry out a theoretical analysis of KCu$_7$TeO$_4$(SO$_4$)$_5$Cl nabokoite using a Heisenberg Hamiltonian derived from density functional theory energy mapping. We employ classical Monte Carlo simulations to explain the two transitions experimentally observed in the low-temperature magnetization curve. Interestingly, the intermediate-field phase is also found in a purely two-dimensional model and is described by a spin liquid featuring subextensive degeneracy with a ferrimagnetic component. We show that this phase can be approximated by a checkerboard lattice in a magnetic field. Finally, we assess the effects of quantum fluctuations in zero fields using the pseudo-Majorana functional renormalization group method.

Title: Fractionalized Altermagnets: from neighboring and altermagnetic spin-liquids to spin-symmetric band splitting
Authors: João Augusto Sobral, Subrata Mandal, Mathias S. Scheurer
Abstract: We study quantum-fluctuation-driven fractionalized phases in the vicinity of altermagnetic order. First, the long-range magnetic orders in the vicinity of collinear altermagnetism are identified; these feature a non-coplanar "orbital altermagnet" which has altermagnetic symmetries in spin-rotation invariant observables. We then describe neighboring fractionalized phases with topological order reached when quantum fluctuations destroy long-range spin order, within Schwinger-boson theory and an SU(2) gauge theory of fluctuating magnetism. Discrete symmetries remain broken in some of the fractionalized phases, with the orbital altermagnet becoming an "altermagnetic spin liquid". We compute the electronic spectral function in the doped system, which is characterized by split Fermi surfaces with preserved spin-rotation symmetry.

Title: Defect liquids in a weakly imbalanced bilayer Wigner Crystal
Authors: Zekun Zhuang, Ilya Esterlis
Abstract: In a density-imbalanced bilayer Wigner crystal, where the ratio of electron densities in separate layers deviates slightly from unity, defects spontaneously form in one or both layers in the ground state of the system. Due to quantum tunneling, these defects become mobile and the system becomes a defect liquid. Motivated by this idea, we numerically study the semiclassical energetics of individual and paired point defects in the bilayer Wigner crystal system. We use these results in combination with a simple defect model to map the phase diagram of the defect liquid as a function of electron density and interlayer distance. Our results should be relevant for present experimental bilayer Wigner crystal systems.

Title: Non-monotonic radiative heat transfer in the transition from far field to near field
Authors: Victor Guillemot, Riccardo Messina, Valentina Krachmalnicoff, Rémi Carminati, Philippe Ben-Abdallah, Wilfrid Poirier, Yannick De Wilde
Abstract: We present high precision measurements of the radiative heat transfer of a glass microsphere immersed in a thermal bath in vacuum facing three different planar substrates (SiO2, SiC and Au), which exhibit very different optical behaviors in the infrared region. Using a thermoresistive probe on a cantilever, we show the nonmonotonic behavior of the radiative flux between the microsphere and its environment when the microsphere is brought closer to the substrate in the far-field to near-field transition regime. We demonstrate that this unexpected behavior is related to the singularities of dressed emission mechanisms in this three-body system sphere-substrate-bath with respect to the separation distance.

Title: The large $|U|$ expansion for a half-filled asymmetric Hubbard model on a triangular ladder in the presence of spin-dependent magnetic flux
Authors: Shota Garuchava, Bachana Beradze, Tatia Sharia, George I. Japaridze
Abstract: We consider a half-filled system of spin-1/2 fermions on a triangular ladder with spin-dependent hopping in the presence of spin-dependent flux. Using the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we derive an effective spin Hamiltonian describing the infrared properties of the system in the limit of strong on-site repulsion. The expansion is performed up to the third order in the hopping amplitude over on-site interaction energy. It is shown that the low-energy spin excitations are described by an anisotropic $XXZ$ Heisenberg model with Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction and an unconventional three-spin (correlated exchange) term in the presence of an extended magnetic field. The latter couples not only to $z$-projection of the total spin on a triangular plaquette but also to the product of $z$-components of three spins located on vertices of the triangle. In the case of strong attractive interaction, the corresponding effective model is derived from the repulsive one using the one-spin-component particle-hole transformation. The effective Hamiltonian is given by the same $XXZ$ Heisenberg model, as in the repulsive case, but in terms of pseudospin (charge) operators.

Title: Connecting Shear Thinning and Dynamic Heterogeneity in Supercooled Liquids by Localized Elasticity
Authors: Ke-Qi Zeng, Dong-Xu Yu, Zhe Wang
Abstract: Supercooled liquids exhibit complicated dynamical behaviors: At the microscopic level, the dynamics is heterogeneous spatially, known as dynamic heterogeneity. At the macroscopic level, the shear viscosity $\eta$ decreases as shear rate $\dot{\gamma}$ increases with a power law $\eta\sim\dot{\gamma}^{-\lambda}$, known as shear thinning. The relation between these two universal dynamical phenomena remains elusive. With simulations of several model liquids in two and three dimensions, we show that they are quantitatively bridged by localized elasticity embodied as transient clusters that elastically respond to shear. Prominent dynamic heterogeneity emerges right after the massive yielding of these clusters, which is initiated by shear transformation zones and facilitated by elasticity-mediated interaction. With this picture, a scaling law relating shear thinning to the characteristic length of dynamic heterogeneity is found.

Title: Gauge-invariant electromagnetic responses in superconductors
Authors: Sena Watanabe, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: Gauge invariance is essential for making physically meaningful predictions. In superconductors, mean-field Hamiltonians that explicitly break $U(1)$ symmetry often yield gauge-dependent results. While this issue has been resolved for linear responses in conventional superconductors, a unified framework that also covers unconventional superconductors and nonlinear responses has yet to be established. In this study, we present a comprehensive theoretical framework that enables gauge-invariant calculations of electromagnetic responses at arbitrary orders in external fields, applicable to both conventional and unconventional superconductors. Our construction generalizes the consistent-fluctuation-of-the-order-parameter (CFOP) approach to full photon vertices and admits a diagrammatic representation of the response kernel in terms of Feynman diagrams.

Title: Fluctuation-dissipation and virtual processes in interacting phonon systems
Authors: Aloïs Castellano, J. P. Alvarinhas Batista, Matthieu J. Verstraete
Abstract: Phonon-phonon interactions are fundamental to understanding a wide range of material properties, including thermal transport and vibrational spectra. In conventional perturbative approaches, energy conservation during each microscopic phonon interaction is enforced using delta functions. We demonstrate that these delta functions stem from an incomplete treatment, that violates the fluctuation-dissipation theorem governing systems at equilibrium. By replacing delta functions with convolutions and introducing a self-consistency condition for the phonon spectral function, we provide a more accurate and physically consistent framework. For systems where phonon dynamics can be approximated as Markovian, we simplify this approach, reducing the dissipative component to a single parameter tied to phonon lifetimes. Applying this method to boron arsenide, we find that self-consistent linewidths better capture the phonon scattering processes, significantly improving agreement with experimental thermal conductivity values. These results also challenge the conventional view of four-phonon processes as dominant in BAs, demonstrating the adequacy of a three-phonon description, provided it is self-consistent. With this method we address critical limitations of perturbative approaches, offering new insights into dissipation and phonon-mediated processes, and enabling more accurate modeling of anharmonic materials.

Title: Enhanced magnetoelastic stress in disordered iron-gallium alloy thin films revealed by direct measurement
Authors: Adrián Begué, Maria Grazia Proietti, José Ignacio Arnaudas, Miguel Ciria
Abstract: The large magnetostriction in FeGa alloys is relevant for manifold applications, but for thin films, it can play a prominent role in controlling the strength of the magnetic anisotropy. Bulk samples show values depending on the extensive preparation procedure compendium, which is limited in its temperature range for high-quality thin-film synthesis. Here, we present a study of the magnetoelastic coupling coefficients $B_1$ and $B_2$ in epitaxial FeGa thin films below 50 nm deposited on the MgO(001) surface at 150 $^\circ$C by the cantilever method. Series of films with 22, 28, and 33 at. % Ga do not show thickness-dependent variations for $B_1$ and $B_2$, but $-B_1$ for the 22 at. % Ga composition is 10 MPa, roughly 2 times the bulk value and smaller than the bulk-like value of $-B_1$=12.1 MPa obtained for a film with 17 at. % Ga. This enhancement is correlated with the A2 crystal structure for the film rather than the coexistence with D0$_3$ or other ordered nanometric precipitates proposed for bulk samples. Synchrotron diffraction excludes the formation of long-range L6$_0$, or D0$_3$ precipitates in samples with (001)A2 peaks at concentrations around 25 at. % Ga, which implies partial chemical disorder. The analysis of extended x-ray absorption fine structure measurements points to a D0$_3$ local order with a residual number of Ga-Ga pairs. Considering that the substrate quenches the movable strain in the A2 phase described in dual-phase structures, our results point to the important role of the electronic structure of the iron atoms modified by the presence of Ga in the alloy. This effect enlarges $B_1$ in films with the A2 phase, stabilized using epitaxial growth.

Title: Atomistic mechanisms of viscosity in 2D liquid-like fluids
Authors: Dong Huang, Shaoyu Lu, Chen Liang, Matteo Baggioli, Yan Feng
Abstract: Shear viscosity plays a fundamental role in fluid dynamics from heavy-ion collisions to biological processes. Still, its microscopic mechanisms at the individual particle kinetic level remain a subject of ongoing research, specially in dense systems. In this work, we systematically investigate the shear viscosity ($\eta$) of two-dimensional (2D) simple fluids using computer simulations of Lennard-Jones, Yukawa, and one-component plasma systems. By combining Frenkel's liquid description, consisting of solid-like quasi-harmonic vibrations interrupted by thermally activated hops, with the concept of lifetime of local atomic connectivity $\tau_{LC}$, we find a surprisingly simple formula for the kinematic viscosity that is solely determined by $\tau_{LC}$ and the average kinetic particle speed $\bar{v}_p$. The derived analytical expression provides a direct link between macroscopic and microscopic dynamics, which shows excellent agreement with the simulation data in the dense liquid-like regime in all the 2D fluids considered. Moreover, it is discovered that, $\tau_{LC}$ in 2D fluids is universally determined by the effective potential difference between the first peak and valley of the pair correlation function, implying a direct connection between macroscopic shear transport and microscopic structure. Finally, we demonstrate that the characteristic length scale $l_p= \bar{v}_p \tau_{LC}$, which governs the macroscopic shear viscosity, aligns with the elastic length-scale that defines the propagation limit of collective shear waves in liquids. These findings establish that shear viscosity in 2D fluids arises from the diffusive transport of average particle momentum across the elastic length scale. Moreover, they highlight that shear dynamics are fundamentally governed by localized configurational excitations within the atomic connectivity network.

Title: Discovery of transient topological crystalline order in optically driven SnSe

Abstract: Ultrafast optical excitation provides a powerful route for accessing emergent quantum phases far from equilibrium, enabling transient light-induced phenomena such as magnetism, ferroelectricity, and superconductivity. However, extending this approach to induce topological phases, especially in conventional semiconductors, remains challenging. Here, we report the observation of a thermally inaccessible, transient topological crystalline order in the layered semiconductor SnSe, a trivial insulator with a sizable (~ 0.8 eV) band gap, induced by femtosecond above-gap excitation. Time- and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy directly reveals the sub-picosecond emergence of Dirac-like linear dispersions within the band gap. Their features, including a high Fermi velocity (~ 2.5x10^5 m/s), multiple Dirac points away from high-symmetry momenta, and independence from probe photon energy, are consistent with mirror-symmetry-protected surface states of a topological crystalline insulator. The observed spectral dynamics, combined with density functional theory calculations, indicate that the femtosecond excitation transiently increases lattice symmetry, enabling topological crystalline order to emerge. Our discovery opens new avenues for ultrafast optical control of topological quantum phases in semiconductors, with potential applications in quantum and spintronic devices.

Title: A universal scaling of condensation temperature in quantum fluids
Authors: S.V. Dordevic
Abstract: The phenomena of superconductivity and superfluidity are believed to originate from the same underlying physics, namely the condensation of either bosons or pairs of fermions (Cooper pairs). In this work I complied and analyzed literature data for a number of quantum fluids and showed that indeed they all follow the same simple scaling law. The critical temperature for condensation T$_c$ is found to scale with the condensate coherence length $\xi$ and the effective mass of condensing particles m$^{\ast}$. The scaling plot includes members of most known classes of superconductors, as well as a number of superfluids and condensates, such as $^3$He, $^4$He, dilute Bose and Fermi gases, excitons, polaritons, neutron superfluid and proton superconductor in neutron stars, nuclear pairing, quark--antiquark condensate and Higgs condensate. The scaling plot spans more that 24 orders of magnitude of critical temperatures, albeit the scaling exponent is not the one predicted by theory. The plot might help the search for a QCD axion.

Title: Floating zone growth at high oxygen pressures in Ruddlesden-Popper bilayer nickelate Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_{7-δ}$
Authors: H. Yilmaz, P. Sosa-Lizama, M. Knauft, K. Küster, U. Starke, M. Isobe, O. Clemens, P. A. van Aken, Y. E. Suyolcu, P. Puphal
Abstract: With the discovery of superconductivity under pressure in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer La$_3$Ni$^{2.5+}_2$O$_7$ and trilayer La$_4$Ni$^{2.66+}_3$O$_{10}$, a new field of nickelate superconductors opened up. In this respect, Sr-Ni-O RP-type phases represent alternative systems that exist with partial cation substitution. We demonstrate that by Y-doping in Sr$_{3}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (SNAO), as Y$_{y}$Sr$_{3-y}$Ni$_{2-x}$Al$_{x}$O$_7$ (YSNAO), the drawback of an insulating ground state is overcome, and a significant decrease in resistivity is achieved with crystals exhibiting semiconducting behavior. We employ optical floating zone (OFZ) growth at 10 bar oxygen partial pressure to explore the phase formation in a narrow region of Y-Sr-Ni-Al-O and investigate via DFT the general stability of the pure Sr-Ni-O scenario. Using extensive diffraction and spectroscopy, as well as transport and magnetization measurements, the structural, chemical, electrical, and magnetic properties of the as-grown and reduced compounds were investigated. The optimal growth of YSNAO allows for large high quality crystals suitable for neutron studies. In the Al-free growth, a known $n=1$ RP system with Sr$_{1.66}$Y$_{0.33}$NiO$_{4-\delta}$, from which the first single crystals were obtained, was further confirmed, opening the door for future exploration of \textit{A}-site substituted RP-type phases without Ni-site disorder.

Title: Texture- and Stress-Dependent Electromechanical Response in Ferroelectric PZT: Insights from a Micromechanical Model
Authors: Saujatya Mandal, Debashish Das
Abstract: The electromechanical response of PbZr0.52Ti0.48O3 (PZT) near the morphotropic phase boundary (MPB) is strongly influenced by crystallographic texture and residual stress, both of which affect domain switching behavior. While these effects are critical for optimizing sensors, actuators, and MEMS devices, their combined influence remains poorly understood. We present a computational micromechanical model that captures texture- and stress-dependent polarization switching in MPB PZT. The framework incorporates both tetragonal and rhombohedral domain switching, along with interphase transformations, enabling accurate simulation of nonlinear electromechanical behavior. The model reproduces key experimental trends, including enhanced piezoelectric response in (001)-textured ceramics, and degradation under high in-plane stress. The implementation, provided as open-source MATLAB code, offers an accessible platform for experimentalists and materials designers to explore and interpret electromechanical behavior. By linking microstructural orientation and stress state to macroscopic response, this work provides a practical tool for understanding and designing next-generation piezoelectric materials.

Title: Low-energy perspective of interacting electrons in the normal state of superconducting bilayer nickelate
Authors: Frank Lechermann, Steffen Bötzel, Ilya M. Eremin
Abstract: Developing a low-energy model is essential for understanding unconventional superconductivity in bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$. Here, we analyze distinct low-energy scenarios of the normal state by downfolding the ab-initio determined band structure and applying the mean-field regime of rotational-invariant slave-boson theory. We compare models based on the single-site two-orbital, the two-site four-orbital and a proposed minimal cluster (MC) picture. The latter builds up on three adapted orbitals located on the sites of the basic Ni-O-Ni cluster across the bilayer. Intriguing interplay between the Hund coupling $J_{\rm H}$ and the interlayer exchange $J_{\perp}$ is encountered in the multiorbital multi-site problem. While the tendency for interlayer Ni-$d_{z^2}$ singlet formation is pronounced, a complete localization remains hindered by the coupling to the Ni-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. The correlation physics in the MC picture is peculiar with respect to the effective interorbital/site exchange.

Title: The crack pattern of indented cohesive granular media
Authors: Marie-Julie Dalbe, Pierre Jodlowski, Nicolas Vandenberghe
Abstract: Cohesive granular materials, like wet sand, retain their shape before yielding under stress. This solid-like behavior is associated with elasticity. As the loading increases, the material typically flows. However, cohesive materials can also develop cracks, similar to those observed in brittle materials. This study explores the formation of cracks during the indentation of a granular pile. A solid cylindrical indenter is pushed quasi-statically into the wet granular medium, causing radial cracks to appear. These cracks resemble mode I cracks observed in brittle solid materials. We characterize the crack pattern through direct observation and three-dimensional X-ray micro-tomography. Notably, we highlight the correlation between the dilation of the material during shearing and the appearance of cracks.

Title: Dynamics of one-dimensional spin models via complex-time evolution of tensor networks
Authors: Jeong Hyeok Cha, Hyun-Yong Lee, Heung-Sik Kim
Abstract: Studying the real-time dynamics of strongly correlated systems poses significant challenges, which have recently become more manageable thanks to advances in density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) and tensor network methods. A notable development in this area is the introduction of a complex-time evolution scheme for tensor network states, originally suggested for solving Anderson impurity model and designed to suppress the growth of entanglement under time evolution. In this study, we employ the complex-time evolution scheme to investigate the dynamics of one-dimensional spin systems, specifically the transverse-field Ising model (TFIM) and the XXZ model. Our analysis revisits the dynamic critical exponent $z$ of the TFIM and explores the dynamical structure factor in both gapped and gapless states of the XXZ model. Importantly, the complex-time evolution reproduces the results of real-time evolution while mitigating the rapid growth of quantum entanglement typically associated with the latter. These results demonstrate that the combination of complex-time evolution and extrapolation provides a robust and efficient framework for studying the dynamics of complex quantum systems, enabling more comprehensive insights into their behavior.

Title: Learning transitions in classical Ising models and deformed toric codes
Authors: Malte Pütz, Samuel J. Garratt, Hidetoshi Nishimori, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: Conditional probability distributions describe the effect of learning an initially unknown classical state through Bayesian inference. Here we demonstrate the existence of a learning transition, having signatures in the long distance behavior of conditional correlation functions, in the two-dimensional classical Ising model. This transition, which arises when learning local energy densities, extends all the way from the infinite-temperature paramagnetic state down to the thermal critical state. The intersection of the line of learning transitions and the thermal Ising transition is a novel tricritical point. Our model for learning also describes the effects of weak measurements on a family of quantum states which interpolate between the (topologically ordered) toric code and a trivial product state. Notably, the location of the above tricritical point implies that the quantum memory in the entire topological phase is robust to weak measurement, even when the initial state is arbitrarily close to the quantum phase transition separating topological and trivial phases. Our analysis uses a replica field theory combined with the renormalization group, and we chart out the phase diagram using a combination of tensor network and Monte Carlo techniques. Our methods can be extended to study the more general effects of learning on both classical and quantum states.

Title: Robust Wave Splitters Based on Scattering Singularities in Complex non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Jared Erb, Nadav Shaibe, Tsampikos Kottos, Steven M. Anlage
Abstract: Coherent perfect absorption (CPA) is well-known as a phenomenon where all the energy of a specific injected wavefront is completely absorbed by losses in a system, independent of details. This has applications in wavefront shaping, communication, filtering, wireless power transfer, etc. We have discovered an application of coherent perfect absorption enabling conditions as a tunable splitter that is robust to any change in relative amplitude or phase of an arbitrary injected waveform. We show experimentally that the fixed splitting ratios and output phases at CPA enabling conditions are robust to 100 dB of relative power and 2$\pi$ phase changes of the input waves to a complex non-Hermitian two-port system. We also demonstrate that the splitting power ratio can be tuned by multiple orders of magnitude and the CPA enabling conditions can be tuned to any desired frequency with suitable tunable perturbations embedded in the system. Although this phenomenon is realized in two-port systems, tunable robust splitting can be achieved between any two ports of multiport systems. These results are general to all wave scattering phenomena and hold in generic complex scattering systems.

Title: Coarse-grained graph architectures for all-atom force predictions
Authors: Sungwoo Kang
Abstract: We introduce a machine-learning framework termed coarse-grained all-atom force field (CGAA-FF), which incorporates coarse-grained message passing within an all-atom force field using equivariant nature of graph models. The CGAA-FF model employs grain embedding to encode atomistic coordinates into nodes representing grains rather than individual atoms, enabling predictions of both grain-level energies and atom-level forces. Tested on organic electrolytes, CGAA-FF achieves root-mean-square errors of 4.96 meV atom-1 for energy and 0.201 eV A-1 for force predictions. CGAA-FF significantly reduces computational costs, achieving about 22- and 14-fold improvements in simulation speed and memory efficiency, respectively, compared to the all-atom potential (SevenNet-0). Since this CGAA framework can be integrated into any equivariant architecture, we believe this work opens the door to efficient all-atom simulations of soft-matter systems.

Title: General Hamiltonian description of nonreciprocal interactions
Authors: Yu-Bo Shi, Roderich Moessner, Ricard Alert, Marin Bukov
Abstract: In a vast class of systems, which includes members as diverse as active colloids and bird flocks, interactions do not stem from a potential, and are in general nonreciprocal. Thus, it is not possible to define a conventional energy function, nor to use analytical or numerical tools that rely on it. Here, we overcome these limitations by constructing a Hamiltonian that includes auxiliary degrees of freedom; when subject to a constraint, this Hamiltonian yields the original non-reciprocal dynamics. We show that Glauber dynamics based on the constrained Hamiltonian reproduces the steady states of the original Langevin dynamics, as we explicitly illustrate for dissipative XY spins with vision-cone interactions. Further, the symplectic structure inherent to our construction allows us to apply the well-developed notions of Hamiltonian engineering, which we demonstrate by varying the amplitude of a periodic drive to tune the spin interactions between those of a square and a chain lattice geometry. Overall, our framework for generic nonreciprocal pairwise interactions paves the way for bringing to bear the full conceptual and methodological power of conventional statistical mechanics and Hamiltonian dynamics to nonreciprocal systems.

Title: Dominant orbital magnetization in the prototypical altermagnet MnTe
Authors: Chao Chen Ye, Karma Tenzin, Jagoda Sławińska, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: Altermagnetism is an unconventional form of antiferromagnetism characterized by momentum-dependent spin polarization of electronic states and zero net magnetization, arising from specific crystalline symmetries. In the presence of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and broken time-reversal symmetry, altermagnets can exhibit finite net magnetization and anomalous Hall effect (AHE), phenomena typically associated with ferromagnets. Due to the dependence of AHE on magnetization, understanding the interplay between spin and orbital contributions to magnetization is essential for interpreting experiments and designing altermagnetic devices. In this work, we use density functional theory to investigate the intrinsic spin and orbital magnetization of the magnetic ground state of the prototypical altermagnet {\alpha}-MnTe. We find that SOC induces weak ferromagnetism through spin canting, accompanied by a slight in-plane rotation of the Néel vector. Notably, we identify a significant net orbital magnetization of 0.176 {\mu}B per unit cell oriented along the z-axis, while the spin magnetization in the same direction is much smaller at 0.002 {\mu}B. By varying the chemical potential, we show that the spin magnetization is tunable through hole doping, whereas the orbital magnetization remains robust against carrier density changes. These results highlight the important role of orbital magnetization and establish its relevance for orbital-based phenomena in altermagnets.

Title: Coexistence of Rashba and Dirac dispersions on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulator decorated with transition metals
Authors: Giuseppe Cuono, Rajibul Islam, Amar Fakhredine, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: The Dirac cone originates from the bulk topology, yet its primary contribution comes from the surface since spatially, the Dirac state emerges at the boundary between the trivial and topological phases. At the same time, the Rashba states emerge in regions where inversion symmetry is broken. On the surface of the centrosymmetric topological insulators, both Rashba and Dirac bands are present and their hybridization produces the giant Rashba effect, modifying both Rashba's and Dirac's bands. Therefore, pure Rashba and Dirac fermions are inherently incompatible on the surface of centrosymmetric topological insulators if the material is homogeneous. Inspired by recent experiments, we focused on the (111) polar surface of PbSe, which becomes a topological crystalline insulator under compressive strain, and we established the conditions under which a topological system can simultaneously host pure Rashba and Dirac surface states close to the Fermi level. The coexistence of pure Dirac and Rashba dispersions is only possible in a non-homogeneous centrosymmetric topological insulator, where the spatial origins of the two bands are effectively separated. In the experimentally observed case of PbSe, we demonstrate that a metallic overlayer induces a strong electrostatic potential gradient in the subsurface region, which in turn generates the electric field responsible for Rashba splitting in the subsurface layers. Consequently, in PbSe(111), the Rashba states arise from subsurface layers, while the Dirac states live mainly on the surface layers. Finally, we compare the properties of the Rashba in the trivial and topological phases; the calculated Rashba coefficient agrees qualitatively with the experimental results.

Title: Unconventional superconductivity of an altermagnetic metal: Polarized BCS and inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov states
Authors: Hui Hu, Zhao Liu, Xia-Ji Liu
Abstract: We investigate the superconductivity of two-dimensional spin-1/2 Fermi systems with $d$-wave altermagnetism under external magnetic field near zero temperature. At large altermagnetic coupling without magnetic field, we show that altermagnetism drives a second-order phase transition from the standard Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer (BCS) state to an inhomogeneous Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) state. The inclusion of magnetic field turns the BCS state into a long-sought polarized BCS superconductor with spin-population imbalance. It also shrinks the parameter window of the FFLO state and eventually leads to a nontrivial quantum tri-critical Lifshitz point, where two second-order phase transition lines between the polarized BCS, FFLO and normal states intersect. At small altermagnetic coupling, we find the usual route to the FFLO state driven by magnetic field. The presence of the altermagnetic coupling narrows the phase window of the FFLO state and creates another quantum Lifshitz point, where a first-order transition curve meets a second-order transition line. Between the two Lifshitz points, the transition from the polarized BCS state to the normal state is smooth. Our predicted rich phase diagram is relevant to some recently discovered unconventional magnets, including RuO$_{2}$ that exhibits a relatively high superconducting temperature in the thin film limit under applied strain. Our results of unconventional superfluidity are also testable in ultracold atom laboratories, where a spin-1/2 altermagnetic Fermi gas might be realizable upon loading into two-dimensional Hubbard lattices.

Title: Quantum Lifshitz points in an altermagnetic metal
Authors: Hui Hu, Xia-Ji Liu
Abstract: We predict the existence of two tri-critical quantum Lifshitz points in recently discovered $d$-wave altermagnetic metals subjected to an external magnetic field. These points connect a spatially modulated Fulde--Ferrell--Larkin--Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, a uniform polarized Bardeen--Cooper--Schrieffer (BCS) superconducting phase, and the normal metallic phase in a nontrivial manner. Depending on whether the FFLO state is primarily induced by the magnetic field or by $d$-wave altermagnetism, we classify the corresponding Lifshitz points as field-driven or altermagnetism-driven, respectively. Notably, the two types exhibit distinct behaviors: the transition from the FFLO phase to the polarized BCS phase is first-order near the field-driven Lifshitz point, as might be expected, whereas it becomes continuous near the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point. We further explore the effects of finite temperature and find that the altermagnetism-driven Lifshitz point is significantly more sensitive to thermal fluctuations.

Title: Algebraic Compression of Free Fermionic Quantum Circuits: Particle Creation, Arbitrary Lattices and Controlled Evolution
Authors: Efekan Kökcü, Daan Camps, Lindsay Bassman Oftelie, Wibe A. de Jong, Roel Van Beeumen, A. F. Kemper
Abstract: Recently we developed a local and constructive algorithm based on Lie algebraic methods for compressing Trotterized evolution under Hamiltonians that can be mapped to free fermions. The compression algorithm yields a circuit which scales linearly in the number of qubits, has a depth independent of evolution time and compresses time-dependent Hamiltonians. The algorithm is limited to simple nearest-neighbor spin interactions and fermionic hopping. In this work, we extend our methods to compress evolution with long-range fermionic hopping, thereby enabling the embedding of arbitrary lattices onto a chain of qubits for fermion models. Moreover, we show that controlled time evolution, as well as fermion creation and annihilation operators can also be compressed. We demonstrate our results by adiabatically preparing the ground state for a half-filled fermionic chain, simulating a $4 \times 4$ tight binding model on ibmq washington, and calculating the topological Zak phase on a Quantinuum H1-1 trapped-ion quantum computer. With these new developments, our results enable the simulation of a wider range of models of interest and the efficient compression of subcircuits.

Title: Non-coherent evolution of closed weakly interacting system leads to equidistribution of probabilities of microstates
Authors: A.P. Meilakhs
Abstract: We introduce a concept of non-coherent evolution of macroscopic quantum systems. We show that for weakly interacting systems, such evolution is a Markovian stochastic process. The transition rates between system states, which characterize the process, are determined by Fermi's golden rule. Such evolution is time-irreversible and leads to the equidistribution of probabilities across every state of the system. Furthermore, we investigate the time dependence of the mean numbers of particles in single-particle states and find that, under the given assumptions, it is governed by the Boltzmann collision integral. In this theory, non-coherence is the mechanism that transforms time-reversible unitary evolution into time-irreversible stochastic evolution. Thus, we present a possible solution to the famous arrow-of-time problem.

Title: Niobium coaxial cavities with internal quality factors exceeding 1.5 billion for circuit quantum electrodynamics
Authors: Andrew E. Oriani, Fang Zhao, Tanay Roy, Alexander Anferov, Kevin He, Ankur Agrawal, Riju Banerjee, Srivatsan Chakram, David I. Schuster
Abstract: Group-V materials such as niobium and tantalum have become popular choices for extending the performance of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED) platforms allowing for quantum processors and memories with reduced error rates and more modes. The complex surface chemistry of niobium however makes identifying the main modes of decoherence difficult at millikelvin temperatures and single-photon powers. We use niobium coaxial quarter-wave cavities to study the impact of etch chemistry, prolonged atmospheric exposure, and the significance of cavity conditions prior to and during cooldown, in particular niobium hydride evolution, on single-photon coherence. We demonstrate cavities with quality factors of Q_int>1.4X10^9 in the single-photon regime, a 15 fold improvement over aluminum cavities of the same geometry. We rigorously quantify the sensitivity of our fabrication process to various loss mechanisms and demonstrate a 2-4X reduction in the two-level system (TLS) loss tangent and a 3-5X improvement in the residual resistance over traditional BCP etching techniques. Finally, we demonstrate transmon integration and coherent cavity control while maintaining a cavity coherence of 11.3ms. The accessibility of our method, which can easily be replicated in academic-lab settings, and the demonstration of its performance mark an advancement in 3D cQED.

Title: Provably Efficient Simulation of 1D Long-Range Interacting Systems at Any Temperature
Authors: Rakesh Achutha, Donghoon Kim, Yusuke Kimura, Tomotaka Kuwahara
Abstract: We introduce a method that ensures efficient computation of one-dimensional quantum systems with long-range interactions across all temperatures. Our algorithm operates within a quasi-polynomial runtime for inverse temperatures up to $\beta={\rm poly}(\ln(n))$. At the core of our approach is the Density Matrix Renormalization Group algorithm, which typically does not guarantee efficiency. We have created a new truncation scheme for the matrix product operator of the quantum Gibbs states, which allows us to control the error analytically. Additionally, our method can be applied to simulate the time evolution of systems with long-range interactions, achieving significantly better precision than that offered by the Lieb-Robinson bound.

Title: General recipe for immediate entanglement death-birth transitions via Bell states: environmental Heisenberg exchange as an example
Authors: Son-Hsien Chen, Seng Ghee Tan, Che-Chun Huang
Abstract: Environment is known to play a dual role in both extinguishing and establishing entanglement, leading to entanglement sudden death (ESD) and entanglement sudden birth (ESB). In this paper, we propose a recipe for the initial states of two qubits to undergo ESD, ESB, or transition of finite duration (TFD) between them. While this recipe is \emph{generally independent of the interaction}, a spin-star model with environmental Heisenberg exchange is chosen for illustration. Utilizing the Bell states, we introduce the entanglement switch parameter (ESP), whose sign indicates whether the qubit bipartite entanglement is switched on or off. The classical (quantum) weighting of the Bell states encodes the ESP for initial mixed (pure) states. When more than two Bell states are adopted, the ESP permits states to penetrate through the entanglement-unentanglement boundary. In this case, the penetrability of a small ESP ensures the immediate occurrence of ESD or ESB and indicates the TFD if the local time-even symmetry in the entanglement monotone is also satisfied. When no more than two Bell states are employed, the penetrability is lost, and TFD is only identified in some mixed states but not in pure states; here for pure states, the environmental quantum degrees of freedom are associated with the number of Bell states. Thanks to the simplicity of this model, analytic results are provided. We also analyze the symmetries that can convert or alter ESD into ESB, and vice versa. The recipe enhances the controllability of entanglement dynamics and facilitates entanglement engineering.

Title: Tube Category, Tensor Renormalization and Topological Holography
Authors: Tian Lan
Abstract: Ocneanu's tube algebra provides a finite algorithm to compute the Drinfeld center of a fusion category. In this work we reveal the universal property underlying the tube algebra. Take a base category $\mathcal V$ which is strongly concrete, bicomplete, and closed symmetric monoidal. For physical applications one takes $\mathcal V=\mathbf{Vect}$ the category of vector spaces. Given a $\mathcal V$-enriched rigid monoidal category $\mathcal C$ (not necessarily finite or semisimple) we define the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ using coends valued in $\mathcal V$. Our main theorem established the relation between (the category of representations of) the tube category $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ and the Drinfeld center $Z(\mathcal C)$: $Z(\mathcal C)\hookrightarrow \mathrm{Fun}(\mathbb X \mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V)\cong Z(\mathcal C\hookrightarrow\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))\hookrightarrow Z(\mathrm{Fun}(\mathcal C^{\mathrm{op}},\mathcal V))$. Physically, besides viewing the tube category as a version of TFT with domain being the tube, we emphasize the "Wick-rotated" perspective, that the morphisms in $\mathbb X \mathcal C$ are the local tensors of fixed-point matrix product operators which preserves the symmetry $\mathcal C$ in one spatial dimension. We provide a first-principle flavored construction, from microscopic quantum degrees of freedom and operators preserving the symmetry, to the macroscopic universal properties of the symmetry which form the Drinfeld center. Our work is thus a proof to the 1+1D topological holography in a very general setting.

Title: The Non-Local Dual Phase Lag Model of Heat Conduction in a Silicon Metal-Oxide-Semiconductor Field-Effect Transistor
Authors: Sharif A. Sulaiman, Zahra Shomali
Abstract: As the transistors and consequently the chips are getting smaller, the accurate investigation of heat transport at micro/nanoscale, becomes an important issue of concern. This is due to an increase in the energy consumption and the leakage currents as a result of the miniaturization which requires taking care of the thermal behavior to make sure that the device is working in the threshold temperature regime. The current work deals with a two-dimensional framework, incorporating the nonlocality in space, for more accurate investigation of the nanoscale heat transport using the lower computational cost phenomenological macroscopical Dual Phase Lag (DPL) method. The non dimensional non-locality parameter {\gamma}, which indicates the strength of the non-locality, is embedded through the modified DPL model named as nonlocal DPL. It is obtained that for the two-dimensional silicon transistor, the {\gamma} parameter in x and y direction has the same value and like its behavior at one-dimension, is linearly dependent on the Knudsen number, being 1.5 for Kn=10 and 0.015 for Kn=0.1. Also, the phase lagging ratio, B, is found to be 0.08. It should be mentioned that the non-locality effect is more pronounced for smaller systems with higher Knudsen number in which the non-Fourier behavior is more evident but contemplating the non-locality parameter in systems with lower Knudsen number, makes the results more precise. In brief, it is confirmed that taking into account the {\gamma} parameter is noteworthy for accurately predicting the thermal behavior in micro/nano scale systems using the classical macroscopical methods.

Title: Is there a conflict between causality and diamagnetism?
Authors: Niclas Westerberg, Stephen M. Barnett
Abstract: There is a long-standing apparent conflict between the existence of diamagnetism and causality as expressed through the Kramers-Kronig relations. In essence, using causality arguments, along with a small number of seemingly well-justified assumptions, one can show that diamagnetism is impossible. Nature naturally does not mind this, and experiments show diamagnetic responses from magnetic media. We present a resolution to this issue, which also explains the absence of observed dia-electric responses in media. In the process, we expose some of the short-comings in earlier analyses that have kept the paradox alive.

Title: Antifragility and response to damage in the synchronization of oscillators on networks
Authors: M. A. Polo-González, A. P. Riascos, L. K. Eraso-Hernandez
Abstract: In this paper, we introduce a mathematical framework to assess the impact of damage, defined as the reduction of weight in a specific link, on identical oscillator systems governed by the Kuramoto model and coupled through weighted networks. We analyze how weight modifications in a single link affect the system when its global function is to achieve the synchronization of coupled oscillators starting from random initial phases. We introduce different measures that allow the identification of cases where damage enhances synchronization (antifragile response), deteriorates it (fragile response), or has no significant impact. Using numerical solutions of the Kuramoto model, we investigate the effects of damage on network links where antifragility emerges. Our analysis includes lollipop graphs of varying sizes and a comprehensive evaluation and all the edges of 109 non-isomorphic graphs with six nodes. The approach is general and can be applied to study antifragility in other oscillator systems with different coupling mechanisms, offering a pathway for the quantitative exploration of antifragility in diverse complex systems.

Title: Stabilizer-Accelerated Quantum Many-Body Ground-State Estimation
Authors: Caroline E. P. Robin
Abstract: We investigate how the stabilizer formalism, in particular highly-entangled stabilizer states, can be used to describe the emergence of many-body shape collectivity from individual constituents, in a symmetry-preserving and classically efficient way. The method that we adopt is based on determining an optimal separation of the Hamiltonian into a stabilizer component and a residual part inducing non-stabilizerness. The corresponding stabilizer ground state is efficiently prepared using techniques of graph states and stabilizer tableaux. We demonstrate this technique in context of the Lipkin-Meshkov-Glick model, a fully-connected spin system presenting a second order phase transition from spherical to deformed state. The resulting stabilizer ground state is found to capture to a large extent both bi-partite and collective multi-partite entanglement features of the exact solution in the region of large deformation. We also explore several methods for injecting non-stabilizerness into the system, including ADAPT-VQE, and imaginary-time evolution (ITE) techniques. Stabilizer ground states are found to accelerate ITE convergence due to a larger overlap with the exact ground state. While further investigations are required, the present work suggests that collective features may be associated with high but simple large-scale entanglement which can be captured by stabilizer states, while the interplay with single-particle motion may be responsible for inducing non-stabilizerness. This study motivates applications of the proposed approach to more realistic quantum many-body systems, whose stabilizer ground states can be used in combinations with powerful classical many-body techniques and/or quantum methods.

Abstract: Large Language Models (LLMs) are reshaping many aspects of materials science and chemistry research, enabling advances in molecular property prediction, materials design, scientific automation, knowledge extraction, and more. Recent developments demonstrate that the latest class of models are able to integrate structured and unstructured data, assist in hypothesis generation, and streamline research workflows. To explore the frontier of LLM capabilities across the research lifecycle, we review applications of LLMs through 34 total projects developed during the second annual Large Language Model Hackathon for Applications in Materials Science and Chemistry, a global hybrid event. These projects spanned seven key research areas: (1) molecular and material property prediction, (2) molecular and material design, (3) automation and novel interfaces, (4) scientific communication and education, (5) research data management and automation, (6) hypothesis generation and evaluation, and (7) knowledge extraction and reasoning from the scientific literature. Collectively, these applications illustrate how LLMs serve as versatile predictive models, platforms for rapid prototyping of domain-specific tools, and much more. In particular, improvements in both open source and proprietary LLM performance through the addition of reasoning, additional training data, and new techniques have expanded effectiveness, particularly in low-data environments and interdisciplinary research. As LLMs continue to improve, their integration into scientific workflows presents both new opportunities and new challenges, requiring ongoing exploration, continued refinement, and further research to address reliability, interpretability, and reproducibility.

Title: Observation of optical vortex generation via magnon-induced Brillouin light scattering
Authors: Ryusuke Hisatomi, Alto Osada, Kotaro Taga, Haruka Komiyama, Takuya Takahashi, Shutaro Karube, Yoichi Shiota, Teruo Ono
Abstract: Exploration of physics involving orbital angular momentum (OAM) of light, first recognized in 1992, is essential for deepening our understanding of the interaction between light and matter and that opens up new applications. In systems with rotational symmetry, it is known that OAM can be exchanged between light and matter. One of the most common applications of such a phenomenon is manipulating the optical OAM through the exchange of OAM between light and a nematic liquid crystal-based spatial light modulator (SLM). It is already being used as a tool in many studies related to the optical OAM. However, the operation bandwidth is limited by the response speed 100 Hz of the liquid crystal, which hinders the applications of the optical OAM to spatial division multiplexing, quantum communication, and optical microscopy. The generation of optical vortex beams with the optical OAM in inelastic scattering by elementary excitations with gigahertz-order resonance may solve this problem, although it has not been studied so far. Here, we demonstrate the generation of the optical vortex beams using Brillouin light scattering by magnons without phase singularities. We observe scattering rules in the Brillouin light scattering which can be explained by conservation of total angular momentum including spins and orbits with photons and magnons. This work serves as a starting point for research into the interaction between optical vertices and magnons. It opens up devices with the novel mechanism of optical OAM generation together with high operation bandwidth.

Title: Discrete time quasi-crystal in Rydberg atomic chain
Authors: Xiaofan Luo, Yaoting Zhou, Zhongxiao Xu, Weilun Jiang
Abstract: Discrete time quasi-crystals are non-equilibrium quantum phenomena with quasi-periodic order in the time dimension, and are an extension of the discrete time-crystal phase. As a natural platform to explore the non-equilibrium phase of matter, the Rydberg atomic array has implemented the quantum simulation of the discrete-time crystal phase, associated with quantum many-body scar state. However, the existence of discrete time quasi-crystal on the Rydberg cold atom experiment platform has yet to be conceived. Here, we propose a method to generate the discrete time quasi-crystal behavior by coupling two discrete time-crystals, where associated two external driving frequencies have the maximum incommensurability. While we analysis its robustness and compute the phase diagram of corresponding observables. We significantly calculate the entanglement entropy between two parts of the system. Remarkably, we find the emergence of the aperiodic response is indeed caused by interaction between systems via Rydberg blockade effect. Our method thus offers the possibilities to explore the novel phases in quantum simulator.
