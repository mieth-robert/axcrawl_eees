Title: Pedagogical approach to anomalous position and velocity
Authors: Younsik Kim, Suk Bum Chung, Changyoung Kim
Abstract: In this work, we discuss a pedagogical method in deriving the expressions for anomalous position and velocity. While we follow the steps used in optics in the derivation of the group velocity, we use Bloch wave functions instead of plane wave states. In comparison to the plane wave case, application of Bloch wave functions results in two additional terms in the expression of the group velocity: the Berry phase factor and anomalous position contributions. These two new terms with distinct origins eventually lead to the known anomalous velocity. Aiming for an intuitive understanding, we simulate the situation under an electric field using linear-combination-of-atomic-orbital states and visually demonstrate that the envelope function exhibits the transverse motion expected from an anomalous velocity.

Title: In situ Study of Phase Transitions in La$_2$NiO$_{4+δ}$ using Raman Spectroscopy
Authors: Adeel Riaz, Alexander Stangl, Mónica Burriel, Michel Mermoux
Abstract: La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ has attracted increasing interest in recent years, both as oxygen electrode in solid oxide fuel cells and electrolysers due to its high electrochemical activity at intermediate to high temperatures, and as key component of memristive devices for neuromorphic computing, owing to its variable oxygen stoichiometry. The integration of La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ into devices operating at different temperatures and oxygen partial pressures requires knowledge of the effects of hyper-stoichiometry ($\delta$) on its crystalline structure. La$_2$NiO$_{4+\delta}$ is known to accommodate oxygen at interstitial sites allowing for large delta values, up to ~ 0.16. In addition, the O-doping - temperature phase diagram is known to be complex, exhibiting several phase transitions with increasing delta. Herein, we use Raman spectroscopy to monitor the effects of O-doping in the phase diagram and the various structures it contains. Throughout this work, we studied this material in its usual ceramic form, as well as in the form of thin films. Results are discussed in terms of phase transitions, chemical expansion, and some of the possible consequences of the low mean grain size inherent to such thin films.

Title: Dynamic Models for Two Nonreciprocally Coupled Fields: A Microscopic Derivation for Zero, One, and Two Conservation Laws
Authors: Kristian Blom, Uwe Thiele, Aljaž Godec
Abstract: We construct the dynamic models governing two nonreciprocally coupled fields for cases with zero, one, and two conservation laws. Starting from two microscopic nonreciprocally coupled Ising models, and using the mean-field approximation, we obtain closed-form evolution equations for the spatially resolved magnetization in each lattice. For single spin-flip dynamics, the macroscopic equations in the thermodynamic limit are closely related to the nonreciprocal Allen-Cahn equations, i.e. conservation laws are absent. Likewise, for spin-exchange dynamics within each lattice, the thermodynamic limit yields equations similar to the nonreciprocal Cahn-Hilliard model, i.e. with two conservation laws. In the case of spin-exchange dynamics within and between the two lattices, we obtain two nonreciprocally coupled equations that add up to one conservation law. For each of these cases, we systematically map out the linear instabilities that can arise. Our results provide a microscopic foundation for a broad class of nonreciprocal field theories, establishing a direct link between non-equilibrium statistical mechanics and macroscopic continuum descriptions.

Title: Weyl-Superconductivity revealed by Edge Mode mediated Nonlocal Transport
Authors: Wenyao Liu, Gabriel Natale, Camron Farhang, Michael Geiwitz, Kewen Huang, Qishuo Tan, Xingyao Guo, Mason Gray, Vincent Lamberti, Jazzmin Victorin, Huairuo Zhang, James L.

Davydov, Kin Chung Fong, Ethan Arnault, Genda Gu, Rui-Xing Zhang, Enrico Rossi, Jing Xia, Kenneth S. Burch
Abstract: Topological superconductivity (TSC) hosts exotic modes enabling error-free quantum computation and low-temperature spintronics. Despite preliminary evidence of edge modes, unambiguous signatures remain undetected. Here, we report the first observation of protected, non-local transport from the edge modes of the potential Weyl-superconductor \ch{FeTe_{0.55}Se_{0.45}}. Namely resonant charge injection, ballistic transport, and extraction via edge modes. An anomalous conductance plateau emerges only when topological, superconducting, and magnetic phases coexist, with source-drain contacts coupled via the edge. Moving the drain to the bulk switches the non-local transport process to a local Andreev process, generating a zero-bias conductance peak (ZBCP). The edge mode's topological protection is confirmed by its insensitivity to external magnetic fields and increasing temperatures until the spontaneous magnetization is substantially suppressed. Our findings provide a new methodology to demonstrate TSC edge states in \ch{FeTe_{0.55}Se_{0.45}} via topologically protected non-local transport.

Title: Trade-Offs in EuBa2Cu3Oy Films containing Artificial Pinning Centers: Higher Critical Currents yet Faster Vortex Creep
Authors: Jiangteng Liu, Masashi Miura, Daisaku Yokoe, Takeharu Kato, Akira Ibi, Teruo Izumi, Serena Eley
Abstract: The electromagnetic properties of type-II superconductors depend on vortices-magnetic flux lines whose motion introduces dissipation that can be mitigated by pinning from material defects. The material disorder landscape is tuned by the choice of materials growth technique and incorporation of impurities that serve as vortex pinning centers. For example, metal organic deposition (MOD) and pulsed laser deposition (PLD) produce high-quality superconducting films with uncorrelated versus correlated disorder, respectively. Here, we study vortex dynamics in PLD-grown EuBa2Cu3Oy films containing varying concentrations of BaHfO3 inclusions and compare our results with those of MOD-grown (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films. Despite both systems exhibiting behavior consistent with strong pinning theory, which predicts the critical current density J_c based on vortex trapping by randomly distributed spherical inclusions, we find striking differences in the vortex dynamics owing to the correlated versus uncorrelated disorder. Specifically, we find that the EuBa2Cu3Oy films grown without inclusions exhibit surprisingly slow vortex creep, comparable to the slowest creep rates achieved in (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy films containing high concentrations of BaHfO3. Whereas adding inclusions to (Y,Gd)Ba2Cu3Oy is effective in slowing creep, BaHfO3 increases creep in EuBa2Cu3Oy even while concomitantly improving J_c. Lastly, we find evidence of variable range hopping and that J_c is maximized at the BaHfO3 concentration that hosts a vortex or Bose glass state.

Title: Magnetocrystalline anisotropy of FeNi and FeCo along the Bain path
Authors: Nica Jane B. Ferrer, Gregory A. Fiete
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnetic anisotropy in materials with non-critical elements to determine which symmetry conditions and atomic shell filling favor enhanced magnetic anisotropy. We study the magnetocrystalline anisotropies (MCA) of the equiatomic ferrous compounds FeCo and FeNi using ab initio calculations and analytical approaches via the diatomic pair model. We find that when these materials undergo a Bain transformation, that is, the variation of the a and c lattice parameters adjust to interpolate between the B2 and L10 structural phases while keeping the unit cell volume constant, the MCA versus r = c/a ratio varies differently for FeCo and FeNi despite Co and Ni differing only by one valence electron. To uncover the physics governing these trends, we use a diatomic pair model to perform a theoretical analysis of the ab initio results. We find that the MCA variation along the Bain path is correlated with the structural phase of the material as well as the occupation of (l, m)-resolved states for each equiatomic ferrous compound. Accordingly, the MCA was found to differ depending on the element paired with Fe to form the Fe-X compound (X = Co, Ni). Our work could help guide the scientific community in solving the supply crisis of hard/strong permanent magnets that are crucial for various technological applications such as those depending on motors and generators for energy conversion and clean energy applications.

Title: Localized and quasi-localized energy levels in the electron spectrum of graphene with isolated boron and nitrogen substitutions
Authors: S.B. Feodosyev, V.A. Sirenko, E.S. Syrkin, E.V. Manzhelii, I.S. Bondar, K.A. Minakova
Abstract: Based on the calculation and analysis of local Green functions of impurity atoms of low concentration in a two-dimensional graphene lattice, the conditions for the formation and characteristics of local discrete levels with energies lying outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum and quasi-localized states with energies near the Fermi one are determined. Specific calculations were performed for boron and nitrogen impurity atoms, which can actually replace carbon in graphite and graphene nanostructures. For a boron impurity that forms local discrete levels outside the band of the quasi-continuous spectrum, sufficiently simple analytical expressions for the conditions for their formation, energy, intensity at the impurity atom, and damping parameter are obtained. An analysis of the formation of states quasi-localized on nitrogen impurities with energy near the Fermi level in graphene nanostructures was carried out.

Title: Searching for evidence of strengthening by short-range order in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy
Authors: Novin Rasooli, Matthew Daly
Abstract: The coupling of strength to short-range order (SRO) in the CrCoNi medium entropy alloy remains hotly debated, with conflicting reports supporting and opposing SRO-induced strengthening continuing to emerge. A direct understanding of this effect remains elusive, due to difficulties in the quantification of SRO. Here, we deliver a structurally agnostic analysis that searches for unusual patterns in crystal size effects as evidence of SRO-induced strengthening. For this purpose, we assemble a large dataset of strengthening measurements drawn from a range of thermomechanical processing conditions known to produce SRO. Based on a comparative analysis with pure metal benchmarks, we find no evidence for significant coupling of SRO to strengthening in CrCoNi, and that patterns interpreted as a positive finding are likely explained by cross-study measurement scatter. Nevertheless, we leverage our analysis to provide an upper bound estimate of SRO-induced strengthening in the unlikely scenario where other sources of scatter are negligible.

Title: Tensor network methods for the Gross-Pitaevskii equation on fine grids
Authors: Ryan J. J. Connor, Callum W. Duncan, Andrew J. Daley
Abstract: The Gross-Pitaevskii equation and its generalisations to dissipative and dipolar gases have been very useful in describing dynamics of cold atomic gases, as well as polaritons and other nonlinear systems. For some of these applications the numerically accessible grid spacing can become a limiting factor, especially in describing turbulent dynamics and short-range effects of dipole-dipole interactions. We explore the application of tensor networks to these systems, where (in analogy to related work in fluid and plasma dynamics), they allow for physically motivated data compression that makes simulations possible on large spatial grids which would be unfeasible with direct numerical simulations. Analysing different non-equilibrium cases involving vortex formation, we find that these methods are particularly efficient, especially in combination with a matrix product operator representation of the quantum Fourier transform, which enables a spectral approach to calculation of both equilibrium states and time-dependent dynamics. The efficiency of these methods has interesting physical implications for the structure in the states that are generated by these dynamics, and provides a path to describe cold gas experiments that are challenging for existing methods.

Title: Dynamics of a dark soliton in a curved 1D Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Jorge A. G. Attie, Emanuel A. L. Henn
Abstract: We investigate the nonlinear dynamics of dark solitons in a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate confined to a curved geometry. Using the Gross-Pitaevskii equation in curvilinear coordinates and a perturbative expansion in the local curvature, we derive a set of coupled evolution equations for the soliton velocity and the curvature. For the case of constant curvature, such as circular geometries, the soliton dynamics is governed solely by the initial velocity and curvature. Remarkably, the soliton travels a nearly constant angular trajectory across two orders of magnitude in curvature, suggesting an emergent conserved quantity, independent of its initial velocity. We extend our analysis to elliptical trajectories with spatially varying curvature and show that soliton dynamics remain determined by the local curvature profile. In these cases, the model of effective constant curvature describes accurately the dynamics given the local curvature has smooth variation. When the soliton crosses regions of rapid curvature variation and/or non-monotonic behavior, the model fails to describe to soliton dynamics, although the overall behavior can still be fully mapped to the curvature profile. Our results provide a quantitative framework for understanding the role of geometry in soliton dynamics and pave the way for future studies of nonlinear excitations in curved quantum systems.

Title: Helical spin dynamics in Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ as measured with small-angle neutron scattering
Authors: Victor Ukleev, Priya R. Baral, Robert Cubitt, Nina-Juliane Steinke, Arnaud Magrez, Oleg I. Utesov
Abstract: The insulating chiral magnet Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$ exhibits a rich array of low-temperature magnetic phenomena, making it a prime candidate for the study of its spin dynamics. Using spin wave small-angle neutron scattering (SWSANS), we systematically investigated the temperature-dependent behavior of the helimagnon excitations in the field-polarized phase of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. Our measurements, spanning 5-55 K, reveal the temperature evolution of spin-wave stiffness and damping constant with unprecedented resolution, facilitated by the insulating nature of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$. These findings align with theoretical predictions and resolve discrepancies observed in previous studies, emphasizing the enhanced sensitivity of the SWSANS method. The results provide deeper insights into the fundamental magnetic properties of Cu$_2$OSeO$_3$, contributing to a broader understanding of chiral magnets.

Title: About the Strain-Coupled Molecular Dynamics in the Ferroelastic Phase Transition of TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$
Authors: A. Nonato, R. X. Silva, C.C. Santos, A. P. Ayala, C.W.A. Paschoal
Abstract: Tetramethylammonium (TMA) cadmium azide, is a new perovskite-like compound which undergoes a series of first-order phase transitions, including a ferroelastic transition above room temperature. Understanding the order-disorder structural phase transition (SPT) mechanism in hybrid organic--inorganic perovskites (HOIPs) is crucial for designing new compounds with enhanced barocaloric efficiency, as well as unlocking other multifunctional properties. In this paper, we employed the energy fluctuation (EF) model to investigate the experimental linewidth of Raman modes in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ near the critical phase transition temperature ($T_C = {322}{K}$), aiming to gain insights into the molecular dynamics around the SPT. The temperature dependence of the strain, used as an order parameter, was obtained using the appropriate thermodynamic potential for the first-order phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, expressed through a Landau expansion, which can be successfully employed to model first-order ferroelastic phase transitions. We show that the EF model suitably captures the behavior of the Raman linewidths in the vicinity of the structural phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The activation energies obtained for TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ are comparable to those of DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$, as well as to $k_B T_C$. Additionally, the temperature dependence of the relaxation reveals that the torsional and librational modes require longer to renormalize after the phase transition in TMACd(N$_3$)$_3$ when compared with DMACd(N$_3$)$_3$. The discussion based on these new parameters provides a new perspective for understanding molecular dynamics in systems undergoing order-disorder phase transitions, particularly in ferroelastic transitions, where order-disorder mechanisms are coupled to symmetry-breaking lattice distortions.

Title: Fractional Shapiro steps in a Cavity-Coupled Josephson ring condensate
Authors: Nalinikanta Pradhan, Rina Kanamoto, M. Bhattacharya, Pankaj Kumar Mishra
Abstract: The Josephson effect presents a fundamental example of macroscopic quantum coherence as well as a crucial enabler for metrology (e.g. voltage standard), sensing (e.g. Superconducting Quantum Interference Device) and quantum information processing (Josephson qubits). Recently, there has been a major renewal of interest in the effect, following its observation in Bose, Fermi, and dipolar atomic condensates, in exciton-polariton condensates, and in momentum space. We present theoretically a nondestructive, \textit{in situ} and real time protocol for observing the AC and DC Josephson effects including integer (recently observed in cold atoms) and fractional (hitherto unobserved in cold atoms) Shapiro steps, using a ring condensate coupled to an optical cavity. Our analysis presents a metrology standard that does not require measurmement of atomic number and that challenges the conventional wisdom that quantum computations cannot be observed without being destroyed. Our results have implications for the fields of atomtronics, sensing, metrology and quantum information processing.

Title: Autonomous Fabrication of Tailored Defect Structures in 2D Materials using Machine Learning-enabled Scanning Transmission Electron Microscopy
Authors: Zijie Wu, Kevin M. Roccapriore, Ayana Ghosh, Kai Xiao, Raymond R. Unocic, Stephen Jesse, Rama Vasudevan, Matthew G. Boebinger
Abstract: Materials with tailored quantum properties can be engineered from atomic scale assembly techniques, but existing methods often lack the agility and accuracy to precisely and intelligently control the manufacturing process. Here we demonstrate a fully autonomous approach for fabricating atomic-level defects using electron beams in scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) that combines advanced machine learning and automated beam control. As a proof of concept, we achieved controlled fabrication of MoS-nanowire (MoS-NW) edge structures by iterative and targeted exposure of $MoS_2$ monolayer to a focused electron beam to selectively eject sulfur atoms, utilizing high-angle annular dark-field (HAADF) imaging for feedback-controlled monitoring structural evolution of defects. A machine learning framework combining a random forest model and convolutional neural networks (CNN) was developed to decode the HAADF image and accurately identify atomic positions and species. This atomic-level information was then integrated into an autonomous decision-making platform, which applied predefined fabrication strategies to instruct beam control about atomic sites to be ejected. The selected sites were subsequently exposed to localized electron beam using an FPGA-controlled scan routine with precise control over beam positioning and duration. While the MoS-NW edge structures produced exhibit promising mechanical and electronic properties, the proposed autonomous fabrication framework is material-agnostic and can be extended to other 2D materials for the creation of diverse defect structures and heterostructures beyond $MoS_2$.

Title: Thermodynamic bound on current fluctuations in coherent conductors
Authors: Kay Brandner, Keiji Saito
Abstract: We derive a universal bound on the large-deviation functions of particle currents in coherent conductors. This bound depends only on the mean value of the relevant current and the total rate of entropy production required to maintain a non-equilibrium steady state, thus showing that both typical and rare current fluctuations are ultimately constrained by dissipation. Our analysis relies on the scattering approach to quantum transport and applies to any multi-terminal setup with arbitrary chemical potential and temperature gradients, provided the transmission coefficients between reservoirs are symmetric. This condition is satisfied for any two-terminal system and, more generally, when the dynamics of particles within the conductor are symmetric under time-reversal. For typical current fluctuations, we recover a recently derived thermodynamic uncertainty relation for coherent transport. To illustrate our theory, we analyze a specific model comprising two reservoirs connected by a chain of quantum dots, which shows that our bound can be saturated asymptotically.

Title: Ultralow-loss diamond nanomechanics enabled by van der Waals self-assembly
Authors: Guanhao Huang, Chang Jin, Sophie Weiyi Ding, Marko Lončar
Abstract: Nanomechanical systems are critical platforms for precision measurement, sensing, macroscopic quantum physics, and emerging quantum-information technologies. In these applications, high mechanical quality factors, often achieved using dissipation dilution, are important since they directly enhance measurement sensitivity and quantum coherence. However, surface stiction intrinsic to nanoscale structures severely limits their performance. Here, we transform this longstanding obstacle into a solution for tension-enabled dissipation dilution, via a novel van der Waals (vdW) self-assembly method. Leveraging intrinsic nanoscale surface interactions, we achieve controlled tensile stresses up to 1.3GPa in single-crystal diamond--an ideal but notoriously difficult material to strain-engineer--without introducing additional interface losses. We demonstrate mechanical quality factors exceeding 100 million at 5K, surpassing state-of-the-art systems at comparable aspect ratios. This versatile approach, applicable to other crystalline materials, opens up avenues using cryogenic nanomechanical systems for ultra-precise quantum sensing, tests of quantum gravity, and hybrid quantum systems.

Title: LOMS.cz: A computational platform for high-throughput Classical and Combinatorial Judd-Ofelt analysis and rare-earth spectroscopy
Authors: Jan Hrabovský, Petr Vařák, Robin Kryštůfek
Abstract: We present this http URL (Luminescence, Optical and Magneto-optical Software), an open-source computational platform that addresses the long-standing challenge of standardizing Judd-Ofelt (JO) calculations in rare-earth spectroscopy. Despite JO theory's six-decade history as the fundamental framework for understanding $4f\leftrightarrow4f$ transitions, the field lacks standardized computational methodologies for precise and reproducible parameter determination. LOMS integrates three key innovations: (1) automated computation of JO parameters, transition probabilities, branching ratios, and theoretical radiative lifetimes, (2) a dynamically expanding database of experimentally validated parameters enabling direct comparison between computed and empirical results, and (3) a novel Combinatorial JO (C-JO) analysis algorithm that systematically identifies optimal absorption band combinations to ensure reliable parameter extraction. As a proof-of-concept, we demonstrate how this computational framework enables rapid screening of spectroscopic parameters, allowing researchers to predict optical properties with enhanced reliability. By combining automated analysis with experimental validation through its integrated database, this http URL establishes a standardized platform for accelerating the discovery and optimization of rare-earth-based photonic and optoelectronic materials.

Title: Type-1.5 SNSPD: Interacting vortex theory of two bandgap superconducting single photon detectors
Authors: Leif Bauer, Daien He, Sathwik Bharadwaj, Shunshun Liu, Prasanna V. Balachandran, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Photon detectors based on type-2 superconductors have found widespread applications from on-chip quantum computing to quantum remote sensing. Here, we develop the theory for a new class of type-1.5 superconducting nanowire single photon detectors (SNSPDs) based on two bandgap superconductors with high transition temperatures such as MgB2 (Tc ~38.6K). We show that vortex-vortex interactions in two component condensates lead to a unique operating regime where single photons can seed multiple vortices within a hotspot. We also show that dark counts are suppressed in the type-1.5 regime compared to the widely studied type-2 SNSPDs. Our work opens the door for exploring the unique vortex physics of two-gap superconductors for quantum device applications.

Title: Hydrogen-based direct reduction of multicomponent oxides: Insights from powder and pre-sintered precursors toward sustainable alloy design
Authors: Shiv Shankar, Barak Ratzker, Yan Ma, Dierk Raabe
Abstract: The co-reduction of metal oxide mixtures using hydrogen as a reductant in conjunction with compaction and sintering of the evolving metallic blends offers a promising alternative toward sustainable alloy production through a single, integrated, and synergistic process. Herein, we provide fundamental insights into hydrogen-based direct reduction (HyDR) of distinct oxide precursors that differ by phase composition and morphology. Specifically, we investigate the co-reduction of multicomponent metal oxides targeting a 25Co-25Fe-25Mn-25Ni (at.%) alloy, by using either a compacted powder (mechanically mixed oxides) comprising Co3O4-Fe2O3-Mn2O3-NiO or a pre-sintered compound (chemically mixed oxides) comprising a Co,Ni-rich halite and a Fe,Mn-rich spinel. Thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) at a heating rate of 10 °C/min reveals that the reduction onset temperature for the compacted powder was ~175 °C, whereas it was significantly delayed to ~525 °C for the pre-sintered sample. Nevertheless, both sample types attained a similar reduction degree (~80%) after isothermal holding for 1 h at 700 °C. Phase analysis and microstructural characterization of reduced samples confirmed the presence of metallic Co, Fe, and Ni alongside MnO. A minor fraction of Fe remains unreduced, stabilized in the (Fe,Mn)O halite phase, in accord with thermodynamic calculations. Furthermore, ~1 wt.% of BCC phase was found only in the reduced pre-sintered sample, owing to the different reduction pathways. The kinetics and thermodynamics effects were decoupled by performing HyDR experiments on pulverized pre-sintered samples. These findings demonstrate that initial precursor states influence both the reduction behavior and the microstructural evolution, providing critical insights for the sustainable production of multicomponent alloys.

Title: Scaling particle-size segregation in wide-ranging sheared granular flows
Authors: Tianxiong Zhao, Daisuke Noto, Xia Li, Tomás Trewhela, Hugo N. Ulloa
Abstract: Scaling relationships have been proposed to describe shear-driven size segregation based on intruder experiments and simulations. While these models have shown agreement with experimental and numerical results under uniform shear rate, their validity across varying shear-rate conditions remains uncertain. Here, we employ Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulations to investigate particle size segregation in sheared granular flows under wide-ranging shear-rate conditions. We find that the scaling between segregation velocity and local rheological conditions holds only within a moderate inertial number range ($0.01 < I < 0.1$), and breaks down in both quasi-static and collisional regimes. Furthermore, we show that this discrepancy leads continuum models to mispredict segregation rates in bidisperse mixtures. These findings emphasize the need for more generalized scaling laws capable of capturing segregation dynamics across a broader spectrum of shear-rate conditions and regimes.

Title: Forbidden p-d Orbital Coupling Accelerates High-Power-Factor Materials Discovery
Authors: Wu Xiong, Zhongjuan Han, Zhonghao Xia, Zhilong Yang, Jiangang He
Abstract: The intrinsic entanglement between electrical conductivity ($\sigma$) and the Seebeck coefficient ($S$) significantly constrains power factor (PF) enhancement in thermoelectric (TE) materials. While high valley degeneracy ($N_{\mathrm{vk}}$) effectively balances $\sigma$ and $S$ to improve PF, identifying compounds with high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ remains challenging. In this study, we develop an effective approach to rapid discover $p$-type semiconductors with high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ through manipulating anion-$p$ and cation-$d$ orbital coupling. By prohibiting $p$-$d$ orbital coupling at the $\Gamma$ point, the valence band maximum shifts away from the $\Gamma$ point (where $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$=1), thereby increasing $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$. Through the examination of the common irreducible representations of anion-$p$ and cation-$d$ orbitals at the $\Gamma$ point, we identify 7 compounds with $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ $\ge$ 6 from 921 binary and ternary semiconductors. First-principles calculations with electron-phonon coupling demonstrate that PtP$_2$, PtAs$_2$, and PtS$_2$ exhibit exceptionally high PFs of 130, 127, and 82 $\mu$Wcm$^{-1}$K$^{-2}$ at 300K, respectively, which are three to five times higher than those of the well-studied TE materials. This work not only elucidates the underlying mechanism of high $N_{\mathrm{vk}}$ formation through group theory, but also establishes an efficient high-PF material discovery paradigm, extended to more complex systems.

Title: TeO2-BaO-Bi2O3 tellurite optical glasses II. -- Linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties
Authors: Jan Hrabovský, Jaden R. Love, Lukáš Střižík, Takayuki Ishibashi, Stefan Zollner, Martin Veis
Abstract: The present study investigates the linear and non-linear optical and magneto-optical properties of TeO$_2$-BaO-Bi$_2$O$_3$ (TeBaBi) glasses prepared by the conventional melt-quenching technique at 900 °C. Prepared glass composition ranges across the whole glass-forming-ability (GFA) region focusing on mutual substitution trends of constituent oxides, where TeO$_2$: 55-85 mol.%, BaO: 10-35 mol.%, Bi$_2$O$_3$: 5-15 mol.%. Studied glasses exhibit high values of linear ($n_{632} \approx$ 1.922-2.084) and non-linear refractive index ($n_2\approx$1.63-3.45$\times10^{-11}$ esu), Verdet constant ($V_{632} \approx$ 26.7-45.3 radT$^{-1}$m$^{-1}$) and optical band gap energy ($E_g \approx$ 3.1-3.6 eV). The introduction of TeO$_2$ and Bi$_2$O$_3$ results in increase of both linear/non-linear refractive index and Verdet constant, with a more pronounced influence of Bi$_2$O$_3$. Measured spectral dispersion of refractive index and Verdet constant were used for estimation of magneto-optic anomaly parameter ($\gamma \approx$ 0.71-0.92), which may be used for theoretical modelling of magneto-optic response in diamagnetic TeBaBi glasses. Additionally, the properties of the prepared TeBaBi glasses were directly compared to those of the TeO$_2$-ZnO-BaO glass system, which was prepared and characterized under similar experimental conditions. The compositional dependence of the refractive index in both glass systems was described using multilinear regression analysis, demonstrating high correlation and uniformity of estimation across the entire GFA region. This makes them highly promising for precise dispersion engineering and construction of optical devices operating from visible to mid-infrared spectral region.

Title: D-wave condensates and the landscape of the 2D Hubbard model
Authors: Kazue Matsuyama, Jeff Greensite
Abstract: We consider BCS-like states in the 2D Hubbard model which, starting from some arbitrary point in field space in the neighborhood of a Hartree-Fock ground state, are relaxed within that BCS ansatz to local minima of the energy. As in the Hartree-Fock approximation there are a vast number of local minima. What is new, and unlike the conventional Hartree-Fock states, is that there is a region in parameter (coupling-density) space, where these local minima are associated with d-wave condensates.

Title: Structure and flow of low-dimensional water
Authors: Maxim Trushin, Daria V. Andreeva, Francois M. Peeters, Kostya S. Novoselov
Abstract: Water, a subject of human fascination for millennia, is likely the most studied substance on Earth, with an entire scientific field -- hydrodynamics -- dedicated to understanding water in motion. However, when water flows through one-dimensional or two-dimensional channels, its behavior deviates substantially from the principles of hydrodynamics. This is because reducing the dimensionality of any interacting physical system amplifies interaction effects that are beyond the reach of traditional hydrodynamic equations. In low-dimensional water, hydrogen bonds can become stable enough to arrange water molecules into an ordered state, causing water to behave not only like a liquid but also like a solid in certain respects. In this review, we explore the relationship between water's ordering and its ability to flow in low-dimensional channels, using viscosities of bulk water, vapor, and ice as benchmarks. We also provide a brief overview of the key theoretical approaches available for such analyses and discuss ionic transport, which is heavily influenced by the molecular structure of water.

Title: Floquet spin textures in optically pumped non-Hermitian surface states
Authors: Xiao-Xiao Zhang, Naoto Nagaosa
Abstract: Optical effects of quantum matter with interaction are key to physics and technology. The class of non-Hermitian (NH) phenomena is mostly explored in cold atoms, photonics, and metamaterials out of equilibrium. Effective NH systems due to interaction in equilibrium solids, however, provide a unique opportunity for realizing light-NH matter hybrids via periodic irradiation. Given NH topological surface states with magnetic disorder, here we reveal spectroscopically observable Floquet spin textures for this hybrid quantum matter: merged meron strings, dichroic skyrmions, and domain structure accompanying vortices in energy planes; Bloch lines and topologically twisted vortex rings distinct from Hopfions in energy-momentum space; topological selectiveness of linear polarization occurs besides circular dichroism. Spectroscopic energy evolution and chemical potential dependence are key ingredients of this open hybrid system. With spin-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, this scenario bears prime physical interest by reaching the crossroad between solid-state interaction effects, non-Hermiticity, and light-matter coupling.

Title: Conformal Operator Flows of the Deconfined Quantum Criticality from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$
Authors: Shuai Yang, Liang-dong Hu, Chao Han, W. Zhu, Yan Chen
Abstract: The deconfined quantum critical point (DQCP), which separates two distinct symmetry-broken phases, was conjectured to be an example of (2+1)D criticality beyond the standard Landau-Ginzburg-Wilson paradigm. However, this hypothesis has been met with challenges and remains elusive. Here, we perform a systematic study of a microscopic model realizing the DQCP with a global symmetry tunable from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$. Through the lens of fuzzy sphere regularization, we uncover the key information on the renormalization group flow of conformal operators. We reveal O(4) primaries decomposed from original SO(5) primaries by tracing conformal operator content and identifying the ``avoided level crossing'' in the operator flows. In particular, we find that the existence of a scalar operator, in support of the nature of pseudo-criticality, remains relevant, persisting from $\mathrm{SO}(5)$ to $\mathrm{O}(4)$ DQCP. This work not only uncovers the nature of O(4) DQCP but also demonstrates that the fuzzy sphere scheme offers a unique perspective on the renormalization group flow of operators in the study of critical phenomena.

Title: Realization of a Kondo Insulator in a Multilayer Moire Superlattice
Authors: Qiran Wu, Jingyuan Cui, Ang-Kun Wu, Yuze Meng, Dongxue Chen, Li Yan, Lei Ma, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Shi-Zeng Lin, Su-Fei Shi, Yong-Tao Cui
Abstract: Kondo insulators are a paradigmatic strongly correlated electron system, arising from the hybridization between itinerary conduction electrons and localized magnetic moments, which opens a gap in the band of conduction electrons. Traditionally, the known Kondo insulators are found in materials with f-electrons. Recent developments in two-dimensional (2D) moire systems provide a new approach to generate flat bands with strong electron correlation, which host localized moments at half filling. In this work, we demonstrate the realization of a Kondo insulator phase in a moire superlattice of monolayer WS2 / bilayer WSe2 which hosts a set of moire flat bands in the WSe2 layer interfacing the WS2 layer and dispersive bands in the other WSe2 layer. When both WSe2 layers are partially doped but with a total density of two holes per moire unit cell, an insulating state appears when the density of the moire band is below one hole per moire unit cell. The insulating state disappears above a certain threshold magnetic field and the system becomes metallic, which is a telltale signature of the Kondo insulator. The physics can be well explained by a periodic Anderson lattice model that includes both the on-site Coulomb repulsion in the moire flat band and the hybridization between moire flat and non-moire dispersive bands. Our results suggest that multilayer moire structures of transition metal dichalcogenides provide a tunable platform to simulate the Kondo insulator, which holds promise to tackle many critical open questions in the Kondo insulators.

Title: Electronic structure and defect properties of Bi-doped GaN: origins of photoluminescence and optical absorption
Authors: Yujie Liu, Ishtiaque Ahmed Navid, Zetian Mi, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Extreme lattice-mismatched III-V nitrides, such as Bi-incorporated GaN, have been realized experimentally thanks to recent advances in epitaxial growth and characterization techniques. However, theoretical insights into defect-related optical absorption and emission phenomena in these materials remain scarce. Here, we apply hybrid density functional theory to systematically explore the role of substitutional bismuth atoms on both cationic $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and anionic $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ sites in Bi-incorporated GaN, as well as their complexes with native vacancies. Our calculations reveal that the charge-compensated defect complexes $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3-}$ and $(\mathrm{Bi_{N}} + \mathrm{V_{Ga}})^{3+}$ stabilize anionic bismuth incorporation, accounting for the experimentally observed absorption peaks at ~1.11 eV and ~3.17 eV. We further uncover the origins of the reported band-edge emissions near 2.0 eV and 2.5 eV by examining various charge states of $\mathrm{Bi_{Ga}}$ and $\mathrm{Bi_{N}}$ centers. Our findings elucidate the defect-level physics of Bi-doped GaN and provide practical guidelines for controlling the incorporation of Bi into GaN.

Title: Reliable Magnetometry for Antiferromagnets and Thin Films: Correcting Substrate Artifacts in Mn3Sn/MgO Systems
Authors: Katarzyna Gas, Maciej Sawicki
Abstract: The rapid progress in antiferromagnetic and altermagnetic spintronics has led to increased interest in magnetic materials with vanishing net magnetization but strong spin-dependent transport properties. As thin films of such materials become central to device concepts, precise magnetic characterization is essential, for quantify intrinsic moments, and interpret transport signatures such as the anomalous Hall effect. In this work, we show that commercial MgO substrates, commonly used in epitaxial growth, often produce substantial parasitic magnetic signals that can match or exceed the response of weakly magnetic films. We identify two major components: a low-field ferromagnetic-like contribution originating from epi-ready surface, and a temperature-dependent paramagnetic background associated with dilute bulk impurities. These artifacts vary between samples and cannot be corrected using standard linear background subtraction or a measured reference substrate. To address this, we develop and put forward a compensation scheme which combines two complementary, non-destructive measurement protocols. We demonstrate up to 97% efficacy without requiring prior measurements of the bare substrate. The proposed framework enables reliable extraction of intrinsic magnetic signals and provides a general strategy for high-fidelity magnetometry in weakly magnetic thin-film systems, including emerging classes of materials such as topological phases and two-dimensional magnets. We also report the diamagnetic susceptibility of crystalline MgO, chi_MgO = -4.0 x 10^-7 emu/g/Oe.

Title: Two-Dimensional Superconductivity at the CaZrO3/KTaO3 (001) Heterointerfaces
Authors: Lu Chen, Siyi Zhou, Daming Tian, Yinan Xiao, Qixuan Gao, Yongchao Wang, Yuansha Chen, Fengxia Hu, Baogen Shen, Jirong Sun, Weisheng Zhao, Jinsong Zhang, Hui Zhang
Abstract: We investigated the superconducting transport properties of two-dimensional electron gases (2DEGs) at (001)-oriented CaZrO3/KTaO3 (CZO/KTO) heterointerfaces. Our results unambiguously demonstrate the emergence of two-dimensional superconductivity, with a superconducting transition TC up to ~0.25 K. The two-dimensional nature of the superconducting state is corroborated by the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) transition and pronounced anisotropy of the upper critical field. The estimated superconducting layer thickness and coherence length are 10.1 nm and 146.4 nm, respectively, for the sample with nS=7.7*10^13 cm^-2. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the two-dimensional superconductivity at the CZO/KTO(001) interface can be effectively tuned by applying a back gate voltage. These findings conclusively establish two-dimensional superconductivity at the CZO/KTO(001) interfaces, providing a new platform for exploring emergent superconductivity in complex oxide heterostructures.

Title: Magnetic Ground State and Spin Excitations in the 2D Trimerized Collinear-II Lattice Antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14
Authors: K. S. Chikara, A. K. Bera, A. Kumar, S. M. Yusuf, F. Orlandi, C. Balz
Abstract: We report the magnetic ground state, spin excitations, and spin Hamiltonian of the 2D spin-1 trimerized Heisenberg antiferromagnet Li2Ni3P4O14. Below the magnetic ordering temperature TN = 14.5 K, the compound exhibits a canted long-range antiferromagnetic order with a propagation vector k = (0 0 0), consistent with the magnetic space group P21/c.1 (No. 14.75). The ground state magnetic structure consists of ferromagnetic spin-trimers of Ni2+ ions. The spin-trimers are coupled antiferromagnetically along the c-axis and ferromagnetically along the a-axis. Inelastic neutron scattering (INS) reveals gapped and dispersive magnon excitations below the TN, and gapless quasi-elastic scatterings at higher temperature. The linear spin-wave theory simulations reveal the essential features of the excitation spectrum; by a spin Hamiltonian composed of ferromagnetic intra-trimer exchange interaction J1 and inter-trimer exchange interactions J2 (FM) and J3(AFM) within the bc plane. The J2 and J3 along the b-axis and c-axis, respectively, with strengths of J2/J1=0.79 and J3/J1=-0.91. In addition, a weak inter planer ferromagnetic exchange interaction J4 (|J4/J1|~0.12) is found along the a-axis. The determined exchange constants reveal a 2D trimerized Collinear-II spin lattice within the bc-plane. The analysis of INS spectra by linear spin-wave theory also yields a moderate single-ion anisotropy (D/J1=0.48) which accounts for the observed spin gap below TN as well as the metamagnetic transition near 44 kOe in dc magnetization (M vs H) curves. These findings identify Li2Ni3P4O14 as a rare realization of a two-dimensional trimerized spin system and offer the direct experimental confirmation of theoretically predicted magnon excitations, unveiling the fundamental characteristics of the expected excitation spectrum.

Title: Interaction-induced magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the Hall effect in massive-massless fermion mixtures
Authors: Yuping Huang, D. S. Eliseev, V. M. Kovalev, O. V. Kibis, Yu. Yu. Illarionov, I. G. Savenko
Abstract: The presence of two types of holes, namely the Dirac holes and the heavy holes, in a two-dimensional sample exposed to a weak external permanent magnetic field leads to the emergence of the temperature and magnetic field-dependent contribution to the resistivity due to their interactions. Taking a HgTe-based two-dimensional semimetal as a testbed, we develop a theoretical model describing the role of interactions between the degenerate massive and Dirac particles for the resistivity in the presence of a classical magnetic field. If only the Dirac holes are present in the system, the magnetoconductivity acquires a finite interaction-induced contribution which would be vanishing for the parabolic spectrum. It demonstrates $T^4 \ln(1/T)$ behavior at low temperatures for screened Coulomb interhole interaction potential, asymptotically reaching $T^2$ with increasing temperature. However, the magnetoresistivity and the Hall effect are not affected by the Dirac holes interparticle correlations. Instead, the presence of two types of holes provides a finite contribution to the magnetoconductivity, magnetoresistivity, and the classical Hall effect resistivity. The temperature behavior of the magnetoconductivity here is $T^2$ in the case of the short-range constant interparticle interaciton potential and $T^2 \ln(1/T)$ for the bare unscreened Coulomb interaction.

Title: Quantum Anharmonic Effects in Hydrogen-Bond Symmetrization of High-Pressure Ice
Authors: Qi Zhang, Lei Wang
Abstract: The nuclear quantum effects of hydrogen play a significant role in determining the phase stability of water ice. Hydrogen-bond symmetrization occurs as hydrogen atoms tunnel in a double-well potential, ultimately occupying the midpoint between oxygen atoms and transforming ice VIII into ice X under high pressure. Quantum fluctuations lower this transition from classical predictions of over 100 GPa to 60 GPa. We reveal that the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional underestimates the hydrogen double-well barrier, thus resulting in a transition pressure over 10 GPa lower than the strongly constrained and appropriately normed functional, which is validated against quantum Monte Carlo calculations. Nuclear quantum anharmonicity, treated via neural canonical transformation (NCT), reveals that this transition pressure is temperature-independent and observes a 2 GPa reduction when comparing the non-Gaussian flow models based wavefunction compared to the self-consistent harmonic approximation. Despite increasing pressure typically shortens chemical bonds and hardens phonon modes, NCT calculations reveal that hydrogen bond softens hydrogen-oxygen stretching in ice VIII upon pressure.

Title: The principle of least action for random graphs
Authors: Ioannis Kleftogiannis, Ilias Amanatidis
Abstract: We study the statistical properties of the physical action $S$ for random graphs, by treating the number of neighbors at each vertex of the graph (degree), as a scalar field. For each configuration (run) of the graph we calculate the Lagrangian of the degree field by using a lattice quantum field theory(LQFT) approach. Then the corresponding action is calculated by integrating the Lagrangian over all the vertices of the graph. We implement an evolution mechanism for the graph by removing one edge per a fundamental quantum of time, resulting in different evolution paths based on the run that is chosen at each evolution step. We calculate the action along each of these evolution paths, which allows us to calculate the probability distribution of $S$. We find that the distribution approaches the normal(Gaussian) form as the graph becomes denser, by adding more edges between its vertices. The maximum of the probability distribution of the action corresponds to graph configurations whose spacing between the values of $S$ becomes zero $\Delta S=0$, corresponding to the least-action (Hamilton) principle, which gives the path that the physical system follows classically. In addition, we calculate the fluctuations(variance) of the degree field showing that the graph configurations corresponding to the maximum probability of $S$, which follow the Hamilton's principle, have a balanced structure between regular and irregular graphs.

Title: Spin Systems Coupled to Photons: A Case study of Phase Transition in a One-Dimensional Classical Ferromagnetic Ising Spin Chain at Finite Temperature
Authors: Shuntaro Otake, Motoaki Bamba
Abstract: Although one-dimensional classical spin chains do not exhibit phase transitions, we found that a phase transition does occur when they are coupled to a cavity photon mode. This provides one of the simplest examples demonstrating that finite-temperature superradiant phase transitions can emerge from long-range fully connected interactions mediated by photons and interactions within the material.

Title: Levy-driven temporally quenched dynamic critical behavior in directed percolation
Authors: Yanyang Wang, Yuxiang Yang, Wei Li
Abstract: Quenched disorder in absorbing phase transitions can disrupt the structure and symmetry of reaction-diffusion processes, affecting their phase transition characteristics and offering a more accurate mapping to real physical systems. In the directed percolation (DP) universality class, time quenching is implemented through the dynamic setting of transition probabilities. We developed a non-uniform distribution time quenching method in the (1+1)-dimensional DP model, where the random quenching follows a Lévy distribution. We use Monte Carlo (MC) simulations to study its phase structure and universality class. The critical point measurements show that this model has a critical region controlling the transition between the absorbing and active states, which changes as the parameter $ \beta $, influencing the distribution properties varies. Guided by dynamic scaling laws, we measured the continuous variation of critical exponents: particle density decay exponent $\alpha$, total particle number change exponent $ \theta $, and dynamic exponent $z$. This evidence establishes that the universality class of Lévy-quenched DP systems evolves with distribution properties. The Lévy-distributed quenching mechanism we introduced has broad potential applications in the theory and experiments of various absorbing phase transitions.

Title: The effect of doping layers position on the heterojunction sharpness in (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots
Authors: T. S. Shamirzaev, D. R. Yakovlev, M. Bayer
Abstract: Effect of doped layer placed in structures with indirect band-gap (In,Al)As/AlAs quantum dots (QDs) on heterointerface sharpness is investigated. We demonstrate that growth of n (p) doped layer below QDs sheet leads to pronounced deceleration (acceleration) for dynamics of exciton recombination (which is very sensitive to heterointeface structure in these QDs) in compare with the undoped structure. Opposite, the placing of the same doped layers above the QDs sheet does not effect on the exciton recombination dynamic at all. The experimental data are explained by increase (decrease) charged vacancy formation rate in the cation sublattice, that result in QD/matrix interface bluring (sharping), with the increases in the electron (hole) concentration at this heterointerface formation. The thicknesses of the diffuse layer on QD/matrix heterointerface estimated is in range from 0 up to 5 in the lattice constant depending on doped layer placing.

Title: Looking Back: Field theory of transiently chiral active particles
Authors: Callum Britton, Gunnar Pruessner, Thibault Bertrand
Abstract: We derive a Doi-Peliti Field Theory for transiently chiral active particles in two dimensions, that is, active Brownian particles that undergo tumbles via a diffusing reorientation angle. Using this framework, we compute the mean squared displacement for both uniformly distributed and fixed initial reorientations. We also calculate an array of orientation-based observables, to quantify the transiently chiral behaviour observed.

Title: Defects Potentials for Two-Dimensional Topological Materials
Authors: Yuval Abulafia, Amit Goft, Nadav Orion, Eric Akkermans
Abstract: For non-topological quantum materials, introducing defects can significantly alter their properties by modifying symmetry and generating a nonzero analytical index, thus transforming the material into a topological one. We present a method to construct the potential matrix configuration with the purpose of obtaining a non-zero analytical index, akin to a topological invariant like a winding or Chern number. We establish systematic connections between these potentials, expressed in the continuum limit, and their initial tight-binding model description. We apply our method to graphene with an adatom, a vacancy, and both as key examples illustrating our comprehensive description. This method enables analytical differentiation between topological and non-topological zero-energy modes and allows for the construction of defects that induce topology.

Title: A reentrancy of motility-induced phase separation in overdamped active Brownian particles
Authors: Hiroya Yamamoto
Abstract: In a system of Self-Propelled Particles (SPPs), the combination of self-propulsion and excluded volume effects can result in a phase separation called Motility-Induced Phase Separation (MIPS). Previous studies reported that MIPS is one of the phenomena so-called "reentrant phase separation" ,i.e., MIPS is suppressed when the Péclet number $Pe$ (dimensionless self-propelled speed) is sufficiently large. We used a fundamental model of SPPs, i.e., overdamped Active Brownian Partcles (ABPs), to investigate the mechanism of the reentrancy of MIPS. We expect that elucidating the conditions under which MIPS occur is important, since MIPS is a phenomenon that can occur in a wide range of SPPs systems, and the potential applications of MIPS can also be wide range. Detailed investigation of particle motion revealed that a entire particle cluster deforms due to multiple slip deformation (known as plastic deformation in materials science). As $Pe$ increases, the frequency of occurrence of slip-lines increases, and the particle motion becomes fluid-like. Therefore, the shape of the cluster becomes unstable and the number of particles in the cluster decreases. Let $\bf{f}_{LA}$ be the local spatial average of the self-propelled force generated by the particles. The observation of the inhomogeneity in the magnitude and direction of $\bf{f}_{LA}$ shows that $\bf{f}_{LA}$ is large on the cluster surface and generally orients toward the cluster inside. We determined that $\bf{f}_{LA}$ generates stress on the cluster, and it causes the multiple slip deformation.

Title: Prenematic Fluctuations in Nanoparticle-Hosted Systems
Authors: Szymon Starzonek, Krzysztof Górny, Zbigniew Dendzik, Dejvid Črešnar, Aleš Iglič
Abstract: This study combines broadband dielectric spectroscopy (BDS) experiments with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations to investigate the influence of nanoparticle (NP) inclusions on pretransitional phenomena in a liquid crystal (LC) host. We aimed to fill the existing gap between macroscopic observations and their microscopic origins. Our experimental results on SiO$_2$-doped 5CB composites demonstrate that while NP additions do not significantly change the isotropic-nematic transition temperature ($T_c$), the pretransitional effects exhibit universal behavior, confirmed by identical critical exponents across all samples. The observed systematic decrease in dielectric permittivity is explained by MD simulations, which reveal that nanoparticles act as "seeds" for topological defects, forcing the surrounding LC molecules into a "hedgehog" configuration. This static, defect-induced structure leads to a local antiparallel alignment and cancellation of molecular dipoles, providing a direct microscopic mechanism for the macroscopic dielectric response and successfully bridging the micro-macro scales.

Title: Low-temperature anomalies in 1D hard rods with soft attractive nearest-neighbor interactions
Authors: Igor Travěnec, Ladislav Šamaj
Abstract: Previous experiments and numerical simulations have revealed that a limited number of two- and three-dimensional particle systems contract in volume upon heating isobarically. This anomalous phenomenon is known as negative thermal expansion (NTE). Recently, in a study by [I. Travěnec and L. Šamaj: J. Phys. A: Math. Theor. {\bf 58}, 195005 (2025)], exactly solvable one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with various types of soft purely repulsive nearest-neighbor interactions were examined at low temperatures. The presence of the NTE anomaly in such systems heavily depends on the shape of the core-softened potential and, in some cases, is associated with jumps in chain spacing of the equidistant ground state at certain pressures. This paper focuses on one-dimensional fluids of hard rods with soft nearest-neighbor interactions that contain a basin of attraction with just one minimum. The ground-state analysis reveals that, for certain potentials, increasing the pressure can lead to a discontinuous jump in the mean spacing between particles. The low-temperature analysis of the exact equation of state indicates that the NTE anomaly is present if the curvature of the interaction potential increases with the distance between particles or if the potential exhibits a singularity within the basin of attraction. Isotherms of the compressibility factor, which measures the deviation of the thermodynamic behavior of a real gas from that of an ideal gas, demonstrate typical plateau or double-plateau shapes in large intervals of particle density.

Title: Rashba-induced spin Hall response in a disordered $WTe_2$ four-terminal structure
Authors: Swastik Sahoo, Satadeep Bhattacharjee, Bhaskaran Muralidharan
Abstract: The paramount acumen for controlling spin transport properties in nonmagnetic materials is the usage of spin-orbit coupling (SOC). We propose a model to calculate the spin hall angle (SHA) for the elemental transition metal dichalcogenide compound, $WTe_2$ entrenched on the intrinsic Rashba SOC. This model, is based on the Landauer-Buttiker formalism for quantum transport, and the $4$-terminal device setup with the presence of disorder from random onsite potential fluctuations. The SHA, including the mean and RMS values, also illustrate the mesoscopic oscillations, and the values obtained are $25\%$ and $30\%$, respectively. The variation pattern of charge and spin current, along with the mean and spin Hall conductance, can be a comparative measure for other TMDs and monolayer Xenes. To validate our outcomes, we compare our results with experimental data and numerically extract real-space simulation results based on the nearest-neighbor tight binding (NNTB) model. Also our results are in line with the scaling theory of localization. This work sets the stage to calculate the spin Hall angle and spin Hall conductivity for other elemental monolayer Xenes and TMDs, considering the intrinsic scattering mechanisms. An extension of this work will be to explore the possible spintronics applications for extrinsic scattering, including side-jump and skew-jump scattering processes.

Title: Tunable Dot Platform for Controlling Electron Flow in Graphene
Authors: Fereshte Ildarabadi, Stephen R. Power
Abstract: We introduce an innovative graphene-based architecture to control electronic current flows. The tunable dot platform (TDP) consists of an array of gated dots, with independently adjustable potentials, embedded in graphene. Inspired by Mie theory, and leveraging multiscattering effects, we demonstrate that tailored current behavior can be achieved due to the variety of possible dot configurations. Optimization is performed using differential evolution, which identifies configurations that maximize specific objectives, such as directing or splitting an electron beam by tuning the angular dependence of scattering. Our results demonstrate the potential of the TDP to provide precise control over induced current flows in graphene, making it a promising component for next-generation electronic and electron optic devices.

Abstract: Protecting qubits from noise is essential for building reliable quantum computers. Topological qubits offer a route to this goal by encoding quantum information non-locally, using pairs of Majorana zero modes. These modes form a shared fermionic state whose occupation -- either even or odd -- defines the fermionic parity that encodes the qubit. Crucially, this parity cannot be accessed by any measurement that probes only one Majorana mode. This reflects the non-local nature of the encoding and its inherent protection against noise. A promising platform for realizing such qubits is the Kitaev chain, implemented in quantum dots coupled via superconductors. Even a minimal chain of two dots can host a pair of Majorana modes and store quantum information in their joint parity. Here we introduce a new technique for reading out this parity, based on quantum capacitance. This global probe senses the joint state of the chain and enables real-time, single-shot discrimination of the parity state. By comparing with simultaneous local charge sensing, we confirm that only the global signal resolves the parity. We observe random telegraph switching and extract parity lifetimes exceeding one millisecond. These results establish the essential readout step for time-domain control of Majorana qubits, resolving a long-standing experimental challenge.

Abstract: Antiferroelectrics are emerging as advanced functional materials and are fertile ground for unusual electric effects. For example, they enhance the recoverable energy density in energy storage applications and give rise to large electromechanical responses. Here, we demonstrate noncollinearity in dipolar order as an additional degree of freedom, unlocking physical properties that are symmetry-forbidden in classical antiferroelectrics. We show that noncollinear order of electric dipole moments in K$_3$[Nb$_3$O$_6$|(BO$_3$)$_2$] leads to a coexistence of antiferroelectric and ferroelectric behaviors. Besides the double-hysteresis loop observed in antiferroelectrics, a pronounced piezoresponse and electrically switchable domains are observed, separated by atomically sharp and micrometer-long charged domain walls. Hybrid antiferroelectric-ferroelectric responses are expected in a wide range of noncollinear systems, giving a new dimension to the research on antiferroelectrics and multifunctional oxides in general.

Title: Impurity immersed in a two-component few-fermion mixture in a one-dimensional harmonic trap
Authors: Marek Teske, Tomasz Sowiński
Abstract: We investigate a one-dimensional three-component few-fermion mixture confined in a parabolic external trap, where one component contains a single particle acting as an impurity. Focusing on the many-body ground state, we analyze how the interactions between the impurity and the other components influence the system's structure. For fixed interaction strengths within the mixture, we identify a critical interaction strength with the impurity for which the system undergoes a structural transition characterized by substantial change in its spatial features. We explore this transition from the point of view of correlations and ground-state susceptibility. We remarkably find that this transition exhibits unique universality features not previously observed in other systems, highlighting novel many-body properties existing in multi-component fermionic mixtures.

Title: Spin-disorder-induced angular anisotropy in polarized magnetic neutron scattering

Abstract: We experimentally report a hitherto unseen angular anisotropy in the polarized small-angle neutron scattering (SANS) cross section of a magnetically strongly inhomogeneous material. Based on an analytical prediction using micromagnetic theory, the difference between the spin-up and spin-down SANS cross sections is expected to show a spin-disorder-induced anisotropy. The effect is particularly pronounced in inhomogeneous magnetic materials, such as nanoporous ferromagnets, magnetic nanocomposites, or steels, which exhibit large nanoscale jumps in the saturation magnetization at internal pore-matrix or particle-matrix interfaces. Analysis of the experimental neutron data constitutes a method for determining the exchange-stiffness constant. Our results are generic to the nuclear-magnetic interference terms contained in the polarized magnetic neutron scattering cross section and might also be of relevance to other neutron techniques.

Title: Extremely Low Frequency Plasmons in Metallic Microstructures
Authors: JB Pendry, AJ Holden, WJ Stewart, I Youngs
Abstract: The plasmon is a well established collective excitation of metals in the visible and near UV but at much lower frequencies dissipation destroys all trace of the plasmon and typical Drude behaviour sets in. We propose a mechanism for depression of the plasma frequency into the far infra red or even GHz band: periodic structures build of very thin wires dilute the average concentration of electrons and considerably enhance the effective electron mass through self-inductance. Computations replicate the key features and confirm our analytic theory. The new structure has novel properties not observed before in the GHz band, including some possible impact on superconducting properties.

Title: Phototactic Decision-Making by Micro-Algae
Authors: Shantanu Raikwar, Adham Al-Kassem, Nir S. Gov, Adriana I. Pesci, Raphaël Jeanneret, Raymond E. Goldstein
Abstract: We study how simple eukaryotic organisms make decisions in response to competing stimuli in the context of phototaxis by the unicellular alga $Chlamydomonas~reinhardtii$. While negatively phototactic cells swim directly away from a collimated light beam, when presented with two beams of adjustable intersection angle and intensities, we find that cells swim in a direction given by an intensity-weighted average of the two light propagation vectors. This geometrical law is a fixed point of an adaptive model of phototaxis and minimizes the average light intensity falling on the anterior pole of the cell. At large angular separations, subpopulations of cells swim away from one source or the other, or along the direction of the geometrical law, with some cells stochastically switching between the three directions. This behavior is shown to arise from a population-level distribution of photoreceptor locations that breaks front-back symmetry of photoreception.

Title: Common superconducting transition in under and overdoped cuprate superconductors
Authors: Hércules H. Santana and, E. V. L. de Mello
Abstract: Underdoped cuprate superconductors are believed to be strongly correlated with electronic systems with small phase stiffness leading to a large phase fluctuation region is known as the pseudogap state. With increasing doping it is generally agree that they become Fermi liquid, rendering the end of the superconductivity due to the sufficiently large electronic screening. However, this scenario does not stand against a recent experiment\cite{OverJJ2022} that combined magnetic susceptibility and Scanning Tunnelling Microscopy (STM) which measured superconducting gaps and amplitudes amid charge inhomogeneity far beyond the critical doping $p_{\rm c} \approx 0.27$. We reproduced these results by calculating the localized superconducting amplitudes that emerge out of charge inhomogeneities, which forms a mesoscopic granular superconductor with an array of Josephson junctions, whose average couplings determine the critical temperature $T_{\rm c}$. The calculations agree with the experiments and both yield that underdoped and overdoped compounds have superconducting long-range order by the same mechanism.

Title: More sophisticated is not always better: comparison of similarity measures for unsupervised learning of pathways in biomolecular simulations
Authors: Miriam Jäger, Steffen Wolf
Abstract: Finding process pathways in molecular simulations such as the unbinding paths of small molecule ligands from their binding sites at protein targets in a set of trajectories via unsupervised learning approaches requires the definition of a suitable similarity measure between trajectories. We here evaluate the performance of four such measures with varying degree of sophistication, i.e., Euclidean and Wasserstein distances, Procrustes analysis and dynamical time warping, when analyzing trajectory data from two different biased simulation driving protocols in the form of constant velocity constraint targeted MD and steered MD. In a streptavidin-biotin benchmark system with known ground truth clusters, Wasserstein distances yielded the best clustering performance, closely followed by Euclidean distances, both being the most computationally efficient similarity measures. In a more complex A2a receptor-inhibitor system, however, the simplest measure, i.e., Euclidean distances, was sufficient to reveal meaningful and interpretable clusters.

Title: Electrostatics overcome acoustic collapse to assemble, adapt, and activate levitated matter
Authors: Sue Shi, Maximilian C. Hübl, Galien P. Grosjean, Carl P. Goodrich, Scott R. Waitukaitis
Abstract: Acoustic levitation provides a unique method for manipulating small particles as it completely evades effects from gravity, container walls, or physical handling. These advantages make it a tantalizing platform for studying complex phenomena in many-particle systems, save for one severe limitation -- particles suspended by sound interact via acoustic scattering forces, which cause them to merge into a single dense object. To overcome this "acoustic collapse", we have developed a strategy that combines acoustic levitation with controlled electrostatic charging to assemble, adapt, and activate complex, many-particle systems. The key idea is to introduce electrostatic repulsion, which renders a so-called "mermaid" potential where interactions are attractive at short range and repulsive at long range. By controlling the balance between attraction/repulsion, we are able to levitate fully expanded structures where all particles are separated, fully collapsed structures where they are all in contact, and hybrid ones consisting of both expanded and collapsed components. We find that fully collapsed and expanded structures are inherently stable, whereas hybrid ones exhibit transient stability governed by acoustically unstable dimers. Furthermore, we show how electrostatics allow us to adapt between configurations on the fly, either by quasistatic discharge or discrete up/down charge steps. Finally, we demonstrate how large structures experience selective energy pumping from the acoustic field -- thrusting some particles into motion while others remain stationary -- leading to complex dynamics including coupled rotations and oscillations. Our approach provides an easy-to-implement and easy-to-understand solution to the pervasive problem of acoustic collapse, while simultaneously providing new insights into the assembly and activation of many-particle systems with complex interactions.

Abstract: Most superconducting materials are well-understood and conventional in the sense that the pairs of electrons that cause the superconductivity by their condensation have the highest possible symmetry. Famous exceptions are the enigmatic high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors. Nodes in their superconducting gap are the fingerprint of their unconventional character and imply superconducting pairing of $d$-wave symmetry. Here, using angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy, we observe that the Weyl semimetal PtBi$_2$ harbors nodes in its superconducting gap, implying unconventional $i$-wave pairing symmetry. At temperatures below $10\,\mathrm{K}$, the superconductivity in PtBi$_2$ gaps out its topological surface states, the Fermi arcs, while its bulk states remain normal. The nodes in the superconducting gap that we observe are located exactly at the center of the Fermi arcs, and imply the presence of topologically protected Majorana cones around this locus in momentum space. From this, we infer theoretically that robust zero-energy Majorana flat bands emerge at surface step edges. This not only establishes PtBi$_2$ surfaces as unconventional, topological $i$-wave superconductors but also as a promising material platform in the ongoing effort to generate and manipulate Majorana bound states.

Abstract: Optically induced demagnetization of 3d metallic ferromagnets proceeds as fast as ~100 fs and is a crucial prerequisite for spintronic applications, such as ultrafast magnetization switching and spin transport. On the 100 fs time scale, the magnetization dynamics is widely understood in the context of temperature models considering energy transfers between conduction electrons, magnons and crystal lattice. However, on even faster time scales, the flow of both angular momentum and energy between these subsystems has so far not been studied. Here, we measure ultrafast demagnetization by ultrabroadband THz-emission spectroscopy. We find that the rate of change of the magnetization does not rise instantaneously, but on a time scale as short as 10 fs. This rise is a signature that a transfer of angular momentum from the magnons to conduction electrons proceeds in less than 10 fs, before substantial demagnetization has happened. We further conclude that most of the spin dissipated by the lattice is transferred via magnon-lattice rather than electron-lattice interaction. These results show that the limiting speed of magnetization dynamics is not demagnetization, as generally believed, and harnessing the earliest magnon dynamics could be a new route towards an even faster spintronics.

Title: Midveins regulate the shape formation of drying leaves
Authors: Kexin Guo, Yafei Zhang, Massimo Paradiso, Yuchen Long, K. Jimmy Hsia, Mingchao Liu
Abstract: Dried leaves in nature often exhibit curled and crumpled morphologies, typically attributed to internal strain gradients that produce dome-like shapes. However, the origin of these strain gradients remains poorly understood. Although leaf veins--particularly the midvein--have been suggested to influence shape formation, their mechanical role has not been systematically investigated. Here, we demonstrate that mechanical constraints imposed by the midvein play a crucial role in generating the diverse morphologies that emerge during leaf drying. Combining numerical simulations and theoretical analysis, we show that a uniformly shrinking leaf lamina constrained by a non-shrinking midvein gives rise to two distinct types of configurations: curling-dominated and folding-dominated morphologies. In the curling-dominated regime, both S-curled and C-curled shapes emerge, with C-curled configurations more commonly observed due to their lower elastic energy. In contrast, the folding-dominated regime features folding accompanied by edge waviness. Theoretical modeling reveals a linear relationship between midvein curvature and mismatch strain, consistent with simulation results. Moreover, we find that the morphological outcome is governed by the ratio of bending stiffnesses between the lamina and the midvein. We construct a comprehensive phase diagram for the transitions between different configurations. These findings provide a mechanical framework for understanding shape formation in drying leaves, offering new insights into natural morphing processes and informing the design of bio-inspired morphable structures.

Title: Correlation-driven quantum geometry effects in a Kondo system
Authors: Ruizi Liu, Zehan Chen, Xingkai Cheng, Xiaolin Ren, Yiyang Zhang, Xuezhao Wu, Chengping Zhang, Kun Qian, Ching Ho Chan, Junwei Liu, Kam Tuen Law, Qiming Shao
Abstract: Quantum geometry, including quantum metric and Berry curvature, which describes the topology of electronic states, can induce fascinating physical properties. Symmetry-dependent nonlinear transport has emerged as a sensitive probe of these quantum geometric properties. However, its interplay with strong electronic correlations has rarely been explored in bulk materials, particularly in a Kondo lattice system. Here, we uncover correlation-driven quantum geometry in centrosymmetric antiferromagnetic iron telluride (FeTe). We experimentally observe the quantum metric quadrupole-induced third-order nonlinear transport, whose angular dependence reflects magnetic structure in FeTe. The nonlinear transport signals follow Kondo lattice crossover and vanish at high temperatures. Our theory suggests that a Kondo lattice formed at low temperatures explains the emergence of quantum geometry, which is induced by the opening of a hybridization gap near the Fermi energy. This discovery establishes a paradigm where quantum geometry arises not from static symmetry breaking but from dynamic many-body effects and provides a zero-field probe for sensing antiferromagnetic order.

Title: Tailoring hard magnetic properties of Fe2MnSn Heusler alloy via interstitial modification: A first-principles approach
Authors: Junaid Jami, Rohit Pathak, N. Venkataramani, K.G. Suresh, Amrita Bhattacharya
Abstract: We employ first-principles calculations to explore interstitial engineering as a strategy to tailor the hard magnetic properties of Fe2MnSn Heusler alloy, establishing its potential as a rare-earth-free permanent magnet. By introducing light interstitial elements -- B, C, H, N, O, and F -- at varying concentrations (1.56-12.5 at%), we uncover significant enhancements in structural stability, magnetization, Curie temperature, and magnetocrystalline anisotropy. These dopants preferentially occupy octahedral interstitial sites in the hexagonal phase of Fe2MnSn, leading to localized lattice distortions that enhance its magnetic characteristics. Notably, at 12.5 at% doping, B, C, N, and O induce a critical transition from in-plane to out-of-plane magnetic anisotropy -- achieved without 5d or rare-earth elements -- highlighting a sustainable pathway to high-performance magnets. Among these, N-doped Fe2MnSn exhibits the highest uniaxial anisotropy (0.61 MJ/m^3), followed by the B-doped (0.44 MJ/m^3) alloy. The magnetization of the doped compounds surpasses that of conventional ferrites and gap magnets like MnAl and MnBi. The Curie temperature sees a substantial boost, reaching 1058 K for O-doped Fe2MnSn and 1000 K for the C-doped alloy. Although N-doping results in a modest increase in Tc (744 K vs. 729 K for the pristine alloy), it delivers superior hard magnetic properties, with the highest magnetic hardness (0.65) and an enhanced maximum energy product (0.36 MJ/m^3), making it a strong candidate for gap magnet applications. These findings highlight interstitial doping as a viable route to engineer rare-earth-free permanent magnets with optimized magnetic performance.

Title: Wilson Line and Disorder Invariants of Topological One-Dimensional Multiband Models
Authors: R. Moola, A. Mckenna, M. Hilke
Abstract: Topological invariants, such as the winding number, the Chern number, and the Zak phase, characterize the topological phases of bulk materials. Through the bulk-boundary correspondence, these topological phases have a one-to-one correspondence to topological edge states, which are robust to certain classes of disorder. For simple models like the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) model, the computation of the winding number and Zak phase are straightforward, however, in multiband systems, this is no longer the case. In this work, we introduce the unwrapped Wilson line across the Brillouin zone to compute the bulk topological invariant. This method can efficiently be implemented numerically to evaluate multiband SSH-type models, including models that have a large number of distinct topological phases. This approach accurately captures all topological edge states, including those overlooked by traditional invariants, such as the winding number and Zak phase. To make a connection to experiments, we determine the sign of the topological invariant by considering a Hall-like configuration. We further introduce different classes of disorder that leave certain edge states protected, while suppressing other edge states, depending on their symmetry properties. Our approach is illustrated using different one-dimensional models, providing a robust framework for understanding topological properties in one-dimensional systems.

Title: Data-driven high-throughput search for the accelerated discovery of rare-earth-free permanent magnets
Authors: Junaid Jami, Nitish Bhagat, Amrita Bhattacharya
Abstract: An integrated data-driven approach combined with a high-throughput framework based on first-principles calculations was used to discover novel rare-earth-free permanent magnets, focusing on binary alloys. Compounds were screened systematically based on their elemental composition, structure, stability, and magnetization. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations were performed on the selected candidates to evaluate their magnetocrystalline anisotropy energy (MAE) and Curie temperature (Tc), resulting in the identification of ten promising materials. A thorough literature review was done to assess reports of prior existence, which confirmed the novelty of ZnFe and Fe8N. Their ferromagnetic ground state was re-established through DFT, and structural stability was confirmed via negative formation enthalpies, phonon spectra, and elastic criteria. Tetragonal ZnFe and Fe8N exhibit high saturation magnetization (>1 T), large anisotropy constants (>0.5 MJ/m^3), and high Tc (>1200 K). Their magnetic hardness parameters (kappa = 0.85 for ZnFe and 0.70 for Fe8N) further support their potential as gap magnets. These findings highlight the efficacy of our high-throughput screening, which may serve as a theoretical blueprint for the experimental realization of these materials.

Title: 1/ f noise and two-level systems in MBE-grown Al thin films

Abstract: Aluminum thin films are essential to the functionalities of electronic and quantum devices, where two-level systems (TLS) can degrade device performance. MBE-grown Al films may appeal to these applications due to their low TLS densities. We studied the energy distributions of TLS densities, g(E), in 10-nm-thick MBE-grown and electron-beam evaporated Al films through 1/f noise measurements between 80 and 360 K. At 300 K, the noise magnitudes in MBE-grown films are about three times lower than in the electron-beam evaporated films, corresponding to the g(E) values about ten times lower in the former than in the latter. Compared with previously established observations, we identified that the 1/f noise was generated by thermally activated TLS at grain boundaries.

Title: Investigating the Fermi-Hubbard model by the Tensor-Backflow method
Authors: Xiao Liang
Abstract: Recently, a variational wave-function based on the tensor representation of backflow corrections has achieved state-of-the-art energy precision in solving Fermi-Hubbard-type models. However, the Fermi-Hubbard model is very challenging to solve, and the validity of a method relies on investigating the ground state's physical property. For simplicity, we name the tensor representation of backflow corrections as the Tensor-Backflow in this work. We apply the Tensor-Backflow method to investigate the Fermi-Hubbard model on two-dimensional lattices as large as 256 sites, under various interaction strengths $U$, electron fillings $n$ and boundary conditions. Energy precision can be further improved by considering more backflow terms, such as considering backflow terms from next-nearest-neighbours or from all sites. Energy extrapolations on 64-site lattices give competitive results to the gradient optimized fPEPS with the bond dimension as large as $D$=20. For cases of $n$=0.875 and $U$=8 on the $16\times 16$ lattice under open boundary condition, by considering nearest-neighbour backflow terms, obtained energy is only $4.5\times 10^{-4}$ higher than the state-of-the-art method fPEPS with the bond dimension $D$=20. For periodic boundary condition, the variational wave-function is not enforced on any prior symmetry, meanwhile linear stripe order is successfully obtained. Under the same filling and $U$=10,12, energies obtained from initializations with the obtained wave-function for $U$=8 are lower than that from direct optimizations, meanwhile energies are competitive to or even better than state-of-the-art tensor network methods. For cases of $n$=0.8 and 0.9375, results consistent with the phase diagram from AFQMC are obtained by direct optimizations.

Title: STEM Diffraction Pattern Analysis with Deep Learning Networks
Authors: Sebastian Wissel, Jonas Scheunert, Aaron Dextre, Shamail Ahmed, Andreas Bayer, Kerstin Volz, Bai-Xiang Xu
Abstract: Accurate grain orientation mapping is essential for understanding and optimizing the performance of polycrystalline materials, particularly in energy-related applications. Lithium nickel oxide (LiNiO$_{2}$) is a promising cathode material for next-generation lithium-ion batteries, and its electrochemical behaviour is closely linked to microstructural features such as grain size and crystallographic orientations. Traditional orientation mapping methods--such as manual indexing, template matching (TM), or Hough transform-based techniques--are often slow and noise-sensitive when handling complex or overlapping patterns, creating a bottleneck in large-scale microstructural analysis. This work presents a machine learning-based approach for predicting Euler angles directly from scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM) diffraction patterns (DPs). This enables the automated generation of high-resolution crystal orientation maps, facilitating the analysis of internal microstructures at the nanoscale. Three deep learning architectures--convolutional neural networks (CNNs), Dense Convolutional Networks (DenseNets), and Shifted Windows (Swin) Transformers--are evaluated, using an experimentally acquired dataset labelled via a commercial TM algorithm. While the CNN model serves as a baseline, both DenseNets and Swin Transformers demonstrate superior performance, with the Swin Transformer achieving the highest evaluation scores and the most consistent microstructural predictions. The resulting crystal maps exhibit clear grain boundary delineation and coherent intra-grain orientation distributions, underscoring the potential of attention-based architectures for analyzing diffraction-based image data. These findings highlight the promise of combining advanced machine learning models with STEM data for robust, high-throughput microstructural characterization.

Title: Electron-phonon vertex correction effect in superconducting H3S
Authors: Shashi B. Mishra, Hitoshi Mori, Elena R. Margine
Abstract: The Migdal-Eliashberg (ME) formalism provides a reliable framework for describing phonon-mediated superconductivity in the adiabatic regime, where the electronic Fermi energy exceeds the characteristic phonon energy. In this work, we go beyond this limit by incorporating first-order vertex corrections to the electron-phonon (e-ph) interaction within the Eliashberg formalism and assess their impact on the superconducting properties of H3S and Pb using first-principles calculations. For H3S, where the adiabatic assumption breaks down, we find that vertex corrections to the e-ph coupling are substantial. When combined with phonon anharmonicity and the energy dependence of the electronic density of states, the predicted critical temperature (Tc) is in very good agreement with experimental observations. In contrast, for elemental Pb, where the adiabatic approximation remains valid, vertex corrections have a negligible effect, and the calculated Tc and superconducting gap closely match the predictions of the standard ME formalism. These findings demonstrate the importance of non-adiabatic corrections in strongly coupled high-Tc hydrides and establish a robust first-principles framework for accurately predicting superconducting properties across different regimes.

Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for 3He and 4He is considered on the basis of the Schrödinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.

Title: On the influence of reference sample properties on magnetic force microscopy calibrations
Authors: Baha Sakar, Christopher Habenschaden, Sibylle Sievers, Hans Werner Schumacher
Abstract: Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) allows the characterization of magnetic stray field distributions with high sensitivity and spatial resolution. Based on a suitable calibration procedure, MFM can also yield quantitative magnetic field values. This process typically involves measuring a reference sample to determine the distribution of the tip's stray field or stray field gradient at the sample surface. This distribution is called the tip transfer function (TTF) and is derived through regularized deconvolution in Fourier space. The properties of the reference sample and the noise characteristics of the detection system significantly influence the derived TTF, thereby limiting its validity range. In a recent study, the tip stray field distribution, and hence the TTF, of an MFM tip was independently measured in real space using a nitrogen vacancy center as a quantum sensor, revealing considerable discrepancies with the reference-sample-based TTF. Here, we analyze the influence of the feature distribution of the reference sample and the MFM measurement parameters on the resulting TTF. We explain the observed differences between quantum-calibrated stray field distributions and the classical approach by attributing them to a loss of information due to missing or suppressed spectral components. Furthermore, we emphasize the importance of the spectral coverage of the TTF. Our findings indicate that for high-quality reconstruction of the stray field of a sample under test (SUT), it is more critical to ensure a strong overlap of frequency components between the reference sample and the SUT than to achieve an accurate real-space reconstruction of the tip stray field distribution.

Title: Advancing Magnetic Materials Discovery -- A structure-based machine learning approach for magnetic ordering and magnetic moment prediction
Authors: Apoorv Verma, Junaid Jami, Amrita Bhattacharya
Abstract: Accurately predicting magnetic behavior across diverse materials systems remains a longstanding challenge due to the complex interplay of structural and electronic factors and is pivotal for the accelerated discovery and design of next-generation magnetic materials. In this work, a refined descriptor is proposed that significantly improves the prediction of two critical magnetic properties -- magnetic ordering (Ferromagnetic vs. Ferrimagnetic) and magnetic moment per atom -- using only the structural information of materials. Unlike previous models limited to Mn-based or lanthanide-transition metal compounds, the present approach generalizes across a diverse dataset of 5741 stable, binary and ternary, ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic compounds sourced from the Materials Project. Leveraging an enriched elemental vector representation and advanced feature engineering, including nonlinear terms and reduced matrix sparsity, the LightGBM-based model achieves an accuracy of 82.4% for magnetic ordering classification and balanced recall across FM and FiM classes, addressing a key limitation in prior studies. The model predicts magnetic moment per atom with a correlation coefficient of 0.93, surpassing the Hund's matrix and orbital field matrix descriptors. Additionally, it accurately estimates formation energy per atom, enabling assessment of both magnetic behavior and material stability. This generalized and computationally efficient framework offers a robust tool for high-throughput screening of magnetic materials with tailored properties.

Title: Photoelastic Grain Solver v2.0: An updated tool for analysis of force measurements in granular materials
Authors: Carmen L. Lee, Lori McCabe, Ben McMillan, Abrar Naseer, Dong Xie, Ted Brzinski, Karen E. Daniels, Tejas Murthy, Kerstin Nordstrom
Abstract: Photoelastic force imaging is an experimental technique whereby a birefringent granular material is imaged with a polariscope to characterize the internal stress state of a granular material. Photoelasticimetry is the only proven experimental technique that allows researchers to measure the shear and normal forces at every particle contact in a granular packing. In 2017, Kollmer et al. [Rev. Sci. Instrum. 88, 051808 (2017)] developed an open-source software to perform this analysis. Here, we present the next substantial update to this software package. The new version improves resolution and efficiency and substantially changes the software architecture. The structural changes better facilitate add-ons, modules, and future improvements to the performance, accessibility, and versatility of the tool. Besides updates to the core software, we introduce new infrastructure to support the ongoing development of software, documentation, and training materials.

Title: Extrinsic Orbital Hall Effect and Orbital Relaxation in Mesoscopic Devices
Authors: Anderson L. R. Barbosa, Hyun-Woo Lee, Tatiana G. Rappoport
Abstract: Despite recent advances in orbitronics, the influence of disorder on the orbital Hall effect and orbital relaxation mechanisms remains poorly understood. In this work, we numerically investigate the role of disorder in orbital transport within mesoscopic devices using a real-space tight-binding model on a two-dimensional square lattice that hosts atomic orbitals capable of carrying atomic orbital angular momentum. By considering devices with varying geometries--square and rectangular--and systematically tuning disorder strength, we examine the disorder effect on orbital Hall current (OHC) generation, and orbital relaxation. Our results reveal a strong dependence of the OHC and orbital Hall angle on disorder strength. In square devices, we demonstrate that the orbital Hall response can be strongly enhanced by disorder and its dependence on the disorder strength indicates the dominance of skew-scattering mechanism in the diffusive regime. In rectangular geometries, the orbital current decays exponentially with increasing device width, from which the orbital relaxation length is extracted. These findings provide critical insights into disorder-driven orbital transport phenomena and lay the foundation for designing next-generation orbitronic devices.

Title: Stabilization of long-range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium $O(N)$ models
Authors: Oriana K. Diessel, Jaewon Kim, Ehud Altman
Abstract: It is now well established that the Mermin-Wagner theorem can be circumvented in nonequilibrium systems, allowing for the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry and the emergence of long-range order in low dimensions. However, only a few models demonstrating this violation are known, and they often rely on specific mechanisms that may not be generally applicable. In this work, we identify a new mechanism for nonequilibrium-induced long-range order in a class of $O(N)$-symmetric models. Inspired by the role of long-range spatial interactions in equilibrium, consider the effect of non-Markovian dissipation, in stabilizing long range order in low-dimensional nonequilibrium systems. We find that this alone is insufficient, but the interplay of non-Markovian dissipation and slow modes due to conservation laws can effectively suppress fluctuations and stabilize long-range order.

Title: XxaCT-NN: Structure Agnostic Multimodal Learning for Materials Science
Authors: Jithendaraa Subramanian, Linda Hung, Daniel Schweigert, Santosh Suram, Weike Ye
Abstract: Recent advances in materials discovery have been driven by structure-based models, particularly those using crystal graphs. While effective for computational datasets, these models are impractical for real-world applications where atomic structures are often unknown or difficult to obtain. We propose a scalable multimodal framework that learns directly from elemental composition and X-ray diffraction (XRD) -- two of the more available modalities in experimental workflows without requiring crystal structure input. Our architecture integrates modality-specific encoders with a cross-attention fusion module and is trained on the 5-million-sample Alexandria dataset. We present masked XRD modeling (MXM), and apply MXM and contrastive alignment as self-supervised pretraining strategies. Pretraining yields faster convergence (up to 4.2x speedup) and improves both accuracy and representation quality. We further demonstrate that multimodal performance scales more favorably with dataset size than unimodal baselines, with gains compounding at larger data regimes. Our results establish a path toward structure-free, experimentally grounded foundation models for materials science.

Title: Functional Renormalization for Signal Detection: Dimensional Analysis and Dimensional Phase Transition for Nearly Continuous Spectra Effective Field Theory
Authors: Riccardo Finotello, Vincent Lahoche, Dine Ousmane Samary
Abstract: Signal detection is one of the main challenges of data science. According to the nature of the data, the presence of noise may corrupt measurements and hinder the discovery of significant patterns. A wide range of techniques aiming at extracting the relevant degrees of freedom from data has been thus developed over the years. However, signal detection in almost continuous spectra, for small signal-to-noise ratios, remains a known difficult issue. This paper develops over recent advancements proposing to tackle this issue by analysing the properties of the underlying effective field theory arising as a sort of maximal entropy distribution in the vicinity of universal random matrix distributions. Nearly continuous spectra provide an intrinsic and non-conventional scaling law for field and couplings, the scaling dimensions depending on the energy scale. The coarse-graining over small eigenvalues of the empirical spectrum defines a specific renormalization group, whose characteristics change when the collective behaviour of "informational" modes become significant, that is, stronger than the intrinsic fluctuations of noise. This paper pursues three different goals. First, we propose to quantify the real effects of fluctuations relative to what can be called "signal", while improving the robustness of the results obtained in our previous work. Second, we show that quantitative changes in the presence of a signal result in a counterintuitive modification of the distribution of eigenvectors. Finally, we propose a method for estimating the number of noise components and define a limit of detection in a general nearly continuous spectrum using the renormalization group. The main statements of this paper are essentially numeric, and their reproducibility can be checked using the associated code.

Title: Orthotropic Viscoelastic Creep in Cellular Scaffolds
Authors: Alessia Ferrara, Falk K. Wittel
Abstract: Recent measurements of Norway spruce have revealed stress-state-dependent normalized creep behavior, highlighting a gap in our fundamental understanding. This study examines whether the anisotropic response originates from the micro-structural, cellular nature of composite cell walls with varying tracheid types. Cell wall creep parameters are identified via surrogate-based inverse parameter identification, applied to hierarchical micro-mechanical and FEM models of increasing topological complexity up to the growth ring scale. Despite microstructural disorder, simulated creep curves converge toward a universal set of proportionality factors. The results indicate that directional creep behavior cannot be attributed solely to tissue-scale topology, and that realistic predictions require the inclusion of non-linear material responses at stress concentration sites.

Title: Proof of a perfect platonic representation hypothesis
Authors: Liu Ziyin, Isaac Chuang
Abstract: In this note, we elaborate on and explain in detail the proof given by Ziyin et al. (2025) of the "perfect" Platonic Representation Hypothesis (PRH) for the embedded deep linear network model (EDLN). We show that if trained with SGD, two EDLNs with different widths and depths and trained on different data will become Perfectly Platonic, meaning that every possible pair of layers will learn the same representation up to a rotation. Because most of the global minima of the loss function are not Platonic, that SGD only finds the perfectly Platonic solution is rather extraordinary. The proof also suggests at least six ways the PRH can be broken. We also show that in the EDLN model, the emergence of the Platonic representations is due to the same reason as the emergence of progressive sharpening. This implies that these two seemingly unrelated phenomena in deep learning can, surprisingly, have a common cause. Overall, the theory and proof highlight the importance of understanding emergent "entropic forces" due to the irreversibility of SGD training and their role in representation learning. The goal of this note is to be instructive and avoid lengthy technical details.

Title: Gauging Non-Invertible Symmetries in (2+1)d Topological Orders
Authors: Mahesh K. N. Balasubramanian, Matthew Buican, Clement Delcamp, Rajath Radhakrishnan
Abstract: We present practical and formal methods for gauging non-invertible symmetries in (2+1)d topological quantum field theories. Along the way, we generalize various aspects of invertible 0-form gauging, including symmetry fractionalization, discrete torsion, and the fixed point theorem for symmetry action on lines. Our approach involves two complementary strands: the fusion of topological interfaces and Morita theory of fusion 2-categories. We use these methods to derive constraints on gaugeable symmetries and their duals while unifying the prescription for gauging non-invertible 0-form and 1-form symmetries and various higher structures. With a view toward recent advances in creating non-Abelian topological orders from Abelian ones, we give a simple recipe for non-invertible 0-form gauging that takes large classes of the latter to the former. We also describe conditions under which iterated gauging of invertible 0-form symmetries is equivalent to a single-step gauging of a non-invertible symmetry. We conclude with a set of concrete examples illustrating these various phenomena involving gauging symmetries of the infrared limit of the toric code.

Title: Temperature and Magnetic-Field Dependence of Energy Relaxation in a Fluxonium Qubit

Abstract: Noise from material defects at device interfaces is known to limit the coherence of superconducting circuits, yet our understanding of the defect origins and noise mechanisms remains incomplete. Here we investigate the temperature and in-plane magnetic-field dependence of energy relaxation in a low-frequency fluxonium qubit, where the sensitivity to flux noise and charge noise arising from dielectric loss can be tuned by applied flux. We observe an approximately linear scaling of flux noise with temperature $T$ and a power-law dependence of dielectric loss $T^3$ up to 100 mK. Additionally, we find that the dielectric-loss-limited $T_1$ decreases with weak in-plane magnetic fields, suggesting a potential magnetic-field response of the underlying charge-coupled defects. We implement a multi-level decoherence model in our analysis, motivated by the widely tunable matrix elements and transition energies approaching the thermal energy scale in our system. These findings offer insight for fluxonium coherence modeling and should inform microscopic theories of intrinsic noise in superconducting circuits.

Title: Harnessing coherent-wave control for sensing applications
Authors: Pablo Jara, Arthur Goetschy, Hui Cao, Alexey Yamilov
Abstract: Imaging techniques such as functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) and diffuse optical tomography (DOT) achieve deep, non-invasive sensing in turbid media, but they are constrained by the photon budget. Wavefront shaping (WFS) can enhance signal strength via interference at specific locations within scattering media, enhancing light-matter interactions and potentially extending the penetration depth of these techniques. Interpreting the resulting measurements rests on the knowledge of optical sensitivity - a relationship between detected signal changes and perturbations at a specific location inside the medium. However, conventional diffusion-based sensitivity models rely on assumptions that become invalid under coherent illumination. In this work, we develop a microscopic theory for optical sensitivity that captures the inherent interference effects that diffusion theory necessarily neglects. We analytically show that under random illumination, the microscopic and diffusive treatments coincide. Using our microscopic approach, we explore WFS strategies for enhancing optical sensitivity beyond the diffusive result. We demonstrate that the input state obtained through phase conjugation at a given point inside the system leads to the largest enhancement of optical sensitivity but requires an input wavefront that depends on the target position. In sharp contrast, the maximum remission eigenchannel leads to a global enhancement of the sensitivity map with a fixed input wavefront. This global enhancement equals to remission enhancement and preserves the spatial distribution of the sensitivity, making it compatible with existing DOT reconstruction algorithms. Our results establish the theoretical foundation for integrating wavefront control with diffuse optical imaging, enabling deeper tissue penetration through improved signal strength in biomedical applications.

Title: Mixed five-point correlators in the 3d Ising model
Authors: David Poland, Valentina Prilepina, Petar Tadić
Abstract: We study five-point correlators of the $\sigma$, $\epsilon$, and $\epsilon'$ operators in the critical 3d Ising model. We consider the $\sigma \times \sigma$ and $\sigma \times \epsilon$ operator product expansions (OPEs) and truncate them by including a finite set of exchanged operators. We approximate the truncated operators by the corresponding contributions in appropriate disconnected five-point correlators. We compute a number of OPE coefficients that were previously unknown and show that these are consistent with predictions obtained using the fuzzy sphere regularization of the critical 3d Ising model.

Title: Passive Quantum Interconnects: High-Fidelity Quantum Networking at Higher Rates and Less Overhead
Authors: Seigo Kikura, Kazufumi Tanji, Akihisa Goban, Shinichi Sunami
Abstract: High-fidelity, high-rate quantum interconnect is a fundamental building block of scalable quantum technologies. The cavity-assisted photon scattering (CAPS) approach is an attractive alternative to commonly used active protocols based on photon emission and two-photon interference: it offers higher success probability and greater intrinsic robustness to imperfections, while remaining a passive operation that does not require complex atom excitation sequences or intermodule synchronization. Despite these advantages, CAPS has not been a primary choice for quantum interconnect protocols since the estimated fidelity and the rate of CAPS-based networking have been severely limited in existing protocols and analysis frameworks. In this work, we eliminate these limitations by protocol improvements aided by a thorough analysis of the atom-cavity dynamics, to demonstrate that existing or near-term optical cavity qualities are sufficient for achieving a fidelity of 0.999 with short optical pulses required for high-rate networking. We show that efficient time-multiplexed operation is possible with suppressed crosstalk, enabling high-rate entanglement generation. We also propose a hybrid network configuration leveraging both photon emission and CAPS gates, eliminating the need for external photon sources while maintaining performance and robustness. As a concrete example, with 200 ${}^{171}$Yb atoms coupled to a cavity with internal cooperativity 100, atom-atom entanglement generation rate of $4 \times 10^5~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ is estimated at a fidelity of 0.999, with further speedup beyond $10^6~\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ anticipated by the use of multiple wavelength channels. Our results establish the CAPS-based network protocol as a leading candidate for scaling quantum information platforms.

Title: Fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with the guaranteed H-theorem
Authors: Aoto Takahashi, Shigeru Takata
Abstract: The fluid-dynamic limit of the Enskog equation with a slight modification is discussed on the basis of the Chapman-Enskog method. This modified version of the Enskog equation has been shown recently by the present authors to ensure the H-theorem. In the present paper, it is shown that the modified version recovers the same fluid-dynamic description of the dense gas as the original Enskog equation, at least up to the level of the Navier-Stokes-Fourier set of equations inclusive. Since the original Enskog equation is known to recover the fluid-dynamical transport properties well, this result implies that the modified version of the Enskog equation provides consistent descriptions both thermodynamically and fluid-dynamically.

Title: Weak Hopf tube algebra for domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro TQFTs
Authors: Zhian Jia, Sheng Tan
Abstract: We investigate domain walls between 2d gapped phases of Turaev-Viro type topological quantum field theories (TQFTs) by constructing domain wall tube algebras. We begin by analyzing the domain wall tube algebra associated with bimodule categories, and then extend the construction to multimodule categories over $N$ base fusion categories. We prove that the resulting tube algebra is naturally equipped with a $C^*$ weak Hopf algebra structure. We show that topological excitations localized on domain walls are classified by representations of the corresponding domain wall tube algebra, in the sense that the functor category of bimodules admits a fusion-preserving embedding into the representation category of the domain wall tube algebra. We further establish the folding trick and Morita theory in this context. Then, most crucially, we provide a rigorous construction of the Drinfeld quantum double from weak Hopf boundary tube algebras using a skew-pairing, and establish an isomorphism between domain wall tube algebra and Drinfeld quantum double of boundary tube algebras. Motivated by the correspondence between the domain wall tube algebra and the quantum double of the boundary tube algebras, we introduce the notion of an $N$-tuple algebra and demonstrate how it arises in the multimodule domain wall setting. Finally, we consider defects between two domain walls, showing that such defects can be characterized by representations of a domain wall defect tube algebra. We briefly outline how these defects can be systematically treated within this representation-theoretic framework.

Abstract: The QSSEP, short for quantum symmetric simple exclusion process, is a paradigm model for stochastic quantum dynamics. Averaging over the noise, the quantum dynamics reduce to the well-studied SSEP (symmetric simple exclusion process). These notes provide an introduction to quantum exclusion processes, focusing on the example of QSSEP and its connection to free probability, with an emphasis on mathematical aspects.

Title: Many-Body Fluctuation Theorems for Quantum Coherence and Correlation Dynamics
Authors: Kun Zhang, Mo-Yang Ni, Hai-Long Shi, Xiao-Hui Wang, Jin Wang
Abstract: Fluctuation theorems establish exact relations for nonequilibrium dynamics, profoundly advancing the field of stochastic thermodynamics. In this Letter, we extend quantum fluctuation theorems beyond the traditional thermodynamic framework to quantum information dynamics and many-body systems, where both the system and the environment are multipartite without assuming any thermodynamic constraints. Based on the two-point measurement scheme and the classical probability, we establish the fluctuation theorem for the dynamics of many-body classical mutual information. By extending to quasiprobability, we derive quantum fluctuation theorems for many-body coherence and quantum correlations, presenting them in both integral and detailed forms. Our theoretical results are illustrated and verified using three-qubit examples, and feasible experimental verification protocols are proposed. These findings uncover the statistical structure underlying the nonequilibrium quantum information dynamics, providing fundamental insights and new tools for advancing quantum technologies.

Title: Magnetism from Conductors, and Enhanced Non-Linear Phenomena
Authors: JB Pendry, AJ Holden, DJ Robbins, WJ Stewart
Abstract: We show that microstructures built from non-magnetic conducting sheets exhibit an effective magnetic permeability, /mu_meff, which can be tuned to values not accessible in naturally occurring materials, including large imaginary components of /mu_meff. The microstructure is on a scale much less than the wavelength of radiation, is not resolved by incident microwaves, and uses a very low density of metal so that structures can be extremely lightweight. Most of the structures are resonant due to internal capacitance and inductance, and resonant enhancement combined with compression of electrical energy into a very small volume greatly enhances the energy density at critical locations in the structure, easily by factors of a million and possibly by much more. Weakly non-linear materials placed at these critical locations will show greatly enhanced effects raising the possibility of manufacturing active structures whose properties can be switched at will between many states

Title: The impact of process steps on nearly ideal subthreshold slope in 300-mm compatible InGaZnO TFT
Authors: Hongwei Tang, Dennis Lin, Subhali Subhechha, Adrian Chasin, Daisuke Matsubayashi, Michiel van Setten, Yiqun Wan, Harold Dekkers, Jie Li, Shruthi Subramanian, Zhuo Chen, Nouredine Rassoul, Yuchao Jiang, Jan Van Houdt, Valeri Afanas`ev, Gouri Sankar Kar, Attilio Belmonte
Abstract: While we demonstrate a back-gated (BG) amorphous Indium-Gallium-Zinc-Oxide (a-IGZO) transistors with a nearly ideal subthreshold slope (SS) ~ 60 mV/dec. However, SS degrades when a top-gated (TG) configuration is implemented. The energy distribution of traps inferred from temperature-dependent (T = 4 K - 300 K) and multi-frequency (f = 1 kHz - 100 kHz) admittance measurements, reveals a much higher trap density in TG devices. By analyzing the impact of each process step and conducting forming gas anneal (FGA) experiments, we reveal the role of hydrogen in the deterioration of the SS in the IGZO-based transistors.

Title: String Breaking Dynamics and Glueball Formation in a $2+1$D Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Kaidi Xu, Umberto Borla, Sergej Moroz, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: With the advent of advanced quantum processors capable of probing lattice gauge theories (LGTs) in higher spatial dimensions, it is crucial to understand string dynamics in such models to guide upcoming experiments and to make connections to high-energy physics (HEP). Using tensor network methods, we study the far-from-equilibrium quench dynamics of electric flux strings between two static charges in the $2+1$D $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT with dynamical matter. We calculate the probabilities of finding the time-evolved wave function in string configurations of the same length as the initial string. At resonances determined by the the electric field strength and the mass, we identify various string breaking processes accompanied with matter creation. Away from resonance strings exhibit intriguing confined dynamics which, for strong electric fields, we fully characterize through effective perturbative models. Starting in maximal-length strings, we find that the wave function enters a dynamical regime where it splits into shorter strings and disconnected loops, with the latter bearing qualitative resemblance to glueballs in quantum chromodynamics (QCD). Our findings can be probed on state-of-the-art superconducting-qubit and trapped-ion quantum processors.

Title: Emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry in the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma chain with a Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction
Authors: Wang Yang, Alberto Nocera, Chao Xu, Shicheng Ma, Arnab Adhikary, Ian Affleck
Abstract: We study the one-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma model with a bond-dependent Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction, which can be induced by an electric field applied in the third direction where the first and second directions refer to the two bond directions in the model. By a combination of field theory and symmetry analysis, an extended gapless phase with an emergent SU(2)$_1$ conformal symmetry is found in the phase diagram of the spin-1/2 Kitaev-Gamma-DM chain. The analytic predictions are in good agreements with numerical results obtained from density matrix renormalization group simulations.

Title: Empowering deep neural quantum states through efficient optimization
Authors: Ao Chen, Markus Heyl
Abstract: Computing the ground state of interacting quantum matter is a long-standing challenge, especially for complex two-dimensional systems. Recent developments have highlighted the potential of neural quantum states to solve the quantum many-body problem by encoding the many-body wavefunction into artificial neural networks. However, this method has faced the critical limitation that existing optimization algorithms are not suitable for training modern large-scale deep network architectures. Here, we introduce a minimum-step stochastic-reconfiguration optimization algorithm, which allows us to train deep neural quantum states with up to $10^6$ parameters. We demonstrate our method for paradigmatic frustrated spin-1/2 models on square and triangular lattices, for which our trained deep networks approach machine precision and yield improved variational energies compared to existing results. Equipped with our optimization algorithm, we find numerical evidence for gapless quantum-spin-liquid phases in the considered models, an open question to date. We present a method that captures the emergent complexity in quantum many-body problems through the expressive power of large-scale artificial neural networks.

Title: A Replica-BCS theory for dirty superconductors
Authors: Yat Fan Lau, Tai Kai Ng
Abstract: In this paper, we revisit the problem of dirty superconductors using a replica-symmetric BCS (RS-BCS) theory. We apply the RS-BCS theory to dirty superconductor grains of size $L^d$, where $L$ is the localization length and $d$ is the dimension of the system, assuming that the macroscopic system is composed of weakly coupled grains. Besides disordered potential, We also consider the case where regions with opposite signs of interaction exist in the grains, with net attractive interaction between electrons. Within the RS-BCS mean field theory, the system phase diagram, single-particle tunneling density of states and the superfluid density are computed within the RS-BCS theory for different strengths of disorder, We show that our result agrees qualitatively with previous numerical studies in the case with pure attractive interaction, and that a Cooper-pair-glass state may exist when regions with opposite sign of interaction exists and the net interaction between electrons is close to zero. The plausible relevance of our result to the anomalous metal state is discussed.

Title: Temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties of CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 by first-principles calculations
Authors: Shuang Lin, Shun-Li Shang, Allison M. Beese, Zi-Kui Liu
Abstract: In the present work, the density functional theory (DFT) in the generalized-gradient approximation developed by Perdew, Burke, and Ernzerhof (PBE) +U method, i.e., PBE+U, was employed to predict temperature-dependent thermodynamic properties of the rutile-type oxides CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 as well as the binary oxides Cr2O3, Nb2O5, and Ta2O5 via the quasiharmonic phonon approach (QHA). Calculated thermodynamic properties of the binary oxides were benchmarked with experimental data, showing high accuracy except for the negative thermal expansion (NTE) of Nb2O5, attributed to its polymorphic complexity. By combining the formation energy predicted by DFT with the existing SGTE Substances Database (SSUB5), the CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 are found to be thermodynamic stable up to 1706 K and 1926 K and decompose into Cr2O3 and Nb2O5 or Ta2O5 at those temperatures, respectively. The temperature dependence of linear thermal expansion coefficients for CrNbO4 and CrTaO4 are predicted, and their mean values from 500 K to 2000 K are found to be 6.0*10-6/K and 5.04*10-6/K, respectively, in agreement with experimental observations in the literature. The gas-phase species and their vapor pressure are calculated, indicating that the formation of CrTaO4 and CrNbO4 reduces chromium volatilization, which is critically important to design enhanced Refractory high entropy alloys (RHEAs) with enhanced oxidation resistance.

Title: Interaction induced moiré systems in twisted bilayer optical lattices
Authors: Jian-Hua Zeng, Qizhong Zhu, Liang He
Abstract: Moiré related physics in twisted bilayer two-dimensional (2D) materials has attracted widespread interest in condensed matter physics. Simulation of moiré related physics in cold atom platform is expected to outperform the 2D materials thanks to its advantage of higher tunablility. Here, we demonstrate that, the cold atom platform enables a new mechanism of moiré lattice formation, induced by interlayer interaction with intrinsic "dynamical" character, in contrast to conventional moiré lattice induced by "static" ways such as single-particle interlayer tunneling. Specifically, we consider a twisted bilayer Bose-Hubbard model with vanishing interlayer tunneling, and the bilayer is solely coupled through interlayer interaction that originates from contact interaction of atoms. We find that this system hosts a plethora of novel phases unique to this dynamical lattice, including a variety of Mott insulator (MI) and superfluid (SF) phases either preserving or breaking moiré lattice symmetry, phases with one layer in SF and the other in MI, "interlocked" MI, and self-localized phases at commensurate twist angles, which exhibits the characteristics of Bose glass and quasi-many-body localization in the absence of (quasi)disorder or quasicrystalline lattices. Our prediction can be readily observed in current experimental setup of twisted bilayer optical lattices, opening up new avenues for exploring the rich physics of interaction induced moiré systems in cold atoms.

Title: Optimal time estimation and the clock uncertainty relation for stochastic processes
Authors: Kacper Prech, Gabriel T. Landi, Florian Meier, Nuriya Nurgalieva, Patrick P. Potts, Ralph Silva, Mark T. Mitchison
Abstract: Time estimation is a fundamental task that underpins precision measurement, global navigation systems, financial markets, and the organisation of everyday life. Many biological processes also depend on time estimation by nanoscale clocks, whose performance can be significantly impacted by random fluctuations. In this work, we formulate the problem of optimal time estimation for Markovian stochastic processes, and present its general solution in the asymptotic (long-time) limit. Specifically, we obtain a tight upper bound on the precision of any time estimate constructed from sustained observations of a classical, Markovian jump process. This bound is controlled by the mean residual time, i.e. the expected wait before the first jump is observed. As a consequence, we obtain a universal bound on the signal-to-noise ratio of arbitrary currents and counting observables in the steady state. This bound is similar in spirit to the kinetic uncertainty relation but provably tighter, and we explicitly construct the counting observables that saturate it. Our results establish ultimate precision limits for an important class of observables in non-equilibrium systems, and demonstrate that the mean residual time, not the dynamical activity, is the measure of freneticity that tightly constrains fluctuations far from equilibrium.

Title: A universal black-box quantum Monte Carlo approach to quantum phase transitions
Authors: Nic Ezzell, Lev Barash, Itay Hen
Abstract: We derive exact, universal, closed-form quantum Monte Carlo estimators for finite-temperature energy susceptibility and fidelity susceptibility, applicable to essentially arbitrary Hamiltonians. Combined with recent advancements in Monte Carlo, our approach enables a black-box framework for studying quantum phase transitions--without requiring prior knowledge of an order parameter or the manual design of model-specific ergodic quantum Monte Carlo update rules. We demonstrate the utility of our method by applying a single implementation to the transverse-field Ising model, the XXZ model, and an ensemble of models related by random unitaries.

Title: Kolmogorov turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates
Authors: Mingshu Zhao, Junheng Tao, Ian Spielman
Abstract: We investigated turbulence in atomic Bose-Einstein condensates (BECs) using a minimally destructive, impurity injection technique analogous to particle image velocimetry in conventional fluids. Our approach transfers small regions of the BEC into a different hyperfine state, and tracks their displacement ultimately yielding the velocity field. This allows us to quantify turbulence in the same way as conventional in fluid dynamics in terms of velocity-velocity correlation functions called velocity structure functions that obey a Kolmogorov scaling law. Furthermore the velocity increments show a clear fat-tail non-Gaussian distribution that results from intermittency corrections to the initial "K41" Kolmogorov theory. Our observations are fully consistent with the later "KO62" description. These results are validated by a 2D dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii simulation.

Title: Fingerprint of Non-Hermiticity in d-wave Altermagnet
Authors: Gaurab Kumar Dash, Subhasis Panda, Snehasish Nandy
Abstract: We develop the non-Hermitian counterpart of a new class of collinear magnets, dubbed altermagnets, delineated by net zero magnetization with momentum-dependent spin-splitting bands. The application of an imaginary gauge field in a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet injects a non-reciprocal intercell hopping without hosting exceptional points (EPs). This non-Hermitian phase hosts a point gap which remains robust in the presence and absence of Rashba spin-orbit coupling. By attaching a ferromagnetic lead with the altermagnet, we uncover the emergence of two pairs of second-order EPs. We establish that each of the EPs is associated with a half-integer quantized topological charge, a hallmark signature of the non-Hermitian topology. The existence of this non-Hermitian exceptional phase has been further confirmed by linear variation with the respective momentum and coalescence of the spin expectation value at the EPs. Finally, we demonstrate that the application of a planar magnetic field to the junction not only tunes the location of the EPs but also can annihilate a single pair or even all pairs of EPs with opposite topological charges depending upon the field strength and direction.

Title: A Theory of Anisotropic Magnetoresistance in Altermagnets and Its Applications
Authors: Xian-Peng Zhang, Run-Wu Zhang, Xiaolong Fan, Wanxiang Feng, Xiangrong Wang, Yugui Yao
Abstract: Altermagnets, a newly discovered class of magnets, integrate the advantages of both ferromagnets and antiferromagnets, such as enabling anomalous transport without stray fields and supporting ultrafast spin dynamics, offering exciting opportunities for spintronics. A key challenge in altermagnetic spintronics is the efficient reading and writing of information by switching the Neel vector orientations to represent binary 0 and 1. Here, we develop a microscopic theory of the magnetoresistance effect in altermagnets and propose that magnetoresistance anisotropy can serve as an effective mechanism for the electrical readout of the Neel vector. Our theory describes a two-step charge-spin-charge conversion process governed by the interplay between spin splitting and spin Hall effects: a longitudinal electric field induces transverse drift spin currents, which induce significant spin accumulation at the boundaries, generating a diffusive spin current that is converted back into a longitudinal charge current. By switching the Neel vector, a substantial change in magnetoresistance, akin to giant magnetoresistance in ferromagnets, is realized, enabling an electrically readable altermagnetic memory. Our microscopic theory provides deeper insights into the fundamental physics of the magnetoresistance effect in altermagnets and offers valuable guidance for designing next-generation ultradense and ultrafast spintronic devices based on altermagnetism.

Title: Decoherence and wavefunction deformation of $D_4$ non-Abelian topological order
Authors: Pablo Sala, Jason Alicea, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: The effect of decoherence on topological order (TO) has been most deeply understood for the toric code, the paragon of Abelian TOs. We show that certain non-Abelian TOs can be analyzed and understood to a similar degree, despite being significantly richer. We consider both wavefunction deformations and quantum channels acting on $D_4$ TO, which has recently been realized on a quantum processor. By identifying the corresponding local statistical mechanical spin or rotor model with $D_4$ symmetry, we find a remarkable stability against proliferating non-Abelian anyons. This is shown by leveraging a reformulation in terms of the tractable O$(2)$ loop model in the pure state case, and $n$ coupled O$(2)$ loop models for Rényi-$n$ quantities in the decoherence case -- corresponding to worldlines of the proliferating anyon with quantum dimension $2$. In particular, we find that the purity ($n=2$) remains deep in the $D_4$ TO for any decoherence strength, while the $n \to \infty$ limit becomes critical upon maximally decohering a particular anyon type, similar to our wavefunction deformation result. The information-theoretic threshold ($n\to 1$) appears to be controlled by a disordered version of these stat-mech models, akin to the toric code case although significantly more robust. We furthermore use Monte Carlo simulations to explore the phase diagrams when multiple anyon types proliferate at the same time, leading to a continued stability of the $D_4$ TO in addition to critical phases with emergent $U(1)$ symmetry. Instead of loop models, these are now described by net models corresponding to different anyon types coupled together according to fusion this http URL opens up the exploration of statistical mechanical models for decohered non-Abelian TO, which can inform optimal decoders, and which in an ungauged formulation examples of non-Abelian strong-to-weak symmetry breaking.

Title: Self-sustained patchy turbulence in shear-thinning active fluids
Authors: Henning Reinken, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: Bacterial suspensions and other active fluids are known to develop highly dynamical vortex states, denoted as active or mesoscale turbulence. We reveal the pronounced effect of non-Newtonian rheological conditions on these turbulent states, concentrating on shear thinning. A self-sustained heterogeneous state of coexisting turbulent and quiescent areas develops, which results in anomalous velocity statistics. The heterogeneous state emerges in a hysteretic transition when varying activity. We provide an extensive numerical analysis and observe features consistent with a directed percolation transition. Our results are important, for instance, when addressing active objects in biological media with complex rheological properties.

Title: Gapless superconductivity and its real-space topology in quasicrystals
Authors: Kazuma Saito, Masahiro Hori, Ryo Okugawa, K. Tanaka, Takami Tohyama
Abstract: We study superconductivity in Ammann-Beenker quasicrystals under magnetic field. By assuming an intrinsic $s$-wave pairing interaction and solving for mean-field equations self-consistently, we find gapless superconductivity in the quasicrystals at and near half filling. We show that gapless superconductivity originates in broken translational symmetry and confined states unique to the quasicrystals. When Rashba spin-orbit coupling is present, the quasicrystalline gapless superconductor can be topologically nontrivial and characterized by a nonzero pseudospectrum invariant given by a spectral localizer. The gapless topological superconducting phase exhibits edge states with near-zero energy. These findings suggest that quasicrystals can be a unique platform for realizing gapless superconductivity with nontrivial topology.

Title: Asymmetry-induced radiative heat transfer in Floquet systems
Authors: Hui Pan, Yuhua Ren, Gaomin Tang, Jian-Sheng Wang
Abstract: Time modulation opens new avenues for light, heat control, and energy harvesting, yet the impact of nonequilibrium dynamics of microscopic particles remains largely unexplored. We develop a microscopic theory to describe radiative heat transfer in such Floquet systems. Significant heat transfer occurs due to differences in electronic properties between parallel metal plates, despite identical driving protocols and temperatures. This arises from a unique exponential-staircase distribution of radiative photons, induced by nonequilibrium electronic fluctuations, and can be tuned via both microscopic properties and driving parameters. Our work highlights the importance of nonequilibrium microscopic details, unlocking new opportunities for active cooling, thermophotovoltaics, thermal imaging and manipulation, and carrier dynamics probing.

Title: One-dimensional $\mathbb{Z}$-classified topological crystalline insulator under space-time inversion symmetry
Authors: Ling Lin, Yongguan Ke, Chaohong Lee
Abstract: We explore a large family of one-dimensional (1D) topological crystalline insulators (TCIs) classified by $\mathbb{Z}$ invariants protected by space-time inversion symmetry. This finding stands in marked contrast to the conventional classification of 1D band topology protected by inversion symmetry and characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-quantized polarization (Berry-Zak phase). Such kind of enriched topological phases relies on imposing restriction on tunneling forms. By considering the nontrivial relative polarization among sublattices (orbitals), we introduce the inversion winding number as a topological invariant for characterizing and categorizing band topology. The bulk-edge correspondence with regard to the inversion winding number is discussed. Leveraging real-space analysis, we discover disorder-induced topological Anderson insulators and propose to experimentally distinguish band topology through relative polarization of edge states or bulk states. Our comprehensive findings present a paradigmatic illustration for the ongoing investigation and classification of band topology in TCIs.

Title: Protected chaos in a topological lattice
Authors: Haydar Sahin, Hakan Akgün, Zhuo Bin Siu, S.M. Rafi-Ul-Islam, Jian Feng Kong, Mansoor B.A. Jalil, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: The erratic nature of chaotic behavior is thought to erode the stability of periodic behavior, including topological oscillations. However, we discover that in the presence of chaos, non-trivial topology not only endures but also provides robust protection to chaotic dynamics within a topological lattice hosting non-linear oscillators. Despite the difficulty in defining topological invariants in non-linear settings, non-trivial topological robustness still persists in the parametric state of chaotic boundary oscillations. We demonstrate this interplay between chaos and topology by incorporating chaotic Chua's circuits into a topological Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) circuit. By extrapolating from the linear limit to deep into the non-linear regime, we find that distinctive correlations in the bulk and edge scroll dynamics effectively capture the topological origin of the protected chaos. Our findings suggest that topologically protected chaos can be robustly achieved across a broad spectrum of periodically-driven systems, thereby offering new avenues for the design of resilient and adaptable non-linear networks.

Title: Re-entrant localization induced by short-range hopping in the fractal Rosenzweig-Porter Model
Authors: Roopayan Ghosh, Madhumita Sarkar, Ivan M. Khaymovich
Abstract: Typically, metallic systems localized under strong disorder exhibit a transition to \imk{delocalization} %finite conduction as kinetic terms increase. In this work, we reveal the opposite effect~--~increasing kinetic terms leads to an unexpected \imk{reduction of mobility, }%suppression of conductivity, enhancing localization of the system, and even lead to re-entrant delocalization transitions. Specifically, we add a nearest-neighbor hopping with amplitude \(\kappa\) to the Rosenzweig-Porter (RP) model with fractal on-site disorder and surprisingly see that, as \(\kappa\) grows, the system initially tends to localization from the fractal phase, but then re-enters the ergodic phase. We build an analytical framework to explain this re-entrant behavior, supported by exact diagonalization results. The interplay between the spatially local $\kappa$ term, insensitive to fractal disorder, and the energy-local RP coupling, sensitive to fine-level spacing structure, drives the observed re-entrant behavior. This mechanism offers a novel pathway to re-entrant localization phenomena in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Quasi-symmetry Constrained Spin Ferromagnetism in Altermagnets
Authors: Mercè Roig, Yue Yu, Rune C. Ekman, Andreas Kreisel, Brian M. Andersen, Daniel F. Agterberg
Abstract: Altermagnets break time-reversal symmetry and their spin-orbit coupling (SOC) allow for an anomalous Hall effect (AHE) that depends on the direction of the Néel ordering vector. The AHE and the ferromagnetic spin moment share the same symmetry and hence are usually proportional. However, density functional theory (DFT) calculations find that the AHE exists with negligible ferromagnetic spin moment for some compounds, whereas it reaches sizable values for other altermagnets. By examining realistic minimal models for altermagnetism in which the DFT phenomenology is captured, we uncover a general SOC-enabled quasi-symmetry, the uniaxial spin space-group, that provides a natural explanation for the amplitude of the ferromagnetic spin moment across the vast range of different altermagnetic materials. Additionally, we derive analytic expressions for the magnetic anisotropy energy, providing a simple means to identify the preferred Néel vector orientation for altermagnets.

Title: Dynamic transition of the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model: multi-particles and inter-particle interaction effects
Authors: Wen Liang, Zhenhua Yu
Abstract: How environments affect dynamics of quantum systems remains a central question in understanding transitions between quantum and classical phenomena and optimizing quantum technologies. A paradigm model to address the above question is the generalized Jaynes-Cummings model, in which a two-level particle is coupled to its environment modeled by a continuum boson modes. Previous analytic solution shows that, starting from the initial state that the particle is in its excited state and the boson modes in their vacuum state, the time evolution of the probability that the particle occupies the excited state exhibits a dynamic transition as the system-environment coupling varies; when the coupling is weak, the probability decays to zero monotonically, while a finite weight of the particle is localized in the excited state when the coupling is sufficiently strong. Here, we study the dynamic transition for the case that $N$ particles are initially excited with the boson modes in their vacuum state. In particular, we access the effects of an all to all Ising type interaction we introduce between the particles. Our calculation is carried out by the non-perturbative time-dependent numerical renormalization group method. We find that the critical coupling for the transition decreases with $N$, and is suppressed (enlarged) by the anti-ferromagnetic (ferromagnetic) Ising interaction. Our results enrich understanding on environmental effects on interacting quantum systems.

Title: Mode-Shell correspondence, a unifying phase space theory in topological physics -- part II: Higher-dimensional spectral invariants
Authors: Lucien Jezequel, Pierre Delplace
Abstract: The mode-shell correspondence relates the number $I_M$ of gapless modes in phase space to a topological \textit{shell invariant} $\Ish$ defined on a close surface -- the shell -- surrounding those modes, namely $I_M=I_S$. In part I, we introduced the mode-shell correspondence for zero-modes of chiral symmetric Hamiltonians (class AIII). In this part II, we extend the correspondence to arbitrary dimension and to both symmetry classes A and AIII. This allows us to include, in particular, $1D$-unidirectional edge modes of Chern insulators, massless $2D$-Dirac and $3D$-Weyl cones, within the same formalism. We provide an expression of $I_M$ that only depends on the dimension of the dispersion relation of the gapless mode, and does not require a translation invariance. Then, we show that the topology of the shell (a circle, a sphere, a torus), that must account for the spreading of the gapless mode in phase space, yields specific expressions of the shell index. Semi-classical expressions of those shell indices are also derived and reduce to either Chern or winding numbers depending on the parity of the mode's dimension. In that way, the mode-shell correspondence provides a unified and systematic topological description of both bulk and boundary gapless modes in any dimension, and in particular includes the bulk-boundary correspondence. We illustrate the generality of the theory by analyzing several models of semimetals and insulators, both on lattices and in the continuum, and also discuss weak and higher-order topological phases within this framework. Although this paper is a continuation of Part I, the content remains sufficiently independent to be mostly read separately.

Title: Out-of-time-order correlator computation based on discrete truncated Wigner approximation
Authors: Tatsuhiko Shirai, Takashi Mori
Abstract: We propose a method based on the discrete truncated Wigner approximation (DTWA) for computing out-of-time-order correlators. This method is applied to long-range interacting quantum spin systems where the interactions decay as a power law with distance. As a demonstration, we use a squared commutator of local operators and its higher-order extensions that describe quantum information scrambling under Hamilton dynamics. Our results reveal that the DTWA method accurately reproduces the exact dynamics of the average spreading of quantum information (i.e., the squared commutator) across all time regimes in strongly long-range interacting systems. We also identify limitations in the DTWA method when capturing dynamics in weakly long-range interacting systems and the fastest spreading of quantum information. Then we apply the DTWA method to investigate the system-size dependence of the scrambling time in strongly long-range interacting systems. We reveal that the scaling behavior of the scrambling time for large system sizes qualitatively changes depending on the interaction range. This work provides and demonstrates a new technique to study scrambling dynamics in long-range interacting quantum spin systems.

Title: Nonequilibrium friction and free energy estimates for kinetic coarse-graining -- Driven particles in responsive media
Authors: Sebastian Milster, Joachim Dzubiella, Gerhard Stock, Steffen Wolf
Abstract: Predicting the molecular friction and energy landscapes under nonequilibrium conditions is key to coarse-graining the dynamics of selective solute transport through complex, fluctuating and responsive media, e.g., polymeric materials such as hydrogels, cellular membranes or ion channels. The analysis of equilibrium ensembles already allows such a coarse-graining for very mild nonequilibrium conditions. Yet in the presence of stronger external driving and/or inhomogeneous setups, the transport process is governed apart from a potential of mean force also by a nontrivial position- and velocity-dependent friction. It is therefore important to find suitable and efficient methods to estimate the mean force and the friction landscape, which then can be used in a low-dimensional, coarse-grained Langevin framework to predict the system's transport properties and timescales. In this work, we evaluate different coarse-graining approaches based on constant-velocity constraint simulations for generating such estimates using two model systems, which are a 1D responsive barrier as a minimalistic model and a single tracer driven through a 3D bead-spring polymer membrane as a more sophisticated problem. Finally, we demonstrate that the estimates from 3D constant-velocity simulations yield the correct velocity-dependent friction, which can be directly utilized for coarse-grained (1D) Langevin simulations with constant external driving forces.

Abstract: The thermopower $\alpha$ (also known as the Seebeck coefficient) is one of the most fundamental material characteristics for understanding charge carrier transport in thermoelectric materials. Here, we revisit the Pisarenko formula for the thermopower, which was traditionally considered valid only for non-degenerate semiconductors. We demonstrate that regardless of the dominating scattering mechanism, the Pisarenko formula describes accurately enough the relationship between thermopower $\alpha$ and charge carrier concentration $n$ beyond the non-degenerate limit. Moreover, the Pisarenko formula provides a simple thermopower-conductivity relation, $\alpha = \pm \frac{k_{\mathrm{B}}}{e} (b - \ln \sigma)$, valid for materials with $\alpha > 90$ $\mu$V K$^{-1}$ when acoustic phonon scattering is predominant. This offers an alternative way to analyze electron transport when Hall measurements are difficult or inaccessible. Additionally, we show how the Pisarenko formula can be used to estimate the maximum power factor of a thermoelectric material from the weighted mobility of a single, not necessarily optimized, sample at any given temperature.

Title: Single file dynamics of tethered random walkers
Authors: Santos Bravo Yuste, A. Baumgaertner, E. Abad
Abstract: We consider the single-file dynamics of $N$ identical random walkers moving with diffusivity $D$ in one dimension (walkers bounce off each other when attempting to overtake). Additionally, we require that the separation between neighboring walkers cannot exceed a threshold value $\Delta$ and therefore call them ``tethered walkers'' (they behave as if bounded by strings which tighten fully when reaching the maximum length $\Delta$). For finite $\Delta$, we study the diffusional relaxation to the equilibrium state and characterize the latter [the long-time relaxation is exponential with a characteristic time that scales as $(N\Delta)^2/D$]. In particular, our approximate approach for the $N$-particle probability distribution yields the one-particle distribution function of the central and edge particles [the first two positional moments are given as power expansions in $\Delta/\sqrt{4Dt}$]. For $N=2$, we find an exact solution (both in the continuum case and on-lattice) and use it to test our approximations for one-particle distributions, positional moments, and correlations. For finite $\Delta$ and arbitrary $N$, edge particles move with an effective long-time diffusivity $D/N$, in sharp contrast with the $1/\ln(N)$-behavior observed when $\Delta=\infty$. Finally, we compute the probability distribution of the equilibrium system length and the associated entropy. We find that the force required to change this length by a given amount is linear in this quantity, the (entropic) spring constant being $6k_BT/(N\Delta^2)$. In this respect, the system behaves like an ideal polymer. Our main analytical results are confirmed by Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Applied-field magnetic structure and spectroscopy shifts of the effective spin-$\frac{1}{2}$, $XY$-like magnet Li$_2$CoCl$_4$
Authors: Zachary W. Riedel, Mykhaylo Ozerov, Stuart Calder, Daniel P. Shoemaker
Abstract: Insulators containing chains of magnetic transition metal cations provide platforms for probing spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dynamics and quantum critical behavior. Li$_2$CoCl$_4$ contains edge-sharing CoCl$_6$ octahedra that form chains along the crystallographic $c$ axis and orders antiferromagnetically at zero field, but questions remain about its applied-field magnetic structure and the Co$^{2+}$ spin state. Here, we show with neutron diffraction on a polycrystalline sample how the anti-aligned chains of cobalt moments undergo a spin-flop transition to a field-aligned ferromagnetic state above 1.6 T. Further, using magnetic resonance absorption measurements and paramagnetic spin models, we reveal the strongly anisotropic nature of the Co$^{2+}$ ion's $XY$-like magnetic behavior ($g_{\parallel}=2.77$ and $g_{\perp}=5.23$) and its $J=\frac{1}{2}$ ground state. We, therefore, supply the magnetic structures and anisotropic description needed to explore the dynamics of the field-driven magnetic phases, laying the foundation for further experimental and theoretical studies.

Title: Flexocoupling-induced phonons and ferrons in van der Waals ferroelectrics

Abstract: The contribution of flexoelectric coupling to the long-range order parameter fluctuations in ferroics can be critically important to the ferron dispersion and related polar, pyroelectric and electrocaloric properties. Here we calculate analytically the dispersion relations of soft optic and acoustic flexocoupling-induced phonons and ferrons by incorporating the flexoelectric coupling, damping, and higher elastic gradients in the Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire free energy functional using the van der Waals uniaxial ferrielectric CuInP2S6 as an example. We analyze the changes in the flexocoupling-induced phonon and ferron spectra arising from the appearance of spatially modulated phases induced by the flexoelectric coupling. We show that the free energy landscape of CuInP2S6 determines the specific features of its phonon spectra and ferron dispersion. We also discuss the contributions of optic and acoustic flexocoupling-induced ferrons to the pyroelectric and electrocaloric responses of CuInP2S6 at low temperatures.

Title: Superconducting Coherence Peak in Near-Field Radiative Heat Transfer
Authors: Wenbo Sun, Zhuomin M. Zhang, Zubin Jacob
Abstract: Enhancement and peaks in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT) typically arise due to surface phonon-polaritons, plasmon-polaritons, and electromagnetic (EM) modes in structured materials. However, the role of material quantum coherence in enhancing near-field radiative heat transfer remains unexplored. Here, we unravel that NFRHT in superconductor-ferromagnetic systems displays a unique peak at the superconducting phase transition that originates from the quantum coherence of Bogoliubov quasiparticles in superconductors. Our theory takes into account evanescent EM radiation emanating from fluctuating currents related to Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles in stark contrast to the current-current correlations induced by free electrons in conventional materials. Our proposed NFRHT configuration exploits ferromagnetic resonance at frequencies deep inside the superconducting band gap to isolate this superconducting coherence peak. Furthermore, we reveal that Cooper pairs and Bogoliubov quasiparticles have opposite effects on near-field thermal radiation and isolate their effects on many-body radiative heat transfer near superconductors. Our proposed phenomenon can have applications for developing thermal isolators and heat sinks in superconducting circuits.

Title: Pathways to crystal chirality An algorithm to identify new displacive chiral phase transitions
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Aldo H. Romero, Eric Bousquet
Abstract: We present an algorithm that integrates pseudosymmetry search with first-principles calculations to systematically identify achiral parent structures and establish potential chiral displacive transitions linking them to their corresponding chiral phases within the 22 enantiomorphic space groups. This approach enables a robust exploration of structural relationships, offering new insights into symmetry-driven properties. Our workflow streamlines the discovery of displacive chiral phase transitions driven by soft phonon modes, providing insights into the mechanisms of structural chirality in inorganic materials. We apply this methodology on the chiral phases of TeO$_2$, Na$_2$SeO$_9$, Sr$_2$As$_2$O$_7$, As$_2$O$_5$, Rb$_2$Be$_2$O$_3$, and CaTe$_2$O$_3$. Demonstrating that some do not have a minimal supergroup that allows for an achiral phase; some can have a minimal supergroup, still, no unstable phonon mode exists in the achiral phase; and somewhere the minimal supergroup exists with a soft phonon mode connecting the identified achiral phase and the chiral phase through small continuous displacements.

Title: Hydrodynamic Coulomb drag in odd electron liquids
Authors: Dmitry Zverevich, Dmitri B. Gutman, Alex Levchenko
Abstract: We consider the problem of Coulomb drag resistance in bilayers of electron liquids with spontaneously broken time-reversal symmetry. In the hydrodynamic regime, the viscosity tensor of such fluids has a nonvanishing odd component. In this scenario, fluctuating viscous stresses drive the propagation of plasmons, whose dispersion relations are modified by nondissipative odd viscous waves. Coulomb coupling of electron density fluctuations induces a drag force exerted by one layer on the other in the presence of a steady flow. This drag force can be expressed through the dynamic structure factor of the electron liquid, which is peaked at frequencies corresponding to plasmon resonances in the bilayer. As a result, the drag resistivity depends on the dissipationless odd viscosity of the fluid. We quantify this effect and present a general theory of hydrodynamic fluctuations applicable to odd electron liquids, both with and without Galilean invariance.

Title: Sum rules for x-ray circular and linear dichroism based on complete magnetic multipole basis
Authors: Y. Yamasaki, Y. Ishii, N. Sasabe
Abstract: X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and X-ray magnetic linear dichroism (XMLD) are powerful spectroscopic techniques for probing magnetic properties in solids. In this study, we revisit the XMCD and XMLD sum rules within a complete magnetic multipole basis that incorporates both spinless and spinful multipoles. We demonstrate that these multipoles can be clearly distinguished and individually detected through the sum-rule formalism. Within this framework, the anisotropic magnetic dipole term is naturally derived in XMCD, offering a microscopic origin for ferromagnetic-like behavior in antiferromagnets. Furthermore, we derive the sum rules for out-of-plane and in-plane XMLD regarding electric quadrupole contributions defined based on the complete multipole basis. Our theoretical approach provides a unified, symmetry-consistent framework for analyzing dichroic signals in various magnetic materials. These findings deepen the understanding of XMCD and XMLD and open pathways to exploring complex magnetic structures and spin-orbit coupling effects in emergent magnetic materials.

Title: Activation entropy helps explain anomalous flow stress temperature dependence in copper
Authors: Mohammadhossein Nahavandian, Liam Myhill, Enrique Martinez
Abstract: Thermal activation of dislocations is critical for predicting the mechanical response of materials under common experimental conditions. According to transition state theory (TST), the rate for the system to overcome free energy barriers depends on an attempt frequency, activation free energy, and temperature. We computed the rate for edge and screw dislocation dipoles to overcome their interaction fields at various temperatures, Langevin friction coefficients, and shear stresses using Molecular Dynamics (MD), Schoecks entropy formalism and compared with Kramers rate theory. Kramers theory matches the rates computed dynamically, which depend on Langevin friction, increasing with weaker friction. Statically, using Schoeck formalism to compute the entropy along the minimum energy path (MEP), we found significant entropic effects that lead to an increase of the critical resolved shear stress with temperature and could help explain the long-standing anomaly observed at low to intermediate temperatures in copper and other metals, where the flow stress increases with temperature.

Title: Room-Temperature Pauli Spin Blockade and Current Rectification in 15-13-15 Armchair Graphene Nanoribbon Heterostructures
Authors: David M T Kuo
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the electronic structures of 13-11-13 and 15-13-15 armchair graphene nanoribbon (AGNR) superlattices (SLs) using a tight-binding model. We demonstrate that the conduction and valence subbands of 15-13-15 AGNR SLs can be accurately described by the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, with topologically protected interface states emerging at the junctions between 15-AGNR and 13-AGNR segments. These interface states enable the formation of quantum dot arrays with energy levels well separated from bulk states, making them promising candidates for high-temperature solid-state quantum processors. For 15-13-15 AGNRH segments, we observe both localized zigzag edge states and topologically protected interface states under longitudinal electric fields, with the latter providing efficient tunneling channels in contrast to the less conductive edge states. We further explore nonlinear charge transport through these interface states under Pauli spin blockade, showing that tunneling current spectra reveal charge stability diagrams and Coulomb blockade oscillations, consistent with experimental findings in other serial double quantum dot systems. Additionally, we examine the impact of orbital offsets on tunneling current rectification and demonstrate that significant current rectification is achieved over a wide temperature range when level broadening is optimized. These results highlight the potential of 15-13-15 AGNRHs for robust spin-current conversion and applications in quantum devices, offering advantages over other proposed structures due to precise tunability of key parameters via bottom-up synthesis techniques and the ease of two-gate electrode integration.

Title: Dirac charge in antiferromagnetic topological semimetals
Authors: Kohei Hattori, Hikaru Watanabe, Ryotaro Arita
Abstract: Topological node of electronic bands can carry emergent charge degree of freedom such as the Berry curvature monopole of the Weyl semimetals, which results in intriguing transport and optical phenomena. In this study, we discuss the existence of the hidden "Dirac charge" and its detection via the photocurrent response in antiferromagnetic (AFM) Dirac semimetals. In light of the Berry curvature defined in the spin and spin-charge-mixed parameter space, we identify Dirac charges as sources or sinks of the Berry curvature in the generalized parameter space. We demonstrate that this Dirac charge can be detected via the photocurrent driven by the spin-charge-coupled motive force. By using real-time simulation, we find that the Dirac charge plays a significant role in the photocurrent generation in AFM Dirac semimetals. This work reveals the hidden property of the Dirac points in AFM Dirac semimetals.

Title: Fractional Quantum Hall Anyons via the Algebraic Topology of Exotic Flux Quanta
Authors: Hisham Sati, Urs Schreiber
Abstract: Fractional quantum Hall systems (FQH), due to their experimentally observed anyonic topological order, are a main contender for future hardware-implementation of error-protected quantum registers ("topological qbits") subject to error-protected quantum operations ("topological quantum gates"), both plausibly necessary for future quantum computing at useful scale, but both remaining insufficiently understood. Here we present a novel non-Lagrangian effective description of FQH anyons, based on previously elusive proper global quantization of effective topological flux in extraordinary non-abelian cohomology theories. This directly translates the system's quantum -observables, -states, -symmetries, and -measurement channels into purely algebro-topological analysis of local systems of Hilbert spaces over the quantized flux moduli spaces. Under the hypothesis -- for which we provide a fair bit of evidence -- that the appropriate effective flux quantization of FQH systems is in 2-Cohomotopy theory (a cousin of Hypothesis H in high-energy physics), the results here are rigorously derived and as such might usefully inform laboratory searches for novel anyonic phenomena in FQH systems and hence for topological quantum hardware.

Title: Apparent inconsistency between Streda formula and Hall conductivity in reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall effect in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Yi Huang, Seth Musser, Jihang Zhu, Yang-Zhi Chou, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: Recent experiments in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ (tMoTe$_2$) have uncovered a rich landscape of correlated phases. In this work, we investigate the reentrant integer quantum anomalous Hall (RIQAH) states reported in F. Xu, arXiv.2504.06972 which display a notable mismatch between the Hall conductivity measured via transport and that inferred from the Streda formula. We argue that this discrepancy can be explained if the RIQAH state is a quantum Hall bubble/Wigner crystal phase, analogous to similar well-established phenomena in 2D GaAs quantum wells. While this explains the RIQAH state at filling $\nu = -0.63$, the other RIQAH state at $\nu = -0.7$ has a smaller slope, necessitating a different interpretation. We propose that this discrepancy arises due to a nearby resistive peak masking the true slope. Furthermore, we identify this resistive peak as a signature of a phase transition near $\nu = -0.75$, possibly driven by a Van Hove singularity. The anomalous Hall response and Landau fan evolution across this transition suggest a change in Fermi surface topology and a metallic phase with non-quantized Hall response. These observations offer new insights into the nature of the RIQAH states and raise the possibility that the nearby superconducting phase may have a valley-imbalanced metal parent state.

Title: Quantum phase transition in a double quantum dot Josephson junction driven by electron-electron interactions
Authors: Cong Li, Yiyan Wang, Bing Dong
Abstract: In this work, we employ a surrogate BCS model with discrete energy levels to investigate a hybrid system comprising two quantum dots (QD1 and QD2), where QD1 is tunnel-coupled to two superconducting leads. Through exact diagonalization of this system, we obtain numerically exact solutions that enable rigorous computation of key physical quantities. Our analysis reveals a rich phase diagram featuring multiple controllable phase transitions mediated by quantum dot interactions. Specifically, the system first undergoes an initial phase transition when tuning QD2's interaction strength while maintaining QD1 in the non-interacting regime. Subsequent adjustment of QD1's interaction induces a secondary phase transition, followed by a third transition arising from inter-dot coupling modulation. Furthermore, we demonstrate that parallel magnetic field application can drive reversible ferromagnetic-antiferromagnetic phase transitions under specific parameter conditions. Finally, we report the emergence of non-local magnetization phenomena when subjecting QD1 to weak magnetic fields. And our results demonstrate that the orientation of nonlocal magnetization can be precisely manipulated through systematic adjustment of the on-site interaction strength $U_2$ in QD2.

Title: Generalization performance of narrow one-hidden layer networks in the teacher-student setting
Authors: Jean Barbier, Federica Gerace, Alessandro Ingrosso, Clarissa Lauditi, Enrico M. Malatesta, Gibbs Nwemadji, Rodrigo Pérez Ortiz
Abstract: Understanding the generalization abilities of neural networks for simple input-output distributions is crucial to account for their learning performance on real datasets. The classical teacher-student setting, where a network is trained from data obtained thanks to a label-generating teacher model, serves as a perfect theoretical test bed. In this context, a complete theoretical account of the performance of fully connected one-hidden layer networks in the presence of generic activation functions is lacking. In this work, we develop such a general theory for narrow networks, i.e. networks with a large number of hidden units, yet much smaller than the input dimension. Using methods from statistical physics, we provide closed-form expressions for the typical performance of both finite temperature (Bayesian) and empirical risk minimization estimators, in terms of a small number of weight statistics. In doing so, we highlight the presence of a transition where hidden neurons specialize when the number of samples is sufficiently large and proportional to the number of parameters of the network. Our theory accurately predicts the generalization error of neural networks trained on regression or classification tasks with either noisy full-batch gradient descent (Langevin dynamics) or full-batch gradient descent.

Title: Microsecond-scale high-survival and number-resolved detection of ytterbium atom arrays
Authors: Alessandro Muzi Falconi, Riccardo Panza, Sara Sbernardori, Riccardo Forti, Ralf Klemt, Omar Abdel Karim, Matteo Marinelli, Francesco Scazza
Abstract: Scalable atom-based quantum platforms for simulation, computing, and metrology require fast high-fidelity, low-loss imaging of individual atoms. Standard fluorescence detection methods rely on continuous cooling, limiting the detection range to one atom and imposing long imaging times that constrain the experimental cycle and mid-circuit conditional operations. Here, we demonstrate fast and low-loss single-atom imaging in optical tweezers without active cooling, enabled by the favorable properties of ytterbium. Collecting fluorescence over microsecond timescales, we reach single-atom discrimination fidelities above 99.9% and single-shot survival probabilities above 99.5%. Through interleaved recooling pulses, as short as a few hundred microseconds for atoms in magic traps, we perform tens of consecutive detections with constant atom-retention probability per image - an essential step toward fast atom re-use in tweezer-based processors and clocks. Our scheme does not induce parity projection in multiply-occupied traps, enabling number-resolved single-shot detection of several atoms per site. This allows us to study the near-deterministic preparation of single atoms in tweezers driven by blue-detuned light-assisted collisions. Moreover, the near-diffraction-limited spatial resolution of our low-loss imaging enables number-resolved microscopy in dense arrays, opening the way to direct site-occupancy readout in optical lattices for density fluctuation and correlation measurements in quantum simulators.

Title: Super Lax Pairs and Infinite Symmetries in The $1/r^2$ System
Authors: B. Sriram Shastry (AT &amp; T Bell Laboratories, Murray Hill, N.J.), Bill Sutherland (Department of Physics, University of Utah, Salt Lake City)
Abstract: We present an algebraic structure that provides an interesting and novel link between supersymmetry and quantum integrability. This structure underlies two classes of models that are exactly solvable in 1-dimension and belong to the $1/r^2 $ family of interactions. The algebra consists of the commutation between a ``Super- Hamiltonian'', and two other operators, in a Hilbert space that is an enlargement of the original one by introducing fermions. The commutation relations reduce to quantal Ordered Lax equations when projected to the original subspace, and to a statement about the ``Harmonic Lattice Potential'' structure of the Lax operator. These in turn lead to a highly automatic proof of the integrability of these models. In the case of the discrete $SU(n)-1/r^2$ model, the `` Super-Hamiltonian'' is again an $SU(m)-1/r^2$ model with a related $m$, providing an interesting hierarchy of models.

Title: Classical Simulation of High Temperature Quantum Ising Models
Authors: Elizabeth Crosson, Samuel Slezak
Abstract: We consider generalized quantum Ising models, including those which could describe disordered materials or quantum annealers, and we prove that for all temperatures above a system-size independent threshold the path integral Monte Carlo method based on worldline heat-bath updates always mixes to stationarity in time $\mathcal{O}(n \log n)$ for an $n$ qubit system, and therefore provides a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme for the partition function. This result holds whenever the temperature is greater than four plus twice the maximum interaction degree (valence) over all qubits, measured in units of the local coupling strength. For example, this implies that the classical simulation of the thermal state of a superconducting device modeling a frustrated quantum Ising model with maximum valence of 6 and coupling strengths of 1 GHz is always possible at temperatures above 800 mK. Despite the quantum system being at high temperature, the classical spin system resulting from the quantum-to-classical mapping contains strong couplings which cause the single-site Glauber dynamics to mix slowly, therefore this result depends on the use of worldline updates (which are a form of cluster updates that can be implemented efficiently). This result places definite constraints on the temperatures required for a quantum advantage in analog quantum simulation with various NISQ devices based on equilibrium states of quantum Ising models.

Title: Projective symmetries of three-dimensional TQFTs
Authors: Jackson Van Dyke
Abstract: Quantum field theory has various projective characteristics which are captured by what are called anomalies. This paper explores this idea in the context of fully-extended three-dimensional topological quantum field theories (TQFTs). Given a three-dimensional TQFT (valued in the Morita 3-category of fusion categories), the anomaly identified herein is an obstruction to gauging a naturally occurring orthogonal group of symmetries. In other words, the classical symmetry group almost acts: There is a lack of coherence at the top level. This lack of coherence is captured by a "higher (central) extension" of the orthogonal group, obtained via a modification of the obstruction theory of Etingof-Nikshych-Ostrik-Meir [ENO10]. This extension tautologically acts on the given TQFT/fusion category, and this precisely classifies a projective (equivalently anomalous) TQFT. We explain the sense in which this is an analogue of the classical spin representation. This is an instance of a phenomenon emphasized by Freed [Fre23]: Quantum theory is projective. We also establish a general relationship between the language of projectivity/anomalies and the language of topological symmetries. We also identify a universal anomaly associated with any theory which is appropriately "simple".

Title: Improving the five-point bootstrap
Authors: David Poland, Valentina Prilepina, Petar Tadić
Abstract: We present a new algorithm for the numerical evaluation of five-point conformal blocks in $d$-dimensions, greatly improving the efficiency of their computation. To do this we use an appropriate ansatz for the blocks as a series expansion in radial coordinates, derive a set of recursion relations for the unknown coefficients in the ansatz, and evaluate the series using a Padé approximant to accelerate its convergence. We then study the $\langle\sigma\sigma\epsilon\sigma\sigma\rangle$ correlator in the 3d critical Ising model by truncating the operator product expansion (OPE) and only including operators with conformal dimension below a cutoff $\Delta\leqslant \Delta_{\rm cutoff}$. We approximate the contributions of the operators above the cutoff by the corresponding contributions in a suitable disconnected five-point correlator. Using this approach, we compute a number of OPE coefficients with greater accuracy than previous methods.

Title: Experimental signatures of Hilbert-space ergodicity: Universal bitstring distributions and applications in noise learning
Authors: Adam L. Shaw, Daniel K. Mark, Joonhee Choi, Ran Finkelstein, Pascal Scholl, Soonwon Choi, Manuel Endres
Abstract: Systems reaching thermal equilibrium are ubiquitous. For classical systems, this phenomenon is typically understood statistically through ergodicity in phase space, but translating this to quantum systems is a long-standing problem of interest. Recently a strong notion of quantum ergodicity has been proposed, namely that isolated, global quantum states uniformly explore their available state space, dubbed Hilbert-space ergodicity. Here we observe signatures of this process with an experimental Rydberg quantum simulator and various numerical models, before generalizing to the case of a local quantum system interacting with its environment. For a closed system, where the environment is a complementary subsystem, we predict and observe a smooth quantum-to-classical transition in that observables progress from large, quantum fluctuations to small, Gaussian fluctuations as the bath size grows. This transition exhibits universal properties on a quantitative level amongst a wide range of systems, including those at finite temperature, those with itinerant particles, and random circuits. For an open system, where the environment is uncontrolled, we predict the statistics of observables under largely arbitrary noise channels including those with correlated errors, allowing us to discriminate between candidate error models both for continuous Hamiltonian time evolution and for digital random circuits. This allows for computationally efficient experimental noise learning, and more broadly is a new avenue for quantitatively classifying the behavior of noisy quantum systems. Ultimately our results clarify the role of ergodicity in quantum dynamics, with fundamental and practical consequences.

Title: Stability and Loop Models from Decohering Non-Abelian Topological Order
Authors: Pablo Sala, Ruben Verresen
Abstract: Decohering topological order (TO) is central to the many-body physics of open quantum matter and decoding transitions. We identify relevant statistical mechanical models for decohering non-Abelian TO, which have been crucial for understanding the error threshold of Abelian stabilizer codes. The decohered density matrix can be described by loop models, whose topological loop weight $N$ is given by the quantum dimension of the decohering anyon -- reducing to the Ising model if $N=1$. In particular, the Rényi-$n$ moments of the decohered state correspond to $n$ coupled O$(N)$ loop models, and we exactly diagonalize the density matrix at maximal error rate. This allows us to relate the fidelity between two logically distinct ground states to properties of random O$(N)$ loop and spin models. Utilizing the literature on loop models, we find a remarkable stability to quantum channels which proliferate non-Abelian anyons with large quantum dimension, with the possibility of critical phases for smaller dimensions. We confirm our framework with exact results for Kitaev quantum double models, and with numerical simulations for the non-Abelian phase of the Kitaev honeycomb model. The latter is an example of a non-fixed-point wavefunction with non-bosonic and non-integral anyon dimensions. Our work opens up the possibility of non-Abelian TO being robust against maximally proliferating certain anyons, which can inform error-correction studies of these topological memories.

Title: Transmission eigenvalue distribution in disordered media from radiant field theory
Authors: David Gaspard, Arthur Goetschy
Abstract: We develop a field-theoretic framework, called radiant field theory, to calculate the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation in disordered media. At its core is a self-consistent transport equation for a $2\times 2$ matrix radiance, reminiscent of the radiative transfer equation but capable of capturing coherent interference effects. This framework goes beyond the limitations of the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar theory by accounting for both quasiballistic and diffusive regimes. It also handles open geometries inaccessible to standard wave-equation solvers such as infinite slabs. Analytical and numerical solutions are provided for these geometries, highlighting in particular the impact of the waveguide shape and the grazing modes on the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime. By removing the macroscopic assumptions of random matrix models, this microscopic theory enables the calculation of transmission statistics in regimes previously out of reach. It also provides a foundation for exploring more complex observables and physical effects relevant to wavefront shaping in realistic disordered systems.

Title: Radiant Field Theory: A Transport Approach to Shaped Wave Transmission through Disordered Media
Authors: David Gaspard, Arthur Goetschy
Abstract: We present a field-theoretic framework to characterize the distribution of transmission eigenvalues for coherent wave propagation through disordered media. The central outcome is a transport equation for a matrix-valued radiance, analogous to the classical radiative transport equation but capable of capturing coherent effects encoded in the transmission matrix. Unlike the Dorokhov-Mello-Pereyra-Kumar (DMPK) theory, our approach does not rely on the isotropy hypothesis, which presumes uniform angular scattering by material slices. As a result, it remains valid beyond the diffusive regime, accurately describing the transmission eigenvalue distribution in the quasiballistic regime as well. Moreover, the framework is more versatile than the DMPK theory, enabling straightforward incorporation of experimental realities such as absorption and incomplete channel control. These factors are frequently encountered in wave experiments on complex media but have lacked an ab initio theoretical treatment until now. We validate our predictions through numerical simulations based on the microscopic wave equation, confirming the accuracy and broad applicability of the theory.

Title: Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction
Authors: Ying-Ting Yeh, Janghoon Ock, Shagun Maheshwari, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: We investigate the use of transformer-based language models, RoBERTa, T5, and LLaMA, for predicting the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from textual representations that encode key material features such as chemical composition, crystal system, space group, number of atoms per unit cell, valence electron count, and other relevant electronic and structural properties. Quantum chemistry simulations such as DFT provide accurate predictions but are computationally intensive, limiting their feasibility for large-scale materials screening. Shallow ML models offer faster alternatives but typically require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material features into structured numerical inputs, often at the cost of losing critical descriptive information. In contrast, our approach leverages pretrained language models to process textual data directly, eliminating the need for manual feature engineering. We construct material descriptions in two formats: structured strings that combine key features in a consistent template, and natural language narratives generated using the ChatGPT API. For each model, we append a custom regression head and perform task-specific finetuning on a curated dataset of inorganic compounds. Our results show that finetuned language models, particularly the decoder-only LLaMA-3 architecture, can outperform conventional approaches in prediction accuracy and flexibility, achieving an MAE of 0.25 eV and R2 of 0.89, compared to the best shallow ML baseline, which achieved an MAE of 0.32 eV and R2 of 0.84. Notably, LLaMA-3 achieves competitive accuracy with minimal finetuning, suggesting its architecture enables more transferable representations for scientific tasks. This work demonstrates the effectiveness of finetuned language models for scientific property prediction and provides a scalable, language-native framework for materials informatics.

Title: Explicit Pfaffian Formula for Amplitudes of Fermionic Gaussian Pure States in Arbitrary Pauli Bases
Authors: M. A. Rajabpour, M. A. Seifi Mirjafarlou, Reyhaneh Khasseh
Abstract: The explicit computation of amplitudes for fermionic Gaussian pure states in arbitrary Pauli bases is a long-standing challenge in quantum many-body physics, with significant implications for quantum tomography, experimental studies, and quantum dynamics. These calculations are essential for analyzing complex properties beyond traditional measures, such as formation probabilities, global entanglement, and entropy in non-standard bases, where exact and computationally efficient methods remain underdeveloped. In addition to these physical applications, having explicit formulas is crucial for optimizing negative log-likelihood functions in quantum tomography, a key task in the NISQ era. In this work, we present an explicit Pfaffian formula (Theorem 1) for determining these amplitudes in arbitrary Pauli bases, utilizing a matrix whose structure reflects the qubit parity. Additionally, we introduce a recursive relation (Theorem 2) that connects amplitudes for systems with varying qubit numbers, enabling scalable computations for large systems. Together, these results provide a versatile framework for studying global entanglement, Shannon-Rényi entropies, formation probabilities, and performing efficient quantum tomography, thereby significantly expanding the computational toolkit for analyzing complex quantum systems. Finally, we utilize our formalism to determine the post-measurement entanglement entropy, reflecting how local measurements alter entanglement, and compare the outcomes with conformal field theory predictions.

Authors: Lorenzo Bagnasacco, Fabio Taddei, Vittorio Giovannetti
Abstract: By decoupling the geometric from the dynamical contributions in the scattering processes, we develop a method to compute the scattering matrix of electrons in a one-dimensional coherent conductor connected to two electrodes. In particular, we demonstrate that, in the high-energy regime, the transmission matrix converges to the Berry operator of the system. We showcase the method through several examples featuring different in-plane magnetic field profiles. Notably, our results reveal the possibility of achieving near-perfect spin-flip transmission, highlighting potential applications in spintronics.

Abstract: We revisit the measurement-induced phase transition (MPT) in Clifford circuits, which are both classically simulable and exhibit critical behavior widely believed to be distinct from classical percolation theory, using ZX-calculus. We analyze the MPT in a dynamical model composed of CNOT, SWAP, identity gates, and Bell-pair measurements, respectively, arranged randomly in a brickwork pattern. Our circuits exhibit a transition that is seemingly distinct from classical percolation based on standard arguments, that is in line with the prevailing understanding in the field. In contrast, by employing ZX-calculus based simplification techniques, we unveil a hidden percolation transition within the circuit structure. Over a range of parameters tied to the probabilities for applying different gates, we demonstrate that the classical percolation transition in the ZX-simplified network coincides with the MPT observed through mutual information. Our findings suggest that the MPT in Clifford circuits is, in fact, controlled by a classical percolation transition in disguise.

Title: Passive leakage removal unit based on a disordered transmon array
Authors: Gonzalo Martín-Vázquez, Taneli Tolppanen, Matti Silveri
Abstract: Leakage out from the qubit subspace compromises standard quantum error correction protocols and is a challenge for practical quantum computing. We propose a passive leakage removal unit based on an array of coupled disordered transmons and last-site reset by feedback-measurement or dissipation. The transmons have parametric disorder both in frequency and anharmonicity such that the qubit subspace is protected by localization through energy level mismatch while the energy levels for leakage excitations are in resonance for maximized leakage mobility. Leakage excitations propagate through the idle transmons until reaching the last site with feedback-measurement or dissipation removing them. For removing leakage excitations, we find two optimal measurement rates, which are comprehensively understood through two distinct timescales between the propagation and disintegration of leakage excitations. Based only on an array of standard transmon devices, our approach is readily compatible with existing superconducting quantum processor designs under realistic conditions.

Title: Broadband directional thermal emission with anisothermal microsources
Authors: Florian Herz, Riccardo Messina, Philippe Ben-Abdallah
Abstract: Thermal emission is naturally spatially incoherent and lacks directionality. Here, we demonstrate that by precisely controlling the spatial temperature distribution within a solid, directional thermal emission can be achieved across a broad spectral range. These anisothermal sources open new avenues for manipulating radiative heat flux at the microscale and hold promise for applications in thermal management and energy conversion, enabling more efficient and targeted thermal control.

Abstract: Analog computers hold promise to significantly reduce the energy consumption of artificial intelligence algorithms, but commercialization has been hampered by a fundamental scientific challenge - how to reliably store and process analog information with high precision. We present an approach based upon metal oxide memory cells that undergo controlled self-heating during programming with a newly developed, electro-thermo-chemical gate. The gate uniformly spreads heat and electrochemical reactions to enable wide, bulk-vacancy modulation which yields nine orders of magnitude in tunable analog resistance - three orders greater than other devices reported, with thousands of states. The gating profoundly reduces noise and drift to enable precision programming to targeted states within a few operations, lowering conductance errors by two orders of magnitude relative to other devices reported. Simulations show improvement in computational energy efficiency by at least 10x over other devices due to far greater scalability at higher precision. The results overturn long-held assumptions about the poor reliability and precision of analog resistance devices and opens the door to manufacturable, bulk metal-oxide devices and new applications that leverage high precision.

Title: Continuously trapped matter-wave interferometry in magic Floquet-Bloch band structures

Abstract: Trapped matter-wave interferometry offers the promise of compact high-precision local force sensing. However, the trap itself can introduce new systematic errors which are absent in traditional free-fall interferometers. We describe and demonstrate a novel Floquet-engineered platform for compact, continuously trapped atom interferometry which is intrinsically robust against trap noise and beamsplitter pulse duration. A non-interacting degenerate quantum gas undergoes position-space Bloch oscillations through an amplitude-modulated optical lattice, whose resulting Floquet-Bloch band structure includes Landau-Zener beamsplitters and Bragg mirrors, forming the components of a Mach-Zehnder interferometric force sensor. We identify, realize, and experimentally characterize magic band structures, analogous to the magic wavelengths employed in optical lattice clocks, for which the interferometric phase is insensitive to lattice intensity noise. We leverage the intrinsic programmability of the Floquet synthesis approach to demonstrate a variety of interferometer structures, highlighting the potential of this technique for quantum force sensors which are tunable, compact, simple, and robust.
