Title: Quantum Mechanics of an Abrikosov Vortex in Nanofabricated Pinning Potential
Authors: Elmeri O. Rivasto
Abstract: A superconducting device is proposed for experimentally investigating whether an Abrikosov vortex can be modeled as a quantum mechanical quasiparticle. The design process of a type-II superconducting device capable of reliably pinning a single Abrikosov vortex is presented, creating a particle-in-a-box-like system. The proposed device consists of a cylindrically symmetric Nb film, 30 nm in diameter and 5 nm thick, with a 14 nm diameter artificial pinning center at its center. Time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau simulations indicate robust single-vortex pinning under an applied field of 6 T. The presumed quantized energy levels and associated quantum wavefunctions of the vortex quasiparticle are obtained by numerically solving the two-dimensional time-independent Schrödinger equation for this system. It is shown that distinguishing the ground and first excited states is experimentally feasible. Beyond fundamental physics studies, the application of the proposed device in cryogenic memory technology and quantum computing warrant further exploration.

Title: Higher-Form Anomalies on Lattices
Authors: Yitao Feng, Ryohei Kobayashi, Yu-An Chen, Shinsei Ryu
Abstract: Higher-form symmetry in a tensor product Hilbert space is always emergent: the symmetry generators become genuinely topological only when the Gauss law is energetically enforced at low energies. In this paper, we present a general method for defining the 't Hooft anomaly of higher-form symmetries in lattice models built on a tensor product Hilbert space. In (2+1)D, for given Gauss law operators realized by finite-depth circuits that generate a finite 1-form $G$ symmetry, we construct an index representing a cohomology class in $H^4(B^2G, U(1))$, which characterizes the corresponding 't Hooft anomaly. This construction generalizes the Else-Nayak characterization of 0-form symmetry anomalies. More broadly, under the assumption of a specified formulation of the $p$-form $G$ symmetry action and Hilbert space structure in arbitrary $d$ spatial dimensions, we show how to characterize the 't Hooft anomaly of the symmetry action by an index valued in $H^{d+2}(B^{p+1}G, U(1))$.

Title: Antiferromagnetism and Stripe Channel Order in the $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-Symmetric Two-Channel Kondo Lattice Model
Authors: Elyasaf Y. Cohen, Fakher F. Assaad, Snir Gazit
Abstract: We carry out large-scale, sign-problem-free determinant quantum Monte Carlo simulations of the square lattice $\mathrm{SU}(N)$-symmetric two-channel Kondo lattice model at half-filling. We map out the zero-temperature phase diagram for $N = 2, 4, 6$, and $8$, as a function of the Kondo coupling strength. In the weak-coupling regime, we observe antiferromagnetic order of the localized moments. Remarkably, for $N \geq 6$, sufficiently strong Kondo coupling induces spontaneous channel symmetry breaking, forming a stripe dimerization pattern with a wave vector $\boldsymbol{k}=(\pi,0)$ alternating between channels. These findings are supported by a complementary large-$N$ saddle point analysis, which identifies the striped hybridization pattern as the energetically preferred configuration. The spatial symmetry-breaking results in an anisotropic Fermi surface reconstruction.

Title: Putting a new spin on the incommensurate Kekulé spiral: from spin-valley locking and collective modes to fermiology and implications for superconductivity
Authors: Ziwei Wang, Glenn Wagner, Yves H. Kwan, Nick Bultinck, Steven H. Simon, S.A. Parameswaran
Abstract: We revisit the global phase diagram of magic-angle twisted bilayer and [symmetric] trilayer graphene (MA-TBG/TSTG) in light of recent scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) measurements on these materials. These experiments both confirmed the importance of strain in stabilizing the predicted incommensurate Kekulé spiral (IKS) order near filling $|\nu|=2$ of the weakly dispersive central bands in both systems, and suggested a key role for electron-phonon couplings and short-range Coulomb interactions in selecting between various competing orders at low strain in MA-TBG. Here, we show that such interactions $\textit{also}$ play a crucial role in selecting the spin structure of the strain-stabilized IKS state. This in turn influences the visibility of the IKS order in STM in a manner that allows us to infer their relative importance. We use this insight in conjunction with various other pieces of experimental data to build a more complete picture of the phase diagram, focusing on the spectrum of low-lying collective modes and the nature of the doped Fermi surfaces. We explore the broad phenomenological implications of these results for superconductivity.

Title: Driven-Dissipative Landau Polaritons: Two Highly Nonlinearly-Coupled Quantum Harmonic Oscillators
Authors: Farokh Mivehvar
Abstract: Landau levels (LLs) are the massively-degenerate discrete energy spectrum of a charged particle in a transverse magnetic field and lie at the heart of many intriguing phenomena such as the integer and fractional quantum Hall effects as well as quantized vortices. In this Letter, we consider coupling of LLs of a transversely driven charge neutral particle in a synthetic gauge potential to a quantized field of an optical cavity -- a setting reminiscent of superradiant self-ordering setups in quantum gases. We uncover that this complex system can be surprisingly described in terms of two highly nonlinearly-coupled quantum harmonic oscillators, thus enabling a full quantum mechanical treatment. Light-matter coupling mixes the LLs and the superradiant photonic mode, leading to the formation of hybrid states referred to as ``Landau polaritons''. They inherit partially the degeneracy of the LLs and possess intriguing features such as non-zero light-matter entanglement and quadrature squeezing. Depending on the system parameters and the choice of initial state, the system exhibits diverse nonequilibrium quantum dynamics and multiple steady states, with distinct physical properties. This work lays the foundation for further investigating the novel, driven-dissipative Landau-polariton physics in quantum-gas--cavity-QED settings.

Title: A graphical diagnostic of topological order using ZX calculus
Authors: Sergi Mas-Mendoza, Richard D. P. East, Michele Filippone, Adolfo G. Grushin
Abstract: Establishing a universal diagnostic of topological order remains an open theoretical challenge. In particular, diagnosing long-range entanglement through the entropic area law suffers from spurious contributions, failing to unambiguously identify topological order. Here we devise a protocol based on the ZX calculus, a graphical tensor network, to determine the topological order of a state circumventing entropy calculations. The protocol takes as input real-space bipartitions of a state and returns a ZX contour diagram, $\mathcal{D}_{\partial A}$, displaying long-range graph connectivity only for long-range entangled states. We validate the protocol by showing that the contour diagrams of the toric and color codes are equivalent except for the number of non-local nodes, which differentiates their topological order. The number of these nodes is robust to the choice of the boundary and ground-state superposition, and they are absent for trivial states, even those with spurious entropy contributions. Our results single out ZX calculus as a tool to detect topological long-range entanglement by leveraging the advantages of diagrammatic reasoning against entropic diagnostics.

Title: Topological Phase Diagram of Generalized SSH Models with Interactions
Authors: Yuxiao Hang, Stephan Haas
Abstract: We investigate interacting Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains with two- and three-site unit cells using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations. By selecting appropriate filling fractions and sweeping across interaction strength \( J_z \) and dimerization \( \delta \), we map out their phase diagrams and identify transition lines via entanglement entropy and magnetization measurements. In the two-site model, we observe the emergence of an interaction-induced antiferromagnetic intermediate phase between the topologically trivial and non-trivial regimes, as well as a critical region at negative \( J_z \) with suppressed magnetization and finite-size scaling of entanglement entropy. In contrast, the three-site model lacks an intermediate phase and exhibits asymmetric edge localization and antiferromagnetic ordering in both positive and negative \( J_z \) regimes. We further examine the response of edge states to Ising perturbations. In the two-site model, zero-energy edge modes are topologically protected and remain robust up to a finite interaction strength. However, in the three-site model, where the edge states reside at finite energy, this protection breaks down. Despite this, the edge-localized nature of these states survives in the form of polarized modes whose spatial profiles reflect the non-interacting limit.

Title: Reduced Order Modeling of Energetic Materials Using Physics-Aware Recurrent Convolutional Neural Networks in a Latent Space (LatentPARC)
Authors: Zoë J. Gray, Joseph B. Choi, Youngsoo Choi, H. Keo Springer, H. S. Udaykumar, Stephen S. Baek
Abstract: Physics-aware deep learning (PADL) has gained popularity for use in complex spatiotemporal dynamics (field evolution) simulations, such as those that arise frequently in computational modeling of energetic materials (EM). Here, we show that the challenge PADL methods face while learning complex field evolution problems can be simplified and accelerated by decoupling it into two tasks: learning complex geometric features in evolving fields and modeling dynamics over these features in a lower dimensional feature space. To accomplish this, we build upon our previous work on physics-aware recurrent convolutions (PARC). PARC embeds knowledge of underlying physics into its neural network architecture for more robust and accurate prediction of evolving physical fields. PARC was shown to effectively learn complex nonlinear features such as the formation of hotspots and coupled shock fronts in various initiation scenarios of EMs, as a function of microstructures, serving effectively as a microstructure-aware burn model. In this work, we further accelerate PARC and reduce its computational cost by projecting the original dynamics onto a lower-dimensional invariant manifold, or 'latent space.' The projected latent representation encodes the complex geometry of evolving fields (e.g. temperature and pressure) in a set of data-driven features. The reduced dimension of this latent space allows us to learn the dynamics during the initiation of EM with a lighter and more efficient model. We observe a significant decrease in training and inference time while maintaining results comparable to PARC at inference. This work takes steps towards enabling rapid prediction of EM thermomechanics at larger scales and characterization of EM structure-property-performance linkages at a full application scale.

Title: An Assembly-Line Mechanism for In-Vitro Encapsulation of Fragmented Cargo in Virus-Like Particles
Authors: Ayesha Amjad, Irina Tsvetkova, Lena G. Lowry, David Gene Morgan, Roya Zandi, Paul van der Schoot, Bogdan Dragnea
Abstract: The ability of virus shells to encapsulate a wide range of functional cargoes, especially multiple cargoes - siRNAs, enzymes, and chromophores - has made them an essential tool in biotechnology for advancing drug delivery applications and developing innovative new materials. Here we present a mechanistic study of the processes and pathways that lead to multiple cargo encapsulation in the co-assembly of virus shell proteins with ligand-coated nanoparticles. Based on the structural identification of different intermediates, enabled by the contrast in electron microscopy provided by the metal nanoparticles that play the cargo role, we find that multiple cargo encapsulation occurs by self-assembly via a specific ``assembly line'' pathway that is different from previously described \emph{in vitro} assembly mechanisms of virus-like particles (VLP). The emerging model explains observations that are potentially important for delivery applications, for instance, the pronounced nanoparticle size selectivity.

Title: Neural-Quantum-States Impurity Solver for Quantum Embedding Problems
Authors: Yinzhanghao Zhou, Tsung-Han Lee, Ao Chen, Nicola Lanatà, Hong Guo
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) have emerged as a promising approach to solve second-quantised Hamiltonians, because of their scalability and flexibility. In this work, we design and benchmark an NQS impurity solver for the quantum embedding methods, focusing on the ghost Gutzwiller Approximation (gGA) framework. We introduce a graph transformer-based NQS framework able to represent arbitrarily connected impurity orbitals and develop an error control mechanism to stabilise iterative updates throughout the quantum embedding loops. We validate the accuracy of our approach with benchmark gGA calculations of the Anderson Lattice Model, yielding results in excellent agreement with the exact diagonalisation impurity solver. Finally, our analysis of the computational budget reveals the method's principal bottleneck to be the high-accuracy sampling of physical observables required by the embedding loop, rather than the NQS variational optimisation, directly highlighting the critical need for more efficient inference techniques.

Title: Skeletal editing by tip-induced chemistry
Authors: Shantanu Mishra, Valentina Malave, Rasmus Svensson, Henrik Grönbeck, Florian Albrecht, Diego Peña, Leo Gross
Abstract: Skeletal editing of cyclic molecules has garnered considerable attention in the context of drug discovery and green chemistry, with notable examples in solution-phase synthesis. Here, we extend the scope of skeletal editing to the single-molecule scale. We demonstrate tip-induced oxygen deletion and ring contraction of an oxygen-containing seven-membered ring on bilayer NaCl films to generate molecules containing the perylene skeleton. The products were identified and characterized by atomic force and scanning tunneling microscopies, which provided access to bond-resolved molecular structures and orbital densities. Insights into the reaction mechanisms were obtained by density functional theory calculations. Our work expands the toolbox of tip-induced chemistry for single-molecule synthesis.

Title: Spectral Analysis of Light Interstitial Segregation Energies in Ni: The Role of Local Cr Coordination for Boron and Carbon
Authors: Tyler D. Doležal, Rodrigo Freitas, Ju Li
Abstract: Understanding interstitial segregation in chemically complex alloys requires accounting for chemical and structural heterogeneity of interfaces, motivating approaches that move beyond scalar descriptors to capture the full spatial and compositional spectra of segregation behavior. Here, we introduce a spectral segregation framework that maps distributions of segregation energies for light interstitials in Ni as a function of local Cr coordination. Boron exhibits a broad, rugged energy spectrum with significant positional flexibility whereas carbon remains confined to a narrow spectrum with minimal displacement. At the free surface, Cr-rich coordination destabilizes both interstitials (e.g., positive segregation energies), in sharp contrast to the stabilizing role of Cr at the GB. This inversion establishes a natural segregation gradient that drives interstitials away from undercoordinated internal surfaces and toward GBs. These results underscore the limitations of single-valued segregation descriptors and demonstrate how a distributional approach reveals the mechanistic origins of interstitial--interface interactions in chemically heterogeneous alloys.

Title: Multi-Dimensional Photon-Correlations Reveal Triexciton Features in Single Perovskite Quantum Dots
Authors: Alex Hinkle, Chieh Tsao, Adam Duell, Hendrik Utzat
Abstract: Lead-halide perovskite quantum dots (PQDs) are established quantum emitters with potential for entangled photon-pair generation via multiexciton cascades. However, the energetics and dynamics of many-body excitations remain poorly understood. Here, we perform time- and frequency-resolved photon-correlation spectroscopy of single CsPbBr\textsubscript{3} PQDs at low temperatures using a single-photon avalanche diode (SPAD) array detector. We report biexciton binding energies and assign their charged states, which undergo fast ($\mu$s) switching dynamics. Most notably, we identify a spectral feature blue-shifted from the exciton by $7.4 \pm 1.9$ meV as the bound triexciton and establish the order of its cascade emission. These results highlight the power of low-temperature, multidimensional photon-correlation spectroscopy for resolving complex many-body dynamics.

Title: Topological Phononic Crystal on the Scale of Quasi-Ballistic Phonon Transport
Authors: Keita Funayama, Yuki Akura, Hiroya Tanaka, Jun Hirotani
Abstract: Phonon engineering technology has opened up the functional thermal management of semiconductor-based classical and quantum electronics at the micro- and nanoscales. However, challenges have remained in designing accurate thermal characteristics based on quasi-ballistic phonon transport. The quasi-ballistic thermal transport arises from the combination of wave-like and diffusive phonon behaviors unlike pure diffusion. The topological nature has been known to be compatible with both wave and diffusive phenomena. Therefore, topological phononic crystals have great potential for the development of controllable and designable thermal transport based on quasi-ballistic phonons. In this study, we experimentally investigated the thermal behavior at the scale of quasi-ballistic phonon transport using a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model-based topological phononic crystal. Quasi-ballistic phonon transport was observed through change in thermal conductivity depending on the structural parameters of topological systems using micro-thermoreflectance. Furthermore, using topological interface states, the experimentally observed thermal behaviors were found to agree well with the theoretically expected those. Accordingly, the topological nature is an effective approach for thermal management in micro- and nanoscale systems with quasi-ballistic phonon transport. Our results pave the way for a unified control scheme for wave and diffusion phenomena, such as quasi-ballistic phonons.

Title: Reentrant localization in fractionally charged electron wave packets
Authors: Y. Yin
Abstract: We investigate the localization transition in fractionally charged electron wave packets, which is injected into a quantum conductor by a single voltage pulse with arbitrary flux quantum. We show that the transition is unidirectional for individual electrons or holes. They always undergo a delocalization-to-localization transition as the flux increases. In contrast, the transition of the neutral electron-hole pairs is bidirectional. As the flux increases, the transition can be a localization-to-delocalization transition or vice versa, which is controlled via the long-time tail of the voltage pulse. The localization-to-delocalization transition occurs in the case of short-tailed pulses, which decay faster than Lorentzian. In this case, the directions of the transitions for the neutral eh pairs and individual electrons or holes are opposite. Certain localized neutral electron-hole pairs can first evolve into delocalized ones, then split into individual electrons and holes with localized wave functions, which gives a reentrant localization. The delocalization-to-localization transition occurs in the case of long-tailed pulses, which decay slower than Lorentzian. The reentrant localization vanishes in this case, as the directions of the two transitions are the same. It is also absent in the case of Lorentzian pulses, where the localized neutral electron-hole pairs cannot be excited at all.

Title: Coupled Infrared Imaging and Multiphysics Modeling to Predict Three-Dimensional Thermal Characteristics during Selective Laser Melting
Authors: Vijay Kumar, Kaitlyn M. Mullin, Hyunggon Park, Matthew Gerigk, Andrew Bresk, Tresa M. Pollock, Yangying Zhu
Abstract: Laser heating during additive manufacturing (AM) induces extreme and transient thermal conditions which critically influence the microstructure evolution and mechanical properties of the resulting component. However, accurately resolving these conditions with sufficient spatiotemporal accuracy remains a central challenge. We demonstrate a unique approach that couples high-speed infrared imaging, during selective laser melting of MAR-M247, with a transient three-dimensional (3D) multiphysics simulation to reconstruct the dynamic sub-surface temperature distribution of the melt pool. This integrated framework enables the estimation of experimentally-validated, 3D solidification conditions-including solidification velocities and cooling rates-at the solid-liquid interface while also significantly lowering computational cost. By quantifying solidification conditions, we predict variations in microstructure size and orientation driven by laser processing parameters and validate them with ex situ scanning electron microscopy and electron backscatter diffraction maps. Our findings substantiate that an integrated experimental-computational approach is crucial to realize in situ prediction and optimization of microstructures in commercial AM.

Title: High-pressure electronic states in semiconductors studied by infrared spectroscopy: metallization and band gap tuning in Mg$_2$Si, InAs and InSb
Authors: Hidekazu Okamura, Haruna Okazaki, Katsunori Marugaku, Subin Lee, Tomoki Yoneda, Haruhiko Udono, Yoshihisa Mori, Mitsuhiko Maesato, Hiroshi Kitagawa, Yuka Ikemoto, Taro Moriwaki
Abstract: In this article, a brief introduction is first given on infrared studies of materials at high pressures using a diamond anvil cell. Then, our recent results of high-pressure infrared studies are described for Mg$_2$Si, InAs, and InSb. For Mg$_2$Si, pressure-induced metallization at pressures near 10 GPa were clearly demonstrated for both carrier-doped and undoped Mg$_2$Si by large increases of reflectivity. For InAs and InSb, their band gap ($E_g$) increased rapidly and almost linearly with pressure with linear coefficients of $dE_g/dP$=84.6 and 112 meV/GPa, respectively. Obtained values of $E_g$ versus lattice parameter at high pressures are compared with those for other IIl-V semiconductors at ambient pressure, giving unique insight into effects of physical and chemical pressures on $E_g$. Above the structural transition pressures of 7 and 3 GPa for InAs and InSb, respectively, they exhibit highly metallic characteristics accompanied by high reflectivity.

Title: Particle-hole symmetry in the pseudogap phase of moderately underdoped cuprate high temperature superconductors evidenced from joint density of states analysis
Authors: Niraj Kumar Shah, Junjing Zhao, Utpal Chatterjee
Abstract: In conventional superconductors, the energy scale associated with the superfluid stiffness is much larger compared to the pairing energy and hence, the superconducting transition temperature (Tc) is entirely dictated by the superconducting (SC) energy gap. The phase rigidity of the SC condensate in unconventional superconductors, on the other hand, can be low enough to enable destruction of superconductivity via phase incoherence and persistence of an energy gap even at the absence of macroscopic superconductivity above Tc. This is considered a possible mechanism of the pseudogap (PG) state of cuprate high temperature superconductors (HTSCs). We have investigated the electronic energy ({\omega}) and momentum-separation vector (q) dependence of the joint density of states (JDOS), derived from the autocorrelated Angle Resolved Photoemission Spectroscopy (ARPES) data, from moderately underdoped Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8+{\delta}HTSC samples at temperatures below and above Tc. We found that q-space structure of the constant {\omega} JDOS intensity maps and the dispersions of the JDOS peaks are essentially the same both below and above Tc. Furthermore, the dispersions of the JDOS peaks above Tc are particle-hole symmetric. These observations evince similarity between the nature of the energy gap below and above Tc, which supports preformed pairing scenario for the PG state at least in the moderately underdoped regime.

Title: Anomalous statistics in the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity: from Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion to anomalous diffusion and ergodicity breaking
Authors: Takuma Akimoto, Jae-Hyung Jeon, Ralf Metzler, Tomoshige Miyaguchi, Takashi Uneyama, Eiji Yamamoto
Abstract: Diffusive motion is a fundamental transport mechanism in physical and biological systems, governing dynamics across a wide range of scales -- from molecular transport to animal foraging. In many complex systems, however, diffusion deviates from classical Brownian behaviour, exhibiting striking phenomena such as Brownian yet non-Gaussian diffusion (BYNGD) and anomalous diffusion. BYNGD describes a frequently observed statistical feature characterised by the coexistence of linear mean-square displacement (MSD) and non-Gaussian displacement distributions. Anomalous diffusion, in contrast, involves a nonlinear time dependence of the MSD and often reflects mechanisms such as trapping, viscoelasticity, heterogeneity, or active processes. Both phenomena challenge the conventional framework based on constant diffusivity and Gaussian statistics. This review focuses the theoretical modelling of such behaviour via the Langevin equation with fluctuating diffusivity (LEFD) -- a flexible stochastic framework that captures essential features of diffusion in heterogeneous media. LEFD not only accounts for BYNGD but also naturally encompasses a wide range of anomalous transport phenomena, including subdiffusion, ageing, and weak ergodicity breaking. Ergodicity is discussed in terms of the correspondence between time and ensemble averages, as well as the trajectory-to-trajectory variability of time-averaged observables. The review further highlights the empirical relevance of LEFD and related models in explaining diverse experimental observations and underscores their value to uncovering the physical mechanisms governing transport in complex systems.

Title: Quantum Otto heat engine and quantum Mpemba effect in quasiperiodic systems
Authors: Ao Zhou, Feng Lu, Shujie Cheng, Gao Xianlong
Abstract: In this paper, a quasiperiodic system with off-diagonal and diagonal modulations is studied. By analyzing the inverse participation ratio and the centroid position of the wave packet, the delocalization-localization phase diagrams in the equilibrium state and the non-equilibrium steady state are obtained respectively. The stability of the system's initial state on dissipation and the dissipation-driven delocalization-localization transition (or vice versa) are discussed. The dynamic evolution behavior provides evidence for the existence of the quantum Mpemba effect in this dissipation-modulated system. A starting-line hypothesis is proposed, which can be used to explain the occurrence and absence of the quantum Mpemba effect. In addition, the thermodynamic applications of this system have also been studied. The results prove that the localized phase is beneficial to the realization of quantum heater as well. Our work has promoted the understanding of the steady-state phase transitions and dynamic behaviors of dissipation-modulated quasiperiodic systems, and has expanded the existing thermodynamic research on the application of quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Over One Order of Magnitude Enhancement in Hole Mobility of 2D III-V Semiconductors through Valence Band Edge Shift
Authors: Jianshi Sun, Shouhang Li, Cheng Shao, Zhen Tong, Meng An, Yue Hu, Xiongfei Zhu, Thomas Frauenheim, Xiangjun Liu
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) semiconductors show great potential to sustain Moore's law in the era of ultra-scaled electronics. However, their scalable applications are severely constrained by low hole mobility. In this work, we take 2D-GaAs as a prototype of III-V semiconductors to investigate the effects of quantum anharmonicity (QA) on hole transport, employing the stochastic self-consistent harmonic approximation assisted by the machine learning potential. It is found that the room-temperature hole mobility of 2D-GaAs is reduced by $\sim$44% as the QA effects are incorporated, which is attributed to the enhanced electron-phonon scattering from the out-of-plane acoustic polarization. The valence band edge shift (VBES) strategy is proposed to increase the hole mobility by $\sim$1600% at room temperature, which can be realized by 1% biaxial compressive strain. The electron-phonon scattering rate is dramatically decreased due to the full filtering of the original interband electron-phonon scattering channels that existed in the flat hole pocket. The VBES strategy can be further extended to other 2D III-V semiconductors to promote their hole mobilities.

Title: Revealing superconducting gap in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$δ$ by Andreev reflection spectroscopy under high pressure
Authors: Jianning Guo, Yuzhi Chen, Yulong Wang, Hualei Sun, Deyuan Hu, Meng Wang, Xiaoli Huang, Tian Cui
Abstract: The recent discovery of compressed superconductivity at 80~K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ has brought nickelates into the family of unconventional high-temperature superconductors. However, due to the challenges of directly probing the superconducting pairing mechanism under high pressure, the pairing symmetry and gap structures of nickelate superconductors remain under intense debate. In this work, we successfully determine the microscopic information on the superconducting gap structure of La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-$\delta$ samples subjected to pressures exceeding 20~GPa, by constructing different conductance junctions within diamond anvil cells. By analyzing the temperature-dependent differential conductance spectra within the Blonder--Tinkham--Klapwijk (BTK) model, we have determined the superconducting energy gap at high pressure. The differential conductance curves reveal a two-gap structure with $\Delta_{1} = 23~\mathrm{meV}$ and $\Delta_{2} = 6~\mathrm{meV}$, while the BTK fitting is consistent with an $s$-like, two-gap spectrum. The gap ratio $2\Delta_{s1}(0) / k_{\mathrm{B}}T_{c}$ is found to be 7.61, belonging to a family of strongly coupled superconductors. Our findings provide valuable insights into the superconducting gap structures of the pressure-induced superconducting nickelates.

Title: Direct Observation of d-Wave Superconducting Gap Symmetry in Pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta Single Crystals

Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressure-stabilized bulk La3Ni2O7-delta, with a critical temperature (Tc) exceeding 77 K, has opened a new frontier in high-temperature superconductivity research beyond cuprates. Yet, the superconducting gap amplitude and symmetry, the key parameters to characterize a superconductor, remain elusive due to the overwhelming challenges of gap studies under high pressure. Here, we introduce in situ directional point-contact spectroscopy conducted under truly hydrostatic pressure, enabling the direct mapping of the superconducting gap in pressurized La3Ni2O7-delta single crystals. Depending on the junction orientation, differential conductance (dI/dV) spectra exhibit distinct V-shaped quasiparticle features and a sharp zero-bias peak, indicating a predominant d-wave-like pairing symmetry. Measurement of the c-axis gap amplitude Delta yields a gap-to-Tc ratio of 2Delta/kBTc = 4.2(5), positioning La3Ni2O7-delta firmly among unconventional, nodal high-Tc superconductors. These findings set stringent constraints on theoretical models for nickelate superconductors and establish a robust spectroscopic approach for understanding superconductors under extreme pressures.

Title: Symmetry and Topology of Successive Quantum Feedback Control
Authors: Junxuan Wen, Zongping Gong, Takahiro Sagawa
Abstract: We establish a symmetry classification for a general class of quantum feedback control. For successive feedback control with a non-adaptive sequence of bare measurements (i.e., with positive Kraus operators), we prove that the symmetry classification collapses to the ten-fold AZ$^\dagger$ classes, specifying the allowed topology of CPTP maps associated with feedback control. We demonstrate that a chiral Maxwell's demon with Gaussian measurement errors exhibits quantized winding numbers. Moreover, for general (non-bare) measurements, we explicitly construct a protocol that falls outside the ten-fold classification. These results broaden and clarify the principles in engineering topological aspects of quantum control robust against disorder and imperfections.

Title: Nambu Non-equilibrium Thermodynamics III: Application to specific phenomena
Authors: So Katagiri, Yoshiki Matsuoka, Akio Sugamoto
Abstract: We apply Nambu non-equilibrium thermodynamics (NNET)-a dynamics with multiple Hamiltonians coupled to entropy-induced dissipation-to paradigmatic far-from-equilibrium systems. Concretely, we construct NNET realizations for the Belousov-Zhabotinsky (BZ) reaction (oscillatory), the Hindmarsh-Rose neuron model (spiking), and the Lorenz and Chen systems (chaotic), and analyze their dynamical and thermodynamic signatures. Across all cases the velocity field cleanly decomposes into a reversible Nambu part and an irreversible entropygradient part, anchored by a model-independent quasi-conserved quantity. This construction reproduces cycles, spikes, and strange-attractor behavior and clarifies transitions among steady, periodic, and chaotic regimes via cross-model diagnostics. These results demonstrate that NNET provides a unified, quantitatively consistent framework for oscillatory, spiking, and chaotic non-equilibrium systems, offering a systematic description beyond the scope of linear-response theories such as Onsager's relations or GENERIC.

Title: Atomic-scale phase-field modeling with universal machine learning potentials
Authors: Kairi Masuda, Yu Kumagai
Abstract: Atomic-scale phase-field modeling formulates the probability densities of atomic vibrations as Gaussian distributions and derives a free energy functional using variational Gaussian theory and interatomic potentials. This framework permits per-Gaussian decomposition of the free energy, providing a description of local thermodynamic states with atomic resolution. However, existing formulations are limited to classical pairwise interatomic potentials, restricting their applicability to specific materials and compromising quantitative accuracy. In this work, we extend the atomic-scale phase-field methodology by incorporating universal machine learning interatomic potentials, thereby generalizing the free energy functional to many-body systems. This extension enhances both the accuracy and transferability of the approach. We demonstrate the method by applying it to bulk copper under NVT and NPT ensembles, where the predicted pressures and equilibrium lattice constants show excellent agreement with molecular dynamics simulations, validating the theoretical framework. Furthermore, we apply the method to {\Sigma}5(310)[001] grain boundaries in copper, enabling the visualization of local free energy distributions with atomic-scale resolution. The results reveal a pronounced free energy concentration at the grain boundary core, capturing the thermodynamic signature of the interface. This study establishes a versatile and accurate framework for atomic-scale thermodynamic modeling, significantly broadening the scope of phase-field approaches to include complex materials and defect structures.

Title: Anomalous inverse Faraday effect for graphene quantum dots in optical vortices
Authors: Zi-Yang Xu, Wei E. I. Sha, Hang Xie
Abstract: Chiral photon interactions with two-dimensional (2D) materials enable unprecedented control of quantum phenomena. In this paper, we report anomalous inverse Faraday effects (IFE) in graphene quantum dots (GQDs) under linearly polarized optical vortex illumination, where transferred orbital angular momentum (OAM) generates light-induced magnetic moments. Employing our recently developed time-dependent quantum perturbation framework [Phys. Rev. B 110, 085425 (2024)], we demonstrate a counterintuitive observation: some reversed magnetic moments at off-axis positions occur-manifested as counter-rotating currents to the vortex helical wavefront. Phase-difference analysis and eigenmode decomposition resolve this anomaly, revealing that the OAM transfer efficiency is orders of magnitude weaker than its spin counterpart. This work establishes a new paradigm for optical OAM-to-magnetization conversion in quantum-engineered 2D systems.

Title: Systematic Schrieffer-Wolff-transformation approach to Josephson junctions: quasiparticle effects and Josephson harmonics

Abstract: We use the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation (SWT) to analyze Josephson junctions between superconducting leads described by the charge-conserving BCS theory. Starting from the single-electron tunneling terms, we directly recover the conventional effective Hamiltonian, $-E_J\cos\hat{\varphi}$, with an operator-valued phase bias $\hat{\varphi}$. The SWT approach has the advantage that it can be systematically extended to more complex scenarios. We show that if a Bogoliubov quasiparticle is present its motion couples to that of Cooper pairs, introducing correlated dynamics that reshape the energy spectrum of the junction. Furthermore, higher-order terms in the SWT naturally describe Josephson harmonics, whose amplitudes are directly related to the microscopic properties of the superconducting leads and the junction. We derive expressions that could facilitate tuning the ratio between the different harmonics in a controlled way.

Title: Ginzburg-Landau Formalism in Curved Spacetime
Authors: Mohammad Amin Rastkhadiv
Abstract: Recent researches on tilted Dirac cone materials have unveiled an astonishing property, the metric of the spacetime can be altered in these materials by applying a perpendicular electric field. This phenomenon is observed near the Fermi velocity, which is significantly lower than the speed of light. According to this property, we derive the Ginzburg-Landau action from the microscopic Hamiltonian of the BCS theory for the tilted Dirac cone materials. This derivation is performed near the critical point within the framework of curved spacetime. The novelty of the present work lies in deriving a general Ginzburg-Landau action that depends on spacetime curvature, where the curvature is tuned by an external electric field. Furthermore, this finding enables us to apply the Ginzburg-Landau theory at high temperatures by changing the spacetime metric, potentially offering insights into achieving high-temperature superconductivity in these materials.

Title: The self-assembly behavior of a diblock copolymer/homopolymer induced by Janus nanorods
Authors: Y. Q. Guo, J. Liu, H. R. He, N. Wu, J. J. Zhang
Abstract: We employ cell dynamics simulation based on the CH/BD model to investigate the self-assembly behavior of a mixed system consisting of diblock copolymers (AB), homopolymers (C), and Janus nanorods. The results indicate that, at different component ratios, the mixed system undergoes various phase transitions with an increasing number of nanorods. Specifically, when the homopolymer component is 0.40, the mixed system transitions from a disordered structure to a parallel lamellar structure, subsequently to a tilted layered structure, and ultimately to a perpendicular lamellar structure as the number of nanorods increases. To explore this phenomenon in greater depth, we conduct a comprehensive analysis of domain sizes and pattern evolution. Additionally, we investigate the effects of the repulsive interaction strength between polymers, wetting strength, length of nanorods, and degree of asymmetry on the self-assembly behavior of the mixed system. This research provides significant theoretical and experimental insights for the preparation of novel nanomaterials.

Title: Algebraic solution and thermodynamic properties of graphene in the presence of minimal length
Authors: J. Gbètoho, F. A. Dossa, G. Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: Graphene is a zero-gap semiconductor, where the electrons propagating inside are described by the ultra-relativistic Dirac equation normally reserved for very high energy massless particles. In this work, we show that graphene under a magnetic field in the presence of a minimal length has a hidden $su(1,1)$ symmetry. This symmetry allows us to construct the spectrum algebraically. In fact, a generalized uncertainty relation, leading to a non-zero minimum uncertainty on the position, would be closer to physical reality and allow us to control or create bound states in graphene. Using the partition function based on the Epstein zeta function, the thermodynamic properties are well determined. We find that the Dulong-Petit law is verified and the heat capacity is independent of the deformation parameter.

Title: Thermodynamic relation for the systems with inhomogeneous distribution of particles
Authors: A. P. Rebesh, B. I. Lev, A. G. Zagorodny
Abstract: For the system with inhomogeneous distribution of macroscopic parameters we obtain thermodynamic relation which depends on the spatial point (coordinate). In our approach, to obtain such a relation we use the basic ideas of the method of nonequilibrium statistical operator combined with the Hubbard-Stratonovich transformation. First of all, we define the thermodynamic relation for the system with homogeneous distribution of particles. Possible behavior peculiarities of systems with different character of interaction in nonequilibrium case are predicted. By saddle-point method we find the dominant contributions to the partition function and obtain all thermodynamic parameters of the systems with different character of interaction. The formations of saddle state in all systems of interacting particles at different temperatures and particle distributions have the same physical nature and therefore they can be described in the same way. We consider the systems with attractive and repulsive interactions as well as self-gravitating systems.

Title: Quintuplet condensation in the skyrmionic insulator Cu2OSeO3 at ultrahigh magnetic fields
Authors: T. Nomura, I. Rousochatzakis, O. Janson, M. Gen, X.-G. Zhou, Y. Ishii, S. Seki, Y. Kohama, Y. H. Matsuda
Abstract: We report ultrahigh magnetic field Faraday rotation results on the chiral helimagnet Cu2OSeO3, the first Mott insulator showing skyrmion lattice phases and a linear magnetoelectric effect. Between 180 and 300 T, we find signatures of a Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) of magnons, which can be described as a canted XY ferrimagnet. Due to the magnetoelectric coupling, the transverse magnetic order of the indivual Cu2+ spins is accompanied by a characteristic dome-like electric polarization which is crucial for the observation of the condensate via the Faraday rotation effect.

Title: Beyond conventional half-metals: gapless states and spin gapless semiconducting behavior in X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) Heusler compounds
Authors: N. Bouteldja, N. Hacini, I. Ouadha, H. Rached
Abstract: The search for high-performance spintronic materials motivates the exploration of Heusler alloys with unconventional electronic properties. Using density functional theory with Hubbard correction (DFT+$U$, $U = 4$~eV), we investigate X$_2$MnGa (X = Ti, Ir) alloys, which stabilize in the ferromagnetic L2$_1$-type structure with strong thermodynamic stability. Electronic structure calculations reveal contrasting behaviors: Ti$_2$MnGa transitions from a metallic L2$_1$-type phase to a spin gapless semiconductor (SGS) in the XA-type, while Ir$_2$MnGa exhibits gapless half-metallicity behavior in the L2$_1$-type but becomes half-metallic in the XA-type. The magnetic properties are governed by spd hybridization between Mn-3$d$ and X-$d$/Ga-$p$ states, which stabilizes ferromagnetism and tailors electronic states near the Fermi level. The Hubbard $U$ correction proves essential for accurately describing the correlated Mn-3$d$ electrons. These alloys combine structural stability with tunable electronic and magnetic properties, offering a promising platform for spin-polarized transport in next-generation spintronic devices.

Title: Sources of nonlinearity in the response of a driven nano-electromechanical resonator
Authors: Sofia Sevitz, Kushagra Aggarwal, Jorge Tabanera-Bravo, Juliette Monsel, Florian Vigneau, Federico Fedele, Joe Dunlop, Juan M.R. Parrondo, Gerard J. Milburn, Janet Anders, Natalia Ares, Federico Cerisola
Abstract: Nanoelectromechanical resonators provide an ideal platform for investigating the interplay between electron transport and nonlinear mechanical motion. Externally driven suspended carbon nanotubes, containing an electrostatically defined quantum dot are especially promising. These devices possess two main sources of nonlinearity: the electromechanical coupling and the intrinsic contributions of the resonator that induce a Duffing-like nonlinear behavior. In this work, we observe the interplay between the two sources across different driving regimes. The main nonlinear feature we observe is the emergence of arch-like resonances in the electronic transport when the resonator is strongly driven. We show that our model is in good agreement with our experimental electron transport measurements on a suspended carbon nanotube. This characterization paves the way for the exploration of nonlinear phenomena using mesoscopic electromechanical resonators.

Title: Quasi-static shape control of soft, morphing structures
Authors: Eszter Fehér, András Árpád Sipos, Péter Várkonyi
Abstract: Inspired by biological systems, we introduce a general framework for quasi-static shape control of human-scale structures under slowly varying external actions or requirements. In this setting, shape control aims to traverse the stable sub-manifolds of the equilibrium set to meet some predefined requirements or optimization criteria. As finite deformations are allowed, the equilibrium set may have a non-trivial topology. This paper explores the implications of large shape changes and high compliance, such as the emergence of unstable equilibria and equilibrium sets with non-trivial topology. We identify various adaptivity scenarios, ranging from inverse kinematics to optimization and path planning problems, and discuss the role of time-dependent loads and requirements. The applicability of the proposed concepts is demonstrated through the example of a curved Kirchhoff rod that is susceptible to snap-through behavior.

These strategies are compatible with conventional and unconventional substrates, opening up new possibilities for practical implementation. Furthermore, the article highlights the development of novel 2D TMDs with unique functionalities and remarkable chemistry. These advancements contribute to expanding the range of applications and capabilities of TMD materials, pushing the boundaries of what can be achieved with these ultra-thin layers. In addition to electronics, the article delves into the significant efforts dedicated to exploring the potential of 2D TMDs in energy and sensor applications. These materials have shown promising characteristics for energy storage and have been extensively studied for their sensing capabilities, showcasing their versatility and potential impact in these fields. This article provides a comprehensive overview of the recent progress in 2D TMDs, emphasising their applications in electronics, optoelectronics, energy, and sensing.

Title: Structural and Electrocatalytic Properties of La-Co-Ni Oxide Thin Films
Authors: Patrick Marx, Shivam Shukla, Alejandro Esteban Perez Mendoza, Florian Lourens, Corina Andronescu, Alfred Ludwig
Abstract: La-Co-Ni oxides were fabricated in the form of thin-film materials libraries by combinatorial reactive co-sputtering and analyzed for structural and functional properties over large compositional ranges: normalized to the metals of the film they span about 0 - 70 at.-% for Co, 18 - 81 at.-% for La and 11 - 25 at.-% for Ni. Composition-dependent phase analysis shows formation of three areas with different phase constitutions in dependance of Co-content: In the La-rich region with low Co content, a mixture of the phases La2O3, perovskite, and La(OH)3 is observed. In the Co-rich region, perovskite and spinel phases form. Between the three-phase region and the Co-rich two-phase region, a single-phase perovskite region emerges. Surface microstructure analysis shows formation of additional crystallites on the surface in the two-phase area, which become more numerous with increasing Ni-content. Energy-dispersive X-ray analysis indicates that these crystallites mainly contain Co and Ni, so they could be spinels growing on the surface. The analysis of the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) electrocatalytic activity over all compositions and phase constitutions reveals that the perovskite/spinel two-phase region shows the highest catalytic activity, which increases with higher Ni-content. The highest OER current density was measured as 2.24 mA/cm2 at 1.8 V vs. RHE for the composition La11Co20Ni9O60.

Title: Origin of Reverse Size Effect in Ferroelectric Hafnia Thin Films
Authors: Tianyuan Zhu, Shi Liu
Abstract: The persistence of ferroelectricity in ultrathin HfO$_2$ films challenges conventional theories, particularly given the paradoxical observation that the out-of-plane lattice spacing increases with decreasing thickness. We resolve this puzzle by revealing that this anomalous lattice expansion is counterintuitively coupled to suppressed out-of-plane polarization. First-principles calculations combined with analytical modeling identify two mechanisms behind this expansion: a negative longitudinal piezoelectric response to the residual depolarization field and a positive surface stress that becomes significant at reduced thickness. Their interplay quantitatively reproduces the experimentally observed lattice expansion. Furthermore, (111)-oriented HfO$_2$ films can support out-of-plane polarization even under open-circuit conditions, in contrast to (001) films that stabilize a nonpolar ground state. This behavior points to the emergence of orientation-induced hyperferroelectricity, an unrecognized mechanism that enables polarization persistence through orientation engineering without electrode screening. The principle also extends to perovskite ferroelectrics, offering a strategy to eliminate critical thickness limits by selecting appropriate film orientations.

Title: Non-Abelian Gauge Theory of Spin Triplet Superconductivity and Spin Triplet Magnon Spintronics
Authors: Franklin H. Cho, Y.M. Cho, Pengming Zhang, Li-Ping Zou
Abstract: We present an SU(2)xU(1) Ginzburg-Landau theory of the spin triplet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also describe the physics of the spin triplet magnon spintronics, where the SU(2) gauge interaction of the magnon plays an important role. The theory is made of the massive photon, massless neutral magnon, massive non-Abelian magnon, and the Higgs scalar field which represents the density of the Copper pair. It has the following characteristic features, the long range magnetic interaction mediated by the massless magnon, two types of conserved supercurrents (the ordinary electromagnetic current and the spin current made of the magnons) which could explain the conversion between the charge and spin currents, and the non-Abelian Meissner effect generated by the spin current. Moreover, it has non-Abelian topological objects, the quantized non-Abelian magnonic vortex and non-Abelian magnonic monopole, as well as the ordinary Abrikosov vortex. The theory is characterized by three scales. In addition to the correlation length fixed by the mass of the Higgs field it has two different mass scales, the one fixed by the mass of the photon and the other fixed by the mass of the off-diagonal magnon. We compare the theory with the non-Abelian gauge theory of the spin doublet ferromagnetic superconductivity which could also be interpreted as an effective theory of the electron spintronics. We discuss the physical implications of the non-Abelian gauge theories in condensed matter physics.

Title: Structural effects of boron doping in diamond crystals for gamma-ray light-source applications: Insights from molecular dynamics simulations
Authors: Matthew D. Dickers, Felipe Fantuzzi, Nigel J. Mason, Andrei V. Korol, Andrey V. Solov'yov
Abstract: Boron-doped diamond crystals (BDD, C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$) exhibit exceptional mechanical strength, electronic tunability, and resistance to radiation damage. This makes them promising materials for use in gamma-ray crystal-based light sources. To better understand and quantify the structural distortions introduced by doping, which are critical for maintaining channelling efficiency, we perform atomistic-level molecular dynamics simulations on periodic C$_{1-x}$B$_{x}$ systems of various sizes. These simulations allow the influence of boron concentration on the lattice constant and the (110) and (100) inter-planar distances to be evaluated over the concentration range from pure diamond (0%) to 5% boron at room temperature (300 K). Linear relationships between both lattice constant and inter-planar distance with increasing dopant concentration are observed, with a deviation from Vegard's Law. This deviation is larger than that reported by other theoretical and computational studies; however, this may be attributed to an enhanced crystal quality over these studies, a vital aspect when considering gamma-ray crystal light source design. The methodology presented here incorporates several refinements to closely reflect the conditions of microwave plasma chemical vapour deposition (MPCVD) crystal growth. Validation of the methodology is provided through a comprehensive statistical analysis of the structure of our generated crystals. These results enable reliable atomistic modelling of doped diamond crystals and support their use in the design and fabrication of periodically bent structures for next-generation gamma-ray light source technologies.

Title: Nature of the Topological Transition of the Kitaev Model in [111] Magnetic Field
Authors: S. Thiagarajan, C. Watson, T. Yzeiri, H. Hu, B. Uchoa, F. Krüger
Abstract: We investigate the nature of the topological phase transition of the antiferromagnetic Kitaev model on the honeycomb lattice in the presence of a magnetic field along the [111] direction. The field opens a topological gap in the Majorana fermion spectrum and leads to a sequence of topological phase transitions before the field polarised state is reached. At mean field level the gap first closes at the three $M$ points in the Brillouin zone, where the Majorana fermions form Dirac cones, resulting in a change of Chern number by three. An odd number of Dirac fermions in the infrared is unusual and requires Berry curvature compensation in the UV, which occurs via topological, ring-like hybridisation gaps with higher-energy bands. We perform a renormalisation-group analysis of the topological phase transition at the three $M$ points within the Yukawa theory, allowing for intra- and inter-valley fluctuations of the spin-liquid bond operators. We find that the latter lead to a breaking of Lorentz invariance and hence a different universality compared to the standard Ising Gross-Neveu-Yukawa class.

Title: Explaining Principles of Tip-Enhanced Raman Images with Ab Initio Modeling
Authors: Krystof Brezina, Yair Litman, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: Tip-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (TERS) is a powerful method for imaging vibrational motion and chemically characterizing surface-bound systems. Theoretical simulations of TERS images often consider systems in isolation, ignoring any substrate support, such as metallic surfaces. Here, we show that this omission leads to deviations from experimentally measured data through simulations with a new finite-field formulation of first-principles simulation of TERS spectra that can address extended, periodic systems. We show that TERS images of tetracyanoethylene on Ag(100) and defective MoS$_2$ monolayers calculated using isolated molecules or cluster models are qualitatively different from those calculated when accounting for the periodicity of the substrate. For Mg(II)-porphine on Ag(100), a system for which a direct experimental comparison is possible, these simulations prove to be crucial for explaining the spatial variation of TERS intensity patterns and allow us to uncover fundamental principles of TERS spectroscopy. We explain how and why surface interactions affect images of out-of-plane vibrational modes much more than those of in-plane modes, providing an important tool for the future interpretation of these images in more complex systems.

Title: A Self-Organized Model for the Flicker Noise in Interacting Two-Dimensional Electron Gas
Authors: Maryam Pirgholi, Morteza Nattagh Najafi, Vadood Adami
Abstract: We investigate self-organized criticality in a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) by introducing a lattice-based model that incorporates electron-electron interactions through the concept of coherence length. Our numerical simulations demonstrate that in the strongly interacting regime, the system exhibits a distinct set of universal critical exponents, markedly different from those observed in the weakly interacting limit. This dichotomy aligns with experimental findings on the metal-insulator transition in 2DEGs, where high interaction strength (low carrier density) leads to qualitatively different behavior. The analysis includes scaling of the average electron density with temperature, the power spectral density, and the statistics of electronic avalanches - namely their size distributions and autocorrelation functions. In all cases, the extracted exponents differ significantly between the weak and strong interaction regimes, highlighting the emergence of two universality classes governed by interaction strength. These results underscore the critical role of electron correlations in the self-organized behavior of low-dimensional electronic systems.

Title: Dispersion of collective modes in spinful fractional quantum Hall states on the sphere
Authors: Rakesh K. Dora, Ajit C. Balram
Abstract: Collective modes capture the dynamical aspects of fractional quantum Hall (FQH) fluids. Depending on the active degrees of freedom, different types of collective modes can arise in a FQH state. In this work, we consider spinful FQH states in the lowest Landau level (LLL) along the Jain sequence of fillings $\nu{=}n/(2n{\pm}1)$ and compute the Coulomb dispersion of their spin-flip and spin-conserving collective modes in the spherical geometry. We use the LLL-projected density-wave and composite fermion (CF) exciton states as trial wave functions for these modes. To evaluate the dispersion of density-wave states, we derive the commutation algebra of spinful LLL-projected density operators on the sphere, which enables us to extract the gap of the density-wave excitations from the numerically computed density-density correlation function, i.e., the static structure factor, of the FQH ground state. We find that the CF excitons provide an accurate description of the collective modes at all wavelengths, while the density-wave states fail to do so. Specifically, the spin-flip density wave reliably captures the spin-flip collective mode only for the Laughlin and Halperin states, and that too only in the long-wavelength limit. Interestingly, for spin-singlet primary Jain states, the spin-conserving density mode is inaccurate even in the long-wavelength regime. We show that this discrepancy stems from the presence of an additional high-energy spin-conserving parton mode, similar to that found in fully polarized secondary Jain states at $\nu{=}n/(4n{\pm}1)$. We propose an ansatz for this parton mode and compute its Coulomb dispersion in the singlet state at $\nu{=}2/5$. The predicted parton mode can be observed in circularly polarized inelastic light scattering experiments.

Title: Relaxation and Its Effects on Electronic Structure in Twisted Systems: An Analytical Perspective
Authors: Junxi Yu, Bingbing Wang, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: Lattice relaxation profoundly reshapes electronic structures in twisted materials. Prevailing treatments, however, typically rely on large-scale density functional theory (DFT), which is computationally costly and mechanistically opaque. Here, we develop a unified analytical framework to overcome these limitations. From continuum elastic theory, we derive closed-form solutions for both in-plane and out-of-plane relaxation fields. We further introduce an analytical phase factor expansion theory that maps relaxation into the electronic Hamiltonian. By applying this framework, the relaxation-mediated single-particle and many-body topological phase transitions in twisted MoTe$_{2}$ is accurately captured, and the evolution of flat bands in magic-angle graphene is quantitatively reproduced. Our work transforms the research of moiré relaxation from black-box numerical fitting to an analytical paradigm, offering fundamental insights, exceptional efficiency, and general applicability to a wide range of twisted materials.

Title: Electro-viscoelasticity of polymer melts in continuum theory
Authors: Zachary Wolfgram, Jeffrey G. Ethier, Matthew Grasinger
Abstract: Electro-viscoelastic theory for polymer melts has been extensively studied experimentally for the past century, primarily for manufacturing purposes. However, the modeling and theory for this have been minimal, leaving many questions on the mechanisms and behavior of an arbitrary flow scheme. To remedy this, previously solved overdamped Langevin equations for the Doi-Rouse model are modified to include charge and electric field potential forces. The charge sequence on the chain is hypothesized to be a cosine sequence along the chain, resembling multiple electric dipoles that conveniently correspond to a Rouse mode of the chain. These are then solved for the shear stress under homogeneous shear rates and electric fields to find directional viscosity increases depending on the shearing and electric field orientation. Using the newly derived shear stress from the Doi-Rouse approach, a continuum model is proposed that resembles a modified upper-convected Maxwell model, including polarization stresses in terms of an electric field dyadic. This new continuum model, named the upper-convected electro-Maxwell model, is verified using Kremer-Grest polymer chains simulated with molecular dynamics for multiple flow schemes and a specified charge sequence along the chain. Furthermore, the MD results verified the difference in the overall and charge sequence relaxation times through the shear and normal stress polarizations, showing the necessity for the upper-convected derivative of the electric field dyadic to correct the viscosity scaling. Finally, the dynamic properties of the polarized polymer melt are examined analytically, finding that the phase shift is unaffected by the electric field contribution.

Title: Instant prediction of relaxation in moiré superlattices using neural networks
Authors: Aleksei V. Belonovskii, Elizaveta I. Girshova, Erkki Lähderanta, Mikhail Kaliteevski
Abstract: The relaxation of moiré superlattices in twisted bilayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) has been modeled using a set of neural-network-based approaches. We implemented and compared several architectures, including (i) an interpolator combined with an autoencoder, (ii) an interpolator combined with a decoder, (iii) a direct generator mapping input parameters to displacement fields, and (iv) a physics-informed neural network (PINN). Among these, the direct generator architecture demonstrated the best performance, achieving machine-level precision with minimal training data. Remarkably, once trained, this simple fully connected network is able to predict the full displacement field of a moiré bilayer within a fraction of a second, whereas conventional continuum simulations require hours or even days. This finding highlights the low-dimensional nature of the relaxation process and establishes neural networks as a practical and efficient alternative to ab initio approaches for rapid modeling and high-throughput screening of 2D twisted heterostructures.

Title: Understanding oxide surface stability: Theoretical insights from silver chromate
Authors: Augusto Facundes, Thiago T. Dorini, Theodora W. von Zuben, Miguel A. San-Miguel
Abstract: Silver chromate ($\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$) has attracted considerable attention in recent years due to its promising photocatalytic performance, which strongly depends on the crystallographic orientation of its exposed surfaces. A detailed understanding of the structural stability of these surfaces under realistic conditions is therefore essential for advancing its applications. In this work, we combine density functional theory (DFT) with first-principles atomistic thermodynamics to systematically investigate the stability of multiple surface orientations and terminations of $\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$. The surface Gibbs free energy was evaluated as a function of oxygen and silver chemical potentials, enabling the construction of stability trends under non-vacuum environments. Our results reveal that the degree of coordination of surface chromium-oxygen clusters plays a decisive role in determining surface stability. Furthermore, Wulff constructions predict morphology evolution as a function of external conditions, allowing us to identify the atomic structures of the exposed facets in the equilibrium crystal shape. These insights provide a fundamental framework for understanding surface-dependent photocatalytic activity in $\mathrm{Ag_{2}CrO_{4}}$ and related silver-based oxides.

Title: Engineering strong correlations in a perfectly aligned dual moiré system
Authors: Amine Ben Mhenni, Elif Çetiner, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Jonathan J. Finley, Nathan P. Wilson
Abstract: Exotic collective phenomena emerge when bosons strongly interact within a lattice. However, creating a robust and tunable solid-state platform to explore such phenomena has been elusive. Dual moiré systems$-$compromising two Coulomb-coupled moiré lattices$-$offer a promising system for investigating strongly correlated dipolar excitons (composite bosons) with electrical control. Thus far, their implementation has been hindered by the relative misalignment and incommensurability of the two moiré patterns. Here we report a dual moiré system with perfect translational and rotational alignment, achieved by utilizing twisted hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) bilayer to both generate an electrostatic moiré potential and separate MoSe$_{2}$ and WSe$_{2}$ monolayers. We observe strongly correlated electron phases driven by intralayer interactions and identify interlayer Rydberg trions, which become trapped in the presence of the Mott insulating state. Importantly, our platform is electrostatically programmable, allowing the realization of different lattice symmetries with either repulsive or attractive interlayer interactions. In particular, we implement the latter scenario by optically injecting charges, which form a dipolar excitonic phase. Our results establish a versatile platform for the exploration and manipulation of exotic and topological bosonic quantum many-body phases.

Title: Low-energy spin waves as potential driving force for superconductivity in electron-doped cuprates

Abstract: In order to fully utilize the technological potential of unconventional superconductors, an enhanced understanding of the superconducting mechanism is necessary. In the best performing superconductors, the cuprates, superconductivity is intimately linked with magnetism, although the details of this remain elusive. In search of clarity in the magnetism-superconductivity relationship, we focus on the electron-doped cuprate Nd1.85Ce0.15CuO(4-delta) (NCCO). NCCO has an antiferromagnetic ground state when synthesized, and only becomes superconducting after a reductive annealing process. This makes NCCO an ideal template to study how the magnetism differs in the superconducting and non-superconducting state, while keeping the material template as constant as possible. Using neutron spectroscopy, we reveal that the as-grown crystal exhibits a large energy gap in the magnetic fluctuation spectrum. Upon annealing, defects that are introduced by the commonly employed synthesis method, are removed and the gap is significantly reduced. While the energy gap in the annealed sample is an effect of superconductivity, we argue that the gap in the as-grown sample is caused by the absence of long-wavelength spin waves. The defects in as-grown NCCO thus play the dual role of suppressing both superconductivity and low-energy spin waves, highlighting the connection between these two phenomena.

Title: Strain-tuned magnetoelectric properties of monolayer NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br): a first-principles analysis
Authors: Ali Ghojavand, Cem Sevik, Milorad V. Milošević
Abstract: Using \textit{ab initio} methodology, we reveal a strain-mediated approach to precisely tune the magnetoelectric coupling and spin-driven emergent polarization of NiX$_2$ (X = I, Br) monolayers. In the absence of strain, these systems spontaneously stabilize non-collinear spin states that break the inversion symmetry, inducing a ferroelectric polarization in the plane of the material. We show that biaxial and uniaxial strains broadly modulate the magnetoelectric response in these materials through two distinct mechanisms: (i) direct modification of the magnetoelectric tensor components, and (ii) tuning of the characteristic propagation vectors of a spin texture. This dual mechanism enables precise control over the magnitude of the spin-induced electric polarization of these materials. With respect to the achievable magnitude of the electric polarization, we demonstrate the critical role of third-nearest-neighbor spin-pair contributions, which can increase under strain to levels that compete with or even exceed the polarization driven by first-nearest-neighbor effects. These findings offer important insights into low-dimensional piezo-magnetoelectricity and expand the possibilities for designing multifunctional two-dimensional straintronic devices.

Title: Distinguishing Majorana bound states from accidental zero-energy modes with a microwave cavity
Authors: Sarath Prem, Olesia Dmytruk, Mircea Trif
Abstract: Transport measurements of hybrid nanowires often rely on the observation of a zero-bias conductance peak as a hallmark of Majorana bound states (MBSs). However, such signatures can also be produced by trivial zero-energy Andreev bound states (ABSs) or by quasi-Majorana bound states (QMBSs), complicating their unambiguous identification. Here we propose microwave absorption visibility, extracted from parity-dependent cavity-nanowire susceptibility measurements, as a complementary probe of MBSs nonlocality. We study a Rashba spin-orbit nanowire consisting of a proximitized superconducting segment and an uncovered quantum-dot region, capacitively coupled to a single-mode microwave cavity. We show that true MBSs yield finite visibility only when both MBSs are simultaneously coupled to the cavity, reflecting their intrinsic nonlocality. In contrast, ABSs and QMBSs exhibit visibility extrema even when the cavity couples only locally to part of the nanowire. We further demonstrate that this distinction persists in the presence of Gaussian disorder, which may otherwise generate trivial subgap states. Motivated by recent experiments, we also analyze ``poor man's" Majoranas in double-quantum-dot setups, where analytical results confirm the same nonlocal visibility criterion. Finally, we discuss a cavity-driven scheme for initializing the electronic system in a given parity state. Our results establish cavity-based visibility as a robust and versatile probe of MBSs, providing a clear route to distinguish them from trivial zero-energy states in hybrid superconducting platforms.

Title: High-throughput screening of spin Hall conductivity in 2D materials
Authors: Fu Li, Xiaoxiong Liu, Vikrant Chaudhary, Ruiwen Xie, Chen Shen, Hao Wang, Hongbin Zhang
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials with large spin Hall effect (SHE) have attracted significant attention due to their potential applications in next-generation spintronic devices. In this work, we perform high-throughput (HTP) calculations to obtain the spin Hall conductivity (SHC) of 4486 non-magnetic compounds in the \texttt{2Dmatpedia} database and identify six materials with SHC exceeding $500\,(\hbar/e)\,(\mathrm{S/cm})$, surpassing those of previously known materials. Detailed analysis reveals that the significant SHC can be attributed to spin-orbit coupling (SOC)-induced gap openings at Dirac-like band crossings. Additionally, the presence of mirror symmetry further enhances the SHC. Beyond the high-SHC materials, 57 topological insulators with quantized SHCs have also been identified. Our work enables rapid screening and paves the way for experimental validation, potentially accelerating the discovery of novel 2D materials optimized for spintronics applications.

Abstract: A disordered quasi-liquid layer of water is thought to cover the ice surface, but many issues, such as its onset temperature, its thickness, or its actual relation to bulk liquid water have been a matter of unsettled controversy for more than a century. In this perspective article, current computer simulations and experimental results are discussed under the light of a suitable theoretical framework. It is found that using a combination of wetting physics, the theory of intermolecular forces, statistical mechanics and out of equilibrium physics a large number of conflicting results can be reconciled and collected into a consistent description of the ice surface. This helps understand the crucial role of surface properties in a range of important applications, from the enigmatic structure of snow crystals to the slipperiness of ice.

Title: Band geometric transverse current driven by inhomogeneous AC electric field
Authors: M. Maneesh Kumar, Sanjay Sarkar, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: We develop a semiclassical theory for electron wavepacket dynamics in the presence of an inhomogeneous AC electric field. While static electric-field gradients are known to generate charge transport governed by the quantum metric, we show that AC field gradients induce an additional geometric current that vanishes in the DC limit. This response originates from a novel band-geometric quantity, the higher-order connection (HOC) tensor, constructed from cubic products of interband Berry connections. We derive explicit expressions for the AC current and identify the symmetry conditions under which it arises. Remarkably, inhomogeneous AC fields can generate an anomalous Hall-like response even in nonmagnetic systems. Applying the theory to Bernal-stacked bilayer graphene, we demonstrate that the HOC-induced response produces a measurable Hall current peaking at band edges. These results establish inhomogeneous AC fields as a powerful probe of higher-order band geometric quantities beyond Berry curvature and the quantum metric.

Title: Effective conduction-band model for zincblende III-V semiconductors in the presence of strain: tuning the properties of bulk crystals and nanostructures
Authors: Samuel D. Escribano, Alfredo Levy Yeyati, Elsa Prada
Abstract: Strain provides a powerful knob to tailor the electronic properties of semiconductors. Simple yet accurate approximations that capture strain effects in demanding simulations of mesoscopic nanostructures are therefore highly desirable. However, for III-V compounds, key materials for quantum applications, such approaches remain comparatively underdeveloped. In this work, we derive a compact, effective Hamiltonian that describes the conduction band of zincblende III-V semiconductors incorporating strain effects. Starting from the eight-band k$\cdot$p model with Bir-Pikus corrections, we perform a folding-down procedure to obtain analytical expressions for conduction-band strain-renormalized parameters, including the effective mass, chemical potential, spin-orbit coupling, and $g$-factor. The model reproduces full multiband results under small to moderate strain, while retaining a form suitable for device-scale calculations. We benchmark the model for bulk deformations and apply it to representative nanostructures, such as this http URL nanowires and planar heterostructures. Our results provide a practical and versatile tool for incorporating strain into the design of III-V semiconductor devices, enabling reliable predictions of their properties with direct implications for spintronic, straintronic, optoelectronic, and topological quantum technologies.

Title: Odd-parity longitudinal magnetoconductivity in time-reversal symmetry broken materials
Authors: Sunit Das, Akash Adhikary, Divya Sahani, Aveek Bid, Amit Agarwal
Abstract: Magnetotransport measurements are a sensitive probe of symmetry and electronic structure in quantum materials. While conventional metals exhibit longitudinal magnetoconductivity that is even in a magnetic field ($B$) for small $B$, we show that magnetic materials which intrinsically break time-reversal symmetry (TRS) show an {\it odd-parity magnetoconductivity} (OMC), with a leading linear-$B$ response. Using semiclassical transport theory, we derive explicit expressions for the longitudinal and transverse conductivities and identify their origin in Berry curvature and orbital magnetic moment. Crystalline symmetry analysis shows that longitudinal OMC follows the same point-group constraints as the anomalous Hall effect, while transverse OMC obeys distinct rules, providing an independent probe of TRS breaking. In the large $B$ quantum oscillation regime, we uncover both odd- and even-$B$ contributions, demonstrating OMC beyond the semiclassical picture. Explicit calculations in valley-polarized gapped graphene show that OMC peaks near the band edges, vanish in the band gap and follow the temperature dependence of the magnetic order parameter. Our results explain the odd-parity magnetoresistance recently observed in magnetized graphene and establish OMC as a robust transport signature of intrinsic TRS breaking in metals.

Title: QDFlow: A Python package for physics simulations of quantum dot devices
Authors: Donovan L. Buterakos, Sandesh S. Kalantre, Joshua Ziegler, Jacob M Taylor, Justyna P. Zwolak
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning (ML) have accelerated progress in calibrating and operating quantum dot (QD) devices. However, most ML approaches rely on access to large, high-quality labeled datasets for training, benchmarking, and validation, with labels capturing key features in the data. Obtaining such datasets experimentally is challenging due to limited data availability and the labor-intensive nature of labeling. QDFlow is an open-source physics simulator for multi-QD arrays that generates realistic synthetic data with ground-truth labels. QDFlow combines a self-consistent Thomas-Fermi solver, a dynamic capacitance model, and flexible noise modules to produce charge stability diagrams and ray-based data closely resembling experiments. With extensive tunable parameters and customizable noise models, QDFlow supports the creation of large, diverse datasets for ML development, benchmarking, and quantum device research.

Title: Mixed Triplet-Singlet Order Parameter in Decoupled Superconducting 1H Monolayers of Transition-Metal Dichalcogenides
Authors: Avior Almoalem, Sajilesh Kunhiparambath, Roni Anna Gofman, Yuval Nitzav, Ilay Mangel, Nitzan Ragoler, Jun Fujii, Ivana Vobornik, Francois Bertran, Amit Kanigel, Jonathan Ruhman, Vidya Madhavan
Abstract: Understanding the emergence of unconventional superconductivity, where the order parameter deviates from simple isotropic s-wave pairing, is a central puzzle in condensed matter physics. Transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), though generally regarded as conventional superconductors, display signatures of this unusual behavior and thus provide a particularly intriguing platform to explore how exotic states arise. Here we investigate the misfit compound (SnS)$_{1.15}$(TaS$_2$), a heterostructure composed of alternating SnS and 1H-TaS$_2$ layers. Using transport, photoemission, and scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate that the SnS layers effectively decouple the TaS$_2$ into electronically isolated 1H sheets. In this limit, the tunneling density of states reveals a clear two-gap superconducting spectrum with T$_c \sim$ 3.1 K. A theoretical model based on lack of inversion symmetry and finite-range attraction reproduces the observed multi-gap structure as a mixed singlet-triplet state. These results establish misfit compounds as a powerful platform for studying unconventional superconductivity in isolated 1H layers and for realizing multiple uncoupled superconductors within a single crystal.

Title: Derivation of the Landau-Zener formula via functional equations
Authors: Chen Sun
Abstract: The Landau-Zener formula describes the diabatic transition probability of a two-level system under linear driving. Its rigorous derivation typically relies on sophisticated mathematical tools, such as special functions, Laplace transforms, or contour integrals. In this work, we present a derivation of the Landau-Zener transition probability using a fundamentally different approach via functional equations. By leveraging integrability, we prove that this transition probability satisfies a functional equation, whose solutions establish the exponential form of the formula. The coefficient in the exponent is then determined through a lowest-order perturbation calculation. This derivation is rigorous and does not involve any sophisticated mathematics. Our work provides insights into the origin of the exponential form of the Landau-Zener transition probability, and shows that the Landau-Zener formula can be viewed as a consequence of integrability, though the two-level Landau-Zener Hamiltonian itself does not satisfy the integrability conditions.

Title: Optimal detection of quantum states via projective measurements
Authors: Giuseppe Del Vecchio Del Vecchio, Satya N. Majumdar
Abstract: We consider the quantum dynamical evolution of a fully-connected quantum system subjected to random projective measurements and study the first detection time of an extended subspace of the Hilbert space. Exact analytical expressions are obtained for the mean first detection time and the full first detection probability distribution as functionals of the initial state $\ket{\psi_0}$ and the measurement rate $r$. Exact enumeration agrees perfectly with our analytical predictions.

Title: Phases of 2d Gauge Theories and Symmetric Mass Generation
Authors: Rishi Mouland, David Tong, Bernardo Zan
Abstract: We study the dynamics and phase structure of Abelian gauge theories in $d=1+1$ dimensions. These include $U(1)$ gauge theory coupled to a scalar and a fermion, as well as the two-flavour Schwinger model with different charges. Both theories exhibit a surprisingly rich phase diagram as masses are varied, with both $c=1$ and $c=1/2$ critical lines or points. We build up to the study of 2d chiral gauge theories, which hold particular interest because they provide a mechanism for symmetric mass generation, a phenomenon in which fermions become gapped without breaking chiral symmetries.

Title: Spontaneous Kolmogorov-Arnold Geometry in Shallow MLPs
Authors: Michael Freedman, Michael Mulligan
Abstract: The Kolmogorov-Arnold (KA) representation theorem constructs universal, but highly non-smooth inner functions (the first layer map) in a single (non-linear) hidden layer neural network. Such universal functions have a distinctive local geometry, a "texture," which can be characterized by the inner function's Jacobian $J({\mathbf{x}})$, as $\mathbf{x}$ varies over the data. It is natural to ask if this distinctive KA geometry emerges through conventional neural network optimization. We find that indeed KA geometry often is produced when training vanilla single hidden layer neural networks. We quantify KA geometry through the statistical properties of the exterior powers of $J(\mathbf{x})$: number of zero rows and various observables for the minor statistics of $J(\mathbf{x})$, which measure the scale and axis alignment of $J(\mathbf{x})$. This leads to a rough understanding for where KA geometry occurs in the space of function complexity and model hyperparameters. The motivation is first to understand how neural networks organically learn to prepare input data for later downstream processing and, second, to learn enough about the emergence of KA geometry to accelerate learning through a timely intervention in network hyperparameters. This research is the "flip side" of KA-Networks (KANs). We do not engineer KA into the neural network, but rather watch KA emerge in shallow MLPs.

Title: Unsupervised Atomic Data Mining via Multi-Kernel Graph Autoencoders for Machine Learning Force Fields
Authors: Hong Sun, Joshua A. Vita, Amit Samanta, Vincenzo Lordi
Abstract: Constructing a chemically diverse dataset while avoiding sampling bias is critical to training efficient and generalizable force fields. However, in computational chemistry and materials science, many common dataset generation techniques are prone to oversampling regions of the potential energy surface. Furthermore, these regions can be difficult to identify and isolate from each other or may not align well with human intuition, making it challenging to systematically remove bias in the dataset. While traditional clustering and pruning (down-sampling) approaches can be useful for this, they can often lead to information loss or a failure to properly identify distinct regions of the potential energy surface due to difficulties associated with the high dimensionality of atomic descriptors. In this work, we introduce the Multi-kernel Edge Attention-based Graph Autoencoder (MEAGraph) model, an unsupervised approach for analyzing atomic datasets. MEAGraph combines multiple linear kernel transformations with attention-based message passing to capture geometric sensitivity and enable effective dataset pruning without relying on labels or extensive training. Demonstrated applications on niobium, tantalum, and iron datasets show that MEAGraph efficiently groups similar atomic environments, allowing for the use of basic pruning techniques for removing sampling bias. This approach provides an effective method for representation learning and clustering that can be used for data analysis, outlier detection, and dataset optimization.

Title: Entanglement and optimization within autoregressive neural quantum states
Authors: Andrew Jreissaty, Hang Zhang, Jairo C. Quijano, Juan Carrasquilla, Roeland Wiersema
Abstract: Neural quantum states (NQS) are powerful variational ansätze capable of representing highly entangled quantum many-body wavefunctions. While the average entanglement properties of ensembles of restricted Boltzmann machines are well understood, the entanglement structure of autoregressive NQS such as recurrent neural networks and transformers remains largely unexplored. We perform large-scale simulations of ensembles of random autoregressive wavefunctions for chains of up to $256$ spins and uncover signatures of transitions in their average entanglement scaling, entanglement spectra, and correlation functions. We show that the standard softmax normalization of the wavefunction suppresses entanglement and fluctuations, and introduce a square modulus normalization function that restores them. Finally, we connect the insights gained from our entanglement and activation function analysis to initialization strategies for finding the ground states of strongly correlated Hamiltonians via variational Monte Carlo.

Title: GPU-Accelerated MATLAB Software for Atom-Ion Dynamics
Authors: Saajid Chowdhury, Jesús Pérez-Ríos
Abstract: We present a MATLAB script which can use GPU acceleration to simulate a trapped ion interacting with a low-density cloud of atoms. This script, called atomiongpu.m, can massively parallelize MD simulations of trajectories of a trapped ion and an atom starting far away. The script uses ode45gpu, which is our optimized and specialized implementation of the Runge-Kutta algorithm used in MATLAB's ODE solver ode45. We first discuss the physical system and show how ode45gpu can solve it up to 22x faster than MATLAB's ode45. Then, we show how to easily modify the inputs to atomiongpu.m to account for different kinds of atoms, ions, atom-ion interactions, trap potentials, simulation parameters, initial conditions, and computational hardware, so that atomiongpu.m automatically finds the probability of complex formation, the distribution of observables such as the scattering angle and complex lifetime, and plots of specific trajectories.

Authors: Rafał Porzeziński, Arkadiusz Mandowski
Abstract: A simplified version of the semi-localized transitions (SLT) model is derived. The SLT-QE5 approximation reduces the number of differential equations from seven to five. Numerical calculations show that the approximation is very good for various trap parameters except the case with large reduction of activation energy during recombination to adjacent hole together with very low retrapping coefficient.

Title: Liquid Helium Cryogenic TEM below 1 Å
Authors: Suk Hyun Sung, Maya Gates, Nishkarsh Agarwal, Yang Zhang, William Millsaps, Miti Shah, Emily Rennich, Cong Li, Pu Yu, Miaofang Chi, Benjamin H. Savitzky, Ismail El Baggari, Robert Hovden
Abstract: Next-generation cryogenic transmission electron microscopes (TEM) aim to achieve high-resolution imaging at ultracold sample temperatures (< 90 K) and over extended hold times. Lower temperatures enable atomic-scale characterization with improved beam and dose resilience for organic specimens and access to emergent electronic phases in quantum materials. Side-entry liquid helium cooling stages presently lack the mechanical and thermal stability required to support sub-Angstrom information transfer in modern TEM. Here we demonstrate sub-Angstrom atomic imaging TEM with a side-entry stage at specimen temperatures down to ~20K and with low stage drift and stable hold times.

Title: Leveraging Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) to Simulate Large Atomistic Systems for Fidelity Improvement of Superconducting Qubits and Sensors
Authors: Søren Smidstrup, Shela Aboud, Ricardo Borges, Anders Blom, Pankaj Aggarwal, Robert Freeman, Jamil Kawa
Abstract: Materials engineering using atomistic modeling is an essential tool for the development of qubits and quantum sensors. Traditional density-functional theory (DFT) does however not adequately capture the complete physics involved, including key aspects and dynamics of superconductivity, surface states, etc. There are also significant challenges regarding the system sizes that can be simulated, not least for thermal properties which are key in quantum-computing applications. The QuantumATK tool combines DFT, based on LCAO basis sets, with non-equilibrium Green's functions, to compute the characteristics of interfaces between superconductors and insulators, as well as the surface states of topological insulators. Additionally, the software leverages machine-learned force-fields to simulate thermal properties and to generate realistic amorphous geometries in large-scale systems. Finally, the description of superconducting qubits and sensors as two-level systems modeled with a double-well potential requires many-body physics, and this paper demonstrates how electron-electron interaction can be added to the single-particle energy levels from an atomistic tight-binding model to describe a realistic double-quantum dot system.

Title: Aerophilic Debubbling
Authors: Bert J.C. Vandereydt, Saurabh Nath, Kripa K. Varanasi
Abstract: In this letter, we characterize quantitatively the complex phenomenon of debubbling via aerophilic membranes by examining local interactions at the scale of single bubbles. We identify three asymptotic limits of evacuation dictated by Rayleigh, Ohnesorge and Darcy dynamics, the physics of which we capture using simple scaling laws. We show that beyond a threshold permeability, bubble evacuations become constant in time - a feature we understand as an inertio-capillary limit. Our experiments reveal that the fastest bubble evacuations require an interface that is nearly a liquid, but not quite.

Title: Pulsed Generation of Continuous-Variable Cluster States in a Phononic Quantum Network
Authors: A. Govindarajan, M. Mazzei, H. Wang, L. Tian
Abstract: Cluster states are multipartite entangled states that are maximally connected and resilient to decoherence, making them valuable resources for quantum information processing. Continuous-variable (CV) cluster states have been extensively investigated for such applications. Here we present a pulsed protocol for generating CV cluster states in a phononic quantum network composed of phonon waveguides, mechanical resonators, and optical cavities. A key feature of this architecture is the modular design, where pairs of mechanical modes act as building blocks with only local, tunable interactions between mechanical and cavity modes. The scheme is scalable, requiring just $4N$ driving tones for $N$ mechanical resonators. We characterize the resulting cluster states by evaluating the nullifiers of the CV modes. We also study the effects of dissipation, showing that strong squeezing with large phonon occupations can degrade the generated cluster states under finite mechanical and optical losses. As a direct application, we demonstrate that distant mechanical modes can be entangled via local measurements.

Title: Morphological and Chemical Changes in Cd-free Colloidal QD-LEDs During Operation

Abstract: Heavy metal-free quantum-dot light-emitting devices (QD-LEDs) have demonstrated remarkable brightness, saturated color, and high efficiencies across a broad spectral range. However, in contrast to organic LEDs (OLEDs), QD-LED operational lifetimes remain limited, with the underlying degradation mechanisms not fully understood. In the present study, we show that InP/ZnSe/ZnS (red-emitting) and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS (blue-emitting) cadmium-free colloidal QD-LEDs undergo nanoscale morphological changes during operation. Specifically,interparticle coarsening and layer thinning are observed in the electron transport layer (ETL) consisting of ZnMgO nanoparticles (NPs), in the QD emissive layer, and in the organic hole transport layer. This is accompanied by the generation and diffusion of compositional oxygen- and hydrogen-radicals throughout the device, with oxygen accumulating at the electrode/ETL interfance. Moreover, in situ transmission electron microscopy reveals the electron beam exposure, in the presence of hydrogen radicals, accelerates ZnMgO NPs coarsening. To mitigate these degradation pathway, we show that acrylate-based resin-encapsulation treatment stabilize the ETL/QD layers by suppressing the radical formation and halting morphology changes. This approach achieves dramatic stability enhancements, exhibits an 8-fold and 5000-fold lifetime improvement on InP/ZnSe/ZnS and ZnTeSe/ZnSe/ZnS QD-LEDs, respectively. Our findings establish the causal relationships between the morphological degradation, interlayer radical dynamics, and state-of-the-art QD-LEDs instability, providing new insights into a scalable encapsulation treatment that enables efficient and long-lived Cd-free QD-LEDs.

Title: Oxygen vacancy formation in ZnSeTe blue quantum dot light-emitting diodes
Authors: Shaun Tan, Sujin Park, Seung-Gu Choi, Oliver J. Tye, Ruiqi Zhang, Jonah R. Horowitz, Heejae Chung, Vladimir Bulović, Jeonghun Kwak, Jin-Wook Lee, Taehyung Kim, Moungi G. Bawendi
Abstract: Recent advancements have led to the development of bright and heavy metal-free blue-emitting quantum dot light-emitting diodes (QLEDs). However, consensus understanding of their distinct photophysical and electroluminescent dynamics remains elusive. This work correlates the chemical and electronic changes occurring in a QLED during operation using depth-resolved and operando techniques. The results indicate that oxygen vacancy forms in the ZnMgO layer during operation, with important implications on the charge injection and electrochemical dynamics. Taken together, the results suggest a causal relationship between oxygen vacancy formation and operational degradation of the blue-emitting ZnSeTe-based QLEDs.

Title: Dynamically reconfigurable topological routing in nonlinear photonic systems
Authors: Stephan Wong, Simon Betzold, Sven Hofling, Alexander Cerjan
Abstract: The propagation path of topologically protected states is bound to the interface between regions with different topology, and as such, the functionality of linear photonic devices leveraging these states is fixed during fabrication. Here, we propose a mechanism for dynamic control over a driven dissipative system's local topology, yielding reconfigurable topological interfaces and thus tunable paths for protected routing. We illustrate our approach in non-resonantly pumped polariton lattices, where the nonlinear interaction between the polaritons and the exciton reservoir due to non-resonant pumping can yield a dynamical change of the topology. Moreover, using a continuous model of the polariton system based on a driven-dissipative Gross-Pitaevskii equation alongside the spectral localizer framework, we show that the local changes in the nonlinear non-Hermitian system's topology are captured by a local Chern marker. Looking forward, we anticipate such reconfigurable topological routing will enable the realization of novel classes of topological photonic devices.

Title: Quantifying Local Point-Group-Symmetry Order in Complex Particle Systems
Authors: Domagoj Fijan, Maria R. Ward Rashidi, Sharon C. Glotzer
Abstract: Crystals and other condensed phases are defined primarily by their inherent symmetries, which play a crucial role in dictating their structural properties. In crystallization studies, local order parameters (OPs) that describe bond orientational order are widely employed to investigate crystal formation. Despite their utility, these traditional metrics do not directly quantify symmetry, an important aspect for understanding the development of order during crystallization. To address this gap, we introduce a new set of OPs, called Point Group Order Parameters (PGOPs), designed to continuously quantify point group symmetry order. We demonstrate the strength and utility of PGOP in detecting order across different crystalline systems and compare its performance to commonly used bond-orientational order metrics. PGOP calculations for all non-infinite point groups are implemented in the open-source package SPATULA (Symmetry Pattern Analysis Toolkit for Understanding Local Arrangements), written in parallelized C++ with a Python interface. The code is publicly available on GitHub.

Title: Non-Markovian amplitude damping in a central spin model with random couplings
Authors: Mehboob Rashid, Rayees A Mala, Saima Bashir, Muzaffar Qadir Lone
Abstract: Non-Markovian dynamics is central to quantum information processing, as memory effects strongly influence coherence preservation, metrology, and communication. In this work, we investigate the role of stochastic system--bath couplings in shaping non-Markovian behavior of open quantum systems, using the central spin model within a time-convolutionless master equation framework. We show that the character of the reduced dynamics depends jointly on the intrinsic memory of the environment and on the structure of the system--environment interaction. In certain regimes, the dynamics simplify to pure dephasing, while in general both amplitude damping and dephasing contribute to the evolution. By employing two complementary measures: the Quantum Fisher Information (QFI) flow and the Breuer--Laine--Piilo (BLP) measure, we demonstrate that QFI flow may fail to witness memory effects in weak-coupling and near-resonant regimes, whereas the BLP measure still detects information backflow. Furthermore, external modulation of the interaction kernel produces qualitatively richer behavior, including irregular and frequency-dependent revivals of non-Markovianity. These results clarify the physical origin of memory effects, highlight the limitations of single-witness approaches, and suggest that stochasticity and modulation can be harnessed to engineer robust, noise-resilient quantum technologies.

Title: Ancilla-train quantum algorithm for simulating non-Markovian open quantum systems
Authors: Hans Michael Christensen, Johannes Agerskov, Frederik Nathan
Abstract: We present a quantum algorithm for simulating open quantum systems coupled to Gaussian environments valid for any configuration and coupling strength. The algorithm is for instance applicable to problems with strongly coupled, or non-Markovian, environments; problems with multiple environments out of mutual equilibrium; and problems with time-dependent Hamiltonians. We show that the algorithm can reproduce the true dynamics of such problems at arbitrary accuracy and, for a broad range of problems, only adds a minor resource cost relative to Trotterized time evolution; the cost is polynomial in the inverse target accuracy. The algorithm is based on the insight that any Gaussian environment can be represented as a train of ancillary qubits that sequentially interact with the system through a time-local coupling, given by the convolution square root of the bath correlation function; this is a secondary result of our work. Our results open up new applications of quantum computers for efficient simulation of non-equilibrium and open quantum systems.

Title: Superluminal Liouville walls in 2d String Theory and space-like singularities
Authors: Sumit R. Das, Shaun D. Hampton, Sinong Liu
Abstract: An interesting class of time dependent backgrounds in $1+1$ dimensional string theory involves worldsheet Liouville walls which move in (target space) time. When a parameter in such a background exceeds a certain critical value, the speed of the Liouville wall exceeds the speed of light, and there is no usual S-Matrix. We examine such backgrounds in the dual $c=1$ matrix model from the point of view of fluctuations of the collective field, and determine the nature of the emergent space-time perceived by these fluctuations. We show that so long as the corresponding Liouville wall remains time-like, the emergent space time is conformal to full Minkowski space with a time-like wall. However, for the cases where the Liouville wall is superluminal, the emergent space-time has a {\em space-like boundary} where the collective field couplings diverge. This appears as a space-like singularity in perturbative collective field theory. We comment on the necessity of incorporating finite $N$, as well as finite (double-scaled) coupling, effects to understand the behavior of the exact theory near this boundary.

Title: Pressure dependent structure of neat liquid methanol, CH3OH: molecular dynamics simulations with various united atom type potentials
Authors: Imre Bakó, László Pusztai, Orest Pizio
Abstract: Molecular dynamics computer simulations have been conducted on neat liquid methanol, using three different united atom (three site) interatomic potentials: TraPPE [J. Phys. Chem. B 105, 3093 (2001)], UAM-I [J. Mol. Liq. 323, 114576 (2021)] and OPLS/2016 [J. Chem. Phys. 145, 034508 (2016)]. The effects of pressure, between 1 bar and 6 kbar, have been evaluated on total scattering structure factors, partial radial distribution functions, as well as on collective characteristics such as ring size distributions and cluster size distributions. Agreement with experimental density is nearly quantitative for all the three force fields, and major trends observed for recent pressure dependent neutron diffraction data are reproduced qualitatively. The OPLS/2016 force field, in general, generates properties that are markedly different from results originating from the other potentials. Pressure effects are hardly noticeable on most partial radial distribution functions and on the distribution of the number of hydrogen bonded neighbours. On the other hand, collective structural properties, like cluster- and ring size distributions exhibit significant changes with increasing pressure: larger clusters become more numerous, whereas the number of cyclic clusters, i.e., rings, decrease. The self-diffusion coefficient decreases with increasing pressure, and the same is valid for the average lifetime of hydrogen bonds.

Title: Benchmarking thermostat algorithms in molecular dynamics simulations of a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model
Authors: Kumpei Shiraishi, Emi Minamitani, Kang Kim
Abstract: A systematic comparison was carried out to assess the influence of representative thermostat methods in constant-temperature molecular dynamics simulations. The thermostat schemes considered include the Nosé--Hoover thermostat and its chain generalisation, the Bussi velocity rescaling method, and several implementations of the Langevin dynamics. Using a binary Lennard-Jones liquid as a model glass former, we investigated how the sampling of physical observables, such as particle velocities and potential energy, responds to changes in time step across these thermostats. While the Nosé--Hoover chain and Bussi thermostats provide reliable temperature control, a pronounced time-step dependence was observed in the potential energy. Amongst the Langevin methods, the Grønbech-Jensen--Farago scheme provided the most consistent sampling of both temperature and potential energy. Nonetheless, Langevin dynamics typically incurs approximately twice the computational cost due to the overhead of random number generation, and exhibits a systematic decrease in diffusion coefficients with increasing friction. This study presents a broad comparison of thermostat methods using a binary Lennard-Jones glass-former model, offering practical guidance for the choice of thermostats in classical molecular dynamics simulations. These findings provide useful insights for diverse applications, including glass transition, phase separation, and nucleation.

Title: Symmetry-Resolved Spread Complexity
Authors: Pawel Caputa, Giuseppe Di Giulio, Tran Quang Loc
Abstract: In this work, we investigate the impact of conserved charges on the dynamics of spread complexity of quantum states. Building on the notion of symmetry-resolved Krylov complexity [1], we extend the framework to general quantum states and analyze the relation between the total spread complexity and its decomposition into fixed-charge sectors. After exploring a range of analytical examples and using orthogonal polynomial approach, we identify conditions under which spread complexity exhibits equipartition across sectors. Finally, we discuss quantum speed limits that constrain the growth of complexity in the presence of conserved charges.

Title: Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing
Authors: Kwai-Kong Ng, Min-Fong Yang
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.

Title: Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver: Escaping Barren Plateaus through Staircase Descent
Authors: Hao Zhang, Ayush Asthana
Abstract: We introduce the Cyclic Variational Quantum Eigensolver (CVQE), a hardware-efficient framework for accurate ground-state quantum simulation on noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) devices. CVQE departs from conventional VQE by incorporating a measurement-driven feedback cycle: Slater determinants with significant sampling probability are iteratively added to the reference superposition, while a fixed entangler (e.g., single-layer UCCSD) is reused throughout. This adaptive reference growth systematically enlarges the variational space in most promising directions, avoiding manual ansatz or operator-pool design, costly searches, and preserving compile-once circuits. The strategy parallels multi-reference methods in quantum chemistry, while remaining fully automated on quantum hardware. Remarkably, CVQE exhibits a distinctive staircase-like descent pattern, where successive energy drops sharply signal efficient escape from barren plateaus. Benchmarks show that CVQE consistently maintains chemical precision across correlation regimes, outperforms fixed UCCSD by several orders of magnitude, and achieves favorable accuracy-cost trade-offs compared to the Selected Configuration Interaction. These results position CVQE as a scalable, interpretable, and resource-efficient paradigm for near-term quantum simulation.

Title: From higher-order moments to time correlation functions in strongly correlated systems: A DMRG-based memory kernel coupling theory
Authors: Yunhao Liu, Wenjie Dou
Abstract: We introduce a hybrid approach for computing dynamical observables in strongly correlated systems using higher-order moments. This method integrates memory kernel coupling theory (MKCT) with the density matrix renormalization group (DMRG), extending our recent work on MKCT to strongly correlated systems. The method establishes that correlation functions can be derived from the moments. Within our framework, operators and wavefunctions are represented as matrix product operators (MPOs) and matrix product states (MPSs), respectively. Crucially, the repeated application of the Liouville operator is achieved through an iterative procedure analogous to the DMRG algorithm itself. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of MKCT-DMRG by computing the spectral function of the Hubbard model. Furthermore, we successfully apply the method to compute the electronic friction in the Hubbard-Holstein model. In all cases, the results show excellent agreement with time-dependent DMRG (TD-DMRG) benchmarks. The advantage of MKCT-DMRG over TD-DMRG is the computational efficiency, which avoids expensive real-time propagation in TD-DMRG. These findings establish MKCT-DMRG as a promising and accurate framework for simulating challenging dynamical properties in strongly correlated quantum systems.

Abstract: Fix a smooth Morse function $U\colon \mathbb{R}^{d}\to\mathbb{R}$ with finitely many critical points, and consider the solution of the stochastic differential equation \begin{equation*} d\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t)=-\nabla U(\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(t))\,dt \,+\,\sqrt{2\epsilon}\, d\bm{w}_{t}\,, \end{equation*} where $(\bm{w}_{t})_{t\ge0}$ represents a $d$-dimensional Brownian motion, and $\epsilon>0$ a small parameter. Denote by $\mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})$ the space of probability measures on $\bb R^d$, and by $\mathcal{I}_{\epsilon} \colon \mathcal{P}(\mathbb{R}^{d})\to[0,\,\infty]$ the Donsker--Varadhan level two large deviations rate functional. We express $\mc I_\epsilon$ as $\mc I_\epsilon = \epsilon^{-1} \mc J^{(-1)} + \mc J^{(0)} + \sum_{1\le p\le \mf q} (1/\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon) \, \mc J^{(p)}$, where $\mc J^{(p)}\colon \mc P(\bb R^d) \to [0,+\infty]$ stand for rate functionals independent of $\epsilon$ and $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ for sequences such that $\theta^{(1)}_\epsilon \to\infty$, $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon / \theta^{(p+1)}_\epsilon \to 0$ for $1\le p< \mf q$. The speeds $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$ correspond to the time-scales at which the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ exhibits a metastable behaviour, while the functional $\mc J^{(p)}$ represent the level two, large deviations rate functionals of the finite-state, continuous-time Markov chains which describe the evolution of the diffusion $\bm{x}_{\epsilon}(\cdot)$ among the wells in the time-scale $\theta^{(p)}_\epsilon$.

Title: The transition to collective motion in nonreciprocal active matter: coarse graining agent-based models into fluctuating hydrodynamics
Authors: David Martin, Daniel Seara, Yael Avni, Michel Fruchart, Vincenzo Vitelli
Abstract: Two hallmarks of non-equilibrium systems, from active colloids to animal herds, are agents motility and nonreciprocal interactions. Their interplay creates feedback loops leading to complex spatiotemporal dynamics crucial to understand and control the nonlinear response of active systems. Here, we introduce a minimal model that captures these two features at the microscopic scale, while admitting an exact hydrodynamic theory valid also in the fully-nonlinear regime. Our goal is to account for the fact that animal herds and colloidal swarms are rarely in the thermodynamic limit where particle number fluctuations can be completely ignored. Using statistical mechanics techniques we exactly coarse-grain a nonreciprocal microscopic model into a fluctuating hydrodynamics and use dynamical systems insights to analyze the resulting equations. In the absence of motility, we find two transitions to oscillatory phases occurring via distinct mechanisms: a Hopf bifurcation and a Saddle-Node on Invariant Circle (SNIC) bifurcation. In the presence of motility, this rigorous approach, complemented by numerical simulations, allows us to quantitatively assess the hitherto neglected impact of inter-species nonreciprocity on a paradigmatic transition in active matter: the emergence of collective motion. When nonreciprocity is weak, we show that flocking is accelerated and bands tend to synchronize with a spatial overlap controlled by nonlinearities. When nonreciprocity is strong, flocking is superseded by a Chase & Rest dynamical phase where each species alternates between a chasing state, when they propagate, and a resting state, when they stand still. Finally, we demonstrate how fluctuations in finite systems can be harnessed to characterize microscopic non-reciprocity from macroscopic time-correlation functions, even in phases where nonreciprocal interactions do not affect the thermodynamic steady-state.

Title: Microscopic Transport Theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations in a disordered 2D Electron System with Spin-Orbit Scatterings
Authors: Tsofar Maniv, Vladimir Zhuravlev
Abstract: A microscopic theory of Cooper-pair fluctuations (CPFs) in a disordered 2D electron system with spin-orbit scatterings under parallel magnetic field is presented in light of the observation, at low temperatures, of large magnetoresistance (MR) above a crossover field to superconductivity in electron-doped SrTiO$_{3}$/LaAlO$_{3}$ interfaces. It is found that in the zero temperature limit the conventional (diagrammatic) microscopic theory of superconducting (SC) fluctuations yields vanishing fluctuation conductivity just above the superconducting transition. However, further analysis of the results of the microscopic theory reveals that due to the diminishing stiffness of the fluctuation modes in a broad range of momentum space, the density of the CPFs, defined consistently with the time dependent Ginzburg-Landau approach, diverges in the zero temperature limit at any finite magnetic field. This field-induced divergence of the CPFs density, within restricted mesoscopic regions in real space, which is relieved by quantum tunneling and pair breaking out of their mesoscopic enclaves, indicates that the grand canonical ensemble underlying the microscopic theory is unsubstantiated. A dynamical equilibrium between the condensed CPFs in real-space mesoscopic puddles and the rarefying system of unpaired electrons controls the residual normal-state conductivity at magnetic fields above the SC transition. It has been, therefore, concluded that under the diminishing fluctuation paraconductivity upon increasing magnetic field the density of the normal-state electrons is also suppressed (due to charge transfer to the localized CPFs) and so, resulting from electron localization, the overall MR is strongly enhanced.

Title: Shear-induced diffusivity in supercooled liquids
Authors: Mangesh Bhendale, Jayant K. Singh, Alessio Zaccone
Abstract: The Taylor-Aris theory of shear diffusion predicts that the effective diffusivity of a tracer molecule in a sheared liquid is enhanced by a term quadratic in the shear rate. In sheared supercooled liquids, instead, the observed enhancement is linear in the shear rate. This is a fundamental observation for the physics of nonequilibrium liquids. Here, we derive a formula for the effective molecular diffusivity in supercooled liquids under shear flow based on the underlying Smoluchowski equation with shear (Smoluchowski diffusion-convection equation) with an energy barrier due to the crowded energy landscape. The obtained formula recovers the effective diffusivity with a correction term linear in the shear rate, in reasonable agreement with results from numerical simulations of different liquids as well as with earlier experimental results on shear melting of colloidal glass. The theory predictions are compared with molecular simulations of supercooled water and supercooled Lennard-Jones liquids. The comparison suggests that the predicted enhancement of diffusivity is inversely proportional to temperature and directly proportional to the zero shear viscosity.

Title: Higgs Phases and Boundary Criticality
Authors: Kristian Tyn Kai Chung, Rafael Flores-Calderón, Rafael C. Torres, Pedro Ribeiro, Sergej Moroz, Paul McClarty
Abstract: Motivated by recent work connecting Higgs phases to symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases, we investigate the interplay of gauge redundancy and global symmetry in lattice gauge theories with Higgs fields in the presence of a boundary. The core conceptual point is that a global symmetry associated to a Higgs field, which is pure-gauge in a closed system, acts physically at the boundary under boundary conditions which allow electric flux to escape the system. We demonstrate in both Abelian and non-Abelian models that this symmetry is spontaneously broken in the Higgs regime, implying the presence of gapless edge modes. Starting with the U(1) Abelian Higgs model in 4D, we demonstrate a boundary phase transition in the 3D XY universality class separating the bulk Higgs and confining regimes. Varying the boundary coupling while preserving the symmetries shifts the location of the boundary phase transition. We then consider non-Abelian gauge theories with fundamental and group-valued Higgs matter, and identify the analogous non-Abelian global symmetry acting on the boundary generated by the total color charge. For SU($N$) gauge theory with fundamental Higgs matter we argue for a boundary phase transition in the O($2N$) universality class, verified numerically for $N=2,3$. For group-valued Higgs matter, the boundary theory is a principal chiral model exhibiting chiral symmetry breaking. We further demonstrate this mechanism in theories with higher-form Higgs fields. We show how the higher-form matter symmetry acts at the boundary and can spontaneously break, exhibiting a boundary confinement-deconfinement transition. We also study the electric-magnetic dual theory, demonstrating a dual magnetic defect condensation transition at the boundary. We discuss some implications and extensions of these findings and what they may imply for the relation between Higgs and SPT phases.

Title: A comprehensive study of nonlinear perturbations in the dynamics of planar crack fronts
Authors: Itamar Kolvin, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia
Abstract: The interaction of crack fronts with asperities is central to the criteria of fracture in heterogeneous materials and for predicting fracture surface formation. It is known how dynamic crack fronts respond to small, 1st-order, perturbations. However, large and localized disturbances to crack motion induce dynamic and geometric nonlinear effects beyond the existing linear theories. Because the determination of the 3D elastic fields surrounding perturbed crack fronts is a necessary step towards any theoretical study of crack front dynamics, we develop a 2nd-order perturbation theory for the asymptotic fields of planar crack fronts. Based on previous work, we consider two models of fracture. In the so-called scalar elastic model, which is analogous to anti-plane (Mode III) fracture, the stress and displacement fields are obtained through matched asymptotic expansions. A self-consistent expansion is used to resolve the fields near tensile (Mode I) crack fronts. Both methods can be extended to higher perturbation orders. The main results of this work are the explicit 2nd-order expressions of the local dynamic energy-release-rates for perturbations of straight fronts. These general formulae recover the known energy-release-rates of curved quasi-static fronts and of straight dynamic fronts.

Title: Creation of domain-wall Skyrmions in chiral magnets
Authors: Sven Bjarke Gudnason, Yuki Amari, Muneto Nitta
Abstract: We study the capture of a magnetic Skyrmion into a domain wall (DW) structure in chiral magnets and find that in the respective ground states of the DW and the Skyrmion, they repel each other. This means that an isolated magnetic Skyrmion cannot a priori enter the DW and become a DW-Skyrmion. However, rotating the DW's phase away from the stable phase may cause the successful capture and hence creation of a stable bound state of a magnetic Skyrmion and a DW: the DW-Skyrmion. At certain distances, the DW may also destroy the magnetic Skyrmion by inducing shrinkage of the latter. This happens as the isolated magnetic Skyrmion has negative DMI energy, whereas the DW-Skyrmion has positive DMI energy; in a finite range from the DW, the magnetic Skyrmion can be pushed to have vanishing DMI energy, for which it collapses to a point. En passant, we find the possibility of pair creation of a Skyrmion anti-DW-Skyrmion pair and a creation of more than one DW-Skyrmions by a Kibble-like mechanism.

Title: Dual Role for Heterogeneity in Dynamic Fracture
Authors: Itamar Kolvin, Mokhtar Adda-Bedia
Abstract: We approach the problem of heterogeneous dynamic fracture by considering spatiotemporal perturbations to planar crack fronts. Front propagation is governed by local energy balance between the elastic energy per unit area available to fracture, G, and the dissipation in creating new surfaces. G is known analytically as a perturbation series in the crack front fluctuation. For dissipation that monotonically increases with the crack speed, we derive an equation of motion for crack fronts that is second-order accurate. In the linear order, heterogeneity does not change the net speed of fracture. In the second order, nonlinear interactions of the front and the heterogeneous landscape populate an intermediate-scale fluctuation spectrum. We find that, when dissipation weakly grows with velocity, nonlinearities globally amplify dissipation and reduce the crack speed. Strong velocity dependence, however, mitigates toughening effects and may facilitate fracture.

Title: RECP mechanism is responsible for the phase diagram of high-T_{C} cuprates
Authors: Felix A. Buot, Danilo Yanga, Roland E. S. Otadoy, Unofre Pili
Abstract: Our novel strong pairing mechanism for high-Tc cuprates qualitatively explains the whole phase diagram of both electron and hole-doped cuprates, notably the linearly decreasing T* at the pseudogap, presence of spin gap, the Tc=T* at the optimum doping as well as the rest of over-doped regions of superconducting dome, presence of parallel superconducting stripes in CuO plane (spin-polarized and spin-unpolarized channels), and linear-T behavior of strange-metal phase above the overdoped regions of superconducting dome. It also explains experimental spin textures of cuprates. This can be considered a drastic revision of Anderson's resonating valence bonds (RVB) theory. We refer to our new model as a resonating entanglement-confinement pair (RECP) theory. Based on RECP theory, we are able to give a conceptual, phenomenological, qualitative, and comprehensive explanation of the whole phase diagram, thus giving a universal feature of RECP mechanism as responsible for the whole phase diagram of high-Tc cuprates

Title: Duality defect in a deformed transverse-field Ising model
Authors: Fei Yan, Robert Konik, Aditi Mitra
Abstract: Physical quantities with long lifetimes have both theoretical significance in the study of quantum many-body systems and practical implications for quantum technologies. In this manuscript, we investigate the roles played by topological defects in the construction of quasi-conserved quantities, using as a prototypical example the Kramers-Wannier duality defect in a deformed 1d quantum transverse field Ising model. We construct the duality defect Hamiltonian in three different ways: half-chain Kramers-Wannier transformation, utilization of techniques in the Ising fusion category, and defect-modified weak integrability breaking deformation. The third method is also applicable for the study of generic integrable defects under weak integrability breaking deformations. We also work out the deformation of defect-modified higher charges in the model and study their slower decay behavior. Furthermore, we consider the corresponding duality defect twisted deformed Floquet transverse field Ising model, and investigate the stability of the isolated zero mode associated with the duality defect in the integrable Floquet Ising model, under such weak integrability breaking deformation.

Title: Quantum many-body scars through the lens of correlation matrix
Authors: Zhiyuan Yao, Pengfei Zhang
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) -- rare eigenstates that evade thermalization -- are typically characterized by their low entanglement entropies compared to surrounding thermal eigenstates. However, due to finite-size effects in systems accessible via exact diagonalization, this measure can be ambiguous. To address this limitation, we propose using the correlation matrix spectrum as an alternative probe to identify QMBS. In cases of exact QMBS that either have known analytic expressions or are captured by various frameworks of QMBS, we find that the dimensionality of the null space of the correlation matrix -- an integer value, and thus immune to finite-size effects -- can qualitatively identify QMBS. Beyond serving as a diagnostic tool, the correlation matrix method enables the manipulation of the QMBS subspace. For approximate QMBS, such as those in the PXP model, we observe that the correlation matrix spectrum features numerous approximate zero eigenvalues, thereby distinguishing these states. We demonstrate the effectiveness and utility of this method with several paradigmatic QMBS examples.

Title: Non-Abelian geometry, topology, and dynamics of a nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger ladder
Authors: Ziyu Zhou, Zhi-Cong Xu, Li-Jun Lang
Abstract: Non-Hermiticity naturally breaks down the adiabaticity and thus leads to non-Abelian behaviors in multi-band systems. Here, we study how non-Abelian properties emerge in non-Hermitian systems by considering a multi-band non-Hermitian model -- the nonreciprocal Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) ladder that is formed by coupling two nonreciprocal SSH chains. Under periodic boundary conditions, we analytically obtain the exact phase diagrams of the geometry of band structure classified by its complex value and gap type, and of the non-Abelian topology based on a newly defined gauge-invariant winding number under the chiral symmetry. Under open boundary conditions, we find that the bulk-boundary correspondence survives in the thermodynamic limit but breaks down for finite sizes along with the emergence of critical non-Hermitian skin effects when the inter-leg coupling is weak, where the decaying length $\xi$ of the bulk skin modes varies with the system size $L$, satisfying the scale-free power law $\xi\propto L$. Finally, we demonstrate the non-Abelian dynamics of a Bloch state subject to an external constant force in the pseudo-Hermitian symmetric regime in comparison with the non-Hermitian Wilson lines. Our work may stimulate further interests in nontrivial non-Abelian behaviors in non-Hermitian and open quantum systems.

Title: Quantum Transport and Molecular Sensing in Reduced Graphene Oxide Measured with Scanning Probe Microscopy
Authors: Julian Sutaria, Cristian Staii
Abstract: We report combined scanning probe microscopy and electrical measurements to investigate local electronic transport in reduced graphene oxide (rGO) devices. We demonstrate that quantum transport in these materials can be significantly tuned by the electrostatic potential applied with a conducting atomic force microscope (AFM) tip. Scanning gate microscopy (SGM) reveals a clear p-type response in which local gating modulates the source-drain current, while scanning impedance microscopy (SIM) indicates corresponding shifts of the Fermi level under different gating conditions. The observed transport behavior arises from the combined effects of the AFM tip induced Fermi level shifts and defect mediated scattering. These results show that resonant scattering associated with impurities or structural defects plays a central role and highlight the strong influence of local electrostatic potentials on rGO conduction. Consistent with this electrostatic control, the device also exhibits chemical gating and sensing: during exposure to electron-withdrawing molecules (acetone), the source-drain current increases reversibly and returns to baseline upon purging with air. Repeated cycles over 15 minutes show reproducible amplitudes and recovery. Using a simple transport model we estimate an increase of about 40 percent in carrier density during exposure, consistent with p-type doping by electron-accepting analytes. These findings link nanoscale electrostatic control to macroscopic sensing performance, advancing the understanding of charge transport in rGO and underscoring its promise for nanoscale electronics, flexible chemical sensors, and tunable optoelectronic devices.

Title: Stabilization of three-body resonances to bound states in a continuum
Authors: Lucas Happ, Pascal Naidon
Abstract: Three-body resonances are ubiquitous in few-body physics and are characterized by a finite lifetime before decaying into continuum states of their composing subsystems. In this work we present a theoretical study on the possibility to stabilize three-body resonances to so-called bound states in a continuum: resonances with vanishing width that do not decay. Within a simple two-channel approach we unveil the underlying mechanism and suggest that the lifetime can be varied by a continuous tuning of system parameters. The validity of our theory is illustrated in two rather different examples, a mass-imbalanced system in one dimension and a system of three identical bosons in three dimensions, relevant to Efimov physics. Crucially, for the latter we find that one of the tunable parameters to achieve a three-body bound state in a continuum is an external magnetic field, a common tunable variable in cold-atom experiments. Due to the fundamental nature of our theory, it is expected to hold in other few-body systems, possibly opening new avenues for basic studies of otherwise unstable systems, and elevating few-body systems to interesting candidates for quantum technology.

Title: Relativistic Mott transitions and finite-temperature effects of quantum criticality in Dirac semimetals
Authors: Mireia Tolosa-Simeón, Laura Classen, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Gross-Neveu-Yukawa-type models such as the chiral Ising, chiral XY, and chiral Heisenberg models, serve as effective descriptions of two-dimensional Dirac semi-metals undergoing quantum phase transitions into various symmetry-broken ordered states. Their relativistic quantum critical points govern the systems' physical behavior in the vicinity of the transition also at finite temperatures, which is strongly influenced by critical order-parameter and chiral fermion fluctuations. Here, we explore the effect of these fluctuations at zero and finite temperature, both in the Dirac phase and in the Mott phases with spontaneously broken symmetry. To that end, we set up a functional renormalization group approach, which allows us to systematically calculate the quantum phase diagrams and scaling behavior at and near quantum criticality. We explicitly estimate quantum critical exponents, calculate the quasiparticle weight of the chiral Dirac excitations, and determine the extent of the quantum critical fan. Furthermore, we expose a semi-metallic precondensation regime where order-parameter fluctuations destroy order at finite temperature and we show the related manifestation of the Coleman-Hohenberg-Mermin-Wagner theorem. For the chiral XY model, we also expose signatures of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless physics in a system that includes strong fermion fluctuations. In view of recent experimental developments on correlated phases in highly tunable two-dimensional Dirac materials, our work aims at a more comprehensive theoretical description of relativistic quantum criticality in semi-metals, including non-Dirac-liquid behavior.

Title: Spin of fractional quantum Hall neutral modes and "missing states" on a sphere
Authors: Dung Xuan Nguyen, Dam Thanh Son
Abstract: A low-energy neutral quasiparticle in a fractional quantum Hall system appears in the latter's energy spectrum on a sphere as a series of many-body excited states labeled by the angular momentum $L$ and whose energy is a smooth function of $L$ in the limit of large sphere radius. We argue that the signature of a nonvanishing spin (intrinsic angular momentum) $s$ of the quasiparticle is the absence, in this series, of states with total angular momentum less than $s$.We reinterpret the missing of certain states, observed in an exact-diagonalization calculation of the spectrum of the $\nu=7/3$ FQH state in a wide quantum well as well as in many proposed wave functions for the excited states as a consequence of the spin-2 nature of the zero-momentum magnetoroton.

Title: Moiré Superradiance in Cavity Quantum Electrodynamics with Quantum Atom Gas
Authors: Lu Zhou, Zheng-Chun Li, Keye Zhang, Zhihao Lan, Alessio Celi, Weiping Zhang
Abstract: As a novel platform for exploring exotic quantum phenomena, the moiré lattice has garnered significant interest in solid-state physics, photonics, and cold atom physics. While moiré lattices in two- and three-dimensional systems have been proposed for neutral cold atoms, the simpler one-dimensional moiré effect remains largely unexplored. We present a scheme demonstrating moiré effects in a one-dimensional cold atom-cavity coupling system, which resembles a generalized open Dicke model exhibiting superradiant phase transitions. We reveal a strong link between the phase transition critical point and the one-dimensional moiré parameter. Evidences of the one-dimensional moiré effect are explicitly explored, including cavity field spectrum, phase transition dynamics, and anomalous atomic diffusion. This work provides a new route for testing one-dimensional moiré effects with cold atoms and open new possibility of moiré metrology.

Abstract: Van der Waals materials enable the construction of atomically sharp interfaces between compounds with distinct crystal and electronic properties. This is dramatically exploited in moiré systems, where a lattice mismatch or twist between monolayers generates an emergent in-plane periodicity, giving rise to electronic properties absent in the constituent materials. In contrast, vertical superlattices, formed by stacking dissimilar materials in the out-of-plane direction on the nanometer scale, have received far less attention despite their potential to realize analogous emergent phenomena in three dimensions. Through angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and density functional theory, we investigate six-to-eight-layer transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) heterostructures constructed from pairs of stacked few-layer materials. Counterintuitively, we find that even these single superlattice units can host fully-delocalised bands, evidencing a robust coherent interlayer coupling across lattice-mismatched interfaces over extended spatial scales. We show how uncompensated semimetallic phases and energetically-mismatched topological surface states are readily and exclusively stabilized within such asymmetrical architectures. These findings establish two-component heterostructures in the intermediate layer-regime as platforms to invoke and control unprecedented combinations and instances of the diverse quantum phases native to many-layer TMDs.

Title: Towards a $\cos(2φ)$ Josephson element using aluminum junctions with well-transmitted channels

Abstract: We introduce a novel method for fabricating all-aluminum Josephson junctions with highly transmitted conduction channels. Such properties are typically associated with structures requiring intricate fabrication processes, such as atomic contacts or hybrid junctions based on semiconducting nanowires and 2D materials. In contrast, our approach relies solely on standard nanofabrication techniques. The resulting devices exhibit a key signature of high-transmission junctions - Multiple Andreev Reflections (MAR) - in their current-voltage characteristics. Furthermore, we propose a straightforward superconducting circuit design based on these junctions, enabling the implementation of a parity-protected qubit.

Title: Irreversibility of heat transport and optical non-coherence: an experimental demonstration of the analogy
Authors: Aleksandr Meilakhs, Claudio Pastorino, Miguel Larotonda
Abstract: The arrow of time problem remains one of the most intriguing questions of modern physics. We investigate one particular example of this problem: the irreversibility of heat transfer through an interface between two materials. This special case turned out to be much simpler than that of transport phenomena in bulk materials. We start by exploring a mechanism that turns equations of reversible, unitary transmission of wave-particles through the interface into irreversible equations, describing the distribution functions at the interface. This mechanism, non-coherence, is treated in an analogy with wave optics: no real waves are absolutely monochromatic and thus have finite temporal coherence. We find an experimental setup to prove the suggested mechanism and calculate the optimal parameters to observe the phenomenon. We conduct an experiment whose results fully agree with the predictions of our theory. In the final discussion, we revisit the connection with heat transport through a material interface and show that only the suggested mechanism can explain the irreversibility of interfacial transport.

Title: Topological properties of domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators
Authors: Gabriele Naselli, Ion Cosma Fulga
Abstract: Motivated by the study of stacking faults in weak topological insulators and the observation of magnetic domain walls in MnBi$_{2n}$Te$_{3n+1}$, we explore the topological properties of magnetic domain walls in antiferromagnetic topological insulators. We develop two tight-binding models for two different types of antiferromagnetic topological insulators: the first type obtained by adding antiferromagnetic order to a strong topological insulator, and another built from stacked Chern insulating layers with alternating Chern numbers. Both systems are dual topological insulators, i.e. they are at the same time antiferromagnetic and crystalline topological insulators, but differ by the type of mirror symmetry protecting the crystalline phase: spinful versus spinless. We show that in the spinful case the mirror Chern number is invariant under time reversal and that it changes sign in the spinless case. This influences the properties of the two systems in the presence of a magnetic domain wall, which we model as an interface between two regions of opposite magnetization. In the first type, the bulk of the magnetic domain wall is gapped but the defect will host chiral edge states when it ends on an external ferromagnetic surface. In the second, due to the change in the sign of the mirror Chern number, the magnetic domain wall is a two-dimensional embedded semimetal with 2D gapless states protected by mirror symmetry. Our results show that magnetic domain walls can be a source of non-trivial topology, allowing to generate and manipulate gapless states within the bulk and the ferromagnetic surfaces of antiferromagnetic topological insulators.

Title: Subsystem Symmetry-Protected Topological Phases from Subsystem SymTFT of 2-Foliated Exotic Tensor Gauge Theory
Authors: Qiang Jia, Zhian Jia
Abstract: Symmetry topological field theory (SymTFT), or topological holography, posits a correspondence between symmetries in a $d$-dimensional theory and topological order in a $(d+1)$-dimensional theory. In this work, we extend this framework to subsystem symmetries and develop subsystem SymTFT as a systematic tool to characterize and classify subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phases. For $(2+1)$D gapped phases, we introduce a 2-foliated $(3+1)$D exotic tensor gauge theory (which is equivalent to 2-foliated $(3+1)$D BF theory via exotic duality) as the subsystem SymTFT and systematically analyze its topological boundary conditions and linearly rigid subsystem symmetries. Taking subsystem symmetry groups $G = \mathbb{Z}_N$ and $G=\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ as examples, we demonstrate how to recover the classification scheme $\mathcal{C}[G] = H^{2}(G^{\times 2}, U(1)) / \left( H^2(G, U(1)) \right)^3$, which was previously derived by examining topological invariant under linear subsystem-symmetric local unitary transformations in the lattice Hamiltonian formalism. To illustrate the correspondence between field-theoretic and lattice descriptions, we further analyze $\mathbb{Z}_2 \times \mathbb{Z}_2$ and $\mathbb{Z}_N \times \mathbb{Z}_M$ cluster state models as concrete examples.

Abstract: Coherence time is a key property of quantum systems, determining how long quantum information can be preserved. In solid-state platforms, this parameter is closely linked to the lifetime of quasiparticles that can store quantum information. For decades, magnons - quasiparticles arising from collective magnetization dynamics - have exhibited lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, limiting their viability as quantum information carriers. Here, we report the discovery of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18 {\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment was performed on an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet (YIG) sphere over a wide temperature range, from ambient down to 30 mK. These results directly confirm the theoretical prediction that the magnon lifetime in an ideal YIG crystal at zero temperature is infinite, paving the way for the engineering of lossless magnetic systems in which magnons will be employed as long-lived carriers of information for quantum gates and quantum storage.

Title: Mesoscale FEM Model of Concrete: Statistical Assessment of Inherent Stress Concentrations in Dependence on Phase Heterogeneity
Authors: Jan Mašek (1 and 2), Petr Miarka (1 and 2) ((1) Institute of Physics of Materials, Czech Academy of Sciences, Brno, Czech Republic (2) Institute of Structural Mechanics, Faculty of Civil Engineering, Brno University of Technology, Brno, Czech Republic)
Abstract: Concrete heterogeneity originates from its production process, which involves bonding aggregates with a binder matrix. This study presents a mesoscale finite element model (MFEM) that offers detailed insights into the fracture process at the aggregate--cement matrix interface, focusing on one of concrete's key properties: its mechanical response. Unlike discrete models, which often average out critical stress concentrations within the mesostructure, the MFEM approach captures detailed stress distributions, revealing localized effects crucial for understanding damage evolution. Although computationally more demanding, the MFEM leverages modern high-performance computing (HPC) to provide a detailed description of the stress field and material damage across different phases and interfaces. The proposed modeling framework integrates a collision-checked aggregate generation procedure, Voronoi-based mesostructure construction, and adaptive 3D meshing, forming a reusable methodology for stress analysis in heterogeneous composites. This approach offers transparent, physically interpretable parameterization of phase properties in contrast to black-box discrete models. Another methodological contribution is the statistical post-processing of stress data using histogram-based analysis across cross-sectional planes. This enables quantitative evaluation of stress concentration distributions, providing valuable insights into the mesoscale mechanical response and serving as a useful visualization tool for researchers working on heterogeneous material modeling. Various matrix-to-aggregate stiffness ratios are considered to evaluate the influence of material heterogeneity on the stress field.

Title: Field-Free Superconducting Diode Enabled by Geometric Asymmetry and Perpendicular Magnetization
Authors: Jiaxu Li, Zijian Zhang, Shiqi Wang, Yu He, Haochang Lyu, Qiusha Wang, Bowen Dong, Daoqian Zhu, Hisakazu Matsuki, Dapeng Zhu, Guang Yang, Weisheng Zhao
Abstract: The superconducting diode effect (SDE)- manifested as directional, dissipationless supercurrents - is pivotal for realizing energy-efficient superconducting logic and memory technologies. Achieving high-efficiency SDE without external magnetic fields, however, remains a fundamental challenge. Here, we report a strongly enhanced, field-free SDE in Pt/Co/Nb heterostructures, enabled by the interplay of engineered geometric asymmetry and stray fields from a perpendicularly magnetized Co layer. This configuration promotes directional vortex entry and spatially selective pinning, yielding diode efficiencies that exceed all previously reported field-free values. Temperature- and field-dependent transport measurements, supported by micromagnetic simulations, reveal that the enhanced nonreciprocity stems from three cooperative mechanisms: asymmetric vortex entry, localized magnetic pinning, and Lorentz-force imbalance. These findings establish a scalable, CMOS-compatible platform for high-performance superconducting rectifiers, offering new opportunities for cryogenic spintronics and quantum electronics.

Title: Entropy of self-avoiding branching polymers: mean field theory and Monte Carlo simulations
Authors: Davide Marcato, Achille Giacometti, Amos Maritan, Angelo Rosa
Abstract: We study the statistics of branching polymers with excluded-volume interactions, by modeling them as single self-avoiding trees on a generic regular periodic lattice with coordination number $q$. Each lattice site can be occupied at most by one tree node, and the fraction of occupied sites can vary from dilute to dense conditions. By adopting the statistics of rooted-directed trees as a proxy for that of undirected trees without internal loops and by an exact mapping of the model into a field theory, we compute the entropy and the mean number of branch-nodes within a mean field approximation and in the thermodynamic limit. In particular, we find that the mean number of branch-nodes is independent of both the lattice details and the lattice occupation, depending only on the associated chemical potential. Monte Carlo simulations in $d=2,3,4$ provide evidence of the remarkable accuracy of the mean field theory, more accurate for higher dimensions.

Title: Incipient ionic conductors: Ion-constrained lattices achieving superionic-like thermal conductivity by extreme anharmonicity
Authors: Yongheng Li, Chunqiu Lu, Bin Wei, Cong Lu, Xingang Jiang, Daisuke Ishikawa, Taishun Manjo, Caofeng Pan, Alfred Q. R. Baron, Jiawang Hong
Abstract: Phonon liquid-like thermal conduction in the solid state enables superionic conductors to serve as efficient thermoelectric device candidates. While liquid-like motion of ions effectively suppresses thermal conductivity (\kappa), their high mobility concurrently triggers material degradation due to undesirable ion migration and consequent metal deposition, making it still a challenge to balancing low \kappa and high stability. Here, we report a superionic-like thermal transport alongside restricted long-range ion migration in CsCu_2I_3 with incipient ionic conduction, using synchrotron X-ray diffraction, inelastic X-ray scattering, and machine-learning potential-based simulations. We reveal that the Cu ions exhibit confined migration between CuI_4 tetrahedra at high temperatures, displaying extreme anharmonicity of dominated phonons beyond conventional rattling and comparable to that in superionic conductorsl. Consequently, a glass-like \kappa (~0.3 W m^{-1} K^{-1} at 300 K) following the relationship of \kappa ~ T^{0.17}, was achieved along the x-direction, where Cu ion migration is three oders of magnitude lower than in superionic conductors. These results highlight the advantage of incipient ionic conductors in simultaneously maintaining both low \kappa and high stability, elucidate the thermal transport mechanism via ion migration constraints, and pave an effective pathway toward ultralow thermal conductivity in ionic conductors.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuations in a harmonic trap with annealed stochastic stiffness
Authors: Deepak Gupta, Sabine H. L. Klapp
Abstract: We provide a comprehensive analysis of the positional dynamics and average thermodynamics of an overdamped Brownian particle subject to both, harmonic confinement and annealed disorder due to a temporarily fluctuating trap stiffness. We model this stiffness via a stationary Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process whose correlation time can be tuned from white noise to a quenched limit. We analytically calculate the positional distribution in these limits and provide exact expressions for the $n$th positional moments at finite correlation times, revealing important insights regarding stationarity. Further, we analyze the average work performed on the particle and the heat dissipated into the environment at all times, illustrating the nonequilibrium character of the system and its relaxation into a steady state. Our analytical results are validated by numerical Langevin simulations.

Title: Adiabatic protocol for the generalized Langevin equation
Authors: Pedro J. Colmenares
Abstract: This article proposes a self-consistent methodology for determining the work involved in an adiabatic process where the dynamics of a Brownian particle is trapped in an optical tweezers. Instead of varying the frequency of the trap, it is displaced through a defined protocol. Assuming the dynamics follow a modified generalized Langevin equation previously proposed by the author, it is found that the external adiabatic driving is uniquely derived in terms of the system's dynamical properties, and unlike isothermal processes, does not require optimization. There is no need to include other parameters than those characterizing the model.

Title: Electro-thermal Co-design of Vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky Diodes with High-permittivity BaTiO3 Field-plate for High-field and Thermal Management
Authors: Ahsanul Mohaimeen Audri, Chung-Ping Ho, Emerson J. Hollar, Jingjing Shi, Esmat Farzana
Abstract: This work presents electrothermal co-design of vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 Schottky barrier diodes (SBDs) to enhance both heat dissipation and high field management in high-power applications. Here, we demonstrate device-level thermal management tailored for two vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBD structures that employed different edge termination techniques, such as field-plate and deep etch with sidewall field-plate, where the field-plate was formed with high-permittivity dielectric (BaTiO3). The localized thermal hot spots were detected at the Schottky contact edges near BaTiO3 dielectric based field-plate. However, a substantial reduction of the thermal hotspots was observed by forming the field-plate with BaTiO3 and thermally-conductive AlN insulator, where the AlN can effectively decrease Joule heating at interface and the high permittivity of BaTiO3 contributes to high field reduction. The deep etch and sidewall field-plate SBD structure further reduced accumulated heat and electric field near the critical anode edge by removing lateral depletion regions. We also analyzed thermal transport at dielectric/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 interfaces using Landauer approach that revealed significantly higher thermal boundary conductance (TBC) enabled by AlN compared to BaTiO3, attesting to the superior heat dissipation ability by BaTiO3/AlN field-plate than the BaTiO3-only configuration. Experimental investigation with vertical metal/AlN/\b{eta}-Ga2O3 diodes also extracted a high breakdown field (~11 MV/cm) of AlN, significantly exceeding the material breakdown field of \b{eta}-Ga2O3. This indicates that AlN can be an excellent choice for field-plate dielectric in vertical \b{eta}-Ga2O3 SBDs to provide both enhanced high field sustainability and improved heat dissipation in high-power applications.

Title: Disorder-induced proximate quantum spin ice phase in Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$
Authors: Yi Luo, Joseph A. M. Paddison, Brenden R. Ortiz, Miles Knudtson, Stephen D. Wilson, Jue Liu, Benjamin A. Frandsen, Si Athena Chen, Matthias Frontzek, Andrey Podlesnyak, Adam A. Aczel
Abstract: We report a comprehensive bulk characterization and neutron scattering investigation of single-crystalline Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$, a magnetic pyrochlore synthesized via a flux-growth method. Unpolarized neutron diffuse scattering reveals the emergence of spin-ice correlations below $T \sim 1$ K, evidenced by the development of anisotropic pinch-point features that are consistent with quantum-spin-ice (QSI) behavior. A.C. susceptibility measurements indicate a progressive slowing of spin dynamics in this regime, culminating in complete spin freezing below $T_f \approx 0.15$ K. Inelastic neutron scattering at $T = 0.5$ K reveals a broad spectrum of quasi-elastic magnetic excitations, with intensity in the low-energy range $[0, 0.2]$ meV significantly suppressed below $T_f$. Meanwhile, an incipient (100)-type magnetic order begins to nucleate, and a gapped excitation centered at $\hbar\omega = 0.23$ meV persists. We further identify two distinct dynamical timescales above $T_f$, a slow component $\tau_{\mathrm{slow}} \sim 10^{-5}$ s and a fast component $\tau_{\mathrm{fast}} \sim 10^{-10}$ s, in quantitative agreement with theoretical predictions for QSI systems. Taken together, these results indicate that Pr$_2$Sn$_2$O$_7$ enters a disorder-induced spin-frozen phase below $T_f$, lying in close proximity to a $U(1)$ quantum spin liquid.

Authors: Ricardo Paupitz, Alexandre F. Fonseca, Mizraim Bessa, Guilherme S. L. Fabris, William F. da Cunha, Leonardo D. Machado, Marcelo L. Pereira Junior, Luiz A. Ribeiro Junior, Douglas S. Galvão
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) carbon allotropes have received considerable attention due to their unique properties and potential applications in several fields, including electronics, catalysis, energy storage, and sensing. Following the experimental realization of graphene, numerous other 2D carbon structures have been proposed and, in some cases, successfully synthesized. This work presents a concise review of the recently experimentally realized 2D carbon allotropes, including graphynes, biphenylene-based networks, fullerene networks, and monolayer amorphous carbon. For each class, we discuss structural characteristics, theoretical predictions, and synthesis methods, with emphasis on the interplay between theory and experiment. We also highlight instances where experimental studies overlooked relevant theoretical contributions. Finally, we identify theoretically predicted structures that remain unexplored experimentally, suggesting opportunities for synthesis-driven investigations.

Title: Many-Body Rashba Spin-Orbit Interaction and Exciton Spin Relaxation in Atomically Thin Semiconductor Structures
Authors: Henry Mittenzwey, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: We propose a pair spin-orbit interaction (PSOI) mechanism by establishing a mesoscopic many-particle Rashba Hamiltonian. In lowest order, this Hamiltonian self-consistently describes exciton spin relaxation in monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDC) due to local electric fields caused by spatial asymmetries in the dielectric environment. For a monolayer MoSe$_2$ on a SiO$_2$ substrate above 77 K showing a meV bright-dark splitting, the local electric field causes fast intravalley spin relaxation on a sub-picosecond timescale, whereas it is negligible for other TMDCs with larger bright-dark splitting.

Title: Design and Optimization of Spin Dynamics in Ge Quantum Dots: g-Factor Modulation, Dephasing Sweet Spots, and Phonon-Induced Relaxation
Authors: Ngoc Duong, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: Accurate modeling of spin dynamics in hole-based quantum dot qubits demands high-fidelity simulations that capture realistic device geometries, material interfaces, and self-consistent electrostatics. Here, we present a comprehensive three-dimensional study of gate-defined quantum dot hole spin qubits in strained Si$_{0.2}$Ge$_{0.8}$/Ge heterostructures. In contrast to prior work relying on idealized confinement or decoupled Poisson-Schrödinger treatments, our approach combines self-consistent electrostatics with a four-band Luttinger-Kohn Hamiltonian to resolve spin-orbit interactions, wavefunction asymmetries, and g-tensor anisotropies in realistic device structures. We quantify the impact of device size and gate bias on wavefunction localization, electric-field-induced g-factor modulation, and identify "sweet spots" in vertical electric field where g-factor sensitivity to charge noise is minimized, enhancing spin dephasing times. Spin relaxation due to phonon coupling is also modeled, revealing size-dependent T1 behavior consistent with strong Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling and a magnetic-field scaling near $B^{-8}$. This work establishes a predictive modeling framework for optimizing spin coherence in planar Ge quantum dots and provides quantitative design guidance for scalable, electrically controlled hole spin qubits in group-IV semiconductors.

Title: A foundation machine learning potential with polarizable long-range interactions for materials modelling
Authors: Rongzhi Gao, ChiYung Yam, Jianjun Mao, Shuguang Chen, GuanHua Chen, Ziyang Hu
Abstract: Long-range interactions are essential determinants of chemical system behaviour across diverse environments. We present a foundation framework that integrates explicit polarizable long-range physics with an equivariant graph neural network potential. It employs a physically motivated polarizable charge equilibration scheme that directly optimizes electrostatic interaction energies rather than partial charges. The foundation model, trained across the periodic table up to Pu, demonstrates strong performance across key materials modelling challenges. It effectively captures long-range interactions that are challenging for traditional message-passing mechanisms and accurately reproduces polarization effects under external electric fields. We have applied the model to mechanical properties, ionic diffusivity in solid-state electrolytes, ferroelectric phase transitions, and reactive dynamics at electrode-electrolyte interfaces, highlighting the model's capacity to balance accuracy and computational efficiency. Furthermore, we show that as a foundation model, it can be efficiently finetuned to achieve high-level accuracy for specific challenging systems.

Title: On Computational Complexity of Unitary and State Design Properties
Authors: Yoshifumi Nakata, Yuki Takeuchi, Martin Kliesch, Andrew Darmawan
Abstract: We investigate unitary and state $t$-designs from a computational complexity perspective. First, we address the problems of computing frame potentials that characterize (approximate) $t$-designs. We present a quantum algorithm for computing frame potentials and establish the following: (1) exact computation can be achieved by a single query to a $\# \textsf{P}$-oracle and is $\# \textsf{P}$-hard; (2) for state vectors, deciding whether the frame potential is larger than or smaller than certain values is $\textsf{BQP}$-complete, provided the promise gap between the two values is inverse-polynomial in the number of qubits; and (3) for both state vectors and unitaries, this promise problem is $\textsf{PP}$-complete if the promise gap is exponentially small. Second, we address the promise problem of deciding whether or not a given set is a good approximation to a design. Given a certain promise gap that could be constant, we show that this problem is $\textsf{PP}$-hard, highlighting the inherent computational difficulty of determining properties of unitary and state designs. We further identify the implications of our results across diverse areas, including variational methods for constructing designs, diagnosing quantum chaos through out-of-time-ordered correlators (OTOCs), and exploring emergent designs in Hamiltonian systems.

Title: Volume-law entanglement fragmentation of quasiparticles
Authors: Jiaju Zhang
Abstract: We investigate the entanglement entropy in quantum states featuring repeated sequential excitations of unit patterns in momentum space. In the scaling limit, each unit pattern contributes independently and universally to the entanglement entropy, leading to a characteristic volume-law scaling. Crucially, this universal contribution remains identical for both free and interacting models, enabling decomposition of the total entanglement into pattern-specific components. Numerical verification in fermionic and bosonic chains confirms this volume-law fragmentation phenomenon. For fermionic systems, we derive analytical expressions where many-body entanglement becomes expressible through few-body entanglement components. Notably, this analytical framework extends to spin-1/2 XXZ chains through appropriate identifications.

Title: Transport approach to quantum state tomography
Authors: Jeanne Bourgeois, Gianmichele Blasi, Géraldine Haack
Abstract: Quantum state tomography (QST) is a central task for quantum information processing, enabling quantum cryptography, computation, and state certification. Traditional QST relies on projective measurements of single- and two-qubit Pauli operators, requiring the system of interest to be isolated from environmental dissipation. In this work, we demonstrate that measuring currents and associated transport quantities flowing through a quantum system in an open configuration enable the reconstruction of its quantum state. This result relies on an exact relation between transport quantities and the Krylov subspaces associated with the Lindbladian which encodes the dynamical evolution of an open quantum system. We illustrate this transport approach to QST with the explicit example of a two-qubit system embedded in a two-terminal setup. As a direct consequence of our framework, we are able to provide a transport-based entanglement measure to certify the presence of quantum correlations, expressing the concurrence in terms of current averages and correlations function only. Our findings are analytical, providing fundamental insights into quantum information processing in open quantum systems. They establish new connections between the fields of mesoscopic physics and quantum information theory.

Title: Work Statistics via Real-Time Effective Field Theory: Application to Work Extraction from Thermal Bath with Qubit Coupling
Authors: Jhh-Jing Hong, Feng-Li Lin
Abstract: Quantum thermal states are known to be passive, as required by the second law of thermodynamics. This paper investigates the potential for work extraction by coupling a thermal bath to a qubit of either spin, fermionic, or topological type, which acts as a quantum thermal state at different temperatures. The amount of work extraction is derived from the work statistics under a cyclic nonequilibrium process. Although the work statistics of many-body systems are known to be challenging to calculate explicitly, we propose an effective field theory approach to tackle this problem by assuming the externally driven source couples to a specific quasiparticle operator of the thermal state. We show that the work statistics can be expressed succinctly in terms of this quasiparticle's thermal spectral function. We obtain the non-perturbative work distribution function (WDF) for the pure thermal bath without the qubit coupling. With qubit coupling, we get the second-order WDF, from which the physical regime of work extraction can be pinned down precisely to help devise quantum heat engines or refrigerators. Their efficiency or coefficient of performance (COP) can be inferred from the combination of the fluctuation theorem and the first law, and we find that the spin/topological qubit-bath system generally yields a far better heat engine/refrigerator than the other two alternatives due to the underlying quantum statistics.

Title: Simple Hamiltonians for Matrix Product State models
Authors: Norbert Schuch, Andras Molnar, David Perez-Garcia
Abstract: Matrix Product States (MPS) and Tensor Networks provide a general framework for the construction of solvable models. The best-known example is the Affleck-Kennedy-Lieb-Tasaki (AKLT) model, which is the ground state of a 2-body nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonian. We show that such simple parent Hamiltonians for MPS models are, in fact, much more prevalent than hitherto known: The existence of a single example with a simple Hamiltonian for a given choice of dimensions already implies that any generic MPS with those dimensions possesses an equally simple Hamiltonian. We illustrate our finding by discussing a number of models with nearest-neighbor parent Hamiltonians, which generalize the AKLT model on various levels.

Title: High-performance local decoders for defect matching in 1D
Authors: Louis Paletta, Anthony Leverrier, Mazyar Mirrahimi, Christophe Vuillot
Abstract: Local decoders, also known as cellular-automaton decoders, offer a promising path toward real-time quantum error correction by replacing centralized classical decoding, with inherent hardware constraints, by a natively parallel and streamlined architecture from a simple local transition rule. We propose two new types of local decoders for the quantum repetition code in one dimension. The signal-rule decoders interpret odd parities between neighboring qubits as defects, attracted to each other via the exchange of classical point-like excitations, represented by a few bits of local memory. We prove the existence of a threshold in the code-capacity model and present numerical evidence of exponential logical error suppression under a phenomenological noise model, with data and measurement errors at each error correction cycle. Compared to previously known local decoders that suffer from sub-optimal threshold and scaling, our construction significantly narrows the gap with global decoders for practical system sizes and error rates. Implementation requirements can be further reduced by eliminating the need for local classical memories, with a new rule defined on two rows of qubits. This shearing-rule works well at relevant system sizes making it an appealing short-term solution. When combined with biased-noise qubits, such as cat qubits, these decoders enable a fully local quantum memory in one dimension.

Title: Universal dissipators for driven open quantum systems and the correction to linear response
Authors: Lorenzo Bernazzani, Balázs Gulácsi, Guido Burkard
Abstract: We investigate in parallel two common pictures used to describe quantum systems interacting with their surrounding environment, i.e., the stochastic Hamiltonian description, where the environment is implicitly included in the fluctuating internal parameters of the system, and the explicit inclusion of the environment via the time-convolutionless projection operator method. Utilizing these two different frameworks, we show that the dissipator characterizing the dynamics of the reduced system, determined up to second order in the noise strength or bath-system coupling, is composed of two parts. One is universal, meaning that it keeps the same form regardless of the drive term. This form constitutes the relevant part of the dissipator only as long as the drive is weak. We thoroughly discuss the assumptions on which this treatment is based and its limitations. Then, by considering the first non-vanishing higher-order term in our expansion, we derive the other, drive-dependent, term completing the full dissipator. This part of the dissipator, originating from the third cumulant, is usually neglected when modeling the decoherent dynamics of controlled qubits. However, this further term constitutes the linear response correction due to memory-mediated environmental effects in driven-dissipative quantum systems. Also, it notably shows that the structure of our quantum master equation goes beyond the Lindblad form. The Lindblad form is recovered for memory-less baths. Finally, we demonstrate this technique to be highly accurate for the problems of dephasing in a driven qubit and for the theory of pseudo-modes for quantum environments.

Title: Spin-qubit readout analysis based on a hidden Markov model
Authors: Maria Spethmann, Peter Stano, Daniel Loss
Abstract: Across most qubit platforms, the readout fidelities do not keep up with the gate fidelities, and new ways to increase the readout fidelities are searched for. For semiconductor spin qubits, a typical qubit-readout signal consists of a finite stretch of a digitized charge-sensor output. Such a signal trace is usually analyzed by compressing it into a single value, either maximum or sum. The binary measurement result follows by comparing the single value to a decision threshold fixed in advance. This threshold method, while simple and fast, omits information that could potentially improve the readout fidelity. Here, we analyze what can be achieved by more sophisticated signal-trace processing using the hidden Markov model (HMM). The HMM is a natural choice, being the optimal statistical processing if the noise is white. It also has a computationally efficient implementation, known as the forward-backward algorithm, making HMM processing practical. However, unlike in many computer-simulation studies, in real experiments the noise is correlated. How this change affects the HMM implementation and reliability is our subject. We find that the HMM using white noise as the system statistical model is surprisingly sensitive to correlations; it only tolerates very small correlation times. We suggest alleviating this deficiency by a signal prefiltering. The correlations have a similar strongly negative impact on the HMM model calibration (the Baum-Welch algorithm). Besides studying the effects of noise correlations, as a specific application of the HMM we calculate the readout fidelity at elevated temperatures, relevant to recent experimental pursuits of hot spin qubits.

Title: A Generalized Crystalline Equivalence Principle
Authors: Devon Stockall, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We prove a general version of the crystalline equivalence principle which gives an equivalence of categories between a category of TQFTs defined on a generic space with $G$-symmetry, and a category of TQFTs with internal symmetry. We give a definition and classification of anomalies associated to TQFTs in the presence of spatial symmetry, which we then generalize to a definition of an anomaly for a categorical symmetry.

Title: Simultaneous generation and transfer of mechanical noise squeezing
Authors: Mungyeong Jeong, Hyojun Seok, Young-Sik Ra, Junho Suh
Abstract: Optomechanical interactions between mechanical oscillators and an electromagnetic field induce controllable modifications in mechanical fluctuation. When multiple mechanical oscillators are coupled to a single electromagnetic mode, these interactions can be extended to utilize the electromagnetic mode as a mediator for distributing noise squeezing among different mechanical oscillators. We investigate the transfer of mechanical noise squeezing between two mechanical modes, enabled by a single microwave cavity mode which is strongly coupled to both mechanical modes. Noise squeezing in one mechanical mode (control) is achieved through parametric modulation of its resonance frequency via the optical spring effect. Simultaneously, optomechanical beam-splitter interaction is applied between the mechanical modes to transfer noise squeezing from the control mode to the other mode (target). Strong correlations between the quadratures of the two mechanical modes confirm that the observed squeezing in the target mode originates from the squeezing in the control mode. Remarkably, the observed squeezing transfer manifests noise characteristics of both single-mode and two-mode squeezing. This unique feature suggests that the squeezing transfer holds significant potential for enhancing precision measurements.
