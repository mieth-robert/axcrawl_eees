Title: Probing microsecond dynamics of disperse nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using nanometer localization precision total-internal-reflection dark-field microscopy
Authors: Anne Y. Schumacher
Abstract: Particles at fluid-fluid interfaces have a wide range of important applications in industry, technology and science. Questions remain about what governs adsorption dynamics and inter-particle interactions, and how mixtures -- both of different-sized particles, and particles and surfactants -- behave. I probe the dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces using high-speed total-internal-reflection dark-field (TIR-DF) microscopy, comparing gold particles of diameters 20, 40 and 80 nanometers, and investigating the effect of an added surfactant. I built a TIR-DF microscope with a spatiotemporal resolution of up to 1 nanometer at 20 microseconds, and characterized the particle motion by direct imaging for the diffusive motion within the interfacial plane, and attenuation of light scattering and in-plane motion for out-of-plane motion. The addition of surfactant was found to qualitatively alter the interaction between the particles and the interface: Adsorptions became reversible and the size trend in diffusivity was reversed (larger particles diffused faster than smaller ones). The combination of this and the rarity of adsorption events of larger particles leads me to propose size-dependent barriers to adsorption at surfactant interfaces. In addition, at surfactant interfaces, many particles' diffusive behavior changed over the course of a trajectory, indicating several different immersion states that are stable on the experimental timescale (approximately 1 second). This study shows that there remain qualitatively new dynamics of nanoparticles at oil-water interfaces to be explored. These dynamics can only be resolved at a high spatial resolution, and many of them only at high imaging speed, underlining the importance of novel imaging approaches probing the barriers of achievable spatiotemporal resolution.

Title: Instabilities and turbulence in extensile swimmer suspensions
Authors: Purnima Jain, Navdeep Rana, Roberto Benzi, Prasad Perlekar
Abstract: We study low Reynolds number turbulence in a suspension of polar, extensile, self-propelled inertial swimmers. We review the bend and splay mechanisms that destabilize an ordered flock. The suspension is always unstable to bend perturbations. Using a minimal 1D model, we show that the splay-stable to splay-unstable transition occurs via a supercritical Hopf bifurcation. We perform high-resolution numerical simulations in 2D to study the varieties of turbulence present in this system transitioning from defect turbulence to concentration-wave turbulence depending on a single non-dimensional number, denoting the ratio of the splay-concentration wavespeed to the swimmer motility.

Title: Scaling of Structure and Dynamics in Molecular Liquids: Insights from Pressure Experiments and Molecular Dynamics
Authors: Erik Lørup
Abstract: The overall goal of this thesis is to investigate the connection between the dynamics and structure of molecular glass formers, by testing different scaling laws for both. The inspiration for this work is the Isomorph theory because it predicts a connection between structure and dynamics. The fundamental prediction of the Isomorph Theory is that there exist lines in the phase diagram where both structure and dynamics are invariant when presented in reduced units. The prediction of constant dynamics has been tested and confirmed experimentally several times, but the structural prediction has never been confirmed experimentally. In this thesis, we have investigated the structural prediction for liquids where the prediction of constant dynamics has been shown experimentally.

Title: Superconducting Photocurrent and Light Enriched Supercurrent Phase Relation
Authors: Oles Matsyshyn, Justin C. W. Song
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric superconductors are expected to exhibit DC photocurrents even for irradiation frequencies below the superconducting gap. Such superconducting photocurrent are non-dissipative and track the quantum geometry of the superconducting state. Here we argue that superconducting photocurrent drives changes to the constitutive superconducting current phase relation (CPR) manifesting in a light controlled inductive response as well as altering the critical current. For chiral incident light, we find that superconducting photocurrent can transform reciprocal CPR into a non-reciprocal CPR producing a non-reciprocal inductance and light-controlled superconducting diode effect. These provide a protocol for measuring superconducting photocurrent and new tools for mapping the quantum geometry and order parameter of superconductors.

Title: Entanglement switching via mobility edges in a quasiperiodic chain
Authors: YouYoung Joung, Junmo Jeon, SungBin Lee
Abstract: We propose quasiperiodic chains with tunable mobility edge physics, as a promising platform for engineering long-range quantum entanglement. Using the generalized Aubry-André model, we show that the mobility edges play a key role in manipulating long-range indirect interactions in these systems. Near the mobility edge, critical states exhibit unexpectedly strong correlations between sites that share similar local structures, regardless of their spatial separation. Remarkably, by tuning the mobility edge across the Fermi level, one can induce both adiabatic transport and abrupt switching of entanglement between distant sites. These results highlight the potential of aperiodic structures for controlling nonlocal quantum correlations, opening new avenues for entanglement-based applications in quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Spin-orbital magnetism in moiré Wigner molecules
Authors: Ahmed Khalifa, Rokas Veitas, Francisco Machado, Shubhayu Chatterjee
Abstract: The interplay of spin and orbital degrees of freedom offers a versatile playground for the realization of a variety of correlated phases of matter. However, the types of spin-orbital interactions are often limited and challenging to tune. Here, we propose and analyze a new platform for spin-orbital interactions based upon a lattice of Wigner molecules in moire transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Leveraging the spin-orbital degeneracy of the low-energy Hilbert space of each Wigner molecule, we demonstrate that TMD materials can host a general spin-orbital Hamiltonian that is tunable via the moiré superlattice spacing and dielectric environments. We study the phase diagram for this model, revealing a rich landscape of phases driven by spin-orbital interactions, ranging from ferri-electric valence bond solids to a helical spin liquid. Our work establishes moiré Wigner molecules in TMD materials as a prominent platform for correlated spin-orbital phenomena

Title: Strange metal and Fermi arcs from disordering spin stripes
Authors: Xu Zhang, Nick Bultinck
Abstract: We revisit the effective theory for fluctuating spin stripes coupled to a Fermi surface, and consider the parameter regime where a spin nematic phase intervenes between the spin density wave state and the symmetric state. It is shown that adding potential disorder to this theory, which acts as an unconventional type of random-field disorder, naturally gives rise to the universal theory of strange metals with spatial disorder in both the magnitude and sign of the electron-boson coupling term [A.A. Patel, H. Guo, I. Esterlis and S. Sachdev, Science 381, 790 (2023)]. One difference compared to the original theory, however, is that at non-zero temperatures the disordered spin-stripe model automatically self-averages over the sign of the coupling. We also study the effects of thermal fluctuations in a phenomenological model for the disordered spin density wave state, and find from Monte Carlo simulations that a short anti-ferromagnetic correlation length (order 4-5 lattice constants) already leads to pronounced Fermi arcs in the electronic spectral weight.

Title: Spin precession and laser-induced spin-polarized photocurrents
Authors: Esteban A. Rodríguez-Mena, Matías Berdakin, Luis E. F. Foa Torres
Abstract: Controlling spin currents in topological insulators (TIs) is crucial for spintronics but challenged by the robustness of their chiral edge states, which impedes the spin manipulation required for devices like spin-field effect transistors (SFETs). We theoretically demonstrate that this challenge can be overcome by synergistically applying circularly polarized light and gate-tunable Rashba spin-orbit coupling (rSOC) to a 2D TI. Laser irradiation provides access to Floquet sidebands where rSOC induces controllable spin precession, leading to the generation of one-way, switchable spin-polarized photocurrents, an effect forbidden in equilibrium TIs. This mechanism effectively realizes SFET functionality within a driven TI, specifically operating within a distinct Floquet replica, offering a new paradigm for light-based control in topological spintronics.

Title: Enhanced Andreev Reflection in Flat-Band Systems: Wave Packet Dynamics, DC Transport and the Josephson Effect
Authors: Sarbajit Mazumdar, Anamitra Mukherjee, Kush Saha, Sourin Das
Abstract: We investigate Andreev reflection (AR) in a proximity-induced normal-superconductor (NS) junction within the extended $\alpha-\mathcal{T}_3$ lattice, emphasizing the impact of flat bands on AR. Our findings reveal that flat bands significantly enhance AR. Through wave packet dynamics, we track the real-time evolution of quasi-particle wave packets across the junction, providing deeper insight into electron-hole conversion. Notably, the combination of band flatness and anisotropic dispersion in the $k_x-k_y$ plane induces an electronic analog of Goos-Hänchen (GH) shifts at the NS interface, exhibiting directional asymmetry along the junction. This asymmetry leads to a Hall-like response in Josephson junction in SNS geometry, where transport across the junction region is dominated by the quasi-flat bands.

Title: Thermal Transport and Application Reassessment of ThSi$_2$N$_4$ Monolayer: From FET Channel to Thermoelectric Material
Authors: Maryam Mirzaei Farshmi, Seyedeh Ameneh Bahadori, Zahra Shomali
Abstract: The two-dimensional M$_2$Z$_4$ materials are proposed as suitable replacements for silicon channels in field-effect transistors (FETs). In the present work, the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer from the family, with the very appropriate electron mobility, is thermally investigated using the non-equilibrium Monte Carlo simulation of the phonon Boltzmann transport equation. The reliability of the MOSFET with the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ channel has been reassessed and determined to be low due to the high maximum temperature achieved. The phonon analysis is performed and reveals that the dominant contribution of fast and energetic LA and also slow and low energy ZA phonons alongside the minor participation of the TA phonons is responsible for the peak temperature rise reaching 800 K. This finding presents that the ThSi$_2$N$_4$ monolayer is not a good candidate for replacing as silicon channel but alternatively is capable of generating a significant temperature gradient, which makes it, a suitable candidate for using as a thermoelectric material in thermoelectric generators.

Title: Terahertz field-induced metastable magnetization near criticality in FePS3
Authors: Batyr Ilyas, Tianchuang Luo, Alexander von Hoegen, Emil Viñas Boström, Zhuquan Zhang, Jaena Park, Junghyun Kim, Je-Geun Park, Keith A. Nelson, Angel Rubio, Nuh Gedik
Abstract: Controlling the functional properties of quantum materials with light has emerged as a frontier of condensed-matter physics, leading to the discovery of various light-induced phases of matter, such as superconductivity, ferroelectricity, magnetism and charge density waves. However, in most cases, the photoinduced phases return to equilibrium on ultrafast timescales after the light is turned off, limiting their practical applications. Here we use intense terahertz pulses to induce a metastable magnetization with a remarkably long lifetime of more than 2.5 milliseconds in the van der Waals antiferromagnet FePS3. The metastable state becomes increasingly robust as the temperature approaches the antiferromagnetic transition point, suggesting that critical order parameter fluctuations play an important part in facilitating the extended lifetime. By combining first-principles calculations with classical Monte Carlo and spin dynamics simulations, we find that the displacement of a specific phonon mode modulates the exchange couplings in a manner that favours a ground state with finite magnetization near the Néel temperature. This analysis also clarifies how the critical fluctuations of the dominant antiferromagnetic order can amplify both the magnitude and the lifetime of the new magnetic state. Our discovery demonstrates the efficient manipulation of the magnetic ground state in layered magnets through non-thermal pathways using terahertz light and establishes regions near critical points with enhanced order parameter fluctuations as promising areas to search for metastable hidden quantum states.

Title: Tuning of electronic properties in highly lattice-mismatched epitaxial SmN
Authors: K.D. Vallejo, V. Buturlim, Z. Cresswell, B. Campbell, B.G. Duersch, B.J. May, K. Gofryk
Abstract: We demonstrate that the electronic properties of epitaxial SmN thin films can be effectively tuned during growth by controlling the synthesis parameters. By carefully adjusting these parameters, we are able to drive SmN from an insulating ferromagnetic state to a ferromagnetic metallic state. However, no signatures of previously reported superconductivity were observed down to 0.35 K, even in the most conductive samples. We discuss possible scenarios for the absence of superconductivity in these films and examine implications for the underlying pairing mechanism in this material. These findings open a new pathway for the epitaxial engineering of multifunctional materials, enabling the monolithic integration of diverse electronic phases, such as ferromagnetism and metallicity, without the lattice mismatch and strain typically associated with heteroepitaxial growth of dissimilar materials.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particles and thermal noise
Authors: Victor Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We contrast this motion with the motion of a quantum particle in a potential which varies randomly in space and in time, which could also be thought of as (possibly thermal) noise. We calculate expectations of observables both linear and nonlinear in the density matrix. We demonstrate explicitly that while linear observables cannot distinguish between random measurements and random noise, measurable distinctions can be seen in nonlinear observables.

Title: Bilayer graphene as a template for manufacturing novel 2D materials
Authors: Arkady V. Krasheninnikov, Yung-Chang Lin, Kazu Suenaga
Abstract: Recent intensive research on two-dimensional materials (2DMs) rekindle the interest in the intercalation of various atoms and molecules into layered compounds as a tool to manufacture 2DMs and tune their optoelectronic, magnetic and catalytic properties. Intercalation into free-standing bilayer graphene (BLG) has received special attention, as graphene is stable, chemically inert and enables one to study the atomic structure of the intercalated 2DM using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy. It was also discovered that the protecting action of graphene sheets makes it possible to not only stabilize the encapsulated single sheets of marginally stable layered materials, but also synthesize completely new 2D systems inside BLG, which in comparison to the bulk graphite allows for easier intercalation and much larger increase in the inter-layer separation of the sheets. In this review, we summarize the recent progress in this area, with a special focus on new materials created inside BLG. We compare the experimental findings to the theoretical predictions, pay special attention to the discrepancies and outline the challenges in the field. Finally, we discuss unique opportunities offered by the intercalation into 2DMs beyond graphene and their heterostructures.

Title: Hot Phonon Bottlenecks and the Role of Non-Equilibrium Acoustic Phonons in III-V Multi-Quantum Well Systems
Authors: Izak Baranowski, Dragica Vasileska, Ian R. Sellers, Stephen M. Goodnick
Abstract: The hot phonon bottleneck effect is a promising mechanism for the realization of a true hot carrier solar cell. Prior work has assumed that the acoustic phonons created via decay of polar longitudinal optical (LO) phonons are assumed to quickly leave the system or thermalize quickly due to multi-phonon processes. The present work furthers the models of previous work to include a build-up of longitudinal acoustic phonons in addition to LO phonons due via the Klemens process. By including this additional process, nonphysical assumptions concerning the LO anharmonic lifetime are no longer required, resulting in a better explanation of the experimental results, and pointing towards new approaches in achieving high carrier temperatures during photo-excitation.

Title: Gap reopening as signature of coupling between Majorana zero modes in Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3-based Josephson trijunctions
Authors: Duolin Wang, Xiang Zhang, Yunxiao Zhang, Heng Zhang, Fucong Fei, Xiang Wang, Bing Li, Xiaozhou Yang, Yukun Shi, Zhongmou Jia, Enna Zhuo, Yuyang Huang, Anqi Wang, Zenan Shi, Zhaozheng Lyu, Xiaohui Song, Peiling Li, Bingbing Tong, Ziwei Dou, Jie Shen, Guangtong Liu, Fanming Qu, Fengqi Song, Li Lu
Abstract: In the past two decades, enormous efforts have been made to search for possible platforms and schemes to implement topological quantum computation (TQC). In exploring the Fu-Kane scheme of TQC based on Josephson trijunctions constructed on topological insulators, the expected Majorana phase diagram of a single trijunction has been experimentally verified. If Majorana zero modes indeed exist in this kind of trijunctions, coupling between them in multiple trijunction devices would be further expected. In this study, we fabricated Josephson devices containing two adjacent Josephson trijunctions on the surface of Sn-(Bi,Sb)2(Te,S)3, and observed that the minigap reopens for both trijunctions in their phase spaces where a closure would otherwise be expected if the trijunctions existed independently. Our findings would provide new experimental support for the validity of the Fu-Kane theory and instill further confidence in advancing along the TQC scheme proposed by Fu and Kane.

Title: Effects of multiple cycles on the resistance distance of a strand in a homogeneous polymer network
Authors: Erica Uehara, Tetsuo Deguchi
Abstract: We show that the resistance distance between a pair of adjacent vertices in a phantom network generated randomly by a Monte-Carlo method depends on the existence of short cycles around it. Here we assume that phantom networks have no fixed points but their centers of mass are located at a point. The resistance distance corresponds to the mean-square deviation of the end-to-end vector along the strand connecting the adjacent vertices. We generate random networks with fixed valency $f$ but different densities of short cycles via a Metropolis method that rewires edges among four vertices chosen randomly. In the process the cycle rank is conserved. However, the densities of short cycles are determined by the rate of randomization $kT$ which appears in the acceptance ratio $\exp(-\Delta U/kT)$ of rewiring. If a strand has few short cycles around itself, the mean squared deviation of the strand is equal to $2/f$. If it is part of a short cycle, i.e., the network has a short loop which consists of a sequence of strands including the given strand itself, its resistance distance is smaller than $2/f$, while if it is not included in a cycle but adjacent to cycles, its resistance distance is larger than $2/f$. We show it via an electrical circuit analogy of the network. Moreover, we numerically show that the effect of multiple cycles on the resistance distance is expressed as a linear combination of the effects of isolated single cycles. It follows that cycles independently have an effect on the fluctuation properties of a strand in a polymer network.

Title: High Proton Conductivity of HxWO3 at Intermediate Temperatures: Unlocking Its Application as a Mixed Ionic-Electronic Conductor
Authors: Rantaro Matsuo, Tomoyuki Yamasaki, Takahisa Omata
Abstract: Hydrogen tungsten bronzes (HxWO3), known for their mixed protonic-electronic conduction near room temperature, are extensively studied for electrochromic and gasochromic applications. However, their proton transport properties at elevated temperatures, particularly in the intermediate-temperature range (200-500 °C), remain unexplored. This study revealed the proton transport behavior of HxWO3, focusing on its potential as a proton-conducting mixed ionic-electronic conductor (MIEC) for intermediate-temperature electrochemical applications. By employing a proton-conducting phosphate glass as an electron-blocking electrode, we selectively measured the partial proton conductivity of sintered HxWO3. Hydrogen incorporation into the sintered WO3 pellet was found to occur preferentially near the surface, forming an approximately 500-micrometer-thick hydrogen-rich region. This region reached a composition of x = 0.24 and exhibited proton conductivity exceeding 10^-1 S/cm at 275 °C, well above those of state-of-the-art perovskite proton conductors. Impedance spectroscopy revealed distinct features of proton transport, including an isotope effect. The proton diffusion coefficient was 100-1000 times greater than that of H0.0001TiO2, which exhibits mixed protonic-electronic conduction via hydrogen dissolution. The larger proton diffusion coefficient of H0.24WO3 suggests that large polaron formation enhances proton this http URL findings unlock new functionality of HxWO3 as a MIEC in the intermediate-temperature range, paving the way for the development of next-generation hydrogen energy conversion systems.

Title: Algebraic States in Continuum in $ d\gt 1$ Dimensional Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Ao Yang, Kai Zhang, Chen Fang
Abstract: We report the existence of algebraically localized eigenstates embedded within the continuum spectrum of 2D non-Hermitian systems with a single impurity. These modes, which we term algebraic states in continuum (AICs), decay algebraically as $1/|r|$ from the impurity site, and their energies lie within the bulk continuum spectrum under periodic boundary conditions. We analytically derive the threshold condition for the impurity strength required to generate such states. Remarkably, AICs are forbidden in Hermitian systems and in 1D non-Hermitian systems, making them unique to non-Hermitian systems in two and higher dimensions. To detect AICs, we introduce a local density of states as an experimental observable, which is readily accessible in photonic/acoustic platforms.

Title: Observation of Macroscopic Nonlocal Voltage and Hydrodynamic Electron Flow at Room Temperature
Authors: Jae Ho Jeon, Sahng-Kyoon Jerng, Hong Ryeol Na, Seyoung Kwon, Sungkyun Park, Kang Rok Choe, Jun Sung Kim, Sangmin Ji, Taegeun Yoon, Young Jae Song, Dirk Wulferding, Jeong Kim, Hwayong Noh, Seung-Hyun Chun
Abstract: Imagine three resistors connected in series. Normally when a battery is connected across the center resistor, the side resistors remain silent with no current flow and no voltage across. Nonlocal voltage is the exceptional potential difference observed at the side resistors. Here, we report sub-V level nonlocal voltages at room temperature, from mm-scale devices comprised of nominal Bi2Se3 on YBa2Cu3O7. They also display extremely nonlinear current-voltage characteristics, potential peaks at current contacts, and negative resistances, suggesting the macroscopic electron hydrodynamics as the origin of nonlocal voltages. Similar observations in Bi2Te3 on YBa2Cu3O7 suggest an unprecedented quantum phase in chemically-modified topological insulators. Vanishing differential resistance may find applications in energy saving transport.

Title: Material realization of spinless, covalent-type Dirac semimetals in three dimensions
Authors: Yuki Tanaka, Rinsuke Yamada, Manabu Sato, Motoaki Hirayama, Max Hirschberger
Abstract: Realization of a three-dimensional (3D) analogue of graphene has been a central challenge in topological materials science. Graphene is stabilized by covalent bonding unlike conventional spin-orbit type 3D Dirac semimetals (DSMs). In this study, we demonstrate the material realization of covalent-type 3D DSMs $R_8$Co$X_3$ stabilized by covalent bonding. We observe that the carrier mobility $\mu$ of Dirac fermions reaches 3,000$\,\mathrm{cm^2/Vs}$ even in polycrystalline samples, and $\mu$ increases with the inverse of the Fermi energy, evidencing significant contributions to charge transport from Dirac electrons. $R_8$Co$X_3$ provides a material platform for exploration of Dirac electrons in three dimensions with wide chemical tunability.

Title: Origin of persistent photoconductivity in surface conducting hydrogenated diamond films
Authors: N. Mohasin Sulthana, K. Ganesan, P.K. Ajikumar
Abstract: The p-type surface conductivity of hydrogen-terminated diamond (HD) has opened up new possibilities for the development of diamond-based electronic devices. However, the origin of the persistent photoconductivity (PPC) observed in surface-conducting HD remains unclear, an understanding that is crucial for advancing HD-based optoelectronic technologies. In this study, we investigate the underlying mechanism of PPC in surface-conducting HD films. A systematic analysis was performed by tuning the carrier density via partial oxygen termination using an ozonation process. With increasing O-termination, both the decay time and the recombination barrier of photoexcited electron-hole pairs were found to decrease significantly, from 232 to 5 seconds, and from ~ 150 to 54 meV, respectively. Temperature-dependent measurements reveal that PPC in HD is influenced by random local potential fluctuations, which delay the recombination of photoexcited carriers. Furthermore, the observed PPC behavior is closely associated with percolative transport processes within the HD film. Importantly, the dependence of PPC on sheet carrier density is correlated with Coulomb interactions between the two-dimensional hole gas and the surface adsorbate layer. This study offers new insights into the PPC mechanism in surface-conducting HD films, contributing to the broader understanding necessary for the design of advanced diamond-based optoelectronic devices.

Title: A time-reversal invariant vortex in topological superconductors and gravitational $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology
Authors: Kazuki Yamamoto, Naoto Kan, Hidenori Fukaya
Abstract: We study a topological superconductor in the presence of a time-reversal invariant vortex. The eigenmodes of the Bogoliubov-de-Genne (BdG) Hamiltonian show a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topology: the time-reversal invariant vortex with odd winding number supports a pair of helical Majorana zero-modes at the vortex and the edge, while there is no such zero-modes when the winding number is even. We find that this $\mathbb{Z}_2$ structure can be interpreted as an emergent gravitational effect. Identifying the gap function as spatial components of the vielbein in 2 +1-dimensional gravity theory, we can explicitly convert the BdG equation into the Dirac equation coupled to a nontrivial gravitational background. We find that the gravitational curvature is induced at the vortex core, with its total flux quantized in integer multiples of $\pi$, reflecting the $\mathbb{Z}_2$ topological structure. Although the curvature vanishes everywhere except at the vortex core, the fermionic spectrum remains sensitive to the total curvature flux, owing to the gravitational Aharonov-Bohm effect.

Title: Enhanced superconductivity via layer differentiation in trilayer Hubbard model
Authors: Xun Liu, Mi Jiang
Abstract: Motivated by the highest superconducting transition temperature ($T_c$) in multilayer cuprates,we investigated the trilayer Hubbard model by adopting the large-scale dynamical cluster quantum Monte Carlo simulations. Focusing on the systems with higher hole dopings within the two outer layers (OL) than the inner layer (IL), which is believed to be relevant to the realistic multilayer cuprates, our exploration discovered that the IL and OL manifest strong differentiation in a wide range of hole doping combinations. Specifically, the OLs remain metallic while the IL shows a distinct transition from the pseudogap to superconducting state. More importantly, the highest $T_c$ of the composite trilayer system can be largely enhanced compared to the single layer model and the imbalanced hole dopings between IL and OL is beneficial to the global SC. We further provide strong numerical evidence on the picture that the IL itself can drive the $d$-wave superconductivity while the OLs only serve as the charge reservoir. Our investigation provides new insight into the origin of highest $T_c$ in multilayer cuprates.

Title: The quantum Mpemba effect in long-range spin systems
Authors: Shion Yamashika, Filiberto Ares
Abstract: One of the manifestations of the quantum Mpemba effect (QME) is that a tilted ferromagnet exhibits faster restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry after a quantum quench when starting from a larger tilt angle. This phenomenon has recently been observed experimentally in an ion trap that simulates a long-range spin chain. However, the underlying mechanism of the QME in the presence of long-range interactions remains unclear. Using the time-dependent spin-wave theory, we investigate the dynamical restoration of the spin-rotational symmetry and the QME in generic long-range spin systems. We show that quantum fluctuations of the magnetization drive the restoration of symmetry by melting the initial ferromagnetic order and are responsible for the QME. We find that this effect occurs across a wide parameter range in long-range systems, in contrast to its absence in some short-range counterparts.

Title: Unconventional Magnetism, Sliding Ferroelectricity, and Magneto-Optical Kerr Effects in a Multiferroic Bilayer
Authors: Chen Xinfeng, Ding Ning, Paolo Barone, Carlo Rizza, Shuai Dong, Wei Ren, Paolo G. Radaelli, Gaoyang Gou, Alessandro Stroppa
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AFM) materials offer a promising platform for exploring novel couplings between altermagnetic (AM) spin-splitting and magneto-optical Kerr effect (MOKE), with potential applications in next-generation quantum technologies. In this work, first-principles calculations, symmetry analysis, and kp modeling are employed to demonstrate how interlayer sliding in AFM multiferroic bilayers enables engineering of the electronic, magnetic, and magneto-optical properties. This study reveals an unprecedented dimension-driven AM crossover, where the 2D paraelectric (PE) bilayer exhibits spin-degenerate bands protected by the [C2||Mc] spin-space symmetry, while the 3D counterpart manifests AM spin-splitting along kz not equal to 0 paths. Furthermore, interlayer sliding breaks the Mc symmetry and stabilizes a ferroelectric (FE) state characterized by compensated ferrimagnetism and a Zeeman effect, which produces non-relativistic spin-split bands. In the FE phase, the inclusion of spin-orbit coupling (SOC) lifts accidental degeneracies, creating `alternating' spin-polarized bands due to the interplay of Zeeman and Rashba effects. Crucially, the spin polarization, ferro-valley polarization, and Kerr angle are simultaneously reversible by switching either interlayer sliding or the Neel vector. These findings highlight the rich coupling between electronic, magnetic, and optical orders in sliding multiferroics, thereby paving the way for ultra-low-power spintronics and optoelectronic devices.

Title: Phase Retrieval of Highly Strained Bragg Coherent Diffraction Patterns using Supervised Convolutional Neural Network
Authors: Matteo Masto, Vincent Favre-Nicolin, Steven Leake, Clement Atlan, Marie-Ingrid Richard, Tobias Schülli, Ewen Bellec
Abstract: In Bragg Coherent Diffraction Imaging (BCDI), Phase Retrieval of highly strained crystals is often challenging with standard iterative algorithms. This computational obstacle limits the potential of the technique as it precludes the reconstruction of physically interesting highly-strained particles. Here, we propose a novel approach to this problem using a supervised Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) trained on 3D simulated diffraction data to predict the corresponding reciprocal space phase. This method allows to fully exploit the potential of the CNN by mapping functions within the same space and leveraging structural similarities between input and output. The final object is obtained by the inverse Fourier transform of the retrieved complex diffracted amplitude and is then further refined with iterative algorithms. We demonstrate that our model outperforms standard algorithms on highly strained simulated data not included in the training set, as well as on experimental data.

Title: Symmetry Analysis of Magnetoelectric Coupling Effect in All Point Groups
Authors: Xinhai Tu, Di Wang, Hanjing Zhou, Songsong Yan, Huimei Liu, Hongjun Xiang, Xiangang Wan
Abstract: Symmetry analysis provides crucial insights into the magnetoelectric coupling effect in type-II multiferroics. In this Letter, we comprehensively investigate couplings between electric polarization and inhomogeneous magnetization across all 32 crystallographic point groups using a phenomenological Landau theory. Our theory successfully explains the ferroelectric polarizations in all known type-II multiferroics characterized by incommensurate magnetic orders. In addition, we predict 12 promising type-II multiferroic candidates with the highest magnetic transition temperature of 84 K through systematic screening of MAGNDATA database. Furthermore, we find that the collinear spin-sinusoidal texture emerges as a previously unrecognized source of ferroelectric polarization. We also demonstrate that topological ferroelectric vortex states can be induced by ferromagnetic vortex configurations in uniaxial point groups, opening a route to realizing coexisting multiple-vortex states in multiferroics.

Title: Organic Electronic Classifiers for Sensing
Authors: Sébastien Pecqueur
Abstract: This monograph describes nine years of research carried out at the Institute for Electronics, Micro-electronics and Nanotechnologies (IEMN), developed around defining a generic concept for detection, filling a void between metrological sensors and biological senses, sensing an environment's qualities along with their measurable properties in information generation technologies. The first chapter introduces fundamental notions of recognition for complex environments, such as for their chemistry, for which organic semiconductors can embed two new functionalities in consumer electronics. The second and third chapters mostly summarize contributions to the state-of-the-art literature on these matters: in the second chapter, on studying conducting polymers as both chemical detectors and conductimetric transducers, and the third chapter, on studying electropolymerization sensitivity to conceptualize evolutionary electronics. The fourth chapter presents several results on the conception of several "classifiers" exploiting both functionalities: in tasks aiming at integrating different sensitivities at a very small scale, at broadening sensing devices' receptive fields based on experience, and at physically engraving the experience data in a sensing hardware. Along with this monograph are also associated four appendices, summarizing different elements related to the context of this research.

Title: Robustness of the flux-free sector of the Kitaev honeycomb against environment
Authors: Alexander Sattler, Maria Daghofer
Abstract: The Kitaev honeycomb model (KHM) consists of spin-$1/2$ particles on a honeycomb lattice with direction-dependent Ising-like interactions. It can alternatively be described in terms of non-interacting Majorana fermions, can be solved exactly, and has a quantum spin-liquid ground state. Open boundaries then host Majorana zero modes (MZMs) that are robust against some types of disorder. We analyze the fate of the MZMs when they couple to an environment via a Lindblad master equation. By computing the time evolution of the density matrix, we find that when decoherence occurs, the steady state is mostly the maximally mixed state. Among the few exceptions is a parameter regime that realizes the superconducting Kitaev chain model with periodic boundary conditions. We consistently observe a quantum Zeno effect in the density matrix as well as in the entropy and fidelity, while it is not found in the energy gap of some gapped spin liquids. We thus present a comprehensive overview over MZMs coupled to a spin bath that is relevant to proposals to detect MZMs of Kitaev layers on surfaces using scanning tunneling microscopy (STM).

Abstract: The occurrence of several crystal phases within nanostructures of a single material presents both challenges and opportunities. While unintended phase mixing can degrade optoelectronic performances, deliberate control of polytypism enables novel heterostructures with unique quantum properties, crystal phase quantum dots (CPQDs). However, since tailoring the formation of CPQDs is difficult, applications remain scarce. Here, we demonstrate electric-field-driven crystal phase switching in GaAs nanowires during vapor-liquid-solid growth, enabling precise control of crystal phases and creations of CPQDs with monolayer precision. Nanowires are epitaxially grown on custom-made silicon micro-substrates using chemical vapor deposition within an in-situ TEM. Real-time imaging reveals that the electric field switches instantaneously the crystal phase between zinc blende and wurtzite, creating atomically sharp interfaces. Numerical simulations are developed to investigate the impact of the electric field on the catalyst droplet geometry, which largely governs the crystal phase. This constitutes a key progress towards unlocking the potential of CPQDs.

Title: On the T-linear resistivity of cuprates: theory
Authors: Charu Dhiman, Raman Sharma, Navinder Singh
Abstract: By partitioning the electronic system of the optimally doped cuprates in two electronic components: (1) mobile electrons on oxygen sub-lattice; and (2) localized spins on copper sub-lattice, and considering the scattering of mobile electrons (on oxygen sub-lattice) via generation of paramagnons in the localized sub-system (copper spins), we ask what should be the electron-paramagnon coupling matrix element $M_q$ so that T-linear resistivity results. This 'reverse engineering approach' leads to $|M_q|^2 \sim \frac{1}{q^2+\xi(T)^{-2}}$. We comment how can such exotic coupling emerge in 2D systems where short range magnetic fluctuations resides. In other words, the role of quantum criticality is found to be crucial. And the T-linear behaviour of resistivity demands that the magnetic correlation length scales as $\xi(T)\propto\frac{1}{T}$, which seems to be a reasonable assumption in the quantum critical regime of cuprates (that is, near optimal doping where T-linear resistivity is observed).

Title: Real-space understanding of electron-phonon coupling in superconducting hydrides
Authors: Trinidad Novoa, Raffaello Bianco, Julia Contreras-García, Ion Errea
Abstract: Electron-phonon coupling is at the origin of conventional superconductivity, enabling the pairing of electrons into Cooper pairs. The electron-phonon matrix elements depend on the electronic eigenstates and, in the standard linear approximation, on the first derivative of the potential felt by the electrons with respect to ionic perturbations. Here, we focus on the derivatives of the potential with a twofold aim: to assess their contribution to the overall coupling and to analyze the limitations of neglecting higher-order derivatives. Several real-space functions are proposed to do the analysis, and are computed for some well-known superconductors. Our results show that, in hydrides, the derivatives of the potential tend to be larger in regions of high electron localization, explaining the success of electronic descriptors previously described to correlate with the critical temperature. The new functions introduced here are able to tell apart structures with similar types of bonding but very different critical temperatures, such as H3S and H3Se Im-3m phases, where electronic descriptors alone fail. Interestingly, our descriptors are capable of easily estimating the impact of higher-order terms in the electron-phonon coupling. In fact, we capture the limitations of the linear approximation expected for PdH, and predict an even more important non-linear behavior in LaH10.

Title: Force sensing with a graphene nanomechanical resonator coupled to photonic crystal guided resonances
Authors: Heng Lu, Tingting Li, Hui Hu, Fengnan Chen, Ti Sun, Ying Yan, Chinhua Wang, Joel Moser
Abstract: Achieving optimal force sensitivity with nanomechanical resonators requires the ability to resolve their thermal vibrations. In two-dimensional resonators, this can be done by measuring the energy they absorb while vibrating in an optical standing wave formed between a light source and a mirror. However, the responsivity of this method -- the change in optical energy per unit displacement of the resonator -- is modest, fundamentally limited by the physics of propagating plane waves. We present simulations showing that replacing the mirror with a photonic crystal supporting guided resonances increases the responsivity of graphene resonators by an order of magnitude. The steep optical energy gradients enable efficient transduction of flexural vibrations using low optical power, thereby reducing heating. Furthermore, the presence of two guided resonances at different wavelengths allows thermal vibrations to be resolved with a high signal-to-noise ratio across a wide range of membrane positions in free space. Our approach provides a simple optical method for implementing ultrasensitive force detection using a graphene nanomechanical resonator.

Title: Investigating the convergence properties of iterative ptychography for atomic-resolution low-dose imaging
Authors: Tamazouzt Chennit, Songge Li, Hoelen L. Lalandec Robert, Christoph Hofer, Nadine J. Schrenker, Liberato Manna, Sara Bals, Timothy J. Pennycook, Jo Verbeeck
Abstract: This study investigates the convergence properties of a collection of iterative electron ptychography methods, under low electron doses ($<$ 10$^3$ $e^-/A^2$) and gives particular attention to the impact of the user-defined update strengths. We demonstrate that carefully chosen values for this parameter, ideally smaller than those conventionally met in the literature, are essential for achieving accurate reconstructions of the projected electrostatic potential. Using a 4D dataset of a thin hybrid organic-inorganic formamidinium lead bromide (FAPbBr$_{3}$) sample, we show that convergence is in practice achievable only when the update strengths for both the object and probe are relatively small compared to what is found in literature. Additionally we demonstrate that under low electron doses, the reconstructions initial error increases when the update strength coefficients are reduced below a certain threshold emphasizing the existence of critical values beyond which the algorithms are trapped in local minima. These findings highlight the need for carefully optimized reconstruction parameters in iterative ptychography, especially when working with low electron doses, ensuring both effective convergence and correctness of the result.

Title: Quantum Kinetic Anatomy of Electron Angular Momenta Edge Accumulation
Authors: T. Valet, H. Jaffres, V. Cros, R. Raimondi
Abstract: Controlling electron's spin and orbital degrees of freedom has been a major research focus over the past two decades, as it underpins the electrical manipulation of magnetization. Leveraging a recently introduced quantum kinetic theory of multiband systems [T. Valet and R. Raimondi, Phys. Rev. B 111, L041118 (2025)], we outline how the intrinsic angular momenta linear response is partitioned into intraband and interband contributions. Focusing on time reversal and inversion symmetric metals, we show that the spin and orbital Hall currents are purely intraband. We also reveal that the edge densities originate partially, and in the orbital case mostly, from a new interband mechanism. We discuss how this profoundly impacts the interpretation of orbital edge accumulation observations, and has broader implications for our understanding of current induced torques.

Title: Fast Coherent Splitting of Bose-Einstein Condensates
Authors: Yevhenii Kuriatnikov, Nikolaus Würkner, Karthikeyan Kumaran, Tiantian Zhang, M. Venkat Ramana, Andreas Kugi, Jörg Schmiedmayer, Andreas Deutschmann-Olek, Maximilian Prüfer
Abstract: Preparation of non-trivial quantum states without introducing unwanted excitations or decoherence remains a central challenge in utilizing ultracold atomic systems for quantum simulation. We employ optimal control methods to realize fast, coherent splitting of a one-dimensional Bose-Einstein condensate, achieving minimal classical excitations while preserving quantum correlations. Furthermore, we explore two-step protocols in which controlled classical motion is first induced and subsequently suppressed via tailored control sequences. Our experiments highlight the potential of optimal control for quantum state engineering and dynamical control in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Soliton and traveling wave solutions in coupled one-dimensional condensates
Authors: Zeyu Rao, Xiaoshui Lin, Jingsong He, Guangcan Guo, Ming Gong
Abstract: Ultracold condensates provide a unique platform for exploring soliton physics. Motivated by the recent experiments realizing the sine-Gordon model in a split one-dimensional (1D) BEC, we demonstrate that this system naturally supports various density and phase solitons. We explore the physics using the bosonization technique, in which the phase and density are conjugate pairs, and determine its effective Language equation and the associated equation of motion. We show that in the presence of asymmetry between the two condensates, new solutions beyond those in the sine-Gordon model emerge. We calculate the traveling wave solutions and soliton solutions in this model and determine their corresponding energy densities analytically. Finally, we discuss the relevance of these solutions to the experiments and discuss their observations. This theory does not rely on the mechanism of quasi-particle excitation, which yields the Lee-Huang-Yang correction in higher dimensions, and is thus much more suitable to describe the physics in 1D systems. Since the physical models have already been realized in experiments, this work opens a new frontier for the realization of various soliton and periodic solutions using two coupled condensates.

Title: Thickness-Dependent Spin Pumping in YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ Bilayers
Authors: Marielle Hachem, Zeinab Harajli, Samih Isber, Mohammad Haidar
Abstract: We investigate the spin pumping efficiency in YIG/YIG/W$_{90}$Ti$_{10}$ bilayers by measuring the thickness dependence of both the YIG and WTi layers using broadband ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) spectroscopy. The deposition of a 5-nm WTi layer leads to enhanced Gilbert damping in thinner YIG films, indicating efficient spin current injection. From the spin pumping contribution to the damping of the YIG/WTi bilayer, we determine an effective spin mixing conductance of $ 3.3 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for the 5-nm WTi layer. Further measurements with varying WTi thickness reveal a non-monotonic dependence of spin mixing conductance, peaking at $ 4.2 \times 10^{18}~\mathrm{m}^{-2} $ for a 3-nm WTi layer. This behavior is attributed to a structural phase transition from the high-spin--orbit $ \beta $-phase to the less efficient $ \alpha $-phase in thicker WTi layers. Furthermore, comparative analysis with YIG/W bilayers shows that Ti doping significantly reduces $ g^{\uparrow\downarrow}_{\mathrm{eff}} $. These findings highlight the critical role of alloy composition and structural phase in tuning spin transport for spintronic applications.

Title: Robust Wannierization including magnetization and spin-orbit coupling via projectability disentanglement
Authors: Yuhao Jiang, Junfeng Qiao, Nataliya Paulish, Weisheng Zhao, Nicola Marzari, Giovanni Pizzi
Abstract: Maximally-localized Wannier functions (MLWFs) are widely employed as an essential tool for calculating the physical properties of materials due to their localized nature and computational efficiency. Projectability-disentangled Wannier functions (PDWFs) have recently emerged as a reliable and efficient approach for automatically constructing MLWFs that span both occupied and lowest unoccupied bands. Here, we extend the applicability of PDWFs to magnetic systems and/or those including spin-orbit coupling, and implement such extensions in automated workflows. Furthermore, we enhance the robustness and reliability of constructing PDWFs by defining an extended protocol that automatically expands the projectors manifold, when required, by introducing additional appropriate hydrogenic atomic orbitals. We benchmark our extended protocol on a set of 200 chemically diverse materials, as well as on the 40 systems with the largest band distance obtained with the standard PDWF approach, showing that on our test set the present approach delivers a 100% success rate in obtaining accurate Wannier-function interpolations, i.e., an average band distance below 15 meV between the DFT and Wannier-interpolated bands, up to 2 eV above the Fermi level.

Title: Discovery of High-Temperature Charge Order and Time-Reversal Symmetry-Breaking in the Kagome Superconductor YRu3Si2

Abstract: The identification of high-temperature unconventional charge order and superconductivity in kagome quantum materials is pivotal for deepening our understanding of geometrically frustrated and correlated electron systems, and for harnessing their exotic properties in future quantum technologies. Here, we report the discovery of a remarkably rich phase diagram in the kagome superconductor YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, uncovered through a unique combination of muon spin rotation (${\mu}$SR), magnetotransport, X-ray diffraction (XRD), and density functional theory (DFT) calculations. Our study reveals the emergence of a charge-ordered state with a propagation vector of (1/2, 0, 0), setting a record onset temperature of 800 K for such an order in a kagome system and for quantum materials more broadly. In addition, we observe time-reversal symmetry (TRS) breaking below $T_{2}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 25 K and field-induced magnetism below $T_{1}^{*}$ ${\simeq}$ 90 K, indicating the presence of a hidden magnetic state. These transitions are mirrored in the magnetoresistance data, which show a clear onset at ${\sim}$ $T_{1}^{*}$ and a pronounced increase below ${\sim}$ $T_{2}^{*}$, ultimately reaching a maximum magnetoresistance of 45${\%}$. Band structure calculations identify two van Hove singularities (VHSs) near the Fermi level, one of which resides within a flat band, suggesting a strong interplay between electronic correlations and emergent orders. At low temperatures, we find bulk superconductivity below $T_{\rm c}$ = 3.4 K, characterized by a pairing symmetry with either two isotropic full gaps or an anisotropic nodeless gap. Together, our findings point to a coexistence of high-temperature charge order, tunable magnetism, and multigap superconductivity in YRu$_{3}$Si$_{2}$, positioning it as a compelling platform for exploring correlated kagome physics.

Title: Self-induced Floquet states via three-wave processes in synthetic antiferromagnets
Authors: Thibaut Devolder, Joo-Von Kim
Abstract: We present a mechanism for self-induced Floquet states involving acoustic and optical modes in synthetic antiferromagnets. By driving optical modes off-resonantly with radiofrequency fields in the canted antiferromagnetic state, limit cycles arising from the predator-prey dynamics of the acoustic and optical mode populations can appear. The cyclic growth and decay of these mode populations induce a time-periodic modulation of the canted state, which subsequently generates Floquet states. These states appear as a rich frequency comb in the power spectrum of magnetization oscillations.

Title: Anisotropy-Driven Anomalous Inverse Orbital Hall Effect in Fe Films
Authors: E. Santos, U. Borges, J. L. Costa, J. B. S. Mendes, A. Azevedo
Abstract: This study investigates the anomalous orbital effects in iron (Fe) films with strong uniaxial anisotropy, highlighting the interactions between spin and orbital currents. Using heterogeneous YIG/Fe and YIG/Pt/Fe structures, fabricated by oblique deposition in a magnetic field, spin pumping ferromagnetic resonance (SP-FMR) measurements were performed. It was observed that the uniaxial anisotropy enables the emergence of spin-to-charge (AISHE) and orbital-to-charge (AIOHE) conversion signals in out-of-plane configurations, where the spin polarization is parallel to the direction of the spin current. Experimental analysis revealed that orbital dynamics, mediated by orbital Hall conductivity, are more prominent in Fe films due to the low spin-orbit interaction (SOC) and high orbital response. These findings provide fundamental insights for the advancement of orbitronics devices, indicating the potential for controlling orbital and spin currents through magnetic and anisotropic parameters.

Title: Excess quasiparticles and their dynamics in the presence of subgap states
Authors: P. B. Fischer, G. Catelani
Abstract: Material inhomogeneities in a superconductor generically lead to broadening of the density of states and to subgap states. The latter are associated with spatial fluctuations of the gap in which quasiparticles can be trapped. Recombination between such localized quasiparticles is hindered by their spatial separation and hence their density could be higher than expectations based on the recombination between mobile quasiparticles. We show here that the recombination between localized and mobile excitations can be efficient at limiting the quasiparticle density. We comment on the significance of our findings for devices such as superconducting resonators and qubits. We find that for typical aluminum devices, the subgap states do not significantly influence the quasiparticle density.

Title: Analytic toolkit for the Anderson model with arbitrary disorder
Authors: Oleg Evnin
Abstract: The Anderson model in one dimension is a quantum particle on a discrete chain of sites with nearest-neighbor hopping and random on-site potentials. It is a progenitor of many further models of disordered systems, and it has spurred numerous developments in diverse branches of physics. The literature is silent, however, on practical analytic tools for computing the density-of-states of this model when the distribution of the on-site potentials is arbitrary. Here, supersymmetry-based techniques are employed to give an explicit linear integral equation whose solutions control the density-of-states. The output of this analytic procedure is in perfect agreement with numerical sampling. By Thouless formula, these results immediately provide analytic control over the localization length.

Title: Denjoy's anachronistic topological viewpoint on Aubry transition
Authors: O. Cépas, G. Masbaum, P. Quémerais
Abstract: The Aubry transition is a phase transition between two types of incommensurate states, originally described as a transition by ``breaking of analyticity''. Here we present Denjoy's (anachronistic) viewpoint, who almost hundred years ago described certain mathematical properties of circle homeomorphisms with irrational rotation numbers. The connection between the two lies in the existence of a change of variables from the incommensurate ground state variables to new simple phase variables that rotate by a constant irrational angle. This confers a cyclic order, an essential property of models with the Aubry transition. Denjoy's description indicates that there are two types of cyclic order, distinguished by the regular or singular nature of the change of variables or, in mathematical terms, by the distinction between topological conjugacy versus semiconjugacy. This allows rephrasing the breaking of analyticity as a breaking of topological conjugacy. We illustrate this description with numerical calculations on the Frenkel-Kontorova model.

Title: Machine-Learned Force Fields for Lattice Dynamics at Coupled-Cluster Level Accuracy
Authors: Sita Schönbauer, Johanna P. Carbone, Andreas Grüneis
Abstract: We investigate Machine-Learned Force Fields (MLFFs) trained on approximate Density Functional Theory (DFT) and Coupled Cluster (CC) level potential energy surfaces for the carbon diamond and lithium hydride solids. We assess the accuracy and precision of the MLFFs by calculating phonon dispersions and vibrational densities of states (VDOS) that are compared to experiment and reference ab initio results. To overcome limitations from long-range effects and the lack of atomic forces in the CC training data, a delta-learning approach based on the difference between CC and DFT results is explored. Compared to DFT, MLFFs trained on CC theory yield higher vibrational frequencies for optical modes, agreeing better with experiment. Furthermore, the MLFFs are used to estimate anharmonic effects on the VDOS of lithium hydride at the level of CC theory.

Title: Photogalvanic effect in hydrodynamic flows of nonreciprocal electron liquids
Authors: E. Kirkinis, L. Bonds, A. Levchenko, A. V. Andreev
Abstract: We study nonlinear hydrodynamic electron transport driven by an AC electric field. In noncentrosymmetric conductors with broken time-reversal (TR) symmetry the nonlinear flow of such liquids is nonreciprocal, giving rise to a DC current $I^{DC}$ that is quadratic in the amplitude of the AC electric field. This is the hydrodynamic analogue of the linear photogalvanic effect (PGE), which arises in bulk noncentrosymmetric materials with broken TR symmetry. The magnitude of $I^{DC}$ depends on both the properties of the electron fluid and the geometry of the flow, and may be characterized by two dimensionless parameters: the nonreciprocity number $\mathcal{N}$, and the frequency-dependent vibrational number $\mathcal{R}$. Due to nonlocality of hydrodynamic transport, at low frequencies of the AC drive, $I^{DC}$ is super-extensive. The AC component of the electric current is likewise strongly affected by nonreciprocity: the hysteretic current-voltage dependence becomes skewed, which can be interpreted in terms of nonreciprocity of the memory retention time.

Abstract: Understanding structure at the atomic scale is fundamental for the development of materials with improved properties. Compared to other probes providing atomic resolution, electrons offer the strongest interaction in combination with minimal radiation damage. Here, we report the successful implementation of MeV electron diffraction for ab initio 3D structure determination at atomic resolution. Using ultrashort electron pulses from the REGAE accelerator, we obtained high-quality diffraction data from muscovite and $1T-TaS_2$, enabling structure refinements according to the dynamical scattering theory and the accurate determination of hydrogen atom positions. The increased penetration depth of MeV electrons allows for structure determination from samples significantly thicker than those typically applicable in electron diffraction. These findings establish MeV electron diffraction as a viable approach for investigating a broad range of materials, including nanostructures and radiation-sensitive compounds, and open up new opportunities for in-situ and time-resolved experiments.

Title: Reversible Modification of Rashba States in Topological Insulators at Room Temperature by Edge Functionalization
Authors: Wonhee Ko, Seoung-Hun Kang, Qiangsheng Lu, An-Hsi Chen, Gyula Eres, Ho Nyung Lee, Young-Kyun Kwon, Robert G. Moore, Mina Yoon, Matthew Brahlek
Abstract: Quantum materials with novel spin textures from strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) are essential components for a wide array of proposed spintronic devices. Topological insulators have necessary strong SOC that imposes a unique spin texture on topological states and Rashba states that arise on the boundary, but there is no established methodology to control the spin texture reversibly. Here, we demonstrate that functionalizing Bi2Se3 films by altering the step-edge termination directly changes the strength of SOC and thereby modifies the Rashba strength of 1D edge states. Scanning tunneling microscopy/spectroscopy shows that these Rashba edge states arise and subsequently vanish through the Se functionalization and reduction process of the step edges. The observations are corroborated by density functional theory calculations, which show that a subtle chemical change of edge termination fundamentally alters the underlying electronic structure. Importantly, we experimentally demonstrated fully reversible and repeatable switching of Rashba edge states across multiple cycles at room temperature. The results imply Se functionalization as a practical method to control SOC and spin texture of quantum states in topological insulators.

Title: Ultrafast and reliable domain-wall and skyrmion logic in a chirally coupled ferrimagnet

Abstract: Unlocking the spin degree of freedom in addition to the electron's charge, spin-based logic offers an in-memory computing architecture beyond-CMOS technology. Here, we encode information into chiral spin textures (e.g., chiral domain-wall and skyrmion) and achieve an ultrafast and reliable all-electrical logic by exploiting the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction-induced chiral coupling. Taking advantage of fast spin dynamics in antiferromagnetically coupled systems, we achieved a fast domain-wall motion passing through the logic gate, exceeding 1 kilometre per second, yielding an operation time of 50 picoseconds for a 50 nanometres-long logic gate. Furthermore, we present a fast logic operation with skyrmion bubbles in a racetrack that exhibits a topologically protected computation scheme. Our work demonstrates a viable approach for advanced microchips with high operation frequency and ultralow power consumption, paving the way for next-generation computing technologies.

Title: Compressibility of Confined Fluids from Volume Fluctuations
Authors: Jason Ogbebor, Santiago A. Flores Roman, Geordy Jomon, Gennady Y. Gor
Abstract: When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their properties deviate from bulk. These include bulk modulus, or compressibility, which determines the mechanical properties of fluid-saturated porous solids. Such properties are of importance for exploration and recovery of coal-bed methane and shale gas. We developed a new molecular simulation method for calculating compressibility of confined fluids, and applied it to methane in carbon nanopores. The method is based on volume fluctuations in the isothermal-isobaric ensemble, made possible through integrated potentials. Our method is one order of magnitude faster than the Monte Carlo approach, and allows calculations for pore sizes up to 100 nm. Our simulations predicted an increase in the fluid bulk modulus by a factor of 4 in 3 nm slit pores, and showed a gradual decrease with the increase of the pore size, so that at 100 nm, the deviation from the bulk is less than 5%.

Title: Emergent Multiferroic Altermagnets and Spin Control via Noncollinear Molecular Polarization
Authors: Ziye Zhu, Yuntian Liu, Xunkai Duan, Jiayong Zhang, Bowen Hao, Su-Huai Wei, Igor Zutic, Tong Zhou
Abstract: Altermagnets, with spin splitting and vanishing magnetization, have been attributed to many fascinating phenomena and potential applications. In particular, integrating ferroelectricity with altermagnetism to enable magnetoelectric coupling and electric control of spin has drawn significant attention. However, its experimental realization and precise spin manipulation remain elusive. Here, by focusing on molecular ferroelectrics, the first discovered ferroelectrics renowned for their highly controllable molecular polarizations and structural flexibility, we reveal that these obstacles can be removed by an emergent multiferroic altermagnets with tunable spin polarization in a large class of fabricated organic materials. Using a symmetry-based design and a tight-binding model, we uncover the underlying mechanism of such molecular ferroelectric altermagnets and demonstrate how noncollinear molecular polarization can switch the spin polarization on and off and even reverse its sign. From the first-principles calculations, we verify the feasibility of these materials in a series of well-established hybrid organic-inorganic perovskites and metal-organic frameworks. Our findings bridge molecular ferroelectrics and altermagnetic spintronics, highlighting an unexplored potential of multifunctional organic multiferroics.

Title: Exciton transport driven by spin excitations in an antiferromagnet
Authors: Florian Dirnberger, Sophia Terres, Zakhar A. Iakovlev, Kseniia Mosina, Zdenek Sofer, Akashdeep Kamra, Mikhail M. Glazov, Alexey Chernikov
Abstract: A new class of optical quasiparticles called magnetic excitons recently emerged in magnetic van der Waals materials. Akin to the highly effective strategies developed for electrons, the strong interactions of these excitons with the spin degree of freedom may provide innovative solutions for long-standing challenges in optics, such as steering the flow of energy and information. Here, we demonstrate transport of excitons by spin excitations in the van der Waals antiferromagnetic semiconductor CrSBr. Key results of our study are the observations of ultrafast, nearly isotropic exciton propagation substantially enhanced at the Neel temperature, transient contraction and expansion of the exciton clouds at low temperatures, as well as superdiffusive behavior in bilayer samples. These signatures largely defy description by commonly known exciton transport mechanisms and are related to the currents of incoherent magnons induced by laser excitation instead. We propose that the drag forces exerted by these currents can effectively imprint characteristic properties of spin excitations onto the motion of excitons. The universal nature of the underlying exciton-magnon scattering promises driving of excitons by magnons in other magnetic semiconductors and even in non-magnetic materials by proximity in heterostructures, merging the rich physics of magneto-transport with optics and photonics.

Title: Bootstrapping the Simplest Deconfined Quantum Critical Point
Authors: Shai M. Chester, Alessandro Piazza, Marten Reehorst, Ning Su
Abstract: We study the $N=3$ case of the $CP^{N-1}$ model, which is a field theory of $N$ complex scalars in $3d$ coupled to an Abelian gauge field with $SU(N) \times U(1)$ global symmetry. Recent evidence suggests the $N=2$ theory is not critical, which makes the $N=3$ theory the simplest possibility of deconfined quantum criticality. We apply the conformal bootstrap to correlators of charge $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators under the $U(1)$ symmetry, which gives us access also to $q=3,4$ operators. After imposing that only the lowest $q=0,1,2$ scalar operators are relevant, we find that the bootstrap bounds are saturated by the large $N$ prediction for $q=1,2,3,4$ scalar monopole operator scaling dimensions, which were shown earlier to be accurate even for small $N$, as well as a lattice prediction for the $q=0$ non-monopole scalar operator. We also predict the scaling dimensions of the lowest spinning monopole operators, which we match to the large charge prediction for spinning operators. This suggests that the critical $CP^{2}$ model is described by this bootstrap bound.

Title: Krylov Complexity
Authors: Eliezer Rabinovici, Adrián Sánchez-Garrido, Ruth Shir, Julian Sonner
Abstract: We introduce and review a new complexity measure, called `Krylov complexity', which takes its origins in the field of quantum-chaotic dynamics, serving as a canonical measure of operator growth and spreading. Krylov complexity, underpinned by the Lanczos algorithm, has since evolved into a highly diverse field of its own right, both because of its attractive features as a complexity, whose definition does not depend on arbitrary control parameters, and whose phenomenology serves as a rich and sensitive probe of chaotic dynamics up to exponentially late times, but also because of its relevance to seemingly far-afield subjects such as holographic dualities and the quantum physics of black holes. In this review we give a unified perspective on these topics, emphasizing the robust and most general features of K-complexity, both in chaotic and integrable systems, state and prove theorems on its generic features and describe how it is geometrised in the context of (dual) gravitational dynamics. We hope that this review will serve both as a source of intuition about K-complexity in and of itself, as well as a resource for researchers trying to gain an overview over what is by now a rather large and multi-faceted literature. We also mention and discuss a number of open problems related to K-complexity, underlining its currently very active status as a field of research.

Title: Mutual Influence of Symmetries and Topological Field Theories
Authors: Daniel Teixeira, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We study how the fusion 2-category symmetry of a fermionic (2+1)d QFT can be affected when one allows for stacking with TQFTs to be an equivalence relation for QFTs. Focusing on a simple kind of fermionic fusion 2-category described purely by group theoretical data, our results reveal that by allowing for stacking with $\mathrm{Spin}(n)_1$ as an equivalence relation enables a finite set of inequivalent modifications to the original fusion 2-categorical-symmetry. To put our results in a broader context, we relate the order of the symmetry modifications to the image of a map between groups of minimal nondegenerate extensions, and to the tangential structure set by the initial categorical symmetry on the background manifold for the QFT.

Abstract: Waveguide quantum electrodynamics (QED) provides a powerful framework for engineering quantum interactions, traditionally relying on periodic photonic arrays with continuous energy bands. Here, we investigate waveguide QED in a fundamentally different environment: A one-dimensional photonic array whose hopping strengths are structured aperiodically according to the deterministic Fibonacci-Lucas substitution rule. These "Fibonacci waveguides" lack translational invariance and are characterized by a singular continuous energy spectrum and critical eigenstates, representing a deterministic intermediate between ordered and disordered systems. We demonstrate how to achieve decoherence-free, coherent interactions in this unique setting. We analyze two paradigmatic cases: (i) Giant emitters resonantly coupled to the simplest aperiodic version of a standard waveguide. For these, we show that atom photon bound states form only for specific coupling configurations dictated by the aperiodic sequence, leading to an effective atomic Hamiltonian, which itself inherits the Fibonacci structure; and (ii) emitters locally and off-resonantly coupled to the aperiodic version of the Su-Schrieffer-Heeger waveguide. In this case the mediating bound states feature aperiodically modulated profiles, resulting in an effective Hamiltonian with multifractal properties. Our work establishes Fibonacci waveguides as a versatile platform, which is experimentally feasible, demonstrating that the deterministic complexity of aperiodic structures can be directly engineered into the interactions between quantum emitters.

Title: Quantum sensing with ultracold simulators in lattice and ensemble systems: a review
Authors: Keshav Das Agarwal, Sayan Mondal, Ayan Sahoo, Debraj Rakshit, Aditi Sen De, Ujjwal Sen
Abstract: Sensing of parameters is an important aspect in all disciplines, with applications ranging from fundamental science to medicine. Quantum sensing and metrology is an emerging field that lies at the cross-roads of quantum physics, quantum technology, and the discipline in which the parameter estimation is to be performed. While miniaturization of devices often requires quantum mechanics to be utilized for understanding and planning of a parameter estimation, quantum-enhanced sensing is also possible that uses paradigmatic quantum characteristics like quantum coherence and quantum entanglement to go beyond the so-called standard quantum limit. The current review hopes to bring together the concepts related to quantum sensing as realized in ensemble systems, like spin ensembles, light-matter systems, and Bose-Einstein condensates, and lattice systems, like those which can be modelled by the Bose- and Fermi-Hubbard models, and quantum spin models.

Title: Balanced multi-species spin glasses
Authors: Erik Bates, Youngtak Sohn
Abstract: We identify a special class of multi-species spin glass models: ones in which the species proportions serve to ``balance'' out the interaction strengths. For this class, we prove a free energy lower bound that does not require any convexity assumption, and applies to both Ising and spherical models. The lower bound is the free energy of a single-species model whose $p$-spin inverse-temperature parameter is exactly the variance of the $p$-spin component of the multi-species Hamiltonian. We further demonstrate that this lower bound is actually an equality in many cases, including: at high temperatures for all models, at all temperatures for convex models, and at zero temperature for pure bipartite spherical models. When translated to a statement about the injective norm of a nonsymmetric Gaussian tensor, our lower bound matches an upper bound recently established by Dartois and McKenna.

Title: Optimisation of Electrolyser Operation: Integrating External Heat
Authors: Matthias Derez, Alexander Hoogsteyn, Erik Delarue
Abstract: Integrating external heat into electrolysers can reduce the electrical power demand for carbon-neutral hydrogen production. Efficient operation requires detailed models that incorporate heat availability and its effect on startup costs. This paper advances existing operational models by endogenously modelling startup costs and direct heat integration, based on a piecewise linear approximation of the electrochemical equations. We analyse the impact of low- and high-temperature heat integration on the efficiency and profitability of hydrogen production for solid oxide and proton exchange membrane electrolysis technologies.

Title: Does an intermittent dynamical system remain (weakly) chaotic after drilling in a hole?
Authors: Samuel Brevitt, Rainer Klages
Abstract: Chaotic dynamical systems are often characterised by a positive Lyapunov exponent, which signifies an exponential rate of separation of nearby trajectories. However, in a wide range of so-called weakly chaotic systems, the separation of nearby trajectories is sub-exponential in time, and the Lyapunov exponent vanishes. When a hole is introduced in chaotic systems, the positive Lyapunov exponents on the system's fractal repeller can be related to the generation of metric entropy and the escape rate from the system. The escape rate, in turn, cross-links these two chaos properties to important statistical-physical quantities like the diffusion coefficient. However, no suitable generalisation of this escape rate formalism exists for weakly chaotic systems. In our paper we show that in a paradigmatic one-dimensional weakly chaotic iterated map, the Pomeau-Manneville map, a generalisation of its Lyapunov exponent (which we call `stretching') is completely suppressed in the presence of a hole. This result is based on numerical evidence and a corresponding stochastic model. The correspondence between map and model is tested via a related partially absorbing map. We examine the structure of the map's fractal repeller, which we reconstruct via a simple algorithm. Our findings are in line with rigorous mathematical results concerning the collapse of the system's density as it evolves in time. We also examine the generation of entropy in the open map, which is shown to be consistent with the collapsed stretching. As a result, we conclude that no suitable generalisation of the escape rate formalism to weakly chaotic systems can exist.

Title: Solving boundary time crystals via the superspin method
Authors: Dominik Nemeth, Alessandro Principi, Ahsan Nazir
Abstract: Boundary time crystals have been extensively studied through numerical and mean-field methods. However, a comprehensive analytical approach in terms of the Liouvillian eigenvalues, without semiclassical approximations, has yet to be developed. In this work, we analyse the Liouvillian spectrum of dissipative spin models, within a perturbative framework in the weak-dissipation limit. Introducing the superspin method, we compute the eigenvalues to first order in perturbation theory, providing a direct and transparent explanation for the emergence of the time crystal phase. We analytically demonstrate how spontaneous symmetry breaking occurs, leading to persistent oscillations. Our method can be used as a tool to unequivocally identify new dissipative collective spin models that support a boundary time crystal phase. We demonstrate this by applying the technique to four distinct, collective spin Liouvillians, which experience some dissipation. The first of these is the paradigmatic model studied in [1]. We demonstrate how the boundary time crystal phase is a general feature of models that yield a solution solely in terms of a quantity that we term the superspin. Furthermore, we analyse the stability of this phase and demonstrate how, in some cases, it is stable against increasing dissipation.

Title: L-based numerical linked cluster expansion for square lattice models
Authors: Mahmoud Abdelshafy, Marcos Rigol
Abstract: We introduce a numerical linked cluster expansion for square-lattice models whose building block is an L-shape cluster. For the spin-1/2 models studied in this work, we find that this expansion exhibits a similar or better convergence of the bare sums than that of the (larger) square-shaped clusters, and can be used with resummation techniques (like the site- and bond-based expansions) to obtain results at even lower temperatures. We compare the performance of weak- and strong-embedding versions of this expansion in various spin-1/2 models, and show that the strong-embedding version is preferable because of its convergence properties and lower computational cost. Finally, we show that the expansion based on the L-shape cluster can be naturally used to study properties of lattice models that smoothly connect the square and triangular lattice geometries.

Title: Unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in plasmonic photocatalysis
Authors: Yu Chen, Shengxiang Wu, Shiwu Gao
Abstract: The damping of surface plasmons generates hot carriers, which holds promise for photoelectric conversion and photocatalysis. Recent studies have revealed the nonequilibrium characters of the plasmonic hot carriers and their nonadiabatic coupling to molecular vibrations. Yet, the precise mechanism of plasmonic photocatalysis remains elusive and controversial. Here, we present a unified description of thermal and nonthermal hot carriers in the dynamics of vibrational excitation and photodissocation, where a quantitative comparison between the two mechanisms can be made. We revisit a well-studied system, O$_2$ dissociation on silver nanoparticles. The nonthermal hot carriers are found to promote molecular dissociation in the low-temperature or high-intensity regime. With increasing laser intensity, the dissociation rate exhibits a transition from a linear to nonlinear dependence due to the onset of vibrational heating as observed in experiment. Our model provides a unified framework to understand the mechanism and dynamics of photocatalysis and reveals the nonthermal pathways for energy harvesting and conversion with surface plasmons.

Title: Mass-Assisted Local Deconfinement in a Confined $\mathbb{Z}_2$ Lattice Gauge Theory
Authors: Jean-Yves Desaules, Thomas Iadecola, Jad C. Halimeh
Abstract: Confinement is a prominent phenomenon in condensed matter and high-energy physics that has recently become the focus of quantum-simulation experiments of lattice gauge theories (LGTs). As such, a theoretical understanding of the effect of confinement on LGT dynamics is not only of fundamental importance, but can lend itself to upcoming experiments. Here, we show how confinement in a $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGT can be locally avoided by proximity to a resonance between the fermion mass and the electric field strength. Furthermore, we show that this local deconfinement can become global for certain initial conditions, where information transport occurs over the entire chain. In addition, we show how this can lead to strong quantum many-body scarring starting in different initial states. Our findings provide deeper insights into the nature of confinement in $\mathbb{Z}_2$ LGTs and can be tested on current and near-term quantum devices.

Title: Less can be more for predicting properties with large language models
Authors: Nawaf Alampara, Santiago Miret, Kevin Maik Jablonka
Abstract: Predicting properties from coordinate-category data -- sets of vectors paired with categorical information -- is fundamental to computational science. In materials science, this challenge manifests as predicting properties like formation energies or elastic moduli from crystal structures comprising atomic positions (vectors) and element types (categorical information). While large language models (LLMs) have increasingly been applied to such tasks, with researchers encoding structural data as text, optimal strategies for achieving reliable predictions remain elusive. Here, we report fundamental limitations in LLM's ability to learn from coordinate information in coordinate-category data. Through systematic experiments using synthetic datasets with tunable coordinate and category contributions, combined with a comprehensive benchmarking framework (MatText) spanning multiple representations and model scales, we find that LLMs consistently fail to capture coordinate information while excelling at category patterns. This geometric blindness persists regardless of model size (up to 70B parameters), dataset scale (up to 2M structures), or text representation strategy. Our findings suggest immediate practical implications: for materials property prediction tasks dominated by structural effects, specialized geometric architectures consistently outperform LLMs by significant margins, as evidenced by a clear "GNN-LM wall" in performance benchmarks. Based on our analysis, we provide concrete guidelines for architecture selection in scientific machine learning, while highlighting the critical importance of understanding model inductive biases when tackling scientific prediction problems.

Title: Random matrix universality in dynamical correlation functions at late times
Authors: Oscar Bouverot-Dupuis, Silvia Pappalardi, Jorge Kurchan, Anatoli Polkovnikov, Laura Foini
Abstract: We study the behavior of two-time correlation functions at late times for finite system sizes considering observables whose (one-point) average value does not depend on energy. In the long time limit, we show that such correlation functions display a ramp and a plateau determined by the correlations of energy levels, similar to what is already known for the spectral form factor. The plateau value is determined, in absence of degenerate energy levels, by the fluctuations of diagonal matrix elements, which highlights differences between different symmetry classes. We show this behavior analytically by employing results from Random Matrix Theory and the Eigenstate Thermalisation Hypothesis, and numerically by exact diagonalization in the toy example of a Hamiltonian drawn from a Random Matrix ensemble and in a more realistic example of disordered spin glasses at high temperature. Importantly, correlation functions in the ramp regime do not show self-averaging behaviour, and, at difference with the spectral form factor the time average does not coincide with the ensemble average.

Title: Optimal closed-loop control of active particles and a minimal information engine
Authors: Rosalba Garcia-Millan, Janik Schüttler, Michael E. Cates, Sarah A. M. Loos
Abstract: We study the elementary problem of moving an active particle by a trap with minimum work input. We show analytically that (open-loop) optimal protocols are not affected by activity, but work fluctuations are always increased. For closed-loop protocols, which rely on initial measurements of the self-propulsion, the average work has a minimum for a finite persistence time. Using these insights, we derive an optimal periodic active information engine, which is found to have higher precision and information efficiency when operated with a run-and-tumble particle than for an active Ornstein-Uhlenbeck particle and, we argue, than for any other type of active particle.

Title: On the difference between thermalization in open and isolated quantum systems: a case study
Authors: Archak Purkayastha, Giacomo Guarnieri, Janet Anders, Marco Merkli
Abstract: Thermalization of isolated and open quantum systems has been studied extensively. However, being the subject of investigation by different scientific communities and being analysed using different mathematical tools, the connection between the isolated (IQS) and open (OQS) approaches to thermalization has remained opaque. Here we demonstrate that the fundamental difference between the two paradigms is the order in which the long time and the thermodynamic limits are taken. This difference implies that they describe physics on widely different time and length scales. Our analysis is carried out numerically for the case of a double quantum dot (DQD) coupled to a fermionic lead. We show how both OQS and IQS thermalization can be explored in this model on equal footing, allowing a fair comparison between the two. We find that while the quadratically coupled (free) DQD experiences no isolated thermalization, it of course does experience open thermalization. For the non-linearly interacting DQD coupled to a fermionic lead, the many-body interaction in the DQD breaks the integrability of the whole system. We find that this system shows strong evidence of both OQS and IQS thermalization in the same dynamics, but at widely different time scales, consistent with reversing the order of the long time and the thermodynamic limits.

Title: Two-color laser control of photocurrent and high harmonics in graphene
Authors: Minoru Kanega, Masahiro Sato
Abstract: We comprehensively investigate two-color-laser-driven photocurrent and high harmonic generation (HHG) in graphene models. By numerically solving the quantum master equation, we uniformly explore a broad parameter regime including both the weak (perturbative) and intense-laser (nonperturbative) cases while considering the dissipation effects. We demonstrate that the HHG spectra can be drastically altered by tuning the real-space path traced by the laser electric field. This controllability is explained by the dynamical symmetry argument. We also show that both the magnitude and the direction of photocurrent (zeroth order harmonics) can be controlled by varying the frequency, intensity, ellipticity, and relative phase of the two-color laser. Furthermore, the nature of photocurrent is shown to be classified into shift- or injection-current types, depending on the phase of two-color laser. Our findings indicate that even in centrosymmetric electron systems, photocurrent and HHG can be quantitatively controlled by adjusting various external parameters if we utilize multicolor laser with a lower spatial or temporal symmetry.

Title: Field theory for monitored Brownian SYK clusters
Authors: Anastasiia Tiutiakina, Hugo Lóio, Guido Giachetti, Jacopo De Nardis, Andrea De Luca
Abstract: We consider the time evolution of multiple clusters of Brownian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK), i.e. systems of N Majorana fermions with a noisy interaction term. In addition to the unitary evolution, we introduce two-fermion monitorings. We construct a coherent states path integral of the dynamics by generalizing spin coherent states for higher symmetry groups. We then demonstrate that the evolution of the replicated density matrix can be described by an effective field theory for the "light" degrees of freedom, i.e. the quantum fluctuations generated by the unitary evolution. This method is applied to both quadratic, where the field theory reduces to the nonlinear sigma model (NLSM), and also to interacting SYK clusters. We show that in the stationary regime, two monitored clusters exhibit linear-in-N entanglement, with a proportionality factor dependent on the strength of the unitary coupling.

Title: Work-function and structures of (100), (111) and (101) Au surfaces with/without oxygen
Authors: Yukio Watanabe (1,2), S. Miyauchi (1), S. Kaku (1), T. Yamada (1), A. Horiguchi (1),  ((1) Kyushu University, Fukuoka, Japan, (2) University of Hyogo, Himeji, Japan)
Abstract: The Work function (f)is fundamental for chemistry and electronics. Additionally, f can be used to examine the validity of the theoretical surfaces by comparing it with experimental f, even in the absence of long-range orders. In the reported and present experiments, the difference in f between pristine and oxygen-covered Au surfaces (df) is <1 eV at =<1 ML (1 ML: one full-monolayer). Contrarily, the available density functional theory (DFT) reports df ~ 3 eV for Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML. Hence, we study structures of O-atom-covered Au(100), Au(110), and Au(111) surfaces using DFT. The calculated most stable structures show df <1.1 eV at =<1 ML and a nearly constant df at > 1 ML, which match experiments and are confirmed using hybrid functional. These agreements result from the stability-criteria transition between low and high O-coverages, driven by the O-induced displacements of Au-atoms and the new surface structures at high O-coverages. The most stable structures exhibit molecule-like O arrangements at Au(111) surfaces at 1 ML and all surfaces at 2 ML; the former is considered chemisorption. At Au(111) surfaces, some structures containing O-atoms in subsurfaces have formation energies that approach those of the most stable structures, while the variation of these structures increases with surface size. Hence, mixing these structures with the most stable structures is believed to destroy long-range orders, which agrees with the experiments. The density of states at the surfaces calculated using the hybrid functional exhibit small bandgaps at the Au(100) and Au(110) surfaces at 1 ML.

Title: Subwavelength Localisation in Disordered Systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We elucidate the different mechanisms of wave localisation in disordered finite systems of subwavelength resonators, where the disorder is in the spatial arrangement of the resonators. To do so, we employ the capacitance matrix formalism and develop a variety of tools to understand localisation in this setting. Namely, we adapt the Thouless criterion of localisation to quantify the various mechanisms of localisation. We also employ a propagation matrix approach to prove a Saxon-Hutner type theorem ensuring the existence of band gaps for disordered systems and to predict the corresponding Lyapunov exponents. We further investigate the stabilities of bandgaps and localised eigenmodes with respect to fluctuations in the system by introducing a method of defect mode prediction based on the discrete Green function and illuminating the phenomena of Anderson localisation and level repulsion under global disorder.

Title: Scattering theory of higher order topological phases
Authors: R. Johanna Zijderveld, Isidora Araya Day, Anton R. Akhmerov
Abstract: The surface states of intrinsic higher order topological phases are protected by the spatial symmetries of a finite sample. This property makes the existing scattering theory of topological invariants inapplicable because the scattering geometry is either incompatible with the symmetry or does not probe the bulk topology. We resolve this obstacle by using a symmetric scattering geometry that probes transport from the inside to the outside of the sample. We demonstrate that the intrinsic higher order topology is captured by the flux dependence of the reflection matrix. Our finding follows from identifying the spectral flow of a flux line as a signature of higher order topology. We show how this scattering approach applies to several examples of higher order topological insulators and superconductors. Our theory provides an alternative approach for proving bulk--edge correspondence in intrinsic higher order topological phases, especially in presence of disorder.

Title: Atomic resolution imaging of the strength and 3D direction of atomic displacements in functional oxide thin films
Authors: Ian MacLaren, Aurys Silinga, Juri Barthel, Josee Kleibeuker, Judith L MacManus-Driscoll, Christopher S Allen, Angus I Kirkland
Abstract: Atomic resolution imaging is key to understanding thin film growth and how a particular set of conditions influences properties. Whilst such imaging in the scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) has had transformative impact in nanoscience, it forms projection images and provides no direct information about displacements perpendicular to the image plane. In this article we show that it is possible to make atomic resolution maps of the direction and magnitude of La displacements at ~30° to the imaging plane in a La2CoMnO6 thin film on (111) LSAT (LaAlO3-La(Sr,Ta)O3) using a 4-dimensional STEM (4DSTEM) methodology. This reveals that the La modulation lies preferentially in the interface plane, and is strongly suppressed close to the epitaxial interface, and further reveals how the modulation varies with distance from the interface with unit cell resolution. These details would be completely invisible to all prior techniques in electron microscopy and this sheds light on why this particular substrate in this orientation best promotes double perovskite cation ordering, and the consequent optimal magnetic ordering for this thin film system. The approach used herein of fitting atomic resolution 4DSTEM data to determine crystal parameters opens the door for a new era of atomic-resolution crystallography.

Title: Nonlinear Response Identities and Bounds for Nonequilibrium Steady States
Authors: Ruicheng Bao, Shiling Liang
Abstract: Understanding how systems respond to external perturbations is fundamental to statistical physics. For systems far from equilibrium, a general framework for response remains elusive. While progress has been made on the linear response of nonequilibrium systems, a theory for the nonlinear regime under finite perturbations has been lacking. Here, building on a novel connection between response and mean first-passage times in continuous-time Markov chains, we derive a comprehensive theory for the nonlinear response to archetypal local perturbations. We establish an exact identity that universally connects the nonlinear response of any observable to its linear counterpart via a simple scaling factor. This identity directly yields universal bounds on the response magnitude. Furthermore, we establish a universal bound on response resolution -- an inequality constraining an observable's change by its intrinsic fluctuations -- thereby setting a fundamental limit on signal-to-noise ratio. These results provide a rigorous and general framework for analyzing nonlinear response far from equilibrium, which we illustrate with an application to transcriptional regulation.

Title: Operating semiconductor qubits without individual barrier gates

Abstract: Semiconductor spin qubits have emerged as a promising platform for quantum computing, following a significant improvement in their control fidelities over recent years. Increasing the qubit count remains challenging, beginning with the fabrication of small features and complex fanouts. A particular challenge has been formed by the need for individual barrier gates to control the exchange interaction between adjacent spin qubits. Here, we propose a method to vary two-qubit interactions without applying pulses on individual barrier gates while also remaining insensitive to detuning noise in first order. Experimentally we find that changing plunger gate voltages over 300 mV can tune the exchange energy $J$ from 100 kHz to 60 MHz. This allows us to perform two-qubit operations without changing the barrier gate voltage. Based on these findings we conceptualize a spin qubit architecture without individual barrier gates, simplifying the fabrication while maintaining the control necessary for universal quantum computation.

Title: Optical absorption and luminescence of $α$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation
Authors: Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe-Salpeter Equation (BSE). The half-filling of the narrow split-off band leads to a spin-splitting and formation of magnetic moments of 0.5 $\mu_B$ per V which order antiferromagnetically along the chain or $b$-direction. The imaginary part of the dielectric function shows a very strong optical absorption band near 2 eV for polarization along the $a$-direction. This absorptions stems from a localized transition between the occupied V-$d_{xy}$ derived band, which is odd with respect to the $a$-mirrorplane to the higher lying empty band formed from the same V-$d_{xy}$ orbitals but even with respect to that mirror-plane, which explains its polarization and large oscillator strength. We relate this to a recent experimental study of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a suppression of the lowest CL peak was observed upon addition of Li. The lowest CL peak near 1.8 eV, which lies well below the indirect absorption onset of V$_2$O$_5$ is proposed to be related to recombination of a self-trapped electron polaron, resulting from oxygen vacancies, with a hole at the valence band maximum and is suppressed in LiV$_2$O$_5$ by the strong self--absorption from the Li induced occupied band to the higher empty bands at about the same energy.

Title: Efficient First-Principles Framework for Overdamped Phonon Dynamics and Anharmonic Electron-Phonon Coupling in Superionic Materials
Authors: Yuxuan Wang, Marios Zacharias, Xiao Zhang, Nick Pant, Jacky Even, Pierre F. P. Poudeu, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Relying on the anharmonic special displacement method, we introduce an ab initio quasistatic polymorphous framework to describe local disorder, anharmonicity, and electron-phonon coupling in superionic conductors. Using the example of cubic Cu2Se, we show that positional polymorphism yields extremely overdamped anharmonic vibrations while preserving transverse acoustic phonons, consistent with experiments. We also demonstrate well-defined electronic band structures with large band gap openings due to polymorphism of 1.0 eV and calculate anharmonic electron-phonon renormalization, yielding band gap narrowing with increasing temperature in agreement with previous measurements. Our approach opens the way for efficient ab initio electronic structure calculations in superionic crystals to elucidate their compelling high figure-of-merit.

Title: Interpretable and Equation-Free Response Theory for Complex Systems
Authors: Valerio Lucarini
Abstract: Response theory provides a pathway for understanding the sensitivity of a system and for predicting how its statistical properties change when a perturbation is applied. In the case of complex and multiscale systems, to achieve enhanced practical applicability, response theory should be interpretable, capable of focusing on relevant timescales, and amenable to data-driven and equation-agnostic implementations. Along these lines, in the spirit of Markov state modelling, we present linear and nonlinear response formulas for Markov chains. We obtain simple and easily implementable expressions that can be used to predict the response of observables as well as of higher-order correlations. The methodology proposed here can be implemented in a purely data-driven setting and even if the underlying evolution equations are unknown. The use of algebraic expansions inspired by Koopmanism allows to elucidate the role of different time scales and modes of variability, and to find explicit and interpretable expressions for the Green's functions at all orders. This is a major advantage of the framework proposed here. We illustrate our methodology in a very simple yet instructive metastable system. Finally, our results provide a dynamical foundation for the Prony method, which is commonly used for the statistical analysis of discrete time signals.

Title: Fractionalized Prethermalization in the One-Dimensional Hubbard Model
Authors: Anton Romen, Johannes Knolle, Michael Knap
Abstract: Prethermalization phenomena in driven systems are generally understood via a local Floquet Hamiltonian obtained from a high-frequency expansion. Remarkably, recently it has been shown that a driven Kitaev spin liquid with fractionalized excitations can realize a quasi-stationary state that is not captured by this paradigm. Instead distinct types of fractionalized excitations are characterized by vastly different temperatures-a phenomenon dubbed "fractionalized prethermalization". In our work, we analyze fractionalized prethermalization in a driven one-dimensional Hubbard model at strong coupling which hosts spin-charge fractionalization. At intermediate frequencies quasi-steady states emerge which are characterized by a low spin and high charge temperature with lifetimes set by two competing processes: the lifetime of the quasiparticles determined by Fermi's Golden rule and the exponential lifetime of the Floquet prethermal plateau. We classify drives into three categories, each giving rise to distinct (fractional) prethermalization dynamics. Resorting to a time-dependent variant of the Schrieffer-Wolff transformation, we systematically analyze how these drive categories are linked to the underlying driven Hubbard model, thereby providing a general understanding of the emergent thermalization dynamics. We discuss routes towards an experimental realization of this phenomenon in quantum simulation platforms.

Title: Nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling in (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ films

Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity in Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) bilayer nickelate films under ambient pressure provides an unprecedented opportunity to directly investigate electronic energy scales of the superconducting state and the pairing mechanism. Here, we report angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy measurements of superconducting (La,Pr,Sm)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films epitaxially grown on SrLaAlO$_4$ substrates by developing an ultra-high vacuum low-temperature quenching and transfer technique. A finite superconducting gap of ~18 meV with pronounced coherence peak is observed along the Brillouin zone diagonal direction. Remarkably, the finite superconducting gap persists across the entire Brillouin zone of the underlying Fermi surfaces, revealing the absence of gap nodes. An abrupt band renormalization, manifested as a kink in the energy-momentum dispersion at ~70 meV below the Fermi level, indicates an electron-boson coupling in the system. The simultaneous observation of a nodeless superconducting gap and electron-boson coupling provides crucial insights into the pairing symmetry and gluing mechanism in high-T$_c$ RP bilayer nickelates.

Title: Nematic order from phase synchronization of shape oscillations
Authors: Ioannis Hadjifrangiskou, Sumesh P. Thampi, Rahil N. Valani
Abstract: We show that a suspension of non-interacting deformable particles subjected to an oscillatory shear flow leads to development of nematic order that arises from the phenomenon of phase synchronization. The synchronized state corresponds to a unique, stable limit cycle confined in the toroidal state space. The limit cycle exists since, unlike rigid particles, deformable particles can modulate aspect ratio, adjust their tumbling rate and thus, achieve phase synchronization. These synchronized regions emerge as Arnold tongues in the parameter-space of the driving amplitude and frequency. Considering the rheological implications of ordering dynamics in soft and active matter, our results motivate oscillatory shear flow experiments with deformable particles.

Title: Detection of 2D SPT Order with Partial Symmetries
Authors: Alex Turzillo, Naren Manjunath, Jose Garre-Rubio
Abstract: A method of using partial symmetries to distinguish two dimensional symmetry protected topological (SPT) phases of on-site, unitary symmetries is proposed. This novel order parameter takes a wavefunction, such as a ground state of a lattice model, and detects its SPT invariants as expectation values of finitely supported operators, without the need for flux insertion. The construction exploits the rotational symmetry of the lattice to extract on-site SPT invariants, building upon prior work on probing crystalline SPT phases with partial rotations. The method is demonstrated by computing the order parameter analytically on group cohomology models and numerically on a family of states interpolating between the CZX state and a trivial state. Its robustness is suggested by interpreting partial symmetries as generating the topological partition functions of lens spaces.

Title: Dynamical scaling study for the estimation of dynamical exponent $z$ of three-dimensional XY spin glass model
Authors: Yusuke Terasawa, Yukiyasu Ozeki
Abstract: To analyze the $\pm J$ XY spin-glass in three dimensions, we verified a method aimed at obtaining a high-precision dynamical exponent $z$ from the correlation length in the nonequilibrium relaxation process. The obtained $z$ yielded consistent and highly accurate results in previous studies for relatively well-studied models -- specifically, the three-dimensional (3D) ferromagnetic Ising model and the 3D $\pm J$ Ising model. Building on these previous studies, we used this method and the dynamical scaling method to analyze the 3D $\pm J$ XY model and obtained highly precise critical temperatures and exponents. These findings support the spin chirality decoupling picture, explaining the experimental spin-glass phase transition.

Title: Pressure Induced Altermagnetism in Layered Ternary Iron-Selenides
Authors: Zilong Li, Xin Ma, Siqi Wu, H.-Q. Yuan, Jianhui Dai, Chao Cao
Abstract: Employing first-principles based calculations, we reexamined the high-pressure phases of the vacancy-ordered iron-selenides, i.e. A2Fe4Se5 phase. A magnetic transition from the block-spin antiferromagnetic phase to Neel-AM phase is observed under high pressure when the iron-vacancy order is preserved. The transition is first-order, driven by the collapse of c-axis and accompanied by an insulator-metal transition. In addition, the Neel-AM phase is a rare example of intrinsic altermagnetism that does not require ligand atoms nor supercell construction to break the spatial inversion or translational symmetry between the two spin sublattices, with a spin-splitting of the band structure as large as 300 meV. If the re-entrant superconducting phase of KyFe2-xSe2 under high pressure emerges from the Neel-AM normal state, an equal-spin triplet pairing would be naturally favored.

Title: Single-step high-fidelity three-qubit gates by anisotropic chiral interactions
Authors: Minh T. P. Nguyen, Maximilian Rimbach-Russ, Lieven M. K. Vandersypen, Stefano Bosco
Abstract: Direct multi-qubit gates are becoming critical to facilitate quantum computations in near-term devices by reducing the gate counts and circuit depth. Here, we demonstrate that fast and high fidelity three-qubit gates can be realized in a single step by leveraging small anisotropic and chiral three-qubit interactions. These ingredients naturally arise in state-of-the-art spin-based quantum hardware through a combination of spin-orbit interactions and orbital magnetic fields. These interactions resolve the key synchronization issues inherent in protocols relying solely on two-qubit couplings, which significantly limit gate fidelity. We confirm with numerical simulations that our single-step three-qubit gate can outperform existing protocols, potentially achieving infidelity $\leq 10^{-4}$ in 80-100 ns under current experimental conditions. To further benchmark its performance, we also propose an alternative composite three-qubit gate sequence based on anisotropic two-qubit interactions with built-in echo sequence and show that the single-step protocol can outperform it, making it highly suitable for near-term quantum processors.

Title: Stabilizing open photon condensates by ghost-attractor dynamics
Authors: Aya Abouelela, Michael Turaev, Roman Kramer, Moritz Janning, Michael Kajan, Sayak Ray, Johann Kroha
Abstract: We study the temporal, driven-dissipative dynamics of open photon Bose-Einstein condensates (BEC) in a dye-filled microcavity, taking the condensate amplitude and the noncondensed fluctuations into account on the same footing by means of a cumulant expansion within the Lindblad formalism. The fluctuations fundamentally alter the dynamics in that the BEC always dephases to zero for sufficiently long time. However, a ghost-attractor, although it is outside of the physically accessible configuration space, attracts the dynamics and leads to a plateau-like stabilization of the BEC for an exponentially long time, consistent with experiments. We also show that the photon BEC and the lasing state are separated by a true phase transition, since they are characterized by different fixed points. The ghost-attractor nonequilibrium stabilization mechanism is alternative to prethermalization and may possibly be realized on other dynamical platforms as well.

Title: Is Herbertsmithite far from an ideal antiferromagnet? Ab-initio answer including in-plane Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions and coupling with extra-plane impurities
Authors: Flaurent Heully-Alary, Nadia Ben Amor, Nicolas Suaud, Laura Messio, Coen de Graaf, Nathalie Guihéry
Abstract: Herbertsmithite is known as the archetype of a S=1/2 first-neighbor Heisenberg antiferromagnet on the kagomé lattice, theoretically presumed to be a quantum gapless spin liquid. However, more and more experiments reveal that the model suffers from deviations from the ideal one, evidenced at very low temperatures. This detailed ab initio study focuses on two such deviations that have never been quantitatively calculated: the anisotropic exchange interactions and the Heisenberg exchange with extra-plane magnetic impurities. The Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction is found to have an in-plane component almost three times larger than the out-of-plane component, but typically obviated in theoretical studies. Moreover, it is shown that the extra-plane magnetic impurities have a strong ferromagnetic interaction (minus half the main exchange $J_1$ ) with the kagomé magnetic sites. Combined with an estimated occurrence of these magnetic impurities of $\sim15\%$, the present results indicate that two-dimensional magnetic models only describe part of the physics.

Title: Structural stability, elemental ordering, and transport properties of layered ScTaN2
Authors: Baptiste Julien, Ian A. Leahy, Rebecca W. Smaha, John S. Mangum, Craig L. Perkins, Sage R. Bauers, Andriy Zakutayev
Abstract: Some ternary TM nitrides are predicted to adopt layered structures that make them interesting for thermoelectric conversion and quantum materials applications. Synthesis of TM ternary nitride films by physical vapor deposition often favors disordered 3D structures rather than the predicted 2D-like layered structure. In this study, we investigate the structural interplay in the Sc-Ta-N material system, focusing on ScTaN2. We use a two-step combinatorial approach to deposit Sc-Ta-N films by RF co-sputtering and then process the resulting 3D-structured precursor with RTA. Synchrotron GIWAXS on films annealed at 1200 °C for 20 min reveals the nucleation of the layered structure (P63/mmc) within a composition window of x = Sc/(Sc+Ta) = 0.2-0.5. We estimate the long-range order parameter in stoichiometric ScTaN2 films to be 0.86, corresponding to a fraction of antisites of 7%. Interestingly, we find that the structure can accommodate large off-stoichiometry in the Ta-rich region (x < 0.5), facilitated by making an alloy with the nearly isostructural Ta5N6 compound that exists on a composition tie-line. Transport measurements on ScTaN2 reveal a nearly temperature-independent high carrier density (1021 cm-3), suggesting a heavily doped semiconductor or semimetallic character. The carrier mobility is relatively small (9.5 cm2V-1s-1 at 2 K) and the residual-resistivity ratio is small, suggesting that electrical conduction is dominated by defects or disorder. Measured magnetoresistance is indicative of weak antilocalization at low temperatures. We highlight the interplay between ScTaN2 and Ta5N6 in stabilizing layered structures, emphasizes the importance of cation order/disorder for potential tunable alloys, and suggests that ScTaN2 is promising platform for exploring electronic properties in a tie line of stoichiometry.

Title: Universal low-density power laws of the dc conductivity and Hall constant in the self-consistent Born approximation
Authors: Giacomo Morpurgo, Christophe Berthod, Thierry Giamarchi
Abstract: The dc conductivity tensor of two-dimensional one-band metals with weak pointlike disorder and magnetic field is studied in the self-consistent Born approximation, with special emphasis on the regime of low carrier density. In this theory, the Kubo conductivity is a functional of the electron dispersion and local (momentum-independent) electron self-energy, which is itself a causal functional of the dispersion and disorder strength. We obtain exact closed expressions for the asymptotic low-density conductivities at zero temperature in the form of power laws of the density and disorder strength with universal exponents. The crossover to the semiclassical regime of high density is studied numerically, as well as the temperature dependence. Our model and results may be relevant to interpret linear magneto-transport experiments performed in the metallic regime of gated two-dimensional semiconductors.

Title: Prethermalization in Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou chains
Authors: Gabriel M. Lando, Sergej Flach
Abstract: The observation of the Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) paradox, namely the lack of equipartition in the evolution of a normal mode in a nonlinear chain on unexpectedly long times, is arguably the most famous numerical experiment in the history of physics. Seventy years after the original publication, most studies in FPUT chains still focus on long wavelength initial states similar to the original paper. It is shown here that all characteristic features of the FPUT paradox are rendered even more striking if modes with short(er) wavelengths are evolved instead. Since not every normal mode leads to equipartition, we also provide a simple technique to predict which modes, and in what perturbation order, are excited starting from an initial mode (root) in $\alpha$-FPUT chains. The excitation sequences associated with a root are then numerically shown to spread energy at different speeds, leading to prethermalization regimes that become longer as a function of mode excitation number. This effect is visible in observables such as mode energies and spectral entropies and, surprisingly, also in the time evolution of invariant quantities such as Lyapunov times and Kolmogorov-Sinai entropies. Our findings generalize the original FPUT experiment, provide an original look at the paradox's source, and enrich the vast literature dedicated to studying equipartition in classical many-body systems.

Title: Randomly measured quantum particle
Authors: V. Gurarie
Abstract: We consider the motion of a quantum particle whose position is measured in random places at random moments in time. We show that a freely moving particle measured in this way undergoes superdiffusion, while a charged particle moving in a magnetic field confined to the lowest Landau level undergoes conventional diffusion. We also look at a particle moving in one dimensional space in a random time-independent potential, so that it is Anderson localized, which is also measured at random points in space and randomly in time. We find that random measurements break localization and this particle also undergoes diffusion. To address these questions, we develop formalism similar to that employed when studying classical and quantum problems with time-dependent noise.

Title: Phonon mediated spin polarization in a one-dimensional Aubry-Andre-Harper chain
Authors: Moumita Mondal, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: A comparative study of electronic transport and spin polarization between clean and Aubry-Andre-Harper chains in the presence of electron-electron (e-e) and electron-phonon (e-ph) interactions is presented. The entire system is simulated within a tight-binding framework based on the Hubbard-Holstein model. Trans-mission probability and spin polarization are evaluated using the Green's function method under the Hartree-Fock mean-field approximation through a self-consistent procedure. The transmission profile is found to be consistent with the band structure, which is also discussed. An overall enhancement of spin polariza-tion induced by e-ph interaction is reported for the first time, to the best of our knowledge. Our analysis may be useful for studying controlled spin-selective electron transmission in the presence of e-ph coupling.

Title: Switching of an antiferromagnet controlled by spin canting in a laser-induced hidden phase
Authors: A. V. Kuzikova, N. A. Liubachko, S. N. Barilo, A. V. Sadovnikov, R. V. Pisarev, A. M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: During laser-induced phase transitions, fast transformations of electronic, atomic, and spin configurations often involve emergence of hidden and metastable phases. Being inaccessible under any other stimuli, such phases are indispensable for unveiling mechanisms and controlling the transitions. We experimentally explore spin kinetics during ultrafast first-order 90$^{\circ}$ spin-reorientation (SR) transition in a canted antiferromagnet Fe$_3$BO$_6$, and reveal that the transition is controlled by the canting between the magnetic sublattices. Laser-induced perturbation of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction results in a change of the intersublattice canting within first picoseconds, bringing Fe$_3$BO$_6$ to a hidden phase. Once this phase emerges, laser-induced heating activates precessional 90$^\circ$ spin switching. Combination of the spin canting and heating controls the final spin configuration comprising coexisting initial and switched phases. Extended phase coexistence range is in a striking contrast to the narrow SR transition in Fe$_3$BO$_6$ induced by conventional heating.

Title: How to Train an Oscillator Ising Machine using Equilibrium Propagation
Authors: Alex Gower
Abstract: We show that Oscillator Ising Machines (OIMs) are prime candidates for use as neuromorphic machine learning processors with Equilibrium Propagation (EP) based on-chip learning. The inherent energy gradient descent dynamics of OIMs, combined with their standard CMOS implementation using existing fabrication processes, provide a natural substrate for EP learning. Our simulations confirm that OIMs satisfy the gradient-descending update property necessary for a scalable Equilibrium Propagation implementation and achieve $\sim 97.2\pm0.1\%$ test accuracy on MNIST and $\sim 88.0\pm0.1\%$ on Fashion-MNIST without requiring any significant hardware modifications. Importantly, OIMs maintain robust performance under realistic hardware constraints, including 10-bit parameter quantization, 4-bit phase measurement precision, and moderate phase noise that can potentially be beneficial with parameter optimization. These results establish OIMs as a promising platform for fast and energy-efficient neuromorphic computing, potentially enabling energy-based learning algorithms that have been previously constrained by computational limitations.

Title: Emergent magnetism and spin liquids in an extended Hubbard description of moiré bilayers
Authors: Zhenhao Song, Urban F. P. Seifert, Leon Balents, Hong-Chen Jiang
Abstract: Motivated by twisted transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), we study an extended Hubbard model with both on-site and off-site repulsive interactions, in which Mott insulating states with concomitant charge order occur at fractional fillings. To resolve the charge ordering as well as the fate of the local moments formed thereby, we perform large-scale density matrix renormalization group calculations on cylindrical geometries for several filling fractions and ranges of interaction strength. Depending on the precise parameter regime, both antiferromagnetically ordered as well as quantum-disordered states are found, with a particularly prominent example being a quantum spin liquid-type ground state on top of charge-ordering with effective Kagomé geometry. We discuss the different mechanisms at play in stabilizing various electronic and magnetic states. The results suggest that moiré TMDs are a promising venue for emergent quantum magnetism of strongly interacting electrons.

Title: Hyperelastic characterization via deep indentation
Authors: Mohammad Shojaeifard, Mattia Bacca
Abstract: Hyperelastic material characterization is crucial for understanding the behavior of soft materials -- such as tissues, rubbers, hydrogels, and polymers -- under quasi-static loading before failure. Traditional methods typically rely on uniaxial tensile tests, which require the cumbersome preparation of dumbbell-shaped samples for clamping in a uniaxial testing machine. In contrast, indentation-based methods, which can be conducted \textit{in-situ} without sample preparation, have been underexplored. To characterize the hyperelastic behavior of soft materials, deep indentation is required, where the material response extends beyond linear elasticity. In this study, we perform finite element analysis to link the force ($F$) versus indentation depth ($D$) curve with the hyperelastic behavior of a soft incompressible material, using a one-term Ogden model for simplicity. We identify three indentation regimes based on the ratio between indentation depth and the radius ($R$) of the spherical-tipped cylindrical indenter: the Hertzian regime ($D < 0.1R$), where $F = \frac{16}{9} E R^{0.5} D^{1.5}$; the parabolic regime ($D > 10R$), where $F = E D^2 \beta$ and the indenter radius becomes irrelevant; and an intermediate regime ($0.1R < D < 10R$) bridging the two extremes. We find that the Ogden strain-stiffening coefficient ($\alpha$) increases the parabolic indentation coefficient ($\beta$), allowing for the estimation of $\alpha$ from $\beta$. Furthermore, we observe that Coulomb friction increases $\beta$, potentially masking the effect of strain-stiffening for small $\alpha$. However, for $\alpha > 3$, friction has a negligible effect. Finally, our results show good agreement with experimental data, demonstrating that deep indentation can be an effective method for extracting hyperelastic properties from soft materials through \textit{in-situ} testing.

Title: Double Supersolid Phase in a Bosonic t-J-V Model with Rydberg Atoms
Authors: Kuangjie Chen, Yang Qi, Zheng Yan, Xiaopeng Li
Abstract: Recent advances in Rydberg tweezer arrays bring novel opportunities for programmable quantum simulations beyond previous capabilities. In this work, we investigate a bosonic t-J-V model currently realized with Rydberg atoms. Through large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulations, we uncover an emergent double supersolid (DSS) phase with the coexistence of two superfluids and crystalline order. Tunable long-range tunneling and repulsive hole-hole interactions enable a rich phase diagram featuring a double superfluid phase, a DSS phase, and an antiferromagnetic insulator. Intriguingly, within the DSS regime we observe an unconventional thermal enhancement of crystalline order. Our results establish the bosonic t-J-V model as a promising and experimentally accessible platform for exploring exotic quantum phases in Rydberg atom arrays.

Title: Coordination-Driven Classification and Energetic Scaling of Boron Fullerenes and Borophene
Authors: Nevill Gonzalez Szwacki
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of boron fullerenes and two-dimensional boron sheets, unified under a coordination-based framework. By classifying over a dozen boron nanostructures, including B$_{12}$, B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, B$_{65}$, B$_{80}$, and B$_{92}$, according to their local atomic environments (4-, 5-, and 6-fold coordination), we identify clear trends in structural stability, electronic properties, and magnetism. A universal energetic scaling relation $E_c(n) = -a/n^b + E_c^{\mathrm{sheet}}$, with $b = 0.4$ or $b = 0.9$ depending on the coordination family, captures the convergence of fullerene cohesive energies toward those of 2D boron phases. Notably, we establish one-to-one structural correspondences between select cages and experimentally accessible borophenes: B$_{40}$ mirrors the $\chi^3$-sheet, B$_{65}$ the $\beta_{12}$-sheet, B$_{80}$ the $\alpha$-sheet, and B$_{92}$ the $bt$-sheet. Our analysis reveals two distinct families of boron nanostructures based on the scaling exponent: one with $b = 0.9$, comprising structures with significant 6-fold coordination, and another with $b = 0.4$, which includes B$_{40}$, B$_{38}$, and two experimentally observed borophenes. These clusters also exhibit large HOMO--LUMO gaps (e.g., $E_g = 1.78$~eV for B$_{40}$, 1.14~eV for B$_{92}$), contrasting with the metallicity of their 2D counterparts and, in the case of B$_{65}$, spontaneous spin polarization ($M = 3\mu_B$). Our findings provide a predictive strategy for designing boron nanostructures by leveraging coordination fingerprints, and are further validated by the recent experimental synthesis of the B$_{80}$ cage. This work bridges zero- and two-dimensional boron chemistry, offering a roadmap for the future synthesis and application of boron-based materials.

Title: Pairing symmetry and superconductivity in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films
Authors: Wenyuan Qiu, Zhihui Luo, Xunwu Hu, Dao-Xin Yao
Abstract: The recent discovery of superconductivity with a transition temperature $T_c$ over 40 K in La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ and (La,Pr)$_{3}$Ni$_2$O$_7$ thin films at ambient pressure marks an important step in the field of nickelate superconductors. Here, we perform a renormalized mean-field theory study of the superconductivity in $\mathrm{La_3Ni_2O_7}$ thin films, using a bilayer two-orbital $t-J$ model. Our result reveals an $s_\pm$-wave pairing symmetry driven by the strong interlayer superexchange coupling of $d_{z^2}$ orbital, resembling the pressurized bulk case. Also, we roughly reproduce the experimentally observed nodeless shape of the superconducting gap at the $\beta$ pocket and the superconducting $T_c$. In addition, by analysing the orbital-resolved pairing configurations and their projections onto Fermi surface, we find that the nodeless feature of $\beta$ pocket is related to the interlayer pairing within both $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals. Moreover, we identify a formation of the inplane inter-orbital $d$-wave pairing between $d_{z^2}$ and $d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals, which can even enhance the dominated interlayer $s_\pm$-wave.

Title: BaCd2P2: a defect-resistant "GaAs"
Authors: Gideon Kassa, Zhenkun Yuan, Muhammad R. Hasan, Guillermo L. Esparza, David P. Fenning, Geoffroy Hautier, Kirill Kovnir, Jifeng Liu
Abstract: BaCd2P2 (BCP) has recently been identified as a promising solar absorber with excellent optoelectronic properties. Here we demonstrate the defect tolerance in BCP by comparing its optoelectronic quality with that of the well-studied absorber GaAs. Despite having a low precursor purity, our synthesized BCP samples exhibit a bright band-to-band room-temperature photoluminescence with low surface recombination losses, a high implied open-circuit voltage, and a carrier lifetime of ~300 ns, all better than those of GaAs samples obtained from a high-purity single-crystalline wafer. In contrast, GaAs samples synthesized using similar methods as BCP show no band-to-band photoluminescence emissions. To better probe the bulk properties and understand the high optoelectronic performance of BCP, we perform first-principles defect calculations and show that BCP has a much lower Shockley-Read-Hall nonradiative recombination rate compared to GaAs. Our results reveal BCP is robust to impurities introduced during synthesis and defect mediated nonradiative recombination, demonstrating its high photovoltaic potential.

Title: Gliding microtubules exhibit tunable collective rotation driven by chiral active forces

Abstract: How chirality propagates across scales remains an open question in many biological and synthetic systems. An especially clear manifestation of this propagation is found in in vitro gliding assays of cytoskeletal filaments on surfaces, driven by molecular motors. These assays have become model systems of active matter dynamics, as they spontaneously organize into diverse dynamical states, including collective motions with chiral rotation. However, the microscopic mechanisms underlying these chiral collective dynamics have remained unclear. Here, we investigate rotating active nematic order in microtubule gliding assay experiments under two stabilization conditions, each on two types of substrates. We propose that chirality in active forces exerted by motors on microtubules represents a viable mechanism for this large-scale chirality. Using Brownian dynamics simulations of self-propelled, semiflexible filaments with chiral activity, we demonstrate that coherently rotating active nematic order emerges by this mechanism even in the absence of curvature, i.e. shape chirality, of the constituent filaments. Moreover, we predict that the angular speed and handedness of the collective rotation can be tuned by modulating filament stiffness. Our findings identify a new set of sufficient microscopic ingredients for predictable propagation of chiral handedness from the molecular to the material scale in living and active matter.

Authors: Mikhail Pekker, Mikhail N. Shneider
Abstract: In this paper, the tunneling mechanism of cavitation in liquid helium for $^3$He and $^4$He is considered on the basis of the Schrödinger-like equation. It is assumed that the pairwise interactions of helium atoms are determined by the Lennard-Jones potential. The kinetics of nucleation and the mechanism that limits the growth of cavitation bubbles in liquid helium are considered, taking into account their growth in a negative pressure field.

Title: Spin-charge bound states and emerging fermions in a quantum spin liquid
Authors: Jens H. Nyhegn, Kristian Knakkergaard Nielsen, Leon Balents, Georg M. Bruun
Abstract: The complex interplay between charge and spin dynamics lies at the heart of strongly correlated quantum materials, and it is a fundamental topic in basic research with far reaching technological perspectives. We explore in this paper the dynamics of holes in a single band extended $t-J$ model where the background spins form a $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ quantum spin liquid (QSL). Using a field theory approach based on a parton construction, we show that while the electrons for most momenta fractionalize into uncorrelated charge carrying holons and spin carrying spinons as generally expected for a QSL, the spinon-holon scattering cross-section diverges for certain momenta signalling strong correlations. By deriving an effective low-energy Hamiltonian describing this dynamics, we demonstrate that these divergencies are due to the formation of long lived spinon-holon bound states. We then show that quantum gas microscopy with atoms in optical lattices provides an excellent platform for verifying and probing the internal spatial structure of these emergent fermions. The fermions will furthermore show up as clear quasiparticle peaks in angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy with an intensity determined by their internal structure. For a non-zero hole concentration, the fermions form hole pockets with qualitatively the same location, shape, and intensity variation in the Brillouin zone as the so-called Fermi arcs observed in the pseudogap phase. Such agreement is remarkable since the Fermi arcs arise from the delicate interplay between the symmetry of the QSL and the internal structure of the emerging fermions in a minimal single band model with no extra degrees of freedom added. Our results, therefore, provide a microscopic mechanism for the conjectured fractionalized Fermi liquid and open up new pathways for exploring the pseudogap phase and high temperature superconductivity as arising from a QSL.

Title: Longitudinal magnon transport properties in the easy-axis XXZ Heisenberg ferromagnet on the face-centered cubic lattice
Authors: M. R. Parymuda
Abstract: We present a detailed investigation of longitudinal magneto-thermal transport in the $S=1/2$ ferromagnetic XXZ model with easy-axis exchange anisotropy ($\Delta>1$) on a face-centered cubic lattice consisting of four sublattices. We employ linear spin-wave theory and the Kubo formalism to evaluate the longitudinal spin and thermal conductivities, both of which exhibit activated temperature dependence in the low-temperature regime, and to determine their magnetic-field dependence. Our analysis indicates that a magnon gap is crucial for ensuring the convergence of these conductivities. Furthermore, by examining the ratio of thermal conductivity to spin conductivity, we identify an analog of the Wiedemann-Franz law for magnon transport at low temperatures. Finally, we demonstrate that these results can be generalized to systems with arbitrary spin.

Title: Unlocking high coercivity at room temperature in phase modified MoS$_2$
Authors: Zainab Chowdhry, Kushal Mazumder, Praveen Hegde, Ajith Jena, Vidya Praveen Bhallamudi, Pramoda K. Nayak
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) materials showing room-temperature magnetism and high coercivity are desired for combining magnetism with semiconducting properties useful for spintronics. In this work, the magnetic properties of the 1T phase of MoS$_2$ have been studied at room temperature. We observe ferromagnetism with a coercivity of ~0.3 T and a maximum saturation magnetization of 0.26 emu/g at room temperature. This is the highest among coercivities reported so far in 2D magnets at room temperature. MoS$_2$ nanosheets are prepared using a single-step hydrothermal synthesis with a relative 1T-phase reaching up to 77%. We report a correlation between the structural and magnetic characteristics via interplanar distance and coercivity. The increase in interplanar distance is also accompanied by an increase in the 1T phase. Our results pave a useful way of controlling the coercivity and saturation magnetization in a 2D magnet with applications in spintronics and low-power quantum devices.

Title: Fractional Brownian Motion with Negative Hurst Exponent
Authors: Baruch Meerson, Pavel V. Sasorov
Abstract: Fractional Brownian motion (fBm) is an important scale-invariant Gaussian non-Markovian process with stationary increments, which serves as a prototypical example of a system with long-range temporal correlations and anomalous diffusion. The fBm is traditionally defined for the Hurst exponent $H$ in the range $0<H<1$. Here we extend this definition to the strongly anti-persistent regime $-1/2<H<0$. The extended fBm is not a pointwise process, so we regularize it via a local temporal averaging with a narrow filter. The extended fBm turns out to be stationary, and we derive its autocorrelation function. The stationarity implies a complete arrest of diffusion in this region of $H$. We also determine the variance of a closely related Gaussian process: the stationary fractional Ornstein--Uhlenbeck (fOU) process, extended to the range $-1/2<H<0$ and smoothed in the same way as the fBm. Remarkably, the smoothed fOU process turns out to be insensitive to the strength of the confining potential. Finally, we determine the optimal paths of the conditioned fBm and fOU processes for $-1/2<H<0$. In the marginal case $H=0$, our results match continuously with known results for the traditionally defined fBm and fOU processes.

Title: New universality classes govern the critical and multicritical behavior of an active Ising model
Authors: Matthew Wong, Chiu Fan Lee
Abstract: The Ising model is one of the most well known models in statistical physics, with its critical behavior governed by the Wilson-Fisher universality class (UC). When active motility is incorporated into the Ising model by, e.g., dictating that the spins' directional movements follow their orientations, the spin number density necessarily constitutes a soft mode in the hydrodynamic description, and can therefore modify the scaling behavior of the system. Here, we show that this is indeed the case in a critical active Ising model in which density can impede the system's collective motion. Specifically, we use a perturbative dynamic renormalization group method to the one-loop level to uncover three new UCs, one of which supersedes the Wilson-Fisher UC to become the generic UC that governs the critical behavior of the active Ising model.

Title: Reference compositions for bismuth telluride thermoelectric materials for low-temperature power generation
Authors: Nirma Kumari, Jaywan Chung, Seunghyun Oh, Jeongin Jang, Jongho Park, Ji Hui Son, SuDong Park, Byungki Ryu
Abstract: Thermoelectric (TE) technology enables direct heat-to-electricity conversion and is gaining attention as a clean, fuel-saving, and carbon-neutral solution for industrial, automotive, and marine applications. Despite nearly a century of research, apart from successes in deep-space power sources and solid-state cooling modules, the industrialization and commercialization of TE power generation remain limited. Since the new millennium, nanostructured bulk materials have accelerated the discovery of new TE systems. However, due to limited access to high-temperature heat sources, energy harvesting still relies almost exclusively on BiTe-based alloys, which are the only system operating stably near room temperature. Although many BiTe-based compositions have been proposed, concerns over reproducibility, reliability, and lifetime continue to hinder industrial adoption. Here, we aim to develop reference BiTe-based thermoelectric materials through data-driven analysis of Starrydata2, the world's largest thermoelectric database. We identify Bi0.46Sb1.54Te3 and Bi2Te2.7Se0.3 as the most frequently studied ternary compositions. These were synthesized using hot pressing and spark-plasma sintering. Thermoelectric properties were evaluated with respect to the processing method and measurement direction. The results align closely with the median of reported data, confirming the representativeness of the selected compositions. We propose these as reference BiTe materials, accompanied by transparent data and validated benchmarks. Their use can support the standardization of TE legs and modules while accelerating performance evaluation and industrial integration. We further estimated the performance of a thermoelectric module made from the reference composition, which gives the power output of over 2.51 W and an efficiency of 3.58% at a temperature difference of 120 K.

Title: Symmetry-enhanced Lieb-Robinson bounds for a class of Bose-Hubbard type Hamiltonians
Authors: Tomotaka Kuwahara, Marius Lemm
Abstract: Several recent works have derived Lieb-Robinson bounds (LRBs) for Bose-Hubbard-type Hamiltonians. For certain structured initial states, e.g., vacuum perturbations or near-stationary states, information propagates with velocity $v \leq C$ . However, for general bounded-density initial states, it was shown by the first author, Vu, and Saito that the velocity can grow in time as $v \sim t^{D-1}$, where $D$ is the spatial dimension -- demonstrating the possibility of accelerated information spreading in bosonic systems. In this work, we introduce a new perspective on this phenomenon: we show that translation invariance combined with local $p$-body repulsion ($n^p$ with $p > D+1$) qualitatively alters the propagation behavior, leading to a bound of the form $v \sim t^{\frac{D}{p - D - 1}}$ for general bounded-energy-density initial states. In particular, this establishes for an almost-linear light cone at large $p$, in stark contrast to the previously found accelerated regimes. Our result identifies symmetry-driven constraints as a new mechanism for suppressing propagation speed in bosonic systems and thereby reframes the scope of what types of LRBs can hold. We further provide matching examples showing that, under the given assumptions, this bound is sharp -- no further improvement in the power of $t$ is possible without invoking additional dynamical constraints.

Title: Study of entanglement and phase transitions in the coupled top systems with standard and nonstandard symmetries
Authors: Rashmi Jangid Sharma, Jayendra N. Bandyopadhyay
Abstract: We study classical and quantum versions of a coupled top system in the absence and the presence of nonlinear torsion in the individual top. The model without the torsion and couples two identical tops is well-known in the literature as the Feingold-Peres (FP) model. The permutation and chiral symmetries are preserved in the FP model. This model is classified under the BDI or chiral orthogonal symmetry class, one of the recently proposed nonstandard symmetry classes. For the nonzero torsional cases, we study two different models:(i) identical torsional term in the individual top (NZT-I model); (ii) non-identical torsional term due to their opposite sign in the individual top (NZT-II model). The NZT-I model has the permutation symmetry but no chiral symmetry; hence, this model is classified under the standard three-fold symmetry classes. On the other hand, the NZT-II model does not have permutation symmetry but has chiral symmetry; hence, this model is also classified as a nonstandard BDI symmetry class. In this study, we investigate the role of underlying symmetries on the entanglement between the two tops. Moreover, we explore the interrelations among classical phase space dynamics, energy transitions, and the entanglement between the tops.

Title: Integrability is generic in homogeneous U(1)-invariant nearest-neighbor qubit circuits

Abstract: Integrability is an exceptional property believed to hold only for systems with fine-tuned parameters. Contrary, we explicitly show that in homogeneous nearest-neighbor qubit circuits with a U(1) symmetry, i.e., circuits that repeatedly apply the same magnetization-conserving two-qubit gate, this is not the case. There, integrability is generic: all such brickwall qubit circuits are integrable, even with a randomly selected gate. We identify two phases with different conservation laws, transport properties, and strong zero edge modes. Experimentally important is the fact that varying any one of the parameters in the generic U(1) gate, one will typically cross the critical manifold that separates the two phases. Finally, we report on an unconventional time-reversal symmetry causing the system with open boundary conditions to be in the orthogonal class, while the one with periodic boundary conditions is in the unitary class.

Title: Quantum Thermal Analogs of Electric Circuits: A Universal Approach
Authors: Devvrat Tiwari, Samyadeb Bhattacharya, Subhashish Banerjee
Abstract: In this work, we develop a panoramic schematic of quantum thermal analogs of electric circuits in the steady state regime. We establish the foundations of said premise by defining the analogs of Kirchhoff's laws for heat currents and temperature gradients, as well as a quantum thermal step transformer. Using this, we develop two novel quantum thermal circuits, viz., quantum thermal super Wheatstone bridge and quantum thermal adder circuit, paving the way for the corresponding integrated circuits. We further show that our approach encompasses various circuits like thermal diode, transistor, and Wheatstone bridge. This sheds new light on the present architecture of quantum device engineering.

Title: Fundamental precision limits in finite-dimensional quantum thermal machines
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa
Abstract: Enhancing the precision of a thermodynamic process inevitably necessitates a thermodynamic cost. This notion was recently formulated as the thermodynamic uncertainty relation, which states that the relative variance of thermodynamic currents decreases as entropy production increases. From another viewpoint, the thermodynamic uncertainty relation implies that if entropy production were allowed to become infinitely large, the relative variance could approach zero. However, it is evident that realizing infinitely large entropy production is infeasible in reality. This indicates that physical constraints impose fundamental precision limits on the system, independent of its dynamics. In this study, we derive dynamics-independent bounds on the relative variance and the expectation of observables for open quantum thermal machines operating within a finite-dimensional system and environment. These bounds are governed by the minimum eigenvalue factor, which sets the maximum entropy production attainable by the quantum dynamics and mirrors the concept of dynamical activity in classical stochastic thermodynamics. Additionally, we investigate how quantum coherence affects these fundamental bounds, demonstrating that the presence of coherence can enhance the precision limits. Our findings provide insights into fundamental limits on the precision of quantum thermal machines.

Title: Orthogonal projections of hypercubes
Authors: Yoshiaki Horiike, Shin Fujishiro
Abstract: Projections of hypercubes have been applied to visualize high-dimensional binary state spaces in various scientific fields. Conventional methods for projecting hypercubes, however, face practical difficulties. Manual methods require nontrivial adjustments of the projection basis, while optimization-based algorithms limit the interpretability and reproducibility of the resulting plots. These limitations motivate us to explore theoretically analyzable projection algorithms such as principal component analysis (PCA). Here, we investigate the mathematical properties of PCA-projected hypercubes. Our numerical and analytical results show that PCA effectively captures polarized distributions within the hypercubic state space. This property enables the assessment of the asymptotic distribution of projected vertices and error bounds, which characterize the performance of PCA in the projected space. We demonstrate the application of PCA to visualize the hypercubic energy landscapes of Ising spin systems. By adding projected hypercubic edges, these visualizations reveal pathways of correlated spin flips. We confirm that the time-integrated probability flux exhibits patterns consistent with the pathways identified in the projected hypercubic energy landscapes. Using the mean-field model, we show that dominant state transition pathways tend to emerge around the periphery of the projected hypercubes. Our work provides a better understanding of how PCA discovers hidden patterns in high-dimensional binary data.

Title: (How) Can Transformers Predict Pseudo-Random Numbers?
Authors: Tao Tao, Darshil Doshi, Dayal Singh Kalra, Tianyu He, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: Transformers excel at discovering patterns in sequential data, yet their fundamental limitations and learning mechanisms remain crucial topics of investigation. In this paper, we study the ability of Transformers to learn pseudo-random number sequences from linear congruential generators (LCGs), defined by the recurrence relation $x_{t+1} = a x_t + c \;\mathrm{mod}\; m$. We find that with sufficient architectural capacity and training data variety, Transformers can perform in-context prediction of LCG sequences with unseen moduli ($m$) and parameters ($a,c$). By analyzing the embedding layers and attention patterns, we uncover how Transformers develop algorithmic structures to learn these sequences in two scenarios of increasing complexity. First, we investigate how Transformers learn LCG sequences with unseen ($a, c$) but fixed modulus; and demonstrate successful learning up to $m = 2^{32}$. We find that models learn to factorize $m$ and utilize digit-wise number representations to make sequential predictions. In the second, more challenging scenario of unseen moduli, we show that Transformers can generalize to unseen moduli up to $m_{\text{test}} = 2^{16}$. In this case, the model employs a two-step strategy: first estimating the unknown modulus from the context, then utilizing prime factorizations to generate predictions. For this task, we observe a sharp transition in the accuracy at a critical depth $d= 3$. We also find that the number of in-context sequence elements needed to reach high accuracy scales sublinearly with the modulus.

Title: Variational Transformer Ansatz for the Density Operator of Steady States in Dissipative Quantum Many-Body Systems
Authors: Lu Wei, Zhian Jia, Yufeng Wang, Dagomir Kaszlikowski, Haibin Ling
Abstract: The transformer architecture, known for capturing long-range dependencies and intricate patterns, has extended beyond natural language processing. Recently, it has attracted significant attention in quantum information and condensed matter physics. In this work, we propose the \textit{transformer density operator ansatz} for determining the steady states of dissipative quantum many-body systems. By vectorizing the density operator as a many-body state in a doubled Hilbert space, the transformer encodes the amplitude and phase of the state's coefficients, with its parameters serving as variational variables. Our design preserves translation invariance while leveraging attention mechanisms to capture diverse long-range correlations. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by numerically calculating the steady states of dissipative Ising and Heisenberg spin chain models, showing that our method achieves excellent accuracy in predicting mixed steady states.

Title: DNA Nanotechnology for Superradiance
Authors: Jaewon Lee, Sung Hun Park, Jangwon Kim, Kyung Hun Rho, Hoyoung Lee, Soyeon Kim, Seungwoo Lee
Abstract: Superradiance, first proposed by Dicke in 1954, is a highly efficient quantum light source that differs from conventional spontaneous emission. Unlike typical spontaneous emission, where intensity scales linearly with the number of electric dipoles, superradiance exhibits an intensity that scales quadratically with the number of electric dipoles. Similarly, the decay rate also increases proportionally to the dipole numbers. This collective emission is especially powerful when it manifests as superfluorescence, a physical regime of superradiance where spontaneously emerging coherence is achieved by arranging excited dipoles in the same orientation within a volume much smaller than their emission wavelength. Numerous experimental strategies have been employed to generate superradiance, with one common approach being the use of stochastically formed aggregates of quantum dots and organic dyes. However, the inherent randomness in such systems prevents precise control over the number, spatial distribution, and relative orientation of the emitters. This often leads to non-uniform coupling strengths and parasitic dephasing effects, which make it difficult to predict the resulting quantum emission and limit its use in engineered devices. A deterministic platform that provides precise control over these parameters is therefore essential for realizing the full potential of superradiant systems. Here, we (i) specifically outline the advantages of DNA nanotechnology in tackling this challenge, (ii) discuss the reasons why superradiance has not yet been realized even with the state-of-the art DNA nanotechnology, and (iii) propose potential solutions for overcoming the current limitations.

Authors: Han-Ze Li, Jian-Xin Zhong, Xue-Jia Yu
Abstract: Measurement-induced entanglement phase transitions (MIET) highlight how local measurements drive quantum systems between area-law and volume-law entangled states. This review surveys MIET in free fermion models, focusing on how unitary hopping competes with measurement-induced non-unitarity. We discuss controversies regarding the existence of MIET in one dimension, the impact of non-Hermitian skin effects, and potential experimental platforms. We conclude with open challenges, including feedback control and higher-dimensional extensions.

Title: Bubble-assisted micromixing via thermally excited intrinsic air within microfluidic systems
Authors: Seyed Shahriar Riazi, Seyed Mostafa Hosseinalipour
Abstract: The micromixing process in microfluidic devices is of central importance in quite a few applications, with microfluidic studies on carbon capture and environmental monitoring being two examples. High surface area to volume ratio in microscale flows outweighs the role of interfacial tension manipulation by means of introducing a secondary phase to the main flow in order to augment the typically diffusion-dominant mass transfer operation. In this paper, we introduce an easily integrable continuous flow micromixing scheme implemented on a simple Y-type microchannel based on thermally excited intrinsic air within microchannel. Thanks to the direct contact between the sputtered thin platinum microheater and the co-flowing streams, trapped air in the liquid and/or tiny crevices is employed to generate elongated bubbles with a millisecond lifespan, consuming less than 0.4 W of power and thereby enabling homogeneous mixing. The performance of the micromixer is characterized in terms of the mixing index (MI), and it is shown that immediately ahead of the microheater, the MI exceeds 95% for side-by-side flowing of water at different overall flowrates, namely 4, 10, and 20 uL/min. Interpreting the experimental results, supplemented by scaling arguments, we quantitatively describe the ephemeral role of emerging elongated bubbles in the micromixing process in which the Marangoni as well as Weber numbers are recognized as the characteristic local non-dimensional groups while the enhancing role of tiny daughter microbubbles on the micromixing downstream of the microchannel can be reflected in the Peclet and the Capillary numbers.

Title: Noise tolerance via reinforcement: Learning a reinforced quantum dynamics
Authors: Abolfazl Ramezanpour
Abstract: The performance of quantum simulations heavily depends on the efficiency of noise mitigation techniques and error correction algorithms. Reinforcement has emerged as a powerful strategy to enhance the efficiency of learning and optimization algorithms. In this study, we demonstrate that a reinforced quantum dynamics can exhibit significant robustness against interactions with a noisy environment. We study a quantum annealing process where, through reinforcement, the system is encouraged to maintain its current state or follow a noise-free evolution. A learning algorithm is employed to derive a concise approximation of this reinforced dynamics, reducing the total evolution time and, consequently, the system's exposure to noisy interactions. This also avoids the complexities associated with implementing quantum feedback in such reinforcement algorithms. The efficacy of our method is demonstrated through numerical simulations of reinforced quantum annealing with one- and two-qubit systems under Pauli noise.

Title: Lost in Retraining: Roaming the Parameter Space of Exponential Families Under Closed-Loop Learning
Authors: Fariba Jangjoo, Matteo Marsili, Yasser Roudi
Abstract: Closed-loop learning is the process of repeatedly estimating a model from data generated from the model itself. It is receiving great attention due to the possibility that large neural network models may, in the future, be primarily trained with data generated by artificial neural networks themselves. We study this process for models that belong to exponential families, deriving equations of motions that govern the dynamics of the parameters. We show that maximum likelihood estimation of the parameters endows sufficient statistics with the martingale property and that as a result the process converges to absorbing states that amplify initial biases present in the data. However, we show that this outcome may be prevented if the data contains at least one data point generated from a ground truth model, by relying on maximum a posteriori estimation or by introducing regularisation.

Title: On-chip magnon polaritons in the ultrastrong coupling regime
Authors: Shugo Yoshii, Manuel Müller, Ryo Ohshima, Matthias Althammer, Yuichiro Ando, Hans Huebl, Masashi Shiraishi
Abstract: Light-matter interactions underpin the quantum technologies from quantum information processing to quantum sensing. When the coupling strength of light-matter interactions approaches the resonance frequencies of light and matter - the ultrastrong coupling regime - antiresonant (counter-rotating) processes, in which a photon and a matter excitation are simultaneously created or annihilated, induce non-negligible ground-state quantum entanglement between light and matter. Ultrastrong coupling thus provides a robust platform for noise-tolerant quantum entanglement, essential for reliable quantum technologies. However, the diamagnetic term typically counteracts antiresonant interactions, inhibiting intriguing phenomena such as thermal equibilium superradiant phase transitions. Here, we present an on-chip platform consisting of a superconducting resonator and thin ferromagnetic films achieving ultrastrong magnon-photon coupling system (magnon polaritons) via collective magnetic-dipole interactions, significantly circumventing the diamagnetic term. We experimentally demonstrate a pronounced Bloch-Siegert shift of about 60 MHz - direct evidence of antiresonant interactions - and observe cooperative enhancement of the effective coupling strength through increasing the number of remote magnon elements coupling with one photon mode. This scalable platform facilitates exploration of exotic quantum phenomena driven by antiresonant interactions, bridging spintronics and quantum optics, and enabling noise-tolerant quantum technological applications.

Title: A kinetic model to simulate charge flow through an electrochemical half cell
Authors: Diego Veloza-Diaz, Friederike Schmid, Robinson Cortes-Huerto, Pietro Ballone, Nancy C. Forero-Martinez
Abstract: A kinetic model of the electron transfer at the electrode / electrolyte solution interface is developed, implemented in a Monte Carlo framework, and applied to simulate this process in idealised systems consisting of the primitive model of electrolyte solutions limited by an impenetrable conducting surface. In the present implementation, a charged, spherical interface surrounding an equally spherical sample of electrolyte solution is introduced to model a single-electrode system, providing the computational analog to the conceptual half-cell picture that is widely used in electrochemistry. The electron transfer itself is described as a simple surface hopping process underlying a first order reaction corresponding to one of the coupled M/M$^+$ and X$^-$/X half reactions. Then, the electron transfer at the interface is combined with the self-diffusion of ions in the electrolyte solutions whose role is to supply reagents and disperse products, allowing the system to settle in a stationary non-equilibrium state. Simulations for the primitive model of electrolyte in contact with a charged impenetrable surface show that, after a brief transient, the samples sustain a steady current through the electrolyte solution. The results quantify the dependence of the current on: the overall charge of the electrode, the electrolyte concentration, the solvent viscosity and the kinetic parameter $k_e$ that represents the rate of the electron transfer for each ion in contact with the electrode. Since the simulated interface is very idealised, strategies to overcome the limitations of the present model are outlined and briefly discussed.
