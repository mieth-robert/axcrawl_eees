Title: Two types of $q$-Gaussian distributions used to study the diffusion in a finite region
Authors: Won Sang Chung, L. M. Nieto, Soroush Zare, Hassan Hassanabadi
Abstract: In this work, we explore both the ordinary $q$-Gaussian distribution and a new one defined here, determining both their mean and variance, and we use them to construct solutions of the $q$-deformed diffusion differential equation. This approach allows us to realize that the standard deviation of the distribution must be a function of time. In one case, we derive a linear Fokker-Planck equation within a finite region, revealing a new form of both the position- and time-dependent diffusion coefficient and the corresponding continuity equation. It is noteworthy that, in both cases, the conventional result is obtained when $q$ tends to zero. Furthermore, we derive the deformed diffusion-decay equation in a finite region, also determining the position- and time-dependent decay coefficient. A discrete version of this diffusion-decay equation is addressed, in which the discrete times have a uniform interval, while for the discrete positions the interval is not uniform.

Title: Ambient-pressure superconductivity onset at 10 K and robust Tc under high pressure in TiNbTaN3 medium-entropy nitride
Authors: Lingyong Zeng, Jie Wang, Hongyu Liu, Longfu Li, Jinjun Qin, Yucheng Li, Rui Chen, Jing Song, Yusheng Hou, Huixia Luo
Abstract: Superconductivity has been one of the focal points in medium and high-entropy alloys (MEAs-HEAs) since the first discovery of the HEA superconductor in 2014. Until now, most HEAs' superconducting transition temperature (Tc) has not exceeded 10 K. Here we report the first observation of superconductivity in a bulk medium-entropy nitride (MEN), TiNbTaN3, which shows a Tc of 10 K at ambient pressure. Notably, the electronic specific heat coefficient {\gamma}(H) exhibits nonlinear H-dependence behavior, which is similar to other well-studied multigap superconductors. Furthermore, TiNbTaN3 exhibits extraordinary pressure resilience, maintaining robust superconductivity under high-pressure conditions. Density functional theory (DFT) calculations indicate that pressure exerts a negligible impact on the electronic structures of TiNbTaN3, thereby corroborating the experimental observations. These findings not only advance our understanding of emergent phenomena in entropy-stabilized nitrides but also establish a new material platform for finding more high-Tc superconductors with combinations of 4d/5d transition metal elements and light elements, motivating further investigations into high-entropy functional ceramics for extreme environment applications.

Title: Strong Hilbert space fragmentation and fractons from subsystem and higher-form symmetries
Authors: Charles Stahl, Oliver Hart, Alexey Khudorozhkov, Rahul Nandkishore
Abstract: We introduce a new route to Hilbert space fragmentation in high dimensions leveraging the group-word formalism. We show that taking strongly fragmented models in one dimension and "lifting" to higher dimensions using subsystem symmetries can yield strongly fragmented dynamics in higher dimensions, with subdimensional (e.g., lineonic) excitations. This provides a new route to higher-dimensional strong fragmentation, and also a new route to fractonic behavior. Meanwhile, lifting one-dimensional strongly fragmented models to higher dimensions using higher-form symmetries yields models with topologically robust weak fragmentation. In three or more spatial dimensions, one can also "mix and match" subsystem and higher-form symmetries, leading to canonical fracton models such as X-cube. We speculate that this approach could also yield a new route to non-Abelian fractons. These constructions unify a number of phenomena that have been discussed in the literature, as well as furnishing models with novel properties.

Title: Gaplessness from disorder and quantum geometry in gapped superconductors
Authors: Omri Lesser, Sagnik Banerjee, Xuepeng Wang, Jaewon Kim, Ehud Altman, Debanjan Chowdhury
Abstract: It is well known that disorder can induce low-energy Andreev bound states in a sign-changing, but fully gapped, superconductor at $\pi-$junctions. Generically, these excitations are localized. Starting from a superconductor with a sign-changing and nodeless order parameter in the clean limit, here we demonstrate a mechanism for increasing the localization length associated with the low-energy Andreev bound states at a fixed disorder strength. We find that the Fubini-Study metric associated with the electronic Bloch wavefunctions controls the localization length and the hybridization between bound states localized at distinct $\pi-$junctions. We present results for the inverse participation ratio, superfluid stiffness, site-resolved and disorder-averaged spectral functions as a function of increasing Fubini-Study metric, which indicate an increased tendency towards delocalization. The low-energy properties resemble those of a dirty nodal superconductor with gapless Bogoliubov excitations. We place these results in the context of recent experiments in moire graphene superconductors.

Title: Activation of anomalous Hall effect and orbital magnetization by domain walls in altermagnets
Authors: Sopheak Sorn, Yuriy Mokrousov
Abstract: Altermagnets are an emerging class of unconventional antiferromagnets, characterized by a Néel ordering that does not break the translation symmetry of the underlying lattice. Depending on the orientation of the Néel vector, the anomalous Hall effect (AHE) may or may not exist. In the so-called pure altermagnets, AHE is forbidden by the magnetic symmetry. Here, we demonstrate that in pure altermagnets, the domain walls can lift the symmetry constraints, thereby activating the AHE and orbital magnetization. Taking a representative example of a rutile-lattice tight-binding minimal model in slab geometry, we use the linear response theory to demonstrate the emergence of the domain wall AHE, finding that it is closely related with the orbital magnetization, while the spin magnetization does not play a significant role. Using Landau theory, we argue that while for a random arrangement of $\pi$ domain walls, the contributions from the individual domain walls will cancel one another, an external magnetic field will favor domain-wall arrangements with specific chirality giving rise to a net AHE signal. Using group theory, we discuss how these findings can be generalized straightforwardly to certain other classes of altermagnets. Our work reveals a crucial role of the domain walls in the understanding of the Hall transport and orbital magnetism of altermagnets.

Title: Pairing mechanism and superconductivity in pressurized La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$
Authors: Ming Zhang, Cui-Qun Chen, Dao-Xin Yao, Fan Yang
Abstract: The discovery of superconductivity (SC) with critical temperature $T_c$ above the boiling point of liquid nitrogen in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$ has sparked a surge of exploration of high-$T_c$ superconductors in the Ruddlesden-Popper (RP) phase nickelates. More recently, the RP phase nicklate La$_5$Ni$_3$O$_{11}$, which hosts layered structure with alternating bilayer and single-layer NiO$_2$ planes, is reported to accommodate SC under pressure, exhibiting a dome-shaped pressure dependence with highest $T_c\approx 64$ K, capturing a lot of interests. Here, using density functional theory (DFT) and random phase approximation (RPA) calculations, we systematically study the electronic properties and superconducting mechanism of this material. Our DFT calculations yield a band structure including two nearly decoupled sets of sub-band structures, with one set originating from the bilayer subsystem and the other from the single-layer one. RPA-based analysis demonstrates that SC in this material occurs primarily within the bilayer subsystem exhibiting an $s^\pm$ wave pairing symmetry similar to that observed in pressurized La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_{7}$, while the single-layer subsystem mainly serves as a bridge facilitating the inter-bilayer phase coherence through the interlayer Josephson coupling (IJC). Since the IJC thus attained is extremely weak, it experiences a prominent enhancement under pressure, leading to the increase of the bulk $T_c$ with pressure initially. When the pressure is high enough, the $T_c$ gradually decreases due to the reduced density of states on the $\gamma$-pocket. In this way, the dome-shaped pressure dependence of $T_c$ observed experimentally is naturally understood.

Title: Phonon, Infrared and Raman Spectra of LiGa5O8 from Density Functional Perturbation Theory
Authors: Sarker Md. Sadman, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: LiGa$_5$O$_8$ with a cubic spinel type structure was recently reported to be a ultra-wide-band-gap semiconductor with unintentional p-type conduction. While the origin of p-type doping is still unclear, the fundamental properties of this material are of interest. Here we present a first-principles study of the phonons using density functional perturbation theory. The phonon band structures show no unstable modes verifying the stability of the structure. We focus mainly on the phonons at the Brillouin zone center for which a full symmetry analysis is presented. We present the dielectric function contributions from the infrared active modes as well as the Raman spectra and their polarization dependence. The phonon density of states integrated over the Brillouin zone is also presented as this may related to disordered Raman spectra.

Title: Self-heating electrochemical memory for high-precision analog computing

Bennett, William Wahby, Robin Jacobs-Gedrim, Matthew J. Marinella, Suhas Kumar, Sapan Agarwal, Yiyang Li, A. Alec Talin, Elliot J. Fuller
Abstract: Artificial intelligence (AI) is pushing the limits of digital computing to such an extent that, if current trends were to continue, global energy consumption from computation alone would eclipse all other forms of energy within the next two decades. One promising approach to reduce energy consumption and to increase computational speed is in-memory analog computing. However, analog computing necessitates a fundamental rethinking of computation at the material level, where information is stored as continuously variable physical observables. This shift introduces challenges related to the precision, dynamic range, and reliability of analog devices - issues that have hindered the development of existing memory technology for use in analog computers. Here, we address these issues in the context of memory which stores information as resistance. Our approach utilizes an electrochemical cell to tune the bulk oxygen-vacancy concentration within a metal oxide film. Through leveraging the gate contact as both a heater and source of electrochemical currents, kinetic barriers are overcome to enable a dynamic range of nine decades of analog tunable resistance, more than 3,000 available states, and programming with voltages less than 2 V. Furthermore, we demonstrate deterministic write operations with high precision, current-voltage linearity across six decades, and programming speeds as fast as 15 ns. These characteristics pave the way toward low-power analog computers with potential to improve AI efficiency by orders of magnitude.

Title: Generalized Rosenfeld-Tarazona scaling and high-density specific heat of simple liquids
Authors: S. Khrapak, A. Khrapak
Abstract: The original Rosenfeld-Tarazona (RT) scaling of the excess energy in simple dense fluids predicts a $\propto T^{3/5}$ thermal correction to the fluid Madelung energy. This implies that the excess isochoric heat capacity scales as $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-2/5}$. Careful examination performed in this paper demonstrates that the exponent $-2/5$ is not always optimal. For instance, in the Lennard-Jones fluid in some vicinity of the triple point, the exponent $-1/3$ turns out to be more appropriate. The analysis of the specific heat data in neon, argon, krypton, xenon, and liquid mercury reveals that no single value of the exponent exists, describing all the data simultaneously. Therefore we propose a generalized RT scaling in the form $C_{\rm v}^{\rm ex}\propto T^{-\alpha}$, where $\alpha$ is a density- and material-dependent adjustable parameter. The question concerning which material properties and parameters affect the exponent $\alpha$ and whether it can be predicted from general physical arguments requires further investigation.

Title: Interpretation of run-and-tumble motion as jump-process: the case of a harmonic trap
Authors: Derek Frydel
Abstract: By mapping run-and-tumble motion onto jump-process (a process in which a particle, instead of moving continuously in time, performs consequential jumps), a system in a steady-state can be formulated as an integral equation. The key ingredient of this formulation is the transition operator $G(x,x')$, representing the probability distribution of jumps along the $x$-axis for a particle located at $x'$ before a jump. For particles in a harmonic trap, exact expressions for $G(x,x')$ are obtained and, in principle, $G(x,x')$ has all the information about a stationary distribution $\rho(x)$. One way to extract $\rho$ is to use the condition of stationarity, $\rho(x) = \int dx' \, \rho(x') G(x,x')$, resulting in an integral equation formulation of the problem. For the system in dimension $d=2$, there is an unexpected reduction of complexity; the expression for $G(x,x')$ is found to be reversible, which implies that $\rho(x)$ (within the jump-process interpretation) obeys the detailed balance condition, and $\rho$ can be obtained from the detailed balance relation, $\rho(x') G(x,x') = \rho(x) G(x',x)$.

Title: Electronic mobility, doping, and defects in epitaxial $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ chalcogenide perovskite thin films
Authors: Jack Van Sambeek, Jessica Dong, Anton V. Ievlev, Tao Cai, Ida Sadeghi, Rafael Jaramillo
Abstract: We present the electronic transport properties of $\mathrm{BaZrS_3}$ (BZS) thin films grown epitaxially by gas-source molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). We observe n-type behavior in all samples, with carrier concentration ranging from $4 \times 10^{18}$ to $4 \times 10^{20} \mathrm{cm^{-3}}$ at room temperature (RT). We observe a champion RT Hall mobility of 11.1 $\mathrm{cm^2V^{-1}s^{-1}}$, which is competitive with established thin-film photovoltaic (PV) absorbers. Temperature-dependent Hall mobility data show that phonon scattering dominates at room temperature, in agreement with computational predictions. X-ray diffraction data illustrate a correlation between mobility and stacking fault concentration, illustrating how microstructure can affect transport. Despite the well-established environmental stability of chalcogenide perovskites, we observe significant changes to electronic properties as a function of storage time in ambient conditions. With the help of secondary-ion mass-spectrometry (SIMS) measurements, we propose and support a defect mechanism that explains this behavior: as-grown films have a high concentration of sulfur vacancies that are shallow donors ($\mathrm{V_S^\bullet}$ or $\mathrm{V_S^{\bullet \bullet}}$), which are converted into neutral oxygen defects ($\mathrm{O_S^\times}$) upon air exposure. We discuss the relevance of this defect mechanism within the larger context of chalcogenide perovskite research, and we identify means to stabilize the electronic properties.

Title: Holstein mechanism in single-site model with unitary evolution
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: We consider the Holstein mechanism in single electron (one-site) system with unitary evolution that is intrinsic to both the fermion and boson operators in the case of nonadiabatic limit. The unitary dynamics as well as boson-frequency-dependence provide the evidence of quantum phase transition from the distinct behaviors at short-time and long-time stages, which exhibit power law and exponential law decay, respectively, as can be seem from the polaronic shift.

Title: Distribution of antiferromagnetic rare-earth domains in multiferroic Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$
Authors: Yannik Zemp, Ehsan Hassanpour, Jan Gerrit Horstmann, Yusuke Tokunaga, Yasujiro Taguchi, Yoshinori Tokura, Thomas Lottermoser, Mads C. Weber, Manfred Fiebig
Abstract: In many multiferroics, rare-earth and transition-metal orders exist side by side. For analyzing their interaction and its consequences for the multiferroic state, the associated domain patterns and their spatial correlation can give valuable insight. Unfortunately, this is often hampered by the lack of access to the domains of the rare-earth order. Here, we uncover such a domain pattern for the antiferromagnetic and multiferroic Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$. Optical second harmonic generation reveals the formation of column-like Dy/Tb domains. Interestingly, the columns form perpendicular to the magnetically induced electric polarization. Hence, the antiferromagnetic rare-earth order forces the ferroelectric domains to form nominally charged head-to-head and tail-to-tail domain walls, thus playing a leading role in the domain formation within the multiferroic phase. In turn, to reduce energy cost, the ferroelectric order causes a reduced rare-earth domain-wall density along the direction of the electric polarization. This interplay highlights the multiferroic character of the Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ domain pattern. We position Dy$_{0.7}$Tb$_{0.3}$FeO$_3$ within the broader landscape of rare-earth multiferroics and identify three distinct scenarios for the role of rare-earth order in these.

Title: Inchworm Tensor Train Hybridization Expansion Quantum Impurity Solver
Authors: Yang Yu, André Erpenbeck, Dominika Zgid, Guy Cohen, Olivier Parcollet, Emanuel Gull
Abstract: The investigation of quantum impurity models plays a crucial role in condensed matter physics because of their wide-ranging applications, such as embedding theories and transport problems. Traditional methods often fall short of producing accurate results for multi-orbital systems with complex interactions and off-diagonal hybridizations. Recently, tensor-train-based integration and summation techniques have shown promise as effective alternatives. In this study, we use tensor train methods to tackle quantum impurity problems formulated within the imaginary-time inchworm hybridization expansion framework. We identify key challenges in the inchworm expansion itself and its interplay with tensor-train-based methods. We demonstrate the accuracy and versatility of our approach by solving general quantum impurity problems. Our results suggest that tensor-train decomposition schemes offer a viable path toward accurate and efficient multi-orbital impurity solvers.

Title: Geometric Frustration in Twist-Bend Nematic Droplets
Authors: Joseph Pollard, Richard G. Morris
Abstract: Liquid crystals formed of bent-core molecules are exotic materials that exhibit the twist-bend nematic phase. This arises when an energetic preference for nonzero local bend distortion is accommodated via twist in the texture, resulting in properties synonymous with both smectics and cholesterics. Here we describe how the frustration inherent to the twist-bend phase can be exacerbated by confinement and boundary anchoring. Using a combination of numerical simulations, topological and geometric analysis, we catalogue the equilibrium textures that arise in spherical twist-bend droplets with a radial anchoring as the two key parameters -- the molecular cone angle and the ratio between the pitch length and droplet radius -- are varied. This form of confinement is known to produce a wide variety of topologically and geometrically complex metastable states in cholesterics. We find that twist-bend nematic droplets are no different, exhibiting a variety of complex layered states, defect constellations, and Hopfions. However, whilst many of the structures and defect configurations that we observe are equivalent to their cholesteric counterparts, they are geometrically very distinct, in part due to the absence of chirality.

Title: Exact Expansion Formalism for Transport Properties of Heterogeneous Materials Characterized by Arbitrary Continuous Random Fields
Authors: Liyu Zhong, Yang Jiao, Sheng Mao
Abstract: We derive an exact contrast-expansion formalism for the effective conductivity of heterogeneous materials (media) with local properties described by arbitrary continuous random fields, significantly generalizing the widely used binary-field models. The theory produces a rapidly convergent Neumann-series that, upon Gaussian closure via a Hermite expansion, yields closed-form first-, second- and third-order approximations, which achieve percent-level accuracy at first order for isotropic media. For anisotropic media, second-order approximations achieve sub-2% accuracy across a wide range of local property contrasts and correlations. Our formalism provides mathematically rigorous structure-property closures, with significant implications for the discovery and design of novel graded and architected materials with tailored transport properties.

Title: Ultrafast charge-transfer dynamics in Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ from time-resolved optical reflectivity
Authors: Haiyun Huang, Xiu Zhang, Junzhi Zhu, Jianfa Zhao, Lin Zhao, Yu-Xia Duan, Jian-Qiao Meng, X. J. Zhou, Changqing Jin, Haiyun Liu
Abstract: We employ time-resolved optical reflectivity to investigate the ultrafast dynamics of the charge-transfer gap (CTG) in a parent cuprate compound Ca$_2$CuO$_2$Cl$_2$ (CCOC). We observe a persistent photoinduced red shift of the CTG that lasts up to 1000 ps. The red shift during the slow decay after 10 ps can be well modeled by the localized picture, whereas its maximum value at ~0.9 ps involves additional contribution from the renormalization of the Hubbard U due to screening effect from delocalized electrons. Furthermore, coupling between the mid-gap absorption and a slow acoustic phonon launches coherent oscillations below the CTG, observed as a ~20 GHz modulation with a dispersion independent of the pump fluence. These results demonstrate the tunning of the CTG by light, unveil complex interplay between multiple degrees of freedom, and contribute to a deeper understanding of superconductivity and correlated materials.

Title: Pure nematic transition inside the superconducting dome of iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$
Authors: K. Y. Liang, R .Z. Zhang, Z. F. Lin, Z. J. Li, B. R. Chen, P. H. Zhang, K. Z. Yao, Q. S. He, Q. Z. Zhou, H. X. Yao, K. Jin, Y. H. Wang
Abstract: Nematicity and magnetism are prevalent orders in high transition temperature (Tc) superconductors, coexisting in the parent compound of most material families. Quantum fluctuations of nematicity or spin orders are both plausible candidates for mediating unconventional Cooper pairing. Identifying the sole effect of a nematic quantum critical point (QCP) on the emergence of superconducting dome without interference of spin fluctuations is therefore highly desirable. The iron chalcogenide superconductor FeSe exhibits pure nematicity without any magnetic ordering. A nematic quantum phase transition can be induced by Te substitution but experimental study of such transition is so far limited to its normal state. By performing local susceptometry on composition-spread FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$ films ($0 < x < 1$) using scanning Superconducting Quantum Interference Device (sSQUID) microscopy, we investigate the superfluid density ($\rho_s$) across the pure nematic transition in extremely fine steps of ${\Delta}x$ = 0.0008. The temperature dependence of $\rho_s$ changes from the form of anisotropic pairing on the nematic side to an isotropic one across the critical doping $x_c$. The power-law dependence of gap anisotropy on $|x - x_c|$ provides evidence for nematic quantum criticality under the superconducting dome. The low-temperature $\rho_s$ scales linearly with Tc in the nematic phase $x < x_c$, whereas the gap amplitude, maximized at $x_c$, determines the Tc for $x>x_c$. Our results establish a pure nematic QCP in FeSe$_{1-x}$Te$_x$, separating two superconducting orders with distinct pairing boosted by nematic quantum fluctuations.

Title: Pressure evolution of coplanar antiferromagnetism in heavy-fermion Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$
Authors: M. O. Ajeesh, A. O. Scheie, Yu Liu, L. Keller, S. M. Thomas, P. F. S. Rosa, E. D. Bauer
Abstract: Ce$_{2}$$M$Al$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ ($M=$ Co, Ir, Ni or Pd) are heavy-fermion materials and host a variety of ground states ranging from magnetism to non-Fermi liquid behavior. The Co, Ir, and Ni members of the series undergo magnetic ordering with decreasing transition temperatures. In contrast, the Pd compound does not magnetically order down to 0.4 K and shows non-Fermi liquid behavior, suggesting proximity to a magnetic quantum critical point. Among the series, Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ orders antiferromagnetically below $T_N=1.9$ K along with heavy-fermion behavior below 15 K. We report the magnetic structure of the antiferromagnetic phase in Ce$_{2}$CoAl$_{7}$Ge$_{4}$ and the evolution of the magnetic transition under external pressure. Rietveld refinement of the neutron diffraction data suggests a coplanar antiferromagnetic structure with a wave vector $k = (1,1,1)$ and an ordered moment of $0.383 \pm 0.018 \> \mu_B$ in the antiferromagnetic phase. Electrical resistivity and AC calorimetry measurements under hydrostatic pressure reveal a suppression of the antiferromagnetic transition toward zero temperature around $p=1.1$ GPa. However, there is no evidence of non-Fermi liquid behavior associated with the suppression of magnetism by pressure, unlike the effect of transition-metal substitution.

Title: Finite temperatures and flat bands: the Hubbard model on three-dimensional Lieb lattices
Authors: Lucas O. Lima, Julián Faúndez, Natanael C. Costa, Raimundo R. dos Santos
Abstract: We investigate some thermodynamic and magnetic properties of the Hubbard model on two three-dimensional extensions of the Lieb lattice: the perovskite Lieb lattice (PLL) and the layered Lieb lattice (LLL). Using determinant quantum Monte Carlo (DQMC) simulations alongside Hartree-Fock and cluster mean-field theory (CMFT) approaches, we analyze how flat-band degeneracy, connectivity, and lattice anisotropy influence the emergence of magnetic order. Our results show that both geometries support finite-temperature magnetic transitions, namely ferromagnetic (FM) on the PLL, and antiferromagnetic (AFM) on the LLL. Further, we have established that the critical temperature, $T_c$, as a function of the uniform on-site coupling, $U$, displays a maximum, which is smaller in the AFM case than in the FM one, despite the absence of flat bands in the LLL. We also provide numerical evidence to show that flat bands in the PLL rapidly generate magnetic moments, but a small interorbital coordination suppresses the increase of $T_c$ at large interaction strength $U/t$. By contrast, the LLL benefits from higher connectivity, favoring magnetic order even in the absence of flat bands. The possibilities of anisotropic interlayer hoppings and inhomogeneous on-site interactions were separateley explored. We have found that magnetism in the PLL is hardly affected by hopping anisotropy, since the main driving mechanism is the preserved flat band; for the LLL, by contrast, spectral weight is removed from $d$-sites, which increases $T_c$ more significantly. At mean-field level, we have obtained that setting $U=0$ on $p$ sites and $U=U_d\neq0$ on $d$ sites leads to a quantum critical point at some $U_d$; this behavior was not confirmed by our DQMC simulations.

Title: Magnetic Charge State Controlled Spin-Wave Dynamics in Nanoscale Three-Dimensional Artificial Spin Ice
Authors: Chandan Kumar, Amrit Kumar Mondal, Sreya Pal, Sayan Mathur, Jay R. Scott, Arjen van Den Berg, Adekunle O. Adeyeye, Sam Ladak, Anjan Barman
Abstract: Three-dimensional (3D) magnetic nanostructures offer a versatile platform for exploring complex spin textures and spin-wave (SW) dynamics, with implications in next-generation spintronic and magnonic technologies. Advances in 3D nanofabrication have allowed a wide-range of structures and phenomena to be realized. Whilst the study of simple cylindrical magnetic nanowires allows the realization of ultrafast domain walls and a spin Cherenkov effect, placing such wires of complex cross-section into 3D arrangements allows one to produce magnetic metamaterials, known as artificial spin-ice (ASI), where the overall ground state and spin dynamics are governed by magnetostatic interactions between elements. Here, using Brillouin Light Scattering (BLS) we demonstrate the direct detection of magnetic charged states in a 3D-ASI system. The measured spin-wave modes in 3D-ASI are found to be directly controlled by the local magnetic charge configuration and the direction of the applied magnetic field. Micromagnetic simulations provide insight into the spatially selective excitation of spin waves and the evolution of magnetic microstates, uncovering a direct link to the field-dependent characteristics of the spin-wave spectrum. These findings make 3D-ASI architectures a promising system to realize reconfigurable, low-power magnonic devices with engineered collective dynamics.

Title: Statistical properties of non-linear observables of fractal Gaussian fields with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on composite operators
Authors: Cecile Monthus
Abstract: The statistical properties of non-linear observables of the fractal Gaussian field $\phi(\vec x)$ of negative Hurst exponent $H<0$ in dimension $d$ are revisited with a focus on spatial-averaging observables and on the properties of the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $. For the special case $n=2$ of quadratic observables, explicit results include the cumulants of arbitrary order, the Lévy-Khintchine formula for the characteristic function and the anomalous large deviations properties. The case of observables of arbitrary order $n>2$ is analyzed via the Wiener-Ito chaos-expansion for functionals of the white noise: the multiple stochastic Ito integrals are useful to identify the finite parts $\phi_n(\vec x)$ of the ill-defined composite operators $\phi^n(\vec x) $ and to compute their correlations involving the Hurst exponents $H_n=nH$.

Title: Diffraction Stress Factors Calculated Using a Maximum Entropy Method
Authors: Maximilian Krause, Nicola Simon, Claudius Klein, Jens Gibmeier, Thomas Böhlke
Abstract: Diffraction-based stress analysis of textured materials depends on understanding their elastic heterogeneity and its influence on microscopic strain distributions, which is generally done by using simplifying assumptions for crystallite interactions to calculate tensorial stress factors or in the case of very strong textures, by considering the material phase as a single crystal (crystallite group method). In this paper, we apply the micromechanical Maximum Entropy Method (MEM) to this purpose, which marks its first use for materials with texture. The special feature of this approach is a native parametrization by the effective stiffness of the material, which allows the approach to be tailored to a macroscopically measurable sample property. We perform example stress analyses of cold-rolled copper, finding through validation with full-field simulations that the MEM yields accurate local strains even for materials with extremely sharp textures. In an example stress analysis of mildly textured cold-rolled ferritic steel, the accuracy of the approach compares favorably to the established Voigt, Reuss and self-consistent Eshelby-Kröner approaches. Compared to the latter, the method is also numerically efficient to calculate.

Title: Materials Generation in the Era of Artificial Intelligence: A Comprehensive Survey
Authors: Zhixun Li, Bin Cao, Rui Jiao, Liang Wang, Ding Wang, Yang Liu, Dingshuo Chen, Jia Li, Qiang Liu, Yu Rong, Liang Wang, Tong-yi Zhang, Jeffrey Xu Yu
Abstract: Materials are the foundation of modern society, underpinning advancements in energy, electronics, healthcare, transportation, and infrastructure. The ability to discover and design new materials with tailored properties is critical to solving some of the most pressing global challenges. In recent years, the growing availability of high-quality materials data combined with rapid advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) has opened new opportunities for accelerating materials discovery. Data-driven generative models provide a powerful tool for materials design by directly create novel materials that satisfy predefined property requirements. Despite the proliferation of related work, there remains a notable lack of up-to-date and systematic surveys in this area. To fill this gap, this paper provides a comprehensive overview of recent progress in AI-driven materials generation. We first organize various types of materials and illustrate multiple representations of crystalline materials. We then provide a detailed summary and taxonomy of current AI-driven materials generation approaches. Furthermore, we discuss the common evaluation metrics and summarize open-source codes and benchmark datasets. Finally, we conclude with potential future directions and challenges in this fast-growing field. The related sources can be found at this https URL.

Title: Electronic and Vibrational Properties of Layered Boron Nitride Polymorphs
Authors: Priyanka Mishra, Nevill Gonzalez Szwacki
Abstract: We present a comprehensive first-principles investigation of the structural, electronic, and vibrational properties of four layered boron nitride (BN) polymorphs--AA-stacked ($e$-BN), AA$^\prime$-stacked ($h$-BN), ABC-stacked ($r$-BN), and AB-stacked ($b$-BN). Using density functional theory and density functional perturbation theory with and without van der Waals (vdW) corrections, we quantify the impact of interlayer dispersion on lattice parameters, electronic band gaps, phonon frequencies, and infrared and Raman intensities. Our results demonstrate that vdW interactions are essential for reproducing experimental lattice constants and stabilizing interlayer phonon modes. The vibrational spectra exhibit distinct stacking-dependent features, enabling clear differentiation among polytypes. Notably, $b$-BN displays a direct band gap, while $r$-BN shows enhanced IR and Raman activity due to LO-TO splitting and symmetry breaking. These findings underscore the critical role of interlayer interactions in determining the physical properties of $sp^2$-bonded BN and offer insight into the experimental identification and functionalization of BN polytypes for electronic and photonic applications.

Title: High-pressure high-temperature solution growth, structural, and superconducting properties of Fe-substituted MgB2 single crystals
Authors: N.D. Zhigadlo, R. Puzniak
Abstract: Clarifying the impact of Fe doping on the structural and superconducting properties of MgB2 is crucial, considering that iron is commonly used as a sheath material for the fabrication of metal-clad MgB2 wires and tapes. To date the effects of Fe doping have only been investigated in polycrystalline samples, but the obtained results are controversial. Here, we report the successful growth of Mg1-xFexB2 single crystals in a quaternary Mg-Fe-B-N system using the cubic anvil high-pressure and high-temperature technique. The reaction took place in a closed boron nitride crucible at a pressure of 3 GPa and a temperature of 1960 °C. The grown crystals exhibit plate-like shapes with sizes up to 0.9 x 0.7 x 0.1 mm3. The variation of the critical temperature Tc of Mg1-xFexB2 crystals with Fe content was found to be different from that observed in polycrystalline samples. For a small Fe doping, up to x < 0.03, the behaviour of Tc(x) is similar to that for the crystals with Al and C substitutions, which suggests that Fe is in non-magnetic state. In this doping range, measurements of the temperature-dependent magnetization performed in high magnetic fields exclude spin states other than S = 0 for the Fe ions. However, for x > 0.03, certain crystals start to show a dramatic decrease in Tc, suggesting that Fe might be in a magnetic state. The M-H dependence for these crystals shows significant increase of magnetization with increasing field in low magnetic field, pointing to a weak ferromagnetism. Overall, the availability of Fe substituted MgB2 single crystals exhibiting such peculiar behaviour offers a unique opportunity to investigate the effect of disorder alone on one hand and the influence of magnetic substituent on the superconducting characteristics on the other.

Title: The Solution of the Critical Dynamics of the Mean-Field Kob-Andersen Model
Authors: Gianmarco Perrupato, Tommaso Rizzo
Abstract: We analytically solve the critical dynamics of the Kob-Andersen kinetically constrained model of supercooled liquids on the Bethe lattice, employing a combinatorial argument based on the cavity method. For arbitrary values of graph connectivity z and facilitation parameter m, we demonstrate that the critical behavior of the order parameter is governed by equations of motion equivalent to those found in Mode-Coupling Theory. The resulting predictions for the dynamical exponents are validated through direct comparisons with numerical simulations that include both continuous and discontinuous transition scenarios.

Title: Clogging-unclogging transition in 2D vertical pipe
Authors: Y. Zhou, M. Li, Y. Wang, Y. Guan, Y. Liu, Z. Zou
Abstract: We experimentally and numerically investigate the clogging behavior of granular materials in a two-dimensional vertical pipe. The nonmonotonicity of clogging probability found in cylindrical vertical pipe is also observed in the two-dimensional case. We numerically demonstrate that the clogging probability strongly correlates with the friction coefficient $\mu$, in addition to the pipe-to-particle diameter ratio $D/d$. We thus construct a clogging-unclogging $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram within the $2<D/d<3$ range. Finally, by analyzing the geometrical arrangements of particles and using a simple analysis of forces and torques, we are able to predict the clogging-unclogging transition in the $D/d$-$\mu$ phase diagram and explain the mechanism of the observed counterintuitive nonmonotonicity in more detail. From this work, we identify two primary conditions for clogging formation: first, all particles must achieve force and torque equilibrium; second, they must geometrically form an arch. Our theoretical analysis reveals that the clogging-unclogging transition in vertical pipe is a natural example of the shear jamming transition.

Title: Role of Translational Noise in Motility-Induced Phase Separation of Hard Active Particles
Authors: Felipe Hawthorne, Pablo de Castro, José A. Freire
Abstract: Self-propelled particles, like motile cells and artificial colloids, can spontaneously form macroscopic clusters. This phenomenon is called motility-induced phase separation (MIPS) and occurs even without attractive forces, provided that the self-propulsion direction fluctuates slowly. In addition to rotational noise, these particles may experience translational noise, not coupled to rotational noise, due to environmental fluctuations. We study the role of translational noise in the clustering of active Brownian hard disks. To tease apart the contribution of translational noise, we model excluded-volume interactions through a Monte-Carlo-like overlap rejection approach. Upon increasing the translational diffusivity, we find that clusters become more rounded (less fractal), eventually transitioning to genuine MIPS. For sufficiently higher translational diffusivity, clusters melt down. We develop a theory for the cluster mass distribution, and employ a hydrodynamic approach with parameters taken from the simulation, that explains the clustering phase diagram.

Title: Kinetically controlling surface atom arrangements in thermally robust, amorphous high-entropy alloy nanoparticles by solvent selection
Authors: Varatharaja Nallathambi, Se-Ho Kim, Baptiste Gault, Sven Reichenberger, Dierk Raabe, Stephan Barcikowski
Abstract: The ability to tailor nanoscale surface atom arrangements through multi-elemental compositional control provides high-entropy nanoalloys with promising functional properties. Developing a fundamental understanding of nanoalloy formation mechanisms during synthesis is therefore essential for effectively engineering the surface composition and resulting functional properties. Using the Cantor alloy (CrMnFeCoNi) as a model system, we investigate how solvent selection during reactive, nanosecond-pulsed laser synthesis influences carbon doping and the resulting changes in nanoparticle morphology, structure, and composition. Supersaturated carbon incorporation, partitioned from the organic solvent molecules, produces amorphous nanoparticles with distinctive carbon shells, thermally stable up to 350 °C. We propose kinetically controlled particle formation mechanisms and rationalize the criticality of the time scales between the competing reactions of carbon doping, carbon shell formation, and coalescence of metallic fragments, ruling compositional and morphological characteristics. This work demonstrates effective solvent-driven surface-compositional control in amorphous high-entropy nanoalloys. It introduces a novel synthesis approach for tailoring surface atom arrangements through carbon incorporation via reactive, pulsed laser synthesis.

Title: Phonon-limited carrier transport in the Weyl semimetal TaAs
Authors: Zhe Liu, Shashi B. Mishra, Jae-Mo Lihm, Samuel Poncé, Elena R. Margine
Abstract: Topological Weyl semimetals represent a novel class of quantum materials that exhibit remarkable properties arising from their unique electronic structure. In this work, we employ state-of-the-art ab initio methods to investigate the role of the electron-phonon interactions on the charge transport properties of TaAs. Our calculations of the temperature-dependent electrical conductivity with the iterative Boltzmann transport equation show excellent agreement with experimental measurements above 100 K. Extending the analysis to doped systems, we demonstrate that even small shifts in the Fermi level can lead to substantial changes in conductivity, driven by the complex topology of the Fermi surface. In particular, modifications in Fermi surface nesting emerge as a key factor influencing scattering processes and carrier lifetimes. These findings offer critical insights into the microscopic mechanisms that govern transport in TaAs and highlight the sensitivity of Weyl semimetals to doping and carrier dynamics.

Title: Comment on "Shell-Shaped Quantum Droplet in a Three-Component Ultracold Bose Gas"
Authors: Francesco Ancilotto
Abstract: In a recent paper (Y. Ma and X. Cui, Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 043402 (2025)), a new type of shell-shaped Bose-Einstein condensate with a self-bound character has been proposed, made of three-component $Na^{23}K^{39}K^{41}$ Bose mixture (species (1,2,3) in the following), where the mixtures (1, 2) and (2, 3) both form quantum droplets. The proposed structures are made of an outer shell of liquid (1,2) enveloping a spherical core of (2,3) liquid, which is claimed to be stable without the need of any trapping potential. I comment in the following that these structures are not actually the ground-states solutions to the system but rather local energy minima, and most likely impossible to realize in practice.

Title: Orbital-resolved anisotropic electron pockets in electron-doped SrTiO3 observed by ARPES
Authors: Yuki K. Wakabayashi, Akihira Munakata, Yoshitaka Taniyasu, Masaki Kobayashi
Abstract: SrTiO3 has attracted considerable interest as a wide-band gap semiconductor for advanced high-k capacitors and photocatalytic applications. Although previous angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) studies have characterized the valence band structure originating from O 2p orbitals, the conduction band arising from Ti 3d orbitals upon electron doping, which is called electron pockets, remain poorly understood. In this study, polarization-dependent ARPES measurements were performed on Nb 1%-doped SrTiO3 (001), enabling direct, orbital-selective visualization of the electron pockets. From the measured band dispersion, we quantitatively determined their effective masses, anisotropy, and electron density. Our results revealed formation of an electron pocket at the Gamma point induced by Nb doping, yielding a direct bandgap of 3.79 eV at Gamma, consistent with previous optical measurements. Furthermore, the effective masses of m1 = 0.63m0 (short-axis direction) and m2 = 8.0m0 (long-axis direction) were identified, where m0 is the free electron mass, and the Fermi surface has been shown to be ellipsoidal. The electron density derived from these dispersions was found to be 3.58e20 cm-3. These findings provide a comprehensive picture of the conduction-band electronic structure that will be crucial in the design of STO-based functional devices.

Title: Silver Electrodeposition from Ag/AgCl Electrodes: Implications for Nanoscience
Authors: Chuhongxu Chen, Ziwei Wang, Guilin Chen, Zhijia Zhang, Zakhar Bedran, Stephen Tipper, Pablo Dıaz-Nunez, Ivan Timokhin, Artem Mishchenko, Qian Yang
Abstract: With the advancement of nanoscience, silver/silver chloride (Ag/AgCl) electrodes have become widely utilised in microscale and nanoscale fluidic experiments, because of their stability. However, our findings reveal that the dissolution of AgCl from the electrode in \ch{Cl-}-rich solutions can lead to significant silver contamination, through the formation of silver complexes, \ch{[AgCl_{n+1}]^{n-}}. We demonstrate the electrodeposition of silver particles on graphene in KCl aqueous solution, with AgCl dissolution from the electrode as the sole source of silver. This unexpected electrodeposition process offers a more plausible interpretation of the recently reported ``ionic flow-induced current in graphene''. That is, the measured electronic current in graphene is due to the electrodeposition of silver, challenging the previously claimed ``ionic Coulomb drag''. More caution is called for when using Ag/AgCl electrodes in microfluidic, and especially nanofluidic systems, because AgCl dissolution should not be neglected.

Title: Major issues in theory of Bose-Einstein condensation
Authors: V.I. Yukalov
Abstract: Major issues arising in the theory of Bose-Einstein condensation are reviewed. These issues, although being principally important, are very often misunderstood, which results in wrong conclusions. The basic point is global gauge symmetry breaking that is a necessary and sufficient condition for Bose-Einstein condensation. Paying no attention to this basic point is a common fallacy leading to a number of confusions. For instance, the attempt of describing Bose condensation without gauge symmetry breaking produces the so-called ``grand canonical catastrophe" that actually does not exist in the correct description of Bose condensation accompanied by gauge symmetry breaking. The other common flaw is forgetting to consider the stability of the studied systems. One sometimes accomplishes lengthy calculations and discusses the properties of a system that in reality cannot exist being unstable. In some cases, the seeming instability is caused by the negligence of the simple mathematical reason teaching us that one should not go beyond the approximation applicability. An example of such an artificial instability is related to the appearance of the so-called ``thermodynamically anomalous fluctuations" whose arising is due to the use of a second-order approximation for calculating fourth-order terms, in this way distorting the $O(2)$-class model of a Bose-condensed system to the Gaussian-class model. These and other principal points, important for the correct treatment of Bose-condensed systems, are reviewed, including the resolution of the Hohenberg-Martin dilemma of gapless versus conserving theories for Bose-condensed systems and the problem of statistical ensemble equivalence.

Title: Fast and high-fidelity transfer of edge states via dynamical control of topological phases and effects of dissipation
Authors: Yuuki Kanda, Yusuke Fujisawa, Kousuke Yakubo, Norio Kawakami, Hideaki Obuse
Abstract: Topological edge states are robust against symmetry-preserving perturbations and noise, making them promising for quantum information and computation, particularly in topological quantum computation through braiding operations of Majorana quasiparticles. Realizing these applications requires fast and high-fidelity dynamic control of edge states. In this work, we theoretically propose a high-fidelity method for transferring one-dimensional topological edge states by dynamically moving a domain wall between regions of different topological numbers. This method fundamentally relies on Lorentz invariance and relativistic effects, as moving the domain wall at a constant speed results in the problem into the uniform linear motion of a particle obeying a Dirac equation. We demonstrate effectiveness of our method in transferring edge states with high fidelity using a one-dimensional quantum walk with two internal states, which is feasible with current experimental technology. We also investigate how bit and phase-flip dissipation from environment affects transfer efficiency. Remarkably, these dissipation have minimal effects on efficiency at slow and fast transfer limits, respectively, which can be explained by relativistic effects to the edge states.

Title: Exploring magneto-electric coupling through lattice distortions: insights from a pantograph model
Authors: Daniel C. Cabra, Gerardo L. Rossini
Abstract: Multiferroic materials exhibit the coexistence of magnetic and electric order. They are at the forefront of modern condensed matter physics due to their potential applications in next-generation technologies such as data storage, sensors, and actuators. Despite significant progress, understanding and optimizing the coupling mechanisms between electric polarization and magnetism remain active areas of research. We review here a series of papers presenting a comprehensive numerical and theoretical exploration of a pantograph mechanism modeling magneto-electric coupling through lattice distortions in low dimensional multiferroic systems. These works introduce and elaborate a microscopic model where elastic lattice distortions mediate interactions between spin 1/2 magnetic moments and electric dipoles, uncovering novel physics and functionalities. The model successfully describes ubiquitous phenomena in type II improper multiferroics, particularly when dominant Ising spin components are introduced through XXZ-type rotational symmetry breaking spin interactions. We also study more realistic extensions relevant for materials with higher spin magnetic ions and to materials where magnetic couplings draw higher dimensional lattices.

Title: To reset or not to reset in a finite domain: that is the question
Authors: Gregorio García-Valladares, Antonio Prados, Alessandro Manacorda, Carlos A. Plata
Abstract: We investigate the search of a target with a given spatial distribution in a finite one-dimensional domain. The searcher follows Brownian dynamics and is always reset to its initial position when reaching the boundaries of the domain (boundary resetting). In addition, the searcher may be reset to its initial position from any internal point of the domain (bulk resetting). Specifically, we look for the optimal strategy for bulk resetting, i.e., the spatially dependent bulk resetting rate that minimizes the average search time. The best search strategy exhibits a second-order transition from vanishing to non-vanishing bulk resetting when varying the target distribution. The obtained mathematical criteria are further analyzed for a monoparametric family of distributions, to shed light on the properties that control the optimal strategy for bulk resetting. Our work paves new research lines in the study of search processes, emphasizing the relevance of the target distribution for the optimal search strategy, and identifies a successful framework to address these questions.

Title: Tailored Vapor Deposition Unlocks Large-Grain, Wafer-Scale Epitaxial Growth of 2D Magnetic CrCl3
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Abhishek Jangid, Manas Sharma, Manvi Verma, Jampala Pasyanthi, Keerthana S Kumar, Piyush Sharma, Emil O. Chiglintsev, Mikhail I. Panin, Sudeep N. Punnathanam, Alexander I. Chernov, Ananth Govind Rajan, Akshay Singh
Abstract: Two-dimensional magnetic materials (2D-MM) are an exciting playground for fundamental research, and for spintronics and quantum sensing. However, their large-grain large-area synthesis using scalable vapour deposition methods is still an unsolved challenge. Here, we develop a tailored approach for centimetre-scale growth of semiconducting 2D-MM CrCl3 films on mica substrate, via physical vapour transport deposition. A controlled synthesis protocol, enabled via innovations concerning light management, very-high carrier-gas flow, precursor flux, and oxygen/moisture removal, is critical for wafer-scale growth. Optical, stoichiometric, structural, and magnetic characterization identify crystalline, phase-pure 2D-MM CrCl3. Substrate temperature tunes thickness of films from few-layers to tens of nanometres. Further, selective-area growth and large-area transfer are demonstrated. Substrate-dependent growth features are explained by density functional theory and state-of-the-art machine learning interatomic potential-based atomic-scale simulations. This scalable vapour deposition approach can be applied for growth of several 2D-MM, and low growth temperature (~500 C) will enable creation of hybrid heterostructures.

Title: Very persistent random walkers reveal transitions in landscape topology
Authors: Jaron Kent-Dobias
Abstract: We study the typical behavior of random walkers on the microcanonical configuration space of mean-field disordered systems. Passive walks have an ergodicity-breaking transition at precisely the energy density associated with the dynamical glass transition, but persistent walks remain ergodic at lower energies. In models where the energy landscape is thoroughly understood, we show that, in the limit of infinite persistence time, the ergodicity-breaking transition coincides with a transition in the topology of microcanonical configuration space. We conjecture that this correspondence generalizes to other models, and use it to determine the topological transition energy in situations where the landscape properties are ambiguous.

Title: Effect of spark plasma sintering on the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide
Authors: Mohammad Azam, Tatiana Zajarniuk, Konrad Kwatek, Paolo Mele, Shiv J. Singh
Abstract: We optimize the superconducting properties of Sm-based oxypnictide (Sm1111: SmFeAsO0.80F0.20) by using the Spark Plasma Sintering (SPS) technique under various synthesis conditions, including heating temperatures ranging from 600 to 1000 °C for durations of 5 to 30 minutes at the applied pressure of 45 MPa. All prepared bulks are characterized by structural and microstructural analysis as well as transport and magnetic measurements to conclude our findings. SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 bulks are also prepared using the conventional synthesis process at ambient pressure (CSP) and the high gas pressure and high temperature (HP-HTS) methods at 500 MPa, which exhibit a superconducting transition temperature (Tc) of ~54 K. Interestingly, the SPS process of SmFeAsO0.80F0.20 increases the sample densities up to 97-98% and confirms the optimized synthesis conditions of 900°C for 5-10 min; however, the increased sintering temperature or duration reduces Tc due to the possible evaporation of lighter elements, particularly fluorine. Furthermore, the SPS technique is unable to reduce the observed impurity phases for the Sm1111, which is similar to the CSP and HP-HTS processes. A slight increment in the Jc by the SPS process is observed due to the enhancement of sample density. A comparative analysis of Sm1111 superconductors prepared by SPS is performed with CSP and HP-HTS processes, suggesting that an increased sample density is ineffective on the superconducting properties in the presence of the impurity phases. This finding can be beneficial for the fundamental and applied research of iron-based superconductor (FBS).

Title: Morphological stability of Au-metal nanosatellites
Authors: Sofia Zinzani, Robert M. Jones, Mirko Vanzan, Francesca Baletto
Abstract: Hybrid metallic nanoalloys combining plasmonic and catalytic metals are essential for developing advanced photocatalysts. A promising design called core-satellites comprises a spherical nanogold dotted with smaller transition-metal clusters. While these nanoalloys' catalytic activity and hot-carriers generation have been extensively studied, their morphological stability remains poorly explored. Performing molecular dynamics simulations, we highlight the critical role of the transition metal in governing the morphological stability of plasmonic core-satellites. Rh satellites exhibit the highest stability, while only 27\% Pt and 16\% Pd satellites survive after 200 ns at 600K. AuPt and AuPd quickly rearrange into single spherical nanostructures. AuPt forms icosahedra with an Au outer shell due to Au's surface diffusion. AuPd favors FCC and decahedral shapes and shows the highest Au mobility and significant Pd interdiffusion. In contrast, AuRh maintains its original shape, exhibiting a slow surface diffusion of gold onto rhodium and negligible mixing.

Title: Tracking shear mode dynamics across the glass transition in a 2D colloidal system
Authors: Jimin Bai, Peter Keim, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Long-wavelength collective shear dynamics are profoundly different in solids and liquids. According to the theoretical framework developed by Maxwell and Frenkel, collective shear waves vanish upon melting by acquiring a characteristic wave-vector gap, known as the $k$-gap. While this prediction has been supported by numerous simulations, experimental validation remains limited. In this work, we track the dispersion relation of collective shear modes in a two-dimensional colloidal system and provide direct experimental evidence for the emergence of a $k$-gap. This gap appears at an effective temperature consistent with the onset of the glass transition and the vanishing of the static shear modulus. Our results not only confirm the predictions of the Maxwell-Frenkel framework but also highlight their relevance across continuous melting processes originating from low-temperature amorphous solid phases.

Title: Quantum melting of generalized electron crystal in twisted bilayer MoSe2
Authors: Qi Jun Zong, Haolin Wang, Qi Zhang, Xinle Cheng, Yangchen He, Qiaoling Xu, Ammon Fischer, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Daniel A. Rhodes, Lede Xian, Dante M. Kennes, Angel Rubio, Geliang Yu, Lei Wang
Abstract: Electrons can form an ordered solid crystal phase ascribed to the interplay between Coulomb repulsion and kinetic energy. Tuning these energy scales can drive a phase transition from electron solid to liquid, i.e. melting of Wigner crystal. Generalized Wigner crystals (GWCs) pinned to moire superlattices have been reported by optical and scanning-probe-based methods. Using transport measurements to investigate GWCs is vital to a complete characterization, however, still poses a significant challenge due to difficulties in making reliable electrical contacts. Here, we report the electrical transport detection of GWCs at fractional fillings nu = 2/5, 1/2, 3/5, 2/3, 8/9, 10/9, and 4/3 in twisted bilayer MoSe2. We further observe that these GWCs undergo continuous quantum melting transitions to liquid phases by tuning doping density, magnetic and displacement fields, manifested by quantum critical scaling behaviors. Our findings establish twisted bilayer MoSe2 as a novel system to study strongly correlated states of matter and their quantum phase transitions.

Title: Probing Superfluidity with Quantum Vortex Necklaces
Authors: Andrea Richaud, Pietro Massignan
Abstract: We present a method for measuring the superfluid fraction of a Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) without relying on external perturbations or imposed optical lattices. Our approach leverages the intrinsic rotation of vortex necklaces in one component of a binary superfluid mixture, where the vortex cores act as effective potential wells for the second component. The rotation of the vortex necklace transfers angular momentum to the latter, enabling a direct determination of its effective moment of inertia. Comparing this value with its classical counterpart allows us to extract the superfluid fraction, which we find to be precisely bracketed by the Leggett bounds. By increasing intercomponent interactions, the second component undergoes a crossover from a delocalized and fully superfluid state to an insulating state consisting of a regular array of localized density peaks. Furthermore, the dynamical instability of vortex necklaces provides a natural framework for investigating superfluidity in dynamically evolving and disordered landscapes.

Title: Emergent Orbital Dynamics in Strongly Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems
Authors: A. S. Miñarro, G. Herranz
Abstract: The interplay between spin and orbital degrees of freedom gives rise to a variety of emergent phases in correlated 4d and 5d transition-metal systems. Strong spin-orbit coupling (SOC) significantly modifies Jahn-Teller (JT) physics, often suppressing static distortions or promoting dynamic fluctuations, thereby reducing or even quenching orbital polarization. While intersite hybridization is a fundamental aspect of crystalline solids, its role in shaping the dynamics of spin-orbital entangled states has received comparatively little attention. Remarkably, our analysis shows that electronic hopping can locally restore orbital polarization when the ground state is perturbed, potentially leaving measurable fingerprints in the spectra of spin-orbital excitations. Using a Matsubara lattice formalism, we study how local orbital perturbations propagate through correlated, spin-orbit-entangled systems. When intersite hopping is included, such perturbations induce shortrange orbital polarization with a characteristic orthogonal response at nearest-neighbor sites. These hopping-mediated reconstructions may contribute to low-energy spectroscopic signals, potentially overlapping with other excitations, and underscore the importance of including orbital dynamics in the interpretation of spectral data. Our results provide guidance for identifying such signatures and offer a framework for understanding dynamical responses in spin-orbit-entangled materials.

Title: Monte Carlo approach to quantum work in strongly correlated electron systems
Authors: Qian-Xi Zhao, Jian-Jun Dong, Zi-Xiang Hu
Abstract: We develop a Monte Carlo framework to analyze the statistics of quantum work in correlated electron systems. Using the Ising-Kondo model in heavy fermions as a paradigmatic platform, we thoroughly illustrate the process of determining the moment generating function of quantum work under nonequilibrium conditions in detail. Based on this function, we systematically investigate essential statistical quantities, including the mean irreversible work density, the mean work density, variance, and the third central moment of quantum work across different quench processes. Our findings highlight distinct singularities in these quantities at the metal-insulator phase transition point at low temperatures. However, these singularities disappear, and the transition becomes a smooth crossover at high temperatures. This stark contrast underscores quantum work as an effective thermodynamic tool for identifying metal-insulator phase transitions. Our approach provides a promising new framework for investigating nonequilibrium quantum thermodynamics in strongly correlated electron systems.

Title: Dissipatively dressed quasiparticles in boundary driven integrable spin chains
Authors: Vladislav Popkov, Xin Zhang, Carlo Presilla, Tomaž Prosen
Abstract: The nonequilibrium steady state (NESS) of integrable spin chains experiencing strong boundary dissipation is accounted by introducing quasiparticles with a renormalized -- dissipatively dressed -- dispersion relation. This allows us to evaluate the spectrum of the NESS in terms of the Bethe ansatz equations for a related coherent system which has the same set of eigenstates, the so-called dissipation-projected Hamiltonian. We find explicit analytic expressions for the dressed energies of the XXX and XXZ models with effective, i.e., induced by the dissipation, diagonal boundary fields, which are U(1) invariant, as well as the XXZ and XYZ models with effective non-diagonal boundary fields. In all cases, the dissipative dressing generates an extra singularity in the dispersion relation, substantially altering the NESS spectrum with respect to the spectrum of the corresponding coherent model.

Title: Phase engineering of MoS$_2$ monolayers: A pathway to enhanced lithium-polysulfide battery performance
Authors: J. W. González, E. Flórez, R. A. Gallardo, J. D. Correa
Abstract: This study explores the potential of MoS$_2$ polymorphs, specifically the semiconducting 2H phase and the metallic 1T$^\prime$ phase, as anchoring materials to enhance the electrochemical performance of lithium-sulfur (Li-S) batteries. Using density functional theory calculations, we show that 1T$^\prime$-MoS$_2$ exhibits stronger Li-S interactions, greater charge transfer, and enhanced catalytic activity compared to its 2H counterpart, effectively suppressing polysulfide dissolution and facilitating redox reactions. The reversible 2H$\leftrightarrow$1T$^\prime$ transition offers a tunable design space for balancing conductivity and structural stability. These findings position hybrid MoS$_2$ architectures as promising platforms for next-generation Li-S batteries with improved energy density, cycling stability, and rate capability.

Title: Synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ as a new prototype structure for ternary superhydrides recoverable at ambient pressure
Authors: M. Caussé, L. Toraille, G. Geneste, P. Loubeyre
Abstract: Reaching pressures in the 100 GPa range enables the synthesis of hydrogen-rich compounds, with nontraditional H stoichiometries and H sublattices, called superhydrides. Record-breaking superconductivity temperature in some superhydrides have attracted great interest. A crucial next step is to stabilize superhydrides outside of high-pressure environments, leading to a search beyond binary hydrides to ternary hydrides. Here, we report the synthesis of Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ at pressures starting at 60 GPa by compressing an hydrogenated Y-Fe compound, embedded in hydrogen in a laser-heated diamond anvil cell. Single-crystal X-ray diffraction allowed us to resolve the Y$_3$Fe$_4$ lattice skeleton, and a constrained ab initio structural search was used to position the hydrogen atoms. FeH$_8$ cubic molecular units form building blocks which are connected edge-to-edge by sharing two hydrogen atoms, creating a framework that hosts Y cations. Remarkably, Y$_3$Fe$_4$H$_{20}$ maintains its structure through decompression, making it the first superhydride recovered metastable under ambient conditions.

Title: Interfacial Effects Determine Nonequilibrium Phase Behaviors in Chemically Driven Fluids
Authors: Yongick Cho, William M. Jacobs
Abstract: Coupling between chemical fuel consumption and phase separation can lead to condensation at a nonequilibrium steady state, resulting in phase behaviors that are not described by equilibrium thermodynamics. Theoretical models of such "chemically driven fluids" typically invoke near-equilibrium approximations at small length scales. However, because dissipation occurs due to both molecular-scale chemical reactions and mesoscale diffusive transport, it has remained unclear which properties of phase-separated reaction-diffusion systems can be assumed to be at an effective equilibrium. Here we use microscopic simulations to show that mesoscopic fluxes are dependent on nonequilibrium fluctuations at phase-separated interfaces. We further develop a first-principles theory to predict nonequilibrium coexistence curves, localization of mesoscopic fluxes near phase-separated interfaces, and droplet size-scaling relations in good agreement with simulations. Our findings highlight the central role of interfacial properties in governing nonequilibrium condensation and have broad implications for droplet nucleation, coarsening, and size control in chemically driven fluids.

Title: First-principles study of metal-biphenylene interfaces: structural, electronic, and catalytic properties
Authors: Maicon P. Lebre, Dominike Pacine, Erika N. Lima, Alexandre A. C. Cotta, Igor S. S. de Oliveira
Abstract: We employ first-principles density functional theory (DFT) calculations to investigate the structural, electronic, and catalytic properties of biphenylene supported on various metal substrates. The substrates considered are the (111) surfaces of Ag, Au, Ni, Pd, Pt, Cu, Al, and the Cu$_3$Au alloy. Our results reveal how the interaction between biphenylene and the substrate governs its stability, degree of corrugation, electronic hybridization, and interfacial charge transfer. In particular, we observe a clear trend where weakly interacting metals preserve the intrinsic features of biphenylene, while more reactive substrates lead to significant structural and electronic modifications. We further evaluate the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) activity of these systems, showing that certain metal supports, especially Pd, Pt, Ag, and Cu, can enhance the catalytic performance of biphenylene. Notably, Ag and Cu combine good catalytic activity with lower cost and chemical stability, offering a promising balance for practical applications. These findings provide insights into the design of biphenylene-metal interfaces, supporting their use in next-generation electronic and catalytic devices.

Title: Improvement of H2O2 electrogeneration using a Vulcan XC72 carbon-based electrocatalyst modified with Ce-doped Nb2O5
Authors: Aline B. Trench, João Paulo C. Moura, Vanessa S. Antonin, Caio Machado Fernandes, Liying Liu, Mauro C. Santos
Abstract: The use of the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) for in-situ production of H2O2 is an attractive alternative to replace the methods based on anthraquinone oxidation. This study investigates the modification of Vulcan XC72 carbon with Ce-doped Nb2O5 in different molar proportions and its application as electrocatalysts in the ORR. One performed the characterization of the electrocatalysts using X-ray diffraction, Raman spectroscopy, scanning electron microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, contact angle measurements, and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. Subsequently, the electrocatalysts were analyzed for the ORR and the Nb2O5 doped with 0.5% Ce showing the highest electrocatalytic response. This electrocatalyst was also employed as a gas diffusion electrode and exhibited more significant H2O2 production at all potentials than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified solely with Nb2O5. At the applied potentials of -1.3 V and -1.9 V, it produced 105% and 86% more H2O2, respectively, than the Vulcan XC72 carbon modified only with Nb2O5. These results can be attributed to the doping of Nb2O5 with 0.5% Ce, which induces local distortions in the crystal lattice of Nb2O5 due to the difference in ionic radius between Nb5+ and Ce3+, which combined with increased hydrophilicity and wetting properties, may have facilitated electron transfer and O2 transport, favoring the ORR.

Title: Magnetic vortex writing and local reversal seeding in artificial spin-vortex ice via all-optical and surface-probe control
Authors: Holly Holder, Jack C. Gartside, Alex Vanstone, Troy Dion, Xiaofei Xiao, Kilian D. Stenning, Tingjun Zheng, Daniel Bromley, Tobias Farchy, Rupert F. Oulton, Will R. Branford
Abstract: Artificial spin-vortex ice ('ASVI') is a reconfigurable nanomagnetic metamaterial consisting of magnetic nanoislands tailored to support both Ising macrospin and vortex textures. ASVI has recently shown functional applications including reconfigurable magnonics and neuromorphic computing, where the introduction of vortex textures broadens functionality beyond conventional artificial spin ice which generally supports macrospin states. However, local control of writing vortex states in ASVI remains an open challenge. Here we demonstrate techniques for field-free magnetic vortex writing in ASVI. We expand ASVI to support metastable macrospin, single-vortex and double-vortex states. All-optical writing via focused laser illumination can locally write double-vortex textures, and surface-probe writing using an MFM tip can locally write single vortex states. We leverage this writing to tailor and explore the reconfigurable energy landscape of ASVI, demonstrating programmable local seeding of avalanche-like reversal events. The global field-free texture selective writing techniques reported here expand the suite of nanomagnetic control techniques, with a host of future applications including fundamental studies of avalanche dynamics, physical memory, and direct writing of nanomagnetic 'weights' in physical neuromorphic neural networks.

Title: Bose-Einstein condensation in exotic lattice geometries
Authors: Kamil Dutkiewicz, Marcin Płodzień, Abel Rojo-Francàs, Bruno Juliá-Díaz, Maciej Lewenstein, Tobias Grass
Abstract: Modern quantum engineering techniques allow for synthesizing quantum systems in exotic lattice geometries, from self-similar fractal networks to negatively curved hyperbolic graphs. We demonstrate that these structures profoundly reshape Bose-Einstein condensation. Fractal lattices dramatically lower the condensation temperature, while hyperbolic lattices cause it to increase as the system grows - a behavior not seen in ordinary two-dimensional arrays, where the condensation temperature vanishes in the large-size limit. The underlying geometry also controls condensate fluctuations, enhancing them on fractal networks but suppressing them on hyperbolic graphs compared with regular one-dimensional or two-dimensional lattices. When strong repulsive interactions are included, the gas enters a Mott insulating state. A multi-site Gutzwiller approach finds a smooth interpolation between the characteristic insulating lobes of one-dimensional and two-dimensional systems. Re-entrant Mott transitions are seen within a first-order resummed hopping expansion. Our findings establish lattice geometry as a powerful tuning knob for quantum phase phenomena and pave the way for experimental exploration in photonic waveguide arrays and Rydberg-atom tweezer arrays.

Title: Hydrogen peroxide electrogeneration from O2 electroreduction: a review focusing on carbon electrocatalysts and environmental applications

Abstract: Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) stands as one of the foremost utilized oxidizing agents in modern times. The established method for its production involves the intricate and costly anthraquinone process. However, a promising alternative pathway is the electrochemical hydrogen peroxide production, accomplished through the oxygen reduction reaction via a 2-electron pathway. This method not only simplifies the production process but also upholds environmental sustainability, especially when compared to the conventional anthraquinone method. In this review paper, recent works from the literature focusing on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction promoted by carbon electrocatalysts are summarized. The practical applications of these materials in the treatment of effluents contaminated with different pollutants (drugs, dyes, pesticides, and herbicides) are presented. Water treatment aiming to address these issues can be achieved through advanced oxidation electrochemical processes such as electro-Fenton, solar-electro-Fenton, and photo-electro-Fenton. These processes are discussed in detail in this work and the possible radicals that degrade the pollutants in each case are highlighted. The review broadens its scope to encompass contemporary computational simulations focused on the 2-electron oxygen reduction reaction, employing different models to describe carbon-based electrocatalysts. Finally, perspectives and future challenges in the area of carbon-based electrocatalysts for H2O2 electrogeneration are discussed. This review paper presents a forward-oriented viewpoint of present innovations and pragmatic implementations, delineating forthcoming challenges and prospects of this ever-evolving field.

Title: Higher order Jacobi method for solving a system of linear equations
Authors: Nithin Kumar Goona, Lama Tarsissi
Abstract: This work proposes a higher-order iterative framework for solving matrix equations, inspired by the structure and functionality of neural networks. A modification of the classical Jacobi method is introduced to compute higher-order coefficient matrices through matrix-matrix multiplications. The resulting method, termed the higher-order Jacobi method, structurally resembles a shallow linear network and allows direct computation of the inverse of the coefficient matrix. Building on this, an iterative scheme is developed that, once the network parameters are determined for a known system, enables efficient resolution of system variations without re-computing the coefficients. This iterative process naturally assumes the form of a deep recurrent neural network. The proposed approach moves beyond conventional Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) by providing an explicit, training-free definition of network parameters rooted in physical and mathematical formulations. Computational analysis demonstrates improved order of complexity, suggesting a promising direction for algorithmic efficiency in solving linear systems. This methodology opens avenues for interpretable and scalable solutions to physically motivated problems in computational science.

Title: Photo-induced electronic excitations drive polymerization of carbon monoxide: A first-principles study
Authors: Rasool Ahmad, Jonathan C. Crowhurst, Stanimir A. Bonev
Abstract: Under pressure, carbon monoxide (CO) transforms into a polymer that can be recovered to ambient conditions. While this transformation can occur without additional stimuli, experimental observations have shown that laser irradiation can induce a similar transformation at reduced pressure. The resulting polymeric phase, which is metastable under ambient conditions, releases energy through decomposition into more stable configurations. Using time-dependent density functional theory and Born-Oppenheimer molecular dynamics simulations, we investigate the mechanism by which electronic excitation facilitates CO polymerization. Our calculations reveal that electronic excitation enhances carbon-carbon bonding, enabling polymerization at pressures significantly lower than those required by conventional compression methods. These findings suggest that a photo-assisted approach could be employed to synthesize novel, potentially energetic materials under less demanding pressure conditions.

Title: Lorentz-violating QED inspired superconductivity
Authors: A.F.Morais, M.C.Araújo, T.T.Saraiva, J. Furtado
Abstract: We studied a Lorentz-violating inspired Ginzburg-Landau model for superconductivity where we considered a CPT-odd contribution given by $(k_{AF})^{\mu}$, also known as the Carroll-Field-Jackiw term. In the static limit of the equations, we could find a pair of modified Ginzburg-Landau equations. Furthermore, these equations were reduced to the London equation for the magnetic field when assumed that the characteristic length of the order parameter is much smaller than the characteristic length of the magnetic field, i.e. the London penetration length. Our numerical solutions showed a simple Meissner state when this new term is small compared to $\lambda_L$ and a phase transition into phases with strong in-plane currents and anomalous vortices for large contributions. This model becomes useful in exemplifying the changes in the phenomenology of superconductors when the setup of the system shows an important breakdown of Lorentz invariance. Based on these results, we discuss how such models might be the hallmark of unusual superconducting states where there is a direction where the system shows stratification, as in anapole superconductors UTe$_2$.

Title: Sliding Friction of Hard Sliders on Rubber: Theory and Experiment
Authors: R. Xu, B.N.J Persson
Abstract: We present a study of sliding friction for rigid triangular steel sliders on soft rubber substrates under both lubricated and dry conditions. For rubber surfaces lubricated with a thin film of silicone oil, the measured sliding friction at room temperature agrees well with theoretical predictions obtained from a viscoelastic model originally developed for rolling friction. On the lubricated surface, the sliding friction is primarily due to bulk viscoelastic energy dissipation in the rubber. The model, which includes strain-dependent softening of the rubber modulus, accurately predicts the experimental friction curves. At lower temperatures ($T = -20^\circ {\rm C}$ and $-40^\circ {\rm C}$), the measured friction exceeds the theoretical prediction. We attribute this increase to penetration of the lubricant film by surface asperities, leading to a larger adhesive contribution. For dry surfaces, the adhesive contribution becomes dominant. By subtracting the viscoelastic component inferred from the lubricated case, we estimate the interfacial frictional shear stress. This shear stress increases approximately linearly with the logarithm of the sliding speed, consistent with stress-augmented thermal activation mechanisms.

Title: Nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric transport from quantum geometry
Authors: Yuan Fang, Shouvik Sur, Yonglong Xie, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Quantum geometry may enable the development of quantum phases ranging from superconductivity to correlated topological states. One powerful probe of quantum geometry is the nonlinear Hall response which detects Berry curvature dipole in systems with time-reversal invariance and broken inversion symmetry. With broken time-reversal symmetry, this response is also associated with quantum metric dipole. Here we investigate nonlinear thermal and thermoelectric responses, which provide a wealth of new information about quantum geometry. In particular, we uncover a web of connections between these quantities that parallel the standard Wiedemann-Franz and Mott relations. Implications for the studies of a variety of topological systems, including Weyl-Kondo semimetals and Bernal bilayer graphene, are discussed.

Title: Topological Phases, Criticality, and Mixed State Order in a Hubbard Quantum Simulator
Authors: Lin Su, Rahul Sahay, Michal Szurek, Alexander Douglas, Ognjen Markovic, Ceren B. Dag, Ruben Verresen, Markus Greiner
Abstract: Phases of matter are conventionally distinguished from one another by local observables. Topological quantum phases lie outside this paradigm; their differences can only be learned by examining them globally. This has striking implications for the stability of these phases, their classification, and the phase transitions between them. In this work, we experimentally demonstrate these implications using interacting magnetic erbium atoms in an optical lattice. We show that a Mott insulator and a pinned charge-density wave in one dimension are in distinct crystalline symmetry-protected topological phases (CSPTs). The quantum phase transition separating them is revealed by measuring nonlocal string order parameters using site-resolved imaging. Remarkably, stacking two copies of these states eliminates the critical point -- a signature feature of topological phases that underlies their classification. Moreover, we show that while a programmable symmetry-breaking disorder pattern can also remove this critical point, averaging over disorder restores it, supporting recent theoretical predictions of mixed-state order. Finally, we highlight a connection between one of these CSPTs and the Haldane insulator, and detect signatures of the transition between the Haldane and the Mott insulator. Our results establish a path toward probing broader symmetry-protected topology and mixed-state order in programmable quantum devices.

Title: Stabilizer entropy in non-integrable quantum evolutions
Authors: Jovan Odavić, Michele Viscardi, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: Entanglement and stabilizer entropy are both involved in the onset of complex behavior in quantum many-body systems. Their interplay is at the root of complexity of simulability, scrambling, thermalization and typicality. In this work, we study the dynamics of entanglement, stabilizer entropy, and a novel quantity assessing their interplay - called anti-flatness, after a quantum quench of a spin chain. We find that free-fermion theories show a gap in the long-time behavior of these resources compared to their random matrix theory value while non-integrable models saturate it.

Title: Stabilizer Entropy and entanglement complexity in the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
Authors: Barbara Jasser, Jovan Odavic, Alioscia Hamma
Abstract: The Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model is of paramount importance for the understanding of both strange metals and a microscopic theory of two-dimensional gravity. We study the interplay between Stabilizer Rényi Entropy (SRE) and entanglement entropy in both the ground state and highly excited states of the SYK4+SYK2 model interpolating the highly chaotic four-body interactions model with the integrable two-body interactions one. The interplay between these quantities is assessed also through universal statistics of the entanglement spectrum and its anti-flatness. We find that SYK4 is indeed characterized by a complex pattern of both entanglement and non-stabilizer resources while SYK2 is non-universal and not complex. We discuss the fragility and robustness of these features depending on the interpolation parameter.

Title: Readout sweet spots for spin qubits with strong spin-orbit interaction
Authors: Domonkos Svastits, Bence Hetényi, Gábor Széchenyi, James Wootton, Daniel Loss, Stefano Bosco, András Pályi
Abstract: Qubit readout schemes often deviate from ideal projective measurements, introducing critical issues that limit quantum computing performance. In this work, we model charge-sensing-based readout for semiconductor spin qubits in double quantum dots, and identify key error mechanisms caused by the back-action of the charge sensor. We quantify how the charge noise of the sensor, residual tunneling, and $g$-tensor modulation degrade readout fidelity, induce a mixed post-measurement state, and cause leakage from the computational subspace. For state-of-the-art systems with strong spin-orbit interaction and electrically tunable $g$-tensors, we identify a readout sweet spot, that is, a special device configuration where readout is closest to projective. Our framework provides a foundation for developing effective readout error mitigation strategies, with broad applications for optimizing readout performance for a variety of charge-sensing techniques, advancing quantum protocols, and improving adaptive circuits for error correction.

Title: Effects of symmetry and hydrodynamics on the cohesion of groups of swimmers
Authors: Mohamed Niged Mabrouk, Daniel Floryan
Abstract: When groups of inertial swimmers move together, hydrodynamic interactions play a key role in shaping their collective dynamics, including the cohesion of the group. To explore how these interactions influence group cohesion, we develop a three-dimensional, inviscid, far-field model of a swimmer. Focusing on symmetric triangular, diamond, and circular group arrangements, we investigate whether passive hydrodynamics alone can promote cohesive behavior, and what role symmetry of the group plays. While small symmetric (and even asymmetric) groups can be cohesive, larger groups typically are not, instead breaking apart into smaller, self-organized subgroups that are cohesive. Notably, we discover circular arrangements of swimmers that chase each other around a circle, resembling the milling behavior of natural fish schools; we call this hydrodynamic milling. Hydrodynamic milling is cohesive in the sense that it is a fixed point of a particular Poincaré map, but it is unstable, especially to asymmetric perturbations. Our findings suggest that while passive hydrodynamics alone cannot sustain large-scale cohesion indefinitely, controlling interactions between subgroups, or controlling the behavior of only the periphery of a large group, could potentially enable stable collective behavior with minimal active input.

Title: Bloch oscillation with a diatomic tight-binding model on quantum computers
Authors: Peng Guo, Jaime Park, Frank X. Lee
Abstract: We aim to explore a more efficient way to simulate few-body dynamics on quantum computers. Instead of mapping the second quantization of the system Hamiltonian to qubit Pauli gates representation via the Jordan-Wigner transform, we propose to use the few-body Hamiltonian matrix under the statevector basis representation which is more economical on the required number of quantum registers. For a single-particle excitation state on a one-dimensional chain, $\Gamma$ qubits can simulate $N=2^\Gamma$ number of sites, in comparison to $N$ qubits for $N$ sites via the Jordan-Wigner approach. A two-band diatomic tight-binding model is used to demonstrate the effectiveness of the statevector basis representation. Both one-particle and two-particle quantum circuits are constructed and some numerical tests on IBM hardware are presented.

Title: Thermodynamic Analysis for Harmonic Oscillator with Position-Dependent Mass
Authors: Daniel Sabi Takou, Assimiou Yarou Mora, Gabriel Y. H. Avossevou
Abstract: In this paper, we examine the thermodynamic behavior of a quantum harmonic oscillator with a position-dependent mass (PDM), where spatial inhomogeneity is modeled through a deformation parameter {\alpha}. Based on the exact energy spectrum, we explore the resulting thermodynamic quantities and superstatistics. Our findings reveal that increasing {\alpha} leads to a decrease in entropy and specific heat, reflecting a confinement-induced reduction in the number of accessible states. The partition function and free energy exhibit smooth behavior across all parameter regimes, indicating the absence of critical phase transitions. This study underscores the influence of mass deformation on quantum thermal responses and demonstrates that, while the overall thermodynamic trends are consistent with those reported in the literature, certain distinctive features emerge due to the specific form of the deformation.

Title: Observing dynamics of distinct structural transitions in trapped-ion clusters
Authors: Akhil Ayyadevara, Anand Prakash, Shovan Dutta, Arun Paramekanti, S. A. Rangwala
Abstract: Interacting many-particle systems can self-organize into a rich variety of crystalline structures. While symmetry considerations provide a powerful framework for predicting whether structural transitions between crystal states are continuous or discontinuous, collective lattice dynamics offer complementary insights into the microscopic mechanisms that drive these transitions. Laser-cooled ions in electromagnetic traps present a pristine and highly controllable, few-body system for examining this interplay of symmetry and dynamics. Here, we use real-time fluorescence imaging while deforming the trapping potential to observe a variety of structural transitions in three-dimensional unit-cell-sized ion clusters. We probe their distinct dynamical signatures: mode softening indicating a lattice instability at a symmetry-breaking continuous transition, stochastic switching between stable structures at a discontinuous transition, and hysteresis near a spinodal point. Notably, we observe a triple point-like feature where a discontinuous symmetry-changing transition and a continuous symmetry-breaking transition occur simultaneously. Analytical calculations based on symmetry considerations and numerical analysis of collective modes provide a comprehensive understanding of the observed dynamics. Our results demonstrate tunable Coulomb clusters as a versatile platform to investigate how symmetry, energy landscapes, and dynamical pathways govern structural transitions in confined few-body systems.

Title: Strict advantage of complex quantum theory in a communication task
Authors: Thomas J. Elliott
Abstract: Standard formulations of quantum theory are based on complex numbers: Quantum states can be in superpositions, with weights given by complex probability amplitudes. Motivated by quantum theory promising a range of practical advantages over classical for a multitude of tasks, we investigate how the presence of complex amplitudes in quantum theory can yield operational advantages over counterpart real formulations. We identify a straightforward communication task for which complex quantum theory exhibits a provably lower communication cost than not just any classical approach, but also any approach based on real quantum theory. We certify the necessity of complex quantum theory for optimal approaches to the task through geometric properties of quantum state ensembles that witness the presence of basis-independent complexity. This substantiates a strict operational advantage of complex quantum theory. We discuss the relevance of this finding for quantum advantages in stochastic simulation.

Title: Extreme value statistics and eigenstate thermalization in kicked quantum chaotic spin-$1/2$ chains
Authors: Tanay Pathak, Masaki Tezuka
Abstract: It is often expected (and assumed) for a quantum chaotic system that the presence of correlated eigenvalues implies that all the other properties as dictated by random matrix theory are satisfied. We demonstrate using the spin-$1/2$ kicked field Ising model that this is not necessarily true. We study the properties of eigenvalues of the reduced density matrix for this model, which constitutes the entanglement spectrum. It is shown that the largest eigenvalue does not follow the expected Tracy--Widom distribution even for the large system sizes considered. The distribution instead follows the extreme value distribution of Weibull type. Furthermore, we also show that such deviations do not lead to drastic change in the thermalization property of this system by showing that the models satisfy the diagonal and off-diagonal eigenstate thermalization hypothesis. Finally, we study the spin-spin autocorrelation function and numerically show that it has the characteristic behavior for chaotic systems: it decreases exponentially and saturates to a value at late time that decreases with system size.

Title: Twisted Partition Functions as Order Parameters
Authors: Jun Maeda, Yuya Tanizaki
Abstract: For quantum field theories with global symmetry, we can study the behavior of the partition function with the background gauge field to diagnose different quantum phases. For the case of discrete symmetries, we find that the symmetry-twisted partition function works as an order parameter that discriminates spontaneous symmetry breaking (SSB), symmetry-protected topological (SPT) states, and symmetry-enriched topological (SET) states. We then consider its application to the case of 4d Yang-Mills theory with adjoint matters to understand the relation between the twisted partition function and the Wilson-'t Hooft classification. We also study its behavior for the spontaneously broken U(1) symmetry and interpret the result from the viewpoint of the mixed anomaly with the emergent solitonic symmetry.

Title: The effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via preferential attachment
Authors: Barak Budnick, Ofer Biham, Eytan Katzav
Abstract: We present analytical results for the effect of preferential node deletion on the structure of networks that evolve via node addition and preferential attachment. To this end, we consider a preferential-attachment-preferential-deletion (PAPD) model, in which at each time step, with probability $P_{\rm add}$ there is a growth step where an isolated node is added to the network, followed by the addition of $m$ edges, where each edge connects a node selected uniformly at random to a node selected preferentially in proportion to its degree. Alternatively, with probability $P_{\rm del}=1-P_{\rm add}$ there is a contraction step, in which a preferentially selected node is deleted and its links are erased. The balance between the growth and contraction processes is captured by the growth/contraction rate $\eta=P_{\rm add}-P_{\rm del}$. For $0 < \eta \le 1$ the overall process is of network growth, while for $-1\le\eta<0$ the overall process is of network contraction. Using the master equation and the generating function formalism, we study the time-dependent degree distribution $P_t(k)$. It is found that for each value of $m>0$ there is a critical value $\eta_c(m)=-(m-2)/(m+2)$ such that for $\eta_c(m)<\eta\le1$ the degree distribution $P_t(k)$ converges towards a stationary distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$. In the special case of pure growth, where $\eta=1$, the model is reduced to a preferential attachment growth model and $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits a power-law tail, which is a characteristic of scale-free networks. In contrast, for $\eta_c(m)<\eta<1$ the distribution $P_{\rm st}(k)$ exhibits an exponential tail, which has a well-defined this http URL implies a phase transition at $\eta=1$, in contrast with the preferential-attachment-random-deletion (PARD) model [B. Budnick, O. Biham and E. Katzav, J. Stat. Mech. 013401 (2025)], in which the power-law tail remains intact as long as $\eta>0$.

Title: Quantum thermodynamics of continuous feedback control
Authors: Kacper Prech, Joël Aschwanden, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: The laws of thermodynamics are a cornerstone for describing nanoscale and open quantum systems. However, formulating these laws for systems under continuous feedback control and under experimentally relevant conditions is challenging. In this work, we lay out a formalism for the laws of thermodynamics in an open quantum system under continuous measurement and feedback described by a Quantum Fokker Planck Master Equation. We derive expressions for work, heat, and measurement-induced energy changes, and we investigate entropy production and fluctuation theorems. We illustrate our results with a continuous version of a measurement-driven Szilard engine, as well as a work extraction scheme in a two-level system under bang-bang control. Our results provide insights into the energetics as well as the irreversibility of classical and quantum systems under continuous feedback control.

Title: Universal estimates for the density of states for aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems
Authors: Habib Ammari, Silvio Barandun, Bryn Davies, Erik Orvehed Hiltunen, Alexander Uhlmann
Abstract: We consider the spectral properties of aperiodic block subwavelength resonator systems in one dimension, with a primary focus on the density of states. We prove that for random block configurations, as the number of blocks $M\to \infty$, the integrated density of states converges to a non-random, continuous function. We show both analytically and numerically that the density of states exhibits a tripartite decomposition: it vanishes identically within bandgaps; it forms smooth, band-like distributions in shared pass bands (a consequence of constructive eigenmode interactions); and, most notably, it exhibits a distinct fractal-like character in hybridisation regions. We demonstrate that this fractal-like behaviour stems from the limited interaction between eigenmodes within these hybridisation regions. Capitalising on this insight, we introduce an efficient meta-atom approach that enables rapid and accurate prediction of the density of states in these hybridisation regions. This approach is shown to extend to systems with quasiperiodic and hyperuniform arrangements of blocks.

Title: Tuning Topological States by Dissipation
Authors: Xue-Ping Ren, Yue Hu, Long-Ye Lu, Xin-Ran Ma, Ji-Yao Fan, Cui-Xian Guo, Su-Peng Kou
Abstract: The bulk-boundary correspondence plays a crucial role in topological quantum systems, however,this principle is broken in non-Hermitian systems. The breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence indicates that the global phase diagrams under open boundary conditions are significantly different from those under periodic boundary conditions. In this paper, we investigate how the bulk-boundary correspondence breaks down by gradually tearing the system. We find that by tuning the strength of gain and loss domain wall, in the thermodynamic limit, the global phase diagrams of the topological system become the hybrids of those under periodic and open boundary conditions. Moreover, during the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence, several phase transitions occur. This situation is quite different from earlier work, where the breakdown of the bulk-boundary correspondence in the thermodynamic limit occurred suddenly due to infinitesimal boundary hopping amplitudes. To support our conclusions, we provide both analytical and numerical calculations. These results help researchers better understand non-Hermitian topological systems.

Title: Open interacting particle systems and Ising measures
Authors: Ngo P.N. Ngoc, Gunter M. Schütz
Abstract: We first survey some open questions concerning stochastic interacting particle systems with open boundaries. Then, an asymmetric exclusion process with open boundaries that generalizes the lattice gas model of Katz, Lebowitz, and Spohn is introduced and invariance of the one-dimensional Ising measure is proved. The stationary current is computed in explicit form and is shown to exhibit current reversal at some density. Based on the extremal-current principle for one-dimensional driven diffusive systems with one conservation law, the phase diagram for boundary-induced phase transitions is conjectured for this case. There are two extremal-current phases, unlike in the open ASEP (one extremal-current phase) or in the conventional KLS model (one or three extremal-current phases).

Title: Pressure dependence of the interfacial polarization and negative activation volume for dielectric relaxation in heterogeneous systems
Authors: Anthony N. Papathanassiou
Abstract: Negative activation volumes for dielectric relaxation are rarely reported in solid state physics and are limited to atomic scale processes. Broadband Dielectric Spectroscopy on heterogeneous systems, such as polycrystalline calcite and magnesite, hosting water in their porous spce, detectedintense dielectric relaxation mechanisms related to the interfacial polarization. The characteristic relaxation frequency increased uponhydrostatic compression, indicating that the activation volumes for relaxation are negative. However, a theoretical interpretation for the negative sign of the activation volume is lacking up to date. Within the frame of effective medium approximation for mesoscopic heterogeneous two phase solid - fluid systems, we investigate how the synergyof the pressure depedencies of polarization and electric charge transport, respectively, dictate the pressure dependence of interfacial polarization . predicting the value of the effective activation volume. Our theoretical approach succeeds in predicting the negative sign and magnitude of the activation volume in water saturated polycrystalline materials.

Title: Dynamic Reservoir Computing with Physical Neuromorphic Networks
Authors: Yinhao Xu, Georg A. Gottwald, Zdenka Kuncic
Abstract: Reservoir Computing (RC) with physical systems requires an understanding of the underlying structure and internal dynamics of the specific physical reservoir. In this study, physical nano-electronic networks with neuromorphic dynamics are investigated for their use as physical reservoirs in an RC framework. These neuromorphic networks operate as dynamic reservoirs, with node activities in general coupled to the edge dynamics through nonlinear nano-electronic circuit elements, and the reservoir outputs influenced by the underlying network connectivity structure. This study finds that networks with varying degrees of sparsity generate more useful nonlinear temporal outputs for dynamic RC compared to dense networks. Dynamic RC is also tested on an autonomous multivariate chaotic time series prediction task with networks of varying densities, which revealed the importance of network sparsity in maintaining network activity and overall dynamics, that in turn enabled the learning of the chaotic Lorenz63 system's attractor behavior.

Title: Active Quantum Reservoir Engineering: Using a Qubit to Manipulate its Environment
Authors: Marcelo Janovitch, Matteo Brunelli, Patrick P. Potts
Abstract: Quantum reservoir engineering leverages dissipative processes to achieve desired behavior, with applications ranging from entanglement generation to quantum error correction. Therein, a structured environment acts as an entropy sink for the system and no time-dependent control over the system is required. We develop a theoretical framework for active reservoir engineering, where time-dependent control over a quantum system is used to manipulate its environment. In this case, the system may act as an entropy sink for the environment. Our framwork captures the dynamical interplay between system and environment, and provides an intuitive picture of how finite-size effects and system-environment correlations allow for manipulating the environment by repeated initialization of the quantum system. We illustrate our results with two examples: a superconducting qubit coupled to an environment of two-level systems and a semiconducting quantum dot coupled to nuclear spins. In both scenarios, we find qualitative agreement with previous experimental results, illustrating how active control can unlock new functionalities in open quantum systems.

Title: Accurate crystal field Hamiltonians of single-ion magnets at mean-field cost
Authors: Linqing Peng, Shuanglong Liu, Xing Zhang, Xiao Chen, Chenghan Li, Hai-Ping Cheng, Garnet Kin-Lic Chan
Abstract: The effective crystal field Hamiltonian provides the key description of the electronic properties of single-ion magnets, but obtaining its parameters from ab initio computation is challenging. We introduce a simple approach to derive the effective crystal field Hamiltonian through density functional calculations of randomly rotated mean-field states within the low-energy manifold. In benchmarks on five lanthanide-based complexes, we find that we compute with mean-field cost an effective crystal field Hamiltonian that matches the state-of-the-art from much more expensive multi-configurational quantum chemistry methods. In addition, we are able to reproduce the experimental low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties with an accuracy exceeding prior attempts. Due to its low cost, our approach provides a crucial ingredient in the computational design of single-ion magnets with tailored physical properties and low-energy spectra.

Title: Exact Solutions and Quantum Defect Theory for van der Waals Potentials in Ultracold Molecular Systems
Authors: Jianwen Jie, Shi Chen, Yue Chen, Ran Qi
Abstract: In this paper, we have provided exact two-body solutions to the 2D and 3D Schrödinger equations with isotropic van der Waals potentials of the form \(\pm 1/r^6\). Based on these solutions, we developed an analytical quantum defect theory (QDT) applicable to both quasi-2D and 3D geometries, and applied it to study the scattering properties and bound-state spectra of ultracold polar molecules confined in these geometries. Interestingly, we find that in the attractive (repulsive) van der Waals potential case, the short-range interaction can be effectively modeled by an infinite square barrier (finite square well), which leads to narrow and dense (broad and sparse) resonance structures in the quantum defect parameter. In the quasi-2D attractive case, shape resonances can appear in an ordered fashion across different partial waves, characterized by sharp phase jumps as the scattering energy is varied. Furthermore, the low-energy analytical expansions derived from QDT show excellent agreement with the exact numerical results, validating the accuracy and usefulness of our analytical approach in describing two-body physics governed by long-range van der Waals interactions.

Title: Zero-bias conductance peaks at zero applied magnetic field due to stray fields from integrated micromagnets in hybrid nanowire quantum dots
Authors: Y. Jiang, M. Gupta, C. Riggert, M. Pendharkar, C. Dempsey, J.S. Lee, S.D. Harrington, C.J. Palmstrøm, V. S. Pribiag, S.M. Frolov
Abstract: Many recipes for realizing topological superconductivity rely on broken time-reversal symmetry, which is often attained by applying a substantial external magnetic field. Alternatively, using magnetic materials can offer advantages through low-field operation and design flexibility on the nanoscale. Mechanisms for lifting spin degeneracy include exchange coupling, spin-dependent scattering, spin injection-all requiring direct contact between the bulk or induced superconductor and a magnetic material. Here, we implement locally broken time-reversal symmetry through dipolar coupling from nearby micromagnets to superconductor-semiconductor hybrid nanowire devices. Josephson supercurrent is hysteretic due to micromangets switching. At or around zero external magnetic field, we observe an extended presence of Andreev bound states near zero voltage bias. We also show a zero-bias peak plateau of a non-quantized value. Our findings largely reproduce earlier results where similar effects were presented in the context of topological superconductivity in a homogeneous wire, and attributed to more exotic time-reversal breaking mechanisms [1]. In contrast, our stray field profiles are not designed to create Majorana modes, and our data are compatible with a straightforward interpretation in terms of trivial states in quantum dots. At the same time, the use of micromagnets in hybrid superconductor-semiconductor devices shows promise for future experiments on topological superconductivity.

Title: A Fourier Neural Operator Approach for Modelling Exciton-Polariton Condensate Systems
Authors: Yuan Wang, Surya T. Sathujoda, Krzysztof Sawicki, Kanishk Gandhi, Angelica I Aviles-Rivero, Pavlos G. Lagoudakis
Abstract: A plethora of next-generation all-optical devices based on exciton-polaritons have been proposed in latest years, including prototypes of transistors, switches, analogue quantum simulators and others. However, for such systems consisting of multiple polariton condensates, it is still challenging to predict their properties in a fast and accurate manner. The condensate physics is conventionally described by Gross-Pitaevskii equations (GPEs). While GPU-based solvers currently exist, we propose a significantly more efficient machine-learning-based Fourier neural operator approach to find the solution to the GPE coupled with exciton rate equations, trained on both numerical and experimental datasets. The proposed method predicts solutions almost three orders of magnitude faster than CUDA-based solvers in numerical studies, maintaining the high degree of accuracy. Our method not only accelerates simulations but also opens the door to faster, more scalable designs for all-optical chips and devices, offering profound implications for quantum computing, neuromorphic systems, and beyond.

Abstract: Materials that transition between metal and insulator, the two main states that distinguish all solids, are fascinating because they underlie many mysteries at the frontier of solid state physics. In 1T-TaS$_{2}$, the metal-insulator transition is linked to a metastable hidden state arising within a chiral charge density wave (CDW) whose basic nature remains an open question. In this work, we show that pulses of current through these materials create current-carrying filamentary channels that distinguish the 'metallic' hidden state and 'insulating' CDW states. These channels have remained dark to previous measurements, and yet are directly linked to the properties of the hidden state. We leverage the metastability of these conduction channels to demonstrate electrical control of their creation, erasure and location. Our findings show that physical elements, such as boundaries and interfaces, play a key role in the properties of the hidden state characterizing the metal-insulator transition. We suggest new possibilities for in-situ electrical design of synaptic components with possible applications to neuromorphic computing.

Title: Inducing a transition between thermal and many-body localized states and detecting many-body mobility edges through dissipation
Authors: Yutao Hu, Chao Yang, Yucheng Wang
Abstract: The many-body mobility edge (MBME) in energy, which separates thermal states from many-body localization (MBL) states, is a critical yet controversial concept in MBL physics. Here we examine the quasiperiodic $t_1-t_2$ model that features a mobility edge. With the addition of nearest-neighbor interactions, we suggest the potential existence of a MBME. Then we investigate the impact of a type of bond dissipation on the many-body system by calculating the steady-state density matrix and analyzing the transport behavior, and demonstrate that dissipation can cause the system to predominantly occupy either the thermal region or the MBL region, irrespective of the initial state. Finally, we discuss the effects of increasing system size. Our results indicate that dissipation can induce transitions between thermal and MBL states, providing a new approach for experimentally determining the existence of the MBME.

Title: Effects of curvature on growing films of microorganisms
Authors: Yuta Kuroda, Takeshi Kawasaki, Andreas M. Menzel
Abstract: To provide insight into the basic properties of emerging structures when bacteria or other microorganisms conquer surfaces, it is crucial to analyze their growth behavior during the formation of thin films. In this regard, many theoretical studies focus on the behavior of elongating straight objects. They repel each other through volume exclusion and divide into two halves when reaching a certain threshold length. However, in reality, hardly any object of a certain elongation is perfectly straight. Therefore, we here study the consequences of the curvature of individuals on the growth of colonies and thin active films. This individual curvature, so far hardly considered, turns out to qualitatively affect the overall growth behavior of the colony. Particularly, strings of stacked curved cells emerge that show branched structures, while the size of orientationally ordered domains in the colony is significantly decreased. Furthermore, we identify emergent spatio-orientational coupling that is not observed in colonies of straight cells. Our results are important for a fundamental understanding of the interaction and spreading of microorganisms on surfaces, with implications for medical applications and bioengineering.

Title: Inverted duality of Hubbard model and an equation for the Green's function
Authors: Xiao-Yong Feng
Abstract: The Hubbard model, a cornerstone in the field of condensed matter physics, serves as a fundamental framework for investigating the behavior of strongly correlated electron systems. This paper presents a novel perspective on the model, uncovering its inherent inverted duality which has profound implications for our comprehension of this complex system. Taking advantage of this special mathematical property, we have formulated an equation that the electron Green's function must satisfy. Our findings pave the way for further exploration and potentially new insights into the dynamics of electron correlations and phase transitions in the Hubbard model.

Title: The multi-state geometry of shift current and polarization
Authors: Alexander Avdoshkin, Johannes Mitscherling, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The quantum metric and Berry curvature capture essential properties of non-trivial Bloch states and underpin many fascinating phenomena. However, it becomes increasingly evident that a more comprehensive understanding of quantum state geometry is necessary to explain properties involving Bloch states of multiple bands, such as optical transitions. To this end, we employ quantum state projectors to develop an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism and demonstrate its power with applications to non-linear optics and the theory of electronic polarization. We provide a simple expression for the shift current that resolves its precise relation to the moments of electronic polarization, clarifies the treatment of band degeneracies, and reveals its decomposition into the sum of the skewness of the occupied states and intrinsically multi-state geometry. The projector approach is applied to calculate non-linear optical properties of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs) layers, using previously calculated minimal tight-binding models, and demonstrated analytically on a three-band generalization of the Rice-Mele chain to elucidate the different contributions. We close with comments on further applications of the projector operator approach to multi-state geometry.

Title: Kramers-Wannier self-duality and non-invertible translation symmetry in quantum chains: a wave-function perspective
Authors: Hua-Chen Zhang, Germán Sierra
Abstract: The Kramers-Wannier self-duality of critical quantum chains is examined from the perspective of model wave functions. We demonstrate, using the transverse-field Ising chain and the $3$-state Potts chain as examples, that the symmetry operator for the Kramers-Wannier self-duality follows in a simple and direct way from a `generalised' translation symmetry of the model wave function in the anyonic fusion basis. This translation operation, in turn, comprises a sequence of $F$-moves in the underlying fusion category. The symmetry operator thus obtained naturally admits the form of a matrix product operator and obeys non-invertible fusion rules. The findings reveal an intriguing connection between the (non-invertible) translation symmetry on the lattice and topological aspects of the conformal field theory describing the scaling limit.

Title: Intrinsic inverse band gap versus polarization relation in ferroelectric materials
Authors: Nicolás Forero-Correa, Nicolas Varas-Salinas, Tomás M. Castillo, Sebastian E. Reyes-Lillo
Abstract: Ferroelectric materials have promising applications in solar-energy conversion and electro-optic devices. The internal gradient fields produced by the macroscopic polarization may improve electronic and transport semiconducting properties. However, ferroelectrics tend to display relatively large band gaps and hence low solar-energy conversion efficiencies. In this work, we explore materials with an intrinsic inverse relation between band gap and polarization in a single ferroelectric phase. Ferroelectrics with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation are characterized by low density of states contribution at the conduction states and negligible orbital hybridization at the valence states. We use high-throughput and first principles methods to find 15 ferroelectric materials with an inverse band gap versus polarization relation in the Materials Project database. Our work provides a new pathway to design small-band gap large-polarization ferroelectrics, by simultaneously tailoring the band gap and polarization of ferroelectrics with an inverse relation through an external tuning parameter.

Title: Exploration of stable atomic configurations in graphene-like BCN systems by Bayesian optimization
Authors: Taichi Hara, Akira Kusaba, Yoshihiro Kangawa, Tetsuji Kuboyama, David Bowler, Karol Kawka, Pawel Kempisty
Abstract: h-BCN is an intriguing material system where the bandgap varies considerably depending on the atomic configuration, even at a fixed composition. Exploring stable atomic configurations in this system is crucial for discussing the energetic formability and controllability of desirable configurations. In this study, this challenge is tackled by combining first-principles calculations with Bayesian optimization. An encoding method that represents the configurations as vectors, while incorporating information about the local atomic environments and domain knowledge, is proposed for the search. The proposed encoding method proved effective in the search, resulting in the discovery of two interesting and stable semiconductor configurations. Furthermore, the optimization behavior is discussed through principal component analysis, confirming that the ordered BN network and the C configuration features are well embedded in the search space. While our approach provided a tailored encoding for the h-BCN system in this study, it holds promise for broader application to other materials by adapting the domain knowledge matrix to each target system.

Title: On the foundations of statistical mechanics
Authors: Marco Baldovin, Giacomo Gradenigo, Angelo Vulpiani, Nino Zanghì
Abstract: Although not as wide, and popular, as that of quantum mechanics, the investigation of fundamental aspects of statistical mechanics constitutes an important research field in the building of modern physics. Besides the interest for itself, both for physicists and philosophers, and the obvious pedagogical motivations, there is a further, compelling reason for a thorough understanding of the subject. The fast development of models and methods at the edge of the established domain of the field requires indeed a deep reflection on the essential aspects of the theory, which are at the basis of its success. These elements should never be disregarded when trying to expand the domain of statistical mechanics to systems with novel, little known features. It is thus important to (re)consider in a careful way the main ingredients involved in the foundations of statistical mechanics. Among those, a primary role is covered by the dynamical aspects (e.g. presence of chaos), the emergence of collective features for large systems, and the use of probability in the building of a consistent statistical description of physical systems. With this goal in mind, in the present review we aim at providing a consistent picture of the state of the art of the subject, both in the classical and in the quantum realm. In particular, we will highlight the similarities of the key technical and conceptual steps with emphasis on the relevance of the many degrees of freedom, to justify the use of statistical ensembles in the two domains.

Title: Renormalization of the optical band gap through an effective Thirring interaction for massive Dirac-like electrons
Authors: Nilberto Bezerra, Van Sérgio Alves, Leandro O. Nascimento, Luis Fernández
Abstract: We analyze mass renormalization in massive Dirac-like systems in (2+1) dimensions arising from electron-phonon interactions at finite temperatures, employing the large-$N$ expansion. Our model combines the low-energy description of charge carriers in a buckled honeycomb lattice with the low-energy approximation for phonons and electron-phonon interactions in two-dimensional materials. Consequently, the system is modeled as a massive Dirac-like field coupled to a two-component vector field $\mathcal{A}_i$, representing the phonon modes. This framework allows us to compute the one-loop electron self-energy at finite temperature, from which we derive the renormalized band gap, $m^R$. The effective model is subsequently applied to describe the renormalized optical band gap in monolayers of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), including MoS$_2$, MoSe$_2$, WS$_2$, and WSe$_2$. A good agreement is observed with experimental data for reasonable values of the ultraviolet cutoff, $\Lambda \approx 1$ eV. Our main findings indicate that $m^R$ remains nearly constant at low temperatures, whereas at higher temperatures it decreases linearly with the temperature $T$. Specifically, we find that $m^R$ reduces by approximately $\approx [0.1,0.2]$ eV as the temperature increases from $\approx 4$ K to $500$ K, consistent with recent experimental observations. Furthermore, we estimate the temperature range at which the transition to the linear regime occurs, obtaining typical values within $\approx [110,150]$ K for the four materials under consideration.

Title: Crystal to liquid cross-over for active particles with inverse-square power-law interaction
Authors: Saikat Santra, Leo Touzo, Chandan Dasgupta, Abhishek Dhar, Suman Dutta, Anupam Kundu, Pierre Le Doussal, Gregory Schehr, Prashant Singh
Abstract: We consider a one-dimensional system comprising of $N$ run-and-tumble particles confined in a harmonic trap interacting via a repulsive inverse-square power-law interaction. We numerically compute the global density profile in the steady state which shows interesting crossovers between three different regimes: as the activity increases, we observe a change from a density with sharp peaks characteristic of a crystal region to a smooth bell-shaped density profile, passing through the intermediate stage of a smooth Wigner semi-circle characteristic of a liquid phase. We also investigate analytically the crossover between the crystal and the liquid regions by computing the covariance of the positions of these particles in the steady state in the weak noise limit. It is achieved by using the method introduced in Touzo {\it et al.} [Phys. Rev. E {\bf 109}, 014136 (2024)] to study the active Dyson Brownian motion. Our analytical results are corroborated by thorough numerical simulations.

Title: Solving and visualizing fractional quantum Hall wavefunctions with neural network
Authors: Yi Teng, David D. Dai, Liang Fu
Abstract: We introduce an attention-based fermionic neural network (FNN) to variationally solve the problem of two-dimensional Coulomb electron gas in magnetic fields, a canonical platform for fractional quantum Hall (FQH) liquids, Wigner crystals and other unconventional electron states. Working directly with the full Hilbert space of $N$ electrons confined to a disk, our FNN consistently attains energies lower than LL-projected exact diagonalization (ED) and learns the ground state wavefunction to high accuracy. In low LL mixing regime, our FNN reveals microscopic features in the short-distance behavior of FQH wavefunction beyond the Laughlin ansatz. For moderate and strong LL mixing parameters, the FNN outperforms ED significantly. Moreover, a phase transition from FQH liquid to a crystal state is found at strong LL mixing. Our study demonstrates unprecedented power and universality of FNN based variational method for solving strong-coupling many-body problems with topological order and electron fractionalization.

Title: Defect-induced spin textures in magnetic solids
Authors: M. E. Zhitomirsky, Vijay B. Shenoy, Roderich Moessner
Abstract: Vacancy defects in isotropic noncollinear antiferromagnets produce long-range spin textures. By developing a "magnetic elasticity theory", we demonstrate that a vacancy-induced readjustment in the spin configuration decays algebraically with distance. The power law exponent depends on the multipole moment of a local spin deformation, which in turn is determined by the lattice symmetry and an equilibrium spin configuration in the absence of defects. The role of these two factors is highlighted for the J1-J2 Heisenberg model on a kagome lattice. A vacancy in this model generates spin deformations that decay as 1/r^2 for the q=0 ground state and as a 1/r for the sqrt{3} x sqrt{3} magnetic structure. The analytic conclusions are confirmed by extensive numerical simulations. We also compute the fractional magnetic moments associated with vacancies and other lattice defects. Our results shed light on relative fragility of different magnetic structures with respect to spin glass formation at higher doping levels.

Title: Gauge-invariant projector calculus for quantum state geometry and applications to observables in crystals
Authors: Johannes Mitscherling, Alexander Avdoshkin, Joel E. Moore
Abstract: The importance of simple geometrical invariants, such as the Berry curvature and quantum metric, constructed from the Bloch states of a crystal has become well-established over four decades of research. More complex aspects of geometry emerge in properties linking multiple bands, such as optical responses. In the companion work [arXiv:2409.16358], we identified novel multi-state geometrical invariants using an explicitly gauge-invariant formalism based on projection operators, which we used to clarify the relation between the shift current and the theory of electronic polarization among other advancements for second-order non-linear optics. Here, we provide considerably more detail on the projector formalism and the geometrical invariants arising in the vicinity of a specific value of crystal momentum. We combine the introduction to multi-state quantum geometry with broadly relevant algebraic relationships and detailed example calculations, enabling extensions toward future applications to topological and geometrical properties of insulators and metals.

Title: Supervised and unsupervised learning of the many-body critical phase, phase transitions, and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems
Authors: Aamna Ahmed, Nilanjan Roy
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.

Title: Boundary operator expansion and extraordinary phase transition in the tricritical O(N) model
Authors: Xinyu Sun, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: We study the boundary extraordinary transition of a three-dimensional (3D) tricritical $O(N)$ model. We first compute the mean-field Green's function with a general coupling of $|\vec \phi|^{2n}$ (with $n=3$ corresponding to the tricritical model) at the extraordinary phase transition. Then, using layer susceptibility, we obtain the boundary operator expansion for the transverse and longitudinal modes within the $\epsilon=3 - d$ expansion. Based on these results, we demonstrate that the tricritical point exhibits an extraordinary transition characterized by an ordered boundary for any $N$. This provides the first nontrivial example of continuous symmetry breaking in 2D in the context of boundary criticality.

Title: Integer Quantum Hall Effect: Disorder, temperature, floating, and plateau width
Authors: Stuart Yi-Thomas, Yi Huang, Jay D. Sau, Sankar Das Sarma
Abstract: We theoretically consider disorder and temperature effects on the integer quantum Hall effect (IQHE) using a variety of distinct and complementary analytical and numerical techniques. In particular, we address simple, physical, and experimentally relevant questions: How does disorder and/or temperature affect the IQHE plateau width? Does the plateau width increase or decrease with disorder and/or temperature? What happens to the peak in the longitudinal conductance with increasing disorder/temperature? Does the longitudinal conductance obey any universal scaling property? Is there "floating" with increasing disorder and/or decreasing magnetic field? Can disorder destroy the IQHE? Is there an IQHE to localization transition? What is the Landau level dependence of the plateau width? Our detailed theory provides answers to these and other related experimentally relevant questions. We discuss our results in the context of existing experimental results and suggest future experiments arising from our work. A key finding is that disorder and temperature are intrinsically connected in affecting IQHE, and there is an intricate interplay between them leading to nonmonotonicity in how the IQHE plateau width behaves as a function of increasing disorder. Both must be considered on an equal footing in understanding IQHE experiments.

Title: Quantum valley pseudospin controlled by strain
Authors: Maurício F. C. Martins Quintela, Miguel Sá, Alejandro J. Uría-Álvarez, Mikhail Malakhov, Giovanni Cistaro, Jorge Quereda, Juan J. Palacios, Antonio Picón
Abstract: Valleytronics, as an alternative to traditional electronics or spintronics, is based on the encoding of quantum information in pseudospin valley quantum numbers, rather than in charge or spin states. A key ingredient is the (optical) manipulation of valley states before loss of coherence, which can be as fast as 100 femtoseconds. Previous works have shown the possibility of valley state manipulation using external fields. Here we propose uniaxial strain as a more flexible and robust scheme to manipulate the valley state through the breaking of the crystal symmetry and the concomitant lifting of the degeneracy of the 1s exciton energy. Our theory is corroborated by state-of-the-art numerical simulations in monolayer hBN and shows the possibility to control valley pseudospin at the attosecond time scale.

Title: Small hole polarons in yellow phase $δ$-CsPbI$_3$
Authors: Yun Liu
Abstract: A heterophase containing both the optically active $\alpha$-CsPbI$_3$ and non-active $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ has been demonstrated as an efficient white light emitter. This has challenged the conventional perspective that non-active phases of perovskites are undesirable in any perovskite-based optoelectronic devices. To understand the role that the yellow phase $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ plays in the light emission process, we performed a systematic computational study on its electronic and optical properties, which are relatively unexplored in the literature. Using the Fröhlich model we showed that the electron and hole both exhibit moderate coupling to longitudinal optical phonons. Explicit density functional theory calculations show that small hole polarons exist with a formation energy of -96 meV, corresponding to the contraction of the Pb-I bonds within a [PbI$_6$] octahedra and wavefunction localization. Molecular dynamics simulations showed that the small hole polaron is stable against thermal disorder, and exhibit periodic localization and delocalization behavior similar to carrier hopping with a characteristic lifetime of 0.3 ps. Our results might have elucidated the role that $\delta$-CsPbI$_3$ play in the self-trapped emission in perovskite-based white light emitting diodes by supporting the presence of a localized small hole polaron.

Title: Thermodynamic entropic uncertainty relation
Authors: Yoshihiko Hasegawa, Tomohiro Nishiyama
Abstract: Thermodynamic uncertainty relations reveal a fundamental trade-off between the precision of a trajectory observable and entropy production, where the uncertainty of the observable is quantified by its variance. In information theory, Shannon entropy is a common measure of uncertainty. However, a clear quantitative relationship between the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production in stochastic thermodynamics remains to be established. In this Letter, we show that an uncertainty relation can be formulated in terms of the Shannon entropy of an observable and the entropy production. We introduce symmetry entropy, an entropy measure that quantifies the symmetry of the observable distribution, and demonstrate that a greater asymmetry in the observable distribution requires higher entropy production. Specifically, we establish that the sum of the entropy production and the symmetry entropy cannot be less than $\ln 2$. As a corollary, we also prove that the sum of the entropy production and the Shannon entropy of the observable is no less than $\ln 2$. As an application, we demonstrate our relation in the diffusion decision model, revealing a fundamental trade-off between decision accuracy and entropy production in stochastic decision-making processes.

Title: Chirality-induced Spin-Orbit Coupling and Spin Selectivity
Authors: Massimiliano Di Ventra, Rafael Gutierrez, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: We show that a spinor traveling along a helical path develops a spin-orbit coupling because of the curvature of the path. We then estimate the magnitude of this effective geometric spin-orbit interaction for structures that showcase chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS). We find that this chirality-induced spin-orbit coupling ($\chi$-SOC), in conjunction with broken time-reversal symmetry, may be an important ingredient for the microscopic underpinning of the CISS phenomenon.

Authors: Rintaro Masaoka, Tomohiro Soejima, Haruki Watanabe
Abstract: We study the kinetic Ising model under Glauber dynamics and establish an upper bound on the spectral gap for finite systems. This bound implies the critical exponent inequality $z \geq 2$, thereby rigorously improving the previously known estimate $z \geq 2 - \eta$. Our proof relies on the mapping from stochastic processes to frustration-free quantum systems and leverages the Simon--Lieb and Gosset--Huang inequalities.

Abstract: We present a quantum response approach to momentum-space gravity in dissipative multiband systems, which dresses both the quantum geometry--through an interband Weyl transformation--and the equations of motion. In addition to clarifying the roles of the contorsion and symplectic terms, we introduce the three-state quantum geometric tensor and discuss the significance of the emergent terms from a gravitational point of view. We also identify a dual quantum geometric drag force in momentum space that provides an entropic source term for the multiband matrix of Einstein field equations.

Title: Error Bounds on the Universal Lindblad Equation in the Thermodynamic Limit
Authors: Teruhiro Ikeuchi, Takashi Mori
Abstract: It is a central problem in various fields of physics to elucidate the behavior of quantum many-body systems subjected to bulk dissipation. In this context, several microscopic derivations of the Lindblad quantum master equation for many-body systems have been proposed so far. Among them, the universal Lindblad equation derived by Nathan and Rudner is fascinating because it has desired locality and its derivation seems to rely solely on the assumption that the bath correlation time is much shorter than the dissipation time, which is the case in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit. However, it remains elusive whether errors due to several approximations in deriving the universal Lindblad equation keep small during the time evolution in the thermodynamic limit. Here, rigorous error bounds on the time evolution of a local quantity are given, and it is shown that, under the assumption of the accelerated dissipation in bulk-dissipated systems, those errors vanish in the weak-coupling limit or the singular-coupling limit after taking the thermodynamic limit.

Title: Semisuper Efimov effect induced by resonant pair exchange in mixed dimensions
Authors: Yusuke Nishida
Abstract: We introduce a new member to the class of semisuper Efimov effects, where an infinite number of bound states emerge with their binding energies obeying the universal scaling law $E_n\sim e^{-2(\pi n/\gamma)^2}$ for sufficiently high excitation $n\in\mathbb{N}$. Our system consists of a pair of two-component fermions in three dimensions at infinite scattering length, which furthermore interact with a boson confined in two dimensions so as to form a three-body bound state at zero energy. When another boson is added, the exchange of the resonant pair of fermions between two bosons leads to the semisuper Efimov effect of four such particles with the scaling exponent $\gamma$ determined by the mass ratio of bosons to fermions. If bosons exist in three dimensions, an infinite number of bound states do not emerge, but some of them may survive for a large mass ratio, making our findings potentially relevant to two-neutron halo nuclei as well as ultracold atoms.

Title: Fate of Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless Paired Phase in Coupled $XY$ Models
Authors: Tianning Xiao, Youjin Deng, Xiao-Yu Dong
Abstract: Intriguing phases may emerge when two-dimensional systems are coupled in a bilayer configuration. In particular, a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless (BKT) paired superfluid phase was predicted and claimed to be numerically observed in a coupled $XY$ model with ferromagnetic interlayer interactions, as reported in [\href{this https URL}{Phys. Rev. Lett. 123, 100601 (2019)}]. However, both our Monte Carlo simulations and analytical analysis show that this model does not exhibit a BKT paired phase. We then propose a new model incorporating four-body interlayer interactions to realize the BKT paired phase. Moreover, we observe that the anomalous magnetic dimension varies along the phase transition line between the disordered normal phase and the BKT paired phase. This finding requires an understanding beyond the conventional phase transition theory.

Title: PolyConf: Unlocking Polymer Conformation Generation through Hierarchical Generative Models
Authors: Fanmeng Wang, Wentao Guo, Qi Ou, Hongshuai Wang, Haitao Lin, Hongteng Xu, Zhifeng Gao
Abstract: Polymer conformation generation is a critical task that enables atomic-level studies of diverse polymer materials. While significant advances have been made in designing conformation generation methods for small molecules and proteins, these methods struggle to generate polymer conformations due to their unique structural characteristics. Meanwhile, the scarcity of polymer conformation datasets further limits the progress, making this important area largely unexplored. In this work, we propose PolyConf, a pioneering tailored polymer conformation generation method that leverages hierarchical generative models to unlock new possibilities. Specifically, we decompose the polymer conformation into a series of local conformations (i.e., the conformations of its repeating units), generating these local conformations through an autoregressive model, and then generating their orientation transformations via a diffusion model to assemble them into the complete polymer conformation. Moreover, we develop the first benchmark with a high-quality polymer conformation dataset derived from molecular dynamics simulations to boost related research in this area. The comprehensive evaluation demonstrates that PolyConf consistently outperforms existing conformation generation methods, thus facilitating advancements in polymer modeling and simulation.

Title: Systematic construction of asymptotic quantum many-body scar states and their relation to supersymmetric quantum mechanics
Authors: Masaya Kunimi, Yusuke Kato, Hosho Katsura
Abstract: We develop a systematic method for constructing asymptotic quantum many-body scar (AQMBS) states. While AQMBS states are closely related to quantum many-body scar (QMBS) states, they exhibit key differences. Unlike QMBS states, AQMBS states are not energy eigenstates of the Hamiltonian, making their construction more challenging. We demonstrate that, under appropriate conditions, AQMBS states can be obtained as low-lying gapless excited states of a parent Hamiltonian, which has a QMBS state as its ground state. Furthermore, our formalism reveals a connection between QMBS and supersymmetric (SUSY) quantum mechanics. The QMBS state can be interpreted as a SUSY-unbroken ground state.

Title: Geometric Quantum Thermodynamic Engine under an Isothermal Operation: An Application of a Thouless Pumping
Authors: Ryosuke Yoshii, Hisao Hayakawa
Abstract: We present a geometric formalism for the non-equilibrium thermodynamics of a small system coupled to external isothermal reservoirs as an application of Thouless pumping, where the electrochemical potentials of the reservoirs and parameters in the system's Hamiltonian are adiabatically controlled. By analyzing the quantum master equation for the Anderson model of a quantum dot under the wide-band approximation, we obtain the work and effective efficiency of the thermodynamic engine as functions of the phase difference between the externally controlled electrochemical potentials after the system reaches a geometric cyclic state. Since the entropy production is negligible in adiabatic operations, the process we consider is reversible, analogous to the Carnot cycle.

Title: Soft superconductivity in covalent bismuth dihydride BiH$_2$ under extreme conditions
Authors: Jianning Guo, Dmitrii V. Semenok, Ivan A. Troyan, Di Zhou, Yulong Wang, Yuzhi Chen, Su Chen, Kexin Zhang, Xinyue Wu, Sven Luther, Toni Helm, Andrey V Sadakov, Alexey S. Usoltsev, Leonid A Morgun, Vladimir M Pudalov, Viktor V Struzhkin, Xiaoli Huang
Abstract: Strong magnetic fields provide a unique environment for investigating the fundamental properties of superconducting materials, especially for hydride superconductors with large upper critical fields. Following this idea, we have investigated the effect of pulsed magnetic fields on covalent bismuth dihydride (BiH$_2$), successfully synthesized under pressure up to 211 GPa. The electrical resistance measurements indicate that the superconducting phase $P2_1/m$-BiH$_2$ exhibits the highest superconducting critical temperature ($T_c$) of 70 K among MH$_2$-type hydride apart from H$_2$S. The electrical transport experiments under both pulsed (up to 50 T) and steady magnetic fields (up to 16 T) for $P2_1/m$- and $C2/m$-BiH$_2$ indicate that the upper critical fields $\mu_0 H_{c2}(0)$ = 12--16 T are unusually low, much lower than that of clathrate-like metal polyhydrides with similar $T_c$. This is due to the unexpectedly high Fermi velocity in BiH$_2$, about $1.1 \times 10^6$ m/s, which allows to classify BiH$_2$ as a 'soft' molecular superconducting hydride with relatively weak vortex pinning. Measurements of the current-voltage characteristics in the pulsed mode make it possible to experimentally establish the temperature dependence of the critical current density (the maximum $J_c(0) = 10$ kA/mm$^2$), which indicates the presence of two $s$-wave superconducting gaps in BiH$_2$ at 172--176 GPa: $\Delta_L(0) = 6.9 \pm 1.2$ meV and $\Delta_S(0) \sim 1.5$ meV.

Title: Emergence of the electronic states by quantum charge fluctuations in electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductors
Authors: Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Yudai Miyai, Yuki. Tsubota, Masashi Atira, Hitoshi Sato, Dongjoon Song, Kiyoshia Tanakae, Kenya Shimada, Shin-ichiro Ideta
Abstract: The origin of electron-boson interactions is a key to understanding the mechanism of high-$T_c$ superconductivity in cuprates. While interactions with phonons and magnetic fluctuations are widely considered to mediate electron pairing in cuprates, the role of charge fluctuations, which is one of the fundamental degrees of freedom, remains unclear. Here, we performed angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) and angle-resolved inverse photoemission spectroscopy (AR-IPES) to investigate the electronic structure of the occupied and unoccupied states, respectively, in the electron-doped high-$T_c$ cuprate superconductor Nd$_{2-x}$Ce$_x$CuO$_4$. We found emergent spectral features in both the occupied (ARPES) and unoccupied states (AR-IPES), which are likely induced by charge fluctuations. The present study paves the way for a deeper understanding of the relationship between quantum charge fluctuations and superconductivity.

Abstract: We study electrical, thermal and thermoelectric transport in a hybrid device consisting of a long-range Kitaev chain coupled to two metallic leads at two ends. Electrical and thermal currents are calculated in this device under both voltage and thermal bias conditions. We find that the transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev chain are distinguishably different from its short-range counterpart, which is well known for hosting zero energy Majorana edge modes under some specific range of values of the model parameters. The emergence of massive Dirac fermions, the absence of gap closing at the topological phase transition point and some special features of the energy spectrum which are unique to the long-range Kitaev chain, significantly alter electrical/thermal current vs. voltage/temperature bias characteristics in comparison with that of the short-range Kitaev chain. These novel transport characteristics of the long-range Kitaev model can be helpful in understanding nontrivial topological phases of the long-range Kitaev chain.

Title: Polaromechanics: cavity-magnon polaritons strongly coupled to phonons
Authors: Rui-Chang Shen, Jie Li, Yi-Ming Sun, Wei-Jiang Wu, Xuan Zuo, Yi-Pu Wang, Shi-Yao Zhu, J. Q. You
Abstract: Building hybrid quantum systems is a crucial step for realizing multifunctional quantum technologies, quantum information processing, and hybrid quantum networks. A functional hybrid quantum system requires strong coupling among its components. However, couplings between distinct physical systems are typically very weak. Experimental realization of strong coupling in a hybrid system remains a long-standing challenge, especially when it has multiple components and the components are of different nature. Here we demonstrate the realization of triple strong coupling in a novel {\it polaromechanical} hybrid system, where polaritons, formed by strongly coupled ferromagnetic magnons and microwave photons, are further strongly coupled to phonons. The corresponding polaromechanical normal-mode splitting is observed. A high polaromechanical cooperativity of $9.4\times10^3$ is achieved by significantly reducing the polariton decay rate via exploiting coherent perfect absorption. The quantum cooperativity much greater than unity is achievable if placing the system at cryogenic temperatures, which would enable various quantum applications. Our results pave the way towards coherent quantum control of photons, magnons and phonons, and are a crucial step for building functional hybrid quantum systems based on magnons.

Title: Pair Production in time-dependent Electric field at Finite times
Authors: Deepak Sah, Manoranjan P. Singh
Abstract: We investigate the finite-time behavior of pair production from the vacuum by a time-dependent Sauter pulsed electric field. By examining the temporal behavior of the single-particle distribution function, we observe oscillatory patterns in the longitudinal momentum spectrum of the particles at finite times. These oscillations arise due to quantum interference effects resulting from the various dynamical processes/channels leading to the creation of the (quasi-)particle of a given momentum. Furthermore, we derive an approximate and simplified analytical expression for the distribution function at finite times, allowing us to explain these oscillations' origin and behavior. The role of the vacuum polarization function and its counterterm are also discussed in this regard. The transverse momentum spectrum peaked at the nonzero value of the transverse momentum at finite times, which indicates the role of multiphoton transitions in the creation of quasiparticles.

Title: Bosonization and Anomaly Indicators of (2+1)-D Fermionic Topological Orders
Authors: Arun Debray, Weicheng Ye, Matthew Yu
Abstract: We provide a mathematical proposal for the anomaly indicators of symmetries of (2+1)-d fermionic topological orders, and work out the consequences of our proposal in several nontrivial examples. Our proposal is an invariant of a super modular tensor category with a fermionic group action, which gives a (3+1)-d topological field theory (TFT) that we conjecture to be invertible; the anomaly indicators are partition functions of this TFT on $4$-manifolds generating the corresponding twisted spin bordism group. Our construction relies on a bosonization construction due to Gaiotto-Kapustin and Tata-Kobayashi-Bulmash-Barkeshli, together with a ``bosonization conjecture'' which we explain in detail. In the second half of the paper, we discuss several examples of our invariants relevant to condensed-matter physics. The most important example we consider is $\mathbb{Z}/4^T\times \mathbb{Z}/2^f$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^FC$, which many fermionic topological orders enjoy, including the $\mathrm{U}(1)_5$ spin Chern-Simons theory. Using newly developed tools involving the Smith long exact sequence, we calculate the cobordism group that classifies its anomaly, present the generating manifold, and calculate the partition function on the generating manifold which serves as our anomaly indicator. Our approach allows us to reproduce anomaly indicators known in the literature with simpler proofs, including $\mathbb{Z}/4^{Tf}$ time-reversal symmetry with symmetry algebra $\mathcal T^2 = (-1)^F$, and other symmetry groups in the 10-fold way involving Lie group symmetries.

Title: Hamiltonian for a Bose gas with Contact Interactions
Authors: Daniele Ferretti, Alessandro Teta
Abstract: We study the Hamiltonian for a three-dimensional Bose gas of $N \geq 3$ spinless particles interacting via zero-range (also known as contact) interactions. Such interactions are encoded by (singular) boundary conditions imposed on the coincidence hyperplanes, i.e., when the coordinates of two particles coincide. It is well known that imposing the same kind of boundary conditions as in the two-body problem with a point interaction leads to a Hamiltonian unbounded from below (and thus unstable). This is due to the fact that the interaction becomes overly strong and attractive when the coordinates of three or more particles coincide. In order to avoid such instability, we develop a suggestion originally formulated by Minlos and Faddeev in 1962, introducing slightly modified boundary conditions that weaken the strength of the interaction between two particles $i$ and $j$ in two scenarios: (a) a third particle approaches the common position of $i$ and $j$; (b) another distinct pair of particles approach each other. In all other cases, the usual boundary condition is restored. Using a quadratic form approach, we construct a class of Hamiltonians characterized by such modified boundary conditions, that are self-adjoint and bounded from below. We also compare our approach with the one developed years ago by Albeverio, Høegh-Krohn and Streit using the theory of Dirichlet forms (J. Math. Phys., 18, 907--917, 1977). In particular, we show that the $N$-body Hamiltonian defined by Albeverio et al. is a special case of our class of Hamiltonians. Furthermore, we also introduce a Dirichlet form by considering a more general weight function, and we prove that the corresponding $N$-body Hamiltonians essentially coincide with those constructed via our method.

Title: Classically Frustrated Magnets, Symmetries and $\mathbb Z_2$-Equivariant Topology
Authors: Shayan Zahedi
Abstract: A novel result in $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant homotopy theory is stated, proven, and applied to the topological classification of classically frustrated magnets in the presence of canonical time-reversal symmetry. This result generalizes a lemma that had been key to the homotopical derivation of the renowned Bott-Kitaev periodic table for topological insulators and superconductors. The methods used in the classification of topological insulators and superconductors are here generalized and their generalizations applied to systems that are not quantum mechanical. We distinguish between three symmetry classes $\mathrm{AIII}$, $\mathrm{BDI}$, and $\mathrm{CII}$ depending on the existence and type of canonical time-reversal symmetry. For each of these classes, the relevant objects to classify are $\mathbb Z_2$-equivariant maps into a Stiefel manifold. The topological classification is illustrated through examples of classically frustrated spin models and is compared to that of Roychowdhury and Lawler (RL).

Title: Entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlators, and pole skipping
Authors: Banashree Baishya, Adrita Chakraborty, Nibedita Padhi
Abstract: We investigate two salient chaotic features, namely Lyapunov exponent and butterfly velocity, for an asymptotically Lifshitz black hole background with arbitrary dynamical critical exponent. These features are computed using three methods: entanglement wedge method, out-of-time-ordered correlator computation and pole-skipping. We present a comparative study where all of these methods yield exactly similar results for the butterfly velocity and Lyapunov exponent. This establishes an equivalence between all three methods for probing chaos in the chosen gravity background. Furthermore, we evaluate the chaos at the classical level by computing the eikonal phase and Lyapunov exponent from the bulk gravity. In the classical approach, we comment on potential limitations while choosing the turning point of the null geodesic in our gravity background. All chaotic properties emerge as nontrivial functions of the anisotropy index. By examining the classical eikonal phase, we uncover different scattering scenarios in the near-horizon and near-boundary regimes. Finally, we remark on a possible classical/quantum correspondence from the analysis of classical eikonal phase shift and Lyapunov exponent.

Title: Renormalisation of Quantum Cellular Automata
Authors: Lorenzo Siro Trezzini, Alessandro Bisio, Paolo Perinotti
Abstract: We study a coarse-graining procedure for quantum cellular automata on hypercubic lattices that consists in grouping neighboring cells into tiles and selecting a subspace within each tile. This is done in such a way that multiple evolution steps applied to this subspace can be viewed as a single evolution step of a new quantum cellular automaton, whose cells are the subspaces themselves. We derive a necessary and sufficient condition for renormalizability and use it to investigate the renormalization flow of cellular automata on a line, where the cells are qubits and the tiles are composed of two neighboring cells. The problem is exhaustively solved, and the fixed points of the renormalization flow are highlighted.

Title: Ultralow loss torsion micropendula for chipscale gravimetry
Authors: C. A. Condos, J. R. Pratt, J. Manley, A. R. Agrawal, S. Schlamminger, C. M. Pluchar, D. J. Wilson
Abstract: We explore a new class of chipscale torsion pendula formed by Si$_3$N$_4$ nanoribbon suspensions. Owing to their unique hierarchy of gravitational, tensile, and elastic stiffness, the devices exhibit damping rates of $\sim 10\;\mu$Hz and parametric gravity sensitivities near that of an ideal pendulum. The suspension nonlinearity can also be used to cancel the pendulum nonlinearity, paving the way towards fully isochronous, high $Q$ pendulum gravimeters. As a demonstration, we study a 0.1 mg, 32 Hz micropendulum with a damping rate of $16\;\mu$Hz, a thermal acceleration sensitivity of $2\;\text{n}g/\sqrt{\text{Hz}}$, and a parametric gravity sensitivity of $5$ Hz/$g_0$. We record Allan deviations as low as 2.5 $\mu$Hz at 100 seconds, corresponding to a bias stability of $5\times 10^{-7}g_0$. We also demonstrate a 100-fold cancellation of the pendulum nonlinearity. In addition to inertial sensing, our devices are well suited to proposed searches for new physics exploiting low-loss micro- to milligram-scale mechanical oscillators.

Title: Use of Electron Paramagnetic resonance (EPR) technique to build quantum computers: n-qubit (n=1,2,3,4) Toffoli Gates
Authors: Sayan Manna, Sushil K. Misra
Abstract: It is shown theoretically how to use the EPR (Electron Paramagnetic Resonance) technique, using electron spins as qubits, coupled with each other by the exchange interaction, to set the configuration of n qubits (n=1,2,3,4) at resonance, in conjunction with pulses, to construct the NOT (one qubit), CNOT (two qubits), CCNOT (three qubits), CCCNOT (four qubits) Toffoli gates, which can be exploited to build a quantum computer. This is unique to EPR, wherein exchange-coupled electron spins are used. This is not possible with NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance), that uses nuclear spins as qubits, which do not couple with each other by the exchange interaction.

Title: Electrical and Structural Properties of In-Situ MOCVD Grown Al$_2$O$_3$/$β$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$β$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs
Authors: A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan, Lingyu Meng, Dong Su Yu, Sushovan Dhara, Hsien-Lien Huang, Vijay Gopal Thirupakuzi Vangipuram, Jinwoo Hwang, Siddharth Rajan, Hongping Zhao
Abstract: This study investigates the electrical and structural properties of MOSCAPs with in-situ MOCVD-grown Al$_2$O$_3$ dielectrics on (010) $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ films. The Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs showed a strong dependence on Al$_2$O$_3$ deposition temperature. At 900$^\circ$C, reduced voltage hysteresis ($\sim$0.3 V) and improved reverse breakdown voltage (74.5 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 5.01 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 4.11 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. At 650$^\circ$C, higher hysteresis ($\sim$3.44 V) and lower reverse breakdown voltage (38.8 V) were observed, with breakdown fields of 3.69 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$ and 2.87 MV/cm in $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. However, forward breakdown fields improved from 5.62 MV/cm (900$^\circ$C) to 7.25 MV/cm (650$^\circ$C). STEM revealed improved crystallinity and sharper interfaces at 900$^\circ$C, enhancing reverse breakdown performance. For Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs, increasing Al composition ($x$ = 5.5\% to 9.2\%) reduced carrier concentration and improved reverse breakdown fields from 2.55 to 2.90 MV/cm in $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ and 2.41 to 3.13 MV/cm in Al$_2$O$_3$. Forward breakdown fields in Al$_2$O$_3$ improved from 5.0 to 5.4 MV/cm as Al composition increased. STEM confirmed compositional homogeneity and excellent stoichiometry of Al$_2$O$_3$ and $\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ layers. These findings highlight the robust electrical performance, high breakdown fields, and structural quality of Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$ and Al$_2$O$_3$/$\beta$-(Al$_x$Ga$_{1-x}$)$_2$O$_3$ MOSCAPs for high-power applications.

Title: Emergent clogging of continuum particle suspensions in constricted channels
Authors: Anushka Herale, Philip Pearce, Duncan Hewitt
Abstract: Particle suspensions in confined geometries can become clogged, which can have a catastrophic effect on function in biological and industrial systems. Here, we investigate the macroscopic dynamics of suspensions in constricted geometries. We develop a minimal continuum two-phase model that allows for variation in particle volume fraction. The model comprises a ``wet solid'' phase with material properties dependent on the particle volume fraction, and a seepage Darcy flow of fluid through the particles. We find that spatially varying geometry (or material properties) can induce emergent heterogeneity in the particle fraction and trigger the abrupt transition to a high-particle-fraction ``clogged'' state.

Title: Spin photonic topological metasurface based on kagome lattice and leaky-wave application
Authors: Sayyed Ahmad Abtahi, Mohsen Maddahali, Ahmad Bakhtafrouz
Abstract: The emerging field of topological metasurfaces offers unique advantages, particularly in robustness against backscattering in low-profile structures. The lattice configuration of these structures significantly influences the ability to achieve sharp turns in the propagation path. One of the most studied lattices in condensed matter physics is the kagome lattice, characterized by its hexagonal Brillouin zone, which displays a Dirac cone in its dispersion diagram. Previous research on kagome lattices in photonic topological insulators has primarily focused on valley types of insulators. This article introduces a spin topological metasurface based on the kagome lattice and its unit cell, enabling a broad range of sharp turns and propagation paths. The unit cell is compared to its hexagonal and 60-degree rhombic counterparts, and a parametric study of its dimensions is conducted. As a result of this research, a new X-band leaky-wave antenna designed in the kagome lattice with an armchair arrangement interface has been developed. This antenna provides two forward and two backward beams, each pair achieving an approximately 50-degree scan within the 8.8 to 11.1 GHz bandwidth.

Title: Adiabatic Gauge Potential as a Tool for Detecting Chaos in Classical Systems
Authors: Nachiket Karve, Nathan Rose, David Campbell
Abstract: The interplay between chaos and thermalization in weakly non-integrable systems is a rich and complex subject. Interest in this area is further motivated by a desire to develop a unified picture of chaos for both quantum and classical systems. In this work, we study the adiabatic gauge potential (AGP), an object typically studied in quantum mechanics that describes deformations of a quantum state under adiabatic variation of the Hamiltonian, in classical Fermi-Pasta-Ulam-Tsingou (FPUT) and Toda models. We show how the time variance of the AGP over a trajectory probes the long-time correlations of a generic observable and can be used to distinguish among nearly integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. We draw connections between the evolution of the AGP and diffusion and derive a fluctuation-dissipation relation that connects its variance to long-time correlations of the observable. Within this framework, we demonstrate that strongly and weakly chaotic regimes correspond to normal and anomalous diffusion, respectively. The latter gives rise to a marked increase in the variance as the time interval is increased, and this behavior serves as the basis for our probe of the onset times of chaos, which is interpreted as a ``mixing" time. Numerical results are presented for FPUT and Toda systems that highlight integrable, weakly chaotic, and strongly chaotic regimes. Further, a hierarchy of $t_{\text{Lyapunov}} < t_{\text{chaos}} < t_{\text{thermalization}}$ is found in these models. We conclude by commenting on the wide applicability of our method to a broader class of systems.

Title: Multi-Timescale Coherent Control via Quantum Averaging Theory for High-Fidelity Gate Operations
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a two-timescale quantum averaging theory (QAT) for analytically modeling unitary dynamics in driven quantum systems. Combining the unitarity-preserving Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT addresses the simultaneous presence of distinct timescales by generating a rotating frame with a dynamical phase operator that toggles with the high-frequency dynamics and yields an effective Hamiltonian for the slow degree of freedom. By retaining the fast-varying effects, we demonstrate the high precision achievable by applying this analytic technique to model a high-fidelity two-qubit quantum gate beyond the validity of first-order approximations. The results rapidly converge with numerical calculations of a fast-entangling Mølmer-Sørensen trapped-ion-qubit gate in the strong-field regime, illustrating QAT's ability to simultaneously provide both an intuitive, effective-Hamiltonian model and high accuracy.

Title: Quantum Averaging Theory for Multi-Timescale Driven Quantum Systems
Authors: Kristian D. Barajas, Wesley C. Campbell
Abstract: We present a multi-timescale Quantum Averaging Theory (QAT), a generalized unitarity-preserving analytic framework for modeling periodically and almost-periodically driven quantum systems across multiple timescales. By integrating the Magnus expansion with the method of averaging on multiple scales, QAT captures the effects of both far-detuned and near-resonant interactions on system dynamics. The framework yields an effective Hamiltonian description while retaining fast oscillatory effects within a separate dynamical phase operator, ensuring accuracy across a wide range of driving regimes. We demonstrate the rapid convergence of QAT results toward exact numerical solutions in both detuning regimes for touchstone problems in quantum information science.

Title: Singular Value Decomposition and Its Blind Spot for Quantum Chaos in Non-Hermitian Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev Models
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Kyoung-Bum Huh, Hyun-Sik Jeong, Xuhao Jiang, Keun-Young Kim, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: The study of chaos and complexity in non-Hermitian quantum systems poses significant challenges due to the emergence of complex eigenvalues in their spectra. Recently, the singular value decomposition (SVD) method was proposed to address these challenges. In this work, we identify two critical shortcomings of the SVD approach when analyzing Krylov complexity and spectral statistics in non-Hermitian settings. First, we show that SVD fails to reproduce conventional eigenvalue statistics in the Hermitian limit for systems with non-positive definite spectra, as exemplified by a variant of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. Second, and more fundamentally, Krylov complexity and spectral statistics derived via SVD cannot distinguish chaotic from integrable non-Hermitian dynamics, leading to results that conflict with complex spacing ratio analysis. Our findings reveal that SVD is inadequate for probing quantum chaos in non-Hermitian systems, and we advocate employing more robust methods, such as the bi-Lanczos algorithm, for future research in this direction.

Title: Harnessing natural and mechanical airflows for surface-based atmospheric pollutant removal
Authors: Samuel D. Tomlinson, Aliki M. Tsopelakou, Tzia M. Onn, Steven R. H. Barrett, Adam M. Boies, Shaun D. Fitzgerald
Abstract: Removal strategies for atmospheric pollutants are increasingly being considered to mitigate global warming and improve public health. However, surface-based removal techniques, such as sorption, catalysis and filtration, are often limited by pollutant transport and removal rate constraints. We evaluate the atmospheric pollutant transport to surfaces and assess the potential of surface-based removal technologies for applications in airflow through cities, HVAC systems and over vehicles. If these removal technologies are applied to their surfaces, cities, solar farms, HVAC systems and filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal rates that exceed 1 GtCO$_2$e annually (20-year GWP). Cities have the highest atmospheric pollutant removal potential, with estimates averaging 30 GtCO$_2$, 0.06 GtCH$_4$, 0.0001 GtPM$_{2.5}$, 0.007 GtNO$_\text{x}$ annually. HVAC filters can achieve atmospheric pollutant removal costs as low as \$300 per tCO$_2$e removed when sorption or catalyst technologies are incorporated into their fibre sheets, outperforming the \$2000 per tCO$_2$e removal cost when these technologies are applied to city surfaces. This estimate is based on the literature values for these technologies' costs per square meter. However, our calculations indicate that optimising catalyst properties and surface coverage could lower the cost estimates to below \$100 per tCO$_2$e across these applications. These findings demonstrate that integrating surface-based pollutant removal technologies into infrastructure may offer a scalable pathway to advance climate and health objectives.

Title: Interacting Twisted Bilayer Graphene with Systematic Modeling of Structural Relaxation
Authors: Tianyu Kong, Alexander B. Watson, Mitchell Luskin, Kevin D. Stubbs
Abstract: Twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) has drawn significant interest due to recent experiments which show that TBG can exhibit strongly correlated behavior such as the superconducting and correlated insulator phases. Much of the theoretical work on TBG has been based on analysis of the Bistritzer-MacDonald model which includes a phenomenological parameter to account for lattice relaxation. In this work, we use a newly developed continuum model which systematically accounts for the effects of structural relaxation. In particular, we model structural relaxation by coupling linear elasticity to a stacking energy that penalizes disregistry. We compare the impact of the two relaxation models on the corresponding many-body model by defining an interacting model projected to the flat bands. We perform tests at charge neutrality at both the Hartree-Fock and Coupled Cluster Singles and Doubles (CCSD) level of theory and find the systematic relaxation model gives quantitative differences from the simplified relaxation model.

Title: SA-GAT-SR: Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks with Symbolic Regression for high-fidelity material property prediction
Authors: Junchi Liu, Ying Tang, Sergei Tretiak, Wenhui Duan, Liujiang Zhou
Abstract: Recent advances in machine learning have demonstrated an enormous utility of deep learning approaches, particularly Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for materials science. These methods have emerged as powerful tools for high-throughput prediction of material properties, offering a compelling enhancement and alternative to traditional first-principles calculations. While the community has predominantly focused on developing increasingly complex and universal models to enhance predictive accuracy, such approaches often lack physical interpretability and insights into materials behavior. Here, we introduce a novel computational paradigm, Self-Adaptable Graph Attention Networks integrated with Symbolic Regression (SA-GAT-SR), that synergistically combines the predictive capability of GNNs with the interpretative power of symbolic regression. Our framework employs a self-adaptable encoding algorithm that automatically identifies and adjust attention weights so as to screen critical features from an expansive 180-dimensional feature space while maintaining O(n) computational scaling. The integrated SR module subsequently distills these features into compact analytical expressions that explicitly reveal quantum-mechanically meaningful relationships, achieving 23 times acceleration compared to conventional SR implementations that heavily rely on first principle calculations-derived features as input. This work suggests a new framework in computational materials science, bridging the gap between predictive accuracy and physical interpretability, offering valuable physical insights into material behavior.

Title: Optimal statistical ensembles for quantum thermal state preparation within the quantum singular value transformation framework
Authors: Yasushi Yoneta
Abstract: Preparing thermal equilibrium states is an essential task for finite-temperature quantum simulations. In statistical mechanics, microstates in thermal equilibrium can be obtained from statistical ensembles. To date, numerous ensembles have been devised, ranging from Gibbs ensembles such as the canonical and microcanonical ensembles to a variety of generalized ensembles. Since these ensembles yield equivalent thermodynamic predictions, one can freely choose an ensemble for computational convenience. In this paper, we exploit this flexibility to develop an efficient quantum algorithm for preparing thermal equilibrium states. We first present a quantum algorithm for implementing generalized ensembles within the framework of quantum singular value transformation. We then perform a detailed analysis of the computational cost and elucidate its dependence on the choice of the ensemble. Our analysis shows that employing an appropriate ensemble can significantly mitigate ensemble-dependent overhead and yield improved scaling of the computational cost with system size compared to existing methods based on the canonical ensemble. We also numerically demonstrate that our approach achieves a significant reduction in the computational cost even for small finite-size systems. Our algorithm applies to arbitrary thermodynamic systems at any temperature and is thus expected to offer a practical and versatile method for computing finite-temperature properties of quantum many-body systems. These results highlight the potential of ensemble design as a powerful tool for enhancing the efficiency of a broad class of quantum algorithms.

Title: Flat band mediated photon-photon interactions in 2D waveguide QED networks
Authors: Matija Tečer, Giuseppe Calajó, Marco Di Liberto
Abstract: We investigate a Lieb lattice of quantum emitters coupled to a two-dimensional waveguide network and demonstrate that this system supports an energetically isolated flat band, enabling localization despite the presence of long-range photon-mediated couplings. We then explore the two-excitation dynamics in both the softcore and hardcore interaction regimes, which arise from the nonlinearity of the emitters. In the softcore regime, we observe interaction-induced photon transport within the flat band, mediated by the formation of bound photon pairs. In the hardcore regime, corresponding to the two-level atom limit, we instead find the emergence of metastable exciton-like dressed states involving both flat and dispersive bands. Our findings highlight how the interplay between the collective behavior of emitters and effective photon-photon interactions can provide a platform for studying highly correlated photonic states in flat-band systems.

Title: Plasmonic Nanoparticle-in-nanoslit Antenna as Independently Tunable Dual-Resonant Systems for Efficient Frequency Upconversion
Authors: Huatian Hu, Zhiwei Hu, Christophe Galland, Wen Chen
Abstract: Dual-band plasmonic nanoantennas, exhibiting two widely separated user-defined resonances, are fundamental building blocks for the investigation and optimization of plasmon-enhanced optical phenomena, including photoluminescence, Raman scattering, and various nonlinear effects such as harmonic generation or sum-frequency generation, parametric down-conversion, etc. The nanoparticle-on-slit (NPoS) or nanoparticle-in-groove (NPiG) is a recently proposed dual-band antenna with independently tunable resonances at mid-infrared and visible wavelengths. It was used to enhance the corresponding sum- and difference-frequency generation processes from optimally located molecules by an estimated $10^{13}$-fold. However, the theoretical understanding of such structures and their eigenmodes remains poor, hindering further optimization and limiting broader applications. Here, we explore a diverse range of nanocavity-like quasi-normal modes (QNMs) supported by NPoS structures, examining the contributions of both their near-field (i.e., giant photonic density of states) and far-field (i.e., spatial radiation patterns) characteristics to frequency upconversion. We identify methods for independently tuning the visible and mid-infrared resonances while conserving a good mode overlap in the near field, which is essential for efficient nonlinear processes. Moreover, through mode analysis, we unveil an experimentally unexplored fundamental resonance with greater field enhancement and much-improved mode overlap with the mid-infrared field, which could, in principle, further boost the mid-infrared upconversion efficiency by 5-fold compared to existing results. This work helps to rationalize and optimize the enhancement of nonlinear effects across a wide spectral range using a flexible and experimentally attractive nanoplasmonic platform.
