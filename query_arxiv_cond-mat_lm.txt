Title: DenseGNN: universal and scalable deeper graph neural networks for high-performance property prediction in crystals and molecules
Authors: Hongwei Du, Jiamin Wang, Jian Hui, Lanting Zhang, Hong Wang
Abstract: Generative models generate vast numbers of hypothetical materials, necessitating fast, accurate models for property prediction. Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) excel in this domain but face challenges like high training costs, domain adaptation issues, and over-smoothing. We introduce DenseGNN, which employs Dense Connectivity Network (DCN), Hierarchical Node-Edge-Graph Residual Networks (HRN), and Local Structure Order Parameters Embedding (LOPE) to address these challenges. DenseGNN achieves state-of-the-art performance on datasets such as JARVIS-DFT, Materials Project, and QM9, improving the performance of models like GIN, Schnet, and Hamnet on materials datasets. By optimizing atomic embeddings and reducing computational costs, DenseGNN enables deeper architectures and surpasses other GNNs in crystal structure distinction, approaching X-ray diffraction method accuracy. This advances materials discovery and design.

Title: Soft symmetries of topological orders
Authors: Ryohei Kobayashi, Maissam Barkeshli
Abstract: (2+1)D topological orders possess emergent symmetries given by a group $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$, which consists of the braided tensor autoequivalences of the modular tensor category $\mathcal{C}$ that describes the anyons. In this paper we discuss cases where $\text{Aut}(\mathcal{C})$ has elements that neither permute anyons nor are associated to any symmetry fractionalization but are still non-trivial, which we refer to as soft symmetries. We point out that one can construct topological defects corresponding to such exotic symmetry actions by decorating with a certain class of gauged SPT states that cannot be distinguished by their torus partition function. This gives a physical interpretation to work by Davydov on soft braided tensor autoequivalences. This has a number of important implications for the classification of gapped boundaries, non-invertible spontaneous symmetry breaking, and the general classification of symmetry-enriched topological phases of matter. We also demonstrate analogous phenomena in higher dimensions, such as (3+1)D gauge theory with gauge group given by the quaternion group $Q_8$.

Title: Sub-micron Circuit Fabrication on Diamond Anvils for Mesoscopic High-Pressure Experiments
Authors: Z. R. Rehfuss, K. Zheng, S. L. Gould, K. W. Murch, S. Ran
Abstract: We present a novel fabrication procedure to produce high-quality lift-off structures on diamond anvils extending from the culet down to the slanted facets. Feature sizes down to 500 nm are achieved through the use of a bi-layer resist stack and electron beam lithography. Device structures with strong adhesion to the diamond surface and high abrasion resistance are realized by optimizing the surface treatment. To benchmark our process, we fabricate a multi-lead tungsten circuit to measure changes of the superconducting transition temperature of zirconium across the structural phase transition at $\sim$30 GPa; showing a 4-fold jump of the critical temperature. Our process is easily reproducible in most traditional academic and industrial cleanroom facilities. This work paves the way for complex and high-precision fabrication and measurements inside diamond anvil cells and on other faceted crystalline samples.

Title: Probing Stress and Magnetism at High Pressures with Two-Dimensional Quantum Sensors
Authors: Guanghui He, Ruotian Gong, Zhipan Wang, Zhongyuan Liu, Jeonghoon Hong, Tongxie Zhang, Ariana L. Riofrio, Zachary Rehfuss, Mingfeng Chen, Changyu Yao, Thomas Poirier, Bingtian Ye, Xi Wang, Sheng Ran, James H. Edgar, Shixiong Zhang, Norman Y. Yao, Chong Zu
Abstract: Pressure serves as a fundamental tuning parameter capable of drastically modifying all properties of matter. The advent of diamond anvil cells (DACs) has enabled a compact and tabletop platform for generating extreme pressure conditions in laboratory settings. However, the limited spatial dimensions and ultrahigh pressures within these environments present significant challenges for conventional spectroscopy techniques. In this work, we integrate optical spin defects within a thin layer of two-dimensional (2D) materials directly into the high-pressure chamber, enabling an in situ quantum sensing platform for mapping local stress and magnetic environments up to 4~GPa. Compared to nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers embedded in diamond anvils, our 2D sensors exhibit around three times stronger response to local stress and provide nanoscale proximity to the target sample in heterogeneous devices. We showcase the versatility of our approach by imaging both stress gradients within the high-pressure chamber and a pressure-driven magnetic phase transition in a room-temperature self-intercalated van der Waals ferromagnet, Cr$_{1+\delta}$Te$_2$. Our work demonstrates an integrated quantum sensing device for high-pressure experiments, offering potential applications in probing pressure-induced phenomena such as superconductivity, magnetism, and mechanical deformation.

Title: Field-Induced Ordered Phases in Anisotropic Spin-1/2 Kitaev Chains
Authors: Mandev Bhullar, Haoting Xu, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: Motivated by intense research on two-dimensional spin-1/2 Kitaev materials, Kitaev spin chains and ladders, though geometrically limited, have been studied for their numerical simplicity and insights into extended Kitaev models. The phase diagrams under the magnetic field were also explored for these quasi-one dimensional models. For an isotropic Kitaev chain, it was found that a magnetic field polarizes the ground state except along the symmetric field angle, where the chain is found to remain gapless up to a critical field strength where it enters an intriguing soliton phase before reaching the polarized state at higher field strengths. Here we study an anisotropic Kitaev chain under a magnetic field using the density matrix renormalization group technique, where the ground state has a macroscopic degeneracy with a finite gap in the absence of the magnetic field. When the field is mainly aligned parallel to the strong bond, four-site and large unit-cell ordered phases arise. In a certain angle of the field, another ordered phase characterized by a uniform chirality with six-site periodicity emerges. We employ a perturbation theory to understand such field-induced ordered phases. The effective model uncovers the presence of transverse Ising and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interactions between unit cells, as well as further-neighbor Ising interaction induced by the magnetic field, which collectively explain the mechanisms behind these ordered states. Open questions and challenges are also discussed.

Title: Dynamic scaling theory for a field quench near the Kasteleyn transition in spin ice
Authors: Sukla Pal, Stephen Powell
Abstract: We present a dynamic scaling theory to describe relaxation dynamics following a magnetic-field quench near an unconventional phase transition in the magnetic material spin ice. Starting from a microscopic model, we derive an effective description for the critical dynamics in terms of the seeding and growth of string excitations, and use this to find scaling forms in terms of time, reduced temperature and monopole fugacity. We confirm the predictions of scaling theory using Monte Carlo simulations, which also show good quantitative agreement with analytical expressions valid in the limit of low monopole density. As well as being relevant for experiments in the spin ice materials, our results open the way for the study of dynamic critical properties in a family of unconventional classical phase transitions.

Title: Characterization of Flux Trapping in and Fabrication of Large-Scale Superconductor Circuits Using AC-Biased Shift Registers With 108500 Josephson Junctions
Authors: Evan B. Golden (1), Neel A. Parmar (1), Vasili K. Semenov (2), Sergey K. Tolpygo (1) ((1) Lincoln Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Lexington, MA, USA, (2) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Stony Brook University, Stony Brook, NY, USA)
Abstract: A variety of superconductor integrated circuits comprising six ac-powered SFQ shift registers with a total of 27078 bits and 108500 Josephson junctions (JJs) per 5 mm x 5 mm chip have been designed, fabricated, and tested to characterize flux trapping, fabrication process yield, and parameter spread. The six 4513-bit registers in the circuits have a common single-phase ac clock and individual input/output drivers enabling their parallel testing. We have investigated flux trapping in the circuits with various geometry, size, and distance between moats in two active ground planes (GPs), and containing up to three additional 'dummy' GPs, using multiple cooldowns through the critical temperature with various cooling rates and residual magnetic fields up to ~1.2 $\mu$T. For the slit-type and square moats arrayed along the sides of the register cells, we have found a negligible effect of flux sequestered in the moats on the operating margins of the registers, and negligible probability of detrimental flux trapping outside of the moats. Circuits with 0.3-$\mu$m-wide slit moats occupying <2% of the circuit area were fully operational in 100% of cooldowns, supporting the viability of VLSI superconductor digital circuits. We have found a strong enhancement of flux trapping outside of the moats in circuits with closely spaced GPs and determined a critical distance, t$_c$=0.6 $\mu$m, between them. The presence of GPs spaced below t$_c$ rendered the circuits nonoperational in 100% of cooldowns. We have measured 30 chips with >3M JJs and determined individual cell margins in 138 registers to characterize the fabrication-related parameter spread and detect fabrication defects and flux-trapping events. By finding outlier cells in the statistical distribution of the individual cell margins, we detected about one defect per million JJs, in most cases causing magnetic flux trapping in the affected cell.

Title: Ab initio calculations of erbium crystal field splittings in oxide hosts
Authors: Yogendra Limbu, Yueguang Shi, Joseph Sink, Tharnier O. Puel, Durga Paudyal, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We present an effective ab initio method to calculate the crystal field coefficients of an erbium (Er3+) ion experiencing different local site symmetries in several wide-band-gap oxides, and then evaluate crystal field splittings of these Er3+ ions for their ground and excited states. The optical transitions between the ground state (Z) and excited state (Y) manifolds of the environmentally shielded 4f states of these Er3+ ions have wavelengths ~1.5 microns and thus have potential applications to quantum communications and quantum memories. These results are in excellent agreement with recent low-temperature measurements, provided the inadequate calculation of the 4f shell screening is adjusted by reducing the radial extent of the 4f wavefunctions by approximately a factor of 2.

Title: Ab initio calculations of erbium crystal field splittings in oxide hosts: role of the 4f radial wave function
Authors: Yogendra Limbu, Yueguang Shi, Joseph Sink, Tharnier O. Puel, Durga Paudyal, Michael E. Flatté
Abstract: We expand here our description of a newly developed simple and effective ab initio method of calculating crystal field coefficients (CFCs) of rare-earth atoms in insulating hosts, focusing on Er in wide band gap oxide hosts MgO, ZnO, TiO$_2$, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$, which exemplify different local site symmetries. These hybrid functional calculations, which incorporate a portion of exact exchange from Hartree-Fock theory, reproduce the experimentally identified insulating band gaps of these oxides. The negative values of cohesive and formation energies confirm the structural and chemical stability of these oxides, whereas the defect formation energies indicate that Er doped ZnO, CaWO$_4$, and PbWO$_4$ are easier to form compared to Er doped MgO and TiO$_2$. Er doped in these oxide hosts exhibits a spin magnetic moment of $\sim$ 3 $\mu_B$ confirming the $3+$ valence state. The CFCs of these hosted Er are determined from charge densities and potentials obtained from non-spin-polarized calculations, involving a 4\textit{f} core approximation. These CFCs are subsequently used to solve an effective Hamiltonian and generate the crystal field splitting of Er 4f. These calculated Er 4f energy levels are in good agreement with available experiments.

Title: The dipolar Aleppo lattice: Ground state ordering and ergodic dynamics in the absence of vertex frustration
Authors: Gopi Mahato, Davis Crater, Christian Hoyt, Duncan Miertschin andBalaram Regmi, Kevin Hofhuis, Scott Dhuey, Barat Achinuq, Francesco Caravelli, Alan Farhan
Abstract: We introduce the Aleppo spin ice geometry, another variation of decimated square ice patterns, which in contrast to similar systems previously studied, does not exhibit vertex frustration. Using synchrotron-based photoemission electron microscopy, we directly visualize low-energy states achieved after thermal annealing, in addition to temperature-dependent moment fluctuations. The results reveal the observation of ground state patterns and the absence of ergodicity-breaking dynamics. Our observations further confirm vertex frustration to be an important criterion for the emergence of ergodicity transitions.

Title: Space Charge Doping Induced Band Modulation in Mono- and Bi-layer Graphene: a nano-ARPES study
Authors: Imtiaz Noor Bhatti, J. Avila, Z. Chen, A. Baron, Y. Zhang, A. Shukla, P. Dudin
Abstract: Controlled modulation of electronic band structure in two-dimensional (2D) materials via doping is crucial for devices fabrication. For instance doped graphene has been envisaged for various applications like sensors, super-capacitors, transistors, p-n junctions, photo-detectors, etc. Many different techniques have been developed to achieve desired doping in 2D materials, like chemical doping, electrostatic doping, substrate doping, etc. Here, we have combined space charge doping with space and angle resolved photoemission (nano-ARPES), in order to directly observe the Fermi level modulation on micron-sized flakes of monolayer and bilayer graphene. The doping level can be tuned in a controlled manner, which allows us to directly observe the Fermi level tuning. In our experiment we successfully doped the graphene with p- and n-type carriers (holes/electrons) which are directly observed through band shift in ARPES measurements. The observed band shift is $\sim$250 meV for bilayer and $\sim$500 meV for monolayer graphene. The results from our experiment promote the space charge doping technique and nano-ARPES into other materials such as 2D semiconductors and superconductors, in order to directly observe the physical phenomena such as band gap transition and phase transition as function of carrier doping.

Title: Magnetic properties of Cr$_8$ and V$_8$ molecular rings from ab initio calculations
Authors: Elia Stocco, Maria Barbara Maccioni, Andrea Floris, Matteo Cococcioni
Abstract: Molecular nanomagnets are systems with a vast phenomenology and are very promising for a variety of technological applications, most notably spintronics and quantum information. Their low-energy spectrum and magnetic properties can be modeled using effective spin Hamiltonians, once the exchange coupling parameters between the localized magnetic moments are determined. In this work we employ density functional theory (DFT) to compute the exchange parameters between the atomic spins for two representative ring-shaped molecules containing eight transition-metal magnetic ions: Cr$_8$ and V$_8$. Considering a set of properly chosen spin configurations and mapping their DFT energies on the corresponding expressions from a Heisenberg Hamiltonian, we compute the exchange couplings between magnetic ions which are first, second and further neighbors on the rings. In spite of their chemical and structural similarities the two systems exhibit very different ground states: antiferromagnetic for Cr$_8$, ferromagnetic for V$_8$, which also features non-negligible couplings between second nearest neighbors. A rationalization of these results is proposed that is based on a multi-band Hubbard model with less-than-half filled shells on magnetic ions.

Title: Simulating Pattern Recognition Using Non-volatile Synapses: MRAM, Ferroelectrics and Magnetic Skyrmions
Authors: Luis Sosa, Minhyeok Wi, Miguel Barrera, Imran Nasrullah, Yingying Wu
Abstract: This project explores the use of non-volatile synapses in neuromorphic computing for pattern recognition tasks through a comprehensive simulation-based approach. The main approach is through spintronic synapses, which leverage the electron's spin properties to achieve efficient data processing and storage. This offers a promising alternative to traditional electronic synapses which require constant power recharge to prevent data leakage. The goal is to develop and simulate a neural network model that incorporates spintronic synapses, examining their potential to perform complex pattern recognition tasks such as image and sound classification. By building a simulation environment, we will replicate various models, including spin transfer torque based MRAM, voltage controlled magnetic anisotropy based MRAM, ferroelectric field effect transistors, and skyrmion based nanotrack for synaptic devices, to evaluate their performance and compare results across different non-volatile implementations. The findings will highlight the effectiveness of spintronic synapses in creating low-power, high-performance neuromorphic hardware, providing valuable insights into their application for future energy-efficient artificial intelligence systems.

Title: Analog of the Carnot engine for fluctuating diffusivity in living cells
Authors: Yuichi Itto
Abstract: Recently, a formal analogy between the fluctuating diffusivity and thermodynamics has been proposed based on phenomena of heterogeneous diffusion observed in living cells. This not only offers the analogs of the quantity of heat and work as well as the internal energy but also achieves that of the Clausius inequality for the entropy concerning diffusivity fluctuations. Here, a discussion is developed about constructing a heat-like engine in terms of the fluctuating diffusivity. The engine constitutes two kinds of processes with the average diffusivity or the average local temperature being kept fixed, along which the fluctuation distribution obeys an exponential law. The efficiency of the engine in a cycle, which quantifies how much the diffusivity change as the analog of work can be extracted, is found to formally coincide with that of Carnot's. During the cycle, the total change of the entropy is also shown to vanish.

Title: Critical-like phenomenon in scraping of jamming systems
Authors: Masaya Endo, Rei Kurita
Abstract: In jamming systems like colloids, emulsions, foams, and biological tissues, significant deformation is essential for processes such as material scraping or wound self-healing. To adequately spread a foam or cream over a surface, external force must be applied to artificially scrape it. The scraping of foam using a rigid plate has been observed to exhibit complex behavior distinct from that of simple liquids. In this study, we quantitatively analyzed the transition between partial and slender scraping regimes by examining changes in internal structure and partial spreading lengths. Our findings reveal that the sequential propagation of bubble rearrangement in the foam's internal structure leads to the partial scraping. Moreover, the scraping length in the partial scraping regime shows divergence near the transition point, characterized by a critical exponent of approximately 0.61. These results imply that foam scraping is governed by directional percolation theory, supported by the agreement between the experimentally observed critical exponent and theoretical predictions. This research significantly advances the understanding of macroscopic kinetics and rheological behavior in jamming systems, including foams, colloids, emulsions, and biological tissues.

Title: Probing growth precursor diffusion lengths by inter-surface diffusion
Authors: Stoffel D. Janssens, Francisco S. Forte Neto, David Vázquez-Cortés, Fernando P. Duda, Eliot Fried
Abstract: Understanding and optimizing thin-film synthesis requires measuring the diffusion length $d_\alpha$ of adsorbed growth precursors. Despite technological advances, in-situ measurements of $d_\alpha$ are often unachievable due to harsh deposition conditions, such as high temperatures or reactive environments. In this paper, we propose a fitting approach to determine $d_\alpha$ from experimental data by leveraging inter-surface diffusion between a substrate and a strip obtained by, for example, processing a film. The substrate serves as a source or sink of precursors, influencing the growth dynamics and shaping the profile of the strip. By fitting simulated profiles to given profiles, we demonstrate that $d_\alpha$ can be determined. To achieve this, we develop a theoretical growth model, a simulation strategy, and a fitting procedure. The growth model incorporates inter-surface diffusion, adsorption, and desorption of growth precursors, with growth being proportional to the concentration of adsorbed precursors. In our simulations, a chain of nodes represents a profile, and growth is captured by the displacement of those nodes, while keeping the node density approximately constant. For strips significantly wider than $d_\alpha$, a scaled precursor concentration and $d_\alpha$ are the fitting parameters that are determined by minimizing a suitably defined measure of the distance between simulated and given profiles. We evaluate the robustness of our procedure by analyzing the effect of profile resolution and noise on the fitted parameters. Our approach can offer valuable insights into thin-film growth processes, such as those occurring during plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition.

Title: Transitions from Composite Fermi Liquid to Moore-Read States in Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Jiong-Hao Wang, Yong Xu
Abstract: Weyl semimetals represent a significant class of topological gapless materials in three dimensions and have been shown to exhibit three-dimensional quantum Hall effect. However, existing research mainly focuses on scenarios without interactions. Recent studies suggest that the fractional quantum Hall effect can arise in a Weyl semimetal with a one-third filled Landau level under a magnetic field. However, it remains unclear whether more exotic states, such as composite Fermi liquid and MooreRead states, can appear at half filling. Here we surprisingly find the existence of composite Fermi liquid, Moore-Read states and charge density waves in the same Weyl-orbit-based Landau level of a Weyl semimetal and their transitions induced by varying the distance between Weyl points. We attribute these transitions to a significant change in the single-particle wave functions of the Landau level as the distance between Weyl points is varied. Finally, we demonstrate that a transition from composite Fermi liquid to Moore-Read states can be induced by tuning the direction of a magnetic field, a process that is more experimentally accessible.

Title: Quantum simulations of defects near the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$
Authors: Vijaya Begum-Hudde, Yi-Ting Lee, Barbara A. Jones, André Schleife
Abstract: Defects in materials are ubiquitous and one of their adverse effects in $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$ is the initiation of corrosion. While this process starts near the surface, the defects involved and their electronic structure need to be elucidated with high accuracy. Since point defects are confined to a small spatial region, defect embedding theory allows the definition of an active space, comprising of the defect electronic states, that is coupled to the environment of the host material. The active space Hamiltonian is of small rank, enabling access to its electronic properties using a high-level or even exact quantum theory. In this paper we use these techniques and first-principles simulations to compute the structural and electronic properties of near-surface vacancies for the (0001) surface of $\alpha$-Al$_2$O$_3$, and investigate the influence of defects and hydration on the initiation and propagation of corrosion. We report the defect electronic structure for strongly localized ground and excited states of the surface O vacancy and compare results obtained using full configuration interaction and a variational quantum eigensolver on a quantum computer. Error mitigation techniques are explored and shown to reduce the error due to the hardware noise to the point where the quantum result agrees with the exact solution within chemical accuracy.

Title: On the addition of micron-size intruders in a shear-thickening suspension of nanoparticles
Authors: Alice Pelosse, Heinrich M. Jaeger
Abstract: This study investigates the rheological behavior of shear-thickening suspensions made of different types of nanoparticles upon the addition of large intruders referred to as granules. The size ratio ranges from 20 to 120. We examine the effects of granule size, volume fraction, and surface properties on shear-thickening characteristics. Starting with a fumed silica suspension exhibiting discontinuous shear thickening (DST) without granules, the addition of granules at different volume fractions, shifts the onset of thickening to lower shear rates. Concomitantly, the strength of the thickening, quantified by the thickening index, decreases, transitioning from DST to continuous shear thickening (CST). Comparison with suspensions of nanosilica spheres reveals a similar trend, suggesting generality across different systems. However, these results contrast with cornstarch-based suspensions, where granule addition enhances thickening. This difference is attributed to the large size ratio studied here: When the granules are much larger than the particles in the interstitial suspension, the granules introduce a spread in the local shear rate and disrupt the particles' ability to form an extended fabric of force chains. The findings highlight the critical role of particle size ratio in determining the rheology of complex suspensions, paving the way for tailoring material properties in industrial and scientific applications.

Title: Orbital fluctuations and spin-orbital-lattice coupling in Bi2Fe4O9
Authors: Aditya Prasad Roy, M. K. Chattopadhyay, Ranjan Mittal, Srungarpu N. Achary, Avesh K. Tyagi, Manh Duc Le, Dipanshu Bansal
Abstract: Magnetic frustrations and degeneracies profoundly affect ground-state magnetic properties emerging from competing exchange interactions. Controlling such frustrations using orbital and phonon engineering via the Kugel-Khomskii-type (KK-type) interactions has recently enabled the orbital enhancement of magnetoelectric (ME) coupling. Using combined spectroscopic techniques and first-principle simulations, here we demonstrate that the magnetically frustrated Cairo lattice, Bi2Fe4O9, exhibits a strong KK-type interaction resulting in a coupled spin-orbital phase below 1.8 times the Neel temperature (TN = 245 K). We observe an order of magnitude change in phonon linewidths that is not explainable considering spin-phonon coupling channels alone. Instead, the observed change is reminiscent of orbitally active materials, which we explicitly confirm by measuring the T-dependence of low-energy orbital excitations. We further find that Bi2Fe4O9 harbors an unstable polar mode, driving the lattice to a symmetry-lowered ferroelectric (FE) phase below TN, in line with the previously reported hysteresis in polarization. Nonetheless, the FE phase leads to extremely small calculated superlattice Bragg peak intensities that are yet to be experimentally confirmed. Moreover, thermal conductivity measurements do not show any measurable effect of KK-type interactions on thermal transport across TN. But, we observe a repeatable anomaly near 57 K appearing only in the heating cycle, which co-occurs with the 400 meV broad continuum observed in Raman measurements. The observed KK-type interaction in Bi2Fe4O9 provides an opportunity for orbital enhancement of ME coupling by phonon control of superexchange interactions.

Title: Zero Field Antiferromagnetically Coupled Skyrmions and their Field-Driven Uncoupling in Composite Chiral Multilayers
Authors: May Inn Sim, Dickson Thian, Ramu Maddu, Xiaoye Chen, Hang Khume Tan, Chao Li, Pin Ho, Anjan Soumyanarayanan
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic (AF) skyrmions are topological spin structures with fully compensated, net-zero magnetization. Compared to their ferromagnetic (FM) skyrmion counterparts, their reduced stray field and enhanced electrical response can enable linear, high-throughput current-driven motion. However, their bubble-like character in conventional bilayer AFs limits their stability to fluctuations, leading to deformation and annihilation. Here we present the engineering of a composite AF chiral multilayer, wherein the interplay of AF and FM interlayer couplings generates compensated skyrmions with compact structures. High-resolution magnetic imaging and micromagnetic simulations show that the internal exchange field stabilizes AF skyrmions at zero external field with characteristics comparable to FM counterparts at 100 mT. Quantitative analyses establish their decoupling above the exchange field, yielding independent, spatially segregated textures in constituent chiral layers. This work provides a foundation to develop AF spin-textures with enhanced immunity, compatible with efficient readout and manipulation, with relevance to unconventional computing.

Title: Metallisation of the Mott Insulator Ca$_{2}$RuO$_{4}$ using Electric Double-Layer Gating
Authors: Tatsuhiro Sakami, Hiroki Ogura, Akihiro Ino, Takumi Ouchi, Tsutomu Nojima, Fumihiko Nakamura
Abstract: To verify whether the Mott insulator Ca2RuO4 can be switched by applying electric-field alone, regardless of current flow, we employ metallisation using electric double-layer gating (EDLG). The resistance change due to EDLG occurs only when positive gate-voltage above +3 V is applied. The amplitude of the reduction, reaching ~97% of the initial value, is difficult to interpret as surface metallisation and is likely related to structural change in bulk.

Title: Theory of Tunneling between Two-Dimensional Electron Layers Driven by Spin Pumping: Adiabatic Regime and Beyond
Authors: Modi Ke, Mahmoud M. Asmar, Wang-Kong Tse
Abstract: Tunneling spectroscopy between parallel two-dimensional (2D) electronic systems provides a powerful method to probe the underlying electronic properties by measuring tunneling conductance. In this work, we present a theoretical framework for spin transport in 2D-to-2D tunneling systems, driven by spin pumping. This theory applies to a vertical heterostructure where two layers of metallic 2D electron systems are separated by an insulating barrier, with one layer exchange-coupled to a magnetic layer driven at resonance. Utilizing a non-perturbative Floquet-Keldysh formalism, we derive general expressions for the tunneling spin and charge currents across a broad range of driving frequencies, extending beyond the traditional adiabatic pumping regime. At low frequencies, we obtain analytical results that recover the known behaviors in the adiabatic regime. However, at higher frequencies, our numerical findings reveal significant deviations in the dependence of spin and charge currents on both frequency and precession angle. This work offers fresh insights into the role of magnetization dynamics in tunneling transport, opening up new avenues for exploring non-adiabatic spin pumping phenomena.

Title: A Novel Approach to Real-Time Short-Term Traffic Prediction based on Distributed Fiber-Optic Sensing and Data Assimilation with a Stochastic Cell-Automata Model
Authors: Yoshiyuki Yajima, Hemant Prasad, Daisuke Ikefuji, Takemasa Suzuki, Shin Tominaga, Hitoshi Sakurai, Manabu Otani
Abstract: This paper demonstrates real-time short-term traffic flow prediction through distributed fiber-optic sensing (DFOS) and data assimilation with a stochastic cell-automata-based traffic model. Traffic congestion on expressways is a severe issue. To alleviate its negative impacts, it is necessary to optimize traffic flow prior to becoming serious congestion. For this purpose, real-time short-term traffic flow prediction is promising. However, conventional traffic monitoring apparatus used in prediction methods faces a technical issue due to the sparsity in traffic flow data. To overcome the issue for realizing real-time traffic prediction, this paper employs DFOS, which enables to obtain spatially continuous and real-time traffic flow data along the road without dead zones. Using mean velocities derived from DFOS data as a feature extraction, this paper proposes a real-time data assimilation method for the short-term prediction. As the theoretical model, the stochastic Nishinari-Fukui-Schadschneider model is adopted. Future traffic flow is simulated with the optimal values of model parameters estimated from observed mean velocities and the initial condition estimated as the latest microscopic traffic state. This concept is validated using two congestion scenarios obtained in Japanese expressways. The results show that the mean absolute error of the predicted mean velocities is 10-15 km/h in the prediction horizon of 30 minutes. Furthermore, the prediction error in congestion length and travel time decreases by 40-84% depending on congestion scenarios when compared with conventional methods with traffic counters. This paper concludes that real-time data assimilation using DFOS enables an accurate short-term traffic prediction.

Title: Anisotropic magnetism and spin fluctuations in the triangular-lattice spin-liquid candidate NaYbSe$_2$: a single-crystal $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se NMR study
Authors: S. Luther, K. M. Ranjith, Th. Doert, J. Wosnitza, H. Kühne, M. Baenitz
Abstract: The ytterbium-based delafossite NaYbSe$_2$ is discussed as a prototype for a spin-orbit entangled, effective spin-1/2 triangular spin lattice with emerging antiferromagnetic correlations and a quantum-spin-liquid (QSL) ground state. We report on a comprehensive study of the static and dynamic anisotropic magnetism in single-crystalline samples of NaYbSe$_2$, using NMR spectroscopy as a local-probe technique. We performed $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se NMR measurements in magnetic fields up to 16 T, applied along the in-plane and out-of-plane crystallographic directions and at temperatures from 300 down to 0.3 K. We could determine the anisotropic hyperfine contributions from the angular dependence of the $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se NMR spectra. In the paramagnetic regime, we probed the temperature dependence of the $^{23}$Na and $^{77}$Se spectral shift and the hyperfine coupling constants for fields applied along the principal crystal axes. The spin-lattice relaxation-rate data indicate critical spin fluctuations and the absence of long-range magnetic order at low magnetic fields and temperatures down to 0.3 K, evidenced by a monotonic increase of $1/T_1$ and associated spectral broadening. This is a clear proof of the evolution of a critical QSL ground state with residual fluctuations down to lowest temperatures. At elevated fields, we observe the emergence of long-range order, as the temperature-dependent $1/T_1$ rate passes through a pronounced maximum at $T_N$ at given field, followed by a decrease at lower temperatures. Further, we find an inhomogeneous broadening of the $^{23}$Na spectra below $T_N$, probing the histogram of the local-field distribution in the presence of the field-induced order.

Title: Magnetic imaging under high pressure with a spin-based quantum sensor integrated in a van der Waals heterostructure
Authors: Z. Mu, J. Fraunié, A. Durand, S. Clément, A. Finco, J. Rouquette, A. Hadj-Azzem, N. Rougemaille, J. Coraux, J. Li, T. Poirier, J. H. Edgar, I. C. Gerber, X. Marie, B. Gil, G. Cassabois, C. Robert, V. Jacques
Abstract: Pressure is a powerful thermodynamic parameter for tuning the magnetic properties of van der Waals magnets owing to their weak interlayer bonding. However, local magnetometry measurements under high pressure still remain elusive for this important class of emerging materials. Here we introduce a method enabling in situ magnetic imaging of van der Waals magnets under high pressure with sub-micron spatial resolution. Our approach relies on a quantum sensing platform based on boron-vacancy (V$_\text{B}^-$) centers in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN), which can be placed in atomic contact of any type of two-dimensional (2D) material within a van der Waals heterostructure. We first show that the V$_\text{B}^-$ center can be used as a magnetic field sensor up to pressures of a few GPa, a pressure range for which the properties of a wide variety of van der Waals magnets are efficiently altered. We then use V$_\text{B}^-$ centers in a thin hBN layer to perform magnetic imaging of a van der Waals magnet under pressure. As a proof of concept, we study the pressure-dependent magnetization in micrometer-sized flakes of $1T$-CrTe$_2$, whose evolution is explained by a shift of the Curie temperature. Besides providing a new path for studying pressure-induced phase transitions in van der Waals magnets, this work also opens up interesting perspectives for exploring the physics of 2D superconductors under pressure via local measurements of the Meissner effect.

Title: Terahertz-driven ultrafast dynamics of rare-earth nickelates by controlling only the charge degree of freedom
Authors: Gulloo Lal Prajapati, Sergey Kovalev, Igor Ilyakov, Atiqa Arshad, Gaurav Dubey, Ketan S. Navale, Dhanvir Singh Rana, Jan-Christoph Deinert
Abstract: An important strategy for understanding the microscopic physics of strongly correlated systems and enhancing their technological potential is to selectively drive the fundamental degrees of freedom out of equilibrium. Intense terahertz (THz) pulses with photon energies of a few meV, can not only serve this purpose but also unravel their electronic and quantum nature. Here, we present THz-driven ultrafast dynamics of rare-earth nickelates $\text{RNiO}_{\text{3}}$, $\text{R}$ = rare-earth atom) - a prototype system to study the Mott insulator-metal transition (IMT). The THz drive of its Mott insulating state induces instantaneous IMT via quantum tunneling of valence electrons across the bandgap while the THz drive of its correlated metallic state leads to overall heating of the conduction electrons. The subsequent relaxations of excited electrons in these two states occur via a two-step process (electron-phonon thermalization and recovery of the charge-ordered insulating state) and a one-step process (electron-phonon scattering), respectively. The relaxation dynamics of the electrons and the absence of acoustic phonon modes, in particular, suggest that the THz photons drive only the charge degree of freedom. The purely electronic, ultrafast and local nature of the THz-induced IMT offers its applications in opto-electronics with enhanced performance and minimal device size and heat dissipation.

Title: An Algebraic Proof of Thermal Wick's Theorem
Authors: Ruofan Chen
Abstract: Every many-body state can be constructed from the vacuum state by iteratively applying the creation operators, therefore the thermal expectation can be transformed into a sum of vacuum expectation where the vacuum Wick's theorem holds. Based on this observation this article gives an algebraic proof of thermal Wick's theorem.

Title: Extreme-temperature single-particle heat engine
Authors: Molly Message, Federico Cerisola, Jonathan D. Pritchett, Katie O'Flynn, Yugang Ren, Muddassar Rashid, Janet Anders, James Millen
Abstract: Carnot famously showed that engine operation is chiefly characterised by the magnitude of the temperature ratio $T_\mathrm{h}/T_\mathrm{c}$ between its hot and cold reservoirs. While temperature ratios ranging between $1.3-2.8$ and $2-10$ are common in macroscopic commercial engines and engines operating in the microscopic regime, respectively, the quest is to test thermodynamics at its extremes. Here we present the hottest engine on earth, with temperature ratios as high as $110$. We achieve this by realising an underdamped single-particle engine using a charged microparticle that is electrically levitated under vacuum conditions. Noisy electric fields are used to synthesise reservoir temperatures in excess of $10^7$ K. As a result, giant fluctuations show up in all thermodynamic quantities of the engine, such as heat exchange and efficiency. Moreover, we find that the particle experiences an effective position dependent temperature, which gives rise to dynamics that drastically deviates from that of standard Brownian motion. We develop a theoretical model accounting for the effects of this multiplicative noise and find excellent agreement with the measured dynamics. The high level of control over the presented experimental platform opens the door to emulate the stochastic dynamics of cellular and biological processes, and provides thermodynamic insight required for the development of nanotechnologies.

Title: The signature of topology in polar and chiral non-magnetic crystal classes
Authors: Giancarlo Soavi, Jan Wilhelm
Abstract: Topology is fundamental to condensed matter physics, underlying phenomena such as the quantum Hall effect in its various forms, protected surface states and spin-valley locking. Central to this is the Berry curvature, a measure of the geometric properties of Bloch wavefunctions in crystals. Despite its established connections to space inversion and time-reversal symmetries, a comprehensive framework linking the Berry curvature to other crystal symmetries is still missing. Here, we present a theoretical model for the Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature in the proximity of optical resonances for all non-magnetic crystal classes. The Jacobian matrix of the Berry curvature is readily derived from the second-order nonlinear optical susceptibilities of the time-invariant point groups. We show that the diagonal elements of the Jacobian matrix, which define the divergence of the Berry curvature, are non-zero only for the chiral crystal classes, pointing towards a topological origin of circular dichroism. In polar crystals, we uniquely find a non-zero curl of the Berry curvature, suggesting a topological origin of spontaneous polarization via the Maxwell-Berry equations. Our findings thus open new perspectives for the topological interpretation of textbook phenomena at the heart of condensed matter physics.

Title: Confinement and Activity-Driven Dynamics of Semiflexible Polymers in Motility Assays
Authors: Sandip Roy, Anil Kumar Dasanna
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of semiflexible polymers in a motility assay, where motor proteins (MPs) stochastically bind, unbind, and walk along the polymer, under the influence of harmonic confinement. Using Langevin dynamics simulations, we explore the interplay between the polymer's rigidity, activity in the form of attachment/detachment of MPs and subsequent movement of attached MPs, and trap strength, revealing a two-state transition from a trapped to a free polymer, with an intermediate coexistence region. Rigidity significantly impacts the trapping behaviour, with flexible polymers remaining trapped at the higher activity. Attachment/detachment of MPs can also induce a change in the effective rigidity of the polymer and, therefore, influence confinement by the this http URL polymer undergoes spiral and open-chain conformations, with the turning number serving as a key order parameter to quantify spiral formation. We show that confinement stabilizes spiral structures and suppresses open-chain motion, especially at higher activity. The centre of mass (COM) dynamics are analyzed through the mean square displacement (MSD), showing diffusive, ballistic, and diffusive regimes that depend on the trap strength and activity. Negative excess kurtosis indicates nonequilibrium behaviour, which saturates with increasing confinement, reflecting the dominance of the trap over the activity.

Title: Correlation time in extremal self-organized critical models
Authors: Rahul Chhimpa, Abha Singh, Avinash Chand Yadav
Abstract: We investigate correlation time numerically in extremal self-organized critical models, namely, the Bak-Sneppen evolution and the Robin Hood dynamics. The (fitness) correlation time is the duration required for the extinction or mutation of species over the entire spatial region in the critical state. We apply the methods of finite-size scaling and extreme value theory to understand the statistics of the correlation time. We find power-law system size scaling behaviors for the mean, the variance, the mode, and the peak probability of the correlation time. We obtain data collapse for the correlation time cumulative probability distribution, and the scaling function follows the generalized extreme value density close to the Gumbel function.

Title: Field-free perpendicular magnetization switching of low critical current density at room temperature in TaIrTe4/ferromagnet heterostructures
Authors: Lujun Wei, Pai Liu, Jincheng Peng, Yanghui Li, Lina Chen, Ping Liu, Feng Li, Wei Niu, Fei Huang, Jiaju Yang, Shuang Zhou, Yu Lu, Tianyu Liu, Jiarui Chen, Weihao Wang, Jian Zhang, Jun Du, Yong Pu
Abstract: Spin-orbit torque-induced perpendicular magnetization switching has attracted much attention due to the advantages of nonvolatility, high density, infinite read/write counts, and low power consumption in spintronic applications. To achieve field-free deterministic switching of perpendicular magnetization, additional magnetic field, magnetic layer assistance, or artificially designed structural symmetry breaking are usually required, which are not conducive to the high-density integration and application of low-power devices. However, 2D Weyl semimetals with low-symmetry structures have recently been found to generate z-spin-polarized currents, which may induce out-of-plane damping-like torques to their neighboring ferromagnetic layers, and realize deterministic perpendicular magnetization switching at zero magnetic field. In this Letter, we report that current-induced field-free magnetization switching at room temperature can be achieved in a perpendicularly magnetized TaIrTe4/Pt/Co/Pt device, and the critical switching current density can be lowered to be about 2.64*105 Acm-2. This study suggests that TaIrTe4 has great potential for the design of room-temperature efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Dichotomy of electron-phonon interactions in the delafossite PdCoO$_2$: From weak bulk to polaronic surface coupling
Authors: Gesa-R. Siemann, Philip A. E. Murgatroyd, Tommaso Antonelli, Edgar Abarca Morales, Seunghyun Khim, Helge Rosner, Matthew D. Watson, Andrew P. Mackenzie, Phil D. C. King
Abstract: The metallic delafossites host ultra-high mobility carriers in the bulk, while at their polar surfaces, intrinsic electronic reconstructions stabilise markedly distinct electronic phases, from charge-disproportionated insulators, to Rashba-split heavy-hole gases and ferromagnetic metals. The understanding of these phases has been strongly informed by surface spectroscopic measurements, but previous studies have been complicated by the presence of spatially varying terminations of the material surface. Here, we demonstrate the potential of microscopic-area angle-resolved photoemission to overcome these challenges. Our measurements of the model compound PdCoO$_2$ yield extremely high-quality spectra of the electronic structure, which allows us to place new experimental constraints on the weak electron-phonon coupling in the bulk of PdCoO$_2$, while revealing much stronger interactions at its surfaces. While the CoO$_2$-terminated surface exhibits a conventional weak-coupling behavior, our measurements reveal surprising spectroscopic signatures of polaron formation at the Pd-terminated surface, despite its pronounced metallicity. Together, our findings reveal how mode and symmetry-selective couplings can markedly tune the electron-phonon interactions in a single host material, here opening routes to stabilise surprisingly persistent polaronic quasiparticles.

Title: Transport in integrable and perturbed easy-axis Heisenberg chain: Thouless approach
Authors: J. Pawlowski, M. Mierzejewski, P. Prelovsek
Abstract: We study transport in the spin chains by employing the Thouless approach based on the level sensitivity to the boundary conditions, $R$. Although spin transport in the integrable easy-axis XXZ model is diffusive, corresponding $R$ is much closer to ballistic chains than to chaotic diffusive systems. In the case of the grand canonical ensemble this observation can be rigorously justified, while in the case of the canonical ensemble it can be demonstrated by numerical calculations. Integrability breaking perturbation (IBP) strongly reduces $R$ which reveals a pronounced minimum at the crossover from anomalous diffusive to normal dissipative transport. This minimum coincides with the onset of the universality of the random matrix theory. Results for various IBP suggest a discontinuous jump of the spin conductivity in the thermodynamic limit, and moreover that its value universally decreases when the strength of IBP decreases.

Title: Influence of the dividing surface notion on the formulation of Tolman's law
Authors: Martin Thomas Horsch
Abstract: The influence of the surface curvature on the surface tension of small droplets at equilibrium with a surrounding vapour, or small bubbles at equilibrium with a surrounding liquid, can be expanded as {\gamma}(R) = {\gamma}(planar) - .../R + O(1/R^2). According to Tolman's law, the first-order coefficient in this expansion is obtained from the planar limit of the Tolman length, i.e., the deviation between the equimolar radius and the Laplace radius. Here, Tolman's law is generalized such that it can be applied to any notion of the dividing surface, beside the Laplace radius, on the basis of a generalization of the Gibbs adsorption equation which consistently takes the size dependence of interfacial properties into account.

Title: Flux pinning in superconducting multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ nano-step junction
Authors: Minseong Kwon, Mingi Kim, Yoonji Gong, Heeyeon Lee, Young Duck Kim
Abstract: Superconductors exhibit dissipationless supercurrents even under finite bias and magnetic field conditions, provided these remain below the critical values. However, type-II superconductors in the flux flow regime display Ohmic dissipation arising from vortex dynamics under finite magnetic fields. The interplay between supercurrent and Ohmic dissipation in a type-II superconductor is dictated by vortex motion and the robustness of vortex pinning forces. In this study, we present an experimental investigation of the superconducting phase transitions and vortex dynamics in the atomically thin type-II superconductor 2H-NbSe$_2$. We fabricated a high-quality multilayer 2H-NbSe$_2$ with a step junction, demonstrating supercurrent in clean limit below a critical temperature of 6.6 K and a high residual resistance ratio of 17. The upper critical field was estimated to be 4.5 T and the Ginzburg-Landau coherence length 8.6 nm. Additionally, we observed phase transitions induced by vortex viscous dynamics in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ step junction. Analysis of the pinning force density using the Dew-Hughes model indicates that the pinning force in the 2H-NbSe$_2$ device can be attributed to step junction, related to the surface-$\Delta\kappa$ type of pinning centers. Our findings pave the way for engineering pinning forces by introducing artificial pinning centers through partial atomic thickness variation in layered 2D superconductors while minimizing unwanted quality degradation in the system.

Title: Patterns robust to Disorder in spatially-interacting Generalized Lotka-Volterra Ecosystems
Authors: Alessandro Salvatore, Fabián Aguirre-López, Ruben Zakine
Abstract: How do interactions between species influence their spatial distribution in an ecosystem? To answer this question, we introduce a spatially-extended ecosystem of Generalized Lotka-Volterra type, where species can diffuse and interactions are nonlocal. We compute the criterion for the loss of stability of the spatially homogeneous ecosystem, and we show that the stability of the uniform state crucially depends on the most abundant species, and on the interplay between space exploration during one species generation and the interaction range. Focusing on the spectrum of the interaction matrix weighted by the species abundances, we identify a Baik-Ben Arous-Péché transition that translates into a transition in the final patterns of the species repartition. Finally assuming that the disorder is small, we exhibit an explicit solution of the dynamical mean-field equation for the species density, obtained as the fixed point of a nonlocal Fisher-Kolmogorov-Petrovski-Piskounov equation. Our work paves the way of future combined approaches at the frontier of active matter and disordered systems, with the hope of better understanding complex ecosystems like bacterial communities.

Title: Concentration of Empirical First-Passage Times
Authors: Rick Bebon, Aljaz Godec
Abstract: First-passage properties are central to the kinetics of target-search processes. Theoretical approaches so far primarily focused on predicting first-passage statistics for a given process or model. In practice, however, one faces the reverse problem of inferring first-passage statistics from, typically sub-sampled, experimental or simulation data. Obtaining trustworthy estimates from under-sampled data and unknown underlying dynamics remains a daunting task, and the assessment of the uncertainty is imperative. In this chapter, we highlight recent progress in understanding and controlling finite-sample effects in empirical first-passage times of reversible Markov processes. Precisely, we present concentration inequalities bounding from above the deviations of the sample mean for any sample size from the true mean first-passage time and construct non-asymptotic confidence intervals. Moreover, we present two-sided bounds on the range of fluctuations, i.e, deviations of the expected maximum and minimum from the mean in any given sample, which control uncertainty even in situations where the mean is a priori not a sufficient statistic.

Title: Electroisomerization blinking of an azobenzene derivative molecule
Authors: Sylvie Godey (PCMP - IEMN, IEMN), Hugo Therssen (NCM - IEMN), David Guérin (NCM - IEMN, CMNF - IEMN), Thierry Melin (NCM - IEMN, IEMN), Stéphane Lenfant (IEMN, NCM - IEMN)
Abstract: We report here the reversibility and bistability of the switching behavior in an azobenzene derivative induced by the bias applied by a Scanning-Tunneling Microscopy (STM) tip, at low temperature and in ultra-high vacuum environment. This cis-to-trans and trans-to-cis switching were observed during STM imaging in either polarity at +2V or -2V, on a sub-second time scale. This results in a blinking effect visible on STM images, corresponding to the reversible switching of the azobenzene molecule under the applied STM bias through an electric field induced process.

Title: Gapless Symmetry-Protected Topological States in Measurement-Only Circuits
Authors: Xue-Jia Yu, Sheng Yang, Shuo Liu, Hai-Qing Lin, Shao-Kai Jian
Abstract: Measurement-only quantum circuits offer a versatile platform for realizing intriguing quantum phases of matter. However, gapless symmetry-protected topological (gSPT) states remain insufficiently explored in these settings. In this Letter, we generalize the notion of gSPT to the critical steady state by investigating measurement-only circuits. Using large-scale Clifford circuit simulations, we investigate the steady-state phase diagram across several families of measurement-only circuits that exhibit topological nontrivial edge states at criticality. In the Ising cluster circuits, we uncover a symmetry-enriched non-unitary critical point, termed symmetry-enriched percolation, characterized by both topologically nontrivial edge states and string operator. Additionally, we demonstrate the realization of a steady-state gSPT phase in a $\mathbb Z_4$ circuit model. This phase features topological edge modes and persists within steady-state critical phases under symmetry-preserving perturbations. Furthermore, we provide a unified theoretical framework by mapping the system to the Majorana loop model, offering deeper insights into the underlying mechanisms.

Title: Surface-dependent Majorana vortex phases in topological crystalline insulators
Authors: Xun-Jiang Luo, Xiao-Hong Pan, Yilin Shi, Fengcheng Wu
Abstract: The topological crystalline insulator SnTe exhibits two types of surface Dirac cones: one located at non-time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (001) and (110) surfaces, and the other at time-reversal-invariant momenta on the (111) surface. Motivated by the recent experimental evidence of Majorana vortex end modes (MVEMs) and their hybridization on the (001) surface [Nature 633, 71 (2024)], we present a comprehensive investigation of Majorana vortex phases in SnTe, including topological classification, surface-state Hamiltonians analysis, and lattice model calculations. By utilizing rotational and magnetic mirror symmetries, we present two equivalent methods to reveal the topology of Majorana phases on different surfaces. We find that the MVEMs on the (001) and (110) surfaces are protected by both magnetic group and rotational symmetries. In contrast, the MVEMs on the (111) surface are protected by magnetic group or particle-hole symmetry. Due to the different properties of Dirac fermions in the $\bar{\Gamma}$ and $\bar{M}$ valleys on the (111) surfaces, including Fermi velocities and energy levels, we find that abundant vortex phase transitions can occur for the [111]-direction vortex. As the chemical potential increases, the number of robust MVEMs can change from $0\rightarrow 1\rightarrow 2$. These vortex transitions are characterized by both $Z$ winding number and $Z_2$ pfaffian topological invariants.

Title: Slow convergence of spin-wave expansion and magnon dispersion in the 1/3 plateau of the triangular XXZ antiferromagnet
Authors: Achille Mauri, Frédéric Mila
Abstract: Motivated by recent experiments on the quantum magnet K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, we study theoretically the excitation spectrum of the nearest-neighbour triangular XXZ model in the limit of strong easy-axis anisotropy, within the up-up-down (1/3-plateau) phase. We make an expansion in $\alpha =J_{xy}/J_{zz}$ instead of $1/S$ and calculate the magnon dispersion for any value of the spin $S$ at second order in $\alpha$, with two important conclusions: (i) the 1/S expansion converges very slowly for S=1/2, making spin-wave theory quantitatively inaccurate up to very large orders; (ii) compared to the linear spin-wave predictions, our magnon dispersion presents a much better agreement with experimental results on K$_{2}$Co(SeO$_{3}$)$_{2}$, for which $\alpha \simeq 0.08$.

Title: Origin of ion bombardment induced Tb oxidation in Tb/Co multilayers
Authors: Daniel Kiphart, Michal Krupinski, Marzena Mitura-Nowak, Pawel Piotr Michalowski, Mateusz Kowacz, Marek Schmidt, Feliks Stobiecki, Gabriel David Chaves-O'Flynn, Piotr Kuswik
Abstract: Ion bombardment is currently an active area of research for patterning rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnetic thin films because the magnetic properties are extremely sensitive to changes in the constituent sublattices. It has previously been shown that ion bombardment can be used to deliberately reduce the contribution of the rare earth sublattice in rare earth/transition metal ferrimagnets by selective oxidation. However, the exact mechanism by which oxidation occurs remains an outstanding question. We show that the defects introduced by ion bombardment of Tb/Co multilayers using different ion species with projected range (i.e., 10 keV He + , 15 keV O + , and 30 keV Ga +) create easy diffusion paths for oxygen to penetrate the system. The choice of ion species and fluence enables the effective composition of the films to be tailored by reducing the amount of magnetically-active Tb.

Title: Grain boundaries amplify local chemical ordering in CrCoNi
Authors: Ian Geiger, Yuan Tian, Ying Han, Yutong Bi, Xiaoqing Pan, Penghui Cao, Timothy J. Rupert
Abstract: Local chemical ordering plays an important role in the behavior of complex concentrated alloys, yet its characterization remains challenging due to the nanoscale dimensions and scattered spatial distribution of the ordered domains. This study explores the potential of grain boundaries as microstructural anchor points that amplify chemical ordering and enable the formation of compositional nanopatterns in CrCoNi. Using hybrid Monte Carlo/molecular dynamics simulations, we reveal the development of distinct compositional waves with ordering vectors normal to grain boundaries, extending to lengths greater than 6 nm. These waves manifest as periodic enrichment and depletion patterns, with strong Ni depletion near the Ni-segregated grain boundary accompanied by Co and Cr enrichment. Analogous to surface-driven phase separation, the concentration waves emanating from the boundaries gradually attenuate as they propagate into the grain interior. This behavior highlights the interplay between boundary-dictated directional ordering and the isotropic, untemplated domain growth within the grain. This work advances our fundamental understanding of grain boundary-mediated ordering phenomena and offers a pathway for more precise experimental characterization of local chemical ordering in CCAs.

Title: Optical absorption and luminescence of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ from the Bethe Salpeter Equation
Authors: Claudio Garcia, Walter R. L. Lambrecht
Abstract: $\alpha$-Li$_x$V$_2$O$_5$ is obtained by intercalating Li between the layers of V$_2$O$_5$. The partial filling of the split-off conduction band by electron donation from Li leads to significant changes in optical properties. Here we study the electronic band structure of $\alpha$-LiV$_2$O$_5$ using quasiparticle self-consistent (QS) $GW$ calculations and the optical dielectric function by means of the Bethe Salpeter equation. We find a very strong optical absorption band related to transitions between the filled V-$d_{xy}$ like states to the empty ones with strong polarization along the $a$-direction. We relate this to recent experimental observations of cathodoluminescence (CL) in which a supression of the CL was observed upon addition of Li.

Title: Optimal Estimation of Temperature
Authors: Shaoyong Zhang, Zhaoyu Fei, Xiaoguang Wang
Abstract: Over the past century, the Boltzmann entropy has been widely accepted as the standard definition of entropy for an isolated system. However, it coexists with controversial alternatives, such as the Gibbs entropy. These definitions, including the Boltzmann entropy, exhibit certain inconsistencies, both mathematically and thermodynamically. To address this challenge, we introduce the estimation theory in statistical inference into the study of thermodynamics and statistical physics for finite-sized systems. By regarding the finite-sized system as a thermometer used to measure the temperature of the heat reservoir, we show that optimal estimation of temperature yields the corresponding entropy formula for an isolated system. In the single-sample case, optimal estimation of inverse temperature (or temperature) corresponds to the Boltzmann entropy (or Gibbs entropy). These different definitions of entropy, rather than being contradictory, apply to optimal estimation of different parameters. Furthermore, via the Laplace transform, we identify a complementarity between estimation of temperature and system's energy, a concept suggested by Niels Bohr. We also correct the energy-temperature uncertainty relation, as expressed by the Cramér-Rao bound, in the large-$N$ limit. In the multiple-sample case, we generalize the definitions of both Boltzmann entropy and Gibbs entropy to achieve optimal estimation of temperature, revealing the tight connection between statistical inference and Terrell Hill's nanothermodynamics.

Title: Kinetic theory of decentralized learning for smart active matter
Authors: Gerhard Jung, Misaki Ozawa, Eric Bertin
Abstract: Smart active matter describes agents which can process information according to their individual policy to solve predefined tasks. We introduce a theoretical framework to study a decentralized learning process in which agents can locally exchange their policy to optimize their reward and thus attain target macroscopic states. We use our formalism to derive explicit hydrodynamic equations for the policy dynamics. We apply the theory to two different microscopic models where policies correspond either to fixed parameters similar to evolutionary dynamics, or to state-dependent controllers known from the field of robotics. We find good agreement between theoretical predictions and agent-based simulations. By deriving fundamental control parameters and uncertainty relations, our work lays the foundations for a statistical physics analysis of decentralized learning.

Abstract: Van der Waals heterostructures have promised the realisation of artificial materials with multiple physical phenomena such as giant optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge interconversion in spintronics and topological carrier protection, in a single layered device through an infinitely diverse set of quantum materials. However, most efforts have only focused on exfoliated material that inherently limits both the dimensions of the materials and the scalability for applications. Here, we show the epitaxial growth of large area heterostructures of topological insulators (Bi2Se3), transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs, WSe2) and ferromagnets (Co), resulting in the combination of functionalities including tuneable optical nonlinearities, spin-to-charge conversion and magnetic proximity effects. This is demonstrated through coherent phase resolved terahertz currents, bringing novel functionalities beyond those achievable in simple homostructures. In particular, we show the role of different TMD polymorphs, with the simple change of one atomic monolayer of the artificial material stack entirely changing its optical, electrical and magnetic properties. This epitaxial integration of diverse two-dimensional materials offers foundational steps towards diverse perspectives in quantum material engineering, where the material polymorph can be controlled at technological relevant scales for coupling applications in, for example, van der Waals nonlinear optics, optoelectronics, spintronics, multiferroics and coherent current control.

Abstract: This study investigates the influence of various growth parameters on normal-state resistivity and superconducting transition temperature Tc of granular aluminum films. Specifically, we focus on the effects of oxygen flow and aluminum evaporation rate during the growth process conducted at different substrate temperatures, from 300 K down to 25 K. We report systematic correlations between the growth conditions, the normal-state resistivity, and Tc. Furthermore our findings provide insights into optimizing the superconducting characteristics of granular aluminum.

Title: Thermal Transport Properties of Magnons on the $\alpha$-T$_3$ Lattice
Authors: Luqman Saleem, Hasan M. Abdullah, Udo Schwingenschlogl, Aurelien Manchon
Abstract: We theoretically investigate magnons on the $\alpha$-T$_3$ lattice. Atomistic spin dynamics simulations show that next-nearest neighbor hopping and easy-axis anisotropy stabilize ferromagnetic order in the presence of Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction. We identify one topologically trivial magnon insulator phase and three magnon Chern insulator phases. The topologically trivial magnon insulator phase exhibits a small but non-zero magnon thermal Hall conductivity, while in the magnon Chern insulator phases the Chern number of the lowest magnon band dominates the magnon thermal Hall conductivity. The sign of the magnon thermal Hall conductivity does not change at the topological phase boundaries, but distinct changes are observed in the magnitude.

Title: Classical signatures of quenched and thermal disorder in the dynamics of correlated spin systems
Authors: Harry Lane, Kipton Barros, Martin Mourigal
Abstract: Neutron scattering is frequently used to look for evidence of features indicative of quantum-entangled phases of matter such as continua from fractionalisation or quantised excitations. However, the non-specificity of these features and difficulty of both fully quantum treatments and semiclassical models of disorder, make the diagnosis of such states problematic. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of semiclassical treatments of disordered systems for supercells of $\sim 10,000$ spins. By examining a number of classically disordered models we show the presence of quantised excitations, broad continua and anomalous damping originating from quenched disorder or large classical degeneracies.

Title: Supervised and unsupervised learning the many-body critical phase, phase transitions and critical exponents in disordered quantum systems
Authors: Aamna Ahmed, Nilanjan Roy
Abstract: In this work, we begin by questioning the existence of a new kind of nonergodic extended phase, namely, the many-body critical (MBC) phase in finite systems of an interacting quasiperiodic system. We find that this phase can be separately detected from the other phases such as the many-body ergodic (ME) and many-body localized (MBL) phases in the model through supervised neural networks made for both binary and multi-class classification tasks, utilizing, rather un-preprocessed, eigenvalue spacings and eigenvector probability densities as input features. Moreover, the output of our trained neural networks can also indicate the critical points separating ME, MBC and MBL phases, which are consistent with the same obtained from other conventional methods. We also employ unsupervised learning techniques, particularly principal component analysis (PCA) of eigenvector probability densities to investigate how this framework, without any training, captures the, rather unknown, many-body phases (ME, MBL and MBC) and single particle phases (delocalized, localized and critical) of the interacting and non-interacting systems, respectively. Our findings reveal that PCA entropy serves as an effective indicator (order parameter) for detecting phase transitions in the single-particle systems. Moreover, this method proves applicable to many-body systems when the data undergoes a suitable pre-processing. Interestingly, when it comes to extraction of critical (correlation length) exponents through a finite size-scaling, we find that for single-particle systems, scaling collapse of neural network outputs is obtained using components of inverse participation ratio (IPR) as input data. Remarkably, we observe identical critical exponents as obtained from scaling collapse of the IPR directly for different single-particle phase transitions.

Title: Matters Arising from S. Vaitiekenas et al., "Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires" Nature Physics 2021
Authors: C. Riggert, M. Gupta, Y. Jiang, V. S. Pribiag, V. Mourik, S. M. Frolov
Abstract: In 2021 Nature Physics published a paper by Vaitiekenas, Liu, Krogstrup and Marcus titled "Zero-bias peaks at zero magnetic field in ferromagnetic hybrid nanowires". The paper reports low temperature transport measurements on semiconductor InAs nanowires with two partly overlapping shells -- a shell of EuS, a magnetic insulator, and a shell of Al, a metal that becomes superconducting at temperatures below 1.2K. The paper claims that (1) the data are consistent with induced topological superconductivity and Majorana zero modes (MZMs), and (2) that this is facilitated by the breaking of the time reversal symmetry through a direct magnetic interaction with the EuS shell. In this Matters Arising, we present an alternative explanation which is based on trivial effects that are likely to appear in the reported geometry. Specifically, first, we find that data the authors present in support of the topological superconductivity claim can originate from unintended quantum dots in their devices, a widely known likely explanation that is not being discussed in the paper. Second, our analysis of the setup, supported by our numerical micromagnetic simulations, shows similar effects could be obtained due to stray magnetic fields from the region of the EuS shell damaged during Al etching. This basic picture should come before the exotic interpretation in terms of magnetic exchange interaction with a ferromagnetic insulator.

Title: Two-fluid mobility model from coupled hydrodynamic equations for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches
Authors: Qile Wu, Antonín Sojka, Brad D. Price, Nikolay I. Agladze, Anup Yadav, Sophie L. Pain, John D. Murphy, Tim Niewelt, Mark S. Sherwin
Abstract: We introduce a two-fluid mobility model incorporating fundamental aspects of electron-hole (e-h) scattering such as momentum conservation for simulating laser-driven semiconductor switches (LDSSs). Compared to previous works that use Matthiessen's rule, the two-fluid mobility model predicts distinct AC responses of e-h plasmas in semiconductors. Based on the two-fluid mobility model, we develop a theory with very few adjustable parameters for simulating the switching performance of LDSSs based on high-purity indirect-gap semiconductors such as silicon (Si). As a prototypical application, we successfully reproduce experimentally measured reflectance at around 320 GHz in a laser-driven Si switch. By injecting e-h plasmas with densities up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$, we reveal the importance of carrier-screening effects in e-h scattering and Auger recombination for carrier densities above the critical carrier density for exciton-plasma Mott transition. Our results also suggest a way to characterize the intrinsic momentum-relaxation mechanism, e-h scattering, and the intrinsic e-h recombination mechanism in indirect-gap semiconductors, Auger recombination. We reassess the ambipolar Auger coefficient of high-purity Si with high injection levels of e-h plasmas up to $10^{20}\,\rm cm^{-3}$ and find a minimal value of $1.8\times10^{-41}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$. The value is more than one order of magnitude smaller than the ambipolar Auger coefficient widely used for simulating LDSSs, $3.8\times10^{-40}\,{\rm cm^6/ns}$, which was deduced from minority-carrier lifetime in highly doped silicon more than four decades ago.

Abstract: Neural networks based on soft and biological matter constitute an interesting potential alternative to traditional implementations based on electric circuits. DNA is a particularly promising system in this context due its natural ability to store information. In recent years, researchers have started to construct neural networks that are based on DNA. In this chapter, I provide a very basic introduction to the concept of DNA neural networks, aiming at an audience that is not familiar with biochemistry.

Title: Advanced Displacement Magnitude Prediction in Multi-Material Architected Lattice Structure Beams Using Physics Informed Neural Network Architecture
Authors: Akshansh Mishra
Abstract: This paper proposes an innovative method for predicting deformation in architected lattice structures that combines Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) with finite element analysis. A thorough study was carried out on FCC-based lattice beams utilizing five different materials (Structural Steel, AA6061, AA7075, Ti6Al4V, and Inconel 718) under varied edge loads (1000-10000 N). The PINN model blends data-driven learning with physics-based limitations via a proprietary loss function, resulting in much higher prediction accuracy than linear regression. PINN outperforms linear regression, achieving greater R-square (0.7923 vs 0.5686) and lower error metrics (MSE: 0.00017417 vs 0.00036187). Among the materials examined, AA6061 had the highest displacement sensitivity (0.1014 mm at maximum load), while Inconel718 had better structural stability.

Title: Evolved Quantum Boltzmann Machines
Authors: Michele Minervini, Dhrumil Patel, Mark M. Wilde
Abstract: We introduce evolved quantum Boltzmann machines as a variational ansatz for quantum optimization and learning tasks. Given two parameterized Hamiltonians $G(\theta)$ and $H(\phi)$, an evolved quantum Boltzmann machine consists of preparing a thermal state of the first Hamiltonian $G(\theta)$ followed by unitary evolution according to the second Hamiltonian $H(\phi)$. Alternatively, one can think of it as first realizing imaginary time evolution according to $G(\theta)$ followed by real time evolution according to $H(\phi)$. After defining this ansatz, we provide analytical expressions for the gradient vector and illustrate their application in ground-state energy estimation and generative modeling, showing how the gradient for these tasks can be estimated by means of quantum algorithms that involve classical sampling, Hamiltonian simulation, and the Hadamard test. We also establish analytical expressions for the Fisher-Bures, Wigner-Yanase, and Kubo-Mori information matrix elements of evolved quantum Boltzmann machines, as well as quantum algorithms for estimating each of them, which leads to at least three different general natural gradient descent algorithms based on this ansatz. Along the way, we establish a broad generalization of the main result of [Luo, Proc. Am. Math. Soc. 132, 885 (2004)], proving that the Fisher-Bures and Wigner-Yanase information matrices of general parameterized families of states differ by no more than a factor of two in the matrix (Loewner) order, making them essentially interchangeable for training when using natural gradient descent.

Title: Inductively coupled Josephson junctions: a platform for rich neuromorphic dynamics
Authors: J. Hizanidis, G. Baxevanis
Abstract: Josephson junctions (JJs) are by nature neuromorphic hardware devices capable of mimicking excitability and spiking dynamics. When coupled together or combined with other superconducting elements, they can emulate additional behaviors found in biological neurons. From a technological point of view, JJ-based neuromorphic systems are particularly appealing since they present THz-speed processing and they operate with near-zero power dissipation. In this work we study a system of inductively coupled JJs and focus on the nonlinear dynamical aspects of its neurocomputational properties. In particular, we report on spiking behavior, synchronization, first spike latency effects, and multistability. Special emphasis is placed on the bursting dynamics this system is capable of reproducing, and a new underlying mechanism is proposed beyond the approach followed in prior works.

Title: Energy injection in an epithelial cell monolayer via negative viscosity
Authors: Molly McCord, Jacob Notbohm
Abstract: Active fluids are driven out of thermodynamic equilibrium by internally generated forces, causing complex patterns of motion. Even when both the forces and motion are measurable, it is not yet possible to relate the two, because the sources of energy injection and dissipation are often unclear. Here, we study how energy is transferred by developing a method to measure viscosity from the shear stresses and strain rates within an epithelial cell monolayer. Surprisingly, there emerged multicellular regions in which the relationship between shear stress and shear strain rate was negatively proportional, indicating a negative viscosity. We provide direct experimental evidence that the negative viscosity results from cells aligning their stresses with the orientation of the flow. Regions of negative viscosity consistently exhibited greater cell speed and vorticity, and the cells had elevated metabolic activity, indicating that negative viscosity is a mechanism for injection of surplus energy. More broadly, our study shows that negative viscosity is a useful means of quantifying the flow of energy in active materials.

Title: Text to Band Gap: Pre-trained Language Models as Encoders for Semiconductor Band Gap Prediction
Authors: Ying-Ting Yeh, Janghoon Ock, Amir Barati Farimani
Abstract: In this study, we explore the use of a transformer-based language model as an encoder to predict the band gaps of semiconductor materials directly from their text descriptions. Quantum chemistry simulations, including Density Functional Theory (DFT), are computationally intensive and time-consuming, which limits their practicality for high-throughput material screening, particularly for complex systems. Shallow machine learning (ML) models, while effective, often require extensive data preprocessing to convert non-numerical material properties into numerical inputs. In contrast, our approach leverages textual data directly, bypassing the need for complex feature engineering. We generate material descriptions in two formats: formatted strings combining features and natural language text generated using the ChatGPT API. We demonstrate that the RoBERTa model, pre-trained on natural language processing tasks, performs effectively as an encoder for prediction tasks. With minimal fine-tuning, it achieves a mean absolute error (MAE) of approximately 0.33 eV, performing better than shallow machine learning models such as Support Vector Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost. Even when only the linear regression head is trained while keeping the RoBERTa encoder layers frozen, the accuracy remains nearly identical to that of the fully trained model. This demonstrates that the pre-trained RoBERTa encoder is highly adaptable for processing domain-specific text related to material properties, such as the band gap, significantly reducing the need for extensive retraining. This study highlights the potential of transformer-based language models to serve as efficient and versatile encoders for semiconductor materials property prediction tasks.

Title: Zeno Freezing and Anti-Zeno Acceleration of the Dynamic Evolution of Acoustic Topological Boundary States
Authors: Xiao-Meng Zhang, Ze-Guo Chen, Guancong Ma, Ming-Hui Lu, Yan-Feng Chen
Abstract: Quantum measurements severely disrupt the dynamic evolution of a quantum system by collapsing the probabilistic wavefunction. This principle can be leveraged to control quantum states by effectively freezing the system's dynamics or enhancing transitions between states. These are known as the quantum Zeno effect (ZE) and anti-Zeno effect (AZE), respectively. However, it remains elusive how quantum measurements affect topological states, which are famous for their robustness against disorder and perturbations. Here, we theoretically and experimentally show that the dynamic evolution of topological boundary states (TBSs) can be controlled by quantum-like measurement (QLM). Our work is based on spatially modulated topological acoustic waveguide systems with varying parameters that adiabatically pump the TBS across the bulk to the opposite boundary. Therein, the QLM is emulated using a perturbation to the Hamiltonian known as the Zeno subspace. With the help of quantum metrics, we identify the general conditions for ZE and AZE, and experimentally demonstrate their effects in freezing and accelerating the tunneling of the TBS. Furthermore, we discover a tunneling mechanism by varying the strength of the QLM. These results highlight QLM as a versatile tool for manipulating topological states and wave propagation.

Title: Simulation on the Miniaturization and Performance Improvement Study of Gr/MoS2 Based Vertical Field Effect Transistor
Authors: Sirsendu Ghosh, Anamika Devi Laishram, Pramod Kumar
Abstract: Vertical field effect transistors (VFETs) show many advantages such as high switching speed, low operating voltage, low power consumption, and miniaturization over lateral FETs. However, VFET still faces the main challenges of high off-state current. Graphene (Gr) and transition metal di-chalcogenides (TMDs) are attractive materials for the next generation electronics. In this simulation work, the bulk molybdenum disulfide (MoS2) is sandwiched between perforated monolayer Gr which acts as the source electrode, and aluminum (Al) as the top drain electrode. In addition to this, the minimization of the off-state current is carried out by modifications in the source contact geometry by insulating some part of the source electrode and introducing the extra MoS2 layer between the source and gate dielectric named as buried layer. After the modification, the results show an improvement in OFF current, hence the ON/OFF ratio. The highest ON/OFF ratio of 109 is achieved with top side insulated source contact and thinnest buried layer of 02 nm with top and sidewall insulation. These results would support low voltage operation with high switching speed in complete 2D material based VFETs and further miniaturize its geometry.

Title: Splitting dynamics of quantized composite vortices in holographic miscible binary superfluids
Authors: Yuping An, Li Li
Abstract: The stability properties and splitting dynamics of multiply quantized vortices are the subject of interest in both theoretical and experimental investigations. Going beyond the regime of validity of Gross-Pitaevskii equation (GPE), we study the composite vortices in miscible strongly interacting binary superfluids by employing a holographic model that naturally incorporate finite temperature and dissipation. The composite vortices is classified in terms of an integer pair $(S_1, S_2)$ of phase winding numbers and can share the same vortex core, while either co-rotating or counter-rotating, leading to very diverse vortex structures. We uncover different dynamical behaviors compared to results from GPE that is valid in weak coupling limit and zero temperature. In particular, we show that the occurrence of dynamic instabilities and the instability strength are sensitive to the temperature. We identify several temperature dependent dynamical transitions in $(1,1)$, $(2,\pm 1)$ and $(2,2)$ vortices. The splitting behaviors associated with different multipolarities are demonstrated by solving the full-time evolution for slightly perturbed composite vortices. We find that the final states of all composite vortices are generally singly quantized vortices, and no additional long living vortex is formed due to strong dissipation. Our results highlight the important role of temperature and the distinction between dynamics of composite vortices in weakly interacting superfluids without dissipation and strongly interacting case with dissipation, shedding a new light on the understanding of quantum vortex and dynamical instabilities in multicomponent superfluids.

Title: Exact Decoding of Repetition Code under Circuit Level Noise
Authors: Hanyan Cao, Shoukuan Zhao, Dongyang Feng, Zisong Shen, Haisheng Yan, Tang Su, Weijie Sun, Huikai Xu, Feng Pan, Haifeng Yu, Pan Zhang
Abstract: Repetition code forms a fundamental basis for quantum error correction experiments. To date, it stands as the sole code that has achieved large distances and extremely low error rates. Its applications span the spectrum of evaluating hardware limitations, pinpointing hardware defects, and detecting rare events. However, current methods for decoding repetition codes under circuit level noise are suboptimal, leading to inaccurate error correction thresholds and introducing additional errors in event detection. In this work, we establish that repetition code under circuit level noise has an exact solution, and we propose an optimal maximum likelihood decoding algorithm called planar. The algorithm is based on the exact solution of the spin glass partition function on planar graphs and has polynomial computational complexity. Through extensive numerical experiments, we demonstrate that our algorithm uncovers the exact threshold for depolarizing noise and realistic superconductor SI1000 noise. Furthermore, we apply our method to analyze data from recent quantum memory experiments conducted by Google Quantum AI, revealing that part of the error floor was attributed to the decoding algorithm used by Google. Finally, we implemented the repetition code quantum memory on superconducting systems with a 72-qubit quantum chip lacking reset gates, demonstrating that even with an unknown error model, the proposed algorithm achieves a significantly lower logical error rate than the matching-based algorithm.

Title: Single-molecule Scale Magnetic Resonance Spectroscopy using Nitrogen-Vacancy Centers in Diamond
Authors: Jiangfeng Du, Fazhan Shi, Xi Kong, Fedor Jekezko, Jörg Wrachtrup
Abstract: Single-molecule technology stands as a powerful tool, enabling the characterization of intricate structural and dynamic information that would otherwise remain concealed within the averaged behaviors of numerous molecules. This technology finds extensive application across diverse fields including physics, chemistry, biology, and medicine. Quantum sensing, particularly leveraging nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers within diamond structures, presents a promising avenue for single-molecule magnetic resonance, offering prospects for sensing and imaging technology at the single-molecule level. Notably, while significant strides have been made in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance using NV centers over the past two decades, current approaches still exhibit limitations in magnetic sensitivity, spectral resolution, and spatial resolution. Particularly, the full reconstruction of three-dimensional positions of nuclear spins within single molecules remains an unattained goal. This review provides a comprehensive overview of the current state-of-the-art in single-molecule scale magnetic resonance, encompassing an analysis of various relevant techniques involving NV centers. Additionally, it explores the optimization of technical parameters associated with these methods. This detailed analysis serves as a foundation for the development of new technologies and the exploration of potential applications.

Title: Spin Environment of a Superconducting Qubit in High Magnetic Fields
Authors: S. Günzler, J. Beck, D. Rieger, N. Gosling, N. Zapata, M. Field, S. Geisert, A. Bacher, J. K. Hohmann, M. Spiecker, W. Wernsdorfer, I. M. Pop
Abstract: Superconducting qubits equipped with quantum non-demolishing readout and active feedback can be used as information engines to probe and manipulate microscopic degrees of freedom, whether intentionally designed or naturally occurring in their environment. In the case of spin systems, the required magnetic field bias presents a challenge for superconductors and Josephson junctions. Here we demonstrate a granular aluminum nanojunction fluxonium qubit (gralmonium) with spectrum and coherence resilient to fields beyond one Tesla. Sweeping the field reveals a paramagnetic spin-1/2 ensemble, which is the dominant gralmonium loss mechanism when the electron spin resonance matches the qubit. We also observe a suppression of fast flux noise in magnetic field, suggesting the freezing of surface spins. Using an active state stabilization sequence, the qubit hyperpolarizes long-lived two-level systems (TLSs) in its environment, previously speculated to be spins. Surprisingly, the coupling to these TLSs is unaffected by magnetic fields, leaving the question of their origin open. The robust operation of gralmoniums in Tesla fields offers new opportunities to explore unresolved questions in spin environment dynamics and facilitates hybrid architectures linking superconducting qubits with spin systems.

Title: Electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence based on the formation of charge-transfer excimers
Authors: Chang-Ki Moon Yuka Yasuda, Yu Kusakabe, Anna Popczyk, Shohei Fukushima, Julian F. Butscher, Hironori Kaji, Malte C. Gather
Abstract: Despite the extensive use of electrochemiluminescence in sensing applications, its potential in lighting and display technology has been constrained by the low luminance and short operational lifetime of electrochemiluminescence devices (ECLDs). Here, we demonstrate a substantial enhancement in the luminance, efficiency, and operational longevity of ECLDs by introducing electrochemically induced hyperfluorescence (ECiHF) via electrogeneration of charge-transfer (CT) excimers and subsequent energy transfer to fluorescent acceptors. By assuming a double-decker arrangement of the electron donor and acceptor groups, the molecule TpAT-tFFO supports solution-state thermally activated delayed fluorescence from a CT excimer state and efficient energy transfer to the rubrene dye TBRb. Optimized ECLDs based on this material combination achieve an unprecedented luminance of 6,220 cd/m2 and their operational lifetime (LT50) at an initial luminance of 100 cd/m2 exceeds 20 minutes, more than 10-fold longer than other ECLDs with meaningful efficiency or brightness. We identify energy level alignment between the excimer and the emitter as a crucial factor for efficient ECiHF. In mixtures with energy gaps > 0.5 eV, electron transfer results in reduced performance and renders the operation strongly dependent on applied voltage and frequency. By contrast, spectroelectrochemical analysis reveals that devices with favorable energy level alignment operate on a pure excimer mechanism across a wide range of frequencies. These findings highlight the innovative potential of ECiHF in improving the performance of ECLD, which can be widely applied in future commercial lighting solutions.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of Calogero-Sutherland fluids
Authors: Fedrico L. Bottesi, Guillermo R. Zemba
Abstract: The effective extended conformal field theory with symmetry W_infinity*{bar W_infinity} that describes the thermodynamic limit of the Calogero-Sutherland model is considered. The dynamic structure factor of the chiral component in the repulsive regime is determined and compared with the corresponding one of the free bosonic theory, given that both share isomorphic Hilbert spaces but differ in the time evolution of quantum states. In either case, a sharp response function peaked at only one resonant frequency is found, and the physical implications of this outcome are addressed. Furthermore, a detailed comparison between this result and the corresponding one obtained in the first quantized formulation of the Calogero-Sutherland model is provided. Complete agreement in the parameter region in which both results overlap is found. This outcome provides further support to the equivalence between the first and second quantized treatments of the Calogero-Sutherland model, in which the computational advantages from integrability in the first formulation are paralleled by those from the algebraic structure of the second.

Title: Critical properties in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark model
Authors: Ji-Long Dong, En-Wen Liang, Shi-Yang Liu, Guo-Qing Zhang, Ling-Zhi Tang, Dan-Wei Zhang
Abstract: We explore the critical properties of the localization transition in the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre-Stark (AAS) model with quasiperiodic and Stark potentials, where the non-Hermiticity comes from the nonreciprocal hopping. The localization length, the inverse participation ratio and the energy gap are adopted as the characteristic quantities. We perform the scaling analysis to derive the scaling functions of the three quantities with critical exponents in several critical regions, with respect to the quasiperiodic and Stark potentials and the nonreciprocal strength. We numerically verify the finite-size scaling forms and extract the critical exponents in different situations. Two groups of new critical exponents for the non-Hermitian AAS model and its pure Stark limit are obtained, which are distinct to those for the non-Hermitian Aubry-Andre model and their Hermitian counterparts. Our results indicate that the Hermitian and non-Hermitian AAS, Aubry-Andre, and Stark models belong to different universality classes. We demonstrate that these critical exponents are independent of the nonreciprocal strength, and remain the same in different critical regions and boundary conditions. Furthermore, we establish a hybrid scaling function with a hybrid exponent in the overlap region between the critical regions for the non-Hermitian AAS and Stark models.

Abstract: The Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation for magnetization dynamics is recast into spinor form using the real-valued Clifford algebra (geometric algebra) of three-space. We show how the undamped case can be explicitly solved to obtain component-wise solutions, with clear geometrical meaning. Generalizations of the approach to include damping are formulated. The implications of the axial property of the magnetization vector are briefly discussed.

Title: Red blood cells aggregates transport for finite concentration
Authors: Mehdi Abbasi, Chaouqi Misbah
Abstract: Red blood cells (RBCs) are responsible for transporting oxygen and various metabolites to tissues and organs, as well as removing waste. Several cardiovascular diseases can impair these functions. For instance, in diabetes, increased RBC aggregation can lead to blood occlusion, thereby depriving tissues of efficient oxygen delivery. Interestingly, RBC adhesion occurs not only in disease states but also under physiological conditions, with the key difference being that adhesion is reversible in healthy situations. This paper focuses on numerical simulations in 2D, exploring different adhesion energies (both physiological and pathological) alongside varying flow strengths and hematocrit levels. A systematic analysis of RBC flux and viscosity is conducted. A remarkable finding is that moderate adhesion energy (within the physiological range) enhances RBC transport, thereby improving oxygen delivery to tissues. This provides insight into why RBC adhesion is present under normal conditions. Conversely, increasing adhesion energy beyond a certain point causes a collapse in RBC flux, thus reducing oxygen transport. We provide a basic explanation for the non-monotonic effect of adhesion energy on blood flow efficiency. This finding serves as an initial step in understanding the impact (both positive and negative) of RBC adhesion before addressing this issue in complex networks inspired by realistic microvasculatures.

Title: A precise asymptotic analysis of learning diffusion models: theory and insights
Authors: Hugo Cui, Cengiz Pehlevan, Yue M. Lu
Abstract: In this manuscript, we consider the problem of learning a flow or diffusion-based generative model parametrized by a two-layer auto-encoder, trained with online stochastic gradient descent, on a high-dimensional target density with an underlying low-dimensional manifold structure. We derive a tight asymptotic characterization of low-dimensional projections of the distribution of samples generated by the learned model, ascertaining in particular its dependence on the number of training samples. Building on this analysis, we discuss how mode collapse can arise, and lead to model collapse when the generative model is re-trained on generated synthetic data.

Title: Shapiro Steps Observed in a Two-Dimensional Yukawa Solid Modulated by a One-Dimensional Vibrational Periodic Substrate
Authors: Zhaoye Wang, Nichen Yu, C. Reichhardt, C.J.O. Reichhardt, Ao Xu, Xin Chen, Yan Feng
Abstract: Depinning dynamics of a two-dimensional (2D) solid dusty plasma modulated by a one-dimensional (1D) vibrational periodic substrate are investigated using Langevin dynamical simulations. As the uniform driving force increases gradually, from the overall drift velocity varying with the driving force, four significant Shapiro steps are discovered. The data analysis indicate that, when the ratio of the frequency from the drift motion over potential wells to the external frequency from the modulation substrate is close to integers, dynamic mode locking occurs, corresponding to the discovered Shapiro steps. Around both termini of the first and fourth Shapiro steps, the transitions are found to be always continuous, however, the transition between the second and third Shapiro steps is discontinuous, probably due to the different arrangements of particles.

Title: Gigantic current control of coercive field and magnetic memory based on nm-thin ferromagnetic van der Waals Fe3GeTe2
Authors: Kaixuan Zhang, Seungyun Han, Youjin Lee, Matthew J. Coak, Junghyun Kim, Inho Hwang, Suhan Son, Jeacheol Shin, Mijin Lim, Daegeun Jo, Kyoo Kim, Dohun Kim, Hyun-Woo Lee, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Controlling magnetic states by a small current is essential for the next-generation of energy-efficient spintronic devices. However, it invariably requires considerable energy to change a magnetic ground state of intrinsically quantum nature governed by fundamental Hamiltonian, once stabilized below a phase transition temperature. We report that surprisingly an in-plane current can tune the magnetic state of nm-thin van der Waals ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2 from a hard magnetic state to a soft magnetic state. It is the direct demonstration of the current-induced substantial reduction of the coercive field. This surprising finding is possible because the in-plane current produces a highly unusual type of gigantic spin-orbit torque for Fe3GeTe2. And we further demonstrate a working model of a new nonvolatile magnetic memory based on the principle of our discovery in Fe3GeTe2, controlled by a tiny current. Our findings open up a new window of exciting opportunities for magnetic van der Waals materials with potentially huge impacts on the future development of spintronic and magnetic memory.

Title: Highly efficient nonvolatile magnetization switching and multi-level states by current in single van der Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2

Abstract: Robust multi-level spin memory with the ability to write information electrically is a long-sought capability in spintronics, with great promise for applications. Here we achieve nonvolatile and highly energy-efficient magnetization switching in a single-material device formed of van-der-Waals topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2, whose magnetic information can be readily controlled by a tiny current. Furthermore, the switching current density and power dissipation are about 400 and 4000 times smaller than those of the existing spin-orbit-torque magnetic random access memory based on conventional magnet/heavy-metal systems. Most importantly, we also demonstrate multi-level states, switched by electrical current, which can dramatically enhance the information capacity density and reduce computing costs. Thus, our observations combine both high energy efficiency and large information capacity density in one device, showcasing the potential applications of the emerging field of van-der-Waals magnets in the field of spin memory and spintronics.

Title: Parsimonious inertial cavitation rheometry via bubble collapse time
Authors: Zhiren Zhu, Sawyer Remillard, Bachir A. Abeid, Danila Frolkin, Spencer H. Bryngelson, Jin Yang, Mauro Rodriguez Jr., Jonathan B. Estrada
Abstract: The rapid and accurate characterization of soft, viscoelastic materials at high strain rates is of interest in biological and engineering applications such as assessing the extent of non-invasive tissue surgery completion and developing injury criteria for the mitigation of blast injuries. The inertial microcavitation rheometry technique (IMR, Estrada et al. 2018) allows for the minimally invasive characterization of local viscoelastic properties at strain rates up to 1E8 per second. However, IMR relies on bright-field videography of a sufficiently translucent sample at approximately 1 million frames per second and a simulation-dependent fit optimization process that can require hours of post-processing. We present an IMR-style technique that parsimoniously characterizes viscoelastic models. The approach uses experimental advancements to accurately estimate the time to first collapse of the laser-induced cavity. A theoretical energy balance analysis yields an approximate collapse time based on the material viscoelasticity parameters. The method closely matches the accuracy of the original IMR procedure while decreasing the computational cost from hours to seconds for the Kelvin--Voigt model and potentially reducing dependence on high-speed videography. This technique can enable nearly real-time characterization of a broader range of soft, viscoelastic hydrogels and biological materials.

Title: Voltage-driven 90 switching of bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy in ferrimagnets

Abstract: Unravelling the mechanism behind bulk perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) in amorphous rare earth-transition metal films has proven challenging. This is largely due to the inherent complexity of amorphous structure and the entangled potential origins arising from microstructure and atomic structure factors. Here, we present an approach wherein the magneto-electric effect is harnessed to induce 90° switching of bulk PMA in Tb-Co films to in-plane directions by applying voltages of only -1.2 V. This manipulation is achieved by voltage-driven insertion of hydrogen atoms into interstitial sites between Tb and Co atoms, which serves as a perturbation to local atomic structure. Using angle-dependent X-ray magnetic circular dichroism, we find that the anisotropy switching originates from the distortion of crystal field around Tb which reorients the alignment of Tb orbital moments. Initially aligned along Tb-Co bonding directions, the easy magnetization axis undergoes reorientation and switches by 90°, as substantiated by ab-initio calculations. Our study not only concludes the atomic origin of Tb-Co atom bonding configuration in shaping bulk PMA, but also establishes the groundwork for electrically programmable ferrimagnetic spintronics, such as controlling domain wall motion and programming artificial spin textures.

Title: Intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current from Zeeman quantum geometry
Authors: Longjun Xiang, Jinxiong Jia, Fuming Xu, Zhenhua Qiao, Jian Wang
Abstract: Quantum geometric tensor (QGT), which is usually obtained by evaluating the quantum distance between Bloch states parametrized by momentum, plays a key role in exploring the exotic responses of quantum materials. Herein, we revisit the concept of QGT by further taking into account the spin degree of freedom. Besides the conventional QGT relating to momentum translation, we uncover a new QGT (termed Zeeman QGT) relating to momentum translation as well as spin rotation, whose imaginary (real) part gives the Zeeman Berry curvature (quantum metric). Notably, we show that these novel quantum geometric quantities can drive an intrinsic gyrotropic magnetic current (IGMC) in spin-orbit coupled materials when the electron spin is steered by an oscillating magnetic field. With symmetry analysis, we show that a wide range of materials can support the IGMC, as illustrated by model calculations. Finally, we discuss the experimental aspects of detecting the IGMC driven by Zeeman QGT.

Title: Broken inversion symmetry in van der Waals topological ferromagnetic metal iron germanium telluride
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Hwiin Ju, Hyuncheol Kim, Jingyuan Cui, Jihoon Keum, Je-Geun Park, Jong Seok Lee
Abstract: Inversion symmetry breaking is critical for many quantum effects and fundamental for spin-orbit torque, which is crucial for next-generation spintronics. Recently, a novel type of gigantic intrinsic spin-orbit torque has been established in the topological van-der-Waals (vdW) magnet iron germanium telluride. However, it remains a puzzle because no clear evidence exists for interlayer inversion symmetry breaking. Here, we report the definitive evidence of broken inversion symmetry in iron germanium telluride directly measured by the second harmonic generation (SHG) technique. Our data show that the crystal symmetry reduces from centrosymmetric P63/mmc to noncentrosymmetric polar P3m1 space group, giving the three-fold SHG pattern with dominant out-of-plane polarization. Additionally, the SHG response evolves from an isotropic pattern to a sharp three-fold symmetry upon increasing Fe deficiency, mainly due to the transition from random defects to ordered Fe vacancies. Such SHG response is robust against temperature, ensuring unaltered crystalline symmetries above and below the ferromagnetic transition temperature. These findings add crucial new information to our understanding of this interesting vdW metal, iron germanium telluride: band topology, intrinsic spin-orbit torque and topological vdW polar metal states.

Title: Electric field dependent thermal conductivity of relaxor ferroelectric PMN-33PT through changes in the phonon spectrum
Authors: Delaram Rashadfar, Brandi L. Wooten, Joseph P. Heremans
Abstract: In ferroelectric materials, an electric field has been shown to change the phonon dispersion sufficiently to alter the lattice thermal conductivity, opening the possibility that a heat gradient could drive a polarization flux, and technologically, also opening a pathway towards voltage-driven, all solid-state heat switching. In this report, we confirm the validity of the theory originally developed for Pb(Zr,Ti)O_3 (PZT) on the ferroelectric relaxor 0.67Pb[Mg_(1/3)Nb_(2/3)]O_3-0.33PbTiO_3 (PMN-33PT). In the theory, the change in sound velocity and thermal conductivity with electric field relates to the piezoelectric coefficients and the Gruneisen parameter. It predicts that in PMN-33PT the effect should be an order of magnitude larger, and of opposite sign as in PZT; this is confirmed here experimentally. The effects are measured on samples never poled before and on samples that underwent multiple field sweep cycles and passed through two phase transitions with change in temperature. The thermal conductivity changes are linked to variations in the piezoelectric coefficients and can be as large as 8-11% at room temperature and above. To date, this is the only means of heat conduction modulation that utilizes changes in the phonon spectrum. While this technology is in its infancy, it offers another path to future active thermal conduction control.

Title: Unexpected versatile electrical transport behaviors of ferromagnetic nickel films
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Hanshu Xu, Jihoon Keum, Xiangqi Wang, Meizhuang Liu, Zuxin Chen
Abstract: Perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA) of magnets is paramount for electrically controlled spintronics due to their intrinsic potentials for higher memory density, scalability, thermal stability and endurance, surpassing an in-plane magnetic anisotropy (IMA). Nickel film is a long-lived fundamental element ferromagnet, yet its electrical transport behavior associated with magnetism has not been comprehensively studied, hindering corresponding spintronic applications exploiting nickel-based compounds. Here, we systematically investigate the highly versatile magnetism and corresponding transport behavior of nickel films. As the thickness reduces within the general thickness regime of a magnet layer for a memory device, the hardness of nickel films' ferromagnetic loop of anomalous Hall effect increases and then decreases, reflecting the magnetic transitions from IMA to PMA and back to IMA. Additionally, the square ferromagnetic loop changes from a hard to a soft one at rising temperatures, indicating a shift from PMA to IMA. Furthermore, we observe a butterfly magnetoresistance resulting from the anisotropic magnetoresistance effect, which evolves in conjunction with the thickness and temperature-dependent magnetic transformations as a complementary support. Our findings unveil the rich magnetic dynamics and most importantly settle down the most useful guiding information for current-driven spintronic applications based on nickel film: The hysteresis loop is squarest for the ~8 nm-thick nickel film, of highest hardness with Rxyr/Rxys~1 and minimum Hs-Hc, up to 125 K; otherwise, extra care should be taken for a different thickness or at a higher temperature.

Title: Dynamical Reversibility and A New Theory of Causal Emergence based on SVD
Authors: Jiang Zhang, Ruyi Tao, Keng Hou Leong, Mingzhe Yang, Bing Yuan
Abstract: The theory of causal emergence (CE) with effective information (EI) posits that complex systems can exhibit CE, where macro-dynamics show stronger causal effects than micro-dynamics. A key challenge of this theory is its dependence on coarse-graining method. In this paper, we introduce a fresh concept of approximate dynamical reversibility and establish a novel framework for CE based on this. By applying singular value decomposition(SVD) to Markov dynamics, we find that the essence of CE lies in the presence of redundancy, represented by the irreversible and correlated information pathways. Therefore, CE can be quantified as the potential maximal efficiency increase for dynamical reversibility or information transmission. We also demonstrate a strong correlation between the approximate dynamical reversibility and EI, establishing an equivalence between the SVD and EI maximization frameworks for quantifying CE, supported by theoretical insights and numerical examples from Boolean networks, cellular automata, and complex networks. Importantly, our SVD-based CE framework is independent of specific coarse-graining techniques and effectively captures the fundamental characteristics of the dynamics.

Title: All van der Waals three-terminal SOT-MRAM realized by topological ferromagnet Fe3GeTe2
Authors: Jingyuan Cui, Kai-Xuan Zhang, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: Magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials have attracted massive attention because of their academic interest and application potential for the past few years. Its main advantage is the intrinsic two-dimensionality, enabling much smaller devices of novel concepts. One particular exciting direction lies in the current-driven spin-orbit torque (SOT). Here, we, for the first time, realize an all vdW three-terminal SOT memory, employing the unique physics principle of gigantic intrinsic SOT of Fe3GeTe2 (FGT) and the well-known industry-adopted tunnelling magnetoresistance (TMR) effect. We designed the device operation procedure and fabricated the FGT/h-BN/FGT vdW heterostructure as a proof of concept. This device exhibits a classical TMR effect and unambiguously demonstrates the conception by precise performance as expected: the magnetic information of the top-FGT is written by current-driven SOT and read out by TMR separately. The writing and reading current paths are physically decoupled, enhancing the design and optimization flexibility substantially and further strengthening the device's endurance naturally. Our work would prompt more expansive use of vdW magnets for spintronic applications.

Title: Critical behavior of Non-Hermitian Kondo effect in a pseudogap system
Authors: Jiasong Chen
Abstract: A combined study of non-Hermitian physics and strong correlations can yield numerous intriguing effects. Authors of a previous study on the non-Hermitian Kondo model in the ultracold atoms reported the reversion of the renormalization group (RG) flow. In this paper, we investigate the non-Hermitian Kondo effect in the system with a specific form of density of states $\rho (\omega) \sim |\omega|^{r}(r>0)$, known as the pseudogap system. We find that, for $r<\frac{1}{2}$, our results from perturbative RG are consistent with those of the Hermitian pseudogap Kondo effect. For $r=\frac{1}{2}$, a fixed point with the reversion property emerges in the RG flow. For $r>\frac{1}{2}$, an unstable fixed point appears in the complex plane of the parameter space. Furthermore, through the large-$N$ expansion, we validate the RG results for $r < \frac{1}{2}$, finding that the self-consistent equations have non-trivial solutions in a specific region of the complex plane of the parameter space.

Title: Electronic Structure of Molybdenene
Authors: Ashkan Shekaari
Abstract: Density functional theory has been applied to investigate structural and electronic properties of molybdenene monolayer in both its hexagonal and triclinic eigenstructures, within ultrasoft pseudopotential approach. In agreement with experimental findings, it has been found that either phase of molybdenene is metallic Dirac material, known as metallic relative of graphene. Partial density of state analysis has revealed that the $d$ valence orbitals of molybdenum atoms have had the largest contribution to such a metallic property, due to being half-empty and being the outermost. Phonon-dispersion calculations also have led to negative frequencies or soft modes for both eigenstructures, showing their instability in terms of lattice dynamics, as reported in experimental literature.

Title: Linear differential equation approach to the Loschmidt amplitude
Authors: Michael Vogl
Abstract: The Loschmidt echo is a popular quantity that allows making predictions about the stability of quantum states under time evolution. In our work, we present an approach that allows us to find a differential equation that can be used to compute the Loschmidt echo. This approach, while in essence perturbative, has the advantage that it converges at finite order. We demonstrate that the approach for generically chosen matrix Hamiltonians often offers advantages over Taylor and cumulant expansions even when we truncate at finite order. We then apply the approach to two ordinary band Hamiltonians (multi-Weyl semimetals and AB bilayer graphene) to obtain the Loschmidt echo after a quench for an arbitrary starting state and find that the results readily generalize to find transmission amplitudes and specific contributions to the partition function, too. We then test our methods on many body spin and fermionic Hamiltonians and find that while the approach still offers advantages, more care has to be taken than in a generic case.

Title: Lattice Models for Phases and Transitions with Non-Invertible Symmetries
Authors: Lakshya Bhardwaj, Lea E. Bottini, Sakura Schafer-Nameki, Apoorv Tiwari
Abstract: Non-invertible categorical symmetries have emerged as a powerful tool to uncover new beyond-Landau phases of matter, both gapped and gapless, along with second order phase transitions between them. The general theory of such phases in (1+1)d has been studied using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT), also known as topological holography. This has unearthed the infrared (IR) structure of these phases and transitions. In this paper, we describe how the SymTFT information can be converted into an ultraviolet (UV) anyonic chain lattice model realizing, in the IR limit, these phases and transitions. In many cases, the Hilbert space of the anyonic chain is tensor product decomposable and the model can be realized as a quantum spin-chain Hamiltonian. We also describe operators acting on the lattice models that are charged under non-invertible symmetries and act as order parameters for the phases and transitions. In order to fully describe the action of non-invertible symmetries, it is crucial to understand the symmetry twisted sectors of the lattice models, which we describe in detail. Throughout the paper, we illustrate the general concepts using the symmetry category $\mathsf{Rep}(S_3)$ formed by representations of the permutation group $S_3$, but our procedure can be applied to any fusion category symmetry.

Title: Intrinsic spin Hall effect from spin quantum metric
Authors: Longjun Xiang, Hao Jin, Jian Wang
Abstract: The intrinsic spin Hall effect (ISHE), as proposed in [\href{this https URL} {Phys. Rev. Lett. \textbf{92}, 126603 (2004)}], stems from the spin Berry curvature. Herein, we propose the concept of \textit{spin quantum metric}, which is established as the quantum geometric counterpart of the spin Berry curvature within the \textit{spin quantum geometric tensor}, defined in a manner analogous to the conventional quantum geometric tensor. In contrast to the well-known $\mathcal{T}$-even ($\mathcal{T}$, time reversal) spin Berry curvature, the \textit{spin quantum metric} is a $\mathcal{T}$-odd tensor. Remarkably, by symmetry analysis we show that the $\mathcal{T}$-odd \textit{spin quantum metric} can also drive an ISHE particularly under a high-frequency electric field. We investigate this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE in the magnetically tilted surface Dirac cone and ferromagnetic monolayer MnBi$_2$Te$_4$. We find that this $\mathcal{T}$-odd ISHE dominates when the Fermi level is close to the band crossing or anticrossing point and can be as large as the $\mathcal{T}$-even ISHE when a THz or an infrared driving field is applied. Our work not only reveals an indispensable member in emergent quantum geometry physics but also offers a novel response function for ultrafast spintronics.

Title: Temperature-Dependent Optical Constants of Nanometer-thin Flakes of Fe(Te,Se) Superconductor in the Visible and Near-Infrared Regime
Authors: Aswini K. Pattanayak, Jagi Rout, Pankaj K. Jha
Abstract: Iron chalcogenides superconductors, such as Fe(Te,Se) have recently garnered significant attention due to their simple crystal structure with a relatively easy synthesis process, high-temperature superconductivity, intrinsic topological band structure, and an unconventional pairing of superconductivity with ferromagnetism. Here, we report the complex in-plane refractive index measurement of nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flake exfoliated from a single crystal FeTe$_{\text{0.6}}$Se$_{\text{0.4}}$ for photon wavelengths from 450 to 1100 nm over a temperature range from 4 K to 295 K. The results were obtained by employing a two-Drude model for the dielectric function of Fe(Te,Se), a multiband superconductor, and fitting the absolute optical reflection spectra using the transfer matrix method. A high extinction coefficient in the visible to near-infrared range makes nanometer-thin Fe(Te,Se) flakes a promising material for photodetection applications.

Title: Predicting quantum materials properties using novel faithful machine learning embeddings
Authors: Gavin Nop, Micah Mundy, Durga Paudyal, Jonathan Smith
Abstract: Machine Learning (ML) is accelerating the progress of materials prediction and classification, with particular success in CGNN designs. While classical ML methods remain accessible, advanced deep networks are still challenging to build and train. We introduce two new adaptations and refine two existing ML networks for generic crystalline quantum materials properties prediction and optimization. These new models achieve state-of-the-art performance in predicting TQC classification and strong performance in predicting band gaps, magnetic classifications, formation energies, and symmetry group. All networks easily generalize to all quantum crystalline materials property predictions. To support this, full implementations and automated methods for data handling and materials predictions are provided, facilitating the use of deep ML methods in quantum materials science. Finally, dataset error rates are analyzed using an ensemble model to identify and highlight highly atypical materials for further investigations.

Title: Ambipolar doping of a charge-transfer insulator in the Emery model
Authors: G. Sordi, G. L. Reaney, N. Kowalski, P. Sémon, A.-M. S. Tremblay
Abstract: Understanding the similarities and differences between adding or removing electrons from a charge-transfer insulator may provide insights about the origin of the electron-hole asymmetry found in cuprates. Here we study with cellular dynamical mean-field theory the Emery model set in the charge-transfer insulator regime, and dope it with either electrons or holes. We consider the normal state only and focus on the doping evolution of the orbital character of the dopants and on the nature of the doping driven transition. Regarding the orbital character of the dopants, we found an electron-hole asymmetry: doped electrons mostly enter the copper orbitals, whereas doped holes mostly enter the oxygen orbitals. Regarding the nature of the doping driven transition, we found no qualitative electron-hole asymmetry: upon either electron or hole doping, there is a two-stage transition from a charge-transfer insulator to a strongly correlated pseudogap and then to a metal. This shows that a strongly correlated pseudogap is an emergent feature of doped correlated insulators in two dimensions, in qualitative agreement with recent experiments on ambipolar Sr$_{1-x}$La$_{x}$CuO$_{2+y}$ cuprate films. Our results indicate that merely doping with holes or electrons a charge-transfer insulator is not sufficient for explaining the electron-hole asymmetry observed in the normal state phase diagram of cuprates. Our work reinforces the view that actual hole-doped cuprates are more correlated than their electron-doped counterparts.

Title: Current Correlations and Conductivity in SYK-Like Systems: An Analytical Study
Authors: Rishabh Jha, Stefan Kehrein, Jan C. Louw
Abstract: We present a functional-based approach to compute thermal expectation values for actions expressed in the $G-\Sigma$ formalism, applicable to any time sequence ordering. Utilizing this framework, we analyze the linear response to an electric field in various Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) chains. We consider the SYK chain where each dot is a complex $q/2$-body interacting SYK model, and we allow for $r/2$-body nearest-neighbor hopping where $r=\kappa q$. We find exact analytical expressions in the large-$q$ limit for conductivities across all temperatures at leading order in $1/q$ for three cases, namely $\kappa = \{ 1/2, 1, 2\}$. When $\kappa = \{1/2, 1\}$, we observe linear-in-temperature $T$ resistivities at low temperatures, indicative of strange metal behavior. Conversely, when $\kappa = 2$, the resistivity diverges as a power law at low temperatures, namely as $1/T^2$, resembling insulating behavior. As $T$ increases, there is a crossover to Fermi liquid behavior ($\sim T^2$) at the minimum resistivity. Beyond this, another crossover occurs to strange metal behavior ($\sim T$). In comparison to previous linear-in-$T$ results in the literature, we also show that the resistivity behavior exists even below the MIR bound, indicating a true strange metal instead of a bad metal. In particular, we find for the $\kappa = 2$ case a smooth crossover from an insulating phase to a Fermi liquid behavior to a true strange metal and eventually becoming a bad metal as temperature increases. We extend and generalize previously known results on resistivities to all temperatures, do a comparative analysis across the three models where we highlight the universal features and invoke scaling arguments to create a physical picture out of our analyses. Remarkably, we find a universal maximum DC conductivity across all three models when the hopping coupling strength becomes large.

Title: Failure of the Crystalline Equivalence Principle for Weak Free Fermions
Authors: Daniel Sheinbaum, Omar Antolín-Camarena
Abstract: Interacting crystalline SPT phases were first classified by Thorngren and Else through the crystalline equivalence principle, suggesting that a spatial group symmetry can be treated as if it were an internal symmetry group. Using techniques from topology we elucidate how this principle holds for one of the proposals for the interacting bosonic case and yet fails for weak free fermion phases. Last we show how a variant of the principle does hold for strong crystalline free fermion phases, showing that it is not necessary for the cohomology theory to be of Borel type.

Title: Types of dynamical behavior in a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice
Authors: Yu Zhang, Chenguang Liang, Shu Chen
Abstract: Quasiperiodic mosaic systems with the quasiperiodic potential being added periodically with a fixed lattice interval have attracted significant attention due to their peculiar spectral properties with exactly known mobility edges, which separate localized from delocalized states. These mobility edges do not vanish even in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength, although the width of the energy window of extended states decreases with the increase in potential strength and thus becomes very narrow in the limit of strong quasiperiodic disorder. In this paper, we study the dynamics of a quasiperiodic mosaic lattice and unravel its peculiar dynamical properties. By scrutinizing the expansion dynamics of wave packet and the evolution of density distribution, we unveil that the long-time density distribution displays obviously different behaviors at odd and even sites in the region of large quasiperiodic potential strength. Particularly, the timescale of dynamics exhibits an inverse relationship with the quasiperiodic potential strength. To understand these behaviors, we derive an effective Hamiltonian in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region, which is composed of decoupled Hamiltonians defined on the odd and even sites, respectively. While all eigenstates of the effective Hamiltonian defined on even sites are localized, the eigenstates of effective Hamiltonian defined on odd sites include both localized and extended eigenstates. Our results suggest that the effective Hamiltonian can describe the dynamical behaviors well in the large quasiperiodic potential strength region and provides an intuitive framework for understanding the peculiar dynamical behaviors in the quasiperiodic mosaic lattice.

Title: Mechanical hysterons with tunable interactions of general sign
Authors: Joseph D. Paulsen
Abstract: Hysterons are elementary units of hysteresis that underlie many complex behaviors of non-equilibrium matter. Because models of interacting hysterons can describe disordered matter, this suggests that artificial systems could respond to mechanical inputs in precise and targeted ways. Specifying the properties of hysterons and their interactions could thus be a general method for realizing arbitrary non-equilibrium behaviors. Elastic structures including slender beams, creased sheets, and shells are clear candidates for artificial hysterons, but complete control of their interactions has seemed impractical or impossible. Here we report a mechanical hysteron composed of rigid bars and linear springs, which has controllable properties and tunable interactions of general sign that can be reciprocal or non-reciprocal. We derive a mapping from the system parameters to the hysteron properties, and we show how collective behaviors of multiple hysterons can be targeted by adjusting geometric parameters on the fly. By transforming an abstract hysteron model into a physical design platform, our work demonstrates a route toward designed materials that can sense, compute, and respond to their mechanical environment.

Abstract: We use density functional methods to identify the atomic configurations of H and D atoms trapped by O impurities and embedded in bulk Nb. We calculate the double-well potential for O-H and O-D impurities, wave functions, and tunnel splittings for H and D atoms. Our results are in agreement with those obtained from analysis of heat capacity and neutron scattering measurements on Nb with low concentrations of O-H and O-D.

Title: Trade-off relations between quantum coherence and measure of many-body localization
Authors: Arti Garg, Arun Kumar Pati
Abstract: Quantum coherence, a fundamental resource in quantum computing and quantum information, often competes with localization effects that affects quantum states in disordered systems. In this work, we prove exact trade-off relations between quantum coherence and a measure of localization and many-body localization, namely, the inverse participation ratio (IPR). We prove that for a pure quantum state, $l_1$-norm of quantum coherence and the relative entropy of coherence satisfy complementarity relations with IPR. For a mixed state, IPR and the $l_2$-norm of quantum coherence as well as relative entropy of coherence satisfy trade-off inequalities. These relations suggest that quantum coherence, in disordered quantum systems is also an ideal characterization of the delocalisation to many-body localisation transition, much like IPR, which is a well-known diagnostic of MBL. These relations also provide insight into the unusual properties of bipartite entanglement entropy across the MBL transition. We believe that these trade-off relations can help in better understanding of how coherence can be preserved or lost in realistic many-body quantum systems, which is vital for developing robust quantum technologies and uncovering new phases of quantum matter.

Title: Two transitions in complex eigenvalue statistics: Hermiticity and integrability breaking
Authors: G. Akemann, F. Balducci, A. Chenu, P. Päßler, F. Roccati, R. Shir
Abstract: Open quantum systems have complex energy eigenvalues which are expected to follow non-Hermitian random matrix statistics when chaotic, or 2-dimensional (2d) Poisson statistics when integrable. We investigate the spectral properties of a many-body quantum spin chain, the Hermitian XXZ Heisenberg model with imaginary disorder. Its rich complex eigenvalue statistics is found to separately break both Hermiticity and integrability at different scales of the disorder strength. With no disorder, the system is integrable and Hermitian, with spectral statistics corresponding to the 1d Poisson point process. At very small disorder, we find a transition from 1d Poisson statistics to an effective $D$-dimensional Poisson point process, showing Hermiticity breaking. At intermediate disorder we find integrability breaking, as inferred from the statistics matching that of non-Hermitian complex symmetric random matrices in class AI$^†$. For large disorder, as the spins align, we recover the expected integrability (now in the non-Hermitian setup), indicated by 2d Poisson statistics. These conclusions are based on fitting the spin chain data of numerically generated nearest and next-to-nearest neighbour spacing distributions to an effective 2d Coulomb gas description at inverse temperature $\beta$. We confirm such an effective description of random matrices also applies in class AI$^†$ and AII$^†$ up to next-to-nearest neighbour spacings.

Title: Five-dimensional Floquet topological semimetals with emergent Yang monopoles and linked Weyl surfaces
Authors: Zheng-Rong Liu, Rui Chen, Bin Zhou
Abstract: Recently, Floquet topological matter has attracted significant attention for its potential to reveal novel topological phases inaccessible in static systems. In this paper, we investigate the effect of a time-periodic driving on the five-dimensional (5D) normal insulators. We show that the time-periodic driving can induce a topological phase transition from a \textbf{TP} (time reversal combined with space inversion) symmetry-preserving normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with emergent Yang monopoles characterized by the second Chern number. Additionally, we show that this time-periodic driving can also lead to a topological phase transition from a \textbf{TP} symmetry-breaking normal insulator to a 5D Floquet topological semimetal with a Hopf link formed by Weyl surfaces. Besides, further increasing the strength of the time-periodic driving, the two 5D Floquet topological semimetal phases are transformed into the 5D Floquet Chern insulators. Our paper is helpful for future studies in higher dimensional Floquet systems.

Title: Surface conduction and reduced electrical resistivity in ultrathin noncrystalline NbP semimetal
Authors: Asir Intisar Khan, Akash Ramdas, Emily Lindgren, Hyun-Mi Kim, Byoungjun Won, Xiangjin Wu, Krishna Saraswat, Ching-Tzu Chen, Yuri Suzuki, Felipe H. da Jornada, Il-Kwon Oh, Eric Pop
Abstract: The electrical resistivity of conventional metals, such as copper, is known to increase in thin films due to electron-surface scattering, limiting the performance of metals in nanoscale electronics. Here, we find an unusual reduction of resistivity with decreasing film thickness in niobium phosphide (NbP) semimetal deposited at relatively low temperatures of 400 °C. In films thinner than 5 nm, the room temperature resistivity (~34 microohm*cm for 1.5-nm-thick NbP) was up to six times lower than the bulk NbP resistivity, and lower than conventional metals at similar thickness (typically ~100 microohm*cm). Remarkably, the NbP films are not crystalline, but display local nanocrystalline, short-range order within an amorphous matrix. Our analysis suggests that the lower effective resistivity is due to conduction via surface channels, together with high surface carrier density and sufficiently good mobility as the film thickness is reduced. These results and the fundamental insights obtained here could enable ultrathin, low-resistivity wires for nanoelectronics, beyond the limitations of conventional metals.

Title: On the material genome of wurtzite ferroelectrics
Authors: Zijian Zhou, Kan-Hao Xue, Jinhai Huang, Heng Yu, Shengxin Yang, Shujuan Liu, Yiqun Wang, Xiangshui Miao
Abstract: As the dielectric film thickness shrinks to ~10 nm, some traditional wurtzite piezoelectric materials demonstrate ferroelectricity through element doping. Among them, Sc doped AlN and Mg doped ZnO are the most famous examples. While it is widely acknowledged that the dopant atoms effectively reduce the coercive field, enabling ferroelectric polarization switching, the material genome of these wurtzite (WZ) ferroelectrics is still less understood. In this work, we analyze the features of WZ ferroelectrics, ascribing them to five-coordination (5C) ferroelectrics, which may be compared with 6C ferroelectrics (perovskite-type) and 7C ferroelectrics (hafnia-like). In particular, the exact reason for their adopting the hexagonal WZ structure instead of the zinc blende structure is studied. Emphasis is paid to the degree of ionicity in promoting the hexagonal arrangement, and the phenomenon of layer distance compression is discovered and explained in WZ ferroelectrics. The role of element doping in coercive field reduction is understood within this context.

Title: Identifying Independent Components and Internal Process Order Parameters in Nonequilibrium Multicomponent Nonstoichiometric Compounds
Authors: Yanzhou Ji, Yueze Tan, Long-Qing Chen
Abstract: In CALPHAD-type thermodynamic databases, nonstoichiometric compounds are typically described by sublattice models where the sublattice site fractions represent the occupation probability of different atomic, ionic or defect species on different sublattices. Here, we develop a general procedure and corresponding linear algebra tools for converting the sublattice site fractions to a combination of independent component compositions and internal process order parameters describing the extent of internal atomic exchange, electronic redox and defect generation reactions. We apply them to a number of nonstoichiometric phases in thermodynamic databases and literature. The general procedure can be applied to constructing thermodynamic databases in terms of internal process order parameters for nonstoichiometric phases in multicomponent systems such as high-entropy oxides and alloys, which can be utilized to model their kinetics of nonequilibrium processes and microstructure evolution.

Title: Spin-$S$ Ising Models with Multi-Spin Interactions on the One-Dimensional Chain and Two-Dimensional Square Lattice
Authors: Kohei Suzuki
Abstract: We study spin-$S$ Ising models with $p$-spin interactions on the one-dimensional chain and the two-dimensional square lattice. Here, $S$ denotes the magnitude of the spin and $p$ represents the number of spins involved in each interaction. The analysis is performed for $S=1/2,1,3/2,2$ and $p=3,4,5$. For the one-dimensional model, we formulate transfer matrices, and numerically diagonalize them to analyze the temperature dependence of the free energy and spin-spin correlations. In the case of $S=1/2$, the free energy does not depend on $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are uniformly enhanced across all temperature scales as $p$ increases. In contrast, for $S \geq 1$, the free energy varies with $p$, and the spin-spin correlations are significantly enhanced at lower temperatures as $p$ increases. For the two-dimensional model, by using multicanonical simulations, we analyze physical quantities such as an order parameter, internal energy, and specific heat. In addition, we define and examine an order parameter to distinguish ordered and disordered phases. It is found that a first-order phase transition occurs at finite temperatures for all $S$ and $p\geq3$, and increasing $p$ strengthens its nature. We present $S$ and $p$ dependence of the transition temperature and latent heat, and discuss effects of higher-order interactions on the nature of phase transitions.

Title: Instability and particle current control of a parametrically driven Bose-Einstein condensate in a ring-shaped lattice
Authors: L. Q. Lai
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics of a Bose-Einstein condensate in a one-dimensional ring-shaped lattice with the Peierls phase and site-dependent modulations, where the condensate is confined in a single deep trap and the interparticle interaction strength is modulated by a time-periodic driving field. The system has a finite spectrum, which limits the excitation regimes, and the Peierls phase typically induces imbalanced complex hopping amplitudes in each direction, leading to nonzero net particle currents along the lattice chain, which can hold nearly persistent even when the driving field is turned off after half of the period. The configuration provides a specific way for the coherent control of particle currents in many-body quantum systems with the help of an external driving field, and promotes the possible applications in future closed-loop atom circuits.

Title: Enhancing creep resistance in refractory high-entropy alloys: role of grain size and local chemical order
Authors: Saifuddin Zafar, Mashaekh Tausif Ehsan, Sourav Das Suvro, Mahmudul Islam, Mohammad Nasim Hasan
Abstract: Refractory high-entropy alloys (RHEAs) are a promising class of materials with potential applications in extreme environments, where the dominant failure mode is thermal creep. The design of these alloys, therefore, requires an understanding of how their microstructure and local chemical distribution affect creep behavior. In this study, we performed high-fidelity atomistic simulations using machine-learning interatomic potentials to explore the creep deformation of MoNbTaW RHEAs under a wide range of stress and temperature conditions. We parametrized grain size and local chemical order (LCO) to investigate the effects of these two important design variables, which are controllable during the alloy fabrication process. Our investigation revealed that resistance to creep deformation is enhanced by larger grain sizes and higher levels of LCO. This study highlights the importance of utilizing LCO in conjunction with other microstructural properties when designing RHEAs for extreme environment applications.

Title: Spin and Density Modes in a Binary Fluid of Light
Authors: Clara Piekarski, Nicolas Cherroret, Tangui Aladjidi, Quentin Glorieux
Abstract: We present the experimental observation of spin and density modes in a binary mixture of superfluids of light. A miscible Bose-Bose mixture with repulsive interactions is obtained by propagating, in the paraxial limit, the two circular polarization components of a laser through a non-linear hot atomic vapor. Controlling the intensity and phase for both polarizations allows us to selectively excite the fundamental modes of the mixture. Using a Bragg-like spectroscopy technique, we measure the dispersion relation and identify two distinct branches with different speeds of sound corresponding to the spin and density modes. At large photon density, we observe a crossing of these branches, which is due to an effective photon-photon interaction beyond the two-body regime and related to the saturation of the medium nonlinearity. This novel degree of freedom allows for precise control over the ratio of spin and density sound velocities and provide new insights into the control of binary mixtures collective dynamics.

Title: Proliferation and prohibition of self-loops in ensembles of interacting binary elements
Authors: Paul Baconnier, Margot H. Teunisse, Martin van Hecke
Abstract: Models based on spins or hysterons with appropriately chosen interactions can capture advanced memory effects in complex materials, such as transients in repeatedly compressed crumpled sheets or sequential computing in driven metamaterials. However, unphysical self-loops dominate the response when interactions are chosen randomly, undermining statistical approaches. Here, we uncover the origin of self-loop proliferation in randomly coupled models. We introduce the weakly asymmetric ensemble to suppress self-loops and then develop interaction ensembles to strictly eliminate these. Finally, we use these ensembles to explore the statistics of large systems. Our work highlights the subtle role of interaction symmetries and paves the way for statistical studies of the sequential response and memory effects in complex, multistable materials.

Title: Emergence of a Landau level structure in dark optical lattices
Authors: Sylvain Nascimbene, Jean Dalibard
Abstract: An optical flux lattice is a set of light beams that couple different internal states of an atom, thereby producing topological energy bands. Here we present a configuration in which the atoms exhibit a dark state, i.e. an internal state that is not coupled to the light. At large light intensity, the low-energy dynamics is restricted to the dark state, leading to an effective continuum model with a Landau-level-like structure. This structure is dramatically different from that of usual topological optical lattices, which lead to discrete models in the tight-binding limit. The proposed system is essentially immune to heating due to photon scattering, making it a highly promising way to emulate the integer or fractional quantum Hall effect.

Title: Quantum Interference Driven Electron Transport through Fano-Anderson Systems
Authors: Koushik R. Das, Sudipta Dutta
Abstract: We investigate the electronic transport behavior of Fano-Anderson (FA) systems, consisting of a one-dimensional finite backbone chain and an attached side-group of varying length. The tight-binding model within the non-equilibrium Green's function (NEGF) reveals distinct interference patterns between the frontier orbitals of odd and even side-group systems that lead to distinct transport mechanisms across various configurations. The even side-group systems exhibit resonant tunneling peaks, while the odd ones demonstrate significant destructive interference at Fermi energy leading to antiresonance and reduced current responses. Further exploration of the role of electron-electron interactions within mean-field Hubbard Hamiltonian indicates the emergence of negative differential resistance (NDR) in odd side-group systems at lower biases, a phenomenon absent in the non-interacting case. Our study demonstrates the critical role of quantum interferences among the frontier molecular orbitals and electron correlations in shaping the transport behavior of FA systems, providing insights for the design of molecular-scale electronic devices.

Authors: Sushant Kumar Behera, Ruggero Sala, Abhirup Roy Karmakar, Matteo Moioli, Rocco Martinazzo, Matteo Cococcioni
Abstract: The Chirality-Induced Spin Selectivity (CISS) effect describes the ability of chiral molecules and crystals to transmit spin-polarized currents, a phenomenon first identified in 1999. Although this effect holds great promise for a broad spectrum of different applications in device physics and synthetic chemistry (including, e.g., spintronics, quantum computing, spin- and enantio-selective chemistry), its underlying mechanisms remain incompletely understood. The prevailing hypothesis attributes the CISS effect to enhanced spin-orbit coupling (SOC) within chiral molecules. However, the SOC magnitude required to align with experimental observations significantly exceeds the values derived from conventional atomic-scale calculations, particularly for systems composed of light atoms. In this work, we leverage the implementation of \texttt{fully relativistic density functional theory (DFT)} equations, as available in the \texttt{Dirac code}, to investigate how molecular chirality manifests itself in the chirality density of electronic states. We further explore how this responds to an applied external electric field. To assess spin-dependent transport, we employ the \texttt{Landauer-Imry-Büttiker} formalism, examining the dependence of spin transmission on the twist angle of the molecular structure that defines its geometrical chirality. While our findings qualitatively align with experimental trends, they point to the necessity of a more general treatment of SOC, \textit{e.g.}, including geometrical terms or through the dependence of advanced exchange-correlation functionals on the electronic spin-current density.

Title: Quantum many-body dynamics for fermionic t-J model simulated with atom arrays
Authors: Ye-bing Zhang, Xin-Chi Zhou, Bao-Zong Wang, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The fermionic t-J model has been widely recognized as a canonical model in understanding various strongly correlated phases like cuprate high-Tc superconductivity. Simulating this model with controllable quantum platforms offers new possibilities to probe high-Tc physics, yet suffering challenges. Here we propose a novel scheme to realize the t-J model in a programmable Rydberg-dressed tweezer array. By properly engineering the Rydberg-dressed dipole-dipole interaction and inter-tweezer couplings, a highly tunable fermionic t-J model with next-nearest-neighbour hopping terms is achieved. We particularly explore quantum many-body dynamics in the large J/t limit, a regime far beyond the conventional optical lattices and cuprates. Notably, we predict a nontrivial self-pinning effect enforced by local quantum entanglement that characterizes a novel type of Hilbert space fragmentation. This effect leads to the breakdown of Krylov restricted thermalization. Our prediction opens a new horizon in exploring exotic quantum many-body dynamics with t-J model in tweezer arrays, and shall also make a step towards simulating the high-Tc physics in cold atom systems.

Title: On Computational Complexity of 3D Ising Spin Glass: Lessons from D-Wave Annealer
Authors: Hao Zhang, Alex Kamenev
Abstract: Finding an exact ground state of a 3D Ising spin glass is proven to be an NP-hard problem. Given validity of the exponential time hypothesis, its computational complexity was proven to be no less than $2^{N^{2/3}}$, where $N$ is the total number of spins. Here we report results of extensive experimentation with D-Wave 3D annealer with $N\leq 5627$. We found exact ground states (in a probabilistic sense) for typical realizations of 3D spin glasses with the efficiency, which scales as $2^{N/\beta}$ with $\beta\approx 10^{3}$. Based on statistical analysis of low energy states, we argue that with an improvement of annealing protocols and device noise reduction, $\beta$ can be increased even further. This suggests that, for $N<\beta^3$, annealing devices provide a most efficient way to find the ground state.

Title: Dynamical electron-phonon vertex correction
Authors: Andrea Marini
Abstract: The dynamical screening of the electron-phonon vertex is due to the retarded oscillations of the electronic charge following the phonon annihilation into an electron-hole pair. This retardation induces a frequency dependence of the electron-phonon interaction that is commonly neglected. In this work I propose a dynamical perturbative expansion that, while being diagrammatically consistent, defines a controllable and physically sound method to include dynamical screening effects in the electron-phonon vertex. The method is applied to the phonon self-energy of the homogeneous electron gas where I show how retardation effects are driven by the ratio between the plasma and the phonon frequencies. I finally propose a simple approach to estimate the importance of dynamical corrections. This method is applied to the paradigmatic case of MgB$_2$ to show the non--perturbative and large retardation effects that characterize this peculiar material.

Title: Magnetoelectric effect in van der Waals magnets
Authors: Kai-Xuan Zhang, Giung Park, Youjin Lee, Beom Hyun Kim, Je-Geun Park
Abstract: The magnetoelectric (ME) effect is a fundamental concept in modern condensed matter physics and represents the electrical control of magnetic polarisations or vice versa. Two-dimensional (2D) van-der-Waals (vdW) magnets have emerged as a new class of materials and exhibit novel ME effects with diverse manifestations. This review emphasizes some important recent discoveries unique to vdW magnets: multiferroicity on two dimensions, spin-charge correlation, atomic ME effect and current-induced intrinsic spin-orbit torque, and electrical gating control and magnetic control of their electronic properties. We also highlight the promising route of utilizing quantum magnetic hetero- or homo-structures to engineer the ME effect and corresponding spintronic and optoelectronic device applications. Due to the intrinsic two-dimensionality, vdW magnets with those ME effects are expected to form a new, exciting research direction.

Title: Investigation of magnetic ordering with spin reorientation transition and optical properties in DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ nanomaterials
Authors: M. M. Islam, M. A. Islam, Rana Hossain, M. J. Hosen, M. D. I. Bhuyan
Abstract: This study reports the synthesis and physical properties of polycrystalline DyCo$_{0.5}$Cr$_{0.5}$O$_3$ (DCCO) nanoparticles. Analysis of the powder X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern using Rietveld refinement showed that the compound crystallizes in an orthorhombic crystal structure with a space group Pbnm. The particle size of approximately 57 nm was confirmed through micrographs obtained from field emission scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. The X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) investigations identified a mixed-valence state of Co and Cr cations. Magnetic susceptibility data indicated Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature range 140-340 K and the onset of antiferromagnetic interactions with a Neel temperature of 119 K. At 31 K, DCCO shows spin reorientation transition from $\Gamma_4$(G$_x$A$_y$F$_z$) to $\Gamma_2$(F$_x$C$_y$G$_z$). Furthermore, room-temperature magnetization measurements demonstrated the antiferromagnetic behavior with weak ferromagnetic interactions at low temperatures. Additionally, DCCO exhibited semiconducting behavior with a direct optical bandgap of 1.97 eV, indicating promise for visible-light-driven energy harvesting and catalytic applications.

Title: Anomalous Magnetotransport in the Paramagnetic State of a Magnetic Kagome Metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$
Authors: Yun Shu, Xinrun Mi, Yuhao Wei, Sixue Tao, Aifeng Wang, Yisheng Chai, Dashuai Ma, Xiaolong Yang, Mingquan He
Abstract: We investigate the electrical transport properties of a magnetic kagome metal EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$, which undergoes magnetic ordering below $T_\mathrm{c}=10.5$ K. Unlike typical magnets showing anomalous magnetotransport in their ordered states, EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ exhibits unusual magnetotransport behaviors in its paramagnetic phase. Specifically, the magnetoconductivity shows a linear dependence on magnetic field at low fields below $\sim 1$ T, and the Hall conductivity undergoes a sign change below about 2 T. These behaviors resemble those observed in the charge density wave (CDW) phase of kagome metals $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ ($A$ = K, Rb, Cs). The anomalous magnetotransport in $A$V$_3$Sb$_5$ has commonly been attributed to the possible emergence of a time-reversal symmetry breaking chiral CDW order. However, given the absence of CDW in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ and its manifestation exclusively in the paramagnetic state, the anomalous magnetotransport observed in EuTi$_3$Bi$_4$ is likely associated with multiband transport and/or the van Hove singularities near the Fermi level.

Title: All-microwave Lamb shift engineering for a fixed frequency multi-level superconducting qubit
Authors: Byoung-moo Ann, Gary A. Steele
Abstract: It is known that the electromagnetic vacuum is responsible for the Lamb shift, which is a crucial phenomenon in quantum electrodynamics (QED). In circuit QED, the readout or bus resonators that are dispersively coupled can result in a significant Lamb shift of the qubit. However, previous approaches or proposals for controlling the Lamb shift in circuit QED demand overheads in circuit designs or non-perturbative renormalization of the system's eigenbases, which can impose formidable this http URL this work, we propose and demonstrate an all-microwave method for controlling the Lamb shift of fixed-frequency transmons. We employ the drive-induced longitudinal coupling between the transmon and resonator. By simply using an off-resonant monochromatic drive near the resonator frequency, we can control the net Lamb shift up to 30 MHz and engineer it to zero with the drive-induced longitudinal coupling without facing the aforementioned challenges. Our work establishes an efficient way of engineering the fundamental effects of the electromagnetic vacuum and provides greater flexibility in non-parametric frequency controls of multilevel systems.

Title: Violation of Ferromagnetic Ordering of Energy Levels in Spin Rings for the Singlet
Authors: David Heson, Shannon Starr, Jacob Thornton
Abstract: We demonstrate a violation of the ``ferromagnetic ordering of energy levels'' conjecture (FOEL) for even length spin rings. The FOEL conjecture was a guess made by Nachtergaele, Spitzer and an author for the Heisenberg model on certain graphs: a family of inequalities, the first of which is the statement that the spectral gap of the Heisenberg model equals the gap of the random walk. That first guess was originally a conjecture of Aldous which was later proved by Caputo, Liggett and Richthammer. We claim that for spin rings of even length $L>4$, the lowest spin $S=0$ energy is lower than the lowest spin $S=1$ energy. This violates the $(L/2)$-th inequality in the FOEL conjecture. Our methodology is largely numerical: we have applied exact diagonalization up to $L=20$. We also rigorously consider the Hamiltonian of the Heisenberg spin ring for even length $L$ projected to the spin $S=0$ sector. We prove that it has a unique ground state. Then, using the single mode approximation the uniqueness explains the energy turn-around. Important insight comes from reconsideration of previous work by Sutherland, using the Bethe ansatz. Especially important is a work of Dhar and Shastry that goes beyond the Bethe ansatz.

Caldwell, P. Alonso-González, A. Paarmann
Abstract: The vast repository of van der Waals (vdW) materials supporting polaritons offers numerous possibilities to tailor electromagnetic waves at the nanoscale. The development of twistoptics - the modulation of the optical properties by twisting stacks of vdW materials - enables directional propagation of phonon polaritons (PhPs) along a single spatial direction, known as canalization. Here we demonstrate a complementary type of directional propagation of polaritons by reporting the visualization of unidirectional ray polaritons (URPs). They arise naturally in twisted hyperbolic stacks with very different thicknesses of their constituents, demonstrated for homostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and heterostructures of $\alpha$-MoO$_3$ and $\beta$-Ga$_2$O$_3$. Importantly, their ray-like propagation, characterized by large momenta and constant phase, is tunable by both the twist angle and the illumination frequency. Apart from their fundamental importance, our findings introduce twisted asymmetric stacks as efficient platforms for nanoscale directional polariton propagation, opening the door for applications in nanoimaging, (bio)-sensing or polaritonic thermal management.

Title: Thermodynamic pressure and mechanical pressure for electromagnetic media
Authors: Q. H. Liu
Abstract: By the mechanical pressure we mean that the pressure in the fundamental thermodynamic equation with the naive form of the electromagnetic work used, while the thermodynamic one we mean that in the equation with proper thermodynamic form of the electromagnetic work instead. Both pressures differ from a magnetic mutual field pressure which results from the electromagnetic stress tensor for the linear and uniform media in static electromagnetic field. Both pressures are in essence tensors, but a quasi-scalar theory is sufficient for the simple media.

Abstract: Coherent Diffraction Imaging (CDI) is an experimental technique to gain images of isolated structures by recording the light scattered off the sample. In principle, the sample density can be recovered from the scattered light field through a straightforward Fourier Transform operation. However, only the amplitude of the field is recorded, while the phase is lost during the measurement process and has to be retrieved by means of suitable, well-established, phase retrieval algorithms. In this work we present SPRING, an analysis framework tailored on X-ray Free Electron Laser (XFEL) diffraction data that implements the Memetic Phase Retrieval method to mitigate the shortcomings of conventional algorithms. We benchmark the approach on experimental data acquired in two experimental campaigns at SwissFEL and European XFEL. Imaging results on isolated nanostructures reveal unprecedented stability and resilience of the algorithm's behavior on the input parameters, as well as the capability of identifying the solution in conditions hardly treatable so far with conventional methods. A user-friendly implementation of SPRING is released as open-source software, aiming at being a reference tool for the coherent diffraction imaging community at XFEL and synchrotron facilities.

Title: Dataset-Free Weight-Initialization on Restricted Boltzmann Machine
Authors: Muneki Yasuda, Ryosuke Maeno, Chako Takahashi
Abstract: In feed-forward neural networks, dataset-free weight-initialization methods such as LeCun, Xavier (or Glorot), and He initializations have been developed. These methods randomly determine the initial values of weight parameters based on specific distributions (e.g., Gaussian or uniform distributions) without using training datasets. To the best of the authors' knowledge, such a dataset-free weight-initialization method is yet to be developed for restricted Boltzmann machines (RBMs), which are probabilistic neural networks consisting of two layers. In this study, we derive a dataset-free weight-initialization method for Bernoulli--Bernoulli RBMs based on statistical mechanical analysis. In the proposed weight-initialization method, the weight parameters are drawn from a Gaussian distribution with zero mean. The standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is optimized based on our hypothesis that a standard deviation providing a larger layer correlation (LC) between the two layers improves the learning efficiency. The expression of the LC is derived based on a statistical mechanical analysis. The optimal value of the standard deviation corresponds to the maximum point of the LC. The proposed weight-initialization method is identical to Xavier initialization in a specific case (i.e., when the sizes of the two layers are the same, the random variables of the layers are $\{-1,1\}$-binary, and all bias parameters are zero). The validity of the proposed weight-initialization method is demonstrated in numerical experiments using a toy and real-world datasets.

Title: Mid-Infrared Frequency Combs and Pulse Generation based on Single Section Interband Cascade Lasers

Abstract: Interband Cascade Lasers (ICLs) are semiconductor lasers emitting in the mid-wave infrared (MWIR 3-6 {\mu}m) and can operate as frequency combs (FCs). These demonstrations are based on double section cavities that can reduce dispersion and/or are adapted for radio-frequency operation. Here we show that ICLs FCs at long wavelengths, where the refractive index dispersion reduces, can be realized in a single long section cavity. We show FC generation for ICLs operating at {\lambda} ~ 4.2 {\mu}m, demonstrating narrow electrical beatnotes over a large current range. We also reconstruct the ultrafast temporal response through a modified SWIFT spectroscopy setup with two fast MWIR detectors, which shows a frequency modulated response in free-running operation. Further, we show that, through active modelocking, the ICL can be forced to generate short pulses on the order of 3 ps. This temporal response is in agreement with Maxwell Bloch simulations, highlighting that these devices possess long dynamics (~100ps) and potentially makes them appropriate for the generation of large peak powers in the MWIR.

Title: Damage and recovery of flagella in soil bacteria exposed to shear within long microchannels
Authors: Juan Pablo Carrillo-Mora, Moniellen Pires Monteiro, Aníbal R. Lodeiro, V. I. Marconi, María Luisa Cordero
Abstract: The swimming motility of bacteria is driven by the action of bacterial flagellar motors, whose outermost structure is a long and thin helicoidal filament. When rotated, the fluid medium exerts an anisotropic viscous drag on the flagellar filaments, ultimately leading to bacterial propulsion. The flagellar filaments are protein-based flexible structures that can break due to interactions with fluid flows. Here, we study the evolution of flagellar filaments in the soil bacterium $\textit{Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens}$ after being exposed to shear flows created in long microchannels, for shear rates between $1$ s$^{-1}$ and $10^5$ s$^{-1}$, and for durations between tens of milliseconds and minutes. We demonstrate that the average swimming speed and fraction of swimming cells decrease after exposition to shear, but both parameters can recover, at least partially, with time. These observations support the hypothesis that shear flows cut flagellar filaments but that reversibly damaged bacterial flagellar motors can be restored thanks to filament regeneration. By fitting our observations with phenomenological expressions, we obtain the individual growth rates of the two different flagellar filaments that $\textit{B. diazoefficiens}$ possesses, showing that the lateral filaments have a recovery time of about 40 min while the subpolar one requires more than 4.5 h to regrow. Our work demonstrates that simple monitoring of bacterial motility after exposition to shear can be used to characterize the process of flagellar filament breakup and growth, a phenomenon widely present in bacteria swimming in porous soil and exposed to shear flows due to rainfall and watering systems.

Title: Two-dimensional Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators in monolayer Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family
Authors: Jinghui Wei, Qikun Tian, XinTing Xu, Guangzhao Qin, Xu Zuo, Zhenzhen Qin
Abstract: The Rashba effect in Janus structures, accompanied by nontrivial topology, plays an important role in spintronics and even photovoltaic applications. However, less effort has been devoted to searching for the Rashba effect and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators, from the perspective of material design and establishing universal rules. Herein, through first-principles calculations, we systematically investigate the geometric stability and electronic structures of 135 kinds of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family derived from two-dimensional MA2Z4 (M=Mg, Ga, Sr; A=Al, Ga; Z=S, Se, Te) monolayers, and design numerous Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators. As the atomic number rises, the bandgaps of Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) decrease continuously from 2.14 eV for MgAl2S3Se. The trend persists until the bandgap, when combined with strong spin-orbit coupling, shrinks to cause band inversion and reopen with nontrivial topology. Especially in specific Janus systems, pz orbitals near the Fermi level, in conjunction with band inversion, could create a hybrid spin texture with double Rashba splitting. Notably, the Rashba effect, nontrivial topological states and unique spin textures can be significantly tuned synchronously through small biaxial strain. Our work not only expands the diverse Janus MAA'ZxZ'(4-x) family with multifunctional application prospects but also reveals the designing rules of Rashba semiconductors and inversion-asymmetric topological insulators.

Title: Machine-learning identified nitride quantum wells for enhanced red emission
Authors: Nick Pant, Rob Armitage, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: III-nitride heterostructures are critical for achieving polychromatic micron-scale pixels in extended-reality and biomedical applications, however red emission remains challenging. Here, we address this challenge by systematically exploring their design space with machine learning. We surprisingly uncover that larger polarization fields globally correlate with higher wave-function overlaps for red emission. The key is the quantum-confined Stark effect, which enables a reduction in well width while avoiding the associated increase in In composition. We outline strategies for engineering polarization fields through the tuning of composition, strain, and interlayer and quantum-barrier thicknesses. Without polarization fields, efficient red emission would not be possible in nitride LEDs given the current challenges in nitride epitaxy. Our results show how polarization can improve light emission from polar semiconductor heterostructures.

Title: Thermodynamics of coupled time crystals with an application to energy storage
Authors: Paulo J. Paulino, Albert Cabot, Gabriele De Chiara, Mauro Antezza, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: Open many-body quantum systems can exhibit intriguing nonequilibrium phases of matter, such as time crystals. In these phases, the state of the system spontaneously breaks the time-translation symmetry of the dynamical generator, which typically manifests through persistent oscillations of an order parameter. A paradigmatic model displaying such a symmetry breaking is the boundary time crystal, which has been extensively analyzed experimentally and theoretically. Despite the broad interest in these nonequilibrium phases, their thermodynamics and their fluctuating behavior remain largely unexplored, in particular for the case of coupled time crystals. In this work, we consider two interacting boundary time crystals and derive a consistent interpretation of their thermodynamic behavior. We fully characterize their average dynamics and the behavior of their quantum fluctuations, which allows us to demonstrate the presence of quantum and classical correlations in both the stationary and the time-crystal phases displayed by the system. We furthermore exploit our theoretical derivation to explore possible applications of time crystals as quantum batteries, demonstrating their ability to efficiently store energy.

Title: Strong and weak symmetries and their spontaneous symmetry breaking in mixed states emerging from the quantum Ising model under multiple decoherence
Authors: Takahiro Orito, Yoshihito Kuno, Ikuo Ichinose
Abstract: Discovering and categorizing quantum orders in mixed many-body systems are currently one of the most important problems. Specific types of decoherence applied to typical quantum many-body states can induce a novel kind of mixed state accompanying characteristic symmetry orders, which has no counterparts in pure many-body states. We study phenomena generated by interplay between two types of decoherence applied to the one-dimensional transverse field Ising model (TFIM). We show that in the doubled Hilbert space formalism, the decoherence can be described by filtering operation applied to matrix product states (MPS) defined in the doubled Hilbert system. The filtering operation induces specific deformation of the MPS, which approximates the ground state of a certain parent Hamiltonian in the doubled Hilbert space. In the present case, such a parent Hamiltonian is the quantum Ashkin-Teller model, having a rich phase diagram with a critical lines and quantum phase transitions. By investigating the deformed MPS, we find various types of mixed states emergent from the ground states of the TFIM, and clarify phase transitions between them. In that study, strong and weak $Z_2$ symmetries play an important role, for which we introduce efficient order parameters, such as Rényi-2 correlators, entanglement entropy, etc., in the doubled Hilbert space.

Title: Refining Coarse-Grained Molecular Topologies: A Bayesian Optimization Approach
Authors: Pranoy Ray, Adam P. Generale, Nikhith Vankireddy, Yuichiro Asoma, Masataka Nakauchi, Haein Lee, Katsuhisa Yoshida, Yoshishige Okuno, Surya R. Kalidindi
Abstract: Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are essential for accurately predicting the physical and chemical properties of large molecular systems across various pressure and temperature ensembles. However, the high computational costs associated with All-Atom (AA) MD simulations have led to the development of Coarse-Grained Molecular Dynamics (CGMD), providing a lower-dimensional compression of the AA structure into representative CG beads, offering reduced computational expense at the cost of predictive accuracy. Existing CGMD methods, such as CG-Martini (calibrated against experimental data), aim to generate an embedding of a topology that sufficiently generalizes across a range of structures. Detrimentally, in attempting to specify parameterization with applicability across molecular classes, it is unable to specialize to domain-specific applications, where sufficient accuracy and computational speed are critical. This work presents a novel approach to optimize derived results from CGMD simulations by refining the general-purpose Martini3 topologies for domain-specific applications using Bayesian Optimization methodologies. We have developed and validated a CG potential applicable to any degree of polymerization, representing a significant advancement in the field. Our optimized CG potential, based on the Martini3 framework, aims to achieve accuracy comparable to AAMD while maintaining the computational efficiency of CGMD. This approach bridges the gap between efficiency and accuracy in multiscale molecular simulations, potentially enabling more rapid and cost-effective molecular discovery across various scientific and technological domains.
