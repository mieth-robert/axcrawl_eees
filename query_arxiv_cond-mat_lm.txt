Title: Anderson transition in high dimension: comments to arXiv:2403.01974
Authors: I. M. Suslov (<a href="http://P.L.Kapitza" rel="external noopener nofollow" class="link-external link-http">this http URL</a> Institute for Physical Problems, Moscow, Russia)
Abstract: In the recent submission arXiv:2403.01974, Altshuler et al suggested a new approach to the Anderson transition in high dimensions. The main idea consists in the use of the branching graphs instead of high-dimensional lattices: it does not look very convincing, but we do not want to stress this point. Since the authors welcome comments, we put forward a lot of objections to their exposition of the general situation. The arising hypothesis is given in the end.

Title: Localized Triplons and Site Stuffing in the Quantum Dimer Magnet BiYbGeO$_5$
Authors: Rachit Kapoor, D. Yahne, V.O. Garlea, G. Hester
Abstract: Thermodynamic and muon spin-relaxation measurements have recently highlighted BiYbGeO$_5$ as a new example of a rare-earth-based quantum dimer magnet with isolated Yb$^{3+}$ spin-$\frac{1}{2}$ dimers. However, direct spectroscopic evidence of the triplet excitations and measurements of the structural disorder are lacking. In this work, polycrystalline BiYbGeO$_5$ was synthesized using conventional high-temperature solid-state methods and investigated via high-resolution neutron powder diffraction and inelastic neutron scattering. Diffraction measurements down to 58 mK reveal no signatures of magnetic order and indicate that nearly 20\% of Yb$^{3+}$ sites are replaced by non-magnetic Bi$^{3+}$, introducing significant structural disorder. Inelastic neutron scattering shows dispersionless triplon excitations, consistent with localized, non-interacting spin dimers. Fits to the triplet excitation spectrum identify an XXZ-type anisotropic exchange with $J_{XX}$ = 0.11(2) meV and $J_Z = 0.15(1)$ meV. These findings establish BiYbGeO$_5$ as a structurally disordered but magnetically well-isolated quantum dimer system, providing a model platform for studying the resilience of entangled spin states to site dilution.

Title: Markovian dissipation can stabilize a (localization) quantum phase transition
Authors: Naushad A. Kamar, Mostafa Ali, Mohammad Maghrebi
Abstract: Quantum phase transitions are a cornerstone of many-body physics at low temperatures but have remained elusive far from equilibrium. Driven open quantum systems -- a prominent non-equilibrium platform where coherent dynamics competes with Markovian dissipation from the environment -- often exhibit an effective classical behavior. In this work, we present a nontrivial quantum phase transition that is stabilized, rather than destroyed, by Markovian dissipation. We consider a variant of the paradigmatic spin-boson model where the spin is driven and bosons are subject to Markovian loss proportional to frequency (hence, vanishing at low frequencies). We show that the steady state exhibits a localization phase transition where the spin's dynamics is frozen, to be contrasted with the ground-state transition in the absence of dissipation. Furthermore, this transition occurs when the steady state becomes pure. The latter is not simply a dark state of dissipation but rather emerges from a nontrivial renormalization of the spin dynamics by low-frequency bosonic modes. Our work provides a nontrivial example where quantumness, typically reserved for ground states, also emerges in dynamical settings, with potential applications in quantum computation.

Title: Quantum multicriticality and emergent symmetry in Dirac systems with two order parameters at three-loop order
Authors: Max Uetrecht, Igor F. Herbut, Michael M. Scherer, Emmanuel Stamou, Tom Steudtner
Abstract: Two-dimensional materials with interacting Dirac excitations can host quantum multicritical behavior near the phase boundaries of the semimetallic and two-ordered phases. We study such behavior in Gross--Neveu--Yukawa field theories where $N_f$ flavors of Dirac fermions are coupled to two order-parameter fields with $SO(N_A)$ and $SO(N_B)$ symmetry, respectively. To that end, we employ the perturbative renormalization group up to three-loop order in $4-\epsilon$ spacetime dimensions. We distinguish two key scenarios: (i) The two orders are compatible as characterized by anticommuting mass terms, and (ii) the orders are incompatible. For the first case, we explore the stability of a quantum multicritical point with emergent $SO(N_A\!+\!N_B)$ symmetry. We find that the stability is controlled by increasing the number of Dirac fermion flavors. Moreover, we extract the series expansion of the leading critical exponents for the chiral $SO(4)$ and $SO(5)$ models up to third order in $\epsilon$. Notably, we find a tendency towards rapidly growing expansion coefficients at higher orders, rendering an extrapolation to $\epsilon=1$ difficult. For the second scenario, we study a model with $SO(4) \simeq SO(3) \times SO(3)$ symmetry, which was recently suggested to describe criticality of antiferromagnetism and superconductivity in Dirac systems. However, it was also argued that a physically admissible renormalization-group fixed point only exists for $N_f$ above a critical number $N_{c}^>$. We determine the corresponding series expansion at three-loop order as $N_{c}^>\approx 16.83-7.14\epsilon-7.12\epsilon^2$. This suggests that the physical choice of $N_f=2$ may be a borderline case, where true criticality and pseudocriticality, as induced by fixed-point annihilation, are extremely challenging to distinguish.

Title: Kekulé order from diffuse nesting near higher-order Van Hove points
Authors: Jonas Beck, Jonathan Bodky, Matteo Dürrnagel, Ronny Thomale, Julian Ingham, Lennart Klebl, Hendrik Hohmann
Abstract: Translation symmetry-breaking order is assumed to be suppressed by the lack of Fermi surface nesting near certain higher-order Van Hove singularities (HOVHS). We show the anisotropic band-flattening inherent to such HOVHS, combined with broadening of the Fermi surface due to elevated critical temperatures, results in the Fermi surface becoming approximately nested at a wavevector unrelated to the precise shape of the Fermi surface - leading to a $\sqrt{3}\times\sqrt{3}$ Kekulé density wave formation. The effect is demonstrated using unbiased renormalization group calculations for a model of the breathing kagome lattice. Our mechanism - termed diffuse nesting - represents an entirely new notion in the study of Fermi surface instabilities.

Title: Frictional Contact Network in Dense Suspension Flow
Authors: Shweta Sharma, Abhishek Sharma, Abhinendra Singh
Abstract: Dense particulate suspensions often exhibit a dramatic increase in viscosity in response to external deformation. This shear thickening behavior has been related to a transition from lubricated, unconstrained pairwise motion to a frictional contact network (FCN) at high stresses. Here, we study the characteristics of the FCN formed during shear thickening to investigate the role of constraints, emphasizing the impact of resistance to gear-like rolling. We contrast the FCN formed by sliding friction alone with that formed by particles with sliding and rolling constraints. Particles with sliding constraints only form a highly interconnected network with primary force chains in the compressive direction, which requires orthogonal support from other force chains. However, orthogonal support is not required for mechanical stability when particles have both sliding and rolling constraints. In addition, the force chains appear linear and longer, reducing the jamming volume fraction for rough/faceted particles. Finally, we propose a novel mechanical stability picture for rough/faceted particles with sliding and rolling constraints, which is crucial for understanding the flow behavior of real-life suspensions.

Title: Ultra-long-living magnons in the quantum limit

Abstract: Coherence time is the property of a quantum system that determines how long a state can hold quantum information. This parameter is directly bound to their lifetime in solid-state systems, where quantum information could be stored in quasiparticles. For decades, quasiparticles associated with magnetization order disturbance - magnons, had reported lifetimes below one microsecond at gigahertz frequencies, restricting their use as a quantum information carrier. Here, we report on the observation of short-wavelength magnons with lifetimes exceeding 18{\mu}s at millikelvin temperatures. The experiment has been performed in an ultra-pure single-crystal Yttrium Iron Garnet sphere in a wide range of temperatures from ambient down to 30 mK. Our results open doors for using magnons as data carriers in modern solid-state quantum computing platforms.

Title: Molecular anyons in fractional quantum Hall effect
Authors: Mytraya Gattu, J. K. Jain
Abstract: One of the profound consequences of the fractional quantum Hall (FQH) effect is the notion of fractionally charged anyons. In spite of extensive experimental study, puzzles remain, however. For example, both shot-noise and Aharonov-Bohm interference measurements sometimes report a charge that is a multiple of the elementary charge. We report here high-precision microscopic calculations that reveal the surprising result that the FQH anyons often bind together into stable clusters, which we term molecular anyons. This is counterintuitive, given that the elementary anyons carry the same charge and are therefore expected to repel one another. The number of anyons in a cluster, its binding energy and its size depend sensitively on the parent FQH state and the interaction between electrons (which is experimentally tunable, e.g., by varying the quantum well width). Our calculations further suggest that the charge-$1/4$ non-Abelian anyons of the $5/2$ FQH state may also bind to form charge-$1/2$ Abelian clusters. The existence of molecular anyons not only can provide a natural explanation for the observed charges, but also leads to a host of new predictions for future experiments and invites a re-analysis of many past ones.

Title: PdNeuRAM: Forming-Free, Multi-Bit Pd/HfO2 ReRAM for Energy-Efficient Computing
Authors: Erbing Hua, Theofilos Spyrou, Majid Ahmadi, Abdul Momin Syed, Hanzhi Xun, Laurentiu Braic, Ewout van der Veer, Nazek Elatab, Anteneh Gebregiorgis, Georgi Gaydadjiev, Beatriz Noheda, Said Hamdioui, Ryoichi Ishihara, Heba Abunahla
Abstract: Memristor technology shows great promise for energy-efficient computing, yet it grapples with challenges like resistance drift and inherent variability. For filamentary Resistive RAM (ReRAM), one of the most investigated types of memristive devices, the expensive electroforming step required to create conductive pathways results in increased power and area overheads and reduced endurance. In this study, we present novel HfO2-based forming-free ReRAM devices, PdNeuRAM, that operate at low voltages, support multi-bit functionality, and display reduced variability. Through a deep understanding and comprehensive material characterization, we discover the key process that allows this unique behavior: a Pd-O-Hf configuration that capitalizes on Pd innate affinity for integrating into HfO2. This structure actively facilitates charge redistribution at room temperature, effectively eliminating the need for electroforming. Moreover, the fabricated ReRAM device provides tunable resistance states for dense memory and reduces programming and reading energy by 43% and 73%, respectively, using spiking neural networks (SNN). This study reveals novel mechanistic insights and delineates a strategic roadmap for the realization of power-efficient and cost-effective ReRAM devices.

Title: Symmetry tuning topological states of an axion insulator with noncollinear magnetic order

Abstract: Topological properties of quantum materials are intimately related to symmetry. Here, we tune the magnetic order of the axion insulator candidate EuIn$_2$As$_2$ from its broken-helix ground state to the field-polarized phase by applying an in-plane magnetic field. Using results from neutron diffraction and magnetization measurements with ab inito theory and symmetry analysis, we determine how the field tunes the magnetic symmetry within individual magnetic domains and examine the resulting changes to the topological surface states and hinge states existing on edges shared by certain surfaces hosting gapped Dirac states. We predict field-tunable complex and domain-specific hinge-state patterns, with some crystal surfaces undergoing a field-induced topological phase transition. We further find that domain walls have pinned hinge states when intersecting certain crystal surfaces, providing another channel for tuning the chiral-charge-transport pathways.

Title: Selenization of V2O5/WO3 Bilayers for Tuned Optoelectronic Response of WSe2 Films
Authors: Abhishek Bajgain, Santu Prasad Jana, Alexander Samokhvalov, Thomas Parker, John Derek Demaree, Ramesh C. Budhani
Abstract: Scalable and controlled doping of two-dimensional transition metal dichalcogenides is essential for tuning their electronic and optoelectronic properties. In this work, we demonstrate a robust approach for substitution of vanadium in tungsten diselenide (WSe$_2$) via the selenization of pre-deposited V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ thin films. By adjusting the thickness of the vanadium oxide layer, the V concentration in W$_{1-x}$V$_x$Se$_2$ is systematically varied. Electrical measurements on field-effect transistors reveal a substantial enhancement in hole conduction, with drain current increasing by nearly three orders of magnitude compared to undoped WSe$_2$. Temperature-dependent electrical resistivity indicates a clear insulator-to-metal transition with increasing V content, likely due to band structure modifications. Concurrently, the photoconductive gain decreases, suggesting enhanced recombination and charge screening effects. These results establish vanadium doping via selenization of V$_2$O$_5$/WO$_3$ films as a scalable strategy for modulating the transport and photoresponse of WSe$_2$, offering promising implications for wafer-scale optoelectronic device integration.

Title: Enhanced Stability and Linearly Polarized Emission from CsPbI3 Perovskite Nanoplatelets through A-site Cation Engineering
Authors: Woo Hyeon Jeong, Junzhi Ye, Jongbeom Kim, Rui Xu, Xinyu Shen, Chia-Yu Chang, Eilidh L. Quinn, Myoung Hoon Song, Peter Nellist, Henry J. Snaith, Yunwei Zhang, Bo Ram Lee, Robert L. Z. Hoye
Abstract: The anisotropy of perovskite nanoplatelets (PeNPLs) opens up many opportunities in optoelectronics, including enabling the emission of linearly polarized light. But the limited stability of PeNPLs is a pressing challenge, especially for red-emitting CsPbI3. Herein, we address this limitation by alloying FA into the perovskite cuboctahedral site. Unlike Cs/FA alloying in bulk thin films or nonconfined nanocubes, FA incorporation in nanoplatelets requires meticulous control over the reaction conditions, given that nanoplatelets are obtained in kinetically-driven growth regimes instead of thermodynamically-driven conditions. Through in-situ photoluminescence (PL) measurements, we find that excess FA leads to uncontrolled growth, where phase-impurities and nanoplatelets of multiple thicknesses co-exist. Restricting the FA content to up to 25% Cs substitution enables monodisperse PeNPLs, and increases the PL quantum yield (from 53% to 61%), exciton lifetime (from 18 ns to 27 ns), and stability in ambient air (from ~2 days to >7 days) compared to CsPbI3. This arises due to hydrogen bonding between FA and the oleate and oleylammonium ligands, anchoring them to the surface to improve optoelectronic properties and stability. The reduction in non-radiative recombination, improvement in the nanoplatelet aspect ratio, and higher ligand density lead to FA-containing PeNPLs more effectively forming edge-up superlattices, enhancing the PL degree of linear polarization from 5.1% (CsPbI3) to 9.4% (Cs0.75FA0.25PbI3). These fundamental insights show how the stability limitations of PeNPLs could be addressed, and these materials grown more precisely to improve their performance as polarized light emitters, critical for utilizing them in next-generation display, bioimaging and communications applications.

Title: Nanoscale quantum imaging of field-free deterministic switching of a chiral antiferromagnet
Authors: Jingcheng Zhou, Senlei Li, Chuangtang Wang, Hanshang Jin, Stelo Xu, Zelong Xiong, Carson Jacobsen, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Valentin Taufour, Liuyan Zhao, Hua Chen, Chunhui Rita Du, Hailong Wang
Abstract: Recently, unconventional spin-orbit torques (SOTs) with tunable spin generation open new pathways for designing novel magnetization control for cutting-edge spintronics innovations. A leading research thrust is to develop field-free deterministic magnetization switching for implementing scalable and energy favorable magnetic recording and storage applications, which have been demonstrated in conventional ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic material systems. Here we extend this advanced magnetization control strategy to chiral antiferromagnet Mn3Sn using spin currents with out-of-plane canted polarization generated from low-symmetry van der Waals (vdW) material WTe2. Numerical calculations suggest that damping-like SOT of spins injected perpendicular to the kagome plane of Mn3Sn serves as a driving force to rotate the chiral magnetic order, while the field-like SOT of spin currents with polarization parallel to the kagome plane provides the bipolar deterministicity to the magnetic switching. We further introduce scanning quantum microscopy to visualize nanoscale evolutions of Mn3Sn magnetic domains during the field-free switching process, corroborating the exceptionally large magnetic switching ratio up to 90%. Our results highlight the opportunities provided by hybrid SOT material platforms consisting of noncollinear antiferromagnets and low-symmetry vdW spin source materials for developing next-generation, transformative spintronic logic devices.

Title: Emergence of Transverse Dielectric Response in Ferroelectric Dielectric Heterostructures
Authors: Fernando Gómez-Ortiz, Ramamoorthy Ramesh, Javier Junquera
Abstract: We report the emergence of a transverse dielectric response in PbTiO$_{3}$/SrTiO$_{3}$ superlattices hosting polar vortex structures. Using second-principles simulations, we find that an electric field applied along one direction induces significant local polarization responses along orthogonal directions, with magnitudes approaching half that of the diagonal susceptibility components. These off-diagonal responses are strongly dependent on the topology of the vortex structure and can be deterministically tuned or even reversed via homogeneous electric fields or epitaxial strain. Notably, the transverse susceptibilities become comparable to the diagonal components during a field- or strain-induced transition to a polarization wave state. This discovery opens avenues for engineering reconfigurable nanoscale dielectric responses in topologically textured ferroelectric systems.

Title: Spectrum Selective Interfaces and Materials towards Non-photothermal Saltwater Evaporation: Demonstration with a White Ceramic Wick
Authors: Navindra D. Singh, James Leung, Ji Feng, Alma K. González-Alcalde, Arial Tolentino, David Tuft, Juchen Guo, Luat T. Vuong
Abstract: Most solar desalination efforts are photothermal: they evaporate water with ``black'' materials that absorb as much sunlight as possible. Such ``brine-boiling'' methods are severely limited by the high thermal mass of water, i.e., its capacity to store and release heat. Here, we study the light-enhanced evaporation by a hard, white, aluminum nitride wick, which reveals a route to selectively target salt-water bonds instead of bulk heating. Evaporation rates dramatically increase with short-wavelength illumination. Violet-light illumination achieves 4-10x higher evaporation enhancement compared to orange and IR light. Our results identify a light-driven, spectrum-selective path to non-photothermal saltwater evaporation and opportunities to employ ceramic wicks for salt harvesting. Such low-cost, low-energy desalination systems would reduce the heat island effects of traditional solar technologies and contribute to new cooling technologies where drought is also a concern.

Title: Telecom quantum dots on GaAs substrates as integration-ready high performance single-photon sources
Authors: Beatrice Costa, Bianca Scaparra, Xiao Wei, Hubert Riedl, Gregor Koblmüller, Eugenio Zallo, Jonathan Finley, Lukas Hanschke, Kai Müller
Abstract: The development of deterministic single photon sources emitting in the telecommunication bands is a key challenge for quantum communication and photonic quantum computing. Here, we investigate the optical properties and single-photon emission of molecular beam epitaxy grown semiconductor quantum dots emitting in the telecom O- and C- bands. The quantum dots are embedded in a InGaAs matrix with fixed indium content grown on top of a compositionally graded InGaAs buffer. This structure allows for the future implementation of electrically contacted nanocavities to enable high-quality and bright QD emission. In detailed optical characterizations we observe linewidths as low as $ 50 \mu$eV, close to the spectrometer resolution limit, low fine structure splittings close to $ 10 \mu$eV, and $g^{(2)} (0)$ values as low as $0.08$. These results advance the current performance metrics for MBE-grown quantum dots on GaAs substrates emitting in the telecom bands and showcase the potential of the presented heterostructures for further integration into photonic devices.

Title: Understanding and Embracing Imperfection in Physical Learning Networks
Authors: Sam Dillavou, Marcelo Guzman, Andrea J. Liu, Douglas J. Durian
Abstract: Performing machine learning (ML) with analog instead of digital signals offers advantages in speed and energy efficiency, but component and measurement imperfections can make nonlinear analog networks difficult to train. As a result, most schemes involve a precise digital model, either to train alone or in tandem with experiments. Here we take a different perspective: working in the analog domain, we characterize the consequences of the inherent imperfection of a physical learning system and, ultimately, overcome them. We train an analog network of self-adjusting resistors -- a contrastive local learning network (CLLN) -- for multiple tasks, and observe limit cycles and characteristic scaling behaviors absent in `perfect' systems. We develop an analytical model that captures these phenomena by incorporating an uncontrolled but deterministic bias into the learning process. Our results suggest that imperfections limit precision and erase memory of previous tasks by continuously modifying the underlying representation of all learned tasks, akin to representational drift in the brain. Finally, we introduce and demonstrate a system-agnostic training method that greatly suppresses these effects. Our work points to a new, scalable approach in analog learning, one that eschews precise modeling and instead thrives in the mess of real systems.

Title: Spontaneous vortex lattice due to orbital magnetization in valley polarized superconductors
Authors: Ammar Jahin, Shi-Zeng Lin
Abstract: In this work, we study the spontaneous formation of a vortex lattice in two-dimensional valley polarized superconductors due to orbital magnetization. The screening of magnetic field is weak for two-dimension superconductors, allowing for the magnetic flux associated with vortices to penetrate deep into the superconducting region. The Zeeman coupling between orbital magnetization and magnetic fields associated with vortices leads to the formation of a vortex lattice, once the vortex self-energy is lower than the Zeeman energy. We study the phase diagram and the vortex lattice configuration, and discuss the consequences of the vortex lattice formation in various experimental setups.

Title: Emergent universal long-range structure in random-organizing systems
Authors: Satyam Anand, Guanming Zhang, Stefano Martiniani
Abstract: Self-organization through noisy interactions is ubiquitous across physics, mathematics, and machine learning, yet how long-range structure emerges from local noisy dynamics remains poorly understood. Here, we investigate three paradigmatic random-organizing particle systems drawn from distinct domains: models from soft matter physics (random organization, biased random organization) and machine learning (stochastic gradient descent), each characterized by distinct sources of noise. We discover universal long-range behavior across all systems, namely the suppression of long-range density fluctuations, governed solely by the noise correlation between particles. Furthermore, we establish a connection between the emergence of long-range order and the tendency of stochastic gradient descent to favor flat minima -- a phenomenon widely observed in machine learning. To rationalize these findings, we develop a fluctuating hydrodynamic theory that quantitatively captures all observations. Our study resolves long-standing questions about the microscopic origin of noise-induced hyperuniformity, uncovers striking parallels between stochastic gradient descent dynamics on particle system energy landscapes and neural network loss landscapes, and should have wide-ranging applications -- from the self-assembly of hyperuniform materials to ecological population dynamics and the design of generalizable learning algorithms.

Title: Non Markovian electron Brownian motion with radiation reaction force
Authors: Juan Francisco García-Camacho, Oliver Contreras-Vergara, Norma Sánchez-Salas, Gonzalo Ares de Parga, José Inés Jiménez-Aquino
Abstract: In this work, we study non-Markovian electronic plasma diffusion from a classical point of view, taking into account the effects of the radiation reaction force. The electron Brownian motion is described by a Generalized Langevin Equation (GLE) characterized by an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck-type friction memory kernel. To take into account the effects of the radiation reaction force, an effective memory time which accounts for the thermal interaction of the Brownian particle with its surroundings is proposed. This effective memory time is defined as tauef equal tau minus tau0 less than 0, where the memory time tau accounts for the collision time between electrons in a Brownian motion-like manner, and tau0 is due to the interaction with the radiation reaction force. Under these conditions, the GLE can be transformed into a stochastic Abraham-Lorentz-like equation, which is analytically solved without violation of causality. The theoretical results will be compared with the numerical simulation.

Title: Diverse edge states of nanoribbons and excitonic insulator states of the monolayer Ta2Ni3Te5
Authors: Hong Tang, Jiang Wei, Gabor I. Csonka, Adrienn Ruzsinszky
Abstract: Ta2Ni3Te5, a layered transition metal chalcogenide with quasi-one-dimensional electronic states, exhibits rich topological and correlated phenomena. Using first-principles calculations, we explore Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons, demonstrating tunable electronic and magnetic properties-ranging from metallic to semimetallic and semiconducting (band gaps of 29.7-60.8 meV), and from ferromagnetic to antiferromagnetic-controlled by edge (Ni or Ta), ribbon width, and H/F saturation. Additionally, GW and Bethe-Salpeter equation (BSE) calculations, complemented by metaGGA-based modified BSE, reveal that the Ta2Ni3Te5 monolayer is an excitonic insulator, with an exciton binding energy exceeding its band gap. These diverse properties position Ta2Ni3Te5 nanoribbons and monolayers as promising candidates for nanoelectronics, spintronics, and optoelectronics, motivating further experimental exploration.

Title: Probing disorder-induced Fisher information matrix and Cramér-Rao bound by STM
Authors: Lucas A. Oliveira, Wei Chen
Abstract: The electronic local density of states of solids, if normalized correctly, represents the probability density that the electron at a specific position has a particular energy. Because this probability density can vary in space in disordered systems, we propose that one can either treat the energy as a random variable and position as an external parameter to construct a real space Fisher information matrix, or treat the position as a random variable and energy as an external parameter to construct an energy space Fisher information, both quantify the variation of local density of states caused by the disorder. The corresponding Cramér-Rao bounds in these two scenarios set a limit on the energy variance and the position variance of electrons, respectively, pointing to new interpretations of STM measurements. Our formalism thus bring the notion of information geometry into STM measurements, as demonstrated explicitly by lattice models of metals and topological insulators.

Title: Parametric Instability in Discrete Models of Spatiotemporally Modulated Materials
Authors: Jiuda Wu, Behrooz Yousefzadeh
Abstract: We investigate the phenomenon of parametric instability in discrete models of spatiotemporally modulated materials. These materials are celebrated in part because they exhibit nonreciprocal transmission characteristics. However, parametric instability may occur for strong modulations, or occasionally even at very small modulation amplitudes, and prevent the safe operation of spatiotemporally modulated devices due to an exponential growth in the response amplitude. We use Floquet theory to conduct a detailed computational investigation of parametric instability. We explore the roles of modulation parameters (frequency, amplitude, wavenumber), the number of modulated units, and damping on the stability of the system. We highlight the pivotal role of spatial modulation in parametric instability, a feature that is predominantly overlooked in this context. We use the perturbation method to obtain analytical expressions for modulation frequencies at which the response becomes unstable. We hope that our findings enable and inspire new applications of spatiotemporally modulated materials that operate at higher amplitudes.

Title: Machine Learning Framework for Characterizing Processing-Structure Relationship in Block Copolymer Thin Films
Authors: Bradley Lamb, Saroj Upreti, Yunfei Wang, Daniel Struble, Chenhui Zhu, Guillaume Freychet, Xiaodan Gu, Boran Ma
Abstract: The morphology of block copolymers (BCPs) critically influences material properties and applications. This work introduces a machine learning (ML)-enabled, high-throughput framework for analyzing grazing incidence small-angle X-ray scattering (GISAXS) data and atomic force microscopy (AFM) images to characterize BCP thin film morphology. A convolutional neural network was trained to classify AFM images by morphology type, achieving 97% testing accuracy. Classified images were then analyzed to extract 2D grain size measurements from the samples in a high-throughput manner. ML models were developed to predict morphological features based on processing parameters such as solvent ratio, additive type, and additive ratio. GISAXS-based properties were predicted with strong performances ($R^2$ > 0.75), while AFM-based property predictions were less accurate ($R^2$ < 0.60), likely due to the localized nature of AFM measurements compared to the bulk information captured by GISAXS. Beyond model performance, interpretability was addressed using Shapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP). SHAP analysis revealed that the additive ratio had the largest impact on morphological predictions, where additive provides the BCP chains with increased volume to rearrange into thermodynamically favorable morphologies. This interpretability helps validate model predictions and offers insight into parameter importance. Altogether, the presented framework combining high-throughput characterization and interpretable ML offers an approach to exploring and optimizing BCP thin film morphology across a broad processing landscape.

Title: Burgers rings as topological signatures of Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses
Authors: Arabinda Bera, Ido Regev, Alessio Zaccone, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Eshelby-like quadrupolar structures serve as the fundamental microscopic units for characterizing plastic instabilities in amorphous solids and play a crucial role in explaining their mechanical failure, including the formation of shear bands. However, identifying Eshelby-like plastic events in glasses remains challenging due to their inherent structural and dynamical complexity. In this work, we show that Eshelby-like structures can be precisely identified and localized using a topological invariant known as the continuous Burgers vector. By combining analytical and simulation techniques, we reveal the emergence of a topological Burgers ring around Eshelby plastic events, enabling the precise identification of their center of mass and capturing their orientation as well. This proposed method offers a clear and unambiguous framework to locate and characterize the plastic rearrangements that govern plasticity in glasses.

Title: Theory of chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect
Authors: Naoki Nishimura, Takumi Funato, Mamoru Matsuo, Takeo Kato
Abstract: We theoretically explore the generation of spin current driven by a temperature gradient in a junction between a chiral insulator and a normal metal. Based on the gyromagnetic effect caused by microscopic rotation due to phonons, we derive a formula for a spin current when a finite temperature difference is imposed at two ends of the sample. We clarify how the spin current depends on the sample geometry, the thermal conductivity, the heat conductance at the interface, and the average temperature. Our formulation provides a microscopic foundation for the chiral-phonon-activated spin Seebeck effect without relying on magnetism and spin-orbit interactions.

Title: Thermodynamic Constraints in DRAM cells: Experimental Verification of Energy Efficiency Limits in Information Erasure
Authors: Takase Shimizu, Kensaku Chida, Gento Yamahata, Katsuhiko Nishiguchi
Abstract: We measured the energy efficiency of information erasure using silicon DRAM cells capable of counting charges on capacitors at the single-electron level. Our measurements revealed that the efficiency decreased as the erasure error rate decreased, and notably, the Landauer limit was not achieved even under effectively infinite-time operation. By comparing the measured efficiency with the Landauer limit, we identified a thermodynamic constraint that prevents DRAM from reaching this limit: the inability to prepare the initial state in thermal equilibrium, which in turn prohibits quasi-static operations. This finding has broad implications for DRAM cells and for many electronic circuits sharing similar structures. Furthermore, it validates our experimental approach to discovering thermodynamic constraints that impose tighter, practically relevant limits, opening a new research direction in information thermodynamics.

Title: Multiple-Nanowire Superconducting Quantum Interference Devices: Critical Currents, Symmetries, and Vorticity Stability Regions
Authors: Cliff Sun, Alexey Bezryadin
Abstract: An ordinary superconducting quantum interference device (SQUID) contains two weak links connected in parallel. We model a multiple-wire SQUID (MW-SQUID), generalized in two ways. First, the number of weak links, which are provided by parallel superconducting nanowires, is larger than two. Second, the current-phase relationship of each nanowire is assumed linear, which is typical for a homogeneous superconducting thin wire. For such MW-SQUIDs, our model predicts that the critical current ($I_c$) is a multi-valued function of the magnetic field. We also calculate vorticity stability regions (VSR), i.e., regions in the current-magnetic field plane in which, for a given distribution of vortices, the currents in all wires are below their critical values, so the vortices do not move between the cells. The VSRs have rhombic shapes in the case of two-wire SQUIDS and have more complicated shapes in the case of many nanowires. We present a classification of such VSRs and determine conditions under which VSR is disjoint, leading to 100\% supercurrent modulation and quantum phase transitions. According to the model, the maximum critical current curves obey $IB$ symmetry, while each VSR obeys $IBV$ symmetry. The model predicts conditions at which MW-SQUID exhibits a perfect diode effect in which the critical current of one polarity is zero while it is not zero for the opposite polarity of the bias current. We also provide a classification of the stability regions produced by (1) completely symmetric, (2) phase disordered, (3) position disordered, (4) critical current disordered, and (5) completely disordered multi-wire SQUIDs.

Title: Integrated phononic waveguide on thin-film lithium niobate on diamond
Authors: Sultan Malik, Felix M. Mayor, Wentao Jiang, Hyunseok Oh, Carl Padgett, Viraj Dharod, Jayameenakshi Venkatraman, Ania C. Bleszynski Jayich, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini
Abstract: We demonstrate wavelength-scale phononic waveguides formed by transfer-printed thin-film lithium niobate (LN) on bulk diamond (LNOD), a material stack that combines the strong piezoelectricity of LN with the high acoustic velocity and color-center compatibility of diamond. We characterize a delay line based on a 100 micron long phononic waveguide at room and cryogenic temperatures. The total insertion loss through the device at 4 kelvin is -5.8 dB, corresponding to a >50% transducer efficiency, at a frequency of 2.8 gigahertz. Our work represents a step towards phonon-mediated hybrid quantum systems consisting of strain-sensitive color centers in diamond.

Title: Breakdown of the quantum anomalous Hall effect under microwave drives
Authors: Torsten Röper, Daniel Rosenbach, Achim Rosch, Alexey A. Taskin, Yoichi Ando, Erwann Bocquillon
Abstract: Quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) insulators exhibit chiral dissipationless edge states without an external magnetic field, making them a promising material for quantum metrology and microwave applications. However, the breakdown of the zero-resistance state at low currents hinders progress. We investigate and characterize this breakdown under microwave fields (1-25 GHz) by measuring the increase of longitudinal resistance in RF Hall bars and RF Corbino devices made from V-doped (Bi,Sb)$_2$Te$_3$ films. Our results point to the role of heating of electron-hole puddles under microwave irradiation, thereby fostering hopping transport. Our work offers insights critical for GHz-range QAH applications.

Title: Magnetostrictive Phononic Frequency Combs
Authors: Guanqi Ye, Ruitong Sun, Junning Zhao, Fusheng Ma
Abstract: Magnetostriction, mechanical-to-magnetic or magnetic-to-mechanical response, plays a pivotal role in magneto-mechanical systems. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate a magneto-mechanical frequency comb via the three-wave mixing mechanism, which solely requires the involvement of the fundamental mode f0 of a magnetostrictive macroresonator. Two types of combs, i.e., the integer-harmonic combs and the half-integer-harmonic combs, are observed in kHz regime with Hz resolution by magnetically pumping the mm-scale resonator with near-resonant f0. The integer-harmonic combs are centered at lfp, while the half-integer-harmonic combs are centered at (2n - 1) fp/2 resulting from the period-doubling bifurcation of fp. The tooth spacing of both types of combs is determined and can be continuously tuned by changing fs from Hz to kHz. Moreover, the half-integer-harmonic combs can be purposely switched with frequency shifting half a tooth spacing via suppressing period-doubling bifurcation. The experimentally observed formation, evolution, and switching of combs can be well understood by introducing the bias magnetical force and modulated linear stiffness into the Duffing equation. Our findings on magnetically manipulated phononic frequency comb could provide a magneto-mechanical platform for potential non-invasive and contactless sensing and even antenna for wireless operation.

Title: Magnonic chaotic comb
Authors: Ruitong Sun, Guanqi Ye, Fusheng Ma
Abstract: Optical chaotic comb, possessing the key metrics of intrinsic random amplitude, phase, and frequency modulation of comb lines, emerges as a novel chaotic source in information systems for coherence tomography, parallel ranging, and secure communications. Considering the analogies between magnons and photons, the magnonic analog of optical chaotic combs is expected but not yet explored. Here, we propose a scenario of generating magnonic chaotic combs based on mode coupling mechanism in magnonic systems. Especially, we theoretically demonstrate the realization of magnonic frequency combs through three-wave mixing between ultra-strongly coupled magnons in silicon based synthetic antiferromagnet platform. It is found that the realized magnonic frequency combs can transition to chaos via various routes, i.e., subcritical Hopf bifurcation, torus-doubling bifurcation, and torus breakdown. The robustness of magnonic chaotic combs is verified by characterizing the Poincare map, the bifurcation diagrams, and the largest Lyapunov exponents. Furthermore, the unique characters of chaotic combs, perturbation hypersensitivity and noise immunity, are conceptually validated by identifying latent magnetic signal contaminated by inherent noise. Our findings provide a magnonic paradigm of chaotic dynamics in complex systems for potential applications in CMOS-integrated metrology, sensing, and communication.

Title: V. J. Emery and P. W. Anderson's views and related issues regarding the basics of cuprates: a re-look
Authors: Navinder Singh
Abstract: In 1991, V. J. Emery in his important review article entitled "Some aspects of the theory of high temperature superconductors"\cite{emery1} argued against the Zhang-Rice reduction of three-band to an effective one-band model. In his words "...therefore it seems that the simple $t-J$ model does not account for the properties of high temperature superconductors". Over approximately 35 years after the initial debates\cite{debates} much has happened in the field pertaining to this topic. Even though it is one of the most discussed issue, a comprehensive account and the required resolution are lacking. Connected to the debate over one-band versus three-band models is another discussion: the one-component versus two-component model for cuprates. The two-component model is most strongly advocated by Barzykin and Pines\cite{bp}. In this article the author attempts a perspective and a re-look on some of these issues. After an analysis of a large body of literature, author finds that V. J. Emery's criticism of the Zhang-Rice reduction was correct. Many central experimental features of cuprates cannot be rationalized within the one-band model, and Johnston-Nakano scaling is one such example. Other examples are also discussed. Author introduces a simple-minded toy model to illustrate the core issues involved.

Title: Emergent Quasiparticles \& Field-Tuned RIXS Spectra in a Trimerized Spin-1/2 Chain
Authors: Subhajyoti Pal, Pradeep Thakur, Ashis Kumar Nandy, Anamitra Mukherjee
Abstract: We investigate spin-flip excitations in the spin-1/2 trimer chain $\rm{Cu_3(P_2O_6OH)_2}$, featuring an antiferromagnetic exchange motif $J_1$-$J_1$-$J_2$ with $J_1 < J_2$. Using density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) simulations, we demonstrate that single-spin-flip processes induced by resonant inelastic X-ray scattering (RIXS) generate emergent gapless modes governed by the underlying trimer periodicity alongside distinct high-energy excitations. By combining exact diagonalization and real-space renormalization group (RG) techniques, we attribute these features to fractionalized spinons and composite quasiparticles arising from one- and two-trimer excitations. Furthermore, we show that multi-spin RIXS excitations yield experimentally distinguishable spectral signatures of composite modes absent in single-spin-flip spectra. At the field-induced 1/3 magnetization plateau, single-spin-flip RIXS spectra evolves with the magnetic field to favor spin-polarized composite quasiparticles. This trend culminates in a gapless spectrum of spin-1 excitations beyond the plateau, paving the way for field-tuned Bose condensation of composite modes.

Title: Polymer-modulated evaporation flow enables scalable self-assembly of highly aligned nanowires
Authors: Liyiming Tao, Zechao Jiang, Shiyuan Hu, Lin Du, Qiuting Zhang, Jiajia Zhou, Masao Doi, Xiaojun Wu, Xingkun Man, Ye Xu
Abstract: Highly aligned nanowire networks are essential for enabling anisotropic optical, electrical, and sensing functionalities in next-generation devices. However, achieving such alignment typically requires complex fabrication methods or high-energy processing. Here, we present a simple and scalable self-assembly strategy that uses a viscosity-enhancing polymer additive to modulate fluid flows during solvent evaporation. The addition of carboxymethylcellulose sodium (CMC-Na) reshapes the evaporation-driven flow field and generates a compressional flow region near the drying edge. Within this region, rotation-inducing velocity gradients progressively align silver nanowires (AgNWs) into highly ordered arrays. This unique mechanism yields uniform AgNW coatings with a high degree of nanowire alignment and tunable areal density across centimeter-scale areas. The resulting films exhibit strong broadband anisotropy, including polarization-dependent transmission in both visible and terahertz (THz) regimes and angle-dependent electrical conductivity. The approach also integrates naturally with dip-coating-based shear alignment, enabling programmable control over alignment direction and spatial patterning. This work establishes a robust, polymer-enabled mechanism for bottom-up nanowire alignment and offers a passive, energy-efficient route for fabricating anisotropic nanostructured coatings.

Title: Optical Controllable Spin-Polarization in Two Dimensional Altermagnets via Robust Spin-Momentum Locking Excitons
Authors: Jiuyu Sun, Jinzhe Han, Yongping Du, Erjun Kan
Abstract: Spin-momentum locking (SML) excitons in two-dimensional semiconductors are appealing to programmable optical control of spin-polarized carriers in ultrafast spintronics. To address the current thirsty for long-lived excitons with zero-external-field stability and room-temperature spin-polarization, we hereby predict the existence of intrinsically SML excitons in altermagnetic V$_2 X_2$O ($X=$ S, Se) driven by giant non-relativistic spin-splittings ($>$ 1.2 eV). First-principles calculations reveal SML excitons with binding energies exceeding 1400 meV in monolayers and 430 meV in their van der Waals heterobilayers, along with stacking-dependent optical selection rules for tunable interlayer excitons. These remarkable physical properties, combined with their long radiative lifetimes, strongly suggest the feasibility of SML excitons with robust spin-polarization at room temperature. Our work provides a new paradigm for SML exciton physics via the novel altermagnetism, opening up new possibilities for all-optical manipulation in advanced opto-spintronics.

Title: Hierarchy of localized many-body bound states in an interacting open lattice
Authors: Yanxia Liu, Shu Chen
Abstract: We unveil the mechanism for the formation of puzzled boundary-localized bound states in a spinless fermionic open lattice with nearest-neighbor interactions. By solving the Bethe-ansatz equation analytically, we uncover asymmetrical string solutions corresponding to the boundary-localized bound states, which emerge in systems with at least three particles. The localized bound states can become bound states in continuum in a suitable parameter region. When the number of particles increases to five or more, additional bound states away from the edge are also observed. Through rigorous analysis, we derive recurrence relations of the quasi-momentum of the localized states as a function of the number of particles, predicting the presence of hierarchy of localized many-body bound states in interacting open lattices.

Title: Unconventional Hall Effect in Gapless Superconductors: Transverse Supercurrent Converted from Normal Current
Authors: Miaomiao Wei, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Bin Wang, Jian Wang
Abstract: A normal metallic system proximitized by a superconductor can exhibit a gapless superconducting state characterized by segmented Fermi surfaces, as confirmed experimentally. In such a state, quasiparticle states remain gapless along one direction, while a superconducting gap opens in the perpendicular direction. This anisotropy enables a novel Hall effect in gapless superconductors, termed the superconducting Hall effect (ScHE), where a longitudinal normal current carried by quasiparticles is converted into a dissipationless transverse supercurrent. Employing both the thermodynamic approach for bulk systems and quantum transport theory for a four-probe setup, we demonstrate the existence of this effect and reveal its intrinsic origin as the quasiparticle Berry curvature. The predicted ScHE can be experimentally verified via the standard angular-dependent Hall measurements performed on gapless superconductors.

Title: Tuning the Chern number of Kitaev quantum spin liquid
Authors: Seong Jun Kwon, Kyusung Hwang, Suk Bum Chung
Abstract: It is now well understood that non-Kitaev spin interactions can be added to the Kitaev quantum spin liquid by applying external fields. Recent years have seen intensive discussion on the possible phase transitions that these spin interactions induce. In this paper, we will show through the perturbation theory the possibility of accessing a gapped spin liquid phase with a higher Chern number through, in contrast to the cases studied in literature, a continuous phase transition. Such a transition may be induced by external tuning parameters such as electric field and hydrostatic pressure.

Title: Higher-order thermal transport theory for phonon thermal transport in semiconductors using lattice dynamics calculations and the Boltzmann transport equation
Authors: Ankit Jain, Yagyank Srivastava, Amey G. Gokhale, Nidheesh Virakante, Hardik L. Kagdada
Abstract: The phonon thermal conductivity of semiconducting periodic solids can be obtained using the lattice dynamics calculations along with the Boltzmann transport equation and with input from density functional theory calculations. These calculations have resulted in an excellent agreement with experiments without requiring any fitting parameters. However, over the last decade, many material systems have been identified where the lowest level lattice dynamics theory, which is based on the relaxation time approximation solution of the Boltzmann transport equation and considers potential energy surface sampling around the static equilibrium positions of atoms with only three-phonon scatterings, is proved insufficient in describing the thermal transport physics. In this article, we review these higher-order developments in the lattice dynamics theory to describe thermal transport in periodic semiconducting solids. We start with a brief discussion of the lowest-order theory and discuss its limitations along with proposed developments to address these limitations. We discuss prominent success cases of these higher-order developments and present our recommendations on their use for various material systems. Considering that many of these higher-order developments are computationally more demanding compared to the lowest-order theory, we also discussed data-driven approaches to accelerate these calculations. This review article is intended to serve as a reference for both novice and experienced researchers in this field.

Title: Dynamic signature of the thermodynamic transition in a novel mean field system
Authors: Ehtesham Anwar, Ujjwal Kumar Nandi, Palak Patel, Sanket Kumawat, Sarika Maitra Bhattacharyya
Abstract: Understanding the connection between thermodynamics and dynamics in glass-forming liquids remains a central challenge in condensed matter physics. In this study, we investigate a novel model system that enables a continuous crossover from a standard three dimensional liquid to a fully connected mean field like system by introducing pseudo neighbours. These pseudo neighbours enhance the effective connectivity of the system without altering its local structure. While their presence slows down the dynamics, they influence thermodynamic properties even more significantly. In particular, the configurational entropy obtained via thermodynamic integration vanishes at a temperature much higher than the temperature where the dynamics begin to slow down, leading to a clear breakdown of the Adam Gibbs relation. To uncover a possible dynamical signature of this thermodynamic transition, we analyse bond breakage dynamics. Unlike real-real bonds, which decay similarly in both the parent Kob Andersen model and its mean field variant, real-pseudo bonds exhibit long lived, persistent behaviour with strong temperature dependence. These bonds do not fully decay over time, leading to a finite saturation value of the bond breakage correlation function. Remarkably, we show that the number of surviving pseudo bonds can be analytically estimated and correlates directly with the thermodynamic transition temperature T_K. We propose a phenomenological relation between T_K and the number of surviving pseudo-bonds, establishing a novel link between thermodynamic and dynamic observables. Our results suggest that these persistent pseudo bonds serve as a robust dynamical signature of the thermodynamic transition, and the system might have properties analogous to those of randomly bonded ultrastable glasses.

Title: Parton Mean-Field Theory of a Rydberg Quantum Spin Liquid induced by Density-Dependent Peierls Phases
Authors: Benno Bock, Simon Ohler, Michael Fleischhauer
Abstract: We derive a parton mean-field Hamiltonian for Rydberg excitations on a honeycomb lattice with nearest and density-dependent, complex next-nearest neighbor hopping. Numerical results obtained from exact diagonalization of small systems have given indications for a ground state that is a chiral spin liquid (CSL) [this http URL. 5, 013157 (2023)]. Here we provide further evidence for this. Calculating the ground-state wavefunction self-consistently, we show that the mean-field Hamiltonian fulfills the requirements for a CSL ground state, resulting from a projected symmetry group classification and verify the expected twofold topological degeneracy on a torus. Furthermore we find very good overlap with the ground-state wavefunctions obtained by exact diagonalization of the original Hamiltonian.

Abstract: A review of long-term studies of ZrB12 and LuB12 superconductors with very similar conduction bands and phonon spectra, but with radically different (by a factor of 15-20) critical temperatures and magnetic fields is presented. A detailed analysis of well-known studies in combination with new results of structural, thermodynamic and charge transport measurements obtained here for these metallic dodecaborides with Jahn-Teller instability of the rigid boron network and with dynamic charge stripes allows us to conclude in favor of the primary role of nanoscale effects of electron phase separation, leading to the formation of one-dimensional dynamic chains with different configurations of fluctuating charges, which in the case of ZrB12 are predominantly 2p-states, and for LuB12- 5d-2p states. We propose a new plasmon-phonon pairing mechanism in ZrB12, which may be common to different classes of high-Tc superconductors.

Title: Importance of pressure-dependent electronic interactions and magnetic order on pressure-driven insulator-metal transitions in MnO and NiO
Authors: Bei-Lei Liu, Yue-Chao Wang, Yuan-Ji Xu, Xingyu Gao, Hai-Feng Liu, Hai-Feng Song
Abstract: The pressure-driven insulator-metal transition is a crucial topic in condensed matter physics. However, even for the prototypical strongly correlated system, NiO, the critical pressure for transition remains debated. In this work, we evaluated the electronic interactions over a wide range of pressures based on our developed doubly-screened Coulomb correction method and investigated the effects of pressure-dependent electronic interactions and their interplay with magnetic order on the transition. As a validation of the method, we also performed calculations on MnO. The results show that the hybrid functional combined with pressure-dependent screening parameters reasonably describes the insulator-metal transition in MnO. The insulating band gap of antiferromagnetic (AFM) NiO also match well with experiments in both trend and value, which is better than the method using fixed parameters. Further calculations considering magnetic order indicate that as the electronic interactions weaken under pressure, the AFM state of NiO will no longer be stable, a phenomenon that was not observed in previous works. In addition, the results show that, compared with DFT+$U$ within the on-site Coulomb correction framework, the hybrid functional provides a more accurate description of the properties of MnO and NiO at high pressures, highlighting the key role of non-local effects. Our work provides a possible explanation for the long-standing discrepancies in NiO and offers guidance for the development of first-principles methods for correlated electron systems under pressure.

Title: Spin and Charge Control of Topological End States in Chiral Graphene Nanoribbons on a 2D Ferromagnet
Authors: Leonard Edens, Francisco Romero Lara, Trisha Sai, Kalyan Biswas, Manuel Vilas-Varela, Fabian Schulz, Diego Peña, Jose Ignacio Pascual
Abstract: Tailor-made graphene nanostructures can exhibit symmetry-protected topological boundary states that host localized spin-$1/2$ moments. However, one frequently observes charge transfer on coinage metal substrates, which results in spinless closed-shell configurations. Using low temperature scanning tunneling spectroscopy, we demonstrate here that pristine topologically nontrivial chiral graphene nanoribbons synthesized directly on the ferromagnet $\textrm{GdAu}_2$ can either maintain a charge-neutral diradical singlet or triplet configuration, or exist in a singly anionic doublet state. As an underlying mechanism, we identify a moiré-modulated work function and exchange field, as corroborated by Kelvin-probe force microscopy and spin-flip spectroscopy. The joint electrostatic and magnetic interactions allow reversibly switching between the three spin multiplicities by atomic manipulation. We introduce an effective Hubbard dimer model that unifies the effects of local electrostatic gating, electron-electron-correlation, hybridization and exchange field to outline the phase diagram of accessible spin states. Our results establish a platform for the local control of $\pi$-radicals adsorbed on metallic substrates.

Title: Unconventional magnon transport in antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$ induced by an anisotropic spin-flop transition
Authors: Peisen Yuan, Beatriz Martín-García, Evgeny Modin, M. Xochitl Aguilar-Pujol, Fèlix Casanova, Luis E. Hueso
Abstract: Nonlocal magnon transport can provide valuable insight into the magnetic properties of magnetic insulators (MIs). A spin-flop transition, a typical magnetic reorientation in antiferromagnets, is expected to affect mag non transport, but studies on this topic are still rare and remain challenging, especially for van der Waals materials. Here we demonstrate the unconventional magnon transport driven by an anisotropic spin-flop transition in the van der Waals antiferromagnet NiPS$_3$. Examining the nonlocal voltage from thermally driven magnons reveals sharp jumps at certain directions when an inplane magnetic field aligns with the b-axis of NiPS$_3$, attributed to an in-plane anisotropic spin-flop transition. Furthermore, thermally driven magnon signal exhibits a 1/d$^2$ decay in thin NiPS$_3$, evidencing that it is dominated by the intrinsic spin Seebeck effect. Our findings highlight that the electrical detection of magnon currents in a nonlocal device geometry serves as a powerful approach for studying magnetic phase transitions in MIs.

Title: Comment on "Long-range crossed Andreev reflection in a topological insulator nanowire proximitized by a superconductor" by Junya Feng et al
Authors: E.S. Tikhonov, V.S. Khrapai
Abstract: We argue that the interpretation of the experiment [Nature Physics 21, 708-715 (2025)] is misleading in two respects. First, the bias voltages impact the non-local differential conductance randomly, rather than systematically, and the bias symmetry of the non-local conductance in Fig. 3 can be explained by a fine tuned self-gating effect. Second, the full knowledge of the conductance matrix is insufficient to conclude on the relative values of the crossed-Andreev and elastic cotunneling probabilities, in particular on the dominance of one of them.

Title: Dominant Kitaev interaction and field-induced quantum phase transitions in triangular-lattice KCeSe2

Abstract: Realizing Kitaev interactions on triangular lattices offers a compelling platform for exploring quantum-spin-liquid physics beyond the conventional honeycomb lattice framework. Here, we investigate the triangular-lattice antiferromagnet KCeSe2, where multiple probes reveal strong magnetic anisotropy suggesting significant Kitaev physics. Through detailed and combined analysis of magnetization, neutron scattering, and thermodynamic experiments, we identify dominant ferromagnetic Kitaev ($K = -1.82$ K) and antiferromagnetic Heisenberg ($J = 1.34$ K) interactions that stabilize a stripe-$yz$ ordered ground state via an order-by-disorder mechanism. Magnetic fields applied along the Kitaev bond direction induce two phase transitions at 1.67 T and 3.8 T, consistent with density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations predictions of a progression from stripe-$yz$ to stripe-canted and spin-polarized phases. Near the 1.67 T quantum critical point, enhanced quantum fluctuations suggest conditions favorable for exotic excitations. These results establish KCeSe2 as a platform for exploring Kitaev physics on triangular lattices.

Title: Sequential tilting 4D-STEM for improved momentum-resolved STEM field mapping
Authors: Christoph Flathmann, Ulrich Ross, Jürgen Belz, Andreas Beyer, Kerstin Volz, Michael Seibt, Tobias Meyer
Abstract: Momentum-resolved scanning transmission electron microscopy (MRSTEM) is a powerful phase-contrast technique that can map lateral magnetic and electric fields ranging from the micrometer to the subatomic scale. Resolving fields ranging from a few nanometers to a few hundred nanometers, as well as across material junctions, is particularly important since these fields often determine the functional properties of devices. However, it is also challenging since they are orders of magnitude smaller than atomic electric fields. Thus, subtle changes in diffraction conditions lead to significant changes in the measured MRSTEM signal. One established approach to partially overcome this problem is precession electron diffraction, in which the incident electron beam is continuously precessed while precession-averaged diffraction patterns are acquired. Here, we present an alternative approach in which we sequentially tilt the incident electron beam and record a full diffraction pattern for each tilt and spatial position. This approach requires no hardware modification of the instrument and enables the use of arbitrary beam tilt patterns that can be optimized for specific applications. Furthermore, recording diffraction patterns for every beam tilt allows access to additional information. In this work, we use this information to create virtual large-angle convergent beam electron diffraction (vLACBED) patterns to assess MRSTEM data quality and improve field measurements by applying different data analysis methods beyond simple averaging. The presented data acquisition concept can readily be applied to other 4D-STEM applications.

Title: X-ray diffraction from smectic multilayers: crossover from kinematical to dynamical regime
Authors: V. V. Samsonov, K. V. Nikolaev, B. I. Ostrovskii, S. N. Yakunin
Abstract: We study X-ray diffraction in smectic liquid crystal multilayers. Such systems are fabricated as freely suspended films and have a unique layered structure. As such, they can be described as organic Bragg mirrors with sub-nanometer roughness. However, an interesting peculiarity arises in the diffraction on these structures: the characteristic shape of diffraction peaks associated with dynamical scattering effects is not observed. Instead, the diffraction can be well described kinematically, which is atypical for Bragg mirrors. In this article we investigate the transition between the kinematical and dynamical regimes of diffraction. For this purpose, we analyze the reflection of synchrotron radiation on a real liquid crystal sample with both kinematical and dynamical theories. Furthermore, based on these theories, we derive a quantitative criterion for the transition from the kinematical to the dynamical regime. This, in turn, allows us to explain the peculiar diffraction behavior in smectic films with thicknesses exceeding thousands of molecular layers.

Title: Unconventional Temperature Dependence of Exciton Diamagnetism in 2D Ruddlesden-Popper Lead Halide Perovskites
Authors: William A. Smith, Fumiya Katsutani, Jin Hou, Hao Zhang, Jean-Christophe Blancon, Hiroyuki Nojiri, Aditya D. Mohite, Andrey Baydin, Junichiro Kono, Hanyu Zhu
Abstract: Layered hybrid perovskites containing larger organic cations have demonstrated superior environmental stability, but the presence of these insulating spacers also strengthens the exciton binding energy, which contributes to reduced carrier separation. The consequences of increased binding energy on device efficiency are still not fully documented, and binding energy measurements are often conducted at cryogenic temperatures where linewidths are decreased and a series of hydrogen-like bound states can be identified, but not under ambient conditions where devices are expected to operate. In contrast to the quenching observed in 3D perovskites such as methylammonium lead iodide, where exciton binding energies are thought to decrease at higher temperatures, we present evidence for a smaller excitonic radius at higher temperatures in the $n=5$ member of butylammonium-spaced methylammonium lead iodide, (BA)$_2$(MA)$_{n-1}$Pb$_n$I$_{3n+1}$. We measured the temperature-dependent diamagnetic shift coefficient in magnetic fields up to 40\,T, which is one-third as large at room temperature as those at cryogenic temperatures. In both the ideal 2D and 3D hydrogen models, this trend would indicate that the exciton binding energy more than triples at room temperature.

Title: Si(100)-SiO$_2$ Trap Density Dependence on Sample Processing
Authors: Adam J. Czarnecki, Nikola L. Kolev, Patrick See, Nick Sullivan, Wyatt A. Behn, Neil J. Curson, Taylor J.Z. Stock, Peter Grütter
Abstract: As silicon-based devices continue to shrink to the nanoscale, traps at the Si-SiO$_2$ interface pose increasing challenges to device performance. These traps reduce channel carrier mobility and shift threshold voltages in integrated circuits, and introduce charge noise in quantum systems, reducing their coherence times. Knowledge of the precise location of such traps aids in understanding their influence on device performance. In this work, we demonstrate that frequency-modulated atomic force microscopy (fm-AFM) allows the detection of individual traps. We use this to study how sample preparation, specifically the introduction of a buried hydrogen termination layer, and post-processing annealing in forming gas (N$_2$+H$_2$), affects the density of donor-like traps in Si(100)-SiO$_2$ systems. We spatially map and quantify traps in both conventionally prepared ("pristine") silicon samples and those processed under ultra-high vacuum for hydrogen resist lithography (HRL). We confirm previous studies demonstrating hydrogen passivation of traps and find that hydrogen termination further reduces the donor-like trap density. We also observe a significant reduction in two-level donor-like traps in the hydrogen-terminated samples compared to pristine silicon samples. These findings suggest that HRL-prepared silicon may offer advantages for high-performance nanoscale and atomic-scale devices due to reduced trap densities.

Title: Eigenstate Thermalization Hypothesis (ETH) for off-diagonal matrix elements in integrable spin chains
Authors: Federico Rottoli, Vincenzo Alba
Abstract: We investigate off-diagonal matrix elements of local operators in integrable spin chains, focusing on the isotropic spin-$1/2$ Heisenberg chain ($XXX$ chain). We employ state-of-the-art Algebraic Bethe Ansatz results, which allow us to efficiently compute matrix elements of operators with support up to two sites between generic energy eigenstates. We consider both matrix elements between eigenstates that are in the same thermodynamic macrostate, as well as eigenstates that belong to different macrostates. In the former case, focusing on thermal states we numerically show that matrix elements are compatible with the exponential decay as $\exp(-L |{M}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}_{ij}|)$. The probability distribution functions of ${M}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}$ depend on the observable and on the macrostate, and are well described by Gumbel distributions. On the other hand, matrix elements between eigenstates in different macrostates decay faster as $\exp(-|{M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle{\mathcal{O}}}|L^2)$, with ${M'}_{ij}^{\scriptscriptstyle \mathcal{O}}$, again, compatible with a Gumbel distribution.

Title: Localized surface plasmons in a Weyl semimetal nanosphere
Authors: Francesco M. D. Pellegrino, Francesco Buccheri, G. G. N. Angilella
Abstract: In this study, we investigate the localized surface plasmon modes of a sub-wavelength spherical nanoparticle composed of a Weyl semimetal, taking into account the axion modification of electrodynamics. We derive analytical solutions for dipole and quadrupole normal modes by employing the quasistatic approximation. The axion term leads to modified Fröhlich conditions, resulting in multiple non-degenerate plasmonic resonances with distinct polarization dependencies. In contrast to isotropic conventional metals, the magnetoelectric properties of Weyl semimetals enable an incident electromagnetic field, with the electric field transverse to the surface of the sphere, to excite a localized surface plasmon.

Title: Measuring topological invariants of even-dimensional non-Hermitian systems through quench dynamics
Authors: Xiao-Dong Lin, Long Zhang
Abstract: The accurate determination of non-Hermitian (NH) topological invariants plays a central role in the study of NH topological phases. In this work, we propose a general framework for directly measuring NH topological invariants in even-dimensional systems through quench dynamics. Our approach hinges on constructing an auxiliary Hermitian matrix topologically equivalent to the original NH Hamiltonian, enabling topological characterization via reduced-dimensional momentum subspaces called band inversion surfaces (BISs). A key insight lies in the emergence of chiral symmetry in the NH Hamiltonian specifically on BISs -- a critical property that allows extension of the dynamical characterization scheme previously developed for odd-dimensional NH systems with chiral or sublattice symmetry [Lin et al., Phys. Rev. Res. 7, L012060 (2025)]. We show that NH topological invariants can be extracted from the winding patterns of a dynamical field constructed from post-quench spin textures on BISs. We demonstrate our approach through a detailed analysis of NH Chern insulators and then extend the framework to higher even-dimensional systems by introducing second-order BISs for characterization. This work establishes an experimentally accessible protocol for detecting NH topological invariants in quantum platforms.

Title: Higher-order Tuning of Interface Physics in Multiphase Lattice Boltzmann
Authors: Matteo Lulli, Emily S. C. Ching
Abstract: Tuning the interface properties of multiphase models is of paramount importance to the final goal of achieving a one-to-one matching with nucleation and cavitation experiments. The surface tension, at the leading order, and the Tolman length, at higher order, play a crucial role in the estimation of the free-energy barrier determining the experimentally observed nucleation rates. The lattice Boltzmann method allows for a computationally efficient modelling approach of multiphase flows, however, tuning results are concerned with the surface tension and neglect the Tolman length. We present a novel perspective that leverages all the degrees of freedom hidden in the forcing stencil of the Shan-Chen multiphase model. By means of the lattice pressure tensor we determine and tune the coefficients of higher-order derivative terms related to surface tension and Tolman length at constant interface width and density ratio. We test the method by means of both hydrostatic and dynamic simulations and demonstrate the dependence of homogeneous nucleation rates on the value of the Tolman length. This work provides a new tool that can be integrated with previously existing strategies thus marking a step forwards to a high-fidelity modelling of phase-changing fluid dynamics.

Title: Shot noise from which-path detection in a chiral Majorana interferometer
Authors: C.W.J.Beenakker
Abstract: We calculate the full counting statistics of charge transfer in a chiral Majorana interferometer - a setup where a Dirac mode (an electron-hole mode) is split into two Majorana modes that encircle a number of h/2e vortices in a topological superconductor. Without any coupling to the environment it is known that the low-energy charge transfer is deterministic: An electron is transferred either as an electron or as a hole, dependent on the parity of the vortex number. We show that a stochastic contribution appears if which-path information leaks into the environment, producing the shot noise of random 2e charge transfers with binomial statistics. The Fano factor (dimensionless ratio of shot noise power and conductance) increases without bound as the which-path detection probability tends to unity.

Title: Diffusive noise controls early stages of genetic demixing
Authors: Rashmiranjan Bhutia, Stephy Jose, Prasad Perlekar, Kabir Ramola
Abstract: Theoretical descriptions of the stepping-stone model, a cornerstone of spatial population genetics, have long overlooked diffusive noise arising from migration dynamics. We derive an exact fluctuating hydrodynamic description of this model from microscopic rules, which we then use to demonstrate that diffusive noise significantly alters early-time genetic demixing, which we characterize through heterozygosity, a key measure of diversity. Combining macroscopic fluctuation theory and microscopic simulations, we demonstrate that the scaling of density fluctuations in a spatial domain displays an early-time behaviour dominated by diffusive noise. Our exact results underscore the need for additional terms in existing continuum theories and highlight the necessity of including diffusive noise in models of spatially structured populations.

Title: Dyn-HTE: High-temperature expansion of the dynamic Matsubara spin correlator
Authors: Ruben Burkard, Benedikt Schneider, Björn Sbierski
Abstract: The high-temperature series expansion for quantum spin models is a well-established tool to compute thermodynamic quantities and equal-time spin correlations, in particular for frustrated interactions. We extend the scope of this expansion to the dynamic Matsubara spin-spin correlator and develop a fully analytic algorithm to compute its expansion coefficients. We focus on Heisenberg models with a single coupling constant J and spin lengths S=1/2,1. The expansion coefficients up to 12th order in J/T are precomputed on all possible ~10^6 graphs embeddable in arbitrary lattices and are provided under this https URL. This enables calculation of static momentum-resolved susceptibilities for arbitrary site-pairs or wavevectors. We test our results for the S=1/2 Heisenberg chain and on the triangular lattice model. Moreover, the analytic frequency dependence in the expansion allows for stable analytic continuation to the real-frequency dynamic structure factor. This important application is discussed in a companion letter.

Title: Group Convolutional Neural Network Ground State of the Quantum Dimer Model
Authors: Ojasvi Sharma, Sandipan Manna, Prashant Shekhar Rao, G J Sreejith
Abstract: We estimate the ground state of the square lattice Quantum Dimer Model in a $\rm{p4m}$-symmetric Group Convolutional Neural Network (GCNN) representation and show that results in agreement with exact diagonalization (ED) and quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) can be obtained with a $\mathcal{L}=2$ layer network. In systems of linear size $L=8$ with Hilbert space dimension $3.1\times 10^8$, GCNN shows fidelity as high as $0.99999$ with ED. For $12\leq L\leq 32$, we find excellent agreement with QMC estimates of energy, order parameters and correlation functions. The network is optimized by minimizing the energy estimated from a Metropolis algorithm assisted by a directed loop sampler. We analyze the quantum geometric tensor at the minima for $\mathcal{L}=1,2$ and $3$ and show that the empirical quantum dimension saturates with increasing network complexity due to Metropolis sampling constraints.

Title: Fermion parity and quantum capacitance oscillation with partially separated Majorana and quasi-Majorana modes
Authors: Tudor D. Stanescu, Sumanta Tewari
Abstract: In a recent experiment, flux dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance were observed in a one dimensional spin-orbit coupled semiconductor superconductor heterostructure connected end to end via a quantum dot and threaded by a magnetic flux. In the topological superconducting phase of the heterostructure, the oscillations corresponding to different fermion parity sectors are shifted by half a period and can serve as a mechanism for fermion parity readout or fusion operations involving a pair of localized, well separated Majorana modes. In this work, we demonstrate that flux induced fermion parity dependent oscillations of the quantum capacitance in a disordered semiconductor superconductor quantum dot system can originate not only from topologically protected, spatially well separated Majorana zero modes (MZMs) localized at the wire ends, but also, generically, from partially separated Majorana modes with significant overlap, as well as from quasi-Majorana modes in the topologically trivial phase, which can be viewed as Andreev bound states whose constituent Majorana wave functions are slightly shifted relative to each other and have nonzero amplitude at opposite ends of the wire. Therefore, while the detection of flux dependent oscillations of quantum capacitance marks an important experimental advance, such observations alone do not constitute evidence of the presence of topological Majorana zero modes.

Title: Flow to Nishimori universality in weakly monitored quantum circuits with qubit loss
Authors: Malte Pütz, Romain Vasseur, Andreas W.W. Ludwig, Simon Trebst, Guo-Yi Zhu
Abstract: In circuit-based quantum state preparation, qubit loss and coherent errors are circuit imperfections that imperil the formation of long-range entanglement beyond a certain threshold. The critical theory at the threshold is a continuous entanglement transition known to be described by a (2+0)-dimensional non-unitary conformal field theory which, for the two types of imperfections of certain circuits, is described by either percolation or Nishimori criticality, respectively. Here we study the threshold behavior when the two types of errors simultaneously occur and show that, when moving away from the Clifford-regime of projective stabilizer measurements, the percolation critical point becomes unstable and the critical theory flows to Nishimori universality. We track this critical renormalization group (RG) crossover flow by mapping out the entanglement phase diagrams, parametrized by the probability and strength of random weak measurements, of two dual protocols preparing surface code or GHZ-class cat states from a parent cluster state via constant-depth circuits. Extensive numerical simulations, using hybrid Gaussian fermion and tensor network / Monte Carlo sampling techniques on systems with more than a million qubits, demonstrate that an infinitesimal deviation from the Clifford regime leads to a sudden, strongly non-monotonic entanglement growth at the incipient non-unitary RG flow. We argue that spectra of scaling dimensions of both the percolation and Nishimori fixed points exhibit multifractality. For percolation, we provide the exact (non-quadratic) multifractal spectrum of exponents, while for the Nishimori fixed point we show high-precision numerical results for five leading exponents characterizing multifractality.

Title: Quantum Simulations of Charge and Exciton Transfer in Multi-mode Models using Engineered Reservoirs
Authors: Visal So, Midhuna Duraisamy Suganthi, Mingjian Zhu, Abhishek Menon, George Tomaras, Roman Zhuravel, Han Pu, Peter G. Wolynes, José N. Onuchic, Guido Pagano
Abstract: Quantum simulation offers a route to study open-system molecular dynamics in non-perturbative regimes by programming the interactions among electronic, vibrational, and environmental degrees of freedom on similar energy scales. Trapped-ion systems possess this capability, with their native spins, phonons, and tunable dissipation integrated within a single platform. Here, we demonstrate an open-system quantum simulation of charge and exciton transfer in a multi-mode linear vibronic coupling model (LVCM). Employing tailored spin-phonon interactions alongside reservoir engineering techniques, we emulate a system with two dissipative vibrational modes coupled to donor and acceptor electronic sites and follow its excitation transfer in real time. We continuously drive the system from the charge transfer (CT) regime to the vibrationally assisted exciton transfer (VAET) regime by tuning the vibronic coupling strengths. We find that degenerate modes enhance CT and VAET rates at large energy gaps, while non-degenerate modes activate slow-mode pathways that reduce the energy-gap dependence, thus enlarging the window for efficient transfer. These results show that the presence of just one additional vibration reshapes non-perturbative quantum excitation transfer. Our work also establishes a scalable route to simulating chemically relevant, many-mode vibronic processes with engineered environments, guiding the design of next-generation organic photovoltaics and molecular electronics.

Title: Exact analysis of AC sensors based on Floquet time crystals
Authors: Andrei Tsypilnikov, Matheus Fibger, Fernando Iemini
Abstract: We discuss the behavior of general Floquet Time Crystals (FTCs), including prethermal ones, in closed systems acting as AC sensors. We provide an analytical treatment of their quantum Fisher information (QFI) dynamics, which characterizes the ultimate sensor accuracy. By tuning the direction and frequency of the AC field, we show how to resonantly induce transitions between macroscopic paired cat states in the FTC sensor, allowing a robust Heisenberg scaling precision (QFI $\sim N^2 t^2$) for exponentially long times in the system size. The QFI dynamics exhibit, moreover, a characteristic step-like structure in time due to the eventual dephasing along the cat subspaces. The behavior is discussed for different relevant initial preparations of the sensor, including ground states, low and high correlated states. Furthermore, we examine the performance of the sensor along the FTC phase transition, with the QFI capturing its critical exponents. We present our findings for both linear and nonlinear response regimes, and illustrate them for a specific FTC based on the long-range interacting LMG model.

Title: Langer's nucleation rate reproduced on the lattice
Authors: Joonas Hirvonen, Oliver Gould
Abstract: We show that Langer's rate of bubble nucleation is quantitatively correct up to small higher-loop corrections, in comparison to lattice simulations. These results are a significant advancement on decades of lattice studies showing only qualitative trends, and the first showing agreement for any conservative system. We confirm that the failure to fully thermalize the metastable phase explains discrepancies with recent lattice studies that found disagreement with Langer's rate. The key theoretical development is the translation of Langer's perturbative definition of a thermal metastable phase into a nonperturbative statement that can be implemented on the lattice. Our statistical and systematic errors are small enough to allow us to measure on the lattice the coefficient of the two-loop contribution, missing from the perturbative prediction. Our conclusions also exclude a possible systematic uncertainty in $^3$He experiments.

Title: Interpretable Scaling Behavior in Sparse Subnetwork Representations of Quantum States
Authors: Brandon Barton, Juan Carrasquilla, Christopher Roth, Agnes Valenti
Abstract: The Lottery Ticket Hypothesis (LTH) posits that within overparametrized neural networks, there exist sparse subnetworks that are capable of matching the performance of the original model when trained in isolation from the original initialization. We extend this hypothesis to the unsupervised task of approximating the ground state of quantum many-body Hamiltonians, a problem equivalent to finding a neural-network compression of the lowest-lying eigenvector of an exponentially large matrix. Focusing on two representative quantum Hamiltonians, the transverse field Ising model (TFIM) and the toric code (TC), we demonstrate that sparse neural networks can reach accuracies comparable to their dense counterparts, even when pruned by more than an order of magnitude in parameter count. Crucially, and unlike the original LTH, we find that performance depends only on the structure of the sparse subnetwork, not on the specific initialization, when trained in isolation. Moreover, we identify universal scaling behavior that persists across network sizes and physical models, where the boundaries of scaling regions are determined by the underlying Hamiltonian. At the onset of high-error scaling, we observe signatures of a sparsity-induced quantum phase transition that is first-order in shallow networks. Finally, we demonstrate that pruning enhances interpretability by linking the structure of sparse subnetworks to the underlying physics of the Hamiltonian.

Title: Quantum cooling below absolute zero
Authors: Francesco Libbi, Lorenzo Monacelli, Boris Kozinsky
Abstract: Similar to other perovskites in its family, SrTiO$_3$ exhibits a significant softening of the ferroelectric mode with decreasing temperature, a behavior that typically heralds the onset of a ferroelectric transition. However, this material remains paraelectric down to 0K due to the Heisenberg quantum uncertainty principle that prevents atoms from localizing in the ferroelectric minima, a fundamental limit that appears impossible to overcome. This work shows that in the strong out-of-equilibrium regime induced by resonant mid-IR pulses, quantum fluctuations can be suppressed, effectively cooling the material below the 0K ground state and inducing a ferroelectric transition in SrTiO$_3$ that is otherwise impossible. The appearance of a metastable state, that is distinct from the conventional ground state, is the first demonstration of how it is possible to leverage and control quantum fluctuations with pulsed light to qualitatively alter the free energy landscape of a quantum system. We predict the conditions and system parameter under which induced non-equilibrium state can be long-lived and even permanent. In providing a quantitative description, based on first principles machine learned potential energy surface, we explain recent experimental observations of light-induced ferroelectric transition in this material.

Title: Provably Efficient Quantum Thermal State Preparation via Local Driving
Authors: Dominik Hahn, S. A. Parameswaran, Benedikt Placke
Abstract: Preparing the thermal density matrix $\rho_{\beta}\propto e^{-\beta H}$ corresponding to a given Hamiltonian $H$ is a task of central interest across quantum many-body physics, and is particularly salient when attempting to study it with quantum computers. Although solved {in principle} by recent constructions of efficiently simulable Lindblad master equations -- that provably have $\rho_{\beta}$ as a steady state [C.-F. Chen {\it et al}, arXiv:2311.09207] -- their implementation requires large-scale quantum computational resources and is hence challenging {in practice} on current or even near-term quantum devices. Here, we propose a scheme for approximately preparing quantum thermal states that only requires the [repeated] implementation of three readily available ingredients: (a) analog simulation of $H$; (b) strictly local but time-dependent couplings to ancilla qubits; and (c) reset of the ancillas. We give rigorous performance guarantees independent of detailed physical knowledge of $H$ beyond its locality.

Title: Generating discrete time crystals through optimal control
Authors: Mrutyunjaya Sahoo, Rahul Ghosh, Bandita Das, Shishira Mahunta, Bodhaditya Santra, Victor Mukherjee
Abstract: In this work we use optimal control to generate Discrete Time Crystals (DTC) in generic many-body quantum systems. We define appropriate cost functions, which, when optimized, result in the formation of DTCs. This hitherto unexplored method represents DTCs as an optimization problem, and allows us to find non-trivial realistic periodic control pulses and parameter regimes which result in spontaneous breaking of time-translational symmetry in quantum systems. We exemplify our approach using many-body quantum systems in the presence, as well as absence of dissipation. We also discuss possible experimental realization of the control protocol for generating DTCs.

Title: On the generic increase of entropy in isolated systems
Authors: Zhiqiang Huang, Qing-yu Cai
Abstract: This study establishes a universal mechanism for entropy production in isolated quantum systems governed by the eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH). By developing a resolvent-based framework, we demonstrate that steady-state entropy generically arises from many-body interactions, independent of specific coupling details. Analytical arguments reveal that entropy generation is driven by two universal pathways: interaction-induced energy broadening and temporal coarse-graining over exponentially small energy gaps. Numerical simulations of nonintegrable Ising spin chains confirm logarithmic entropy scaling, consistent with predictions derived from ETH-governed eigenstate mixing. The derived self-consistent equations for energy shift and broadening parameters agree closely with numerical results. These results unify observational entropy concepts with von Neumann entropy dynamics, providing predictive tools for thermodynamic behavior in quantum many-body systems. Our findings resolve longstanding debates about interaction-dependent entropy scaling and offer pathways for entropy control in quantum technologies.

Title: Bridging the classical and quantum regimes in a dissipative Ising chain
Authors: Zhenming Zhang, Haowei Li, Wei Yi
Abstract: We study the long-time dynamics of a dissipative Ising chain with varying quantum correlation. Invoking an ensemble-average formalism, and assuming spatial translation symmetry, we show that the dynamics can be described by a Lindblad master equation with an interpolated coherent Hamiltonian. In the classical limit, the interpolation Hamiltonian leads to a set of nonlinear equations of motion, where limit cycles can emerge in the long-time dynamics. In the quantum limit, by contrast, the system approaches a ferromagnetic steady state at long times. In between the two extremes, the discrete spatial translation symmetry can be spontaneously broken, as an antiferromagnetic steady state emerges, bridging the classical and quantum regimes. In particular, we illustrate how the classical limit-cycle behavior gradually disappears with the increase of quantum correlation. Since our model in the two extremes respectively applies to a dissipative Rydberg gas in the high- and zero-temperature limits, we expect it to provide an effective description of dissipative Rydberg gases at interim temperatures, and shed light on the fate of limit cycles in a quantum open system.

Title: Two identical 1D anyons with zero-range interactions: Exchange statistics, scattering theory, and anyon-anyon mapping
Authors: Raúl Hidalgo-Sacoto, Thomas Busch, D. Blume
Abstract: While elementary particles obey either bosonic or fermionic exchange statistics, generalized exchange statistics that interpolate between bosons and fermions -- applicable to quasi-particles -- constitute an intriguing topic, both from the fundamental and practical points of view. This work develops a scattering framework for two identical 1D bosonic anyons and two identical 1D fermionic anyons with zero-range contact interactions. The two-body system with zero-range interactions, both in free space and under external confinement, is used to illustrate the recently proposed bosonic-anyon -- fermionic-anyon mapping~(R. Hidalgo-Sacoto {\em{et al.}}, arXiv:2505.17669), which connects the eigenstates of bosonic anyons to those of fermionic anyons and vice versa. Performing explicit calculations for two-particle systems, the momentum distributions and the off-diagonal correlations of the single-particle density matrix for bosonic anyons and fermionic anyons are confirmed to be distinct. We also confirm the previously derived asymptotic coefficients of the momentum distribution tail at orders $k^{-2}$ and $k^{-3}$ for two harmonically confined anyons. Non-universal contributions at order $k^{-4}$ are discussed.

Title: Intermediate State Formation of Topologically Associated Chromatin Domains using Quantum Annealing
Authors: Tobias Kempe, S.M. Ali Tabei, Mohammad H. Ansari
Abstract: Topologically Associating Chromatic Domains are spatially distinct chromatin regions that regulate transcription by segregating active and inactive genomic elements. Empirical studies show that their formation correlates with local patterns of epigenetic markers, yet the precise mechanisms linking 1D epigenetic landscapes to 3D chromatin folding remain unclear. Recent models represent chromatin as a spin system, where nucleosomes are treated as discrete-state variables coupled by interaction strengths derived from genomic and epigenomic data. Classical samplers struggle with these models due to high frustration and dense couplings. Here, we present a quantum annealing (QA) approach to efficiently sample chromatin states, embedding an epigenetic Ising model into the topology of D-Wave quantum processors.

Title: Phase transitions in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barabási-Albert graph with participation cost
Authors: Jacek Miȩkisz, Javad Mohamadichamgavi
Abstract: We examine the impact of the maintenance cost of social links on cooperative behavior in the Prisoner's Dilemma game on the Barabási-Albert scale-free network with a pairwise stochastic imitation. We show by means of Monte Carlo simulations and pair approximation that the cooperation frequency changes abruptly from an almost full cooperation to a much smaller value when we increase the cost of maintaining links. In the critical region, the stationary distribution is bi-modal and the system oscillates between two states: the state with almost full cooperation and one with coexisting strategies. We show that the critical region shrinks with the increasing size of the population. However, the expected time the system spends in a metastable state before switching to the other one does not change as a function of the system's size, which precludes the existence of two stationary states in the thermodynamic limit of the infinite population.

Title: Condensates, crystals, and renormalons in the Gross-Neveu model at finite density
Authors: Francesco Benini, Ohad Mamroud, Tomas Reis, Marco Serone
Abstract: We study the $O(2N)$ symmetric Gross-Neveu model at finite density in the presence of a $U(1)$ chemical potential $h$ for a generic number $a \leq N-2$ of fermion fields. By combining perturbative QFT, semiclassical large $N$, and Bethe ansatz techniques, we show that at finite $N$ two new dynamically generated scales $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and $\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$ appear in the theory, governing the mass gap of neutral and charged fermions, respectively. Above a certain threshold value for $h$, $a$-fermion bound states condense and form an inhomogeneous configuration, which at infinite $N$ is a crystal spontaneously breaking translations. At large $h$, this crystal has mean $\Lambda_\mathrm{n}$ and spatial oscillations of amplitude $2\Lambda_\mathrm{c}$. The two scales also control the nonperturbative corrections to the free energy, resolving a puzzle concerning fractional-power renormalons and predicting new ones.

Title: Optimization and variability can coexist
Authors: Marianne Bauer, William Bialek, Chase Goddard, Caroline M. Holmes, Kamesh Krishnamurthy, Stephanie E. Palmer, Rich Pang, David J. Schwab, Lee Susman
Abstract: Many biological systems perform close to their physical limits, but promoting this optimality to a general principle seems to require implausibly fine tuning of parameters. Using examples from a wide range of systems, we show that this intuition is wrong. Near an optimum, functional performance depends on parameters in a "sloppy'' way, with some combinations of parameters being only weakly constrained. Absent any other constraints, this predicts that we should observe widely varying parameters, and we make this precise: the entropy in parameter space can be extensive even if performance on average is very close to optimal. This removes a major objection to optimization as a general principle, and rationalizes the observed variability.

Abstract: Atom interferometers deployed in space are excellent tools for high precision measurements, navigation, or Earth observation. In particular, differential interferometric setups feature common-mode noise suppression and enable reliable measurements in the presence of ambient platform noise. Here we report on orbital magnetometry campaigns performed with differential single- and double-loop interferometers in NASA's Cold Atom Lab aboard the International Space Station. By comparing measurements with atoms in magnetically sensitive and insensitive states, we have realized atomic magnetometers mapping magnetic field curvatures. Our results pave the way towards precision quantum sensing missions in space.

Title: Fischer Information of a Nonequilibrium Anharmonic Donor-Acceptor Rectifier
Authors: Bitap Raj Thakuria, Trishna Kalita, Javed Akhtar, Himangshu Prabal Goswami
Abstract: We investigate a nonequilibrium donor-acceptor quantum rectifier system coupled to an anharmonic vibrational mode, treating the vibrational dynamics both as a two-level system and as multilevel system. The time-dependent Fischer information is then calculated by deriving a quantum master equation for the reduced system dynamics. We estimate some key rectifier parameters, the donor energy, the acceptor energy, and the vibrational frequency. We report that there is an optimal time for estimating the donor and acceptor energy. However, the anharmonic mode can be estimated better only in the steadystate. The acceptor energy is found to be most precisely estimable, especially under strong coupling and high bias. Donor energy shows limited sensitivity, while vibrational frequency estimation benefits from low temperatures. This work offers a theoretical foundation for enhancing parameter estimation in nanoscale quantum devices, guiding future sensing and metrological applications in quantronic systems.

Title: Fluxonium as a control qubit for bosonic quantum information
Authors: Ke Nie, J. Nofear Bradford, Supriya Mandal, Aayam Bista, Wolfgang Pfaff, Angela Kou
Abstract: Bosonic codes in superconducting resonators are a hardware-efficient avenue for quantum error correction and can harness the favorable error hierarchies provided by long-lived cavities compared to typical superconducting qubits. These benefits can be negated, however, by the necessary coupling to an ancillary control qubit, which often induces highly detrimental effects such as excess decoherence and undesired nonlinearities. It is thus an important question whether a qubit-cavity coupling can be realized that avoids such effects. Here, we investigate the fluxonium as control qubit, motivated by its long lifetime and controllability of Hamiltonian parameters that suggest an avenue toward controlled elimination of undesired nonlinearities. In a proof-of-concept experiment we use the fluxonium to measure the coherence properties of a storage resonator and demonstrate the predictability of the cavity's inherited nonlinearities from the fluxonium. We demonstrate universal control by preparing and characterizing resonator Fock states and their superpositions using selective number-dependent arbitrary phase gates. The fidelities of state preparation and tomography are accounted for by incoherent resonator decay errors in our planar prototype device. Finally, we predict that the fluxonium can achieve beneficial cavity-coupling regimes compared to the transmon, with the potential to eliminate undesirable cavity nonlinearities. These results demonstrate the potential of the fluxonium as a high-performance bosonic control qubit for superconducting cavities.

Title: Entropy Production for Discrete-Time Markov Processes
Authors: Masanao Igarashi
Abstract: We study the multiple definitions of the entropy production for discrete-time Markov processes in single systems and composite systems. These definitions have been studied in single systems, but less so in composite systems. With a clear distinction, we review the equivalence condition and the meaning of the multiple definitions and show that all definitions satisfy the important property for the entropy production, such as non-negativity. We also show that the inequalities between total entropy production and marginal entropy production holds for a definition but doesn't for another definition. Furthermore, we verify that fact by calculating entropy productions for Gaussian process and numerically show the result. Finally, we find appropriate use of each definition taking all results into account.

Title: Born effective charges and vibrational spectra in super and bad conducting metals
Authors: Guglielmo Marchese, Francesco Macheda, Luca Binci, Matteo Calandra, Paolo Barone, Francesco Mauri
Abstract: Interactions mediated by electron-phonon coupling are responsible for important cooperative phenomena in metals such as superconductivity and charge-density waves. The same interaction mechanisms produce strong collision rates in the normal phase of correlated metals, causing sizeable reductions of the dc conductivity and reflectivity. As a consequence, low-energy excitations like phonons, which are crucial for materials characterization, become visible in optical infrared spectra. A quantitative assessment of vibrational resonances requires the evaluation of dynamical Born effective charges, which quantify the coupling between macroscopic electric fields and lattice deformations. We show that the Born effective charges of metals crucially depend on the collision regime of conducting electrons. In particular, we describe, within a first principles framework, the impact of electron scattering on the infrared vibrational resonances, from the undamped, collisionless regime to the overdamped, collision-dominated limit. Our approach enables the interpretation of vibrational reflectance measurements of both super and bad conducting metals, as we illustrate for the case of strongly electron-phonon coupled superhydride H$_3$S.

Title: Electrical detection of interfacial exchange field at the (ferromagnetic insulator)|(normal metal) interface using spin-dependent scattering
Authors: Prasanta Muduli, Naëmi Leo, Mingran Xu, Zheng Zhu, Jorge Puebla, Christian Ortiz, Hironari Isshiki, YoshiChika Otani
Abstract: The spin-orbit field and interfacial exchange field are two major interface phenomena, and the detection and manipulation of these fields can enable a variety of nanoscale spintronics devices. Optimizing the interfacial exchange field, which governs the spin-dependent scattering asymmetry at (ferromagnetic insulator)-(normal metal) interfaces, will pave the way for next-generation nanoscale, low-power insulator spintronics devices. Here, we demonstrate an experimental pathway to detect an interfacial exchange field between insulating ferromagnet EuS and non-magnetic Cu using magnetoresistance measurements, and show that the spin-dependent scattering at the common interface can lead to a significant current-in-plane magnetoresistance in Py$|$Cu$|$EuS trilayer Hall-bar device. Our experiment suggests that simple magnetoresistance measurements can be used to experimentally detect the interfacial exchange field and thereby the magnetic state of a ferromagnetic insulator.

Title: Two-particle self-consistent approach for broken symmetry phases
Authors: Lorenzo Del Re
Abstract: Spontaneous symmetry breaking of interacting fermion systems constitutes a major challenge for many-body theory due to the proliferation of new independent scattering channels once absent or degenerate in the symmetric phase. One example is given by the ferro/antiferromagnetic broken symmetry phase (BSP) of the Hubbard model, where vertices in the spin-transverse and spin-longitudinal channels become independent with a consequent increase in the computational power for their calculation. We generalise the non-perturbative Two-Particle- Self-Consistent method (TPSC) to address broken SU(2) magnetic phases in the Hubbard model, offering an efficient approach that incorporates strong correlations. We show that in the BSP, the sum-rule enforcement of susceptibilities must be accompanied by a modified gap equation resulting in a renormalisation of the order parameter, vertex corrections and the preservation of the gap-less feature of the Goldstone modes. We then apply the theory to the antiferromagnetic phase of the Hubbard model in the cubic lattice at half-filling. We compare our results of double occupancies and staggered magnetisation to the ones obtained using Diagrammatic Monte Carlo showing excellent quantitative agreement. We demonstrate how vertex corrections play a central role in lowering the Higgs resonance with respect to the quasi-particle excitation gap in the spin-longitudinal susceptibility, yielding a well visible Higgs-mode.

Title: A Straightforward Gradient-Based Approach for High-Tc Superconductor Design: Leveraging Domain Knowledge via Adaptive Constraints
Authors: Akihiro Fujii, Anh Khoa Augustin Lu, Koji Shimizu, Satoshi Watanabe
Abstract: Materials design aims to discover novel compounds with desired properties. However, prevailing strategies face critical trade-offs. Conventional element-substitution approaches readily and adaptively incorporate various domain knowledge but remain confined to a narrow search space. In contrast, deep generative models efficiently explore vast compositional landscapes, yet they struggle to flexibly integrate domain knowledge. To address these trade-offs, we propose a gradient-based material design framework that combines these strengths, offering both efficiency and adaptability. In our method, chemical compositions are optimised to achieve target properties by using property prediction models and their gradients. In order to seamlessly enforce diverse constraints, including those reflecting domain insights such as oxidation states, discretised compositional ratios, types of elements, and their abundance, we apply masks and employ a special loss function, namely the integer loss. Furthermore, we initialise the optimisation using promising candidates from existing dataset, effectively guiding the search away from unfavourable regions and thus helping to avoid poor solutions. Our approach demonstrates a more efficient exploration of superconductor candidates, uncovering candidate materials with higher critical temperature than conventional element-substitution and generative models. Importantly, it could propose new compositions beyond those found in existing databases, including new hydride superconductors absent from the training dataset but which share compositional similarities with materials found in literature. This synergy of domain knowledge and machine-learning-based scalability provides a robust foundation for rapid, adaptive, and comprehensive materials design for superconductors and beyond.

Title: Non-Hermitian minimal Kitaev chains
Authors: Jorge Cayao, Ramón Aguado
Abstract: Starting from a double quantum dot realization of a minimal Kitaev chain, we demonstrate that non-Hermicity stabilizes the so-called poor man's Majorana zero modes in a region of parameter space that is much broader than in the Hermitian regime. In particular, we consider the simplest non-Hermitian mechanism which naturally appears due to coupling to normal reservoirs and is commonly present in all transport experiments. Specifically, such couplings induce exceptional points which connect stable and highly tunable zero energy real lines that are well separated from the quasicontinuum. Such zero-energy lines reflect spectral degeneracies protected by topology and represent the non-Hermitian generalization of the Hermitian poor mans Majorana modes occurring at single points in parameter space. Our findings pave the way for realizing robust non-Hermitian effects by combining unconventional superconductors and non-Hermitian topology.

Title: Entangled Photon-Pair Emission in Waveguide Circuit QED from a Cooper Pair Splitter
Authors: Michele Governale, Christian Schönenberger, Pasquale Scarlino, Gianluca Rastelli
Abstract: As a waveguide circuit QED architecture, we investigate theoretically the single-photon pair emission of a Cooper pair splitter composed of two double quantum dots, each coupled to a microwave transmission line. We find that this system can generate frequency-entangled photon pairs in the left and right transmission lines, specifically a superposition of two photon wave packets at different frequencies. The frequency entanglement of the two photons arises from the particle-hole coherent superposition (i.e., Andreev bound states) involving the delocalized entangled spin singlet. We also estimate a lower bound for the efficiency of entangled photon-pair generation, accounting for the presence of nonradiative processes such as phonon emissions. Our proposal is realistic and achievable with state-of-the-art techniques in quantum microwave engineering with electostatically defined semiconducting quantum dots.

Abstract: A new semi-analytic model of the metal rolling process is introduced, which, for the first time, is able to predict the through-thickness stress and strain oscillations present in long thin roll-gaps. The model is based on multiple-scales asymptotics, assuming a long thin roll-gap and a comparably small Coulomb friction coefficient. The leading-order solution varies only on a long lengthscale corresponding to the roll-gap length and matches with slab models. The next-order correction varies on both this long lengthscale and a short lengthscale associated with the workpiece thickness, and reveals rapid stress and strain oscillation both in the rolling direction and through the thickness. For this initial derivation, the model assumes a rigid perfectly-plastic material behaviour. Despite these strong assumptions, this model compares well with finite element simulations that employ more realistic material behaviour (including elasticity and strain hardening). These assumptions facilitate the simplest possible model to provide a foundational understanding of the complex through-thickness behaviour observed in the finite element simulations, while requiring an order of only seconds to compute. This model can form the foundation of further improved models with more complicated mechanics in the future. Matlab code for evaluating the model is provided in the supplementary material.

Title: Phantom chain simulations for fracture of star polymer networks on the effect of arm molecular weight
Authors: Yuichi Masubuchi
Abstract: This study investigated the fracture of star polymer networks made from prepolymers with various arm molecular weights in the range $2 \leq N_a \leq 0$, for node functionalities $3 \leq f \leq 8$ and conversion ratios $0.6\leq\phi_c\leq0.95$ by phantom chain simulations. The networks were created via end-linking reactions of star polymers dispersed in a simulation box with a fixed monomer density $\rho=8$. The resultant networks were alternatively subjected to energy minimization and uniaxial stretch until the break. The stretch at the break, $\lambda_b$, depended on the strand molecular weight $N_s=2N_a+1$ with a power-law manner described as $\lambda_b \sim N_s^0.67$, consistent with the experiment. However, the strand length before stretch is proportional to $N_s^0.5$, which does not explain the observed N_s-dependence of $\lambda_b$. The analysis based on the non-affine deformation theory does not interpret the phenomenon either. Instead, the increase of normalized prepolymer concentration concerning the overlapping concentration with increasing $N_s$ explains the result through a rise in the fraction of broken strands.

Title: Dirac points and topological phases in correlated altermagnets
Authors: Lorenzo Del Re
Abstract: We explore a two-dimensional Hubbard model adapted to host altermagnetic states. Utilizing Hartree-Fock (HF) and dynamical mean field theory (DMFT), we uncover that the magnetic solutions of this model feature Dirac points in their spectrum. HF predicts a gap opening at a critical interaction strength, a result corroborated by DMFT calculations at zero temperature. However, at finite temperature and high interaction strengths, Dirac points re-emerge at high energies in the spectral function, even if they are absent in the non-interacting and HF-predicted band structures. Analytical arguments reveal that this phenomenon arises near Mott insulating solutions from the frequency dependence of the self-energy, a behavior not captured by static mean-field theory. We identify distinctive dynamical signatures of correlated altermagnetic states in the spin-resolved optical conductivity, notably a double-peak structure likely linked to high-energy Dirac cone-like bands. Moreover, the spin-resolved response exhibits spin-selective activation at different photon energies, pointing to potential applications in spin-dependent optical control. We also propose perturbations to the model that can induce a topological gap in the spectrum, leading to a transition from topologically trivial to non-trivial states by varying doping, interaction strength, and temperature.

Title: Umklapp-driven first-order transition into a charge-density wave phase
Authors: A.V. Rozhkov
Abstract: Using phenomenological Landau free energy, we systematically analyze influence of so-called umklapp contributions on the phase diagram of a solid hosting a commensurate charge-density wave phase. The umklapp terms may change the transition into the ordered state from continuous (second-order) to discontinuous (first-order). Additional elements, such as critical and tricritical points, emerge on the phase diagram under suitable conditions. The proposed mechanism is generalized for the case of nearly-commensurate charge-density wave, as well as spin-density wave orders. Several charge-density-wave-hosting alloys are used as experimentally available examples illustrating the formalism.

Title: Improper flexoelectricity in hexagonal rare-earth ferrites
Authors: Xin Li, Guodong Ren, Yu Yun, Arashdeep Singh Thind, Amit Kumar Shah, Abbey Bowers, Rohan Mishra, Xiaoshan Xu
Abstract: Flexoelectricity is a universal effect that generates electric polarization due to broken inversion symmetry caused by local strain gradient. The large strain gradient at nanoscale makes flexo-electric effects, especially in nanoscopic ferroelectric materials, promising in sensors, actuator, energy harvesting, and memory applications. In this work, we studied flexoelectricity in hexagonal ferrites h-YbFeO3, an improper ferroelectric expected to have weak piezoelectricity and low sensitivity to depolarization field, which are advantageous for studying flexoelectric effects. We show that in h-YbFeO3 epitaxial thin films, strain gradient on the order of 10^6 m-1 occurs near grain boundaries and edge dislocation, which has a significant impact on the non-polar K3 structural distortion that induces spontaneous polarization. The phenomenological model based on the Landau theory of improper ferroelectricity suggests an indirect flexoelectric effect on the order of 10 nC/m in h-YbFeO3, which is substantially larger than the expectation from Kogan mechanism. These results reveal a novel microscopic mechanism of coupling between strain gradient and polarization mediated by structural distortion, which we call improper flexoelectricity.

Title: Rethinking Gradient-Based Methods: Multi-Property Materials Design Beyond Differentiable Targets
Authors: Akihiro Fujii, Yoshitaka Ushiku, Koji Shimizu, Anh Khoa Augustin Lu, Satoshi Watanabe
Abstract: Gradient-based methods offer a simple, efficient strategy for materials design by directly optimizing candidates using gradients from pretrained property predictors. However, their use in crystal structure optimization is hindered by two key challenges: handling non-differentiable constraints, such as charge neutrality and structural fidelity, and susceptibility to poor local minima. We revisit and extend the gradient-based methods to address these issues. We propose Simultaneous Multi-property Optimization using Adaptive Crystal Synthesizer (SMOACS), which integrates oxidation-number masks and template-based initialization to enforce non-differentiable constraints, avoid poor local minima, and flexibly incorporate additional constraints without retraining. SMOACS enables multi-property optimization. including exceptional targets such as high-temperature superconductivity, and scales to large crystal systems, both persistent challenges for generative models, even those enhanced with gradient-based guidance from property predictors. In experiments on five target properties and three datasets, SMOACS outperforms generative models and Bayesian optimization methods, successfully designing 135-atom perovskite structures that satisfy multiple property targets and constraints, a task at which the other methods fail entirely.

Title: Revealing Fano Resonance in Dirac Materials ZrTe5 through Raman Scattering
Authors: Di Cheng, Tao Jiang, Feng Zhang, Genda Gu, Liang Luo, Chuankun Huang, Boqun Song, Martin Mootz, Avinash Khatri, Joong-Mok Park, Qiang Li, Yongxin Yao, Jigang Wang
Abstract: We explore the Fano resonance in ZrTe5, using Raman scattering measurements. We identified two closely spaced B2g phonon modes, B2g I and B2g II, around 9 meV and 10 meV, respectively. Interestingly, only B2g I exhibited the Fano resonance, an outcome of quantum interference between discrete phonon modes and continuous electronic excitations. This is consistent with the much stronger electron-phonon coupling of B2g I mode demonstrated by first-principles calculations. Additionally, temperature-dependent measurements highlight an enhanced Fano asymmetry at elevated temperatures, contributed by the thermal renormalization of the band structure and electron-phonon coupling. This study offers insights into the complex interrelation of electron-phonon coupling, thermal effects, and Fano resonances in ZrTe5.

Title: Emergent Weyl-like points in periodically modulated systems and Floquet engineering
Authors: Fang Qin, Rui Chen
Abstract: We investigate a three-dimensional (3D) topological phase resembling a Weyl semimetal, modulated by a periodic potential and engineered through Floquet dynamics. This system is constructed by stacking two-dimensional Chern insulators and hosts Weyl-like points defined in the parameter space $(k_x, k_y, z)$, distinct from conventional Weyl points in momentum space $(k_x, k_y, k_z)$. The Weyl-semimetal-like phase exhibits characteristics akin to those of Weyl semimetals, including linear dispersion near the Weyl-like points, nontrivial bulk topology, and the presence of Fermi arcs connecting the Weyl-like points. Unlike traditional Weyl semimetals, these features manifest in real space rather than momentum space. Furthermore, we calculate the local density of states, the layer Hall conductance, and the total 3D Hall conductivity, demonstrating that the Weyl-semimetal-like phase remains stable under weak and moderate interlayer couplings. Finally, we compute the Floquet Chern number and show that the positions of the Weyl-like points can be tuned via high-frequency laser pumping.

Title: Thermodynamic Favorability of the 1T Phase over the 1H Phase in Group III Metal Monochalcogenide Zigzag Nanoribbons
Authors: Emin Aliyev, Arash Mobaraki, Hâldun Sevinçli, Seymur Jahangirov
Abstract: Owing to the promising optoelectronic and thermoelectric properties of two-dimensional (2D) group III-VI materials (MXs), their nanoribbons (NRs) have attracted notable attention as an emerging class of quasi-one-dimensional (quasi-1D) nanostructures. Due to the fact that the most stable 2D monolayer polymorph of MXs is the 1H phase, to date, existing studies in the literature have predominantly focused on the NRs formed from 1H phase MXs. Nevertheless, NRs of the 1T phase have received little to no attention. Employing ab initio simulations based on density functional theory, we systematically compared the thermodynamic stability of hydrogen passivated and unpassivated 1T and 1H ZNRs of GaS, GaSe, and InSe. Our results reveal that non-polar 1T phase MX ZNRs are thermodynamically more favorable than polar 1H MX ZNRs at widths up to 34 nm, a range that is realizable through contemporary experimental fabrication techniques. Furthermore, unlike metallic 1H ZNRs, 1T ZNRs remain semiconductor and retain a Mexican-hat-shaped top valence bands. Complementarily, hydrogenation energies of 1T InSe ZNRs are positive, and due to the edge-localized states, the 1T unpassivated ZNRs possess nearly flat top valence bands. Our findings serve as a compass for subsequent synthesis pathways of group III-VI NRs.

Title: The XY model with vision cone: non-reciprocal vs. reciprocal interactions
Authors: Gabriele Bandini, Davide Venturelli, Sarah A. M. Loos, Asja Jelic, Andrea Gambassi
Abstract: We study the behavior of the classical XY model on a two-dimensional square lattice, with interactions occurring within a vision cone of each spin. Via Monte Carlo simulations, we explore one non-reciprocal and two reciprocal implementations of these interactions. The corresponding energy involves couplings that depend non-trivially on the system's configuration, leading to both long-range and quasi-long-range ordered phases at low temperatures. Our results demonstrate that non-reciprocity is not essential for achieving long-range order at low temperatures. Using symmetry arguments, we provide a theoretical framework to explain these findings, and additionally we uncover an unexpected order-by-disorder transition.

Title: Microscopic theory of pair density waves in spin-orbit coupled Kondo lattice
Authors: Aaditya Panigrahi, Alexei Tsvelik, Piers Coleman
Abstract: We demonstrate that the discommensuration between the Fermi surfaces of a conduction sea and an underlying spin liquid provides a natural mechanism for the spontaneous formation of pair density waves. Using a recent formulation of the Kondo lattice model which incorporates a Yao Lee spin liquid proposed by the authors, we demonstrate that doping away from half-filling induces finite-momentum electron-Majorana pair condensation, resulting in amplitude-modulated PDWs. Our approach provides a precise, analytically tractable pathway for understanding the spontaneous formation of PDWs in higher dimensions and offers a natural mechanism for PDW formation in the absence of a Zeeman field.

Title: Thermal Annealing and Radiation Effects on Structural and Electrical Properties of NbN/GaN Superconductor/Semiconductor Junction
Authors: Stephen Margiotta, Binzhi Liu, Saleh Ahmed Khan, Gabriel Calderon Ortiz, Ahmed Ibreljic, Jinwoo Hwang, A F M Anhar Uddin Bhuiyan
Abstract: In the rapidly evolving field of quantum computing, niobium nitride (NbN) superconductors have emerged as integral components due to their unique structural properties, including a high superconducting transition temperature (Tc), exceptional electrical conductivity, and compatibility with advanced device architectures. This study investigates the impact of high-temperature annealing and high-dose gamma irradiation on the structural and superconducting properties of NbN films grown on GaN via reactive DC magnetron sputtering. The as-deposited cubic {\delta}-NbN (111) films exhibited a high-intensity XRD peak, high Tc of 12.82K, and an atomically flat surface. Annealing at 500 and 950 °C for varying durations revealed notable structural and surface changes. High-resolution STEM indicated improved local ordering, while AFM showed reduced surface roughness after annealing. XPS revealed a gradual increase in the Nb/N ratio with higher annealing temperatures and durations. High-resolution XRD and STEM analyses showed lattice constant modifications in {\delta}-NbN films, attributed to residual stress changes following annealing. Additionally, XRD phi-scans revealed sixfold symmetry in NbN films due to rotational domains relative to GaN. While Tc remained stable after annealing at 500 °C, increasing the annealing temperature to 950 °C degraded Tc to ~8K and reduced the residual resistivity ratio from 0.85 in as-deposited films to 0.29 after 30 minutes. The effects of gamma radiation (5 Mrad (Si)) were also studied, demonstrating minimal changes to crystallinity and superconducting performance, indicating excellent radiation resilience. These findings highlight the potential of NbN superconductors for integration into advanced quantum devices and their suitability for applications in radiation-intensive environments such as space, satellites, and nuclear power plants.

Title: Eigenstate thermalization to non-monotonic distributions in strongly-interacting chaotic lattice gases
Authors: Vladimir A. Yurovsky (School of Chemistry, Tel Aviv University), Amichay Vardi (Department of Chemistry, Ben-Gurion University and ITAMP, Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics)
Abstract: We find non-monotonic equilibrium energy distributions, qualitatively different from the Fermi-Dirac and Bose-Einstein forms, in strongly-interacting many-body chaotic systems. The effect emerges in systems with finite energy spectra, supporting both positive and negative temperatures, in the regime of quantum ergodicity. The results are supported by exact diagonalization calculations for chaotic Fermi-Hubbard and Bose-Hubbard models, when they have Wigner-Dyson statistics of energy spectra and demonstrate eigenstate thermalization. The proposed effects may be observed in experiments with cold atoms in optical lattices.

Title: Diagonal superexchange in a simple square CuO$_2$ lattice
Authors: V. A. Gavrichkov, S. I. Polukeev, S. G. Ovchinnikov
Abstract: Many microscopic models with the interaction between the next-nearest neighbours as a key parameter for cuprate physics have inspired us to study the diagonal superexchange interaction in a CuO$_2$ layer. Our investigation shows that models with extended hopping provide a correct representation of magnetic interactions only in a hypothetical square CuO$_2$ layer, where the diagonal superexchange interaction with the next-nearest neighbors always has the AFM nature. The conclusions are based on the symmetry prohibition on FM contribution to the diagonal superexchange between the next-nearest neighbors for a simple square CuO$_2$ layer rather than for a real CuO$_2$ layer, where diagonal AFM superexchange may be overestimated. We also discuss the reasons for magnetic frustration effects and high sensitivity of spin nanoinhomogeneity to square symmetry breaking.

Title: Navigating chemical design spaces for metal-ion batteries via machine-learning-guided phase-field simulations
Authors: Hamed Taghavian, Viktor Vanoppen, Erik Berg, Peter Broqvist, Jens Sjölund
Abstract: Metal anodes provide the highest energy density in batteries. However, they still suffer from electrode/electrolyte interface side reactions and dendrite growth, especially under fast-charging conditions. In this paper, we consider a phase-field model of electrodeposition in metal-anode batteries and provide a scalable, versatile framework for optimizing its chemical parameters. Our approach is based on Bayesian optimization and explores the parameter space with a high sample efficiency and a low computation complexity. We use this framework to find the optimal cell for suppressing dendrite growth and accelerating charging speed under constant voltage. We identify interfacial mobility as a key parameter, which should be maximized to inhibit dendrites without compromising the charging speed. The results are verified using extended simulations of dendrite evolution in charging half cells with lithium-metal anodes.

Title: The Saga of $α$-RuCl$_3$: Parameters, Models, and Phase Diagrams
Authors: Marius Möller, P. A. Maksimov, Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White, Roser Valenti, A. L. Chernyshev
Abstract: RuCl$_3$ was likely the first ever deliberately synthesized ruthenium compound, following the discovery of the $_{44}$Ru element in 1844. For a long time it was known as an oxidation catalyst, with its physical properties being discrepant and confusing, until a decade ago when its allotropic form $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ rose to exceptional prominence. This "re-discovery" of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has not only reshaped the hunt for a material manifestation of the Kitaev spin liquid, but it has opened the floodgates of theoretical and experimental research in the many unusual phases and excitations that the anisotropic-exchange magnets as a class of compounds have to offer. Given its importance for the field of Kitaev materials, it is astonishing that the low-energy spin model that describes this compound and its possible proximity to the much-desired spin-liquid state is still a subject of significant debate ten years later. In the present study, we argue that the existing key phenomenological observations put strong natural constraints on the effective microscopic spin model of $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$, and specifically on its spin-orbit-induced anisotropic-exchange parameters that are responsible for the non-trivial physical properties of this material. These constraints allow one to focus on the relevant region of the multi-dimensional phase diagram of the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ model, suggest an intuitive description of it via a different parametrization of the exchange matrix, offer a unifying view on the earlier assessments of its parameters, and bring closer together several approaches to the derivation of anisotropic-exchange models. We explore extended phase diagrams relevant to the $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ parameter space using quasi-classical, Luttinger-Tisza, exact diagonalization, and density-matrix renormalization group methods, demonstrating a remarkably c...

Title: Metal-to-superconductor Transition Induced by Lithium Adsorption on Monolayer 1$T$-Nb$_2$C
Authors: Lingxiao Xiong, Yuhui Yan, Feipeng Zheng
Abstract: Recently, two-dimensional Nb$_2$C has garnered increasing attention due to its functional-group-dependent superconductivity, both experimentally and theoretically. In contrast to the halogen and chalcogen additives that have been the main focus of previous studies, we study the effect of lithium adsorption, which can also be incorporated during the synthesis of Nb$_2$C. Our computational analysis reveals a metal-to-superconductor transition in monolayer Nb$_2$C with a critical temperature ($T_{\mathrm{c}}$) of 22.1 K and a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution following the adsorption of lithium atoms. This emergent superconductivity is attributed to the increased electronic states at the Fermi energy, resulting from the contribution of Nb-$d$ orbitals and electron gas states induced by the low electronegativity of lithium. Furthermore, the application of tensile strain raises the $T_{\mathrm{c}}$ to 24 K, which is higher than that of most functional-group-modified Nb$_2$C systems. Our work deepens the understanding of electron-phonon coupling in layered Nb$_2$C, and provides new insights into achieving high critical temperature superconductivity with a strong anisotropic superconducting gap distribution in this system.

Title: Charge Orders in Fully Intercalated Bilayer TaSe$_2$: Dependence on Interlayer Stacking and Intercalation Sites
Authors: Yuhui Yan, Lingxiao Xiong, Feipeng Zheng
Abstract: Recent advancements have established self-intercalation as a powerful technique for manipulating quantum material properties, with precisely controllable intercalation concentrations. Given the inherently rich phase diagrams of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), studying the self-intercalated TMDCs can offer promising candidates for investigating the interplay between various orderings. This work focuses on fully intercalated bilayer TaSe$_2$ (Ta$_3$Se$_4$), which has recently been fabricated experimentally. By performing first-principles calculations, we demonstrate the suppression of an intrinsic $3\times3$ charge density wave (CDW) in parent TaSe$_2$ layers, and the emergence of $2\times 2$, $\sqrt{3} \times \sqrt{3}$, or the absence of a CDW in the intercalated layers, depending on the interlayer stacking orders and intercalation sites being occupied. Particularly, the $2\times 2$ CDW shows an increase in electronic states at the Fermi level compared to its non-CDW phase. This unusual behavior contrasts with that of typical CDW materials in TMDCs. Furthermore, superconductivity is preserved in these Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures, with superconducting transition temperatures comparable to or substantially smaller than those of TaSe$_2$. Spin-orbit coupling is found to enhance the density of states at Fermi levels while simultaneously reducing the electron-phonon coupling matrix elements. These two competing effects result in varying impacts on superconductivity across different Ta$_3$Se$_4$ structures. Moreover, our calculations indicate that magnetic order is absent. Our study deepens the understanding of underlying physics in Ta$_3$Se$_4$, and provides experimentally feasible candidates for studying CDW, superconductivity, and their interplay.

Title: Field Dislocation Mechanics, Conservation of Burgers vector, and the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics
Authors: Amit Acharya
Abstract: Dissipative models for the quasi-static and dynamic response due to slip in an elastic body containing a single slip plane of vanishing thickness are developed. Discrete dislocations with continuously distributed cores can glide on this plane, and the models are developed as special cases of a fully three-dimensional theory of plasticity induced by dislocation motion. The reduced models are compared and contrasted with the augmented Peierls model of dislocation dynamics. A primary distinguishing feature of the reduced models is the a-priori accounting of space-time conservation of Burgers vector during dislocation evolution. A physical shortcoming of the developed models as well as the Peierls model with regard to a dependence on the choice of a distinguished, coherent reference configuration is discussed, and a testable model without such dependence is also proposed.

Title: Renormalized mechanics and stochastic thermodynamics of growing vesicles
Authors: Jordan L. Shivers, Michael Nguyen, Aaron R. Dinner, Petia Vlahovska, Suriyanarayanan Vaikuntanathan
Abstract: Uncovering the rules governing the nonequilibrium dynamics of the membranes that define biological cells is of central importance to understanding the physics of living systems. We theoretically and computationally investigate the behavior of flexible quasispherical vesicles that exchange membrane constituents, internal volume, and heat with an external reservoir. The excess chemical potential and osmotic pressure difference imposed by the reservoir act as generalized thermodynamic driving forces that modulate vesicle morphology. We show that the renormalization of membrane mechanical properties by nonequilibrium driving gives rise to a morphological transition between a weakly driven regime, in which growing vesicles remain quasispherical, and a strongly driven regime, in which vesicles accommodate rapid membrane uptake by developing surface wrinkles. Additionally, we propose a minimal vesicle growth-shape law, derived using insights from stochastic thermodynamics, that robustly describes vesicle growth dynamics even in strongly driven, far-from-equilibrium regimes.

Title: The fundamental localization phases in quasiperiodic systems: A unified framework and exact results
Authors: Xin-Chi Zhou, Bing-Chen Yao, Yongjian Wang, Yucheng Wang, Yudong Wei, Qi Zhou, Xiong-Jun Liu
Abstract: The disordered quantum systems host three types of quantum states, the extended, localized, and critical, which bring up seven distinct fundamental phases in nature: three pure phases and four coexisting ones with mobility edges, yet a unified theory with full characterization and realization of all these phases has not been developed. Here we propose a complete and unified framework based on a spinful quasiperiodic (QP) system which realizes all the fundamental localization phases, with the exact and universal results being obtained for their characterization. First, we show that the pure phases are obtained when the chiral symmetry preserves in the proposed spinful QP model, giving a criterion for the emergence of the pure phases and otherwise the coexisting ones. Further, we uncover a novel universal mechanism for the critical states that their emergence is protected by the generalized incommensurate matrix element zeros in the spinful QP model, which considerably broadens the rigorous realizations of the exotic critical states. We then show the criteria of exact solvability for the present spinful QP system, with which we construct various exactly solvable models for all distinct localization phases. In particular, we propose two novel models, dubbed spin-selective QP lattice model and QP optical Raman lattice model, to achieve all basic types of mobility edges and all the seven fundamental phases of Anderson localization physics, respectively. The experimental scheme is proposed and studied in detail to realize these models with high feasibility. This study establishes a complete and profound theoretical framework which enables an in-depth exploration of the broad classes of all fundamental localization phenomena in QP systems, and offers key insights for constructing their exactly solvable models with experimental feasibility.

Title: Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities
Authors: Christoph Haessig, Mehdi Habibi, Uddalok Sen
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.

Title: Regional chemical potential analysis for material surfaces
Authors: Masahiro Fukuda, Masato Senami, Yoshiaki Sugimoto, Taisuke Ozaki
Abstract: We propose a local regional chemical potential (RCP) analysis method based on an energy window scheme to quantitatively estimate the selectivity of atomic and molecular adsorption on surfaces, as well as the strength of chemical bonding forces between a probe tip and a surface in atomic force microscopy (AFM) measurements. In particular, focusing on the local picture of covalent bonding, we use a simple H$_2$ molecular model to demonstrate a clear relationship between chemical bonding forces and the local RCP. Moreover, density functional theory calculations on molecular systems and diamond C(001) surfaces reveal that the local RCP at the surfaces successfully visualizes electron-donating regions such as dangling bonds and double bonds. These results suggest that the local RCP can serve as an effective measure to analyze high-resolution non-contact or near-contact AFM images enhanced by chemical bonding forces.

Title: Ballistic-to-diffusive transition in engineered counter-propagating quantum Hall channels
Authors: Aifei Zhang, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Patrice Roche, Carles Altimiras, François D. Parmentier, Olivier Maillet
Abstract: Exotic quantum Hall systems hosting counter-propagating edge states can show seemingly non-universal transport regimes, usually depending on the size of the sample. We experimentally probe transport in a quantum Hall sample engineered to host a tunable number of counter-propagating edge states. The latter are coupled by Landauer reservoirs, which force charge equilibration over a tunable effective length. We show that charge transport is determined by the balance of up- and downstream channels, with a ballistic regime emerging for unequal numbers of channels. For equal numbers, we observe a transition to a critical diffusive regime, characterized by a diverging equilibration length. Our approach allows simulating the equilibration of hole-conjugate states and other exotic quantum Hall effects with fully controlled parameters using well-understood quantum Hall states.

Title: Modelling of time-dependent electrostatic effects and AFM-based surface conductivity characterization
Authors: Mario Navarro-Rodriguez, Paul Philip Schmidt, Regina Hoffmann-Vogel, Andres M. Somoza, Elisa Palacios-Lidon
Abstract: Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) combined with electrical modes provides a powerful contactless approach to characterize material electrical properties at the nanoscale. However, conventional electrostatic models often overlook dynamic charge effects, which are particularly relevant for 2D materials deposited on insulating substrates. In this work, we introduce a theoretical framework that extends traditional electrostatic models by incorporating charge dynamics, analyzing two key cases: quasi-ideal conductors and quasi-ideal insulators. Our model establishes a characteristic timescale, $\tau$, which governs charge redistribution and measurement reliability. Experimental validation using Graphene Oxide, Reduced Graphene Oxide, and lightly reduced GO demonstrates strong dependence of frequency shift on surface conductivity, confirming our predictions. Temperature-dependent measurements further reveal conductivity variations consistent with disordered electronic materials. These findings provide critical insight into the impact of finite surface conductivity on AFM-based techniques and establish a novel method for evaluating charge dynamics in individual flakes of 2D materials and propose an alternative, contactless method for estimating surface conductivity.

Title: Learned Free-Energy Functionals from Pair-Correlation Matching for Dynamical Density Functional Theory
Authors: Karnik Ram, Jacobus Dijkman, René van Roij, Jan-Willem van de Meent, Bernd Ensing, Max Welling, Daniel Cremers
Abstract: Classical density functional theory (cDFT) and dynamical density functional theory (DDFT) are modern statistical mechanical theories for modeling many-body colloidal systems at the one-body density level. The theories hinge on knowing the excess free-energy accurately, which is however not feasible for most practical applications. Dijkman et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 134, 056103 (2025)] recently showed how a neural excess free-energy functional for cDFT can be learned from bulk simulations via pair-correlation matching. In this article, we demonstrate how this same functional can be applied to DDFT, without any retraining, to simulate non-equilibrium overdamped dynamics of inhomogeneous densities. We evaluate this on a 3D Lennard-Jones system with planar geometry under various complex external potentials and observe good agreement of the dynamical densities with those from expensive Brownian dynamic simulations, up to the limit of the adiabatic approximation. We further develop and apply an extension of DDFT based on gradient flows, to a grand-canonical system modeled after breakthrough gas adsorption studies, finding similarly good agreement. Our results demonstrate a practical route for leveraging learned free-energy functionals in DDFT, paving the way for accurate and efficient modeling of many-body non-equilibrium systems.

Title: Simultaneous probes of pseudogap and disorder by hard x-ray photoemission applied for a candidate thermoelectric Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal
Authors: N. U. Sakamoto, G. Nozue, H. Fujiwara, Y. Torii, M. Sakaguchi, T. D. Nakamura, T. Kiss, H. Sugawara, S. Tanaka, Y. Iwasaki, Y. Niwa, A. Ishikawa, T. D. Yamamoto, R. Tamura, A. Yasui, A. Sekiyama
Abstract: The bulk electronic structure of Al-Pd-Ru quasicrystal (QC) have been investigated by hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). We have found an intrinsic pseudogap structure in which the spectral weight in the vicinity of the Fermi level (E_F) is remarkably suppressed at any photon energy. The valence-band HAXPES spectra and the asymmetry of the core-level peaks indicate a contribution of the Al sites to the electronic structure in the vicinity of E_F with less contributions from the Pd and Ru sites. The disorder effects are found in the core-level lineshapes of the Al-Pd-Ru QC, of which the widths are much broader than those of the other reference crystalline solids with less disorder.

Title: Influence of microscopic parameters on phase behavior of a cell model with Curie-Weiss interaction
Authors: O.A. Dobush, M.P. Kozlovskii, I.V. Pylyuk, Yu.O. Plevachuk
Abstract: We investigate how varying two microscopic parameters - cell volume and the ratio between repulsion and attraction intensities - affect the phase behavior of a cell model with a Curie-Weiss-type interaction. The analysis is based on an exact solution previously derived for this model in the grand canonical ensemble. At sufficiently low temperatures, the cell model exhibits multiple first-order phase transitions. By varying the cell volume and the repulsion-to-attraction ratio, we represent a quantitative comparison of the chemical potential and pressure isotherms, along with the pressure-temperature and temperature-density phase diagrams. Our results demonstrate that altering these microscopic parameters induces quantitative changes in the phase diagrams of the cell model.

Abstract: Many-body localization (MBL) transition emerges at strong disorder in interacting systems, separating chaotic and reversible dynamics. Although the existence of MBL transition within the macroscopic limit in spin chains with a short-range interaction was proved rigorously, the transition point is not found yet because of the dramatic sensitivity of the transition point to the chain length at computationally accessible lengths, possible due to local fluctuations destroying localization. Here we investigate MBL transition in the quantum Ising model (Ising model in a transverse field) with the long-range interaction suppressing the fluctuations similarly to that for the second-order phase transitions. We estimate the MBL threshold within the logarithmic accuracy using exact results for a somewhat similar localization problem on a Bethe lattice problem and show that our expectations are fully consistent with the estimate of the transition point using exact diagonalization. In spite of unlimited growing of the critical disorder within the thermodynamic limit, this result offers the opportunity to probe the critical behavior of the system near the transition point. Moreover, the model is relevant for the wide variety of physical systems with the long-range dipole-dipole, elastic or indirect exchange interactions.

Title: Sr$_2$NbO$_4$: A $4d$ analogue of the layered perovskite Sr$_2$VO$_4$
Authors: Leonid S. Taran, Anastasia E. Lebedeva, Sergey V. Streltsov
Abstract: This work focuses on the layered perovskite Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, a 4$d$ analogue of Sr$_2$VO$_4$, which remains an unsolved puzzle with a possible intriguing hidden magnetic order. Using density functional theory (DFT) calculations, we demonstrate the robust thermodynamic stability and exfoliability of Sr$_2$NbO$_4$, suggesting potential applications as a 2D material. Imperfect Fermi surface nesting indicates instabilities that may drive symmetry lowering, charge/orbital density waves, or superconductivity. Dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) calculations reveal moderate mass renormalization $(m^*/m\sim1.3)$ and an itinerant character of magnetism with strong longitudinal spin fluctuations. The exchange interaction is dominated by in-plane ferromagnetic coupling with much weaker interlayer antiferromagnetic exchange.

Title: Critical and Nonpercolating Phases in Bond Percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse Network
Authors: Kazuki Wataya, Takehisa Hasegawa
Abstract: We investigate bond percolation on the Song-Havlin-Makse (SHM) network, a scale-free tree with a tunable degree exponent and dimensionality. Using a generating function approach, we analytically derive the average size and the fractal exponent of the root cluster for deterministic cases. Our analysis reveals that bond percolation on the SHM network remains in a nonpercolating phase for all $p < 1$ when the network is fractal (i.e., finite-dimensional), whereas it exhibits a critical phase, where the cluster size distribution follows a power-law with a $p$-dependent exponent, throughout the entire range of $p$ when the network is small-world (i.e., infinite-dimensional), regardless of the specific dimensionality or degree exponent. The analytical results are in excellent agreement with Monte Carlo simulations.

Title: Enantiosensitive locking of photoelectron spin and cation orientation
Authors: Philip Caesar M. Flores, Stefanos Carlström, Serguei Patchkovskii, Andres F. Ordonez, Olga Smirnova
Abstract: When electrons pass through chiral molecules, their transmission is strongly influenced by the orientation of their spin: molecules with opposite handedness preferentially transmit electrons with oppositely aligned spins. The underlying nature of this striking phenomenon, known as chirality-induced spin selectivity (CISS), remains controversial: its observed strength far surpasses predictions based on the typically weak spin-orbit interaction. A significant fraction of CISS phenomena are driven by light, and thus could be controlled at the ultrafast scale, and impact chemical change following photoionization or photoexcitation. To date, most studies of spin-selective enantio-sensitive photodynamics have concentrated on the influence of the magnetic field component of light. Here, we establish dynamical and geometric mechanisms of spin-selective photo-induced dynamics that arise purely from electric dipole interactions. Using one-photon ionization as an example, we report a new effect: enantio-sensitive locking of molecular cation orientation to the spins of the photoelectron and the hole in the parent molecule. One-photon ionization is an ubiquitous process, where CISS has already been found in oriented samples. Remarkably, the new effect that we report here emerges upon photoionization of randomly oriented chiral molecules, establishing CISS in amorphous chiral media.

Title: On the performance of machine-learning-assisted Monte Carlo in sampling from simple statistical physics models
Authors: Luca Maria Del Bono, Federico Ricci-Tersenghi, Francesco Zamponi
Abstract: Recent years have seen a rise in the application of machine learning techniques to aid the simulation of hard-to-sample systems that cannot be studied using traditional methods. Despite the introduction of many different architectures and procedures, a wide theoretical understanding is still lacking, with the risk of suboptimal implementations. As a first step to address this gap, we provide here a complete analytic study of the widely-used Sequential Tempering procedure applied to a shallow MADE architecture for the Curie-Weiss model. The contribution of this work is twofold: firstly, we give a description of the optimal weights and of the training under Gradient Descent optimization. Secondly, we compare what happens in Sequential Tempering with and without the addition of local Metropolis Monte Carlo steps. We are thus able to give theoretical predictions on the best procedure to apply in this case. This work establishes a clear theoretical basis for the integration of machine learning techniques into Monte Carlo sampling and optimization.

Title: Unveiling Eigenstate Thermalization for Non-Hermitian systems
Authors: Sudipto Singha Roy, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Ricardo Costa de Almeida, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: The eigenstate thermalization hypothesis (ETH) has been highly influential in explaining thermodynamic behavior of closed quantum systems. As of yet, it is unclear whether and how the ETH applies to non-Hermitian systems. Here, we introduce a framework that extends the ETH to non-Hermitian systems, within which expectation values of local operators reproduce statistical and scaling predictions known from Hermitian ETH. We illustrate the validity of the framework on non-Hermitian random-matrix and Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev models. Further, we show numerically how the static ETH predictions become imprinted onto the dynamics of local observables. Finally, we present a prescription for observing both ETH-obeying and ETH-violating regimes in an optical-lattice experiment that implements a disordered interacting Hatano-Nelson model. Our results generalize the celebrated ETH to the non-Hermitian setting, and they show how it affects the system dynamics, and how the salient signatures can be observed in present-day cold-atom experiments.

Title: A non-Hermitian loop for a quantum measurement
Authors: Luis E. F. Foa Torres, Stephan Roche
Abstract: Here we present a non-Hermitian framework for modeling state-vector collapse under unified dynamics described by Schrödinger's equation. Under the premise of non-Hermitian Hamiltonian dynamics, we argue that collapse has to occur when the Hamiltonian completes a closed loop in the parameter space encoding the interaction with the meter. For two-level systems, we put forward the phenomenon of chiral state conversion as a mechanism for effectively eliminating superpositions. This perspective opens a way to simulate quantum measurements in classical systems that up to now were restricted to the Schrödinger part of the quantum dynamics.

Title: Optimal Protocols for Continual Learning via Statistical Physics and Control Theory
Authors: Francesco Mori, Stefano Sarao Mannelli, Francesca Mignacco
Abstract: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the performance on previously learned tasks. Recent theoretical work has addressed this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this paper, we fill this gap by combining exact equations for training dynamics, derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols modulate established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting. Finally, we validate our theoretical findings with experiments on real-world data.

Title: A gradient flow perspective on McKean-Vlasov equations in econophysics
Authors: David W. Cohen
Abstract: We prove that the Gini coefficient of economic inequality is a Lyapunov functional for a class of nonlinear, nonlocal integro-differential equations arising at the intersection of mathematics, economics, and statistical physics. Next, a novel Riemannian geometry is imposed on a subset of probability densities such that the evolutionary dynamics are formally driven by the Gini coefficient functional as a gradient flow. Thus in the same way that classical 2-Wasserstein theory connects heat flow and the Second Law of Thermodynamics by way of Boltzmann entropy, the work here gives rise to a principle of econophysics that is much of the same flavor but for the Gini coefficient. The noncanonical Onsager operators associated to the metric tensors are derived and some transport inequalities proven. The new metric relates to the dual norm of a second-order Sobolev-like factor space, in a similar way to how the classical 2-Wasserstein metric linearizes as the dual norm of a first-order, homogeneous Sobolev space.

Title: Chiral Dissociation of Bound Photon Pairs for a Non-Hermitian Skin Effect
Authors: Jiaming Shi, Alexander N. Poddubny
Abstract: We theoretically study the bound states of interacting photons propagating in a waveguide chirally coupled to an array of atoms. We demonstrate that the bound photon pairs can concentrate at the edge of the array and link this to the non-Hermitian skin effect. Unlike tight-binding non-Hermitian setups, the bound states in the waveguide-coupled array exhibit infinite radiative lifetimes when the array has an infinite size. However, in a finite array, non-Hermiticity and localization of bound pairs emerge due to their chiral dissociation into scattering states. Counterintuitively, when the photons are preferentially emitted to the right, the bound pairs are localized at the left edge of the array and vice versa.

Title: Survival of the fastest -- algorithm-guided evolution of light-powered underwater microrobots
Authors: Mikołaj Rogóż, Zofia Dziekan, Piotr Wasylczyk
Abstract: Depending on multiple parameters, soft robots can exhibit different modes of locomotion that are difficult to model numerically. As a result, improving their performance is complex, especially in small-scale systems characterized by low Reynolds numbers, when multiple aero- and hydrodynamical processes influence their movement. In this work, we optimize light-powered millimetre-scale underwater swimmer locomotion by applying experimental results - measured swimming speed - as the fitness function in two evolutionary algorithms: particle swarm optimization and genetic algorithm. As these soft, light-powered robots with different characteristics (phenotypes) can be fabricated quickly, they provide a great platform for optimisation experiments, using many competing robots to improve swimming speed over consecutive generations. Interestingly, just like in natural evolution, unexpected gene combinations led to surprisingly good results, including eight-fold increase in speed or the discovery of a self-oscillating underwater locomotion mode.

Title: Understanding and Mitigating Distribution Shifts For Machine Learning Force Fields
Authors: Tobias Kreiman, Aditi S. Krishnapriyan
Abstract: Machine Learning Force Fields (MLFFs) are a promising alternative to expensive ab initio quantum mechanical molecular simulations. Given the diversity of chemical spaces that are of interest and the cost of generating new data, it is important to understand how MLFFs generalize beyond their training distributions. In order to characterize and better understand distribution shifts in MLFFs, we conduct diagnostic experiments on chemical datasets, revealing common shifts that pose significant challenges, even for large foundation models trained on extensive data. Based on these observations, we hypothesize that current supervised training methods inadequately regularize MLFFs, resulting in overfitting and learning poor representations of out-of-distribution systems. We then propose two new methods as initial steps for mitigating distribution shifts for MLFFs. Our methods focus on test-time refinement strategies that incur minimal computational cost and do not use expensive ab initio reference labels. The first strategy, based on spectral graph theory, modifies the edges of test graphs to align with graph structures seen during training. Our second strategy improves representations for out-of-distribution systems at test-time by taking gradient steps using an auxiliary objective, such as a cheap physical prior. Our test-time refinement strategies significantly reduce errors on out-of-distribution systems, suggesting that MLFFs are capable of and can move towards modeling diverse chemical spaces, but are not being effectively trained to do so. Our experiments establish clear benchmarks for evaluating the generalization capabilities of the next generation of MLFFs. Our code is available at this https URL.

Title: Threshold-less and Flexibly Tunable Frequency Comb via Floquet Engineering
Authors: Sihan Wang, Cheng Wang, Matthijs H. J. de Jong, Laure Mercier de Lépinay, Jingwei Zhou, Mika A. Sillanpää, Yulong Liu
Abstract: Frequency combs have revolutionized communication, metrology and spectroscopy. Numerous efforts have been dedicated to developing integrated combs, predominantly relying on Pockels or Kerr mechanisms. In this work, we propose and demonstrate a new type of frequency comb-Floquet cavity frequency comb-that does not rely on intrinsic material non-linearity. By periodically modulating the resonance frequency of a cavity, a Floquet cavity with multiple equally spaced frequency components is created. The pump tone interacts with the pre-modulated cavity, generating the output frequency comb. This approach offers a flexible tuning range and operates in a threshold-less manner, obviating the need to overcome nonlinear initiation threshold. We implement this on a microwave cavity optomechanical system on-chip. Compared to Kerr optomechanical combs, this approach efficiently generates comb with pump signal far from the cavity's intrinsic frequency, and the power required for detection is reduced by approximately a factor of \(10^6\), providing a promising platform for frequency comb generation.

Title: Quantitative Lineshape Analysis for Arbitrary Inhomogeneity in Two-Dimensional Coherent Spectroscopy
Authors: Bhaskar De, Pradeep Kumar, Krishna K. Maurya, Rishabh Tripathi, Rohan Singh
Abstract: Two-dimensional coherent spectroscopy (2DCS) provides simultaneous measurement of homogeneous and inhomogeneous linewidths through quantitative lineshape analysis. However, conventional lineshape analysis methods assume Gaussian inhomogeneity, limiting its applicability to systems with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. We present a quantitative lineshape analysis method incorporating arbitrary inhomogeneity using a bivariate spectral distribution function in 2DCS simulations. An algorithm is developed to extract the homogeneous linewidth and arbitrary inhomogeneous distribution from experimentally-measured 2D spectrum. We demonstrate this framework for a quantum-well-exciton resonance with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity. This work broadens the scope of quantitative lineshape analysis for studying materials with non-Gaussian inhomogeneity.

Title: Flowing from the Ising Model on the Fuzzy Sphere to the 3D Lee-Yang CFT
Authors: Joan Elias Miro, Olivier Delouche
Abstract: We employ the Fuzzy Sphere regulator to study the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. The model is defined by deforming the Ising model on the Fuzzy Sphere via a purely imaginary longitudinal magnetic field. This model undergoes a quantum phase transition, whose critical point we determine and identify with the 3D Lee-Yang CFT. We show how to tune the model and find that the lowest-lying states of the Hamiltonian align well with the expected CFT spectrum. We discuss the Fuzzy Sphere estimates for the scaling dimension $\Delta_\phi$ of the lowest primary operator. Finally, we interpret small deviations from the CFT expectations in terms of the leading irrelevant operators of the Lee-Yang CFT. We show that the Fuzzy Sphere calculations are compatible with the best five-loop $\epsilon$-expansion estimates.

Title: Universal scaling of intra-urban climate fluctuations
Authors: Marc Duran-Sala, Martin Hendrick, Gabriele Manoli
Abstract: Urban-induced changes in local microclimate, such as the urban heat island effect and air pollution, are known to vary with city size, leading to distinctive relations between average climate variables and city-scale quantities (e.g., total population or area). However, these approaches suffer from biases related to the choice of city boundaries and they neglect intra-urban variations of urban characteristics. Here we use high-resolution data of urban temperatures, air quality, population counts, and street intersections from 142 cities worldwide and show that their marginal and joint probability distributions follow universal scaling functions. By using a logarithmic relation between urban spatial features and climate variables, we show that average street network properties are sufficient to characterize the entire variability of the temperature and air pollution fields observed within and across cities. We further demonstrate that traditional models linking climate variables to the distance from the city center fail to reproduce the observed distributions unless the stochasticity of urban structure is fully considered. These findings provide a unified statistical framework for characterizing intra-urban climate variability, with important implications for climate modelling and urban planning.

Title: Is GGAG:Ce@SiO$_2$-RB composite a prospective material for X-ray induced photodynamic therapy?
Authors: Iveta Terezie Hošnová, Kristýna Havlinová, Jan Bárta, Karolína Mocová, Xenie Lytvynenko, Lenka Prouzová Procházková, Vojtěch Kazda, František Hájek, Viliam Múčka, Václav Čuba
Abstract: Nanocomposite material ($\mathrm{GGAG:Ce^{3+}@SiO_2-RB}$) for potential use in X-ray induced photodynamic therapy (X-PDT) was developed, thoroughly characterized, and evaluated. It consists of a scintillating $\mathrm{Gd_3(Ga_{1-x}Al_x)_5O_{12}:Ce^{3+}}$ core encapsulated in silica layer and functionalized with the photosensitizer Rose Bengal (RB). Radioluminescence measurements confirmed the energy transfer from the scintillating core to Rose Bengal. Dark toxicity and radiosensitisation effects were evaluated using Saccharomyces cerevisiae as a model organism. The nanocomposite showed minimal dark toxicity at concentrations of up to 10 mg/mL. However, X-ray irradiation experiments did not demonstrate significant singlet oxygen production compared to the controls. Although the nanocomposite design shows potential, further optimization is needed to achieve an effective X-PDT performance.
