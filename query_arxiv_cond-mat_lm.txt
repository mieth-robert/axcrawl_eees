Title: Rolling at right angles: magnetic anisotropy enables dual-anisotropic active matter
Authors: Eavan Fitzgerald, Cécile Clavaud, Debasish Das, Isaac C.D. Lenton, Scott R. Waitukaitis
Abstract: We report on an experimental active matter system with motion restricted to four cardinal directions. Our particles are magnetite-doped colloidal spheres driven by the Quincke electrorotational instability. The absence of a magnetic field $(|\mathbf{B}|=0)$ leads to circular trajectories interspersed with short spontaneous runs. Intermediate fields $(|\mathbf{B}|\lesssim 20~\text{mT})$ linearize the motion orthogonal to the field -- the axial mode. At high magnetic fields, we observe the surprising emergence of a second linearization parallel to the field -- the tumbling mode, distinct from the first orthogonal linearization. With numerical simulations, we show that this behavior can be explained by anisotropic magnetic susceptibility.

Title: Quantum criticality and nonequilibrium dynamics on a Lieb lattice of Rydberg atoms
Authors: Mark R. Hirsbrunner, Milan Kornjača, Rhine Samajdar, Siva Darbha, Majd Hamdan, Jan Balewski, Ermal Rrapaj, Sheng-Tao Wang, Daan Camps, Fangli Liu, Pedro L. S. Lopes, Katherine Klymko
Abstract: Neutral-atom quantum simulators offer a promising approach to the exploration of strongly interacting many-body systems, with applications spanning condensed matter, statistical mechanics, and high-energy physics. Through a combination of quantum experiments, numerical calculations, and analytical methods, we demonstrate a rich set of phenomena accessible on such quantum simulators by studying an array of Rydberg atoms placed on the Lieb lattice. First, we map out the ground states and phase diagram of the system, identifying a range of density-wave-ordered phases,and find excellent agreement between theory and experiment. Allowing for local control of the detuning field thereafter, we discover a quantum analog of the classical liquid--vapor transition and probe its underlying hysteretic dynamics. Furthermore, we study out-of-equilibrium quantum quenches and observe anomalously slow relaxation dynamics arising from kinetic constraints. These results highlight how geometric control offered by neutral-atom simulators can extend the frontiers of programmable quantum matter, enabling access to complex phases, metastability, and thermalization dynamics in many-body quantum systems.

Title: Universal Magnetocaloric Effect near Quantum Critical Point of Magnon Bose-Einstein Condensation
Authors: Junsen Xiang, Enze Lv, Qinxin Shen, Cheng Su, Xuetong He, Yinghao Zhu, Yuan Gao, Xin-Yang Liu, Dai-Wei Qu, Xinlei Wang, Xi Chen, Qian Zhao, Haifeng Li, Shuo Li, Jie Yang, Jun Luo, Peijie Sun, Wentao Jin, Yang Qi, Rui Zhou, Wei Li, Gang Su
Abstract: Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC), a macroscopic quantum phenomenon arising from phase coherence and bosonic statistics, has been realized in quantum magnets. Here, we report the observation of a universal magnetocaloric effect (MCE) near a BEC quantum critical point (QCP) in copper sulfate crystal ($CuSO_4 \cdot 5H_2O$). By conducting magnetocaloric and nuclear magnetic resonance measurements, we uncover a field-driven BEC QCP, evidenced by the universal scaling law $T_c \propto (B_c - B)^{2/3}$ and the perfect data collapse of the magnetic Grüneisen ratio. Thermal excitation triggers a dimensional crossover to a 1D quantum-critical regime, where the MCE scaling strictly matches the universality class of 1D Fermi gases. Notably, the quantum-critical MCE enables cooling down to 12.8 mK without helium-3, with very fast thermal relaxation rate that is critical for high cooling power. This work demonstrates the universal MCE in magnon BEC systems, using a common copper sulfate compound as a paradigmatic example, and paves the way for next-generation sub-Kelvin cooling.

Title: Evaluating Universal Machine Learning Force Fields Against Experimental Measurements
Authors: Sajid Mannan, Vaibhav Bihani, Carmelo Gonzales, Kin Long Kelvin Lee, Nitya Nand Gosvami, Sayan Ranu, Santiago Miret, N M Anoop Krishnan
Abstract: Universal machine learning force fields (UMLFFs) promise to revolutionize materials science by enabling rapid atomistic simulations across the periodic table. However, their evaluation has been limited to computational benchmarks that may not reflect real-world performance. Here, we present UniFFBench, a comprehensive framework for evaluating UMLFFs against experimental measurements of ~1,500 carefully curated mineral structures spanning diverse chemical environments, bonding types, structural complexity, and elastic properties. Our systematic evaluation of six state-of-the-art UMLFFs reveals a substantial reality gap: models achieving impressive performance on computational benchmarks often fail when confronted with experimental complexity. Even the best-performing models exhibit higher density prediction error than the threshold required for practical applications. Most strikingly, we observe disconnects between simulation stability and mechanical property accuracy, with prediction errors correlating with training data representation rather than the modeling method. These findings demonstrate that while current computational benchmarks provide valuable controlled comparisons, they may overestimate model reliability when extrapolated to experimentally complex chemical spaces. Altogether, UniFFBench establishes essential experimental validation standards and reveals systematic limitations that must be addressed to achieve truly universal force field capabilities.

Title: Dynamics and rupture of doped Motility Induced Phase Peparation
Authors: Rodrigo Fernández-Quevedo García, Enrique Chacón, Pedro Tarazona, Chantal Valeriani
Abstract: Adding a small amount of passive (Brownian) particles to a two-dimensional dense suspension of repulsive active Brownian particles does not affect the appearance of a motility-induced phase separation into a dense and a dilute phase, caused by the persistence of the active particles' direction of motion. Unlike a purely active suspension, the dense slab formed in an elongated system of a passive-active mixture may show, over long periods of time, a stable and well-defined propagation of the interfaces, because of the symmetry breaking caused by the depletion of passive particles on one side of the slab. We investigate these dynamical structures via average density profile calculations, revealing an asymmetry between the two interfaces, and enabling a kinetic analysis of the slab movement. The apparent movement of the dense slab is not a pure source/sink effect, nor a rigid displacement of all the particles, but a self-sustained combination of both effects. Furthermore, we analyse the specific fluctuations that produce, cancel and abruptly reverse the slab motion.

Title: A free fermions in disguise model with claws
Authors: Kohei Fukai, István Vona, Balázs Pozsgay
Abstract: Recently, several spin chain models have been discovered that admit solutions in terms of "free fermions in disguise." A graph-theoretical treatment of such models was also established, giving sufficient conditions for free fermionic solvability. These conditions involve a particular property of the so-called frustration graph of the Hamiltonian, namely that it must be claw-free. Additionally, one set of sufficient conditions also requires the absence of so-called even holes. In this paper, we present a model with disguised free fermions where the frustration graph contains both claws and even holes. Special relations between coupling constants ensure that the free fermionic property still holds. The transfer matrix of this model can be factorized in a special case, thereby proving the conjectured free fermionic nature of a special quantum circuit published recently by two of the present authors. This is the first example of free fermions in disguise with both claws and even holes simultaneously.

Title: Observing Differential Spin Currents by Resonant Inelastic X-ray Scattering
Authors: Yanhong Gu, Joseph Barker, Jiemin Li, Takashi Kikkawa, Fernando Camino, Kim Kisslinger, John Sinsheimer, Lukas Lienhard, Jackson J. Bauer, Caroline A. Ross, Dmitri N. Basov, Eiji Saitoh, Jonathan Pelliciari, Gerrit E. W. Bauer, Valentina Bisogni
Abstract: Controlling spin currents, i.e., the flow of spin angular momentum, in small magnetic devices is the principal objective of spin electronics, a main contender for future energy efficient information technologies. Surprisingly, a pure spin current has never been measured directly since the associated electric stray fields and/or shifts in the non-equilibrium spin-dependent distribution functions are too small for conventional experimental detection methods optimized for charge transport. Here we report that resonant inelastic x-ray scattering (RIXS) can bridge this gap by measuring the spin current carried by magnons -- the quanta of the spin wave excitations of the magnetic order -- in the presence of temperature gradients across a magnetic insulator. This is possible due to the sensitivity of the momentum- and energy-resolved RIXS intensity to minute changes in the magnon distribution under non-equilibrium conditions. We use the Boltzmann equation in the relaxation time approximation to extract transport parameters, such as the magnon lifetime at finite momentum, essential for the realization of magnon spintronics.

Title: Rydberg Exciton Dynamics in the Blockade Regime of Cu2O
Authors: Gillian E. Minarik, Eric A. Arsenault, Vinícius da Silveira Lan Avelar, Taketo Handa, X.-Y. Zhu
Abstract: Hosting giant Rydberg excitons with principal quantum numbers up to n = 30, cuprous oxide (Cu2O) provides a rare solid-state setting for exploring Rydberg physics, as exemplified by the blockade effect. Here we access the strongly interaction regime at high excitation densities (10^14-10^16/cm^3) and resolve the corresponding blockade dynamics for n = 2-7 using time-resolved spectroscopy. We find that Rydberg blockades are primarily governed by resonant dipolar interactions and that exciton recombination is coupled to the blockade itself. These findings demonstrate the potential for manipulating Rydberg exctions in the strongly interacting blockade regime in a solid state system.

Title: Simulation of a generalized asset exchange model with investment and income mechanisms
Authors: Jan Tobochnik, Harvey Gould, William Klein
Abstract: An agent-based model of the economy is generalized to incorporate investment and guaranteed income mechanisms in addition to the exchange and distribution mechanisms considered in earlier models. We find realistic wealth distributions and realistic values of the Gini coefficients and the Pareto index. We also show that although the system reaches a steady state, the system is not in thermal equilibrium. The nonequilibrium behavior is associated with the multiplicative noise generated by the investment mechanism.

Title: Emerging ultra-wide band gap semiconductors for future high-frequency electronics
Authors: Emily M. Garrity, Theodora Ciobanu, Andriy Zakutayev, Vladan Stevanovic
Abstract: To meet the growing demands of advanced electronic systems, next-generation power and RF semiconductor devices must operate efficiently at higher power levels and switching frequencies while remaining compact. Current state-of-the-art GaN semiconductor devices alone cannot meet all these demands. Emerging ultra-wide band gap (UWBG) alternatives like diamond, BN, AlN, and Ga2O3, face significant challenges including limited wafer availability, doping difficulties, and thermal management constraints. Herein we conduct a high-throughput computational screening for new semiconductors for high-frequency electronics. In our analysis we compute the modeled Johnson and Baliga high-frequency figures of merit in combination with thermal conductivity to assess their potential for RF and power devices. We show that there are plenty of alternative materials to explore and conclude by discussing dopability and synthesis of select candidate materials. This study lays the foundation for discovering new semiconductors that can push the boundaries of performance in applications ranging from EV chargers and solid-state transformers to sub-THz communications and advanced radar technologies.

Title: Unexpectedly large entropic barrier controls bond rearrangements in vitrimers
Authors: Shinian Cheng, Lilliana Rey, Beibei Yao, Ivan Popov, Alexei P. Sokolov
Abstract: Vitrimers are a relatively new class of polymeric materials containing associative covalent dynamic bonds that make them recyclable by design. However, the fundamental mechanisms controlling their viscoelastic properties remain poorly understood. Our detailed studies of relaxation dynamics and viscoelastic behavior of model vitrimers revealed that the density of dynamic covalent crosslinks has no influence on chain dynamics (beyond a weak change in the glass transition temperature), yet it strongly affects the linear viscoelasticity of vitrimers. Increasing the crosslink density induces a sol-gel transition consistent with predictions of classical gelation theory, demonstrating its applicability to vitrimers. Remarkably, the temperature-dependent analysis of the bond rearrangement time reveals an unexpectedly large negative activation entropy in the transition state that strongly slows down the bond exchange process despite its relatively low activation enthalpy. This insight explains the unusual long timescale for bond rearrangement in vitrimers and highlights the significance of entropy in controlling the viscoelasticity of dynamic covalent networks.

Title: Fusion and Fission of Particle-like Chiral Nematic Vortex Knots
Authors: Darian Hall, Jung-Shen Benny Tai, Louis H. Kauffman, Ivan I. Smalyukh
Abstract: Vortex knots have been seen decaying in many physical systems. Here we describe topologically protected vortex knots, which remain stable and undergo fusion and fission while conserving a topological invariant analogous to that of baryon number. While the host medium, a chiral nematic liquid crystal, exhibits intrinsic chirality, cores of the vortex lines are structurally achiral regions where twist cannot be defined. We refer to them as "dischiralation" vortex lines, in analogy to dislocations and disclinations in ordered media where, respectively, positional and orientational order is disrupted. Fusion and fission of these vortex knots, which we reversibly switch by electric pulses, vividly reveal the physical embodiments of knot theory's concepts like connected sums of knots. Our findings provide insights into related phenomena in fields ranging from cosmology to particle physics and can enable applications in electro-optics and photonics, where such fusion and fission processes can be used for controlling light.

Title: Spin-resolved Josephson diode effect through strongly spin-polarized conical magnets
Authors: Danilo Nikolić, Niklas L. Schulz, Alexander I. Buzdin, Matthias Eschrig
Abstract: We present a theoretical study of the spin-resolved Josephson diode effect in junctions comprising strongly spin-polarized conical magnets (FM) coupled to singlet superconductors (SC). The system is treated by making use of the Gor$^\prime$kov and quasiclassical Green$^\prime$s function methods. Modeling the SC/FM interfaces as spin-dependent $\delta$-potentials, we apply our model to an SC/FM/SC junction and account for the Josephson current-phase relation (CPR). The nontrivial coupling between the spin bands in the conical magnet gives rise to a strong Josephson diode effect with an efficiency greater than 40%. The effect essentially depends on the quantum spin-geometric phase that enters the Josephson CPR in a very similar manner to the superconducting phase difference. The former is generated non-locally by the intrinsically noncoplanar spin arrangement of the conical magnet, which breaks the time-reversal and inversion symmetries. Strong spin polarization and a helical pitch of the conical magnet comparable to the superconducting coherence length are essential for the effect. We perform a harmonic analysis of the Josephson CPR and interpret the effect in terms of coherent transfer of multiple equal-spin triplet Cooper pairs across the conical magnet.

Title: Isolated spin ladders in Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln:La-Nd) metals
Authors: Brenden R. Ortiz, Heda Zhang, Karolina Gornicka, Matthew S. Cook, Suchismita Sarker, Satoshi Okamoto, Jiaqiang Yan
Abstract: Here we present the discovery and characterization of a series of antimonides Ln$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ (Ln: La--Nd) which exhibit well-isolated, $n=2$ rare-earth spin ladders. We discuss the structure of the new compounds, with a particular focus on the magnetic Ln spin ladders. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ and Ce$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibit antiferromagnetic interactions and a well-defined doublet ground state, whereas Pr$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ exhibits a weakly magnetic singlet ground state. Nd$_2$Ti$_9$Sb$_{11}$ is a poor metal with an electrical resistivity of 0.1m$\Omega$-cm at 300K and weak temperature dependence. The thermal conductivity along the ladder exhibits significant field dependence even at 40K, considerably higher than the magnetic ordering temperature of 1.1K. Compared to compounds with transition metal spin ladders, the rare-earth elements impart much lower energy scales, making these compounds highly tunable with external stimuli like magnetic fields. The diverse magnetism of the rare-earth ions and RKKY interactions further contribute to the potential for a wide array of rich magnetic ground states, positioning these materials as a rare example of an inorganic square spin-ladder platform.

Title: Structural and Optical Properties of Crystal Ion Sliced BaTiO$_3$ Thin Films
Authors: Hossein Esfandiar, Fatemeh Abtahi, Trevor G. Vrckovnik, G. Quyet Ngo, Rene Heller, Ulrich Kentsch, Fabian Ganss, Stefan Facsko, Uta Lucchesi, Stephan Winnerl, Falk Eilenberger, Dennis Arslan, Sebastian W. Schmitt
Abstract: Barium titanate (BaTiO$_3$) is a compelling material for integrated photonics due to its strong electro-optic and second-order nonlinear properties. Crystal Ion Slicing (CIS) presents a scalable and CMOS-compatible route for fabricating thin BaTiO$_3$ films; however, ion implantation during CIS introduces lattice damage that can degrade structural and optical performance. In this study, we demonstrate that post-slicing thermal annealing effectively restores the structural integrity and optical quality of CIS-processed BaTiO$_3$ flakes. Raman spectroscopy confirms the recovery of crystallinity, while second-harmonic generation (SHG) microscopy reveals systematic reorientation of ferroelectric domains and restoration of the associated second-order nonlinear susceptibility tensor $X^{(2)}$. Notably, SHG signals persist even in regions with weak Raman signatures, indicating that long-range ferroelectric order can survive despite partial lattice disruption. Optical measurements show that the linear dispersion of annealed CIS flakes closely matches that of bulk BaTiO$_3$, validating their suitability for photonic integration. Together, these results qualify CIS - combined with thermal annealing - as a viable and scalable manufacturing strategy for high-quality BaTiO$_3$-on-insulator (BTOI) platforms, enabling advanced integrated photonic devices for modulation, frequency conversion, and quantum optics.

Title: Quantum Hall Resistance and Quantum Hall Plateaus from Edge State Quantization
Authors: Pedro Pereyra
Abstract: Despite the extensive literature on the quantum Hall effect (QHE), a direct derivation of the phenomenological formula $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$ from first principles has remained elusive. In this work, we revisit the Landau and Landauer-Büttiker formalisms and impose hard-wall boundary conditions on the wavefunction, an essential but often overlooked constraint. This condition quantizes the guiding center position and the longitudinal wave number $k_x$, leading naturally to a discrete number of edge states without invoking energy bending. We derive the Hall resistance directly and recover the standard result $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2\nu$, along with an explicit expression for the filling factor $\nu$ in terms of the Fermi energy and magnetic field. The resulting resistance steps reproduce the observed QHE plateaus and match experimental data without fitting parameters.

Title: Dimensionality-induced dynamical phase transition in the large deviation of local time density for Brownian motion
Authors: Ruofei Yan, Hanshuang Chen
Abstract: We study the fluctuation properties of the local time density, ${\rho _T} = \frac{1}{T}\int_0^T {\delta ( {r(t) - 1} )} dt$, spent by a $d$-dimensional Brownian particle at a spherical shell of unit radius, where $r(t)$ denotes the radial distance from the particle to the origin. In the large observation time limit, $T \to \infty$, the local time density $\rho_T$ obeys the large deviation principle, $P(\rho _T= \rho) \sim e^{-T I(\rho)}$, where the rate function $I(\rho)$ is analytic everywhere for $d\leq 4$. In contrast, for $d>4$, $I(\rho)$ becomes nonanalytic at a specific point $\rho=\rho_c^{(d)}$, where $\rho_c^{(d)}=d(d-4)/(2d-4)$ depends solely on dimensionality. The singularity signals the occurrence of a first-order dynamical phase transition in dimensions higher than four. Such a transition is accompanied by temporal phase separations in the large deviations of Brownian trajectories. Finally, we validate our theoretical results using a rare-event simulation approach.

Title: Topological Defect Formation Beyond the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism in Crossover Transitions with Approximate Symmetries
Authors: Peng Yang, Chuan-Yin Xia, Sebastian Grieninger, Hua-Bi Zeng, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: The formation of topological defects during continuous second-order phase transitions is well described by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). However, when the spontaneously broken symmetry is only approximate, such transitions become smooth crossovers, and the applicability of KZM in these scenarios remains an open question. In this work, we address this problem by analyzing both a weakly coupled Ginzburg-Landau model and a strongly coupled holographic setup, each featuring pseudo-spontaneous breaking of a global U(1) symmetry. In the slow quench regime, we observe a breakdown of the universal power-law scaling predicted by the Kibble-Zurek Mechanism. Specifically, the defect density acquires an exponential correction dependent on the quench rate, following a universal form dictated by the source of explicit symmetry breaking. Although these dynamics extend beyond the scope of the traditional KZM, we demonstrate that a generalized framework, that incorporates the effects of explicit symmetry breaking into the dynamical correlation length, remains valid and accurately captures the non-equilibrium defect formation across the entire range of quench rates.

Title: Revisiting $μ$SR Studies of Ion Dynamics in the Light of Extended Kubo-Toyabe Model
Authors: Takashi U. Ito, Ryosuke Kadono
Abstract: The dynamical Kubo-Toyabe (dKT) function is extended to describe the spin relaxation under the coexisting dynamical and static internal magnetic fields. A detailed re-evaluation of the previous $\mu^\pm$SR data in Na$_x$CoO$_2$ using this function disfavors the conventional interpretation based on sodium-ion diffusion and instead supports the $\mu^+$ self-diffusion scenario. This also resolves the long-standing inconsistencies in the dKT-function-based $\mu$SR studies on ion diffusion from the viewpoint of classical over-barrier-jump mechanism.

Title: Photodynamic melting of phase-reversed charge stripes and enhanced condensation
Authors: Jianhao Sun, Richard T. Scalettar, Rubem Mondaini
Abstract: The interplay between charge stripes and pairing is a longstanding point of scrutiny in a broad class of unconventional superconductors since, in some cases, it is unclear whether their intertwining benefits the ensuing superfluidity. Experiments that explore the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of these systems try to tip the balance in favor of one phase or the other by selective coupling to relevant modes. Leveraging the fact that competition between stripes and pairing is not exclusive to fermionic systems, we explore the photoirradiation dynamics of interacting hardcore bosons, in which density wave phase-reversal melting gives rise to enhanced superfluid properties, quantified by the dynamic amplification of zero-momentum occupancy and charge stiffness. Our results, obtained using unbiased methods for an interacting system on a ladder geometry, demonstrate how one can engineer time-dependent perturbations to release suppressed orders, potentially providing insight into the underlying mechanism in related experiments.

Title: Reconstructing Critical Current Density in Josephson Junctions with Phase Non-linearity
Authors: A. Kudriashov, R. A. Hovhannisyan, X. Zhou, L. Elesin, L. V. Yashina, K. S. Novoselov, D. A. Bandurin
Abstract: In this Letter, we show that the standard Dynes-Fulton analysis, commonly used to reconstruct the critical current density from interference patterns, breaks down in Josephson junctions with nonlinear phase distributions, leading to non-physical artifacts. To address this, we developed a simple iterative reconstruction algorithm and validated it both numerically and experimentally using a planar Josephson junction model. Unlike conventional approaches based on the logarithmic Hilbert transform, the proposed method allows for incorporating prior knowledge about the system and addresses the fundamental issue of ambiguity in reconstructing the critical current density from interference patterns.

Title: Vacuum Dealloyed Brass as Li-Metal Battery Current Collector: Effect of Zinc and Porosity

Abstract: "Anode-free" lithium-metal batteries promise significantly higher energy density than conventional graphite-based lithium-ion batteries; however, lithium dendrite growth can lead to internal short circuits with associated safety risks. While porous current collectors can suppress dendrite growth, optimal porosity and composition remain unknown. Here, we show that the temperature during vapor phase dealloying (VPD) of alpha-brass (Cu63Zn37) controls the surface Zn concentration, decreasing from 8 percent to below 1 percent from 500 to 800 degrees C. The surface composition is controlled by the temperature-dependent diffusion. A battery cell maintains greater than 90 percent Coulombic efficiency (CE) over 100 cycles when the Zn content is the lowest, whereas the higher-Zn samples degraded to approximately 70 percent CE. The difference in surface composition has hence dramatic effects on battery performance, and our results demonstrate how precise compositional control enables stable lithium-metal battery operation, establishing about 1 atomic percent surface Zn as optimal for preventing capacity fading and uniform lithium plating, while establishing predictive relationships between processing temperature and surface composition. This work provides design rules for multifunctional current collectors and demonstrates scalable VPD production for next-generation batteries.

Title: Magic Entropy in Hybrid Spin-Boson Systems
Authors: Samuel Crew, Ying-Lin Li, Heng-Hsi Li, Po-Yao Chang
Abstract: We introduce entropic measures to quantify non-classical resource in hybrid spin-boson systems. We discuss the stabilizer Rényi entropy in the framework of phase space quantisation and define an analogous hybrid magic entropy and a mutual magic entropy that capture the distribution of quantum magic across spin and bosonic subsystems. We use these entropic measures to demonstrate two key phenomena: the detection of the superradiant phase transition in the Dicke model and the dynamics of magic in the Jaynes-Cummings model following a quench. We develop a Monte Carlo numerical scheme to enable practical computation in many-body examples.

Title: Analysis of Spin Current Generation by Elastic Waves in $f$-wave Altermagnets
Authors: Ken Uchino, Yuuki Ogawa, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the mechanism of spin current generation induced by elastic waves in nonrelativistic magnets referred to as altermagnets. By analyzing an $f$-wave altermagnet formed by a three-sublattice noncollinear antiferromagnetic structure breaking the spatial inversion symmetry on a two-dimensional triangular lattice within the linear response theory, we show that the nonrelativistic antisymmetric spin-split band structure can give rise to spin current generation when either longitudinal or transverse elastic wave is applied. We find that the momentum dependence of the antisymmetric spin splitting leads to a characteristic direction-dependent spin current response. We also compare the present nonrelativistic magnetic-order-driven mechanism with the relativistic one in a nonmagnetic Rashba system. These findings highlight the potential of invesion-symmetry-breaking altermagnets as a spin current generator driven by elasticity without relying on the relativistic spin-orbit coupling.

Title: Scalable High-Temperature Superconducting Diodes in Intrinsic Josephson Junctions

Abstract: Superconducting diodes, characterized by nonreciprocal supercurrent transport, offer transformative opportunities for ultra-low-power circuits. However, achieving reliable operation at temperatures above liquid nitrogen remains a major challenge, limiting their practical applicability. Here, we present a scalable strategy for high-temperature superconducting diodes based on intrinsic Josephson junctions naturally present in a cuprate superconductor. We demonstrate that strong nonreciprocity arises not only from broken spatial and time-reversal symmetries, but also from enhanced anharmonicity in the current-phase relation, enabled by the atomically thin barrier of the intrinsic junction. The diode efficiency strongly depends on the number of stacked intrinsic junctions, with the highest efficiency occurring in single-junction devices. Notably, these high-temperature superconducting diodes are readily scalable to large arrays, marking a critical step toward practical implementation in energy-efficient computing architectures.

Title: Operation Regimes and Design Principles of Delta-E Effect Sensors
Authors: Fatih Ilgaz, Elizaveta Spetzler, Patrick Wiegand, Robert Rieger, Jeffrey McCord, Benjamin Spetzler
Abstract: Delta-E effect-based magnetoelectric sensors have emerged as promising technology for detecting weak magnetic fields at low frequencies. However, the performance of such sensors remains difficult to predict, as signal and noise characteristics are dictated by interdependent parameters such as magnetic layer geometry, magnetic microstructure, and loss. In this work, we present a systematic experimental study of sub-mm-sized delta-E effect sensors, comprising 24 device configurations that vary in magnetic layer thickness and lateral dimensions. The sensors are statistically analyzed to identify the influence of magnetic layer geometry on performance through a combination of measurements and simulations. Our findings reveal three distinct operation regimes - dominated by electronic noise, magnetic noise, and nonlinearities - whose boundaries shift systematically with magnetic layer thickness. This regime behavior governs the trade-offs between sensitivity and noise, ultimately determining the sensor's limit of detection. Based on these results, the dependency of the regime boundaries on key device parameters is discussed in detail, providing fundamental insights for tailoring sensor performance. As such, this study establishes a necessary foundation for targeted performance optimization and the scalable design of advanced delta-E effect sensor systems.

Title: Revealing the Staging Structural Evolution and Li (De)Intercalation Kinetics in Graphite Anodes via Machine Learning Potential
Authors: Liqi Wang, Xuhe Gong, Zicun Li, Ruijuan Xiao, Hong Li
Abstract: Revealing the dynamic structural evolution and lithium transport properties during the charge/discharge processes is crucial for optimizing graphite anodes in lithium-ion batteries, enabling high stability and fast-charging performance. However, the dynamic coupling mechanisms among carbon layer kinetics, lithium (de)intercalation/diffusion, and defects regulation remain insufficiently understood. In this study, we developed a universal automated workflow based on machine learning potentials to simulate the dynamic lithium (de)intercalation process. With this approach, the staging structural evolution of lithium-graphite intercalation compounds and their lithium transport behavior were resolved through molecular dynamics simulations. By introducing stacking faults into the graphite structure, we successfully simulated stage transitions driven by carbon layer sliding and reorganization, accompanied by stress release and structural stabilization. The dynamics of carbon layers regulate the lithium (de)intercalation positional selectivity, producing intermediate states with varying lithium concentrations and distributions during cycling. This facilitates the formation and transformation of stage structures while mitigating residual stress accumulation. A fundamental kinetic asymmetry arises between lithium intercalation and deintercalation, driven by the continuous and heterogeneous lithium transport and carbon layer sliding during charge/discharge processes. The carbon defects regulate lithium transport, in which the atomic-scale defects confine intralayer lithium transport and carbon sliding while enabling interlayer transport via dynamic lithium trapping/release mechanisms. Accordingly, for the future design, it is critical to construct structural units with controllable carbon layer sliding/reorganization, and tunable defects to enhance lithium-ion transport.

Title: $μ_\mathrm{2T}(n)$: A Method for Extracting the Density Dependent Mobility in Two-Terminal Nanodevices
Authors: Christian E. N. Petersen, Damon J. Carrad, Thierry Désiré, Daria Beznasyuk, Jung-Hyun Kang, Dāgs Olšteins, Gunjan Nagda, Dennis V. Christensen, Thomas Sand Jespersen
Abstract: Measuring carrier mobility as a function of the carrier density in semiconductors using Hall effect is the gold standard for quantifying scattering mechanisms. However, for nanostructures, the Hall effect is not applicable, and the density dependence of mobility is generally inaccessible, rendering Hall effect measurements impractical. Here, we present $\mu_\mathrm{2T}(n)$, a new procedure allowing us to extract the density dependent mobility in two-terminal measured nano scale field effect transistors at zero magnetic field from conventional conductance vs gate voltage measurements. We validate $\mu_\mathrm{2T}$ against standard Hall measurements and then apply the procedure to 256 individual two-terminal InAs nanowire FETs, extracting information about the scattering mechanisms. To illustrate its broad utility, we reanalyze published data in which mobility had been treated as density independent. Our method represents a new powerful tool for optimization and development of nanomaterials crucial for a wide range of new technologies.

Title: Thermodynamic uncertainty relation for feedback cooling
Authors: Kousuke Kumasaki, Kaito Tojo, Takahiro Sagawa, Ken Funo
Abstract: Feedback cooling enables a system to achieve low temperatures through measurement-based control. Determining the thermodynamic cost required to achieve the ideal cooling efficiency within a finite time remains an important problem. In this work, we establish a thermodynamic uncertainty relation (TUR) for feedback cooling in classical underdamped Langevin systems, thereby deriving a trade-off between the cooling efficiency and the entropy reduction rate. The obtained TUR implies that simultaneous achievement of the ideal cooling efficiency and finite entropy reduction rate is asymptotically possible by letting the fluctuation of the reversible local mean velocity diverge. This is shown to be feasible by using a feedback control based on the Kalman filter. Our results clarify the thermodynamic costs of achieving the fundamental cooling limit of feedback control from the perspective of the TUR.

Abstract: Proximitized Ge quantum wells have emerged as a novel platform for studying Andreev bound states (ABSs), due to their expected strong spin-orbit interaction and high mobility. Here, we used microwave spectroscopy techniques to investigate ABSs in Josephson junctions (JJs) realized in proximitized Ge quantum wells. Spectroscopic signatures observed in a 350 nm junction indicated the presence of multiple ABSs, and were reproduced with a model including finite-length effects. The ABS spectra measured for a $1.2~\mu$m junction were explained by a model including three ABSs in two conduction channels and finite Coulomb interaction. Our work highlights the importance of interactions in JJs and serves as a basis for understanding and manipulating ABSs in Ge-based hybrid devices.

Title: Enhancing Plasmonic Superconductivity in Layered Materials via Dynamical Coulomb Engineering
Authors: Yann in 't Veld, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Andrew J. Millis, Malte Rösner
Abstract: Conventional Coulomb engineering, through controlled manipulation of the environment, offers an effective route to tune the correlation properties of atomically thin van der Waals materials via static screening. Here we present tunable dynamical screening as a method for precisely tailoring bosonic modes to optimize many-body properties. We show that ``bosonic engineering'' of plasmon modes can be used to enhance plasmon-induced superconducting critical temperatures of layered superconductors in metallic environments by up to an order of magnitude, due to the formation of interlayer hybridized plasmon modes with enhanced superconducting pairing strength. We determine optimal properties of the screening environment to maximize critical temperatures. We show how bosonic engineering can aid the search for experimental verification of plasmon mediated superconductivity.

Title: Scalable Production of Photochromic Yttrium Oxyhydride Powder via Ball Milling
Authors: Elbruz Murat Baba, Stefano Deledda, Smagul Karazhanov
Abstract: Yttrium oxyhydride (YHO) represents one of the most promising photochromic materials discovered in recent years, yet its practical deployment has been severely constrained by the limitations of thin film deposition methods. Here we demonstrate the first successful synthesis of photochromic YHO powders through reactive ball milling under hydrogen atmosphere followed by controlled oxidation a fundamentally scalable approach that overcomes the production barriers facing this technology. High-energy planetary ball milling of yttrium metal under 50 bar hydrogen for 20 hours, followed by controlled oxidation in ultra-dry technical air, yielded nanostructured YHO powders with less than 500 nm particle sizes. These powders exhibit robust photochromic response with reflectance modulation at 850 nm under 405 nm excitation, reversible cycling behavior, and the characteristic memory effect previously observed only in thin films. Powder X-ray diffraction confirms the formation of the cubic YHO phase with lattice expansion consistent with oxygen incorporation into the yttrium hydride structure. Critically, we demonstrate that YHO powders can be processed into polymer composites enabling spatially-resolved photochromic patterning a capability essential for practical device applications. While optimization of optical contrast remains an opportunity for future work, this powder synthesis route fundamentally transforms the manufacturing of YHO-based photochromic systems, enabling mass-scale production using established industrial ball milling infrastructure. These findings establish a viable pathway toward commercial deployment of YHO in smart windows, adaptive optics, and rewritable information storage applications.

Title: Bogoliubov analysis of Higgs mode in trapped Fermi superfluids with spatial inhomogeneity
Authors: Kensuke Kakimoto, Junichi Takahashi, Yoshiya Yamanaka
Abstract: The Higgs mode is a key component in the spontaneous breaking of a continuous symmetry along with the Nambu-Goldstone mode, and has been studied extensively for homogeneous systems. We consider it for inhomogeneous systems, using the superfluid of harmonically trapped ultracold Fermi atomic gas. The Fermionic field operators are expanded in a complete set of wave functions corresponding to inhomogeneous situation. Within the Hatree-Fock approximation, we derive integral equations from the Bogoliubov-de Gennes equations, which lead to the frequencies of the collective modes, including the Higgs and Nambu-Goldstone modes. The results show that the frequency of the Higgs mode equals twice the absolute value of the order parameter at the center of trap. This feature is robust against variations in the interaction strength, trap potential, and temperature. These results are consistent with previous theoretical and experimental studies.

Title: Correlation between Exciton Dynamics and Spin Structure in van der Waals Antiferromagnet NiPS3
Authors: Kang Wang, Yingchen Peng, Boying Huang, Chun Zhou, Qianlu Sun, Fujie Tang, Zhenglu Li, Weigao Xu, Kezhao Du, Xingzhi Wang, Ye Yang
Abstract: The emerging magnetic van der Waals (vdW) materials provide a platform for exploring novel physics regarding magnetism in low dimensions and developing ultrathin spintronic applications. Here, we investigate the ultrafast dynamics of excitons in a vdW NiPS3 crystal. The temporal evolution of the transient reflection spectra indicates that the spin-correlated exciton is formed through photocarrier localization, the rate of which is independent of the magnetic degrees of freedom. However, the recombination rate of these excitons is connected with the long-range magnetic order, and this connection probably arise from a spin-flip rooted in the underlying antiferromagnetic background during the recombination. Our findings uncover intertwined coupling between carrier, lattice and spin degrees of freedom in NiPS3, which may pave the path toward ultrafast optical manipulation of spin-related quantum states in vdW antiferromagnets.

Title: Active Particle Doping Suppresses Brittle Failure in Ultrastable Glasses
Authors: Rashmi Priya, Jürgen Horbach, Smarajit Karmakar
Abstract: Ultrastable glasses are known for their exceptional mechanical stability but often fail in a brittle manner, typically marked by the formation of shear bands when subjected to shear deformation. An open question is how shear banding is affected by active particles. Here, we address this issue by investigating ultrastable glasses that are doped with self-propelled particles (SPPs) that perform run-and-tumble motions. In the presence of active particles we find a crossover from heterogeneous to homogeneous yielding. Through extensive computer simulations of a polydisperse model, which is capable of producing ultrastable glasses using swap Monte Carlo Methods, we demonstrate the progressive emergence of multiple shear bands under activity, leading to continuous and delayed yielding. Interestingly, we uncover a compensatory relationship between active forces and global shear rates: a rise in one can offset a decline in the other, arising from the isomorphic-like behavior exhibited by different combinations of active forces and strain rates. We also identify a non-monotonic relationship between yielding and persistence time: while the yield stress increases at shorter persistence times with increasing active forces, it tends to decrease with longer persistence times. This observation highlights a tunable range of activity that can modify the yielding mode. Lastly, we show that the spacing between shear bands diminishes in a power law manner as the magnitude of the active force increases.

Title: Topological bound states in a lattice of rings with nearest-neighbour interactions
Authors: Yunjia Zhai, Ayaka Usui, Anselmo M. Marques, Ricardo G. Dias, Verònica Ahufinger
Abstract: We study interaction-induced bound states in a system of ultracold bosons loaded into the states with orbital angular momentum in a one-dimensional staggered lattice of rings. We consider the hard-core limit and strong nearest-neighbour interactions such that two particles in next neighbouring sites are bound. Focusing on the manifold of such bound states, we have derived the corresponding effective model for doublons. With orbital angular momentum $l=1$, the original physical system is described as a Creutz ladder by using the circulations as a synthetic dimension, and the effective model obtained consists of two Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chains and two Bose-Hubbard chains. Therefore, the system can exhibit topologically protected edge states. In a structure that alternates $l=1$ and $l=0$ states, the original system can be mapped to a diamond chain. In this case, the effective doublon model corresponds to a Creutz ladder with extra vertical hoppings between legs and can be mapped to two SSH chains if all the couplings in the original system are equal. Tuning spatially the amplitude of the couplings destroys the inversion symmetry of these SSH chains, but enables the appearance of multiple flat bands.

Title: Surface tension of monoatomic liquids after relaxation: the main energy contributions
Authors: Dmitry M. Naplekov, Vladimir V. Yanovsky
Abstract: We consider the atomistic origin and the main mechanisms determining the energy of a liquid interface after relaxation. A simple theory is constructed for the monatomic densely packed liquids that allows calculation of the surface tension coefficients based on the interatomic potential parameters, without fitting coefficients. Considered are the potential energies of both <<broken>> and stretched bonds between surface atoms. The later contribution is found to be from $20 \%$ to $45 \%$, with an average stretching of the first layer in the range of $7 \% - 14 \%$. The equality of the unit tension force and the unit surface energy is shown. The calculated surface tension coefficients relate to the experimental values as $1.0 - 1.3$ for the ten $fcc$ substances considered. For twenty $bcc$ substances, this range is $0.65 - 1.35$. The increase of density of the second atomic layer is predicted, due to its influence on the coordination number of surface atoms. For a convex surface, increase in the surface tension coefficient with increase in curvature is predicted.

Title: On-the-Fly Machine Learning of Interatomic Potentials for Elastic Property Modeling in Al-Mg-Zr Solid Solutions
Authors: Lukas Volkmer, Leonardo Medrano Sandonas, Philip Grimm, Julia Kristin Hufenbach, Gianaurelio Cuniberti
Abstract: The development of resilient and lightweight Aluminum alloys is central to advancing structural materials for energy-efficient engineering applications. To address this challenge, in this study, we explore the elastic properties of Al-Mg-Zr solid solutions by integrating advanced machine learning (ML) techniques with quantum-mechanical (QM) atomistic simulations. For this purpose, we develop accurate and transferable machine-learned interatomic potentials (MLIPs) using two complementary approaches: (i) an on-the-fly learning scheme combined with Bayesian linear regression during ab initio molecular dynamics simulations, and (ii) the equivariant neural network architecture MACE. Both MLIPs facilitate the prediction of composition-dependent elastic properties while drastically reducing the computational cost compared to conventional QM methods. Comparison with ultrasonic measurements shows that the deviation between simulation and experiment remains within a few GPa across all Al-Mg-Zr systems investigated. These potentials also enable the systematic exploration of the Al-Mg-Zr solid solution phase space and provide insights into the elastic behavior as a function of alloying element concentration. Hence, our findings demonstrate the reliability and transferability of the parameterized on-the-fly MLIPs, making them valuable for accelerating the design of Al alloys with tailored physicomechanical properties in complex compositional spaces. While the present study focuses on homogeneous phases, it establishes a foundation for future multiscale simulations that include microstructural features such as precipitates and grain boundaries.

Title: An explicit formula of the Oslo stationary state
Authors: Valentin Lallemant, Vincent Rossetto
Abstract: In most sandpile models under driven-dissipative condition, a critical stationary state is known to emerge. This state displays organization features encoded in the dynamical (e.g. avalanche spectrum) and static (e.g. hyperuniformity) observables. However, the access to the explicit stationary state expression happens only in few cases, and for most sandpile models the question is still open. In this article, we derive such an expression for the Oslo model. To do so, we use different representations of the system configurations and of the dynamical process. Back and forth between these representations allows to tag invariant quantities to each configurations. The stationary probabilities are obtained by summing over all paths leading to a given configuration under the constraint specified by the invariants. This description corresponds exactly to a parametrized path integral formulation in discrete space-time.

Title: An underdog story: Re-emergence of a polar instability at high pressure in KNbO3

Abstract: Ferroelectricity in perovskites is known to be suppressed by a moderate hydrostatic pressure. The notion that a polar instability should reappear in a higher pressure regime is well accepted theoretically but experiments have failed so far to provide a conclusive evidence for it. Here, we investigate a classical but comparatively underlooked ferroelectric perovskite KNbO3. We use single crystal X-ray diffraction, infrared and Raman spectroscopy and second-harmonic generation to explore the phase transition sequence at high pressures up to 63 GPa. We show that the ferroelectric instability manifests itself in the emergence of an incommensurate modulation of the perovskite structure that combines cation displacements and tilts of the oxygen octahedra. Soft modes associated to the tilts and the modulation are clearly observed along with persistent order-disorder signatures. This demonstrates the presence of the high-pressure polar instability in a lead-free perovskite in spite of the centrosymmetric character of all observed high-pressure phases.

Title: Gate reflectometry in a minimal Kitaev chain device
Authors: Yining Zhang, Ivan Kulesh, Sebastiaan L. D. ten Haaf, Nick van Loo, Francesco Zatelli, Tijl Degroote, Christian G. Prosko, Srijit Goswami
Abstract: Hybrid quantum dot (QD)-superconductor system can be used to realize Majorana zero modes in artificial Kitaev chains. These chains provide a promising platform for the realization of Majorana qubits. Radio-frequency (RF) gate reflectometry is a fast, non-invasive, and sensitive technique that can be used to read out such qubits. In this work, we use gate reflectometry to probe two QDs coupled via a semiconductor-superconductor hybrid segment. We demonstrate that gate sensing can resolve charge stability diagrams and clearly distinguish between elastic cotunneling and crossed-Andreev reflection, the two key processes that allow one to form a Kitaev chain. Furthermore, we show that this information is accessible, even when the system is completely decoupled from the from the normal leads. In this closed regime, we show that the observed quantum capacitance signal is indicative of parity switching between the even and odd ground states. Our measurements in both open and closed regimes confirm that gate reflectometry captures the essential features of interdot coupling and parity dynamics.

Title: Programing optical properties of single-walled carbon nanotubes with benzoyl peroxide derivatives of tailored chemical characteristics
Authors: Andrzej Dzienia, Patrycja Taborowska, Pawel Kubica-Cypek, Dawid Janas
Abstract: Semiconducting single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) have great potential for optoelectronics and photonics, further enhanced by covalent functionalization. However, scalable and controlled surface modification is challenging due to complex methodologies and unstable reagents. Benzoyl peroxide (BPO) has emerged as a simple alternative for introducing luminescent defects into SWCNTs. Yet, the lack of understanding of its radical chemistry limits precise defect engineering using BPOs. This is a major obstacle to the effective application of BPO in chemistry, despite its widespread use as a radical initiator. We present a thorough investigation into the radical chemistry of self-synthesized BPOs for functionalizing polymer-wrapped (6,5) and (7,5) SWCNTs in non-polar solvents, providing critical insights into the decomposition of BPO and its analogs. By varying the electronic and steric properties of typically unavailable BPO derivatives, we demonstrate tunability over the photoluminescence characteristics of SWCNTs, allowing control over defect density and light emission wavelength. This toolbox of BPO derivatives, created with simple radical chemistry and accessible organic precursors, alongside clarified structure-property relationships, facilitates effective implementation of BPO in chemical transformations and meticulous engineering of luminescent defects in SWCNTs for optoelectronic applications. Notably, this research offers insights into why SWCNTs modified with electron-deficient reactants provide the best optical characteristics.

Title: Leveraging transfer learning for accurate estimation of ionic migration barriers in solids
Authors: Reshma Devi, Keith T. Butler, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam
Abstract: Ionic mobility determines the rate performance of several applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and electrochemical sensors and is exponentially dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$), a difficult to measure/calculate quantity. Previous approaches to identify materials with high ionic mobility have relied on imprecise descriptors given the lack of generalizable models to predict $E_m$. Here, we present a graph neural network based architecture that leverages principles of transfer learning to efficiently and accurately predict $E_m$ across a diverse set of materials. We use a model pre-trained simultaneously on seven distinct bulk properties (labeled MPT), modify the MPT model to classify different migration pathways in a structure, and fine-tune (FT) on a manually-curated literature-derived dataset of 619 $E_m$ data points calculated with density functional theory. Importantly, our best-performing FT model (labeled MODEL-3) demonstrates substantial improvements in prediction accuracy compared to classical machine learning methods, graph models trained from scratch, and a universal machine learned interatomic potential, with a R$^2$ score of 0.703 and a mean absolute error of 0.261 eV on the test set. Notably, MODEL-3 is able to distinguish different migration pathways within a structure and also demonstrates excellent ability to generalize across intercalant compositions and chemistries. As a classifier, MODEL-3 exhibits 80\% accuracy and 82.8\% precision in identifying materials that are `good' ionic conductors (i.e., structures with $E_m <$0.65~eV). Thus, our work demonstrates the effective use of FT strategies and architectural modifications necessary for making swift and accurate $E_m$ predictions, which will be useful for materials discovery in batteries and for predicting other data-scarce material properties.

Title: Collective heat engines via different interactions: Minimal models, thermodynamics and phase transitions
Authors: Iago N. Mamede, Vitória T. Henkes, Carlos E. Fiore
Abstract: We investigate the dynamics and thermodynamics of a framework composed of interacting units in which parameters (temperatures and energies) assume distinct values due to the contact with distinct (cold and hot) thermal reservoirs. The influence of different ingredients, such as the contact between thermal baths (simultaneous versus not simultaneous contact), the coupling between them (equal or different couplings) and the topology of interactions (all-to-all and local interactions). Closed expressions for transition lines have obtained, expressed by a linear combination of interaction energies times reciprocal temperatures for the simultaneous thermal contact baths and deviates from it when the contact is not simultaneous. The interplay between performance and dissipation is investigated under different conditions, giving rise to a richness of operation regimes, such as heat-engine and heat pump. The relationship between thermodynamic quantities (power, efficiency and dissipation) allows a careful choice of parameters to ensure the desirable compromise between them. Finally, the influence of different interactions energies (Ising, Potts versus Blume-Emery-Griffiths (BEG) like) are investigated, revealing that Potts interactions in general present superior performances than BEG ones.

Title: Multiorbital character of the density wave instability in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$

Abstract: Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates exhibit high-temperature superconductivity closely intertwined with charge and spin density wave order. However, fundamental questions persist regarding the interplay between the associated density wave (DW) fluctuations and superconductivity, as well as the orbital character and symmetry underlying the DW instabilities. Here we utilize polarized Raman scattering to investigate the phononic and electronic Raman responses of the trilayer nickelate La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$ across its concomitant charge and spin density wave transitions. In addition to distinct phonon anomalies occurring below the transition temperature, we observe a depletion of continuum spectral weight up to 114 meV and a pronounced peak centered at this energy. By combining momentum-selective information from polarized electronic Raman scattering with model calculations involving both Ni-3$d_{x^2 - y^2}$ and Ni-3$d_{z^2}$ orbitals, we identify 114 meV as the energy scale $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ of the DW gap, characterized by incoherent opening and non-mean-field behavior. Furthermore, the model calculations reveal that the corresponding $2\Delta_\mathrm{DW}$ peak exhibits a multiorbital origin, thus shedding light on the nature of the DW instabilities in La$_4$Ni$_3$O$_{10}$.

Title: Magnetization-induced reordering of ground states phase diagram in a two-component Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Oskar Stachowiak, Hubert Dunikowski, Emilia Witkowska
Abstract: We investigate the influence of non-zero magnetization on the ground-state phase diagram of the two-component Bose-Hubbard model. Employing a mean-field theoretical framework, both analytically and numerically, we demonstrate that positions and sizes of specific phases on the diagram are magnetization dependent. In particular, non-zero magnetization introduces different Mott insulator phase boundaries for each of the two components. This effect leads to the emergence of a hybrid phase characterized by the coexistence of superfluid in one of the components and Mott insulator in the another one. Our findings highlight the important role of a conserved quantities, which is magnetization here, in reshaping the phase landscape, significantly influencing the stability and emergence of distinct quantum phases.

Title: Comparative study of ensemble-based uncertainty quantification methods for neural network interatomic potentials
Authors: Yonatan Kurniawan (1), Mingjian Wen (2), Ellad B. Tadmor (3), Mark K. Transtrum (1) ((1) Department of Physics and Astronomy, Brigham Young University, Provo, Utah, USA, (2) Institute of Fundamental and Frontier Sciences, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, China, (3) Department of Aerospace Engineering and Mechanics, University of Minnesota, Minneapolis, Minnesota, USA)
Abstract: Machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) enable atomistic simulations with near first-principles accuracy at substantially reduced computational cost, making them powerful tools for large-scale materials modeling. The accuracy of MLIPs is typically validated on a held-out dataset of \emph{ab initio} energies and atomic forces. However, accuracy on these small-scale properties does not guarantee reliability for emergent, system-level behavior -- precisely the regime where atomistic simulations are most needed, but for which direct validation is often computationally prohibitive. As a practical heuristic, predictive precision -- quantified as inverse uncertainty -- is commonly used as a proxy for accuracy, but its reliability remains poorly understood, particularly for system-level predictions. In this work, we systematically assess the relationship between predictive precision and accuracy in both in-distribution (ID) and out-of-distribution (OOD) regimes, focusing on ensemble-based uncertainty quantification methods for neural network potentials, including bootstrap, dropout, random initialization, and snapshot ensembles. We use held-out cross-validation for ID assessment and calculate cold curve energies and phonon dispersion relations for OOD testing. These evaluations are performed across various carbon allotropes as representative test systems. We find that uncertainty estimates can behave counterintuitively in OOD settings, often plateauing or even decreasing as predictive errors grow. These results highlight fundamental limitations of current uncertainty quantification approaches and underscore the need for caution when using predictive precision as a stand-in for accuracy in large-scale, extrapolative applications.

Title: A literature-derived dataset of migration barriers for quantifying ionic transport in battery materials
Authors: Reshma Devi, Avaneesh Balasubramanian, Keith T. Butler, Gopalakrishnan Sai Gautam
Abstract: The rate performance of any electrode or solid electrolyte material used in a battery is critically dependent on the migration barrier ($E_m$) governing the motion of the intercalant ion, which is a difficult-to-estimate quantity both experimentally and computationally. The foundation for constructing and validating accurate machine learning (ML) models that are capable of predicting $E_m$, and hence accelerating the discovery of novel electrodes and solid electrolytes, lies in the availability of high-quality dataset(s) containing $E_m$. Addressing this critical requirement, we present a comprehensive dataset comprising 619 distinct literature-reported $E_m$ values calculated using density functional theory based nudged elastic band computations, across 443 compositions and 27 structural groups consisting of various compounds that have been explored as electrodes or solid electrolytes in batteries. Our dataset includes compositions that correspond to fully charged and/or discharged states of electrode materials, with intermediate compositions incorporated in select instances. Crucially, for each compound, our dataset provides structural information, including the initial and final positions of the migrating ion, along with its corresponding $E_m$ in easy-to-use .xlsx and JSON formats. We envision our dataset to be a highly useful resource for the scientific community, facilitating the development of advanced ML models that can predict $E_m$ precisely and accelerate materials discovery.

Title: Spontaneous Hole Formation in Cell Monolayers Emerges from Collective Cell Motion
Authors: Diogo E. P. Pinto, Jan Rozman, Julia M. Yeomans
Abstract: Although cell monolayers typically remain confluent, they can spontaneously develop persistent holes as a result of collective cellular motion. Recent studies on MDCK monolayers cultured on soft substrates have revealed that cells can align to create regions of local nematic order, and topological defects that generate localised mechanical stresses which can spontaneously trigger hole formation. To investigate this process, we develop a continuum multi-phase field model that incorporates internal dissipation and active dipolar forces that drive cell shape anisotropy. Our simulations show that reducing substrate friction enhances cell-cell velocity correlations. In this low-friction regime, topological defects give rise to spiral flow patterns that concentrate stress and can trigger hole formation. We further demonstrate that the number and stability of the holes, whether they close or persist, depends on both substrate friction and cellular activity. These findings underscore the critical role of collective cell dynamics in maintaining tissue integrity.

Title: Observation of momentum dependent charge density wave gap in EuTe4

Abstract: The occurrence of charge density wave (CDW) phenomena, particularly in low dimensional rare-earth chalcogenides, has attracted substantial research interest. Among these materials, EuTe4, which features multiple Te layers and a single Eu-Te layer, serves as a promising platform to study the interplay between CDW order and 4f electron configurations, including magnetism. In this study, First principles based density functional theory (DFT) calculations were carried out to investigate the electronic band structure modifications arising from CDW modulation. Angle resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) revealed the emergence of a CDW gap at the Fermi level, as well as hybridization induced gap features at lower binding energies. The low lying CDW gap reaches its maximum along the Gamma-Y high-symmetry direction and a minimum along GX reflecting the anisotropic nature of the electronic structure. We also performed low temperature heat capacity measurements in applied magnetic fields near the Neel temperature (TN ~ 6.9 K) to construct the magnetic phase diagram of EuTe4. This study provides valuable insight into the directional dependent evolution of the Fermi surface nesting induced CDW ordering, along with other observed gap openings within this system.

Title: Simulating Floquet non-Abelian topological insulator with photonic quantum walks
Authors: Quan Lin, Tianyu Li, Haiping Hu, Wei Yi, Peng Xue
Abstract: Floquet non-Abelian topological phases emerge in periodically driven systems and exhibit properties that are absent in their Abelian or static counterparts. Dubbed the Floquet non-Abelian topological insulators (FNATIs), they are characterized by non-Abelian topological charges and feature multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, making their experimental observation challenging. Here we simulate the FNATI using a higher-dimensional photonic quantum walk and develop dynamic measurement schemes to demonstrate key signatures of the FNATI. Importantly, combining a direct bulk-dynamic detection for the underlying quaternion topological charge, and a spatially-resolved injection spectroscopy for the edge states, we experimentally establish the multifold bulk-boundary correspondence, and, in particular, identify the anomalous non-Abelian phase where edge states appear in all band gaps, despite the presence of a trivial topological charge. Our experiment marks the first experimental characterization of the FNATI, providing general insight into the non-Abelian topological phases.

Title: Fate of an impurity strongly interacting with a thermal Bose gas
Authors: Jiří Etrych, Sebastian J. Morris, Simon M. Fischer, Gevorg Martirosyan, Christopher J. Ho, Moritz Drescher, Manfred Salmhofer, Zoran Hadzibabic, Tilman Enss, Christoph Eigen
Abstract: We spectroscopically study mobile impurities immersed in a homogeneous bosonic bath (a box-trapped Bose gas), varying the bath temperature and the strength of impurity-bath interactions. We compare our results to those for a quasipure Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC), and find that for strong impurity-bath interactions, the spectra narrow with increasing temperature, while the impurity energy shift is suppressed. Near the critical temperature for condensation, many-body effects still play an important role, and only for a nondegenerate bath, the system approaches the classical Boltzmann-gas behavior. The key spectral features are reproduced within the theory of an ideal Bose polaron.

Title: Control of dynamical localization in atom-optics kicked rotor
Authors: S. Sagar Maurya, S. Bharathi Kannan, Kushal Patel, Pranab Dutta, Korak Biswas, Jay Mangaonkar, M. S. Santhanam, Umakant D. Rapol
Abstract: Atom-optics kicked rotor represents an experimentally realizable version of the paradigmatic quantum kicked rotor system. After a short initial diffusive phase the cloud settles down to a stationary state due to the onset of dynamical localization. In this work we realise an enhancement of localization by modification of the kick sequence. We experimentally implement the modification to this system in which the sign of the kick sequence is flipped by allowing for a free evolution of the wavepackets for half the Talbot time after every $M$ kicks. Depending on the value of $M$, this modified system displays a combination of enhanced diffusion followed by asymptotic localization. This is explained as resulting from two competing processes -- localization induced by standard kicked rotor type kicks, and diffusion induced by half Talbot time evolution. The evolving states display a localized but non-exponential wave function profiles. This provides another route to quantum control in kicked rotor class of systems. The numerical simulations agree well with the experimental results.

Title: A device-level compact model for mushroom-type phase change memory
Authors: Stephan Menzel, Benedikt Kersting, Rana Walied Ahmad, Abu Sebastian, Ghazi Sarwat Syed
Abstract: In this work we introduce a compact model for mushroom-type phase-change memory devices that incorporates the shape and size of the amorphous mark under different programming conditions, and is applicable to both projecting and non-projecting devices. The model includes analytical equations for the amorphous and crystalline regions and uniquely features a current leakage path that injects current at the outer edge of the electrodes. The results demonstrate that accurately modeling the size and shape of the phase configurations is crucial for predicting the full-span of the RESET and SET programming, including the characteristics of threshold switching. Additionally, the model effectively captures read-out behaviors, including the dependence of resistance drift and bipolar current asymmetry behaviours on the phase configurations. The compact model is also provided in Verilog-A format, so it can be easily used in standard circuit-level simulation tools.

Title: Single-Shot Multispectral Encoding: Advancing Optical Lithography for Encryption and Spectroscopy
Authors: Hyewon Shim, Geonwoong Park, Hyunsuk Yun, Sunmin Ryu, Yong-Young Noh, Cheol-Joo Kim
Abstract: Most modern optical display and sensing devices utilize a limited number of spectral units within the visible range, based on human color perception. In contrast, the rapid advancement of machine-based pattern recognition and spectral analysis could facilitate the use of multispectral functional units, yet the challenge of creating complex, high-definition, and reproducible patterns with an increasing number of spectral units limits their widespread application. Here, we report a technique for optical lithography that employs a single-shot exposure to reproduce perovskite films with spatially controlled optical band gaps through light-induced compositional modulations. Luminescent patterns are designed to program correlations between spatial and spectral information, covering the entire visible spectral range. Using this platform, we demonstrate multispectral encoding patterns for encryption and multivariate optical converters for dispersive optics-free spectroscopy with high spectral resolution. The fabrication process is conducted at room temperature and can be extended to other material and device platforms.

Title: On the Determination of Collisional Stopping Power via Kaluza-Klein Theory
Authors: Seyda Elife Gönül, Huriye Gürsel
Abstract: In this work, the tools of general relativity are used to analytically derive collisional stopping power. We start from a Kaluza-Klein inspired, five-dimensional diffeomorphism-invariant action, and upon compactification, obtain a four-dimensional effective theory in which the matter fields are treated to be brane-localized. The medium response to the projected electron is encoded in symmetric tensor fields coupled covariantly to both electromagnetic and fermionic parts via Lagrangian-derived interactions. When $R_c \sim \Lambda_{\text{EM}}^{-1}$, $\Lambda_{\text{EM}} \gg m_e$ and $g_4^2 = \frac{3\pi^2 m_e v}{4\gamma^3 R_c^2 e^2 \Lambda_{\text{EM}}}$ are satisfied, the leading term of Bethe-Moller formula is shown to be recovered in the large $R'$ limit. The construction presented here may serve as an alternative approach that uses compactification geometry and medium excitations to determine observable couplings and stopping power. The model intrinsically supports phenomena linked to anisotropy and nonlinear response, as well as gravitational or extra-dimensional effects in laboratory-scale systems via the study of stopping power and particle range.

Title: Role of Plaquette Term in Genuine $2+1$D String Dynamics on Quantum Simulators

Abstract: With the advent of quantum simulators of $2+1$D lattice gauge theories (LGTs), a fundamental open question is under what circumstances the observed physics is genuinely $2+1$D rather than effectively $1+1$D. Here, we address this question in the ongoing strong effort to quantum-simulate string dynamics in $2+1$D LGTs on state-of-the-art quantum hardware. Through tensor network simulations and analytic derivations, we show that the plaquette term, which represents a magnetic field and only emerges in $d>1$ spatial dimensions, plays a crucial role in \textit{genuine} $2+1$D string dynamics deep in the confined regime. In its absence and for minimal-length (Manhattan-distance) strings, we demonstrate how string breaking, although on a lattice in $d=2$ spatial dimensions, can be effectively mapped to a $1+1$D dynamical process independently of lattice geometry. Our findings not only answer the question of what qualifies as genuine $2+1$D string dynamics, but also serve as a clear guide for future quantum simulation experiments of $2+1$D LGTs.

Title: A quantum computing approach to efficiently simulating correlated materials using impurity models and dynamical mean field theory
Authors: Norman Hogan, Efekan Kökcü, Thomas Steckmann, Liam P. Doak, Carlos Mejuto-Zaera, Daan Camps, Roel Van Beeumen, Wibe A. de Jong, A. F. Kemper
Abstract: The accurate theoretical description of materials with strongly correlated electrons is a formidable challenge, at the forefront of condensed matter physics and computational chemistry alike, and it is one of the targets for quantum computing. Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) is a successful approach that predicts behaviors of such systems by incorporating some correlated behavior, but it is limited by the need to calculate the Green's function for the impurity model. This work proposes a framework for DMFT calculations on quantum computers, focusing on near-term applications. It leverages the structure of the impurity problem, combining a low-rank Gaussian subspace representation of the ground state and a compressed, short-depth quantum circuit that joins the Gaussian state preparation with the time evolution to compute the necessary Green's functions. We demonstrate the convergence of the DMFT algorithm using the Gaussian subspace in a noise-free setting, and show the hardware viability of the circuit compression by extracting the impurity Green's function on IBM quantum processors for a single impurity coupled to three bath orbitals (8 physical qubits and 1 ancilla). We discuss the potential paths forward towards realizing this use case of quantum computing in materials science.

Title: Generalized Holstein-Primakoff mapping and $1/N$ expansion of collective spin systems undergoing single particle dissipation
Authors: Diego Barberena
Abstract: We develop a generalization of the Schwinger boson and Holstein-Primakoff transformations that is applicable to ensembles of $N$ spin $1/2$'s with weak permutational symmetry. These generalized mappings are constructed by introducing two independent bosonic variables that describe fluctuations parallel and transverse to the collective Bloch vector built out of the original spin $1/2$'s. Using this representation, we develop a systematic $1/N$ expansion and write down explicitly leading and next-to-leading order terms. We then illustrate how to apply these techniques using four example systems: (i) an ensemble of atoms undergoing spontaneous emission, incoherent pumping and single particle dephasing; (ii) a superradiant laser above and in the vicinity of the upper lasing transition; (iii) the all-to-all transverse field Ising model subject to incoherent pumping in the vicinity of its ordering phase transition; and (iv) the Dicke model at finite temperature both away and in the vicinity of its thermal phase transition. Thus, these mappings provide a common, Bloch-sphere based, geometrical description of all-to-all systems subject to single particle dissipation or at finite temperature, including their phase transitions.

Title: A spin-embedded diamond optomechanical resonator with mechanical quality factor exceeding one million

Abstract: Diamond optomechanical crystal (OMC) devices with embedded color center spins are promising platforms for a broad range of applications in quantum sensing, networking, and computing applications, offering an interface between a GHz-frequency mechanical mode and both optical photons and coherent spins. A crucial but elusive step towards realizing this platform is to engineer a device with a high-quality factor mechanical mode while preserving the bulk-like coherence of embedded spins. Here we demonstrate sideband-resolved diamond OMCs with mechanical quality factors in excess of $10^6$ at cryogenic temperatures, and find coherence times up to $T_2$ = 270 $\mu$s for embedded nitrogen vacancy (NV) centers. Furthermore, we measure these devices across five orders of magnitude in intracavity optical power, demonstrating robust power handling and a high optomechanical cooperativity ($C\gg1$) at cryogenic temperatures that is essential for a broad range of quantum protocols requiring strong, coherent interactions between photons and phonons. These results are enabled by a robust, high-throughput method for forming single-crystal diamond membranes in combination with chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond overgrowth with nitrogen $\delta$-doping. We discuss the prospects of this platform for hybrid spin-mechanical devices in the quantum regime.

Title: Low-dimensional magnetocaloric materials for energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration: Does size matter?
Authors: Nguyen Thi My Duc, Hariharan Srikanth, Manh-Huong Phan
Abstract: The magnetocaloric effect (MCE) provides a promising foundation for the development of solid-state refrigeration technologies that could replace conventional gas compression-based cooling systems. Current research efforts primarily focus on identifying cost-effective magnetic materials that exhibit large MCEs under low magnetic fields across broad temperature ranges, thereby enhancing cooling efficiency. However, practical implementation of magnetic refrigeration requires more than bulk materials; real-world devices demand efficient thermal management and compact, scalable architectures, often achieved through laminate designs or miniaturized geometries. Magnetocaloric materials with reduced dimensionality, such as ribbons, thin films, microwires, and nanostructures, offer distinct advantages, including improved heat exchange, mechanical flexibility, and integration potential. Despite these benefits, a comprehensive understanding of how size, geometry, interfacial effects, strain, and surface phenomena influence the MCE remains limited. This review aims to address these knowledge gaps and provide guidance for the rational design and engineering of magnetocaloric materials tailored for high-performance, energy-efficient magnetic refrigeration systems.

Title: Light-Addressable Smart Nanostructures via Resonant Nanoheating
Authors: Victor Tabouillot, Douglas Murad, Rahul Kumar, Paula L. Lalaguna, Maryam Hajji, Affar Karimullah, Nikolaj Gadegaard, Aurélie Malfait, Patrice Woisel, Graeme Cooke, Malcolm Kadodwala
Abstract: Selective spatial control of chemical reactions at the level of individual nanostructures remains a significant challenge. We introduce a light-activated system that combines plasmonic gold nanorods with a poly(N-isopropylacrylamide) monolayer to gate surface reactivity based on each rod's geometry under optical illumination. Laser excitation tuned to a rod's plasmon resonance and polarization collapses the polymer into a compact shell on that rod, blocking reactive head groups and creating a long-lived, kinetically trapped inert state stable for days. During this interval, orthogonal chemical transformations can be performed on adjacent, unilluminated rods without interference. Subsequent diffusion-limited rehydration restores the swollen brush conformation and renews surface activity, effectively erasing the chemical memory. Numerical simulations based on real nanorod geometries confirm that switching selectivity follows the rods' absorption profiles. This mask-free, fully reversible strategy turns passive polymer films into dynamic chemical interfaces, offering a route to high-resolution patterning and on-demand control of nanoscale reactions for electronic and sensing applications.

Title: Low dimensional dynamics of a sparse balanced synaptic network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons
Authors: Maria V. Ageeva, Denis S. Goldobin
Abstract: Kinetics of a balanced network of neurons with a sparse grid of synaptic links is well representable by the stochastic dynamics of a generic neuron subject to an effective shot noise. The rate of delta-pulses of the noise is determined self-consistently from the probability density of the neuron states. Importantly, the most sophisticated (but robust) collective regimes of the network do not allow for the diffusion approximation, which is routinely adopted for a shot noise in mathematical neuroscience. These regimes can be expected to be biologically relevant. For the kinetics equations of the complete mean field theory of a homogeneous inhibitory network of quadratic integrate-and-fire neurons, we introduce circular cumulants of the genuine phase variable and derive a rigorous two cumulant reduction for both time-independent conditions and modulation of the excitatory current. The low dimensional model is examined with numerical simulations and found to be accurate for time-independent states and dynamic response to a periodic modulation deep into the parameter domain where the diffusion approximation is not applicable. The accuracy of a low dimensional model indicates and explains a low embedding dimensionality of the macroscopic collective dynamics of the network. The reduced model can be instrumental for theoretical studies of inhibitory-excitatory balances neural networks.

Title: Shortcuts to adiabaticity with a quantum control field
Authors: Emma C. King, Giovanna Morigi, Raphaël Menu
Abstract: Quantum adiabatic dynamics is the crucial element of adiabatic quantum computing and quantum annealing. Shortcuts to adiabaticity enable acceleration of the computational time by suppressing unwanted non-adiabatic processes with designed classical fields. Here, we consider quantum state transfer in the Landau-Zener model, which exemplifies the key elements of quantum adiabatic dynamics. We argue that non-adiabatic transitions can be suppressed by autonomous quantum dynamics, which involves coupling the Landau-Zener qubit to a second quantum system. By tuning the coupling strength, the composite quantum dynamics can reduce the probability of unwanted processes by more than two orders of magnitude. This is a prime example of control where the quantum properties of the control fields are key for implementing shortcuts to adiabaticity.

Title: Epidemic threshold and localization of the SIS model on directed complex networks
Authors: Vinícius B. Müller, Fernando L. Metz
Abstract: We study the susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model on directed complex networks within the quenched mean-field approximation. Combining results from random matrix theory with an analytic approach to the distribution of fixed-point infection probabilities, we derive the phase diagram and show that the model exhibits a nonequilibrium phase transition between the absorbing and endemic phases for $c \geq \lambda^{-1}$, where $c$ is the mean degree and $\lambda$ the average infection rate. Interestingly, the critical line is independent of the degree distribution but is highly sensitive to the form of the infection-rate distribution. We further show that the inverse participation ratio of infection probabilities diverges near the epidemic threshold, indicating that the disease may become localized on a small fraction of nodes. These results provide a comprehensive picture of how network heterogeneities shape epidemic spreading on directed contact networks.

Title: Template masks for 4D-STEM
Authors: Yining Xie, Eoin Moynihan, Marin Alexe, Louis Piper, Ana Sanchez, Richard Beanland
Abstract: We present a new analysis method for atomic resolution four-dimensional scanning transmission electron microscopy (4D-STEM, in which a diffraction pattern is collected at each point of a raster scan of a focused electron beam across the specimen). In 4D-STEM, each measured intensity has a dual character, forming a pixel in a diffraction pattern and, equally, forming a pixel in a STEM image. Applying a mask to the data to obtain a "virtual" bright field or dark field image is widely used and understood. However, there is a complementary procedure, in which an image (template) is applied to the data to obtain a mask. This mask shows the correlation between the data and the template and, when applied to atomic resolution 4D-STEM data produces an image optimised for the template. This allows, for example, imaging of specific atom columns and is a significant improvement over user-defined masks such as virtual annular bright field imaging. We demonstrate the capability of the approach, separately imaging Li and O atom columns in LiFePO4 and O, Pb and Ti across a domain wall in this http URL template masks provide a computationally straightforward and general method to probe 4D-STEM data. They are particularly effective for specimens of moderate thickness where multiple scattering produces strong and specific correlations in diffraction patterns.

Title: The convex structure of the Parisi formula for multi-species spin glasses
Authors: Hong-Bin Chen, Victor Issa, Jean-Christophe Mourrat
Abstract: We study the free energy of mean-field multi-species spin glasses with convex covariance function. For such models with $D$ species, the Parisi formula is known to be valid, and expresses the limit free energy as a supremum over monotone probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$. We show here that one can transform this representation into a supremum over all probability measures on $\mathbb{R}_+^D$ of a concave functional. We then deduce that the Parisi formula admits a unique maximizer. Using convex-duality arguments, we also obtain a new representation of the free energy as an infimum over martingales in a Wiener space.

Title: 4D operando X-ray nano-holo-tomography reveals multiscale chemomechanics in Silicon-Graphite anode
Authors: Victor Vanpeene, Olga Stamati, Francois Cadiou, Quentin Jacquet, Julie Villanova, Sandrine Lyonnard
Abstract: Linking electrode microstructure to electrochemical performance is essential for optimizing Li-ion batteries. However, this requires mechanistic 4D observations at ultimate spatio-temporal scales, which remains elusive. Here we demonstrate the use of operando synchrotron X-ray nano-holo-tomography combined with Digital Volume Correlation to track chemomechanical dynamics at both particle (local) and electrode (averaged) scales. Quantitative scale-bridging image analysis is applied to a high-capacity silicon-graphite anode during its formation cycle. Our findings reveal that local diffusion properties, graphite particle morphology and position in the electrode, distance to silicon clusters, surface contact with electrolyte and mechanical deformations, all have a direct impact on the local electrochemical activity and irreversibility - but these parameters are not equally important. Particularly, we identify fast diffusion channels that play a key role and counterbalance intrinsic depth-dependent reaction heterogeneities due to ionic/electronic diffusion limitations. The various structural factors that determine Gr-Si battery performance beyond ensemble properties are classified using a scale of influence, providing a practical framework for the optimization of materials and electrode manufacturing.

Title: Nonreciprocal and Geometric Frustration in Dissipative Quantum Spins
Authors: Guitao Lyu, Myung-Joong Hwang
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions often create conflicting dynamical objectives that cannot be simultaneously satisfied, leading to nonreciprocal frustration. On the other hand, geometric frustration arises when conflicting static objectives in energy minimization cannot be satisfied. In this work, we show that nonreciprocal interaction among three collective quantum spins, mediated by a damped cavity, induces not only nonreciprocal frustration, intrinsic to nonreciprocity, but also geometric frustration with a remarkable robustness against disorder. It therefore ensures that the accidental degeneracy for steady states remains intact even when the system is perturbed away from a fine-tuned point of enhanced symmetry, in sharp contrast to the equilibrium case. Leveraging this finding, we identify a nonreciprocal phase transition driven by both geometric and nonreciprocal frustration. It gives rise to a time-dependent state, which shows a chiral dynamics along a geometry shaped by the geometric frustration and dynamically restores the broken discrete symmetries. Moreover, it constitutes a time-crystalline order, with multiple harmonics set by an emergent time scale that exhibits critical slowing down. Our predictions have important physical implications for a three-component spinor BEC-cavity system, which manifest as a geometric frustration in the structural phase transition and chiral dynamics of the frustrated self-organized BECs. We demonstrate the feasibility of experimental observation despite the presence of disorder in the spin-cavity coupling strengths.

Title: Round Aztec windows, a dual of the Aztec diamond theorem and a curious symmetry of the correlation of diagonal slits
Authors: Mihai Ciucu
Abstract: Fairly shortly after the publication of the Aztec diamond theorem of Elkies, Kuperberg, Larsen and Propp in 1992, interest arose in finding the number of domino tilings of an Aztec diamond with an ``Aztec window,'' i.e.\ a hole in the shape of a smaller Aztec diamond at its center. Several intriguing patterns were discovered for the number of tilings of such regions, but the numbers themselves were not ``round'' -- they didn't seem to be given by a simple product formula. In this paper we consider a very closely related shape of holes (namely, odd Aztec rectangles), and prove that a large variety of regions obtained from Aztec rectangles by making such holes in them possess the sought-after property that the number of their domino tilings is given by a simple product formula. We find the same to be true for certain symmetric cruciform regions. We also consider graphs obtained from a toroidal Aztec diamond by making such holes in them, and prove a simple formula that governs the way the number of their perfect matchings changes under a natural evolution of the holes. This yields in particular a natural dual of the Aztec diamond theorem. Some implications for the correlation of such holes are also presented, including an unexpected symmetry for the correlation of diagonal slits on the square grid.

Title: Intuition emerges in Maximum Caliber models at criticality
Authors: Lluís Arola-Fernández
Abstract: Whether large predictive models merely parrot their training data or produce genuine insight lacks a physical explanation. This work reports a primitive form of intuition that emerges as a metastable phase of learning that critically balances next-token prediction against future path-entropy. The intuition mechanism is discovered via mind-tuning, the minimal principle that imposes Maximum Caliber in predictive models with a control temperature-like parameter $\lambda$. Training on random walks in deterministic mazes reveals a rich phase diagram: imitation (low $\lambda$), rule-breaking hallucination (high $\lambda$), and a fragile in-between window exhibiting strong protocol-dependence (hysteresis) and multistability, where models spontaneously discover novel goal-directed strategies. These results are captured by an effective low-dimensional theory and frame intuition as an emergent property at the critical balance between memorizing what is and wondering what could be.

Title: Scaling Laws of Magnetically Driven High-order Harmonic Generation in Spin-Orbit Coupled Systems
Authors: Ousmane Ly
Abstract: We investigate the scaling behavior of high harmonic generation (HHG) driven by magnetic dynamics in spin-orbit coupled systems. In contrast to optically driven HHG--where the harmonic cutoff scales as $\omega^{-3}$ with the driving frequency $\omega$--our time-dependent quantum transport simulations reveal a qualitatively distinct scaling law for magnetically driven HHG in the presence of Rashba spin-orbit interaction: the harmonic cutoff $n_{\mathrm{max}}$ scales as $\omega^{-1}$. This fundamental difference arises from distinct excitation mechanisms--namely, spin-flip transitions driven by vectorial magnetic precession, as opposed to scalar electric fields. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the precession cone angle $\theta$ serves as a crucial control parameter. Increasing $\theta$ broadens the harmonic bandwidth, with peak emission achieved for nearly in-plane magnetic dynamics. Our findings establish magnetically driven HHG as a robust and tunable mechanism for nonlinear spin transport, governed by unique scaling laws with potential applications in ultrafast spintronic technologies.

Title: Micellization in active matter of asymmetric self-propelled particles: Experiments

Abstract: Active matter composed of self-propelled particles features fascinating self-organization phenomena, spanning from motility-induced phase separation to phototaxis to topological excitations depending on the nature and parameters of the system. In the present paper, we consider micelle formation by active particles with a broken symmetry having a circular back and a sharpened nose toward which the particles accelerate. As we demonstrate in experiments with robotic swarms, such particles can either remain in the isotropic phase or form micelles depending on the location of their center of inertia, in accordance with a recent theoretical proposal [T. Kruglov and A. Borisov, Presentations and Videos to 7th Edition of the International Conference on Particle-based Methods (2021), Vol. CT07, p. 2]. Such a behavior is observed for both nonchiral particles moving linearly and placed in a parabolic potential and for chiral particles moving along circular trajectories on a flat surface. By performing experiments with single robots and two-robot collisions, we unveil that the observed emergence of micellization associated with shifting robots' center of inertia towards their noses is governed by at least two-particle effects, in particular, by a difference in the formation of stable two-robot clusters. Finally, we consider the dependence of micelle lifetime and formation probability as well as two-robot collisions on friction between the lateral surfaces of the robots. Crucially, the predicted micellization does not involve any solvation shells that give rise to the micellization of surfactants but is instead driven by an interplay of activity and particle shape asymmetry.

Title: Description length of canonical and microcanonical models
Authors: Francesca Giuffrida, Tiziano Squartini, Peter Grünwald, Diego Garlaschelli
Abstract: The (non-)equivalence of canonical and microcanonical ensembles is a fundamental question in statistical physics, concerning whether the use of soft and hard constraints in the maximum-entropy construction leads to the same description of a system. Despite the fact that maximum-entropy models are also commonly used in statistical inference, pattern detection, and hypothesis testing, a complete understanding of the effects of ensemble non-equivalence on statistical modeling is still missing. Here, we study this problem from a rigorous model selection perspective by comparing canonical and microcanonical models via the Minimum Description Length (MDL) principle, which yields a trade-off between likelihood, measuring model accuracy, and complexity, measuring model flexibility and its potential to overfit data. We compute the Normalized Maximum Likelihood (NML) of both formulations and find that: (i) microcanonical models always achieve higher likelihood but are always more complex; (ii) the optimal model choice depends on the empirical values of the constraints -- the canonical model performs best when its fit to the observed data exceeds its uniform average fit across all realizations; (iii) in the thermodynamic limit, the difference in description length per node vanishes when ensemble equivalence holds but persists otherwise, showing that non-equivalence implies extensive differences between large canonical and microcanonical models. Finally, we compare the NML approach to Bayesian methods, showing that (iv) the choice of priors, practically irrelevant in equivalent models, becomes crucial when an extensive number of constraints is enforced, possibly leading to very different outcomes.

Title: Machine learning of kinetic energy densities with target and feature averaging: better results with fewer training data
Authors: Sergei Manzhos, Johann Lüder, Manabu Ihara
Abstract: Machine learning of kinetic energy functionals (KEF), in particular kinetic energy density (KED) functionals, has recently attracted attention as a promising way to construct KEFs for orbital-free density functional theory (OF-DFT). Neural networks (NN) and kernel methods including Gaussian process regression (GPR) have been used to learn Kohn-Sham (KS) KED from density-based descriptors derived from KS DFT calculations. The descriptors are typically expressed as functions of different powers and derivatives of the electron density. This can generate large and extremely unevenly distributed datasets, which complicates effective application of machine learning techniques. Very uneven data distributions require many training data points, can cause overfitting, and ultimately lower the quality of a ML KED model. We show that one can produce more accurate ML models from fewer data by working with partially averaged density-dependent variables and KED. Averaging palliates the issue of very uneven data distributions and associated difficulties of sampling, while retaining enough spatial structure necessary for working within the paradigm of KEDF. We use GPR as a function of partially spatially averaged terms of the 4th order gradient expansion and the Kohn-Sham effective potential and obtain accurate and stable (with respect to different random choices of training points) kinetic energy models for Al, Mg, and Si simultaneously from as few as 2000 samples (about 0.3% of the total KS DFT data). In particular, accuracies on the order of 1% in a measure of the quality of energy-volume dependence B' = \frac{E(V_0-\Delta V)-2E(V_0)+E(V_0 + \Delta V)}{\big(\frac{\Delta V}{V_0}\big)^2} are obtained simultaneously for all three materials.

Title: The Fluctuation-Dissipation Relations: Growth, Diffusion, and Beyond

Abstract: In this review, we scrutinize historical and modern results on the linear response of dynamical systems to external perturbations with a particular emphasis on the celebrated relationship between fluctuations and dissipation expressed by the fluctuation-dissipation theorem (FDT). The conceptual foundation of FDT originates from the definition of the equilibrium state and Onsager's regression hypothesis. Over time, the fluctuation-dissipation relation has been vividly investigated also in systems far from equilibrium, which often exhibit wild fluctuations in measured parameters. In this review, we recall the major formulations of the FDT, including those proposed by Langevin, Onsager and Kubo. We discuss the role of fluctuations in a broad class of growth and diffusion phenomena and examine the violation of the FDT resulting from a transition from Euclidean to fractal geometry. Finally, we highlight possible generalizations of the FDT formalism and discuss situations where the relation breaks down and is no longer applicable.

Title: Bipartite Fluctuations of Critical Fermi Surfaces
Authors: Xiao-Chuan Wu
Abstract: Fluctuations of conserved quantities within a subsystem are non-local observables that provide unique insights into quantum many-body systems. In this paper, we study bipartite charge (and spin) fluctuations across interaction-driven ``metal-insulator transitions'' out of Landau Fermi liquids. The ``charge insulators'' include a class of non-Fermi-liquid states of fractionalized degrees of freedom, such as compressible composite Fermi liquids (for spinless electrons) and incompressible spin-liquid Mott insulators (for spin-$1/2$ electrons). We find that charge fluctuations $F$ exhibit distinct leading-order scalings across the transition: $F \sim L\log(L)$ in Landau Fermi liquids and $F \sim L$ in charge insulators, where $L$ is the linear size of the subsystem. In composite Fermi liquids, under certain conditions, we also identify a universal constant term $-f(\theta)|\sigma_{xy}|/(2\pi)$ when the subsystem geometry contains a sharp corner, where $f(\theta)$ denotes a function of the corner angle, and $\sigma_{xy}$ is the Hall conductivity. At the critical point, provided the transition is continuous, the leading scaling $F\sim L$ is accompanied by a subleading universal corner contribution $-\log(L)f(\theta)C_{\rho}/2$ with the same angle dependence $f(\theta)$, and the universal coefficient $C_{\rho}$ is directly related to the predicted universal jumps in longitudinal and Hall resistivities. These results establish fluctuation-transport relations, paving the way for numerical and experimental studies of unconventional quantum criticalities in metals.

Title: Charge ordering and spontaneous topological Hall effect in bilayer skyrmion crystals
Authors: Andrew Hardy, Anjishnu Bose, Tanmay Grover, Arun Paramekanti
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmion crystals with zero net skyrmion charge and zero topological Hall response are interesting candidate phases which can occur at a vanishing magnetic field in centrosymmetric systems. We study a minimal bilayer model of skyrmion crystals having opposite chirality and topological charge in the two layers, and show that it can host nearly flat electronic bands with quasi-uniform Berry curvature and quantum metric. Using Hartree-Fock theory, we show that weak to moderate short-range electron interactions induce two distinct types of symmetry breaking patterns depending on the band dispersion: an intra-unit-cell charge density modulation from Chern band mixing or a layer-imbalanced phase with a nonzero ferroelectric polarization. Both phases break inversion symmetry leading to a spontaneous and large net topological Hall effect, with the phase diagram tunable by external electric fields. Our results may be relevant to centrosymmetric skyrmion materials such as Gd$_2$PdSi$_3$ and Gd$_3$Ru$_4$Al$_{12}$ as well as artificially engineered heterostructures. We also discuss its relation to recent work on twisted transition metal dichalcogenide bilayers.

Title: Specific heat of Gd$^{3+}$ and Eu$^{2+}$-based magnetic compounds
Authors: D. J. Garcia, J. G. Sereni, A. A. Aligia
Abstract: We have studied theoretically the specific heat of a large number of non-frustrated magnetic structures described by the Heisenberg model for systems with total angular momentum $J=7/2$, corresponding to the 4f$^7$ configuration of Gd$^{+3}$ and Eu$^{+2}$. For a given critical temperature (determined by the magnitude of the exchange interactions), we find that, to a high degree of accuracy, the specific heat is governed by two primary parameters: the effective number of neighbors, which dictates the extent of quantum fluctuations, and the axial anisotropy. Using these two parameters we fit the specific heat of four Gd compounds and two Eu compounds, achieving a remarkable agreement. Our work opens the possibility of describing the specific heat of 4f$^7$ systems within a general framework.

Title: Phase-field model of alloy solidification far from chemical equilibrium at the solid-liquid interface
Authors: Kaihua Ji, Mingwang Zhong, Alain Karma
Abstract: We further develop a recently introduced phase-field model of rapid alloy solidification [Ji et al., PRL 2023]. This model utilizes enhanced solute diffusivity within the spatially diffuse interface region to quantitatively capture solute trapping with a larger interface width, thereby making simulations on experimentally relevant length and time scales computationally feasible. The main developments presented here include testing the robustness of different variational formulations, extending the model to concentrated alloys by incorporating solid and liquid free energies from thermodynamic databases, as illustrated for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys with CALPHAD, extending convergence tests as a function of interface width to 3D, and carrying out simulations in both 2D and 3D to examine existing theories of microstructure development. Our results indicate that the simplest variational formulation that interpolates the bulk free-energy density between its solid and liquid forms is the most robust. Remarkably, for hypoeutectic Al-Ag alloys, this formulation yields a high-velocity nonequilibrium phase diagram that is independent of interface width, thereby demonstrating that the framework of enhanced solute diffusivity can be non-trivially extended to concentrated alloys. Other variational formulations have restricted ranges of materials or processing parameters that can be reliably modeled. We use 2D simulations to construct high-velocity microstructure selection maps for dilute Al-Cu alloys. Furthermore, 3D simulations demonstrate a good convergence similar to that observed in 2D as a function of interface width. Full 3D simulations reveal that the standard theory of absolute stability is a good predictor of the upper critical velocity beyond which steady-state growth becomes unstable, despite the different morphological manifestations of this instability in 2D and 3D.

Title: Predicted versatile topological nodal magnons in Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants
Authors: Rintaro Eto, Masahito Mochizuki, Shinji Watanabe
Abstract: Using a recently-established band representation analysis, we discover two distinct types of topological nodal magnons in the real-space antiferroic ordering of whirling spin arrangements in the Tb-based icosahedral quasicrystal 1/1 approximants, both of which originate from a composite band (co-)representation $A\uparrow P_In\bar{3}(24)$ and its constituent elementary band representations. The first type is doubly-degenerate nodal line network and nodal planes associated with two-dimensional irreducible band representation, while the second type is a nodal line network due to accidental band inversions. Since our analysis, which relies solely on magnetocrystalline symmetry, is valid for a wide range of materials and spin textures belonging to the same magnetic space group irrespective of composition, these findings offer new universal insights into the research of Tb-based quasicrystal approximants as well as a contribution to broadening the range of topological magnon-hosting materials.

Title: Coulomb-driven Momentum Space Condensation in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Erin Morissette, Peiyu Qin, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: In systems of strongly correlated electrons, the emergence of spontaneous symmetry breaking serves as a defining hallmark of the underlying many-body physics. Here, we report the discovery of an unprecedented emerging order in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene, defined by the intertwinement of rotational, time-reversal, and inversion symmetry breaking. The link between these broken symmetries is uncovered through angle-resolved transport measurements. The spontaneous breaking of rotational symmetry is identified by the Curie-Weiss behavior in the temperature-dependent onset of transport anisotropy. Most remarkably, the nematic transition, defined by the cusp of transport anisotropy, coincides with the emergence of the anomalous Hall effect in both the linear and nonlinear regimes. Our findings provide unambiguous experimental evidence of spontaneous condensation in momentum space, a phenomenon previously proposed to arise from a Coulomb-driven flocking effect. Together, these observations establish electronic anisotropy as a fundamental organizing principle in the landscape of intertwined electronic orders in strongly correlated two-dimensional systems.

Title: A model of full thermodynamic stabilization of nanocrystalline alloys
Authors: Omar Hussein, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: We propose a model of a polycrystalline alloy combining the Potts model for grain orientations with a lattice-gas model for solute thermodynamics and diffusion. The alloy evolution with this model is implemented by kinetic Monte Carlo simulations with nonlinear transition barriers between microstates. The model is applied to investigate the long-standing question of whether grain boundary (GB) segregation of an appropriate solute can drive the GB free energy to zero, creating a fully stabilized polycrystalline state with a finite grain size. The model reproduces stable polycrystalline states under certain conditions, provided the solute-solute interactions are repulsive. The material's structure minimizing the total free energy is not static. It exists in a state of dynamic equilibrium between the competing processes of grain growth and grain refinement. The alloy eliminates triple junctions by forming a set of smaller grains embedded into a larger matrix grain. It is predicted that, if a fully stabilized nanocrystalline state is realized experimentally, it will look very different from the conventional (unstable) nanocrystalline materials.

Title: Hybrid d/p-wave altermagnetism in Ca$_{3}$Ru$_{2}$O$_{7}$ and strain-controlled spin splitting
Authors: Andrea León, Carmine Autieri, Thomas Brumme, Jhon W. González
Abstract: The interplay of strong electronic correlations, sizable octahedral distortions, and pronounced spin--orbit coupling (SOC) makes perovskite oxides promising candidates for realizing altermagnetic phases. We study altermagnetic phases in Ca$_3$Ru$_2$O$_7$, a non-centrosymmetric layered perovskite whose ground state is a Kramers-degenerate antiferromagnet. We show that an alternative Néel-type spin arrangement hosts a P-2 $d$-wave altermagnetic state with orbital selectivity similar to Ca$_2$RuO$_4$. Including SOC generates a symmetry-allowed $p$-wave component and yields a hybrid $d$/$p$-wave altermagnetic order. We further demonstrate that biaxial strain tunes both magnetic stability and band splitting: compressive strain beyond 2\% favors the altermagnetic phase over the antiferromagnetic ground state, while tensile strain increases altermagnetic splittings by up to 9\%. To quantify these trends, we define an altermagnetic figure of merit and trace its strain dependence to changes in electronic localization and octahedral geometry in this polar metal.

Title: Striped Superconductor in Rhombohedral Hexalayer Graphene
Authors: Erin Morissette, Peiyu Qin, Hai-Tian Wu, Naiyuan J. Zhang, Ron Q. Nguyen, K. Watanabe, T. Taniguchi, J.I.A. Li
Abstract: The nature of a superconductor is fundamentally determined by the symmetries broken in its order parameter. Here, we report an exceptionally exotic superconducting phase in rhombohedral hexalayer graphene that simultaneously breaks rotational, translational, and time-reversal symmetries. We show that superconductivity emerges from a quarter-metallic state and is accompanied by the onset of stripe charge order. This unique intertwinement is revealed by angle-resolved transport measurements, which demonstrate dissipationless current confined to a single principal axis-forming one-dimensional-like superconducting channels -- while the orthogonal direction remains resistive down to the lowest temperatures. The formation of stripe order is marked by a first-order melting transition, evidenced by pronounced thermal hysteresis upon warming and cooling. In addition, magnetic-field-induced switching between superconducting states -- reminiscent of behavior previously observed in rhombohedral tetra- and pentalayer graphene -- signals time-reversal symmetry breaking. Collectively, these observations reveal a previously unrecognized quantum phase: a chiral superconductor embedded within a stripe-ordered anomalous Hall state.

Title: Evidence of Ultrashort Orbital Transport in Heavy Metals Revealed by Terahertz Emission Spectroscopy
Authors: Tongyang Guan, Jiahao Liu, Wentao Qin, Yongwei Cui, Shunjia Wang, Yizheng Wu, Zhensheng Tao
Abstract: The orbital angular momentum of electrons offers a promising, yet largely unexplored, degree of freedom for ultrafast, energy-efficient information processing. As the foundation of orbitronics, understanding how orbital currents propagate and convert into charge currents is essential - but remains elusive due to the challenge in disentangling orbital and spin dynamics in ultrathin films. Although orbital currents have been predicted to propagate over long distances in materials, recent theoretical studies argue that lattice symmetry may constrain their mean free paths (MFPs) to the scale of a single atomic layer. In this work, we provide the first direct experimental evidence for ultrashort orbital MFPs in heavy metals (HMs) - W, Ta, Pt - revealed by femtosecond terahertz emission spectroscopy. This is enabled by sub-nanometer-precision control of thin-film thickness using wedge-shaped HM|Ni heterostructures. By employing a multi-component terahertz-emission model, we quantitatively extract the orbital MFPs, consistently finding them shorter than their spin counterparts. Furthermore, control experiments rule out interfacial orbital-to-charge conversion as the dominant mechanism, confirming that the process is governed by the bulk inverse orbital Hall effect. Our findings resolve a central controversy in orbitronics and provide key insights into orbital transport and conversion mechanisms.

Title: Quasiparticle Interference of Spin-Triplet Superconductors: Application to UTe$_2$
Authors: Hans Christiansen, Brian M. Andersen, P. J. Hirschfeld, Andreas Kreisel
Abstract: Quasiparticle interference (QPI) obtained from scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is a powerful method to help extract the pairing symmetry of unconventional superconductors. We examine the general properties of QPI on surfaces of spin-triplet superconductors, where the properties of the $\vec d$-vector order parameter and topological surface bound states offer important differences from QPI on spin-singlet superconducting materials. We then apply the theory to a model specific to UTe$_2$, and compare the resulting QPI with recent STM measurements. We conclude that the two candidate Cooper pair instabilities $B_{2u}$ and $B_{3u}$ exhibit distinct features in the QPI intensity to discriminate these using the experimental data. Characteristic features of the emergent topological surface states protected by chiral symmetry in general, and by mirror symmetries in the case of UTe$_2$, provide further unique signatures to help pinpointing the pairing symmetry channel in this material.

Title: Line and Planar Defects with Zero Formation Free Energy: Applications of the Phase Rule toward Ripening-Immune Microstructures
Authors: Ju Li, Yuri Mishin
Abstract: Extended one- and two-dimensional defects in crystalline materials are usually metastable. The thermodynamic ground state of the material is presumed to be defect-free. Here, we investigate the conditions under which extended defects, such as grain boundaries, can exist in a multicomponent alloy when the latter reaches the thermodynamic ground state allowed by the Gibbs phase rule. We treat all extended defects as low-dimensional phases on the same footing as the conventional bulk phases. Thermodynamic analysis shows that, in the ground state, the formation free energies of all extended defects must be zero, and the system must follow a generalized phase rule. The latter predicts that only a finite number of symmetry-related defect types can coexist in the material in the ground state. Guided by the phase rule, we discuss finite-size polycrystalline and/or polyphase microstructures that are fully immune to coarsening and their possible transformations.

Title: Proximity-induced Rashba spin-orbit interaction in BaMnO$_\text{3}|$KTaO$_\text{3}$ heterostructure for antiferromagnetic spintronics
Authors: Vivek Kumar, Nirmal Ganguli
Abstract: Antiferromagnetic spintronics, a promising technology for ultra-fast electronic devices, faces several challenges, including the lack of materials simultaneously hosting robust antiferromagnetism and adequate Rashba-like interaction. We design a heterostructure of BaMnO$_3|$KTaO$_3$ with the idea of proximity-inducing strong Rashba spin-orbit interaction from KTaO$_3$ part to BaMnO$_3$ part, where the latter is already a robust antiferromagnet. Within our DFT calculations, the heterostructure reveals BaMnO$_3$ bands near the Fermi level with a significant magnetic moment per Mn atom and a decent ordering temperature. Further, the BaMnO$_3$ bands in the heterostructure exhibit linear Rashba interaction with a sizable Rashba coefficient, owing to its proximity to KTaO$_3$. Our work can motivate future research by demonstrating the road map to proximity-induced Rashba interaction for antiferromagnetic spintronics.

Title: Nonlinear projection for ballistic correlation functions: a formula in terms of minimal connected covers
Authors: Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: In many-body systems, the dynamics is governed, at large scales of space and time, by the hydrodynamic principle of projection onto the conserved densities admitted by the model. This is formalised as local relaxation of fluctuations in the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory, and is a nonlinear version of the Boltzmann-Gibbs principle. We use it to derive a projection formula, expressing $n$-point connected correlation functions (cumulants) of generic observables at different space-time points, in terms of those of conserved densities. This applies in every $d\geq 1$ spatial dimensions and under the ballistic scaling of space and time, both in and out of equilibrium. It generalises the well-known linear-response principle for 2-point functions. For higher-point functions, one needs to account for nonlinear fluctuations of conserved densities and, correspondingly, higher derivatives of local averages. Using Malyshev's formula for the cumulant expansion, and keeping the leading order, the result is a nonlinear projection, expressed as a sum of products of correlation functions of conserved densities with equilibrium multivariances as coefficients. The sum is combinatorially organised via certain covers of the set of space-time points, which we call minimal connected covers. We use this in order to get general, explicit formulas for two- and three-point functions in stationary states, expressed in terms of thermodynamic and Euler-scale data.

Title: Hydrodynamic noise in one dimension: projected Kubo formula and how it vanishes in integrable models
Authors: Benjamin Doyon
Abstract: Hydrodynamic noise is the Gaussian process that emerges at larges scales of space and time in many-body systems. It is justified by the central limit theorem, and represents degrees of freedom forgotten when projecting coarse-grained observables onto conserved quantities. It is the basis for fluctuating hydrodynamics, where it appears along with bare diffusion terms related to the noise covariance by the Einstein relation. In one spatial dimension, nonlinearities are relevant and may modify the corrections to ballistic behaviours by superdiffusive effects. But in systems where no shocks appear, such as linearly degenerate and integrable systems, the diffusive scaling of these corrections stays intact. Nevertheless, anomalies remain. We show that in such systems, the noise covariance is given by a modification of the Kubo formula, where effects of ballistic long-range correlations have been projected out, and that nonlinearities are tamed by a point-splitting regularisation. With these ingredients, we obtain a well-defined hydrodynamic fluctuation theory in the ballistic scaling of space-time, as a stochastic PDE. It describes the asymptotic expansion in the inverse variation scale of connected correlation functions, self-consistently organised via a cumulant expansion. The resulting anomalous hydrodynamic equation for average densities takes into account both long-range correlations and bare diffusion, generalising recent results. Despite these anomalies, two-point functions satisfy an ordinary diffusion equation, with diffusion matrix determined by the Kubo formula. In integrable systems, we show that hydrodynamic noise, hence bare diffusion, must vanish, as was conjectured recently, and argue that under an appropriate gauge of the currents, this is true at all orders. Thus the Ballistic Macroscopic Fluctuation Theory give the all-order hydrodynamic theory for integrable models.

Yousef, W. Zajkowska-Pietrzak, R. Sobierajski
Abstract: The ultrafast structural response of a thin iron film to sub-ps pulsed laser-induced heating has been investigated using time-resolved X-ray diffraction in the partial melting regime. A tetragonal distortion of the bcc-phase emerges at ~6 ps. Its formation is delayed relative to the initial heating (1-2 ps) and partial melting (2-5 ps) of the material, and controlled by the stress release in the quasi-instantaneously pressurized film. The distortion persists for at least 60 ps indicating the formation of a metastable bct phase between the equilibrium bcc and fcc phases.

Title: Equilibrium Propagation for Dissipative Dynamics
Authors: Marc Berneman, Daniel Hexner
Abstract: Computing gradients of a cost function is central to design-based optimization and machine learning algorithms. Equilibrium propagation provides an exact method to compute gradients in hardware by exploiting the inherent physical laws. The locality of these algorithms, in conjunction with local updates, enables mechanical and electronic systems that autonomously learn a function. We extend these methods to damped dynamical systems operating in the linear regime, such as mechanical structures obeying damped Newtonian dynamics and RLC circuits. By introducing an effective action whose extremum corresponds to the underlying dynamics, we derive local learning rules. This approach applies both to problems with periodic boundary conditions and to those with resting initial conditions. We demonstrate the viability of our method in mechanical and electronic systems and explore novel functionality such as classifying temporal sound signals. Our work opens the door to intelligent materials that process dynamical signals, enabling temporal computations, passive and active sensors, and materials that act as frequency-dependent filters.

Title: Decoherence of Majorana qubits by 1/f noise
Authors: Abhijeet Alase, Marcus C. Goffage, Maja C. Cassidy, Susan N. Coppersmith
Abstract: Qubits based on Majorana zero modes (MZMs) in superconductor-semiconductor nanowires have attracted intense interest as a platform for utility-scale quantum computing, due to their promise of intrinsically low error rates enabled by topological protection. These error rates are expected to be suppressed exponentially with increasing nanowire length or decreasing temperature. Here we identify a fundamental decoherence mechanism that challenges this expectation. The high-frequency components of 1/f charge noise, ubiquitous in semiconductor devices, can excite quasiparticles in the bulk of the topological superconductor, which travel to the ends of the nanowire to poison the MZMs. This mechanism leads to qubit errors that grow with the length of the nanowire. We calculate the excitation rates for clean nanowires and show that this noise imposes a strict limit on the coherence times of the qubits currently being developed, reducing them to less than one microsecond even under ideal conditions. These timescales are significantly shorter than those required for gate operations, posing a serious obstacle to the scalability of Majorana-based quantum computing.

Title: Multiscale Modeling of Vacancy-Cluster Interactions and Solute Clustering Kinetics in Multicomponent Alloys
Authors: Zhucong Xi, Louis G. Hector Jr., Amit Misra, Liang Qi
Abstract: Prediction of solute clustering kinetics in aged multicomponent alloys requires a quantitative understanding of complex vacancy-cluster interactions across multiple scales. Here, we develop an integrated computational framework combining on-lattice kinetic Monte Carlo (KMC) simulations, absorbing Markov chain models, and mesoscale cluster dynamics (CD) to investigate these interactions in Al-Mg-Zn alloys. The Markov chain model yields vacancy escape times from solute clusters and identifies a two-stage behavior of the vacancy-cluster binding energy. These binding energies are used to estimate residual vacancy concentrations in the Al matrix after quenching, which serve as critical inputs to CD simulations to predict long-term cluster evolution kinetics during natural aging. Our results quantitatively demonstrate the significant impact of quench rate on natural aging kinetics. Results provide insights to guide alloy chemistry, quench rates, and aging time at finite temperature to control the evolution of solute clusters and eventual precipitates in aged multicomponent alloys.

Title: Fermi Surface Reconstruction and Anisotropic Linear Magnetoresistance in the Charge Density Wave Topological Semimetal TaTe4
Authors: D. Silvera-Vega, J. Rojas-Castillo, E. Herrera-Vasco, E. Ramos-Rodríguez, A. F. Santander-Syro, J. A. Galvis, B. Uribe, R. González-Hernández, A. C. García-Castro, P. Giraldo-Gallo
Abstract: Understanding the interplay between topology and correlated electron states is central to the study of quantum materials. TaTe$_4$ is a quasi-one-dimensional charge density wave (CDW) compound predicted to host topological phases, which makes it a model platform to explore this interplay. Here, we combine high-field magnetotransport measurements with density functional theory calculations to provide a comprehensive mapping of the Fermi surface (FS) of TaTe$_4$ in its CDW phase. Using multiple current-field geometries, we resolve the four largest of six pockets of the FS predicted by theory and find no evidence of non-CDW bands, highlighting the full reconstruction of the FS in the bulk. We identify a previously unobserved quasi-cylindrical pocket and uncover a large size orbit consistent with magnetic breakdown between reconstructed FS sheets, from which we estimate a CDW gap of $\sim$0.29~eV. Moreover, we observe a robust linear magnetoresistance that persists across all field directions when current flows perpendicular to the 1D chains along which the CDW is formed, with a distinct high-field linear regime emerging when field is along the chains. These findings establish TaTe$_4$ as a prototypical material to study the coexistence of correlation-driven reconstruction and topological electronic states.

Title: Chaos in Nonequilibrium Two-Temperature $(T_x, T_y)$ Nosé-Hoover Cell Models
Authors: Hesam Arabzadeh, Carol Griswold Hoover, William Graham Hoover, Brad Lee Holian
Abstract: We revisit a two-temperature Nosé-Hoover wanderer particle embedded in a two-dimensional periodic 2x2 cell with four smooth repulsive corners at $(x,y) = (\pm 1, \pm 1)$ to explore chaos with anisotropic thermostatting. The model employs separate thermostats in the x and y directions, enabling controlled deviations from equilibrium. By integrating the full six-dimensional equations of motion and computing the complete Lyapunov spectrum, we confirm chaos and quantify phase-space contraction with high numerical precision. The total contraction rate, interpreted as entropy production, increases nonlinearly with the thermostat anisotropy, deviating from the quadratic dependence expected from linear-response theory, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2}$. We compare two fits for $\Lambda$ as a function of $\delta = 0.5 -T_y$: 1) a power law, $\Lambda\propto -\delta^{2.44}$, 2) a quadratic-plus-quartic expansion. While the former captures low-driving behavior slightly better, the latter more accurately describes the strongly driven regime and remains consistent with the equilibrium limit. An empirical linear relation between dissipation and phase-space dimensionality loss is also identified, $\Lambda\propto (D_{KY}-6) / 3$, where $D_{KY}$ is the approximate Kaplan-Yorke dimension. Our results demonstrate that nonlinear dissipation scaling emerges naturally even in minimal driven systems. Momentum statistics show significant non-Gaussian behavior under strong driving. Despite its dissipative nature, the model remains strictly time-reversible, offering a pedagogically rich example of microscopic reversibility coexisting with macroscopic entropy production.

Title: Chiral anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall effect in spin-orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals
Authors: Gautham Varma K, Mohd. Hashim Raza, Azaz Ahmad
Abstract: Recent studies have shown that chiral anomaly is not limited to Weyl semimetals (WSMs), but are also shown by a larger class of materials called spin orbit coupled noncentrosymmetric metals (SOC-NCMs),which has shed more insight into the origin of chiral anomaly as a Fermi surface property rather than a nodal property. In this study, we explore nonlinear transport responses in SOC-NCMswithin the framework of semiclassical dynamics, employing the Maxwell-Boltzmann transport theory augmented by charge conservation and momentum-dependent scattering processes. We take into account both non-magnetic and magnetic impurity scattering mechanisms. We demonstrate that the chiral-anomaly-induced nonlinear Hall (CNLH) response exhibits a characteristic quadratic dependence on the applied magnetic field and remains negative for both types of impurities. We find that magnetic scatterers leading to enhanced/suppressed interband scattering modifies the magnitude of the signal, but does not affect its qualitative behavior. In contrast, the presence of tilt in the band dispersion induces a pronounced anisotropic response, including a magnetic-field-direction dependent sign reversal that can be categorized into weak and strong regimes. Furthermore, the CNLH response shows substantial directional anisotropy governed by the relative orientation of the external magnetic field and the tilt vector. Our findings will be helpful in designing the experimental setup to get direction-dependent conductivity, which can be tuned externally with the help of magnetic impurity sites.

Title: Unconventional Altermagnetism in Quasicrystals: A Hyperspatial Projective Construction
Authors: Yiming Li, Mingxiang Pan, Jun Leng, Yuxiao Chen, Huaqing Huang
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a novel magnetic phase characterized by symmetry-protected, momentum-dependent spin splitting and collinear compensated magnetic moments, has thus far been explored primarily in periodic crystals. In this Letter, we extend the concept of altermagnetism to quasicrystals -- aperiodic systems with long-range order and noncrystallographic rotational symmetries. Using a hyperspatial projection framework, we construct decorated Ammann-Beenker and Penrose quasicrystalline lattices with inequivalent sublattices and investigate a Hubbard model with anisotropic hopping. We demonstrate that interaction-induced Néel order on such lattices gives rise to alternating spin-polarized spectral functions that reflect the underlying quasicrystalline symmetry, revealing the emergence of unconventional $g$-wave (octagonal) and $h$-wave (decagonal) altermagnetism. Our symmetry analysis and low-energy effective theory further reveal unconventional altermagnetic spin splitting, which is compatible with quasicrystalline rotational symmetry. Our work shows that quasicrystals provide a fertile ground for realizing unconventional altermagnetic phases beyond crystallographic constraints, offering a platform for novel magnetisms and transport phenomena unique to quasiperiodic systems.

Title: Quantum Skyrmion Qudit in a Triangular-lattice magnet
Authors: D. Maroulakos, A. Wal, A. Ugulava, O. Kharshiladze, L. Chotorlishvili
Abstract: Since the pioneering work Lohani et. al., Phys. Rev. X 9, 041063 (2019), it became clear that quantum skyrmions have highly unusual properties as compared to the classical skyrmions and, due to their quantumness, cannot be described by continuous magnetic textures akin to the classical skyrmions. Competing nearest-neighbor and next-nearest-neighbor ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic interactions in triangular spin-frustrated magnets lead to the formation of quantum skyrmion states. In frustrated magnets, skyrmions are characterized by the helical degree of freedom, which can store quantum information. In the limit of a weak electric field, the system can be described as a two-level system, i.e., a skyrmion qubit. Here, we propose a more general formulation of the problem and obtain general analytic solution of the model previously introduced in Psaroudaki et. al., Phys. Rev. Lett. 127, 067201 (2021). Our solution is valid not only for small barrier but for the arbitrary electric field. In the case of a significant barrier, we prove that the system's state is not a Skyrmion qubit as it was thought before, but a Skyrmion qudit. We constructed the density matrix of the Skyrmion qudit and studied its evolution in time. The obtained results suggest that the proposed model can be exploited further to meet the needs of quantum information theory and quantum skyrmionics. We showed that the $l_1$ norm of coherence of the skyrmion quantum qudit is a thousand times larger than the coherence of the skyrmion quantum qubit. The obtained result opens new perspectives for quantum skyrmion-based resource theory.

Title: A theory of strange metals
Authors: Simone Fratini
Abstract: I present a theory of transport and optical response in quantum materials that is based on the assumption that the motion of the charge carriers obeys the correspondence principle, in the sense that the quantum-mechanically averaged carrier diffusion in time is analogous to the classical case. In bad metals, where wave-like coherence is lost at each hop between neighboring atoms, this leads to strange $T$-linear resistivities with apparently Planckian scattering rates as well as both the stretched Drude and displaced Drude peaks that are commonly observed in optical absorption experiments. The present framework might also indicate a solution to the problem of universal dielectric relaxation in insulators.

Title: Simulations of dielectric permittivity of water by Machine Learned Potentials with long-range Coulombic interactions
Authors: Kehan Cai, Chunyi Zhang, Xifan Wu
Abstract: The dielectric permittivity of liquid water is a fundamental property that underlies its distinctive behaviors in numerious physical, biological, and chemical processes. Within a machine learning framework, we present a unified approach to compute the dielectric permittivity of water, systematically incorporating various electric boundary conditions. Our method employs a long-range-inclusive deep potential trained on data from hybrid density functional theory calculations. Dielectric response is evaluated using an auxiliary deep neural network that predicts the centers of maximally localized Wannier functions. We investigate three types of electric boundary conditions--metallic, insulating, and Kirkwood-Frohlich--to assess their influence on correlated dipole fluctuations and dielectric relaxation dynamics. In particular, we demonstrate a consistent methodology for computing the Kirkwood correlation factor, correlation length, and dielectric permittivity under each boundary condition, where long-range electrostatics play a critical role. This work establishes a robust and generalizable machine-learning framework for modeling the dielectric properties of polar liquids under diverse electrostatic environments.

Title: Quantum-impurity sensing of altermagnetic order
Authors: V.A.S.V. Bittencourt, Hossein Hosseinabadi, Jairo Sinova, Libor Šmejkal, Jamir Marino
Abstract: Quantum sensing with individual spin defects has emerged as a versatile platform to probe microscopic properties of condensed matter systems. Here we demonstrate that quantum relaxometry with nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond can reveal the anisotropic spin dynamics of altermagnetic insulators together with their characteristic spin polarised bands. We show that the distance and orientation dependent relaxation rate of a nearby quantum impurity encodes signatures of momentum space anisotropy in the spin diffusion response, a hallmark of altermagnetic order. This directional sensitivity is unprecedented in the landscape of quantum materials sensing, and it enables the distinction of altermagnets from conventional antiferromagnets via local, noninvasive measurements. Our results could spark new NV-sensing experiments on spin transport and symmetry breaking in altermagnets, and highlight the role of NV orientation to probe anisotropic phenomena in condensed matter systems.

Title: Double Helix of atomic displacements in Ferroelectric PbTiO$_3$
Authors: Yihao Hu, Shi Liu
Abstract: Recent theoretical work has predicted the existence of a "dipole spiral" structure in strained freestanding membranes, promising a route to giant electromechanical responses [\href{this https URL}{PRL \textbf{133}, 046802 (2024)}]. However, its microscopic nature, energetic landscape, and electronic properties remain largely unexplored from a first-principles perspective. Here, using density function theory on PbTiO$_3$ under biaxial tensile strain, we unveil a novel form of polar order: a chiral, non-collinear ferroelectric double helix. We find that the Pb- and Ti-cation sublattices form two distinct, intertwined helices, reminiscent of DNA. This intricate topology is stabilized by a collective helical twisting of the oxygen octahedral framework, which mediates an emergent electric Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya-like interaction. This unique structure, conceptualized as a "self-Moiré" crystal, manifests two coupled functionalities. First, it possesses a rotational pseudo-zero-energy mode that underpins a giant piezoelectric response ($e_{33}\approx$16 C/m$^2$). Second, the spiral's long-period potential fundamentally reconstructs the electronic band structure, leading to an emergent multi-valley electronic topology at the valence band edge. Our work establishes a powerful, purely physical route to designing complex chiral order and provides a unified platform where structural topology, giant electromechanical coupling, and multi-valley electronics are intrinsically linked.

Title: Magic Boundaries of 3D Color Codes
Authors: Zijian Song, Guanyu Zhu
Abstract: We investigate boundaries of 3D color codes and provide a systematic classification into 101 distinct boundary types, including two novel classes. The first class consists of 1 boundary and is generated by sweeping the codimension-1 (2D) $T$-domain wall across the system and attaching it to the $X$-boundary that condenses only magnetic fluxes. Since the $T$-domain wall cannot condense on the $X$-boundary, a new magic boundary is produced, where the boundary stabilizers contain $XS$-stabilizers going beyond the conventional Pauli stabilizer formalism, and hence contains 'magic'. Neither electric nor magnetic excitations can condense on such a magic boundary, and only the composite of the magnetic flux and codimension-2 (1D) $S$-domain wall can condense on it, which makes the magic boundary going beyond the classification of the Lagrangian subgroup. The second class consists of 70 boundaries and is generated by sweeping the $S$-domain wall across a codimension-1 submanifold and attaching it to the boundary. This generates a codimension-2 (1D) nested boundary at the intersection. We also connect these novel boundaries to their previously discovered counterpart in the $\mathbb{Z}_2^3$ gauge theory, equivalent to three copies of 3D toric codes, where the $S$ and $T$ domain walls correspond to gauged symmetry-protected topological (SPT) defects. New boundaries are produced whenever the corresponding symmetry of the SPT defect remains unbroken on the boundary. Applications of the magic boundaries include implementing fault-tolerant non-Clifford logical gates, e.g., in the context of fractal topological codes.

Title: Explicit decoders using fixed-point amplitude amplification based on QSVT
Authors: Takeru Utsumi, Yoshifumi Nakata
Abstract: Reliably transmitting quantum information via a noisy quantum channel is a central challenge in quantum information science. While constructing a decoder is crucial to this goal, little was known about quantum circuit implementations of decoders that reach high communication rates. In this paper, we provide two decoders with explicit quantum circuits capable of recovering quantum information when the decoupling condition is satisfied, i.e., when quantum information is in principle recoverable. These are applicable to both entanglement-assisted and non-assisted settings. By developing a technique that relies on a symmetric structure of the decoders, we show that they are applicable to any noise model. As a consequence, for any noisy channel, our decoders can be used to achieve a communication rate arbitrarily close to the quantum capacity by increasing the number of channel uses. To construct the decoders, we employ the fixed-point amplitude amplification (FPAA) based on the quantum singular value transformation (QSVT), extending a previous approach applicable only to erasure noise. Our constructions offer advantages in the computational cost, largely reducing the circuit complexity compared to previous explicit decoders. Through an investigation of the decoding problem, unique advantages of the QSVT-based FPAA are highlighted.

Title: Hydrodynamics without Boost-Invariance from Kinetic Theory: From Perfect Fluids to Active Flocks
Authors: Kevin T. Grosvenor, Niels A. Obers, Subodh P. Patil
Abstract: We derive the hydrodynamic equations of perfect fluids without boost invariance [1] from kinetic theory. Our approach is to follow the standard derivation of the Vlasov hierarchy based on an a-priori unknown collision functional satisfying certain axiomatic properties consistent with the absence of boost invariance. The kinetic theory treatment allows us to identify various transport coefficients in the hydrodynamic regime. We identify a drift term that effects a relaxation to an equilibrium where detailed balance with the environment with respect to momentum transfer is obtained. We then show how the derivative expansion of the hydrodynamics of flocks can be recovered from boost non-invariant kinetic theory and hydrodynamics. We identify how various coefficients of the former relate to a parameterization of the so-called equation of kinetic state that yields relations between different coefficients, arriving at a symmetry-based understanding as to why certain coefficients in hydrodynamic descriptions of active flocks are naturally of order one, and others, naturally small. When inter-particle forces are expressed in terms of a kinetic theory influence kernel, a coarse-graining scale and resulting derivative expansion emerge in the hydrodynamic limit, allowing us to derive diffusion terms as infrared-relevant operators distilling different parameterizations of microscopic interactions. We conclude by highlighting possible applications.

Title: Traction and Stress Control Formation and Motion of +1/2 Topological Defects in Epithelial Cell Monolayers
Authors: Pradip K. Bera, Molly McCord, Jun Zhang, Jacob Notbohm
Abstract: In confluent cell monolayers, patterns of cell forces and motion are systematically altered near topological defects in cell shape. In turn, defects have been proposed to alter cell density, extrusion, and invasion, but it remains unclear how the defects form and how they affect cell forces and motion. Here, we studied +1/2 defects, and, in contrast to prior studies, we observed the concurrent occurrence of both tail-to-head and head-to-tail defect motion in the same cell monolayer. We quantified the cell velocities, the tractions at the cell-substrate interface, and the stresses within the cell layer near +1/2 defects. Results revealed that both traction and stress are sources of activity and dissipation within the epithelial cell monolayer, with the direction of motion of +1/2 defects depending on whether energy is injected by stresses or tractions. Interestingly, patterns of motion, traction, stress, and energy injection near +1/2 defects existed before defect formation, suggesting that defects form as a result of spatially coordinated patterns in cell forces and motion. These findings introduce a new focus, on coordinated patterns of force and motion that lead to defect formation and motion.

Title: Viewing protected superconducting qubits through the lens of the cat qubit
Authors: Simon Lieu, Emma L. Rosenfeld, Kyungjoo Noh, Connor T. Hann
Abstract: We draw analogies between protected superconducting qubits and bosonic qubits by studying the fluxonium Hamiltonian in its Fock basis. The mean-field phase diagram of fluxonium (at the sweet spot) is identified, with a region in parameter space that is characterized by $\mathbb{Z}_2$-symmetry-broken ground states. In the heavy fluxonium limit, these ground states are well approximated by squeezed coherent states in a Fock basis (corresponding to persistent current states with definite flux but indefinite charge), and simple expressions are provided for them in terms of the circuit parameters. We study the noise bias in fluxonium via a universal Lindblad master equation and find that the bit-flip rate is exponentially small in $E_j/(k_B T)$, while the phase-flip rate does not get worse with this ratio. Analogous behavior is found in $\cos(2 \theta)$ qubits. We describe cat-qubit-inspired bias-preserving $X$ and $CX$ gates for fluxonium. We discuss first steps towards generating an Ising interaction between protected superconducting qubits on a two-dimensional lattice, with the aim of achieving a passive quantum memory by coupling a static Hamiltonian to a generic thermal bath.

Abstract: We consider the quantum-state-diffusion dynamics of the XXZ-staggered spin chain, also focusing on its noninteracting XX-staggered limit, and of the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model. We describe the process through quantum trajectories and evaluate the nonstabilizerness (also known as ``magic'') along the trajectories, quantified through the stabilizer Rényi entropy (SRE). In the absence of measurements, we find that the SYK model is the only one in which the time-averaged SRE saturates the random state bound and has a scaling with the system size that is well described by the theoretical prediction for quantum chaotic systems. In the presence of measurements, we numerically find that the steady-state SRE versus the coupling strength to the environment is well fitted by a generalized Lorentzian function. The scaling of the fitting parameters with the system size suggests that the steady-state} SRE linearly increases with the system size in all the considered cases, and displays no measurement-induced quantum transition, as confirmed by the curves of the steady-state SRE versus the system size.

Title: CAST: Cross Attention based multimodal fusion of Structure and Text for materials property prediction
Authors: Jaewan Lee, Changyoung Park, Hongjun Yang, Sungbin Lim, Woohyung Lim, Sehui Han
Abstract: Recent advancements in graph neural networks (GNNs) have significantly enhanced the prediction of material properties by modeling crystal structures as graphs. However, GNNs often struggle to capture global structural characteristics, such as crystal systems, limiting their predictive performance. To overcome this issue, we propose CAST, a cross-attention-based multimodal model that integrates graph representations with textual descriptions of materials, effectively preserving critical structural and compositional information. Unlike previous approaches, such as CrysMMNet and MultiMat, which rely on aggregated material-level embeddings, CAST leverages cross-attention mechanisms to combine fine-grained graph node-level and text token-level features. Additionally, we introduce a masked node prediction pretraining strategy that further enhances the alignment between node and text embeddings. Our experimental results demonstrate that CAST outperforms existing baseline models across four key material properties-formation energy, band gap, bulk modulus, and shear modulus-with average relative MAE improvements ranging from 10.2% to 35.7%. Analysis of attention maps confirms the importance of pretraining in effectively aligning multimodal representations. This study underscores the potential of multimodal learning frameworks for developing more accurate and globally informed predictive models in materials science.

Title: Entanglement and private information in many-body thermal states
Authors: Samuel J. Garratt, Max McGinley
Abstract: We use concepts from quantum cryptography to relate the entanglement in many-body mixed states to standard correlation functions. If a system can be used as a resource for distilling private keys -- random classical bits that are shared by spatially separated observers but hidden from an eavesdropper having access to the environment -- we can infer that the state of the system is entangled. For thermal states, we derive a simple relation between the information accessible to the eavesdropper and the linear response of the system. This relation allows us to determine which spatial correlations can be used to detect entanglement across wide varieties of physical systems, and provides a new experimental probe of entanglement. We also show that strong symmetries of a density matrix imply the existence of correlations that are always hidden from the environment. This result implies that, although grand canonical ensembles are separable above a finite temperature, canonical ensembles are generically entangled at all finite temperatures.

Title: Holographic central charge for sine dilaton gravity
Authors: Paramesh Mahapatra, Hemant Rathi, Dibakar Roychowdhury
Abstract: In this paper, we calculate the holographic central charge ($c_{sDG}$) associated with sine dilaton gravity (sDG) in the semiclassical limit. In the low energy limit, the sDG flows into the ordinary JT gravity which is a conjectured dual of ordinary Schwarzian quantum mechanics at strong coupling. We compute the associated central charge ($c_{JT}$), which reveals $c_{sDG}>c_{JT}$. We identify this as an artifact of the UV completion of JT gravity in terms of sine dilaton gravity.

Title: Global graph features unveiled by unsupervised geometric deep learning
Authors: Mirja Granfors, Jesús Pineda, Blanca Zufiria Gerbolés, Joana B. Pereira, Carlo Manzo, Giovanni Volpe
Abstract: Graphs provide a powerful framework for modeling complex systems, but their structural variability poses significant challenges for analysis and classification. To address these challenges, we introduce GAUDI (Graph Autoencoder Uncovering Descriptive Information), a novel unsupervised geometric deep learning framework designed to capture both local details and global structure. GAUDI employs an innovative hourglass architecture with hierarchical pooling and upsampling layers linked through skip connections, which preserve essential connectivity information throughout the encoding-decoding process. Even though identical or highly similar underlying parameters describing a system's state can lead to significant variability in graph realizations, GAUDI consistently maps them into nearby regions of a structured and continuous latent space, effectively disentangling invariant process-level features from stochastic noise. We demonstrate GAUDI's versatility across multiple applications, including small-world networks modeling, characterization of protein assemblies from super-resolution microscopy, analysis of collective motion in the Vicsek model, and identification of age-related changes in brain connectivity. Comparison with related approaches highlights GAUDI's superior performance in analyzing complex graphs, providing new insights into emergent phenomena across diverse scientific domains.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.

Authors: Zuhong Lin, Daoyuan Ren, Kai Ran, Jing Sun, Songlin Yu, Xuefeng Bai, Xiaotian Huang, Haiyang He, Pengxu Pan, Ying Fang, Zhanglin Li, Haipu Li, Jingjing Yao
Abstract: Accurately identifying the synthesis conditions of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is essential for guiding experimental design, yet remains challenging because relevant information in the literature is often scattered, inconsistent, and difficult to interpret. We present MOFh6, a large language model driven system that reads raw articles or crystal codes and converts them into standardized synthesis tables. It links related descriptions across paragraphs, unifies ligand abbreviations with full names, and outputs structured parameters ready for use. MOFh6 achieved 99% extraction accuracy, resolved 94.1% of abbreviation cases across five major publishers, and maintained a precision of 0.93 +/- 0.01. Processing a full text takes 9.6 s, locating synthesis descriptions 36 s, with 100 papers processed for USD 4.24. By replacing static database lookups with real-time extraction, MOFh6 reshapes MOF synthesis research, accelerating the conversion of literature knowledge into practical synthesis protocols and enabling scalable, data-driven materials discovery.
