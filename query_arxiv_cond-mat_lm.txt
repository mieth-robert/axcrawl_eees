Title: From molecular model to tensor model of nematic liquid crystals through entropy decomposition
Authors: Baoming Shi, Dawei Wu, Lei Zhang, Pingwen Zhang
Abstract: In the mathematical modeling of nematic liquid crystals, a practical and physically reliable $\mathbf{Q}$-tensor model can be derived from Onsager's molecular model with the Bingham closure. However, this procedure leads to a singular entropy term that implicitly depends on $\mathbf{Q}$, creating both computational and theoretical difficulties. In this paper, we characterize this entropy contribution by splitting it into a singular but explicit leading term and an implicit but regular correction term, the latter of which is proven to be sufficiently regular to be accurately approximated numerically, for example, by neural networks. This yields a computationally convenient free energy that can be used for the computation of nematic liquid crystals. Our numerical experiments demonstrate that the resulting free energy can capture the isotropic-nematic phase transition as well as the free-boundary droplet configurations.

Title: Apparatus to visualize flows in superfluid $^4$He below 1 K
Authors: I. Skachko, J. A. Hay, C. O. Goodwin, M. J. Doyle, W. Guo, P. M. Walmsley, A. I. Golov
Abstract: We describe a versatile apparatus for optical observations of experimental processes at temperatures down to 0.1 K. The cooling is achieved by a wet cryostat with a dilution refrigerator on a vibrationally-isolated platform, capable of continuous rotation at angular velocity of up to 3 rad/s. The illumination light beam from lasers on a non-rotating optical table at room temperature is introduced via an optical fiber. The images are transferred to the intensified camera at room temperature through a coherent bundle of $10^5$ optical fibers giving a spatial resolution of $\sim 30 \mu$m, depending on the magnification used. The adjustment of the position of the illumination light, as well as of the focusing of the camera on the object under investigation, can be controlled remotely with the help of piezoelectric positioners. The apparatus was used for visualization of particles dispersed in superfluid helium at temperatures down to 0.14 K. In one version of experiment, fluorescent light from clouds of excimer molecules He$_2^*$, generated in liquid helium by electron impact from electrons injected by sharp field-emission tips, was recorded and analyzed. In another, fluorescent particles of diameters between 1 $\mu$m and 6 $\mu$m were initially loaded onto the horizontal surface of a piezoelectric crystal of LiNbO$_3$ and then injected into liquid helium by short bursts of high-amplitude oscillations at the crystal's resonant frequency 1 MHz. The particle trajectories were filmed at a frame rate of up to 990 fps and analyzed.

Title: Non adiabatic dynamics of the ferroelectric soft mode
Authors: Gili Scharf, Lara Donval, Leah Ben Gur, Alon Ron
Abstract: Most microscopic descriptions of structural dynamics assume the Born-Oppenheimer separation, where electrons adjust adiabatically to ionic motion. When this separation breaks down, electronic and lattice degrees of freedom can evolve on different timescales, giving rise to new physical phenomena beyond the adiabatic limit. Here we use time-resolved, phase-sensitive second-harmonic generation and pump-probe reflectivity to reshape the ferroelectric free-energy landscape of SnTe while separately tracking polar order and coherent lattice motion. When photoexcitation transiently suppresses the double-well barrier, polarization dynamics become strongly nonlinear, while the coherent phonon dynamics remain harmonic. This decoupling cannot be described by a single adiabatic coordinate for the electronic polarization and ionic positions. We provide a unifying physical description for the non adiabatic dynamics of the ferroelectric mode and the mixed displacive/order-disorder nature of SnTe based on a separation of scales for the renormalization of the ferroelectric stiffness.

Title: Anisotropy reduction and tunability of hole-spin qubit g-factor in strained parabolic Ge/SiGe quantum wells
Authors: R. K. L. Colmenar, Arthur Lin, Omadillo Abdurazakov, Yun-Pil Shim, Garnett W. Bryant, Charles Tahan
Abstract: Hole-spin qubits in planar Ge/SiGe heterostructures have attracted significant attention in recent years owing to their favorable electrical characteristics and prolonged coherence times. However, the strong spin-orbit interaction also makes them susceptible to charge noise and inhomogeneous strain. This is further exacerbated by the highly anisotropic g-factor of the planar design. Although there are some known strategies to suppress charge noise, one approach is to engineer an isotropic g-factor. In this work we analyze how qubit confinement profile affects the g-factor of hole-spin qubits. We show that decreasing the characteristic in-plane qubit confinement length reduces the g-factor anisotropy. We perform analytical and numerical analysis to compare two types of quantum wells: square wells and parabolic wells. We show that square wells have limited tunability, while parabolic wells offer broader tunability, making them more promising for qubit engineering.

Title: Ab Initio Random Matrix Theory of Molecular Electronic Structure
Authors: Zhen Tao, Victor Galitski
Abstract: We use ab initio electronic-structure methods to investigate random-matrix theory (RMT) universality in molecular electronic structure. Using single-reference electronic structure methods, including Hartree-Fock, configuration-interaction singles (CIS), density functional theory, and linear-response time-dependent density-functional theory, we compute single-particle orbital energies and many-electron excitations of several representative molecules (benzene, alanine, 1-phenylethylamine, methyloxirane, and helicene chains). For generic low-symmetry geometries, the unfolded spectra of these ab initio Hamiltonians exhibit Wigner-Dyson level statistics of the Gaussian orthogonal ensemble (GOE). For extended helicene chains we explicitly restrict to bound valence excitations below the ionization threshold and still observe GOE statistics, indicating that the RMT universality is present for physical states of direct relevance to real molecules. We further explore the electric and magnetic field dependence of the molecular electronic spectra. The variance of electric polarizability (level curvature K) is predicted to be non-analytic in the magnetic field which serves as an infrared cutoff, <K^2> proportional to log(1/|B|). We observe a transition to the Gaussian unitary ensemble (GUE) by increasing the magnetic fields, although it occurs only at magnetic fields far beyond experimentally accessible scales. Our results indicate that random matrix universality provides a general framework for organizing ab initio predictions of interacting electron spectra in complex systems.

Title: Detecting Higher Berry Phase via Boundary Scattering
Authors: Chih-Yu Lo, Xueda Wen
Abstract: Higher Berry phase has recently been proposed to study the topology of the space of gapped many-body quantum systems. In this work, we develop a boundary-scattering approach to detect higher Berry phases in one-dimensional gapped free-fermion systems. By coupling a gapless lead to the gapped system, we demonstrate that the higher Berry invariant can be obtained by studying the higher winding number of the boundary reflection matrix. The resulting topological invariant is robust against perturbations such as disorder. Our approach establishes a connection between higher Berry invariants and transport properties, thereby providing a potentially experimentally accessible probe of parametrized topological phases.

Title: Automatic Identification of Compounds in Molecular Mixtures from Liquid-Phase Infrared Spectra
Authors: Yannah J.U. Melle, Thanh Nguyen, Jeffrey Lopez, Daniel Schwalbe-Koda
Abstract: Interpreting spectroscopy data is a critical bottleneck in automating chemical research and industrial characterization. Particularly within infrared (IR) spectroscopy, identifying compounds in complex, liquid-phase chemical mixtures largely relies on expert knowledge, as variable peak assignment, broadening, and shifts hinder data-driven methods. Here, we show that an algorithmic approach can identify components in both simulated and experimental mixture spectra with high accuracy despite nonlinearities in liquid-phase IR data. The method is comprehensively benchmarked with a dataset of over 44,000 simulated liquid-phase IR spectra for mixtures and achieves up to 90% accuracy in identifying molecular components across a dataset of binary and ternary liquid mixtures. Our strategy is robust to perturbation of spectra, and its accuracy is capped by near-identical liquid-phase IR spectra that limit the resolution of chemical identification, imposing theoretical limits on achieving perfect accuracy in structure identification. Finally, we apply the method to automatically interpret IR spectra in experimental settings, correctly identifying the components of nearly all samples within a blind study. This work provides tools and data to advance automated chemical laboratories through algorithmic interpretation of liquid-phase IR spectra of mixtures.

Title: Using near-flat-band electrons for read-out of molecular spin qubit entangled states
Authors: Christian Bunker, Silas Hoffman, Shuanglong Liu, Xiao-Guang Zhang, Hai-Ping Cheng
Abstract: While molecular spin qubits (MSQs) are a promising platform for quantum computing, read-out has been largely limited to electron paramagnetic resonance which is often slow and requires a global system drive. Moreover, because one prerequisite for the Elzerman and Pauli spin blockade readout mechanisms typical of semiconductor spin qubits is tunneling of electrons between sites, these read-out modalities are unavailable in MSQs. Here, we theoretically demonstrate electrical read-out of entangled MSQs via driven many-electron spin unpolarized currents. In particular, using a time-dependent density matrix renormalization group approach we simulate a maximally entangled MSQ pair between two electronic leads. Driving itinerant electrons between the two leads, we find that the conductance is greater when the MSQs are in the entangled singlet state as compared to the entangled triplet state. This contrast in conductance is enhanced when the electronic density of states at the Fermi energy is large and for narrow bandwidth. Our results are readily applicable to molecules supramolecularly functionalizing semiconductors with relatively flat bands such as single-wall carbon nanotubes under a magnetic field.

Title: Time-dependent Magnetic Fields and the Quantum Hall Effect
Authors: T.R. Govindarajan, V.P. Nair
Abstract: Ermakov has shown how the solution to the classical harmonic oscillator in one spatial dimension with general time-dependent frequency can be reduced to the time-independent case and an associated nonlinear ordinary differential equation, an analysis which has been applied to the Schrödinger equation as well. We extend this analysis to the Landau problem of a charged particle in a uniform magnetic field in two dimensions and construct the generalized Laughlin wave functions for the case when the magnetic field is time-dependent. We also work out the dynamics of density fluctuations (the Girvin, MacDonald, Platzman or GMP mode) and argue that it is possible to tune the frequency of the magnetic field to obtain a compressible droplet of fermions. We also analyze the dynamics of the edge modes of the droplet for the integer Hall effect.

Title: From Global Flocking to Local Clustering: Interplay between Velocity Alignment and Visual Perception of Active Particles
Authors: Mohit Gaur, Arnab Saha, Subhajit Paul
Abstract: Collective behavior in biological systems was first captured by the Vicsek model, in which particles align their velocities in the average direction of neighbors, leading to coherent motion and showing an order-disorder transition. However, in many complex environments, the interactions are non-reciprocal, lacking an action-reaction symmetry. Using framework of the Vicsek model, we implement non-reciprocity by restricting interactions to neighbors located inside a finite vision cone, for a particle by limiting its set of interacting neighbors which fall within a vision-cone, providing a minimal description for cognitive perception. Using detailed numerical simulations, we explore the clustering and flocking behavior due to competition between noise and limited visual perception in the presence of alignment interaction. For low noise, with reduction in the vision angle the system shows transition from a global coherent motion to locally ordered small-sized clusters. This behavior is confirmed through the steady-state distributions of velocity components and their fluctuation relative to the global mean. This is also characterized using a polar order-parameter and a two-point velocity correlation function. Interestingly, at small vision angles, particles exhibit strong short-range correlations within clusters even in the absence of any global coherence. Time-evolution of the related correlation functions illustrate the pathways towards the emergence of such structures. The time dependence of the average cluster size and the length-scale calculated from the two-point velocity correlation show scaling behavior and indicate that the emergence of density field clustering is a consequence of the velocity-field coherence. Any kind of ordering and clustering disappear in the limit of high noise and low vision-angle regime.

Title: Low-Noise Quantum Dots in Ultra-Shallow Ge/SiGe Heterostructures for Prototyping Hybrid Semiconducting-Superconducting Devices
Authors: M. Borovkov, Y. Schell, D. Sokolova, K. Roux, P. Falthansl-Scheinecker, G. Fabris, A. Bubis, D. Shah, J. Saez-Mollejo, R. Previdi, I. Taha, Azaz Genç, J. Arbiol, S. Calcaterra, A. D. C. Oliveira, D. Chrastina, G. Isella, G. Katsaros
Abstract: Planar germanium is currently the only semiconducting platform where high-coherence spin qubits and proximity-induced superconductivity have each been demonstrated. Recent research into spin qubits in Ge/SiGe heterostructures has focused on increasing the thickness of the SiGe capping layer, reporting improvements in the electrostatic noise levels. Meanwhile, heterostructures with thinner capping layers remain rather unexplored, despite the potential advantages for proximity-induced superconductivity. Here, we study a Ge/SiGe heterostructure with a thin SiGe cap $d \approx 4\ \mathrm{nm}$ and investigate its viability to host low-noise quantum dots. To keep the thermal budget compatible with superconducting layers, low-temperature oxide deposition processes were developed and implemented for the gate dielectrics. The charge-noise level of fabricated devices is estimated to be $1.8 \pm 1.0\ \mu\mathrm{eV}/\sqrt{\mathrm{Hz}}$, comparable to devices fabricated on shallow heterostructures $\left(d \sim 20\ \mathrm{nm}\right)$ with high-temperature deposited oxides. Low charge-noise levels, together with the straightforward integration of superconductors, make this heterostructure an attractive platform for prototyping hybrid semiconducting-superconducting devices.

Title: Granular aluminum induced superconductivity in germanium for hole spin-based hybrid devices
Authors: Giorgio Fabris, Paul Falthansl-Scheinecker, Devashish Shah, Daniel Michel Pino, Maksim Borovkov, Anton Bubis, Kevin Roux, Dina Sokolova, Alejandro Andres Juanes, Tommaso Costanzo, Inas Taha, Aziz Genç, Jordi Arbiol, Stefano Calcaterra, Afonso De Cerdeira Oliveira, Daniel Chrastina, Giovanni Isella, Ruben Seoane Souto, Maria Jose Calderon, Ramon Aguado, Jose Carlos Abadillo-Uriel, Georgios Katsaros
Abstract: In superconductor-semiconductor hybrid structures, superconductivity and spin polarization are competing effects because magnetic fields break Cooper pairs. They can be combined using thin films and in-plane magnetic fields, an approach that enabled the pursuit of Majorana zero modes, Kitaev chains, and Andreev spin qubits (ASQs), but remains challenging for materials with small in-plane g-factors. Here we show that granular aluminum (grAl), composed of nanometer-scale aluminum grains embedded in an amorphous oxide matrix, can overcome this limitation. By depositing grAl on Ge/SiGe heterostructures, we induce a hard superconducting gap with BCS peaks at 305 $\mu$eV and magnetic-field resilience for both the in-plane and out-of-plane directions, allowing Zeeman splitting of Yu-Shiba-Rusinov (YSR) states beyond 50 $\mu$eV (12 GHz). Leveraging this robustness, we reveal signatures of hole physics and demonstrate g-tensor tunability.

Title: Chapman-Enskog expansion for chirally colliding disks
Authors: Ruben Lier, Paweł Matus
Abstract: We study a two-dimensional fluid of hard disks undergoing chiral, energy- and momentum-conserving collisions. We show that despite the microscopic breaking of time-reversal symmetry, the H-theorem is obeyed, guaranteeing a relaxation towards equilibrium in the absence of external forces. In the dilute limit, a Chapman-Enskog expansion yields analytical expressions for the shear and odd viscosity and the thermal conductivity. Theoretical predictions are confirmed by nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations.

Title: Finite-temperature superfluid depletion of disordered Bose gases
Authors: Cord A. Müller
Abstract: At zero temperature, homogeneous interacting Bose-condensed fluids are entirely superfluid, with remarkable transport properties. A non-superfluid, normal component is induced by finite temperatures and spatial inhomogeneity, the combined effects of which are rather intriguing, and difficult to describe quantitatively. By inhomogeneous Bogoliubov theory, applicable to weakly interacting condensed Bose gases in static external potentials with arbitrary spatial correlations, we calculate the normal fluid density via the transverse current-current correlation. We obtain finite-temperature disorder corrections to the normal fraction known since Laudau's seminal two-fluid theory, using diagrammatic perturbation theory for systems of any dimensionality, with closed analytical expressions to leading, quadratic order in disorder strength.

Title: Phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states
Authors: Ryan O. Behunin, Taylor Ray, Dylan Chapman, Andrew J. Shepherd, Yizhi Luo, Peter T. Rakich
Abstract: Phonon modes within pristine crystalline resonators now routinely reach the quantum ground state. Such systems are attractive for quantum information science applications, as advanced fabrication and processing can enable relatively long quantum coherence times, and precision control can be realized through optical, electrical, or qubit coupling. In many state-of-the-art systems, the phonon lifetime is limited by disorder. In particular, native oxides or damaged `dead layers' at surfaces can host two-level tunneling states that lead to a particularly problematic form of dissipation that increases at lower temperatures. As mechanical losses are driven down in systems such as micro-fabricated bulk acoustic wave resonators, tunneling states are expected to emerge as the dominant mechanism for phonon decoherence. A quantitative description of these mesoscopic systems therefore requires a framework that captures interactions between a selected phonon mode and a large ensemble of TLS. Here, we derive a quantum master equation for this coupled system, permitting the phonon decoherence produced by two-level tunneling states to be calculated. As an example, we estimate the lifetime of a variety of quantum states within quartz micro-resonators hosting a thin surface layer of tunneling states. We find that the phonon coherence time is maximized at low temperatures, in spite of increased mechanical dissipation, and that phonon-TLS coupling can be reduced for modes with strain nodes at the surfaces.

Title: Yet another look at narrow escape through a tube
Authors: Victorya Richardson, Yick Hin Ling, Sean D Lawley
Abstract: The narrow escape problem concerns the time needed for a diffusing particle to exit a confining domain through a small hole in the boundary. While this problem is now well-understood, determining the escape time for a particle that must exit through a narrow tube has proven challenging. Indeed, relying on analogies with electrodynamics, parameter fits to simulations, and heuristics, a variety of conflicting estimates for this escape time have been offered over the last three decades, some of which are counterintuitive and arguably non-physical. In this paper, we combine matched asymptotic analysis and probabilistic methods to determine the exact asymptotics of the narrow escape time through a tube. We obtain a new escape time formula which reduces to the various prior estimates in certain special cases. If the diffusivity in the tube differs from the diffusivity in the rest of the domain, our results reveal the importance of the form of the multiplicative noise inherent to any diffusivity that varies in space. We discuss our results in the context of asymmetric cell division.

Title: Ambient-Pressure Organic Dirac Electron State in $α$-(BETS)$_2$AuCl$_2$
Authors: Takuya Kobayashi, Kazuyoshi Yoshimi, Aoto Nishimoto, Shinji Michimura, Hiromi Taniguchi
Abstract: We report an ambient-pressure Dirac electron (DE) state in a new organic conductor, $\alpha$-(BETS)$_2$AuCl$_2$ (BETS = bis(ethylenedithio)tetraselenafulvalene). This salt exhibits characteristic transport properties, including large positive in-plane and anomalous negative interlayer magnetoresistance. These signatures closely resemble the high-pressure DE states of $\alpha$-(ET)$_2$I$_3$ (ET = bis(ethylenedithio)tetrathiafulvalene). First-principles calculations including spin-orbit coupling identify the electronic state as a quasi-three-dimensional massive Dirac semimetal with residual Fermi pockets. This discovery provides a valuable platform for exploring bulk Dirac fermions without the complexity of high-pressure measurements.

Title: Electrostatic Gating of Ionic Conductance Through Heterogeneous van der Waals Nanopores
Authors: Aaron H. Barajas-Aguilar, Matthew Schiel, Ethan Cao, DaVante Cain, Margaret L. Berrens, Fikret Aydin, Tuan Anh Pham, Javier Sanchez-Yamagishi, Zuzanna S. Siwy
Abstract: Nanofluidic ionic transistors typically require gate voltages above 1 V and operate only at sub millimolar ionic strengths, limiting their biocompatible applications. We demonstrate ionic transistors consisting of single sub 10 nm nanopores drilled in van der Waals (vdW) heterostructures with internal gate electrodes made of few layer graphene. These devices deliver up to 10fold current modulation at gate voltages as low as 0.3 V in 10 mM KCl, and 2fold modulation at near physiological 100 mM KCl. Baseline conductance with no gate shows surface charge dominated transport below 100 mM KCl consistent with negatively charged hBN walls and 5 nm opening of the pores. The surface charge and the electrochemical asymmetry introduced by the three electrode configuration govern the device behavior: negative gate voltage (VG) enriches ionic concentrations and enhances current, whereas positive VG induces a local depletion zone that suppresses transport. The current modulation by VG is dependent on the polarity of the transmembrane potential and leads to ion current rectification. Molecular dynamics simulations of a nanopore in a hBN graphene hBN stack reveal confinement and surface charge dependent suppression of relative permittivity of interfacial water. Continuum modeling with radially varying interfacial water permittivity reproduces the asymmetric IV characteristics and explains how the embedded gate sculpts local potential and ion concentrations. By enabling sub 0.5 V control of ionic transport at up to 100 mM salt concentrations, these devices address a key barrier in nanofluidics and open the pathway to low power ionic circuits and biosensing.

Title: Rotational Phonons Drive Low-Energy Kinks in Cuprate Superconductors
Authors: Yanyong Wang, Manuel Engel, Christopher Lane, Henrique Miranda, Lin Hou, Bernardo Barbiellini, Adrienn Ruzsinszky, John P. Perdew, Robert S. Markiewicz, Arun Bansil, Jianwei Sun, Ruiqi Zhang
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) reveals ubiquitous quasiparticle ``kinks'' near $\sim$70 meV and $\sim$40 meV across cuprate superconductors, often accompanied by peak--dip--hump (PDH) structures. These features point to strong coupling between electrons and low-energy bosonic excitations, but the microscopic origin has remained elusive due to the limitations of conventional density-functional theory (DFT) and the high cost of beyond-DFT methods. Here, we systematically study the electron--phonon coupling (EPC) in hole-doped infinite-layer CaCuO$_2$ using the Strongly Constrained and Appropriately Normed (SCAN) density functional, explicitly including magnetic effects. We find a substantial EPC strength $\lambda$ of $\sim$0.5 in the magnetic phase, producing kinks and PDH structures in the 40-80~meV window in excellent agreement with experiments. The dominant contribution arises from rotational oxygen phonons, while breathing modes contribute little. Our results establish strong EPC in cuprates, highlight the key role of rotational phonons, and provide a framework for understanding spectral anomalies in cuprates and beyond.

Title: Designing heterostructures to control oxygen stoichiometry in helimagnetic perovskite strontium ferrite
Authors: Jennifer Fowlie, Bernat Mundet, Danilo Puggioni, Lopa Bhatt, Eric R. Hoglund, Woo Jin Kim, Jiarui Li, Sang Jun Lee, Wenchi Liu, Antoine Devincenti, James M. Rondinelli, David A. Muller, Harold Y. Hwang
Abstract: A large challenge in determining the physics of helimagnetic SrFeO3 is in stabilizing the stoichiometric chemical phase over long enough time scales to conduct extensive measurements. Degradation in SrFeO3 manifests mainly as a crossover from metallic to insulating behavior. Using a combination of electronic transport and density functional theory, we show that this degradation is dominated by oxygen loss, possibly on the order of one percent. We further demonstrate that high quality SrFeO3 thin films can be stabilized long-term by combining a nanoscale band insulator capping layer with an ex situ ozone anneal. We show that this produces a nearly-pristine cation sublattice and preserves metallicity for at least several weeks. These results establish a reliable pathway for producing chemically stable SrFeO3 thin films, enabling reproducible studies of its unusual helimagnetism.

Title: Measuring elastic properties of granular hydrogels: Effects of capillary interaction and ionic conditions
Authors: Jiayin Zhao, Haiyi Zhong, Yixiang Gan
Abstract: The elastic properties of granular hydrogels are commonly characterised under wet conditions, yet the influence of capillary interactions remains unclear. In practical applications, hydrogels operate in aqueous environments containing dissolved ionic species, where swelling and elastic behaviour depend sensitively on ionic conditions. In this study, an experimental setup is developed to measure elastic responses of granular hydrogels under wet conditions. This setup directly observes liquid bridges formation and its evolution during compression. Our results show that neglecting capillary contributions leads to a systematic underestimation of the Young's modulus of hydrogels. Such an underestimation due to the capillary interaction increases as the sample size or its intrinsic stiffness decreases. In addition to the swelling ratio, the tested samples were also prepared under controlled salinity levels. The experimentally observed dependence of stiffness on swelling and salinity conditions is well captured by a modified constitutive model. The development of this study offers a robust testing protocol for measuring elastic properties of hydrogels under various environmental conditions.

Title: Intrinsic Spin Filter Effect in a $d$-wave altermagnet KV$_2$Se$_2$O with Open Fermi Surface
Authors: Bin Liu, Pei-Hao Fu, Yu-Xuan Sun, Xiao-Lin Zhang, Si-Cong Zhu, Xiang-Long Yu, Hua Wu, Yuan-Zhi Shao
Abstract: Altermagnets offer a unique pathway to functional spintronics by combining vanishing magnetization with large spin splitting. Here, we demonstrate that the canonical d-wave altermagnet KV2Se2O can deliver giant tunneling magnetoresistance through orientation-dependent spin filtering. By analyzing the crystallographic spin segregation, we show that transport along specific crystallographic axes is nearly fully spin-polarized within the symmetry-protected ballistic channels. We implement this mechanism in a lattice-matched KV2Se2O/Bi2O2Se/KV2Se2O magnetic tunnel junction, which achieves a robust half-metallic transport regime. The symmetry-protected spectral gap in the parallel/anti-parallel configuration ensures a high tunneling magnetoresistance ratio, resulting in substantial tunneling magnetoresistance, robust thermally driven spin filtering, and spin Seebeck effect at room temperature. These findings provide a path of altermagnetic heterostructures as a high-performance platform for scalable, field-free, and thermally stable spin logic.

Title: Concerted Carrier-Barrier Dynamics in van der Waals Schottky Junctions Revealed by Time-Resolved Atomic Force Microscopy
Authors: Munenori Yokota, Hiroyuki Mogi, Yutaka Mera, Katsuya Iwaya, Taketoshi Minato, Shoji Yoshida, Osamu Takeuchi, Tatsuo Nakagawa, Hidemi Shigekawa
Abstract: Schottky junctions based on transition-metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) have emerged as key building blocks for next-generation optoelectronic devices that demand ultrafast response and high sensitivity. However, the ultrafast, nanoscale carrier dynamics at these interfaces, crucial for device performance, have remained experimentally elusive. Here, we introduce optical pump-probe time-resolved atomic force microscopy to directly visualize, in real space, the nanosecond-scale modulation of the Schottky barrier potential at a van der Waals junction formed by point contact between WSe2 and a PtIr tip. Complementary analyses using transient absorption spectroscopy and light-modulated current-voltage characteristics together with model simulations reveal that time-resolved currents originate from the concerted temporal evolution of photoexcited carriers and the subsequent barrier response, processes that also define the rate-limiting steps of the photocurrent. Our results uncover the essential interfacial dynamics that underpin TMDC-based photodetectors and photovoltaic elements, while establishing a new measurement paradigm that complements and extends existing spectroscopic techniques. This approach provides direct access to nonequilibrium processes hidden at nanoscale interfaces, offering a powerful route to rational design of high-performance optoelectronic devices.

Title: Unsupervised Discovery of Intermediate Phase Order in the Frustrated $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg Model via Prometheus Framework
Authors: Brandon Yee, Wilson Collins, Maximilian Rutkowski
Abstract: The spin-$1/2$ $J_1$-$J_2$ Heisenberg model on the square lattice exhibits a debated intermediate phase between Néel antiferromagnetic and stripe ordered regimes, with competing theories proposing plaquette valence bond, nematic, and quantum spin liquid ground states. We apply the Prometheus variational autoencoder framework -- previously validated on classical (2D, 3D Ising) and quantum (disordered transverse field Ising) phase transitions -- to systematically explore the $J_1$-$J_2$ phase diagram via unsupervised analysis of exact diagonalization ground states for a $4 \times 4$ lattice. Through dense parameter scans of $J_2/J_1 \in [0.3, 0.7]$ with step size 0.01 and comprehensive latent space analysis, we investigate the nature of the intermediate regime using unsupervised order parameter discovery and critical point detection via multiple independent methods. This work demonstrates the application of rigorously validated machine learning methods to open questions in frustrated quantum magnetism, where traditional order parameter identification is challenged by competing interactions and limited accessible system sizes.

Title: Oxygen permeability and stability in the entropy-stabilized Co-based Perovskite oxygen permeable membranes
Authors: Zaichen Xiang, Rui Chen, Shuangyue Wang, Jingjun Qin, Wanyi Zhang, Yucheng Li, Lingyong Zeng, Huixia Luo
Abstract: Oxygen transport membranes (OTMs), enabling catalytic reaction and gas separation, support crucial chemical engineering processes and decarbonization technologies, but their applications are hindered by limited oxygen permeation fluxes and inadequate long-term stability during operation. Here, a series of high-entropy perovskite OTMs based on La0.5Sr0.5CoO3 were designed and synthesized by the simple sol-gel method. The impact of varying doping ratios on the structure, surface morphology, oxygen permeability, and stability of these high-entropy OTMs was thoroughly examined. At 950 °C, the optimal composition, La0.25Sr0.25Gd0.2Nd0.2Pr0.1CoO3, achieved oxygen permeation fluxes of 1.62 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/He gradient and 1.46 mL min-1 cm-2 under air/CO2, respectively. Remarkably, all high-entropy OTMs demonstrated stable operation for over 100 h in a pure CO2 environment without a significant decline in performance. This finding paves a new way to enhance the structural and oxygen permeation stability of OTMs, and further promotes the application of OTMs in oxy-fuel combustion technologies aimed at improving CO2 capture and storage efficiency.

Title: Confinement-Induced Symmetry Breaking of Active Surfaces
Authors: Da Gao, Alexander Mietke, Rui Ma
Abstract: The actomyosin cortex, a thin layer of a cross-linked polymer network near the cell surface, generates active forces that are responsible for cell shape changes. Many developmental processes that involve such cell shape changes, most prominently embryonic cell division, are spatially confined by eggshells. To investigate the potential role of confinement in redirecting active stresses and enabling symmetry breaking phenomena during cell shape transformations, we study a hydrodynamic minimal model in which the cell cortex is represented as an active fluid surface that undergoes symmetric division in the absence of confinement. When enclosed by an ellipsoidal shell, a spontaneous symmetry-breaking transition emerges at a critical degree of confinement, where symmetrically dividing surfaces become unstable and polarized geometries appear. We show that this transition is controlled by the tightness of the confinement and analyze the solution space of stationary surfaces to identify the mechanisms underlying confinement-induced symmetry breaking.

Title: Robust Electrocaloric Performance Enabled by Highly-Polar Frustrated Nanodomains in NaNbO3-Based Ferrodistortive Relaxor
Authors: Feng Li, Changshun Dai, He Qi, Jiecheng Liu, Xiaoming Shi, Heng Zhou, Qiong Yang, Mingsheng Long, Lei Shan, Chunchang Wang, Jianli Wang, Zhenxiang Cheng
Abstract: Solid-state refrigeration technologies, represented by electrocaloric effect (ECE), are renowned for zero global-warming-potential and high cooling efficiency. Synergistically achieving high electrocaloric effect ({\Delta}T) and wide temperature span ({\Delta}Tspan) for EC materials takes a leapfrog toward practical cooling applications, typical for integrated circuits. Guided by phase-field simulation, Ba(Ti, Hf)O3 dubbed as a polar wrench, establishes polar frustration by setting up local stress field and manipulating octahedral oxygen tilt (OOT) in NaNbO3-based relaxor. The resultant P4bm framework entails short-range and highly-polar ferrodistortive nanodomains, i.e., the abundant highly-polar nanodomains facilitate to increase entropy change and robust OOT enables to impede thermal perturbations. Consequently, a large {\Delta}T of 0.85 K and 0.70 K with an ultrawide {\Delta}Tspan of 118 K and 130 K is obtained, contributing to an ultrahigh figure of merit of > 90 K2 in NaNbO3-Ba(Ti, Hf)O3, significantly outperforms its counterparts. The local structure responsible for robust EC performances are decrypted through 2D information from atomic-resolution scanning transmission electron microscope, 3D big-box model constructed from neutron total scattering and DFT calculations. These findings highlight that polar frustration strategy in ferrodistortive relaxor enables to pioneer emergent EC performances, and also unearth potential entropy-change-based ferroelectric and ferromagnetic materials beyond.

Title: Reasoning-Driven Design of Single Atom Catalysts via a Multi-Agent Large Language Model Framework
Authors: Dong Hyeon Mok, Seoin Back, Victor Fung, Guoxiang Hu
Abstract: Large language models (LLMs) are becoming increasingly applied beyond natural language processing, demonstrating strong capabilities in complex scientific tasks that traditionally require human expertise. This progress has extended into materials discovery, where LLMs introduce a new paradigm by leveraging reasoning and in-context learning, capabilities absent from conventional machine learning approaches. Here, we present a Multi-Agent-based Electrocatalyst Search Through Reasoning and Optimization (MAESTRO) framework in which multiple LLMs with specialized roles collaboratively discover high-performance single atom catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction. Within an autonomous design loop, agents iteratively reason, propose modifications, reflect on results and accumulate design history. Through in-context learning enabled by this iterative process, MAESTRO identified design principles not explicitly encoded in the LLMs' background knowledge and successfully discovered catalysts that break conventional scaling relations between reaction intermediates. These results highlight the potential of multi-agent LLM frameworks as a powerful strategy to generate chemical insight and discover promising catalysts.

Title: Integral formula for the propagator of the one-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Taiki Ishiyama, Kazuya Fujimoto, Tomohiro Sasamoto
Abstract: We present an exact integral formula for the multi-particle propagator of the one-dimensional Fermi--Hubbard model on an infinite lattice. The proof is based on the nested Bethe ansatz without relying on the string hypothesis. Our formula enables an explicit integral representation of the time evolution of arbitrary finite-particle wave functions and thereby provides a foundation for the exact analysis of nonequilibrium dynamics in the Hubbard model. It can further be applied to related open quantum models.

Title: Computational Frameworks for Patterned Two-Dimensional Magnetism
Authors: Soham Chandra, Soumyajit Sarkar
Abstract: Patterned two-dimensional (2D) magnetic nanostructures constitute geometry-engineered spin systems in which exchange, anisotropy, dipolar coupling, and finite-size effects operate on comparable energy scales. Spatial modulation of continuous magnetic films produces confinement-driven critical behavior, compensation phenomena, metastable switching pathways, and topologically non-trivial textures such as vortices and skyrmions. Computational modeling plays a central role in resolving this complexity, enabling quantitative construction of thermodynamic phase diagrams and analysis of geometry-dependent stability regimes. This review synthesizes theoretical and numerical frameworks for patterned 2D magnetism, including classical spin models, stochastic spin dynamics, rare-event methods, and multiscale parameterization informed by first-principles calculations. Representative systems-nanodot and antidot arrays, artificial spin-ice lattices, exchange-modulated heterostructures, and patterned van der Waals magnets- illustrate how geometry functions as an effective thermodynamic control parameter. Emerging directions in nonequilibrium modeling, multiphysics coupling, and scalable data-centric workflows are discussed in the context of predictive phase mapping. Patterned 2D magnetism thus exemplifies the convergence of geometry-controlled materials engineering and computational statistical physics, with phase stability and controlled spin textures at the core of next-generation spintronic architectures.

Title: Magnetic anisotropic pinning and symmetric breaking induced by interfacial coupling in topological-like ruthenate superlattices
Authors: Zhongyuan Jiang, Zhiwei Zhang, Kesen Zhao, Wenjie Meng, Yuanyuan Zhao, Yubin Hou, Zhangzhang Cui, Jian Zhang, Zheling Shan, Haoliang Huang, Qingyou Lu, Yalin Lu
Abstract: Interfacial engineering enables various emergent effects such as spin reorientations and transport anisotropy. Noncollinear spin textures are essential for realizing many emergent quantum transport phenomena. However, driving such spin structures requires precise control of the interfacial magnetic coupling in complex oxide heterostructures. Here, by utilizing competing exchange interactions at the interface between ferromagnetic metal SrRuO3 and ferromagnetic insulator LaCoO3, we discovered a noncollinear spin configuration in SrRuO3 sublayers. Magnetic stripes were induced by out-of-plane rather than in-plane magnetic fields, indicating strong anisotropy pinning in our superlattices. The observed magneto-transport anisotropy is well explained by our proposed spin configurations, accounting for contributions from both bulk and interface of the SrRuO3 layers. More interestingly, magnetic skymionic textures were absent even at high magnetic fields. The interfacial exchange interaction overwhelms the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI) that stabilizes skyrmions, featuring a higher exchange coupling energy than that for the topological spin textures. Our work highlights the potential of interfacial engineering in tuning the spintronic properties by designing proper interfacial interactions.

Title: Hall effect on nontrivial quadrupole order in quasi-kagome compound URhSn
Authors: Yusei Shimizu, Arvind Maurya, Yoshiya Homma, Motoi Kimata, Toni Helm, Ai Nakamura, Dexin Li, Atsushi Miyake, Dai Aoki
Abstract: This study focuses on the transport properties of the quasi-kagome compound URhSn, which exhibits successive phase transitions at TC =16 K (ferromagnetic phase) and TO =54 K (intermediate phase). A large anomalous Hall component is present along the easy-magnetization axis (H|| [0001]), and the Hall resistivity shows very complex temperature- and field-dependence, with a sign reversal at low temperatures. The Hall resistivity exhibits a nonlinear and unusual field-dependence. Interestingly, there exists an unusual Hall component that is not proportional to the magnetic susceptibility for H || [0001] in both the intermediate and ferromagnetic states. These results reveal unconventional transport properties of URhSn, providing important insights into nontrivial multipolar phases in 5f- electron systems.

Title: Thickness-Driven Control of Room Temperature Ferrimagnetic Skyrmions and their Topological Hall signature in GdFe Single Layers
Authors: Saroj Kumar Mishra, Y.K. Takahashi, C. Malavika, Karthik V. Raman, Jyoti Ranjan Mohanty
Abstract: Magnetic skyrmions are nanoscale, topologically protected spin textures with exceptional potential for high density data storage and energy efficient computing. Among various skyrmion hosting systems, rare earth transition metal ferrimagnets offer a promising platform due to their tunable magnetic properties and intrinsically low net magnetization. Despite this, the fundamental control of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single layer films remains unexplored. Here, we demonstrate a viable route for engineering room temperature skyrmions in GdFe single layers through precise control of film thickness (60 to 80 nm). Thickness variation enables the systematic tuning of key magnetic parameters, including perpendicular magnetic anisotropy and saturation magnetization, thereby allowing precise control over skyrmion size and density. Magnetic force microscopy (MFM) reveals a clear thickness dependent evolution of isolated skyrmion characteristics, where skyrmion size decreases while skyrmion density increases with increasing GdFe film thickness, in agreement with micromagnetic simulations. At the same time, magnetotransport measurements show a systematic enhancement in the topological Hall resistivity with thickness, further corroborating the increased skyrmion density observed in MFM. Scanning transmission electron microscopy reveals a compositional gradient across the film thickness, indicative of structural asymmetry and potential inversion symmetry breaking, contributing to the emergence of a bulk Dzyaloshinskii Moriya interaction. Notably, sub 60nm skyrmions with high areal density are stabilized at room temperature. This work provides a viable route to tailor the properties of ferrimagnetic skyrmions in single-layer GdFe films, paving the way for the development of high-density ferrimagnetic skyrmionic devices.

Title: A diffusion approximation for systems with frequent weak resetting
Authors: Tobias Galla
Abstract: We develop a diffusion approximation for systems subject to fast random resetting by small amplitudes. Equivalently, this describes systems with frequent but small catastrophes. We demonstrate the validity of the approximation by computing the stationary distribution and mean first-passage times of simple one-dimensional systems. The approximation captures dynamically induced correlations in multi-particle systems, and it can be used to generalise the conditionally independent and identically distributed structure recently found in systems with full resetting. Finally, we show that resetting can induce cycles and patterns, which can be characterised using the diffusion approximation.

Title: Skyrmion Phase and Non-Fermi Liquid Behavior in Nonsymmorphic Magnetic Weyl Semimetal
Authors: Xi Luo, Yue Yu
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between complex magnetic orders and topological electronic states in nonsymmorphic magnetic Weyl semimetals on the ReAlX family (Re is a rare earth element and X is Si or Ge). We construct a lattice model incorporating conduction Weyl fermions coupled to localized magnetic moments via Kondo interaction. By considering a multi-${\bf Q}$ cycloid magnetic configuration, which can evolve into a Skyrmion lattice under an in-plane Zeeman field, we analyze its profound impact on the band structure through magnetic Brillouin zone and band-folding. Using the Kubo formula, we calculate the conductivity tensor and examine the transport properties in the clean limit. Our results reveal that the Skyrmion lattice induces significant changes in electrical and Hall conductivities. Furthermore, the temperature-dependent resistivity deviates from the standard Fermi-liquid behavior ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^2$), showing a power-law scaling ($\rho_{xx}\sim T^\alpha$ with $\alpha$ between 3 and 5), indicative of non-Fermi liquid behavior. This work provides a theoretical framework connecting multi-${\bf Q}$ magnetic textures, Skyrmion physics, and anomalous transport in topological semimetals.

Title: Plausible universality of uniaxial order in self-assembly of cross junctions in space dimension $d \ge 3$
Authors: Kazuya Saito
Abstract: We consider the self-assembly of cross junctions in a general space dimension ($d$) as an extension of the problem studied in a previous paper for $d = 3$. This problem is equivalent to constructing a $d$-dimensional hypercubic jungle gym, at all junctions of which $2d$ rods with different colours meet. The analysis reveals a unique feature of the $d = 3$ case: the forced presence of at least one perfectly-ordered (singly coloured) direction (axis), in contrast to the possible absence of such a direction in $d \ge 4$. However, we will show that the uniaxial order is overwhelming not only in $d = 3$ but also for $d \ge 4$ in a sufficiently large system.

Title: Monitoring Gallium-Induced Damage in Aluminum Alloys Using Nonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy
Authors: Jan Kober, Radovan Zeman, Josef Krofta, Antonio S. Gliozzi, Marco Scalerandi
Abstract: Nonlinear Resonant Ultrasound Spectroscopy is a nonlinear ultrasonic technique which allows monitoring small variations in the microstructure of a medium and thus allows materials characterization and monitoring of damage evolution. Application of the technique to monitor Liquid Metal Embrittlement induced by gallium penetration in aluminum is presented here. To define indicators of material degradation, data treatment using the Singular Value Decomposition approach is introduced and discussed. Experimental results show that nonlinear properties are correlated with the state of the liquid metal in the solid matrix, allowing to identify different phases in the process of gallium diffusion along grain boundaries and within the bulk of individual grains. Furthermore, the evolution of gallium damage allows to study correlations between nonlinear, fast and slow dynamic properties.

Title: Combining matrix product states and mean-field theory to capture magnetic order in quasi-1D cuprates
Authors: Quentin Staelens, Daan Verraes, Daan Vrancken, Tom Braeckevelt, Jutho Haegeman, Veronique Van Speybroeck
Abstract: We study quasi-one-dimensional strongly correlated materials using a multi-step approach based on density functional theory, downfolding techniques, and tensor-network simulations. The downfolding procedure yields effective multiband Hubbard models that capture the competition between electron hopping and local Coulomb interactions relevant to the system's low-energy properties. The resulting multiband Hubbard models are solved using matrix product states. Applied to Sr$_2$CuO$_3$, SrBaCuO$_3$, and Ba$_2$CuO$_3$, this purely one-dimensional treatment yields no long-range magnetic order, in contrast to the magnetic ordering observed experimentally. To account for this behavior, we extend the multi-step approach by incorporating interchain couplings through a self-consistent mean-field scheme. This combined approach stabilizes finite staggered magnetizations, providing a consistent description of magnetic order in agreement with experiment. For Sr$_2$CuO$_{3.5}$ and SrCuO$_2$, we also tested an approach proposed for ladder materials, however, we find that these materials are not well suited for this approach due to the small magnitude of the intraladder hopping parameters.

Title: Self-avoiding tethered surfaces are always flat
Authors: A. D. Chen, M. C. Gandikota, M. J. Kim, A. Cacciuto
Abstract: The scaling behavior of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces has been debated for decades. Some theories predict that self-avoiding surfaces would crumple in the absence of bending rigidity, while most simulations suggested that they would remain flat. Recent simulations on ideal membranes with lattice perforations suggest that systematically removing surface area from a membrane may provide an alternative way to crumpling self-avoiding surfaces. We perform extensive numerical simulations of two models of fully flexible elastic tethered surfaces in which self-avoidance can be systematically and continuously tuned to the ideal limit. We show that in the thermodynamic limit, these surfaces remain flat with a size exponent $\nu=1$ for any finite degree of self-avoidance, with or without membrane perforations.

Title: Antiparallel spin polarizations as quadratic response in chiral systems
Authors: Akane Inda, Kohei Hattori, Hiroaki Kusunose, Satoru Hayami
Abstract: Chirality-dependent spin generation has attracted considerable attention in condensed matter physics. In this paper, we theoretically investigate antiparallel spin polarization as a chirality-dependent quadratic response, by using a finite chiral system composed of triangular prisms. Based on the nonlinear Kubo formalism and real-time simulations, we demonstrate that spatially inhomogeneous antiparallel spin polarizations are induced as a dissipative quadratic DC response to a homogeneous AC electric field. In particular, we elucidate role of microscopic parameters characterizing the handedness of chirality, and naive expectation of spin polarization as a consequence of spin accumulation of spin current.

Title: On the electrical double layer capacitance of the restricted primitive model: a link between the mesoscopic theory and the associative mean spherical approximation
Authors: O. Patsahan
Abstract: The results for the electrical double layer capacitance and the charge density of ``free ions'' obtained from the mesoscopic theory are compared with the corresponding results of the associative mean spherical approximation. While the first theory takes into account the fluctuations of the charge density, the second theory assumes that the free ions and ion pairs are in chemical equilibrium according to the mass action law. Our results demonstrate a fairly good agreement between the two theories at high densities and low temperatures.

Title: The Predictive Power of Chemical Bonding Analysis in Materials: a Perspective on Optoelectronic Properties
Authors: Gabriele Saleh, Liberato Manna
Abstract: Chemical bonding governs how atoms interact to form compounds, thereby determining their physicochemical properties. Despite being an elusive concept, chemical bonding has led to the development of models and tools to explain and predict the behavior of chemical species. This perspective addresses the adoption of chemical bonding analysis to the study of optoelectronic materials, emphasizing the im-portance of its predictive aspect. After reviewing the evolution of chemical bonding models from the first Lewis formulation to the present day, the perspective discusses material classes and chemical bonding phenomena most relevant for light harvesting and emission. We delve into metal halide perovskites and structurally related materials, given their central role in optoelectronic research. Various aspects of chemical bonding in these materials are surveyed, from the structure-property relationship to the rationalization of their electronic properties through molecular orbital diagrams. Two chemical bonding features are particularly important for optoelectronic materials: the ns2 lone pairs of the cations typically found in these materials (e.g. Pb, Sb, Bi) and the antibonding nature of valence and/or conduction bands. We discuss in depth the models to predict the implications of these two phenomena on optoelectronic properties. We also explore chalcohal-ides, a class of materials whose optoelectronic properties are recently emerging. From the chemical bonding perspective, these materials display intriguing phenomena due to the interplay of various types of chemical bonds. Finally, we discuss our vision on the role of chemical bonding analysis in the future of materials science, including synergies and antitheses with machine learning.

Title: Harnessing magnetic anisotropy for nonlinear magnetization precession and spin waves
Authors: P. I. Gerevenkov, L. A. Shelukhin, Ia. A. Filatov, P. A. Dvortsova, A. M. Kalashnikova
Abstract: The nonlinearity of magnetization precession and spin waves is a cornerstone of contemporary magnonics. We investigate nonlinear magnetization dynamics in a thin epitaxial iron film driven by femtosecond laser pulses in regimes of homogeneous precession and propagating magnetostatic spin wave packets. The magnetization precession anharmonicity, the generation of higher-order harmonics, and the dynamical rectification are experimentally demonstrated. The numerical solution of the non-linearized Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert equation reveals that these effects stem from the asymmetry in the energy potential. This asymmetry is readily achievable when an external magnetic field with a strength comparable to the magnetic anisotropy field is applied close to the hard axis. This work establishes a connection between the geometry of the energy profile and nonlinear responses, paving the way for designing magnonic devices with controlled harmonic generation and nonlinear spin wave interaction.

Title: Stochasticity of fatigue failure times in sheared glasses
Authors: Swarnendu Maity, Pushkar Khandare, Himangsu Bhaumik, Peter Sollich, Srikanth Sastry
Abstract: Fatigue failure occurs when a solid is subjected to repeated, cyclic loading. Glasses subjected to cyclic to shear deformation have recently been investigated using computer simulations and theoretical models, to characterize and rationalize the dependence of the number of cycles to failure, depending on the properties of the glasses, and the deformation amplitude. The average number of cycles to failure has been observed to diverge as the strain amplitude approaches the so-called fatigue limit from above. In this work, rather than the average times themselves, we investigate by computer simulations the distribution of fatigue failure times, in model glasses subjected to cyclic shear deformation and in an elasto-plastic model. In particular, we observe in atomistic simulations that the standard deviation of the logarithm of failure times are proportional to their mean values, with the proportionality constant decreasing as the system size increases, indicating a sharper distribution of failure times. Using a finite-element-based elasto-plastic model, we observe similar behavior and perform a system-size analysis showing that the ratio of the standard deviation to the mean tends toward zero in the thermodynamic limit. Such distributions, rather than arising solely from the distribution of disorder in the samples that have been subjected to cyclic deformation, appear to arise from the intrinsic stochasticity of the failure process, which we analyze through a stochastic damage accumulation model.

Title: ML-guided screening of chalcogenide perovskites as solar energy materials
Authors: Diego A. Garzón, Lauri Himanen, Luisa Andrade, Sascha Sadewasser, José A. Márquez
Abstract: Chalcogenide perovskites have emerged as promising absorber materials for next-generation photovoltaic devices, yet their experimental realization remains limited by competing phases, structural polymorphism, and synthetic challenges. Here, we present a fully data-driven and experimentally grounded screening and ranking framework to assess the stability and experimental feasibility of chalcogenide perovskites, integrating interpretable analytical descriptors, machine-learning models, and sustainability metrics. Using a curated experimental dataset of halide and chalcogenide compounds, we derive a new tolerance factor via the SISSO (sure independence screening and sparsifying operator) algorithm that more accurately distinguishes perovskite-forming compositions than established tolerance-factor-based screening criteria. This descriptor is combined with generative crystal structure prediction, composition-based bandgap estimation, and machine-learning-based feasibility assessment to systematically explore a wide chemical space of hypothetical chalcogenide perovskites. The resulting candidates are further evaluated using sustainability indicators, enabling multi-objective ranking tailored to both single-junction and tandem photovoltaic architectures. Beyond identifying several promising and previously unexplored chalcogenide perovskites, this work demonstrates a transferable screening strategy for chemically constrained materials spaces that balances optoelectronic performance, experimental viability, and long-term sustainability.

Title: Charge distribution across dislocation networks induced by a strained top layer in hexagonal boron nitride substrates
Authors: Isaac Soltero, James G. McHugh, Vladimir I. Fal'ko
Abstract: Hexagonal boron nitride (hBN) flakes are key building blocks for encapsulating two-dimensional (2D) materials, providing atomically flat surfaces and an excellent dielectric environment for high-mobility field-effect transistors and tunnelling devices. However, strain induced during mechanical exfoliation and assembly of van der Waals heterostructures may lead to plastic deformations of the hBN surface, injecting dislocation lines between the topmost layer and the underlying film. Since a monolayer of hBN is non-centrosymmetric and exhibits a piezoelectric response to deformation, individual dislocations and, in particular their networks, can generate electrostatic potential modulations in the encapsulated 2D material. Here, we examine scenarios in which the top hBN layer is uniaxially strained and/or twisted, and show how lattice reconstruction into dislocation networks leads to the formation of piezoelectric charge hotspots that effectively behave as charged defects.

Title: Interplay between Relativistic Spin-Momentum Locking and Breaking of Inversion Symmetry: conditions for p-wave magnetism
Authors: Amar Fakhredine, Giuseppe Cuono, Jan Skolimowski, Silvia Picozzi, Carmine Autieri
Abstract: We investigate the interplay between relativistic spin-momentum locking arising from altermagnetism and various forms of inversion symmetry breaking. Depending on the symmetry breaking, this can give rise to Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling (SOC), Weyl-type SOC, or the coexistence of two distinct spin-momentum lockings. We focus on the altermagnetic Ca2RuO4 as a testbed material. Our results reproduce the experimentally observed ground state, which is an A-centered magnetic order with the Neel vector along the b-axis, hosting spin cantings along the a- and c-axes but without weak ferromagnetism. Ca2RuO4 exhibits relativistic spin-momentum locking, with different even-parity wave orders for the three spin components. We interpret the experimental results on doped samples as evidence for a transition from a pure altermagnetic phase to a weak ferromagnetic phase. Under ferroelectric- and antiferroelectric-like distortions, there are no qualitative changes in the non-relativistic spin-momentum locking and in the weak ferromagnetism. However, we observe the rise of the Rashba or Weyl-type SOC. Using numerical and analytical models, we investigate which nodal planes persist when inversion symmetry is broken in the relativistic case. The spin-momentum locking of the other components adopt a p-wave character in the case of Rashba; in contrast, Weyl-type SOC disrupts all nodal planes, leaving only nodal lines. Finally, to simulate a stripe phase with structural distortions along the z-axis, we studied a modulated electric field inducing atomic displacements within one Ca2RuO4 layer. This produces a magnetic phase transition to an exotic altermagnetic state with two non-relativistic spin-momentum lockings hosting weak ferromagnetism. Our research presents a comprehensive analysis of various possible scenarios in altermagnets with breaking of inversion symmetries under relativistic effects

Title: Thermalization of neighboring nanomechanical resonators below 1 mK
Authors: Amir Youssefi, Mahdi Chegnizadeh, Francis Bettsworth, Richard Pedurand, Eddy Collin, Tobias J. Kippenberg, Andrew Fefferman
Abstract: The position noise spectra of six drums on a single chip were measured on a single cooldown below 1.3 kelvin. Cryostat temperatures as low as 0.7 mK were achieved. The temperature dependence of the resonance frequency and linewidth of the drum modes was analyzed in the framework of the tunneling two level system (TLS) model. Departures of the resonance frequency and the position noise power from the expected logarithmic and linear temperature dependences, respectively, were interpreted as indications of thermal decoupling from the cryostat. This previously unexplored measurement configuration revealed that similar neighboring drums on a single chip may be at different temperatures. At the lowest temperatures, some drums exhibited excess damping that decreased with temperature. The magnitude of the excess damping of the drums was correlated with the thermal coupling of their TLS to the cryostat. In the case of one drum, a temporary increase in its damping coincided with a decrease in its mode temperature. The thermalization of the TLS to the cold finger was independent of pump power, pulse tube state and temperature of the pre-cooling stages of the cryostat. These results reveal an interplay between TLS damping and thermalization of nanomechanics that motivates further theoretical work and may impact efforts to extend the coherence of mechanical resonators.

Title: Stress Relaxation in Monodisperse Entangled Polymer Melts: Correlation Between Viscoelastic Response and Single-Chain Relaxation via Molecular Dynamics Simulations
Authors: Alireza F. Behbahani
Abstract: We study stress relaxation in several types of entangled monodisperse linear polymer melts by comparing the shear stress relaxation modulus, $G(t)$, with the end-to-end vector autocorrelation function, $P(t)$. The study includes three Kremer-Grest bead-spring models with varying chain stiffness, as well as a chemistry-specific coarse-grained model of \emph{cis}-1,4-polybutadiene. For each model, multiple chain lengths were simulated, spanning a range of $N/N_e = 5$-$50$ entanglements per chain. We observe that in all cases the behavior of $G(t)$, beyond the short-time Rouse regime, is accurately described by $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}[P(t)]^2$, where the chain-length-independent prefactor $G^0_{\mathrm{N}}$ denotes the plateau modulus. This correlation is consistent with both double reptation and dynamic tube dilation models of polymer relaxation, although the two models are based on different physical pictures. The double reptation model represents the melt as a transient network in which stress relaxation is governed by the survival probability of pairwise entanglements. The dynamic tube dilation model, however, assumes that the tube of constraints surrounding a polymer chain progressively enlarges as relaxation proceeds. The relation $G(t) = G^0_\mathrm{N}[P(t)]^2$ can serve as a basis for determining the plateau modulus and the corresponding entanglement length. It also simplifies the modeling of $G(t)$, since an accurate analytical expression for $P(t)$ is sufficient to describe the long-time behavior of $G(t)$. We further compare the simulation data for $P(t)$ and $G(t)$ with theoretical predictions.

Title: Intrinsic (non)-Gilbert damping in magnetic insulators calculated from a minimal model and \textit{ab initio} spin Hamiltonians
Authors: Andrei Shumilin, Diego López-Alcalá, Nassima Benchtaber, Alberto M. Ruiz, José J. Baldoví
Abstract: We present an analytically solvable minimal model for the relaxation of low-frequency magnons in magnetic insulators arising from magnon-phonon and magnon-magnon interactions. The model establishes a direct connection between microscopic relaxation processes and Gilbert damping, and reveals how magnon decay evolves from bulk systems to the monolayer limit. We find that magnon-phonon coupling produces Gilbert damping of comparable magnitude in three- and two-dimensional magnets, with qualitative differences between flexural phonons in free-standing monolayers and three-dimensional phonons in substrate-supported layers. By contrast, non-Gilbert damping due to four-magnon scattering is strongly enhanced in two dimensions, where it becomes independent of spin-orbit coupling. To benchmark the model against real materials, we introduce a numerical approach for computing magnon damping from ab initio-derived spin Hamiltonians. We demonstrate that the central conclusions of the model remain valid for magnons in bulk YIG and in a monolayer of the van der Waals magnetic insulator CrSBr.

Abstract: We test the Transient Time Correlation Function (TTCF) method to compute nonequilibrium transport coefficients, highlighting its conceptual and practical difference from the standard time-average approach. While time averages extract transport properties from long stationary trajectories and discard transient dynamics, TTCF adopts the complementary strategy: it exploits the information contained in short-time transients following the onset of an external perturbation, while discarding the long-time evolution once stationarity is reached. We revisit the theoretical framework of TTCF and assess its numerical performance through representative case studies, the Lorentz gas and a many-body system, namely a chain of oscillators with anharmonic pinning potential. By direct comparison with time averages, we show that for the Lorentz gas TTCF yields consistent transport coefficients in both linear and nonlinear regimes at a reduced computational cost. Moreover, the TTCF displays superior precision in the linear-response regime, and remains reliable in non-ergodic situations, revealing the presence of regions of phase space corresponding to different behaviors, as well as the possibility of phase transitions. For the anharmonic chain, we show that TTCF is a scalable and efficient alternative for the numerical study of nonequilibrium transport.

Title: Geometric oscillations of local Hall and Nernst effects in ballistic graphene at weak magnetic fields
Authors: Z. Z. Alisultanov, A. V. Kavokin
Abstract: We predict a novel class of magnetotransport oscillations in ballistic graphene specific for a ring-shape geometry. Using the Büttiker-Landauer formalism, we analytically obtain the local Hall and Nernst coefficients in the weak-field ballistic regime. These coefficients exhibit pronounced oscillations as functions of both the magnetic field and the angular positions of the measurement probes. The oscillations originate from the discrete set of skipping orbits that geometrically connect the contacts, with resonances occurring when the angular separation between contacts times the radius of the disk equals an integer number of cyclotron diameters. Unlike conventional quantum oscillations in conductivity, this effect is robust at room temperature and can dominate local thermoelectric signals. This geometric control of ballistic flow provides a platform for studying electron hydrodynamics and engineering phase-coherent devices, with potential applications in sensitive terahertz detectors and thermal management systems.

Title: Tighter thermalization bounds for perturbed quantum many-body scars
Authors: Meng-Yun Mao, Zhixiang Sun, Wen-Long You
Abstract: Quantum many-body scars (QMBS) are exceptional eigenstates that defy thermalization, enabling long-lived coherent dynamics in strongly interacting systems. However, their stability under perturbations remains inadequately understood. In this work, we derive improved lower bounds on the thermalization time of QMBS under local perturbations with strength $\lambda$. Using both numerical simulations and analytical reasoning, we show that exact QMBS exhibit slow thermalization, with a timescale scaling as $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/d})$ owing to the stabilizing restricted spectrum-generating algebra (RSGA), which is a significant improvement over previous bounds (e.g., $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-1/(d+1)})$). Counterintuitively, approximate QMBS can thermalize even more slowly under generic perturbations, exhibiting $\tau \sim \mathcal{O}(\lambda^{-2})$ scaling due to second-order perturbative effects in the absence of such protective structure. These distinct thermalization behaviors clarify how exact and approximate scars maintain coherence. Our work advances previous findings by establishing a tighter bound on the thermalization time, clarifying when scarred dynamics remain long-lived under weak but generic perturbations.

Title: Quantum Resistance in Multilayer Graphene-BiFeO3 Memristor for Brain-Inspired Computing
Authors: Suman Roy, Priyanka Sahu, Subhabrata Das, Sameer Kumar Mallik, Susmita Jana, Alok Kumar, Himadri Nandan Mohanty, Kaushik Ghosh, B.R.K. Nanda, Satyaprakash Sahoo
Abstract: In the era of big data and the Internet of Things, quantum-level control of conductance states offers a promising route toward high-density data storage and brain-inspired neuromorphic computing. Although quantum conductance (QC) phenomena have been demonstrated in various metal oxide memristors, achieving reliable and precise control over quantized states remains in its infancy. Here, we demonstrate bidirectional quantum conductance states in multifunctional BiFeO3 (BFO) perovskite memristors integrated with multilayer-graphene contacts, enabling higher-order tunability and revealing the potential of perovskite-2D heterostructures for quantum-engineered memory and computing devices. XPS analysis provides detailed insights into oxygen vacancy dynamics in BFO, whereas first-principles density functional theory calculations clearly reveal a strong localized electric field at the graphene-BFO interface. Our devices exhibit current-controlled higher-order QC transitions facilitated by quantum point contact formation, giving rise to quantized conductance states during both SET and RESET processes. Time-lag correlation maps quantify the stochastic evolution of QC states under dynamic voltage-pulse tuning schemes. Notably, the quantized conductance states effectively emulate synaptic potentiation and depression, enabling precise weight modulation for high-accuracy image and digit recognition in convolutional neural networks. These findings establish perovskite-2D heterostructures as promising candidates for QC-driven resistive switching and demonstrate their potential for developing controllable quantum memristors.

Title: Intrinsic Instabilities and Mechanical Anisotropy in Halide Perovskite Monolayers
Authors: Gabriel X. Pereira, Lucas M. Farigliano, Roberto H. Miwa, Gustavo M. Dalpian
Abstract: Halide perovskites have been extensively studied owing to their excellent optoelectronic properties and their unique lattice characteristics, that are very soft and anharmonic. Recent studies indicate the importance of a deep understanding of their surfaces and, in the limit, the properties of low-dimensional structures based on these materials. To investigate the structural and electronic properties of halide perovskite monolayers (i.e., perovskenes), this work uses first-principles simulations. We have studied three different stoichiometries (ABX3, ABX4, and A2BX4) and structural phases for iodide, bromide, and chloride perovskite monolayers. Their thermodynamic behavior was evaluated through the construction of phase diagrams, highlighting the instability of the ABX4 stoichiometry, which was further supported by its mechanical instability. Structurally, the covalent characteristics of the Pb--X bond, in contrast to the Cs--X bonds, induce a strong anisotropy in the Young's modulus and Poisson's ratio along different crystallographic directions, and also account for the lower stiffness observed in the phases where the octahedra are not aligned. The electronic properties are somewhat similar to those of their 3D counterparts, but with a slightly larger band gap; in the monolayers, the band gap increases with halogen electronegativity (I, Br, Cl) and octahedral tilting. Moreover, the non-symmetric ABX3 stoichiometry exhibited a spin splitting due to the internal dipole moment in these layers. Overall, our work lays the groundwork for a deeper understanding of low-dimensional structures based on halide perovskites.

Title: Crystallography-driven molecularization of a two-dimensional spin-$3/2$ magnet
Authors: Hari Borutta, Tobias Müller, Ronny Thomale, Harald O. Jeschke, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Large-spin two-dimensional magnets are generally expected to develop conventional long-range order once the dominant exchange scale becomes appreciable. The layered spin-$3/2$ maple-leaf compound Na$_2$Mn$_3$O$_7$ defies this expectation: despite sizable antiferromagnetic interactions and no evident disorder, it exhibits no magnetic ordering and displays two well-separated thermodynamic crossover scales. We show that this behavior originates from a crystallography-driven molecularization of the magnetic degrees of freedom. The low-symmetry structure partitions the Mn sublattice into inequivalent exchange pathways, generating a pronounced hierarchy that nearly isolates antiferromagnetic hexagons. Magnetic correlations therefore develop in two stages: first within individual hexagons at a scale set by the dominant exchange, and only at much lower temperatures do frustrated inter-hexagon couplings attempt to establish coherence across the lattice. While isolated hexagons reproduce the two-step thermodynamic structure, the experimentally relevant temperature scales emerge only once the hexagons are embedded in the frustrated two-dimensional network. The resulting quantum ground state is magnetically disordered, characterized by strong intra-hexagon correlations and rapidly decaying inter-hexagon correlations. These results identify crystallographic inequivalence as a materials-level mechanism for stabilizing molecularized and quantum-disordered states even in large-spin two-dimensional magnets.

Title: Universal Transport Properties of Continuous quantum gases
Authors: Zi-yang Liu, Xiangguo Yin, Yunbo Zhang, Shizhong Zhang, Xi-Wen Guan
Abstract: The Drude weight characterizes ballistic transport in quantum many-body systems, yet a comprehensive understanding and exact analytical results for it remain elusive, especially in multi-component quantum gases. In this work, we leverage Generalized Hydrodynamics and the Thermodynamic Bethe Ansatz method to precisely compute the Drude weights of one-dimensional continuous integrable systems, such as the Lieb-Liniger model and the Bose-Fermi mixture model. We establish an exact, universal relationship between components of the Drude weight matrix and fundamental thermodynamic quantities (e.g., particle, enthalpy, and entropy densities) for the constituent particles with distinct statistics undergo dynamic coupling. For both models, we further derive analytical approximations of the Drude weight in distinct physical regimes and identify universal scaling laws for the Drude weight near quantum phase this http URL, to connect theory with experiment, we propose and simulate two feasible measurement protocols--a linear potential quench and a bipartitioning setup-verifying that they can reliably extract the Drude weights. Our results establish a direct link between macroscopic transport phenomena and microscopic quasiparticle structure, furnishing critical theoretical benchmarks for future ultracold atomic gas experiments.

Title: Band-Like Transport and Cation Off-Centring in Ag/Bi-Based Solar Absorbers

Weatherup, Simon J. Clarke, Seán R. Kavanagh, Robert L. Z. Hoye
Abstract: Ag(I)-Bi(III)-based semiconductors have gained substantial attention as nontoxic, stable alternatives to lead-halide perovskites for optoelectronics, but are widely limited by carrier localization, which severely restricts diffusion lengths. The most efficient Ag/Bi solar absorber is AgBiS2, but diffusion lengths in nanocrystal films are <50 nm. Carrier localization in this rock-salt (Fm-3m) system is believed to arise from cation disorder, and so we herein investigate the layered cation-ordered analogue. Through beyond-DFT simulations combined with neutron and X-ray powder diffraction, we reveal that off-centring of Ag+ and Bi3+ cations is energetically-favoured in this cation-ordered phase. Despite local distortions in the AgS6 and BiS6 octahedra, band-like transport takes place, which, surprisingly, also occurs in the cation-disordered rock-salt phase when these materials are made as bulk powders. The cubic-phase powders have the same degree of cation disorder as the nanocrystals that have carrier localization, which suggests that extrinsic factors play a determining role. We ascribe the intrinsic band-like transport of both phases of AgBiS2 to its close packing, ensuring high electronic dimensionality. These insights offer pathways for designing solar absorbers avoiding carrier localization limitations, and call for future efforts to enhance the efficiency of AgBiS2 photovoltaics to focus on large-grained thin films, or improved nanocrystal surface passivation.

Title: XY Model with Persistent Noise
Authors: Xia-qing Shi, Hugues Chaté, Benoît Mahault
Abstract: We consider a 2D XY model subjected to time-correlated noise, a model of direct relevance to active crystals, which were shown recently to be able to support very large deformations without melting in the presence of persistent fluctuations. We find that our persistent XY model can remain quasi-ordered in spite of correlations decaying much faster than allowed in equilibrium. We then investigate theoretically and numerically the order-disorder transition and conclude that it remains of the Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless type, but with scaling exponents that vary with the persistence time of the noise.

Title: Discovering new photovoltaics using optimal transport theory
Authors: Matthew A. H. Walker, Zibo Zhang, Junayd Ul Islam, Keith T. Butler
Abstract: Searching by chemical and structural analogy is one of the most commonly used and successful approaches to materials discovery. However, formulating this task for algorithmic implementation raises the question of how we define similar materials. Methods have been proposed for searching materials space using vectors based on chemical composition and functional fragments in the material. Descriptors for structural similarity have also been proposed. However, the question of how to incorporate and balance structural and compositional similarity measures in a single metric remains open. Here, we adapt methods developed for calculating distances between undirected graphs and apply them to crystalline materials similarity. The Fused Gromov-Wasserstein (FGW) metric uses optimal transport theory to map between two graphs considering a balance of the graph structure and the information present at the nodes of the graph (atoms in crystals). We apply the method to exploring new photovoltaic materials. We demonstrate that FGW is competitive with embeddings from an equivariant graph neural network, trained on $> 10^6$ materials, despite minimal training. We then apply FGW to a discovery campaign to identify materials from the Materials Project database that have not previously been explored as photovoltaics, but have similarities to known high-efficiency materials. After validating predictions with hybrid density functional theory, we identify seven previously unexplored high-efficiency photovoltaic absorber candidates, including Cs$_5$Sb$_8$, which is found to have a predicted SLME of $> 30\%$ and to be thermodynamically stable. The FGW approach demonstrates the power of strong inductive biases for developing metrics for materials exploration with minimal training data.

Title: Hydrodynamics of Dense Active Fluids: Turbulence-Like States and the Role of Advected Activity
Authors: Sandip Sahoo, Siddhartha Mukherjee, Samriddhi Sankar Ray
Abstract: Dense suspensions of self-propelled bacteria and related active fluids exhibit spontaneous flow generation, vortex formation, and spatiotemporally chaotic dynamics despite operating at vanishingly small Reynolds numbers. These phenomena, commonly referred to as active turbulence, display striking visual and statistical similarities to classical inertial turbulence while arising from fundamentally different nonequilibrium mechanisms. In this article, we present a combined review and theoretical study of hydrodynamic models for dense active fluids, with particular emphasis on bacterial suspensions described by the Toner--Tu--Swift--Hohenberg (TTSH) framework. We review key experimental and theoretical developments underlying the analogy between active and inertial turbulence, highlighting the emergence of multiple dynamical regimes and the conditions under which universal spectral and intermittent behavior arises in homogeneous systems. Moving beyond the conventional assumption of spatially uniform activity, we introduce a minimal model in which the activity field is heterogeneous and dynamically advected by the flow it generates. Thus treating activity as a spatiotemporally evolving field coupled to the TTSH dynamics, we investigate how advection and diffusion lead to sharp activity fronts, confinement of turbulent motion, and complex interfacial morphologies. Our numerical results demonstrate that spatial variations in activity can induce transient coexistence of distinct spectral regimes and that universality in active turbulence is inherently local and time-dependent in heterogeneous systems. These findings underscore the importance of treating activity as a dynamical field in its own right and provide a framework for studying active turbulence in more realistic, spatially structured biological and synthetic active matter systems.

Title: Micellar effects on Ostwald ripening in emulsions: Transition from cubic to quadratic particle size growth
Authors: Alexey Kabalnov
Abstract: Ostwald ripening in O/W emulsions in presence of solubilizing micelles is theoretically studied. At small average sizes, the kinetics is predicted to follow the classical Lifshits-Slezov-Wagner cubic law, with the rate proportional to the molecular solubility of the oil in water, as if no micelles were present. At larger particle sizes the kinetics transitions to the Wagner's quadratic law. The crossover point for the kinetics depends on the dynamics of the oil solubilizate-micelle exchange; it is set by the value of the oil atmosphere distribution parameter, kappa, which, somewhat like Debye length, is proportional to the square root of the micellar concentration. It should be noted that in the range when 1/kappa is close to the particle average radius, the ripening kinetics still nearly follows the cubic law, with only moderate deviations; in this case, the micellar effects are experimentally seen not as the deviations from the linearity, but as an apparent increase in the cubic rate. The increase is predicted to be larger in case of nonionic micelles of ethylene oxide type compared to ionic ones.

Title: Energy-resolved transport of ultracold atoms across the Anderson transition: theory and experiment
Authors: Jean-Philippe Banon, Sacha Barré, Ke Xie, Hoa Mai Quach, Xudong Yu, Yukun Guo, Myneni Niranjan, Alain Aspect, Vincent Josse, Nicolas Cherroret
Abstract: In a recent experiment [X. Yu et al., arXiv:2602.07654], energy-resolved measurements of an atomic matter wave spreading in a speckle potential enabled the direct observation of the three-dimensional Anderson transition. In this work, we present a quantitative theoretical description of the matter-wave dynamics based on a tailored implementation of the self-consistent theory of localization, which incorporates both the spectral and spatial properties of the state prepared in the disorder. We benchmark this theoretical approach against ab initio numerical simulations, and use it to analyze the atom density profiles observed experimentally in the localized, diffusive, and critical regimes. Particular emphasis is placed on the key role of the atomic energy distribution, especially on the distinct contributions of Bose-condensed and thermal atoms to interpret the experimental profiles. Our framework provides a versatile and efficient theoretical toolbox for quantitatively describing wave-packet dynamics in three-dimensional disordered quantum systems, which remain challenging for state-of-the-art large-scale numerical simulations.

Title: Effect of glass stability on the low frequency vibrations of vapor deposited glasses

Abstract: Ultra-stable glasses prepared from the physical vapor deposition of organic molecules present a very low density of two-level states, the kind of glass defects that determine their peculiar low temperature thermal properties. Numerical simulations suggest that quasi-localized harmonic vibrational modes emerge in the soft regions associated with two-level states. However, the connection between the low frequency vibrational modes and the local structural instabilities of glasses remains unexplained. Here we exploit a recently developed spectrograph for nuclear resonant analysis of inelastic X-ray scattering to probe the density of vibrational states of amorphous thin films of ultra-stable and conventional glasses down to an exceptionally low frequency of $\sim 70$ GHz. We show that the glass stability does not affect the harmonic vibrational modes at the lowest frequencies, despite a reduction of almost an order of magnitude in the density of two-level states. At the same time, the vibrational modes at higher frequencies, around the boson peak maximum, are extremely sensitive to the glass stability. Although we cannot exclude the possible existence of quasi-localized modes in glasses, we show that their presence is not strictly necessary to describe the measured density of low frequency vibrations. The experimental developments here presented pave the way to the solution to the long-standing debate on the low frequency vibrations in glasses.

Title: Tire tread block dynamics
Authors: N. Miyashita, B. N. J. Persson
Abstract: Temperature has a crucial influence on rubber friction and tire dynamics. The temperature field in a rubber tread block is the sum of the background temperature $T_0({\bf x},t)$, which varies slowly in time and space, and the flash temperature $\Delta T({\bf x},t)$, which in nonzero only close to the macroasperity contact regions, and which varies rapidly in time often on the millisecond time scale. Here we study the motion of a single tire tread block and how it is influenced by the flash temperature. We also present a theory and experimental results for the size of the macroasperity contact regions. In particular, we show that for a large enough nominal contact area, in most cases the diameter $D$ of the macroasperity contact regions are nearly independent of the elastic modulus and the nominal contact pressure.

Title: Mott Intermittency at the Metal-Insulator Boundary
Authors: Yuxin Wang, Vladimir Dobrosavljević, Jan Jaroszyński, Yohei Saito, Atsushi Kawamoto, Andrej Pustogow, Martin Dressel, Dragana Popović
Abstract: The resistivity maximum at a temperature $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$ is a recurring feature of bandwidth-tuned Mott systems, yet its meaning remains controversial: is it a coherence-incoherence crossover of an electronically homogeneous metal, or does it mark the onset of transport through a mixed landscape of metallic and insulating regions? Even more debated is whether a true phase-coexistence regime survives in the relevant parameter range, or whether apparent inhomogeneity is merely extrinsic. Here we address these questions by moving beyond temperature sweeps and probe charge transport in the time domain. Near $T=T_{\mathrm{max}}$, we find that the resistance of a model system, a quasi-two-dimensional Mott spin liquid material, exhibits clear random-telegraph switching between discrete levels over long timescales. The statistics of the switching - sharp two-level behavior with thermally activated dwell times - point to a mesoscopic "current-controlling" region that dynamically toggles between metallic and insulating states, intermittently opening and closing the dominant conduction channel. This characteristic fluctuating dynamics provides direct evidence for intrinsic metal-insulator coexistence and establishes $T\sim T_{\mathrm{max}}$ as the regime of Mott intermittency, where transport is governed by stochastic domain switching rather than quasiparticle decoherence.

Title: Lowering the temperature of two-dimensional fermionic tensor networks with cluster expansions
Authors: Sander De Meyer, Atsushi Ueda, Yuchi He, Nick Bultinck, Jutho Haegeman
Abstract: Representing the time-evolution operator as a tensor network constitutes a key ingredient in several algorithms for studying quantum lattice systems at finite temperature or in a non-equilibrium setting. For a Hamiltonian composed of strictly short-ranged interactions, the Suzuki-Trotter decomposition is the main technique for obtaining such a representation. In [B.~Vanhecke, L.~Vanderstraeten and F.~Verstraete, Physical Review A, L020402 (2021)], an alternative strategy, the cluster expansion, was introduced. This approach naturally preserves internal and lattice symmetries and can more easily be extended to higher-order representations or longer-ranged interactions. We extend the cluster expansion to two-dimensional fermionic systems, and employ it to construct projected entangled-pair operator (PEPO) approximations of Gibbs states. We also discuss and benchmark different truncation schemes for multiplying layers of PEPOs together. Applying the resulting framework to a two-dimensional spinless fermion model with attractive interactions, we resolve a clear phase boundary at finite temperature.

Title: Spatiotemporal Thermal Modulation and Patterning using a Programmable 1024 Element Microheater Array
Authors: Rahul Goyal, Jang-Hwan Han, Sadaf Pashapour, Peer Fischer
Abstract: Programmable microheater arrays are essential for a variety of applications including gas sensing, microfluidic lab on a chip devices, 3D printers, and biosensors that rely on DNA amplification. Increasing the density and number of heating elements directly correlates with the precision with which spatiotemporal heat profiles can be delivered. However, large arrays have thus far not been realized. One challenge is that as the number of elements in an array increases, the complexity of connecting them grows. Here, we show that row-column addressing provides a promising architecture for the efficient operation of a large micro-heater array. We introduce a programmable 32 x 32 microheater array consisting of individually addressable robust platinum (Pt)-based Joule heating elements- each smaller than 300 micrometer. We show that combining high-voltage multiplexed electronics and sequential addressing controlled by a high frequency clock, allows the independent operation of the 1024 microheater elements. We demonstrate the generation of heat images and the patterning of metallic structures formed from the liquid metal Gallium. Our work demonstrates new capabilities for on-chip thermal devices, and opens the possibility to realize novel heat-controlled microactuation systems.

Title: High-Pressure X-Ray Diffraction Study of Scheelite-type Perrhenates
Authors: Neha Bura, Pablo Botella, Catalin Popescu, Frederico Alabarse, Ganapathy Vaitheeswaran, Alfonso Munoz, Brendan J. Kennedy, Jose Luis Rodrigo Ramon, Josu Sanchez-Martin, Daniel Errandonea
Abstract: The effects of pressure on the crystal structure of scheelite-type perrhenates were studied using synchrotron powder X-ray diffraction and density-functional theory. At ambient conditions, the studied materials AgReO4, KReO4, and RbReO4, exhibit a tetragonal scheelite-type crystal structure described by space group I41/a. Under compression, a transition from scheelite-to-M${\prime}$-fergusonite (space group P21/c) was observed at 1.6 and 7.4 GPa for RbReO4 and KReO4, respectively. The transition involves a relative volume decrease. On the other hand, AgReO4 underwent a phase transition to the M-fergusonite structure (space group I2/a) at 13.6 GPa. In this case there is no appreciable volume discontinuity. The room-temperature pressure-volume equation of state for the three studied perrhenates was estimated using a second-order Birch-Murnaghan equation of state. The results for the low-pressure phase are confirmed by density-functional theory calculations. The analysis of the bulk modulus shows that the compressibility of the compounds decreases following the sequence RbReO4 > KReO4 > AgReO4, which is related to the compressibility of the RbO8, KO8, and AgO8 bidisphenoid units. Density-functional theory also offers valuable insights into the elastic constants. Despite giving a good description for the low-pressure phase in the three compounds, density-functional theory cannot catch the structural phase transition observed in experiments. Reasons for it are discussed in the manuscript.

Title: High-pressure single-crystal X-ray diffraction study of ErVO4
Authors: Josu Sanchez-Martin, Gaston Garbarino, Samuel Gallego-Parra, Alfonso Munoz, Sushree Sarita Sahoo, Kanchana Venkatakrishnan, Ganapathy Vaitheeswaran, Daniel Errandonea
Abstract: We present an investigation into the crystal structure of ErVO4 under variable pressure conditions. The high-pressure single crystal X-ray diffraction experiments performed employing helium as the pressure medium facilitated structure refinements up to 24.1(2) GPa. The transition from zircon to scheelite was observed at a pressure of 7.9(1) GPa. In contrast to previous reports, we did not detect any sign of phase coexistence. We also did not observe the second phase transitions previously predicted by density-functional theory to occur below 20 GPa. The determination of the pressure dependence of unit-cell parameters and volume yields precise values for linear compressibility of each axis and the pressure-volume equation of state for both the zircon and scheelite phases. Additional information on the mechanical properties of ErVO4, obtained from density-functional theory calculations, is also reported.

Title: Chiral Weyl-Kondo semimetals and hexagonal heavy fermion systems
Authors: Kuan-Sen Lin, Yuan Fang, Henrique Fabrelli, Runhan Li, Andrey Prokofiev, Fang Xie, Jennifer Cano, Maia G. Vergniory, Silke Paschen, Qimiao Si
Abstract: Strong correlation, in concert with symmetry and topology, engenders novel gapless phases of matter, though only a tip of the iceberg has been seen. An exemplary framework is provided by Weyl-Kondo semimetals, in which Weyl fermions develop through crystalline symmetry constraints on the emergent low-energy heavy-fermion excitations. This paradigm has opened up new opportunities to explore correlated topologies without a noninteracting counterpart, but fully realizing this potential requires a large base of candidate materials. Here we confront the challenge on both fronts by studying heavy fermion systems with hexagonal space groups. This family contains a large number of chiral nonsymmorphic crystal structures that promote Weyl degeneracies and, in addition, feature geometric frustration in the $f$-electron magnetism. Our calculations for the heavy fermion states identify Weyl-Kondo semimetals with chiral or achiral Weyl nodes in the respective structural classes. We also develop a new search strategy for the difficult case of strongly correlated materials, using a combination of materials database, symmetry classification and experiments, and propose as candidate topological heavy fermion systems the chiral CePt$_2$B and achiral Ce$_2$NiGe$_3$ and Ce$_6$Co$_{2-\delta}$Si$_3$. Our findings raise the prospect for strongly correlated metallic topology in the unusual setting of exotic quantum magnetism.

Title: Thermal activation drives a finite-size crossover from scale-free to runaway avalanches in amorphous solids
Authors: Gieberth Rodriguez-Lopez, Ezequiel E. Ferrero
Abstract: We investigate thermal avalanche dynamics in amorphous solids using elastoplastic models with local activation rules and no external driving. Dynamical heterogeneities, quantified through persistence measurements and the associated four-point susceptibility $\chi_4$, reveal the emergence of correlated spatiotemporal rearrangements as temperature is varied. As temperature increases, avalanche statistics evolve from scale-free behavior with exponential cutoffs to regimes dominated by system-spanning runaway events. We identify a system-size-dependent critical temperature $T_c(L)$ that separates intermittent avalanche dynamics from thermally assisted flow, where self-sustained avalanches transiently fluidize the system. We show that $T_c(L)$ decreases algebraically with increasing system size, suggesting that in the thermodynamic limit arbitrarily small but finite temperatures may destabilize the intermittent regime. The relation between avalanche size and duration resembles that in sheared systems, whereas the statistics of minimal distances to yielding reveal a temperature-driven reorganization of marginal stability absent in strictly driven overdamped dynamics. Our results demonstrate that thermal activation alone can generate a finite-size-controlled instability scale in disordered elastic media.

Wang
Abstract: The topological surface code is a leading candidate for harnessing long-range entanglement to protect logical quantum information against errors, and teleportation of logical states is desirable for robust quantum information processing. Nevertheless, scaling up the surface code in quantum teleportation poses a formidable challenge to experiment. Here on a superconducting quantum processor with 125 qubits, we demonstrate the robust teleportation of topological rotated surface code prepared by a linear-depth unitary circuit, with code distances up to 7. We obtain the teleportation phase diagram by tuning the local entangling gates uniformly across a finite threshold. Furthermore, we show that the entangling threshold can be boosted by coherent qubit rotations that inject magic resources beyond the Clifford regime, restoring the duality symmetry of the topological phase, which serves as a guiding principle to minimize the entanglement resource. Our results shed light on simulating and leveraging topological quantum matter on quantum devices, and pave the way to the ultimate goal of distributed fault tolerant quantum computation.

Title: Assessing quantum coherence in quantum annealers
Authors: Connor Aronoff, Travis Howard, David Nicholaeff, Alejandro Lopez-Bezanilla, Wade DeGottardi
Abstract: Demonstrating genuine many-body quantum coherence in large-scale quantum processors remains a central challenge for near-term quantum technologies. Recent experiments on D-Wave quantum annealers have investigated quenches of Ising chains and observed defect densities that show Kibble-Zurek scaling, consistent with coherent quantum dynamics. However, identical scaling can arise from classical or thermal processes. Here we propose the use of many-body coherent oscillations (MBCO) as a diagnostic for the identification of system-wide coherence in analog quantum simulators. Solving the time-dependent Schrodinger equation, we show that quenches of a staggered one-dimensional Ising chain across a quantum critical point produce oscillatory signatures in defect observables. We implement this model on the D-Wave Advantage quantum annealer. Using fast-anneal protocols, we find that, although defect densities follow Kibble-Zurek scaling, the expected oscillatory behavior is absent. We demonstrate that static disorder associated with individual qubits is not likely responsible for the absence of MBCO. Modest modifications to annealing schedules can dramatically enhance oscillation visibility. This work gives a general roadmap for the search for quantum coherence in noisy, large-scale quantum platforms.

Title: Efimov Effect in Ultracold Microwave-Shielded Polar Molecules
Authors: Shayamal Singh, Chris H. Greene
Abstract: A quantum-mechanical description is presented for the three-body physics of shielded dipolar molecules, including a prediction of observable Efimov physics. Despite the anisotropic and long-range nature of the interaction, shielding enables a regime in which universality emerges already at the two-body level and extends to the three-body sector, where Efimov physics emerges. On the negative side of the scattering-length resonance, computed trimer binding energies display the characteristic scaling expected for Efimov resonances. Finally, the sudden approximation can be used to create trimer bound states, starting from positive energy trap states as a way to create or detect these molecular trimers. Moreover, the three-body parameter expressed in dipolar units is found to be universal.

Title: Topological phase dynamics described by overtone-synthesized classical and quantum Adler equations
Authors: Hiroshi Yamaguchi, Motoki Asano
Abstract: The Adler equation is a well-known one-dimensional model describing phase locking and synchronization. Motivated by recent experiments using optomechanical oscillators, we extend the model to include overtone-synthesized sinusoidal coupling with adiabatic temporal modulation. This extension gives rise to unique topological features such as winding-number quantization, discontinuous phase-slip transitions, and hysteretic and non-reciprocal phase dynamics. We further extend the analysis to the quantum regime, where we find a counterintuitive result: the breakdown of winding-number quantization. This arises from the superposition of different winding-number states in a closed-space Thouless pump. Moreover, hysteretic dynamics, once eliminated in quantum adiabatic approximation, is recovered in non-adiabatic calculations, as the superposition of two Floquet states with different PT eigenvalues becomes the quantum counterpart of phase trajectory.

Title: Semi-classical limit of an attractive Fermi gas in one or two dimensions
Authors: Thomas Gamet (UMPA-ENSL)
Abstract: We study the ground-state of a Fermi gas with short range attrative interactions in one or two dimensions. N fermions are placed in a confining potential, and interact with each other through a negative potential, whose range is larger than the typical distance between particles. We show the convergence of the ground state energy of the Hamiltonian to a Thomas-Fermi energy in the large N limit. Furthermore, we prove convergence of the ground states, in the sense of their Husimi functions.

Title: Phase diagram of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu--Wilson model from the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group
Authors: Jian-Gang Kong, Shinichiro Akiyama, Tao Shi, Z. Y. Xie
Abstract: We investigate the phase structure of the single-flavor Gross--Neveu model with Wilson fermions using the Grassmann corner transfer matrix renormalization group (CTMRG). The path integral is formulated as a two-dimensional Grassmann tensor network and approximately contracted by the Grassmann CTMRG algorithm. We investigate the phase diagram by varying the fermion mass and the four-fermion coupling, using the pseudoscalar condensate as an order parameter for the $\mathbb{Z}_{2}$ parity symmetry breaking phase. The universality classes of the phase boundaries are identified through the central charge $c$ obtained via scaling analysis of the entanglement entropy. Furthermore, we extract the quantity related to the entanglement spectrum from the converged CTMRG environments, allowing us to distinguish the topological insulator phase and the trivial phase. The resulting phase structure suggests that the Aoki phase is separated from the other phases by critical lines characterized by $c=1/2$, while the critical lines with $c=1$ separate the topological insulating and trivial phases. Our numerical results also indicate that the Aoki phase does not persist in the strong-coupling regime for the single-flavor theory.

Title: Solderable Microcontroller-Integrated E-Textiles using UV-Tape-Assisted Laser Patterning Technique
Authors: Naoto Tomita, Suguru Sato, Toshihiro Takeshita, Aki Furusawa, Jarred Fastier-Wooller, Shun Muramatsu, Toshihiro Itoh, Michitaka Yamamoto
Abstract: In this study, we developed a UV-tape-assisted laser patterning (UT-Laser) technique that enables the simple transfer-based formation of wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m onto textile substrates. With the rapid advancement of wearable devices capable of acquiring various types of physiological and environmental information, research on electronic textiles (e-textiles)-in which electronic components are integrated into fabrics and clothing-has progressed considerably. However, integrating high-performance, rigid electronic components onto textiles remains challenging: the diameter of textile fibers limits the formation of fine wiring, making reliable mounting of such components difficult. To address these challenges, we devised the UT-Laser technique, in which thin foil or film materials are laser vector-cut on UV tape, and the adhesive strength is controlled through UV exposure. The unnecessary portions are selectively and collectively peeled away to form fine wiring, which is subsequently transferred onto the textile substrate. This approach enables facile fabrication of fine wiring with line widths below 200 $\mu$m on textiles. Furthermore, by forming fine wiring from a flexible copper clad laminate and transferring it onto heat-resistant glass cloth, electronic components can be soldered directly, allowing the fabrication of e-textile devices capable of withstanding more than 10,000 bending cycles. The prototype e-textile device fabricated using the proposed method integrates a microcontroller, USB connector, battery holder, flash memory, inertial measurement unit, and environmental sensors, and successfully acquires data related to stair climbing, respiration, and changes in body temperature during sleep.

Title: Room-temperature, continuous wave lasing in planar microcavities with quantum dots
Authors: Andrey Babichev, Mikhail Bobrov, Alexey Vasilev, Sergey Blokhin, Nikolay Maleev, Ivan Makhov, Natalia Kryzhanovskaya, Leonid Karachinsky, Innokenty Novikov, Anton Egorov
Abstract: High-quality planar cavities with low-absorption mirrors based on $Al_{0.2}Ga_{0.8}As/Al_{0.9}Ga_{0.1}As$ layers demonstrate continuous wave lasing at a wavelength of 957 nm. At 300 K, the threshold power density and quality-factor at threshold are (11.4$\pm$0.7) $kW/cm^2$ and (5070$\pm$160). Increasing the pumping level above two thresholds results in an enlargement in the quality-factor to at least 19000. Efficient lateral heat dissipation in the planar semiconductor microcavity is confirmed by a low mode-energy shift, which is 660 $\mu$eV at two lasing thresholds.

Title: On some mathematical problems for open quantum systems with varying particle number
Authors: Benedikt M. Reible, Luigi Delle Site
Abstract: We derive the effective Hamiltonian $H - \mu N$ for open quantum systems with varying particle number from first principles within the framework of non-relativistic quantum statistical mechanics. We prove that under physically motivated assumptions regarding the size of the system and the range of the interaction, this form of the Hamiltonian is unique up to a constant. Our argument relies firstly on establishing a rigorous version of the surface-to-volume ratio approximation, which is routinely used in an empirical form in statistical mechanics, and secondly on showing that the Hilbert space for systems with varying particle number must be isomorphic to Fock space. Together, these findings provide a rigorous mathematical justification for the standard grand canonical formalism employed in statistical physics.

Title: Quantum Error Mitigation Simulates General Non-Hermitian Dynamics
Authors: Hiroki Kuji, Suguru Endo, Tetsuro Nikuni, Ryusuke Hamazaki, Yuichiro Matsuzaki
Abstract: While non-Hermitian Hamiltonians enable exotic dynamical phenomena, implementing their nonunitary time evolution on near-term quantum devices remains challenging. We propose a hardware-friendly protocol that simulates non-Hermitian dynamics without continuous monitoring. Gorini-Kossakowski-Sudarshan-Lindblad (GKSL) evolution via classical Gaussian white-noise averaging and to subsequently cancel the quantum-jump contribution at the level of the measured observable using stochastic quantum error mitigation (QEM). The scheme requires no ancillas or controlled time-evolution, while the mitigation layer uses only single-qubit operations. We validate the method through numerical simulations of a model with asymmetric hopping, interaction, and disorder. Our work provides a programmable and ancilla-free framework investigating exotic dynamics that are not completely-positive and trace-preserving using QEM.

Title: Universal Persistent Brownian Motions in Confluent Tissues
Authors: Alessandro Rizzi, Sangwoo Kim
Abstract: Biological tissues are active materials whose non-equilibrium dynamics emerge from distinct cellular force-generating mechanisms. Using a two-dimensional active foam model, we compare the effects of traction forces and junctional tension fluctuations on confluent tissue dynamics. While these two modes of activity produce qualitatively different cell shapes, rearrangement statistics, and spatiotemporal correlations in fluid states, we find that the long-time cellular motion universally converges to persistent Brownian dynamics. This universal feature contrasts with the non-universal correlations between cell geometry, rearrangement rate, and fluidity, which depend sensitively on the underlying modes of active force. Our results demonstrate that persistent Brownian motion provides a minimal framework for describing tissue dynamics, while distinct active forces leave identifiable structural and dynamical signatures, thereby enabling inference of the dominant active force in fluid state tissues.

Title: Quantum criticality in open quantum systems from the purification perspective
Authors: Yuchen Guo, Shuo Yang
Abstract: Open quantum systems host mixed-state phases that go beyond the symmetry-protected topological and spontaneous symmetry-breaking paradigms established for closed, pure-state systems. Developing a unified and physically transparent classification of such phases remains a central challenge. In this work, we introduce a purification-based framework that systematically characterizes all mixed-state phases in one-dimensional systems with $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau}$ symmetry. By introducing an ancillary $\kappa$ chain and employing decorated domain-wall constructions, we derive eight purified fixed-point Hamiltonians labeled by topological indices $(\mu_{\sigma\tau},\mu_{\tau\kappa},\mu_{\kappa\sigma}) \in \{\pm1\}^3$. Tracing out the ancilla recovers the full structure of mixed-state phases, including symmetric, strong-to-weak spontaneous symmetry breaking, average symmetry-protected topological phases, and their nontrivial combinations. Interpolations between the eight fixed points naturally define a three-dimensional phase diagram with a cube geometry. The edges correspond to elementary transitions associated with single topological indices, while the faces host intermediate phases arising from competing domain-wall decorations. Along the edges, we identify a class of critical behavior that connects distinct strong-to-weak symmetry-breaking patterns associated with distinct strong subgroups, highlighting a mechanism unique to mixed-state settings. Large-scale tensor-network simulations reveal a rich phase structure, including pyramid-shaped symmetry-breaking regions and a fully symmetry-broken phase at the cube center. Overall, our purification approach provides a geometrically transparent and physically complete classification of mixed-state phases, unified with a single $\mathbb{Z}_2^{\sigma} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\tau} \times \mathbb{Z}_2^{\kappa}$ model.

Title: Nonequilibrium steady states in driven holographic Weyl semi-metals
Authors: Matteo Baggioli, Sebastian Grieninger, James Stokes
Abstract: Three-dimensional Weyl materials provide a controlled setting for exploring Floquet dynamics in open quantum systems, including nonequilibrium steady states (NESS). Motivated by the desire for a strongly-coupled description, we employ holography to analyze the formation and stability of a NESS in a Weyl semi-metal induced by an external circularly polarized electric field. A time-periodic steady-state solution is constructed and its stability is determined from the spectrum of out-of-equilibrium quasinormal modes (Floquet exponents). A stable region in the drive parameter space is identified; beyond a critical curve, the Floquet exponents enter the upper half of the complex plane, leading to a superharmonic response. At sufficiently strong driving, chaotic time evolution emerges in the fully nonlinear initial-boundary value problem. The anomaly-induced response of the NESS to an external magnetic field is also computed, and the resulting behavior is related to the previously proposed chiral pumping effect.

Title: MBD-ML: Many-body dispersion from machine learning for molecules and materials
Authors: Evgeny Moerman, Adil Kabylda, Almaz Khabibrakhmanov, Alexandre Tkatchenko
Abstract: Van der Waals (vdW) interactions are essential for describing molecules and materials, from drug design and catalysis to battery applications. These omnipresent interactions must also be accurately included in machine-learned force fields. The many-body dispersion (MBD) method stands out as one of the most accurate and transferable approaches to capture vdW interactions, requiring only atomic $C_6$ coefficients and polarizabilities as input. We present MBD-ML, a pretrained message passing neural network that predicts these atomic properties directly from atomic structures. Through seamless integration with libMBD, our method enables the immediate calculation of MBD-inclusive total energies, forces, and stress tensors. By eliminating the need for intermediate electronic structure calculations, MBD-ML offers a practical and streamlined tool that simplifies the incorporation of state-of-the-art vdW interactions into any electronic structure code, as well as empirical and machine-learned force fields.

Title: Purcell-enhanced Bright and Dark Exciton Emission from Perovskite Quantum Dots in Micro-ring Resonators
Authors: Lanyin Luo, Mohit Khurana, Ian M. Murray, Sina Baghbani Kordmahale, Akanksha Pandey, Xiaohan Liu, Alexei V. Sokolov, Dong Hee Son
Abstract: Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) integrated with waveguide-coupled dielectric resonators are promising building blocks for compact on-chip light sources. However, deterministic placement of QDs with strong mode overlap at the desired location remains a challenge. Here, we demonstrate a simple and scalable strategy for integrating colloidal QDs with a waveguide-coupled Si3N4 micro-ring resonator platform and for controlling the radiative dynamics of both bright and dark excitons via Purcell enhancement. We use strongly quantum-confined CsPbBr3 QDs, which exhibit bright-exciton emission at room-temperature, while emission at cryogenic temperatures originates from both bright and dark excitons. The CsPbBr3 QDs are selectively retained on the Si3N4 micro-ring cavities through a spin-coating/rinsing process, enabling efficient overlap with whispering-gallery modes and routing of the emission through integrated waveguides. We confirm accelerated decay of emission from both bright and dark excitons for CsPbBr3 QDs coupled to the micro-ring cavities. These results demonstrate an effective route to integrate colloidal QDs with Si3N4 micro-ring cavities and to leverage cavity-enhanced emission in scalable integrated photonic devices.

Title: Phase-Dependent Excitonic Light Harvesting and Photovoltaic Limits in Monolayer Y2TeO2 MOenes
Authors: Bill D. A. Huacarpuma, Jose A. dos S. Laranjeira, Nicolas F. Martins, Julio R. Sambrano, Kleuton A. L. Lima, Santosh K. Tiwari, Alexandre C. Dias, Luiz A. Ribeiro Jr
Abstract: We investigate phase-dependent electronic and excitonic phenomena in monolayer Y2TeO2 MOenes in the 1T and 2H polymorphs using first-principles theory and an effective many-body framework. Phonon spectra and elastic stability criteria establish both phases as dynamically and mechanically stable. Quasiparticle band structures reveal direct gaps in the near-infrared to visible range, with gap values increasing systematically from semilocal to hybrid exchange treatments. Optical spectra computed using a tight-binding Bethe-Salpeter approach demonstrate pronounced excitonic resonances arising from reduced dimensionality and weak dielectric screening. The exciton binding energies reach 152 meV in the 1T phase and 126 meV in the 2H phase, reflecting enhanced quantum confinement in the structurally denser phase. Our results identify Y2TeO2monolayers as a rare class of stable, direct-gap MOenes with strong excitonic effects, providing a platform for exploring many-body physics in low-dimensional oxychalcogenide systems especially for photovoltaic applications.

Rodrigues, Rodrigo Benevides, Marco Liffredo, Jyotish Patidar, Oleksandr Pshyk, Matteo Fadel, Luis Guillermo Villanueva, Sebastian Siol, Gerhard Kirchmair, Yiwen Chu
Abstract: Circuit quantum acoustodynamics (cQAD) devices have a wide range of applications in quantum science, all of which depend crucially on the quantum coherence of the mechanical subsystem. In this context, high-overtone bulk acoustic-wave resonators (HBARs) are particularly promising, since they have shown very high quality factors with negligible dephasing. However, the introduction of piezoelectric films, which are necessary for coupling to a superconducting circuit, can lead to additional loss channels, such as surface scattering and two-level systems (TLS). Here, we study the acoustic dissipation of HBAR resonators in cQAD systems and find that the defect density of the piezoelectric material and its interface with the bulk are limiting factors for the coherence. We measure acoustic modes with phonon lifetimes up to 400 $\mu$s and lifetime-limited coherence times approaching one millisecond in the quantum regime. When coupled to a superconducting qubit, this leads to a hybrid system with a large quantum coherence cooperativity of $C_{T_2}=1.1\times10^5$. These results represent a new milestone for the performance of cQAD devices and offer concrete paths forward for further improvements.

Title: Quantum jumps in open cavity optomechanics and Liouvillian versus Hamiltonian exceptional points
Authors: Aritra Ghosh, M. Bhattacharya
Abstract: Exceptional points, where two or more eigenstates of a non-Hermitian system coalesce, are now of interest across many fields of physics, from the perspective of open-system dynamics, sensing, nonreciprocal transport, and topological phase transitions. In this work, we investigate exceptional points in cavity optomechanics, a platform of interest to diverse communities working on gravitational-wave detection, macroscopic quantum mechanics, quantum transduction, etc. Specifically, we clarify the role of quantum jumps in making a clear distinction between Liouvillian and Hamiltonian exceptional points in optomechanical systems. While the Liouvillian exceptional point arises from the unconditional Lindblad dynamics and is independent of the phonon-bath temperature, the Hamiltonian exceptional point emerges from the conditional no-jump evolution and acquires a thermal shift due to an enhanced conditional damping. Employing the thermofield formalism, we derive a unified spectral framework that interpolates between these regimes via an analytical hybrid-Liouvillian description. Remarkably, in the weak-quantum-jump regime, the exceptional point is perturbed only at the second order, highlighting the robustness of the Hamiltonian exceptional point under small hybrid perturbations. Our work reveals a continuous family of hybrid exceptional points, clarifies the operational and physical differences between the conditional and unconditional dissipative dynamics in optomechanical systems, and provides a probe for thermal baths.

Title: Entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics
Authors: Satori Tsuzuki
Abstract: This article presents an entropy stability analysis of smoothed dissipative particle dynamics (SDPD) to review the validity of particle discretization of entropy equations. First, we consider the simplest SDPD system: a simulation of incompressible flows using an explicit time integration scheme, assuming a quasi-static scenario with constant volume, constant number of particles, and infinitesimal time shift. Next, we derive a form of entropy from the discretized entropy equation of SDPD by integrating it with respect to time. We then examine the properties of a two-particle system for a constant temperature gradient. Interestingly, our theoretical analysis suggests that there exist eight different types of entropy stability conditions, which depend on the types of kernel functions. It is found that the Lucy kernel, poly6 kernel, and spiky kernel produce the same types of entropy stability conditions, whereas the spline kernel produces different types of entropy stability conditions. Our results contribute to a deeper understanding of particle discretization.

Title: Exciton enhanced nonlinear optical responses in monolayer h-BN and MoS2: Insight from first-principles exciton-state coupling formalism and calculations
Authors: Jiawei Ruan, Y.-H. Chan, Steven G. Louie
Abstract: Excitons are vital in the photophysics of materials, especially in low-dimensional systems. The conceptual and quantitative understanding of excitonic effects in nonlinear optical (NLO) processes is more challenging compared to linear ones. Here, we present an ab initio approach to second-order NLO responses, incorporating excitonic effects, that employs an exciton-state coupling formalism and allows a detailed analysis of the role of individual excitonic states. Taking monolayer h-BN and MoS2 as two prototype 2D materials, we calculate their second harmonic generation (SHG) susceptibility and shift current conductivity tensor. We find strong excitonic enhancement requires that the resonant excitons are not only optically bright themselves, but also be able to couple strongly to other bright excitons. Our results explain the occurrence of two strong peaks in the SHG of monolayer h-BN and why the A and B excitons of MoS2 unexpectedly exhibit minimal excitonic enhancement in both SHG and shift current generation.

Title: Nonequilibrium Dynamics of Dirac Quantum Criticality in Imaginary Time
Authors: Yin-Kai Yu, Zhi Zeng, Yu-Rong Shu, Zi-Xiang Li, Shuai Yin
Abstract: Quantum criticality within Dirac fermions harbors a plethora of exotic phenomena, attracting sustained attention in the past decades. Here, we explore the imaginary-time relaxation dynamics in a typical Dirac quantum criticality belonging to chiral Heisenberg universality class. Performing large-scale quantum Monte Carlo simulation, we unveil rich nonequilibrium critical phenomena from different initial states. In particular, we identify a non-stationary initial slip evolution characterized by an unconventional negative critical exponent $\theta=-0.84(4)$, corroborating the significant impact of fermionic critical fluctuations. Furthermore, we generalize the nonequilibrium scaling theory to incorporate both fermionic and bosonic critical modes, capturing their distinct relaxation behaviors. Armed with the scaling theory, we establish a new framework to investigate fermionic quantum criticality based on short-time dynamics, paving a promising avenue to fathoming quantum criticality in diverse fermionic systems with high efficiency.

Title: Intermediates of Forming Transition Metal Dichalcogenide Heterostructures Revealed by Machine Learning Simulations
Authors: Luneng Zhao, Hongsheng Liu, Yuan Chang, Xiaoran Shi, Jijun Zhao, Feng Ding, Junfeng Gao
Abstract: Two-dimensional (2D) transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) van der Waals heterostructures (vdWHs) hold promise for high-performance electronics, but their large-scale synthesis remains limited by size constraints and alloying contaminations. Recently, a two-step vapor deposition method was reported for growing wafer-size TMD vdWHs with minimal impurities. In this study, we develop a machine learning potential (MLP) that accurately captures the atomic-scale dynamic growth process of bilayer MoS$_2$/WS$_2$ vdWHs under feasible growth conditions. Our simulations uncover a crucial metastable SMMS (M = Mo or W) intermediate structure that facilitates metal atom swap and alloying. Eliminating the alloying contamination requires preventing the embedding of bare metal atoms. The results also show that the SMMS structure exhibits favourable electronic properties and emerges as a low Schottky barrier contact electrode for MoS$_2$ field-effect transistors (FETs).

Title: Dynamics of Topological Defects in Type-II Superconductors under Gradients of Temperature/Spin Density
Authors: Takuma Kanakubo, Hiroto Adachi, Masanori Ichioka, Yusuke Kato
Abstract: We theoretically investigate the motion of a domain wall and a vortex in type-II superconductors driven by inhomogeneities of temperature or spin density. The model consists of the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equation and the thermal/spin diffusion equation, whose transport coefficients (the thermal/spin conductivity and the spin relaxation time) depend on the order parameter, interpolating between values in the superconducting and normal states. Numerical and analytical calculations indicate that the domain wall moves toward the higher-temperature/spin-density region, where the order parameter is suppressed. We also derive an analytical expression for the vortex velocity. We can understand the dynamics of topological defects as processes that reduce the loss of condensation energy. We also analyze the driving force, the viscous force, the thermal force, and the force due to the spin accumulation gradient, on the basis of the momentum balance relations.

Title: Imaging topological polar structures in marginally twisted 2D semiconductors

Muir, Linnan Jia, Jeffrey A. Davis, Kenji Watanabe, Takashi Taniguchi, Shaffique Adam, Pankaj Sharma, Michael S. Fuhrer, Mark T. Edmonds
Abstract: Moire superlattices formed in van der Waals heterostructures due to twisting, lattice mismatch and strain present an opportunity for creating novel metamaterials with unique properties not present in the individual layers themselves. Ferroelectricity for example, arises due to broken inversion symmetry in twisted and strained bilayers of 2D semiconductors with stacking domains of alternating out-of-plane polarization. However, understanding the individual contributions of twist and strain to the formation of topological polar nanostructures remains to be established and has proven to be experimentally challenging. Inversion symmetry breaking has been predicted to give rise to an in-plane component of polarization along the domain walls, leading to the formation of a network of topologically non-trivial merons (half-skyrmions) that are Bloch-type for twisted and Neel-type for strained systems. Here we utilise angle-resolved, high-resolution vector piezoresponse force microscopy (PFM) to spatially resolve polarization components and topological polar nanostructures in marginally twisted bilayer WSe2, and provide experimental proof for the existence of topologically non-trivial meron/antimeron structures. We observe both Bloch-type and Neel-type merons, allowing us to differentiate between moire superlattices formed due to twist or heterogeneous strain. This first demonstration of non-trivial real-space topology in a twisted van der Waals heterostructure opens pathways for exploring the connection between twist and topology in engineered nano-devices.

Title: Hermitian and non-Hermitian topology in active matter
Authors: Kazuki Sone, Kazuki Yokomizo, Kyogo Kawaguchi, Yuto Ashida
Abstract: Self-propulsion is a quintessential aspect of biological systems, which can induce nonequilibrium phenomena that have no counterparts in passive systems. Motivated by biophysical interest together with recent advances in experimental techniques, active matter has been a rapidly developing field in physics. Meanwhile, over the past few decades, topology has played a crucial role to understand certain robust properties appearing in condensed matter systems. For instance, the nontrivial topology of band structures leads to the notion of topological insulators, where one can find robust gapless edge modes protected by the bulk band topology. We here review recent progress in an interdisciplinary area of research at the intersection of these two fields. Specifically, we give brief introductions to active matter and band topology in Hermitian systems, and then explain how the notion of band topology can be extended to nonequilibrium (and thus non-Hermitian) systems including active matter. We review recent studies that have demonstrated the intimate connections between active matter and topological materials, where exotic topological phenomena that are unfeasible in passive systems have been found. A possible extension of the band topology to nonlinear systems is also briefly discussed. Active matter can thus provide an ideal playground to explore topological phenomena in qualitatively new realms beyond conservative linear systems.

Title: Temperature-activated dislocation avalanches signaling brittle-to-ductile transition in BCC micropillars
Authors: Yang Li, Inam Lalani, Matthew Maron, William Hixson, Biao Wang, Nasr Ghoniem, Giacomo Po
Abstract: We carry out strain-controlled in-situ compression experiments of micron-sized tungsten (W) micropillars in the temperature range 300-900 K, together with simulations of three-dimensional discrete dislocation dynamics (DDD) at the same scale. Two distinct regimes are observed. At low temperatures, plastic deformation appears smooth, both temporally and spatially. Stress fluctuations are consistent with a Wiener stochastic process resulting from uncorrelated dislocation activity within the pillars. However, high-temperature stress fluctuations are highly correlated and exhibit features of self-organized criticality (SOC), with deformation located within well-defined slip bands. The high-temperature stress relaxation statistics are consistent with a thermally activated nucleation process from the surface. The nature of the transition between the two regimes is a manifestation of the brittle to ductile transition in BCC metals.

Title: Disorder-induced spin-cluster magnetism in a doped kagome spin liquid candidate
Authors: Arnab Seth, Joseph C. Prestigiacomo, Aini Xu, Zhenyuan Zeng, Trevor D. Ford, B.S. Shivaram, Shiliang Li, Patrick A. Lee, Itamar Kimchi
Abstract: The search for new quantum spin liquid materials relies on systems with strong frustration such as spins on an ideal kagome lattice. However, lattice imperfections can have substantial effects which are as yet not well understood. In recent work, the two-dimensional kagome system YCu$_3$(OH)$_6$[(Cl$_x$Br$_{(1-x)}$)$_{3-y}$(OH)$_y$] has emerged as a leading candidate hosting a Dirac spin liquid which appears to survive at least for x<0.4, associated with alternating-bond hexagon (ABH) disorder. Here in magnetic samples with x=0.58, y=0.1 we report unusual in-plane ferromagnetic canting (FM) of the in-plane antiferromagnet (AFM), with an unusually wide regime of short-ranged order, and propose theoretical models to explain this behavior. First, we show that Kitaev type exchanges naturally arise on the kagome lattice to second order in the known Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya exchanges, and that these interactions can produce the unusual in-plane FM canting from antichiral AFM. Second, we propose a phenomenological model of weakly-FM-canted spin clusters to describe the short-ranged regime and analyze quantum fluctuations in an ABH toy model to show how ABH disorder can stabilize this regime. The combination of experimental observation and theory suggests that kagome-Kitaev interactions and ABH disorder are necessary for describing the magnetic fluctuations in this family of materials, with potential implications for the proposed proximate spin liquid phase.

Title: Spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy measurement scheme for determining the quantum geometric tensor
Authors: Shu-Hui Zhang, Jin Yang, Ding-Fu Shao, Jia-Ji Zhu, Wen-Long You, Wen Yang, Kai Chang
Abstract: The quantum geometric tensor (QGT) embodies the geometry of the eigenstates of a system's Hamiltonian, and its full characterization across diverse quantum systems is essential. However, it is challenging to characterize the QGT of solid-state systems. Here we present an electric scheme to measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized scanning tunneling microscopy (STM), in which the spin texture is extracted from geometric amplitudes of Friedel oscillations induced by the intentionally introduced magnetic impurity, and then the QGT is derived from the momentum differential of spin texture. As a canonical spin model, the surface states of a topological insulator offer a promising way to demonstrate the scheme. In a slab of topological insulator, the gapped surface states host complete QGT, i.e., nonvanishing quantum metric and Berry curvature as its symmetric real part and the antisymmetric imaginary part. Thus, a detailed derivation guides the use of the developed scheme to measure the QGT of gapped surface states, even with an external magnetic field. This study opens a new avenue to directly measure the complete QGT of two-dimensional solid-state systems by using spin-polarized STM.

Title: Braiding Majoranas in a linear quantum dot-superconductor array: Mitigating the errors from Coulomb repulsion and residual tunneling
Authors: Sebastian Miles, Francesco Zatelli, A. Mert Bozkurt, Michael Wimmer, Chun-Xiao Liu
Abstract: Exchanging the positions of two non-Abelian anyons transforms between many-body wavefunctions within a degenerate ground-state manifold. This behavior is fundamentally distinct from fermions, bosons and Abelian anyons. Recently, quantum dot-superconductor arrays have emerged as a promising platform for creating topological Kitaev chains that can host non-Abelian Majorana zero modes. In this work, we propose a minimal braiding setup in a linear array of quantum dots consisting of two minimal Kitaev chains coupled through an ancillary, normal quantum dot. We focus on the physical effects that are peculiar to quantum dot devices, such as interdot Coulomb repulsion and residual single electron tunneling. We find that the errors caused by either of these effects can be efficiently mitigated by optimal control of the ancillary quantum dot that mediates the exchange of the non-Abelian anyons. Moreover, we propose experimentally accessible methods to find this optimal operating regime and predict signatures of a successful Majorana braiding experiment.

Title: Enhancement of damping in a turbulent atomic Bose-Einstein condensate
Authors: Junghoon Lee, Jongmin Kim, Jongheum Jung, Yong-il Shin
Abstract: Turbulence enhances momentum transport in classical fluids, effectively increasing their viscosity. We investigate an analogous effect in a superfluid by measuring the damping of collective oscillations in an atomic Bose-Einstein condensate (BEC) containing stationary spin-superflow turbulence. Using continuous spin driving to maintain turbulence in a spin-1 $^{23}$Na BEC, we excite its quadrupole mode and measure the damping rate over a range of temperatures. The damping consistently exceeds the Landau-damping rate expected for an equilibrium, non-turbulent BEC. The enhancement likely originates from two complementary processes: direct energy transfer from the mode to turbulent condensate fluctuations and turbulence-induced modification of the thermal cloud that amplifies Landau damping. These results establish collective-mode damping as a sensitive probe of momentum transport in superfluid turbulence.

Title: Phases and criticality of the triangular lattice SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model
Authors: Lu Zhang, Rongning Liu, Xue-Yang Song
Abstract: We report the study of phases and transitions of SU(N) Hofstadter-Hubbard model subject to commensurate magnetic field on the triangular lattice. At filling one fermion per site, for the number of fermion flavors 2 <= N <= 8, we identify three distinct phases and calculate critical interaction strength from parton large-N mean-field approximation. Integer quantum Hall, chiral spin liquid, and valence bond solid states could be realized upon varying the Hubbard interaction U and the number of flavor N . We construct the critical theory for the putative continuous transition from quantum Hall states to chiral spin liquid and calculate the critical transport behavior using quantum Boltzmann equations for general N . These results could be validated in synthetic systems such as moire superlattices and cold atom platforms.

Title: Suppression and enhancement of bosonic stimulation by atomic interactions
Authors: Konstantinos Konstantinou, Yansheng Zhang, Paul H. C. Wong, Feiyang Wang, Yu-Kun Lu, Nishant Dogra, Christoph Eigen, Tanish Satoor, Wolfgang Ketterle, Zoran Hadzibabic
Abstract: The tendency of identical bosons to bunch, seen in the Hanbury Brown-Twiss effect and Bose-Einstein condensation, is a hallmark of quantum statistics. This bunching can enhance the rates of fundamental processes such as atom-atom and atom-light scattering when atoms scatter into already occupied states. For non-interacting bosons, the enhancement of light scattering follows directly from the occupation of the atom's final momentum state. Here, we study scattering between off-resonant light and atoms in a quasi-homogeneous Bose gas with tunable interactions and show that even weak interactions, which do not significantly alter the momentum distribution, strongly affect atom-light scattering. Changes in local atomic correlations suppress the bosonic enhancement under weak repulsive interactions and increase the scattering rate under attractive ones. Moreover, if the interactions are rapidly tuned, light scattering reveals correlation dynamics that are orders of magnitude faster than the collisional dynamics of the momentum-space populations. Its extreme sensitivity to correlation effects makes off-resonant light scattering a powerful probe of many-body physics in ultracold atomic gases.

Title: Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors
Authors: Bill P. Truong, Kartiek Agarwal, T. Pereg-Barnea
Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this transport by tuning a single section of a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. We show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap which is suppressed in the presence of disorder. The increase in diabatic error can be several orders of magnitude and is most deleterious when the disorder correlation length is a finite fraction of the transport distance and negligible when these lengths are far apart. In the presence of noise, the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.

Title: Light-induced Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs in unconventional magnets
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Sayan Mondal, Jun-Feng Liu, Jorge Cayao
Abstract: The recently predicted unconventional magnets offer a new ground for exploring the formation of nontrivial spin states due to their inherent nonrelativistic momentum-dependent spin splitting. In this work, we consider unconventional magnets with $d$- and $p$-wave parities, and investigate the effect of time-periodic light drives for inducing the formation of spin-triplet phases in the normal and superconducting states. In particular, we consider unconventional magnets without and with conventional superconductivity under linearly and circularly polarized light drives and treat the time-dependent problem within Floquet formalism, which naturally unveils photon processes and Floquet bands determining the emergent phenomena. We demonstrate that the interplay between unconventional magnetism and light gives rise to a non-trivial light-matter coupling which governs the emergence of Floquet spin-triplet states with and without superconductivity that are absent otherwise. We find that photon-assisted processes promote the formation of spin-triplet densities and spin-triplet Cooper pairs between different Floquet sidebands. More precisely, the Floquet sidebands offer an additional quantum number, the Floquet index, which considerably broadens the classification of superconducting correlations that lead to Floquet spin-triplet Cooper pairs as an entirely dynamical phenomenon due to the interplay between light and unconventional magnetism. Furthermore, we discuss how the number of photons is connected to the symmetry of Cooper pairs and also explore how the distinct light drives can be used to manipulate them and probe the angular symmetry of unconventional magnets. Our results therefore unveil the potential of unconventional magnets for realizing nontrivial light-induced superconducting states.

Title: Density-Independent transient caging in the high-density phase of motility-induced phase separation
Authors: Toranosuke Umemura, Issei Sakai, Takuma Akimoto
Abstract: We investigate the nonequilibrium dynamics of active matter using a two-dimensional active Brownian particles model. In these systems, self-propelled particles undergo motility-induced phase separation (MIPS), spontaneously segregating into dense and dilute phases. We find that in the high-density phase, local particle mobility exhibits transient caging, with diffusivity remaining unchanged despite variations in the global system density. As global density increases further, the system undergoes a transition to a solid-like state through an intermediate regime with pronounced dynamical arrest. Our findings identify a distinct high-density regime characterized by transient caging and dynamical slowing down in a monodisperse active system, shedding new light on the connection between MIPS and nonequilibrium arrest.

Title: Anomalous Energy Injection in the Gross-Pitaevskii Framework for Turbulence in Neutron Star Glitches
Authors: Anirudh Sivakumar, Pankaj Kumar Mishra, Ahmad A. Hujeirat, Paulsamy Muruganandam
Abstract: Neutron star glitches -- sudden increases in rotational frequency -- are thought to result from angular momentum transfer via quantized vortices in the superfluid core. To investigate the underlying superfluid dynamics, we employ a two-dimensional rotating atomic Bose-Einstein condensate described by a damped Gross-Pitaevskii equation with an imposed pinning potential that serves as a simplified analogue of a crust. Within this minimal framework, we examine the emergence and evolution of turbulent vortex motion following impulsive perturbations reminiscent of glitch-like forcing. Our simulations reveal a transient Kolmogorov-like turbulent cascade ($k^{-5/3}$) that transitions to a Vinen-like scaling ($k^{-1}$). We identify an anomalous secondary injection mechanism driven primarily by quantum pressure, which can sustain turbulent fluctuations in such a system. By tuning the damping coefficient $\gamma$, we determine an optimal regime for energy transfer. While idealized, these findings illustrate how quantum turbulence with multiple scaling regimes can arise in pinned, rotating superfluids, and they suggest possible qualitative connections to vortex-mediated dynamics in neutron stars and other astrophysical superfluid systems.

Title: A molecule with half-Möbius topology

Abstract: Stereoisomers of C$_{13}$Cl$_2$ exhibiting helical orbitals around a ring of carbon atoms were synthesized by atom manipulation on NaCl surfaces. We resolved the enantiomeric geometries of the singlet states by atomic force microscopy and mapped their helical orbital densities by scanning tunnelling microscopy. A ${\pi}$-orbital basis of the helical, non-planar singlets that twists by 90° in one circulation is consistent with a half-Möbius topology. In such a topology, the ${\pi}$-orbital basis changes sign with respect to two circumnavigations and is periodic with respect to four circumnavigations. A quasiparticle on a ring with this boundary condition could be interpreted as carrying a Berry phase of ${\pi}$/2. We demonstrate reversible switching of the topology, between the two singlets of oppositely threaded half-Möbius topology, and the planar, topologically trivial, triplet state. Multireference calculations, including large-scale sample-based ab initio calculations executed on quantum hardware, reveal that the switching is associated with a helical pseudo Jahn-Teller effect.

Authors: Félix Fossati, Evgeny A. Stepanov
Abstract: In this work, we extend the dual triply irreducible local expansion (D-TRILEX) approach for correlated electronic systems by introducing a cluster reference system for the diagrammatic expansion. This framework allows us to consistently combine the exact treatment of short-range correlation effects within the cluster, with an efficient diagrammatic description of the long-range charge and spin collective fluctuations beyond the cluster. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach by applying it to the one-dimensional nano-ring Hubbard model, where the low dimensionality enhances non-local correlations. Our results show that the cluster extension of D-TRILEX accurately reproduces the electronic self-energy at momenta corresponding to the Fermi energy, in good agreement with the reliable Hirsch-Fye quantum Monte Carlo solution of the problem. We further compare this method with the more computationally demanding parquet dynamical vertex approximation and find that, our method yields substantially more accurate results at momenta associated with the Fermi surface. We show that the D-TRILEX diagrammatic extension drastically reduces the periodization ambiguity of cluster quantities when mapping back to the original lattice, compared to cluster dynamical mean-field theory (CDMFT). Furthermore, we identify the CDMFT impurity problem as the main source of the translational-symmetry breaking and propose a computational scheme for improving the starting point for the cluster-diagrammatic expansion.

Title: Dynamic competition between phason and amplitudon observed by ultrafast multimodal scanning tunneling microscopy
Authors: Seokjin Bae, Arjun Raghavan, Soyeun Kim, Kejian Qu, Chengxi Zhao, Daniel P. Shoemaker, Ziqiang Wang, Fahad Mahmood, Barry Bradlyn, Vidya Madhavan
Abstract: The intertwining between two ordered states that arise from the same interactions is reflected in the dynamics of their coupled collective excitations. While the equilibrium phase diagram resulting from such intertwined orders has been extensively studied, the dynamic competition between non-equilibrium modes is a largely unexplored territory. Here, we introduce a multimodal STM-based pump-probe technique, that combines ultrafast tunneling microscopy (USTM), ultrafast point-contact spectroscopy (UPC), and optical pump-probe reflectance (OPPR) on femtosecond timescale, all within a single instrument. Using this platform, we investigate the collective excitations of the unconventional charge density wave insulator (TaSe4)2I. Our UPC measurements reveal charge oscillations at 0.22 THz, with a temperature dependence that matches the theoretically predicted behavior of the long-sought massive phason gaining mass through the Anderson-Higgs mechanism. Unexpectedly, the data also reveals a second mode at 0.11 THz exhibiting similar temperature and polarization dependence with comparable mode intensity. These features, along with the robust 1/2 frequency ratio locking suggest that the 0.11 THz phason is a 'daughter mode' that arises from the splitting of the 0.22 THz massive phason into two massless phasons via parametric amplification, analogous to the decay of a neutral pion into two photons. Strikingly, comparison with OPPR data reveals that the daughter phason competes with and suppresses the amplitudon at proximate frequency. Our studies reveal an unexplored mechanism for the generation and extinction of collective excitations in quantum materials and pave the way for a microscopic understanding of ultrafast phenomena.

Title: Enhancement of Josephson Supercurrent in a $π$-Junction state by Chiral Antiferromagnetism
Authors: Jin-Xing Hou, Hai-Peng Sun, Björn Trauzettel, Song-Bo Zhang
Abstract: Magnetic order typically disrupts superconductivity, reducing the supercurrent. Here, we show that chiral antiferromagnetism, with non-relativistic spin-split bands and distinctive valley-locked spin texture, can instead significantly enhance Josephson supercurrents. This enhancement stems from the emergence of dominant equal-spin triplet pairing and strong fluctuations of singlet pairing in momentum space, both induced by chiral antiferromagnetism. We demonstrate these results in Josephson junctions composed of chiral antiferromagnetic metals and conventional superconductors on kagome lattices. Furthermore, we show that the enhanced Josephson supercurrent is stabilized in a $\pi$-junction state. These phenomena persist across a broad energy range and remain stable for different temperatures and junction lengths. Our results unveil a previously unexplored mechanism for enhancing supercurrent by strong magnetic order and provide crucial insights into the large Josephson currents observed in Mn$_3$Ge.

Title: Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets
Authors: Tongshuai Zhu, Di Zhou, Huaiqiang Wang, Su-Huai Wei, Jiawei Ruan
Abstract: Altermagnets (AMs), recently discovered unconventional magnets distinct from both ferro- and antiferromagnets, have rapidly emerged as a prominent research topic in condensed matter physics. AMs are characterized by alternating collinear magnetic moments with zero net magnetization in real space, and spin splittings with even-parity symmetry in momentum space. However, their counterparts exhibiting odd-parity spin splittings are generally thought to be absent in collinear magnets. Here, we show that such unconventional odd-parity magnets can be induced from collinear antiferromagnets by symmetry engineering. Remarkably, using effective model analysis within Floquet-theory framework, we demonstrate that circularly polarized light irradiation of conventional antiferromagnetic lattices breaks a spin-preserving pseudo-time-reversal symmetry and induces both $p$- and $f$-wave magnets, realizing novel magnetic states dubbed Floquet odd-parity collinear magnets. Moreover, we also uncover light-induced antiferromagnetic Chern insulating states in the $f$-wave magnets. The proposed Floquet odd-parity magnet is confirmed by first-principles calculations of MnPSe$_{3}$ under circularly polarized light. Our work not only proposes a new class of unconventional magnets, but also opens an avenue for light-induced magnetic phenomena in spintronic applications.

Title: Semi-Dirac spin liquids and frustrated quantum magnetism on the trellis lattice
Authors: Sourin Chatterjee, Atanu Maity, Janik Potten, Tobias Müller, Andreas Feuerpfeil, Ronny Thomale, Karlo Penc, Harald O. Jeschke, Rhine Samajdar, Yasir Iqbal
Abstract: Geometrical frustration in quantum magnets provides a fertile setting for unconventional phases of matter, including quantum spin liquids (QSLs). The trellis lattice, with its complex site arrangements and edge-sharing triangular motifs, presents a promising platform for such physics. In this work, we undertake a comprehensive classification of all fully symmetric QSLs on the trellis lattice using the projective symmetry group approach within the Abrikosov-fermion representation. We find 7 U(1) and 25 $Z_2$ short-ranged Ansätze and analyze the phase diagram in the mean-field parameter space, uncovering both gapped and Dirac QSLs as well as a semi-Dirac spin liquid that emerges at the level of projective symmetry group classification and mean-field band structure, in which the spinon dispersion is linear along one momentum direction but quadratic along the orthogonal one. We demonstrate that such dispersions can occur only at high-symmetry points in the Brillouin zone with $C_{2v}$ little groups and analyze their characteristic correlation signatures. Moreover, by optimizing over all symmetry-allowed mean-field states, we map out a phase diagram -- featuring six distinct phases -- of the nearest-neighbor Heisenberg Hamiltonian on the trellis lattice. Among these, we find four quasi-one-dimensional QSL phases, one dimer phase, and one Dirac QSL phase. Going beyond mean field, we also assess equal-time and dynamical spin structure factors of these phases using density-matrix renormalization group and Keldysh pseudofermion functional renormalization group calculations and compare qualitative momentum-space features of these spectra with those obtained at the mean-field level. Finally, we identify four cuprate and vanadate compounds as promising experimental realizations and provide spectroscopic predictions, based on first-principles Hamiltonians, as a guide for neutron-scattering studies.

Title: Prediction of several Co-based La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$-like superconducting materials
Authors: Jing-Xuan Wang, Yi-Heng Tian, Jian-Hong She, Rong-Qiang He, Zhong-Yi Lu
Abstract: High-temperature superconductivity has been found in Fe-, Ni-, and Cu-based compounds but has remained elusive in Co-based materials. The recent discovery of superconductivity in pressurized bilayer nickelate La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_7$ has renewed interest in related layered systems. Here, we predict several Co-based analogs that may realize similar physics. Electron doping of the high-pressure bilayer cobaltate La$_3$Co$_2$O$_7$ yields LaTh$_2$Co$_2$O$_7$, La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Cl$_2$, and La$_3$Ni$_2$O$_5$Br$_2$, which exhibit closely related crystal structures and strongly correlated electronic states. Random-phase-approximation calculations reveal $s$-wave as the leading pairing symmetry in these compounds.

Title: First principles band structure of interacting phosphorus and boron/aluminum $δ$-doped layers in silicon
Authors: Quinn T. Campbell, Andrew D. Baczewski, Shashank Misra, Evan M. Anderson
Abstract: Silicon can be heavily doped with phosphorus in a single atomic layer (a $\delta$ layer), significantly altering the electronic structure of the conduction bands within the material. Recent progress has also made it possible to further dope silicon with acceptor-based $\delta$ layers using either boron or aluminum, making it feasible to create devices with interacting $\delta$ layers with opposite polarity. Using Density Functional Theory, we calculate the electronic structure of a phosphorus-based $\delta$ layer interacting with a boron or aluminum $\delta$ layer, varying the distances between the $\delta$ layers. At separations 1 nm and smaller, the dopant potentials overlap and largely cancel each other out, leading to an electronic structure closely mimicking intrinsic silicon. At separations greater than 1 nm, the two $\delta$ layers behave independently of one another, with an equivalent electronic structure to a p-n diode with an intrinsic layer taking the place of the depletion region. One mechanism for charge transfer between $\delta$ layers at larger distances could be tunneling, where we see a tunneling probability exceeding what would be seen for a standard silicon 1.1 eV triangular barrier, indicating that the interaction between delta layers may enhance tunneling compared to a traditional junction.

Title: Active-Learning Inspired $\textit{Ab Initio}$ Theory-Experiment Loop Approach for Management of Material Defects: Application to Superconducting Qubits

Abstract: Surface oxides are associated with two-level systems (TLSs) that degrade the performance of niobium-based superconducting quantum computing devices. To address this, we introduce a predictive framework for selecting metal capping layers that inhibit niobium oxide formation. Using DFT-calculated oxygen interstitial and vacancy energies as thermodynamic descriptors, we train a logistic regression model on a limited set of experimental outcomes to successfully predict the likelihood of oxide formation beneath different capping materials. This approach identifies Zr, Hf, and Ta as effective diffusion barriers. Our analysis further reveals that the oxide formation energy per oxygen atom serves as an excellent standalone descriptor for predicting barrier performance. By combining this new descriptor with lattice mismatch as a secondary criterion to promote structurally coherent interfaces, we identify Zr, Ta, and Sc as especially promising candidates. This closed-loop strategy integrates first-principles theory, machine learning, and limited experimental data to enable rational design of next-generation materials.

Title: Quasi-adiabatic thermal ensemble preparation in the thermodynamic limit
Authors: Tatsuhiko Shirai
Abstract: We investigate a quasi-adiabatic thermal process for preparing finite-temperature ensembles in the thermodynamic limit. The process gradually transforms a thermal ensemble of a noninteracting system into that of an interacting system of interest over a finite operation time, with the temperature controlled by parameters associated with the entropy of the initial state. We analyze this process in both nonintegrable and integrable spin chains with translational invariance. For the nonintegrable case, numerical simulations combined with a thermodynamic argument indicate that the thermal properties of local observables are accurately reproduced with a single parameter, although the operation time increases exponentially with precision. In contrast, for the integrable transverse-field Ising model, we analytically show that an extensive number of parameters tied to local conserved quantities is generally necessary, and the performance is affected by the presence of a quantum phase transition. These results clarify the potential and limitations of the quasi-adiabatic thermal process for an ensemble preparation and highlight the role of integrability in determining its efficiency.

Title: Dynamic Phase Transitions in Mean-Field Ginzburg-Landau Models: Conjugate Fields and Fourier-Mode Scaling
Authors: Yelyzaveta Satynska, Daniel T. Robb
Abstract: Dynamic phase transitions of periodically forced mean-field ferromagnets are often described by a single order parameter and a scalar conjugate field. Building from previous work, we show that, at the critical period $P_c$ of the mean-field Ginzburg-Landau (MFGL) dynamics with energy $F(m)=am^2+bm^4-hm$, the correct conjugate field is the entire even-Fourier component part of the applied field. The correct order parameter is $z_k=\sqrt{\bigl|\,m_k^2-|m_{k,c}|^2\,\bigr|}$, where $m_k$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component of the magnetization m(t), and $m_{k,c}$ is the $k^{th}$ Fourier component at the critical period. Using high-accuracy limit-cycle integration and Fourier analysis, we first confirm that, for periodic fields that contain only odd components, the symmetry-broken branch below $P_c$ exhibits $z_k \propto \varepsilon^{1/2}$ (computationally tested for modes $k\le30$), where $\varepsilon=(P_c-P)/P_c$. This provides strong evidence that the 1/2 scaling holds for all Fourier modes. We then find three robust facts: (1) Exactly at $P_c$, adding a small perturbation composed of even Fourier components with an overall field multiplier $h_{mult}$ yields $z_k \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ across many $k$. (2) Mode-resolved deviations obey a parity rule: $|\delta m_{2n}| \propto h_{mult}^{1/3}$ and $|\delta m_{2n+1}| \propto h_{mult}^{2/3}$. (3) These scalings persist in two MFGL models with higher-order nonlinearities.

Title: Role of on-site Coulomb energy and negative-charge transfer in a Dirac semi-metal NiTe$_2$
Authors: A. R. Shelke, C.-W. Chuang, S. Hamamoto, M. Oura, M. Yoshimura, N. Hiraoka, C.-N. Kuo, C.-S. Lue, A. Fujimori, A. Chainani
Abstract: Angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy (ARPES) combined with band structure calculations have shown that the layered transition metal dichalcogenide(TMD) NiTe$_2$ is a type-II Dirac semimetal. However, conflicting conclusions were reported regarding the role of electron correlations in NiTe$_2$. We study core-levels and valence band electronic structure of single crystal NiTe$_2$ using soft and hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy(SXPES, HAXPES), X-ray absorption spectroscopy(XAS) and Ni $2p-3d$ Resonant-PES to quantify electronic parameters in NiTe$_2$. The Ni $3d$ on-site Coulomb energy ($U_{dd}$) is quantified from measurements of the Ni $3d$ single particle density of states(DOS) and the two-hole correlation satellite. The Ni $2p$ core level and $L$-edge XAS spectra are analyzed by charge-transfer (CT) cluster model calculations using the experimental $U_{dd}$, and it shows that NiTe$_2$ exhibits a negative CT energy $\Delta$. A comparative analysis of NiO $L$-edge XAS confirms its well-known strongly correlated CT insulator character, with a larger $U_{dd}$ and positive $\Delta$. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for NiTe$_2$$<$NiO, and shows that $T_{eg}$ is not responsible for reducing $U_{dd}$ in NiTe\textsubscript{2} compared to NiO. The negative-$\Delta$ and a reduced $U_{dd}$ leads to the increase in $d^n$ count on the Ni site in NiTe$_{2}$ by nearly one electron. However, importantly, since $U_{dd}$$>$$|\Delta|$, a finite repulsive $U_{dd}$ results in pushing $d$-states away from Fermi level and this is required to make NiTe$_{2}$ a moderately correlated Dirac semi-metal with band inversion in the $p$-$p$ type lowest energy excitations.

Title: The nexus between negative charge-transfer and reduced on-site Coulomb energy in a correlated topological metal CoTe$_2$
Authors: A. R. Shelke, C.-W. Chuang, S. Hamamoto, M. Oura, M. Yoshimura, N. Hiraoka, C.-N. Kuo, C.-S. Lue, A. Fujimori, A. Chainani
Abstract: The layered $3d$ transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) CoTe$_2$ is a topological Dirac Type-II metal. However, the Co $3d$-bands in CoTe$_2$ do not exhibit the expected correlation-induced band narrowing seen in CoO. We address this conundrum by studying the electronic structure of CoTe$_2$ using hard x-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) and Resonant-PES. We quantify the on-site Coulomb energy $U_{dd}$ via single-particle partial density of states and the two-hole correlation satellite using valence band Resonant-PES), and obtain $U_{dd}$ = 3.0 eV for CoTe$_2$. Charge-transfer (CT) cluster model simulations of the measured core-level Co $2p$ PES and $L$-edge XAS spectra of CoTe\textsubscript{2} and CoO validate their contrasting electronic parameters:$U_{dd}$ and CT energy $\Delta$ are (3.0 eV, -2.0 eV) for CoTe\textsubscript{2}, and (5.0 eV, 4.0 eV) for CoO, respectively. The $d$-$p$ hybridization strength $T_{eg}$ for CoTe$_2$$<$CoO, and indicates that the reduced $U_{dd}$ in CoTe\textsubscript{2} is not due to $T_{eg}$. The increase in $d^n$-count$\sim$1 by CT from ligand to Co site in CoTe$_2$ is due to a negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$. Yet, only because $U_{dd}$$>$$\big|\Delta\big|$, CoTe$_{2}$ becomes a topological metal with $p$$\rightarrow$$p$ type lowest energy excitations. The study reveals the nexus between negative-$\Delta$ and reduced $U_{dd}$ required for setting up the electronic structure framework for achieving topological behavior via band inversion in the correlated metal CoTe$_2$.

Title: General spin models from noncollinear spin density functional theory and spin-cluster expansion
Authors: Tomonori Tanaka, Yoshihiro Gohda
Abstract: We present a data-efficient framework for constructing general classical spin Hamiltonians by combining the spin-cluster expansion (SCE) with fully self-consistent noncollinear spin density functional theory (DFT). The key idea is to fit the SCE model to magnetic torques rather than to total energies. Because torques are site-resolved vectors, each spin configuration provides many informative regression targets, improving conditioning and substantially reducing the number of required DFT calculations, especially for large supercells. Applied to the B20-type chiral magnets ${\rm Mn}_{1-x}{\rm Fe}_{x}{\rm Ge}$ and ${\rm Fe}_{1-y}{\rm Co}_{y}{\rm Ge}$, the resulting SCE models determine full pairwise exchange tensors -- including isotropic exchange, symmetric anisotropic exchange, and the Dzyaloshinskii--Moriya interaction -- and predict the helical spin period via a micromagnetic mapping. The composition trends and the divergence of the period at the chirality sign-change point are well reproduced, in agreement with experiment. Moreover, the systematic nature of SCE enables controlled assessment of interaction order: as the training spin configurations become more disordered, the lowest-order model loses torque accuracy, whereas including higher-order interactions restores predictive power. These advances enable near-DFT-accurate spin models for finite-temperature magnetism and complex spin textures at modest computational cost, providing an extensible route to quantitative first-principles parameterization and predictive materials design. An open-source implementation is available as a Julia package, \textit{this http URL}.

Title: Direct Observation of the Spillover of High Magnetic Field-induced SC3 Superconductivity Outside the Spin-Polarized State in UTe2
Authors: Zheyu Wu, Hanyi Chen, Theodore I. Weinberger, Mengmeng Long, David Graf, Andrej Cabala, Vladimir Sechovsky, Michal Valiska, Gilbert G. Lonzarich, F. Malte Grosche, Alexander G. Eaton
Abstract: In our recent study of the high magnetic field phase landscape of UTe$_2$ [Phys. Rev. X 15, 021019 (2025)] we found indirect evidence that the SC3 superconducting phase spills out beyond the first-order phase boundary of the spin-polarized state. This prior study was limited to a maximal field strength of 41.5 T, and mapped the $b-ac$ rotation plane. Here we measure a high quality sample with residual resistivity ratio RRR = 605 under rotations in the $b-c$ plane up to 45 T. This extended field range helps to unambiguously demonstrate the spillover of SC3 outside the polarized paramagnetic state. This is identified by the observation of zero resistance at low temperatures, for magnetic field strengths lower than the metamagnetic transition field resolved at higher temperatures. This observation is consistent with the scenario that electronic pairing of the SC3 phase is mediated by quantum critical fluctuations.

Title: Frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function of IDTBT single-molecule fluorescence
Authors: Quanwei Li, Yuping Shi, Lam Lam, K. Birgitta Whaley, Graham Fleming
Abstract: The frequency- and time-resolved second order quantum coherence function (g(2)({\tau})) of single-molecule fluorescence has recently been proposed as a powerful new quantum light spectroscopy that can reveal intrinsic quantum coherence in excitation energy transfer in molecular systems ranging from simple dimers to photosynthetic complexes. Yet, no experiments have been reported to date. Here, we have developed a single-molecule fluorescence g(2)({\tau}) quantum light spectroscopy (SMFg2-QLS) that can simultaneously measure the fluorescence intensity, lifetime, spectra, and g(2)({\tau}) with frequency resolution, for a single molecule in a controlled environment at both room temperature and cryogenic temperature. As a proof of principle, we have studied single molecules of IDTBT (indacenodithiophene-co-benzothiadiazole), a semiconducting donor-acceptor conjugated copolymer with a chain-like structure that shows a high carrier mobility and annihilation-limited long-range exciton transport. We have observed different g(2)({\tau}=0) values with different bands or bandwidths of the single molecule IDTBT fluorescence. The general features are consistent with theoretical predictions and suggest non-trivial excited state quantum dynamics, possibly showing quantum coherence, although further analysis and confirmation will require additional theoretical calculations that take into account the complexity and inhomogeneity of individual IDTBT single molecular chains. Our results demonstrate the feasibility and promise of frequency- and time-resolved SMFg2-QLS to provide new insights into molecular quantum dynamics and to reveal signatures of intrinsic quantum coherence in photosynthetic light harvesting that are independent of the nature of the light excitation.

Title: Rocket-like dynamics of ferrimagnetic domain walls in graded materials
Authors: P. Diona, S. Artyukhin, L. Maranzana
Abstract: Domain wall motion underpins emerging spintronic technologies, such as high-speed racetrack devices and THz logic, and accelerating walls quickly is a key challenge on the path to faster devices. Recent experimental advances introduced magnetic materials with non-uniform composition, allowing angular momentum compensation points and fast domain wall motion, although acceleration of domain walls in these materials remains poorly understood. Here, we show that spatial variation of exchange and anisotropy not only pushes the wall towards lower wall surface tension region, but also modifies its inertial mass, giving rise to a variable-mass relativistic dynamics. We find another force, originating from the magnon velocity gradient, that dominates as the wall velocity approaches the magnon speed. Our results identify domain walls in nonuniform magnets as a playground for relativistic physics with variable mass and limiting this http URL://info.arxiv.org/help/prep#comments

Title: Electrical conductivity of a random nanowire network: comparison of two-dimensional and quasi-three-dimensional models
Authors: Yuri Yu. Tarasevich, Andrei V. Eserkepov
Abstract: Although the two-dimensional model of random networks of metallic nanowires or carbon nanotubes is widely used, it significantly overestimates the number of contacts between elements compared to quasi-three-dimensional models. This, within the mean-field approximation, leads to overestimates of the electrical conductivity, especially when the main contribution to the system's electrical conductivity comes from the contact resistances between the conductors. In the two-dimensional model, the system's electrical conductivity depends quadratically on the conductor density, whereas in the three-dimensional model, this dependence is linear. We propose a simple modification of a two-dimensional model, which can capture the saturation effect of the number of contacts per conductor in a real nanowire network.

Title: Hierarchical Lorentz Mirror Model: Normal Transport and a Universal $2/3$ Mean--Variance Law
Authors: Raphael Lefevere, Hal Tasaki
Abstract: The Lorentz mirror model provides a clean setting to study macroscopic transport generated solely by quenched environmental randomness. We introduce a hierarchical version whose distribution of left--right crossings satisfies an exact recursion. In dimensions $d\geq 3$, we prove normal transport: the mean conductance scales as (cross-section)/(length) on all length scales. A Gaussian closure, supported by numerics, predicts that the variance-to-mean ratio of the conductance converges to the universal value $2/3$ for all $d\geq 2$ (the ``$2/3$ law''). We provide numerical evidence for the $2/3$ law in the original (non-hierarchical) Lorentz mirror model in $d=3$, and conjecture that it is a universal signature of normal transport induced by random current matching. In the marginal case $d=2$, our hierarchical recursion reproduces the known scaling of the mean conductance and its variance.

Title: Topology optimization of type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces based on Ginzburg-Landau theory under Weyl gauge
Authors: Yongbo Deng, Jan G. Korvink
Abstract: Geometrical design is a crucial and challenging strategy for improving the performance of type-II superconductors, because the proper placement of intended defects in the current path contribute to flux pinning, a reduction in dissipation, and an increase in achievable current density. Topology optimization is currently one of the most powerful approaches used to determine consistent structural geometries. Therefore, a topology optimization approach is presented to inversely design structural geometries of low- and high-temperature type-II superconductors with superconductor-dielectric/vacuum interfaces. In the presented approach, the magnetic response of type-II superconductors is modeled using the Ginzburg-Landau theory, where the temporal evolution of the order parameter and vector potential is described by the time-dependent Ginzburg-Landau equations under the Weyl gauge.

Title: From Classical to Quantum: Extending Prometheus for Unsupervised Discovery of Phase Transitions in Three Dimensions and Quantum Systems
Authors: Brandon Yee, Wilson Collins, Maximilian Rutkowski
Abstract: We extend the Prometheus framework for unsupervised phase transition discovery from 2D classical systems to 3D classical and quantum many-body systems, addressing scalability in higher dimensions and generalization to quantum fluctuations. For the 3D Ising model ($L \leq 32$), the framework detects the critical temperature within 0.01\% of literature values ($T_c/J = 4.511 \pm 0.005$) and extracts critical exponents with $\geq 70\%$ accuracy ($\beta = 0.328 \pm 0.015$, $\gamma = 1.24 \pm 0.06$, $\nu = 0.632 \pm 0.025$), correctly identifying the 3D Ising universality class via $\chi^2$ comparison ($p = 0.72$) without analytical guidance. For quantum systems, we developed quantum-aware VAE (Q-VAE) architectures using complex-valued wavefunctions and fidelity-based loss. Applied to the transverse field Ising model, we achieve 2\% accuracy in quantum critical point detection ($h_c/J = 1.00 \pm 0.02$) and successfully discover ground state magnetization as the order parameter ($r = 0.97$). Notably, for the disordered transverse field Ising model, we detect exotic infinite-randomness criticality characterized by activated dynamical scaling $\ln \xi \sim |h - h_c|^{-\psi}$, extracting a tunneling exponent $\psi = 0.48 \pm 0.08$ consistent with theoretical predictions ($\psi = 0.5$). This demonstrates that unsupervised learning can identify qualitatively different types of critical behavior, not just locate critical points. Our systematic validation across classical thermal transitions ($T = 0$ to $T > 0$) and quantum phase transitions ($T = 0$, varying $h$) establishes that VAE-based discovery generalizes across fundamentally different physical domains, providing robust tools for exploring phase diagrams where analytical solutions are unavailable.

Title: Monte Carlo study of the classical antiferromagnetic $J_1$-$J_2$-$J_3$ Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice
Authors: A.N. Ignatenko, S.V. Streltsov, V.Yu. Irkhin
Abstract: An extensive Monte Carlo study of the classical Heisenberg model on a simple cubic lattice with antiferromagnetic exchange interactions $J_n$ between the first, second, and third neighbors is performed in a broad region of $J_2 / J_1$, $J_3 / J_1$ ratios, and temperature. The character of the phase transitions is analyzed via the Binder cumulant method. The Neel temperature $T_{\mathrm{N}}$ and the frustration parameter (the ratio $f= |\theta|/T_{\mathrm{N}}$, $\theta$ being the Curie-Weiss temperature) are calculated. A comparison with the Tyablikov approximation is carried out. The strength of the frustration effects is explored. Possible applications to antiferromagnetic perovskites, such as CaMnO$_3$ and HgMnO$_3$, are discussed.

Title: The Interplay Between Liquid-Liquid Phase Equilibria, Sequence, and Tg in Copolymers
Authors: Makayla R. Branham-Ferrari, David S. Simmons
Abstract: Copolymerization is commonly employed to tune polymers' glass formation and improve properties such as ion conductivity and adhesion. Classically, mixing rules such as the Fox equation are employed to explain glass transition temperature (Tg) variations with copolymer composition. However, many copolymers deviate from these mixing rules in a manner that is monomer-sequence sensitive. We perform molecular dynamics simulations to probe the interplay between copolymer sequence, liquid-liquid phase equilibria, and Tg. We find that the direction and sequence-dependence of Tg shift are predicted by the liquid-liquid phase behavior of the comonomers. Systems tending towards Upper Critical Solution Temperature behavior negative Tg deviations, while systems tending towards Lower Critical Solution Temperature behavior exhibit positive Tg deviations. In both cases, this effect is strengthened with increasing alternation - a consequence of bond-induced forced mixing. These results inform strategies for rationally varying copolymer Tg, at fixed composition, via design of polymer chain sequence.

Title: Nearly twofold overestimation of the superconducting volume fraction in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates
Authors: Aleksandr V. Korolev, Evgeny F. Talantsev
Abstract: The detection of the DC diamagnetic state in pressurized Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates remained an unsolved experimental problem until recent experiments in which Zhu et al.$^1$ measured the DC diamagnetic responses in zero-field cooled (ZFC) mode in pressurized La4Ni3O10. Zhu et al.$^1$ reported that the ratio of the measured ZFC magnetic moment to the Meissner magnetic moment of the sample (and this ratio was termed the superconducting volume fraction$f$) reaches 81-86%. We regard outstanding experimental results$^1$; however, our calculations based on the reported experimental datasets$^1$ using the standard procedure showed the ratio to be 51-59%. Upon our request, Zhu et al.$^1$ provided detailed explanations and the equation they used to calculate$f$. To our knowledge, the procedure$^1$ and equation$^1$ for calculating $f$ have never been mentioned or described before, including in Ref.$^1$. Here we argue that the proposed equation$^1$ and procedure$^1$ are incorrect, and that this equation$^1$ results in multiple overestimations of the superconducting volume fraction in the sample. This overestimation error affects all superconducting volume fractions $f$ in Ruddlesden-Popper nickelates reported to date$^{1-4}$. Therefore, we describe the error we discovered in this paper.

Title: Topological Dislocation Response in Elementary Semiconductors
Authors: Yuteng Zhou, Alexandre Chaduteau, Frank Schindler
Abstract: We study elementary semiconductors and insulators that are symmetric under spatial inversion: silicon, diamond, germanium, and black phosphorene. These materials are ideal candidates for realizing obstructed atomic insulators, which differ from trivial atomic insulators by a quantized spatial shift of their electronic Wannier centers with respect to the atomic lattice. We use symmetry indicator invariants that allow the prediction of non-trivial responses to crystal dislocations in these materials. We find that edge dislocations generically exhibit a non-trivial response, while screw dislocations always display a trivial response. With the aid of numerical simulations of realistic tight-binding models, we confirm the presence of mid-gap polarization bands localized along dislocations in silicon, diamond, and germanium.

Title: Quantum feedback control with a transformer neural network architecture
Authors: Pranav Vaidhyanathan, Florian Marquardt, Mark T. Mitchison, Natalia Ares
Abstract: Attention-based neural networks such as transformers have revolutionized various fields such as natural language processing, genomics, and vision. Here, we demonstrate the use of transformers for quantum feedback control through both a supervised and reinforcement learning approach. In particular, due to the transformer's ability to capture long-range temporal correlations and training efficiency, we show that it can surpass some of the limitations of previous control approaches, e.g.~those based on recurrent neural networks trained using a similar approach or policy based reinforcement learning. We numerically show, for the example of state stabilization of a two-level system, that our bespoke transformer architecture can achieve near unit fidelity to a target state in a short time even in the presence of inefficient measurement and Hamiltonian perturbations that were not included in the training set as well as the control of non-Markovian systems. We also demonstrate that our transformer can perform energy minimization of non-integrable many-body quantum systems when trained for reinforcement learning tasks. Our approach can be used for quantum error correction, fast control of quantum states in the presence of colored noise, as well as real-time tuning, and characterization of quantum devices.

Title: Nonequilibrium plasmon liquid in a Josephson junction chain
Authors: Anton V. Bubis, Lucia Vigliotti, Maksym Serbyn, Andrew P. Higginbotham
Abstract: Equilibrium quantum systems are often described by a gas of weakly-interacting normal modes. Bringing such systems far from equilibrium, however, can drastically enhance mode-to-mode interactions. Understanding the resulting liquid is a fundamental question for quantum statistical mechanics, and a practical question for engineering driven quantum devices. To tackle this question, we probe the nonequilibrium kinetics of one-dimensional plasmons in a long chain of Josephson junctions. We introduce multimode spectroscopy to controllably study the departure from equilibrium, witnessing the evolution from pairwise coupling between plasma modes at weak driving to dramatic, high-order, cascaded couplings at strong driving. Scaling to many-mode drives, we stimulate interactions between hundreds of modes, resulting in near-continuum internal dynamics. Imaging the resulting nonequilibrium plasmon populations, we then resolve the non-local redistribution of energy in the response to a weak perturbation -- an explicit verification of the emergence of a strongly interacting, non-equilibrium liquid of plasmons.

Title: Impact of Clifford operations on non-stabilizing power and quantum chaos
Authors: Naga Dileep Varikuti, Soumik Bandyopadhyay, Philipp Hauke
Abstract: Non-stabilizerness, alongside entanglement, is a crucial ingredient for fault-tolerant quantum computation and achieving a genuine quantum advantage. Despite recent progress, a complete understanding of the generation and thermalization of non-stabilizerness in circuits that mix Clifford and non-Clifford operations remains elusive. While Clifford operations do not generate non-stabilizerness, their interplay with non-Clifford gates can strongly impact the overall non-stabilizing dynamics of generic quantum circuits. In this work, we establish a direct relationship between the final non-stabilizing power and the individual powers of the non-Clifford gates, in circuits where these gates are interspersed with random Clifford operations. By leveraging this result, we unveil the thermalization of non-stabilizing power to its Haar-averaged value in generic circuits. As a precursor, we analyze two-qubit gates and illustrate this thermalization in analytically tractable systems. Extending this, we explore the operator-space non-stabilizing power and demonstrate its behavior in physical models. Finally, we examine the role of non-stabilizing power in the emergence of quantum chaos in brick-wall quantum circuits. Our work elucidates how non-stabilizing dynamics evolve and thermalize in quantum circuits and thus contributes to a better understanding of quantum computational resources and of their role in quantum chaos.

Title: Hyperbolic recurrent neural network as the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state ansatz
Authors: H. L. Dao
Abstract: In this work, we introduce the first type of non-Euclidean neural quantum state (NQS) ansatz, in the form of the hyperbolic GRU (a variant of recurrent neural networks (RNNs)), to be used in the Variational Monte Carlo method of approximating the ground state energy for quantum many-body systems. In particular, we examine the performances of NQS ansatzes constructed from both conventional or Euclidean RNN/GRU and from hyperbolic GRU in the prototypical settings of the one- and two-dimensional transverse field Ising models (TFIM) and the one-dimensional Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ and $J_1J_2J_3$ systems. By virtue of the fact that, for all of the experiments performed in this work, hyperbolic GRU can yield performances comparable to or better than Euclidean RNNs, which have been extensively studied in these settings in the literature, our work is a proof-of-concept for the viability of hyperbolic GRU as the first type of non-Euclidean NQS ansatz for quantum many-body systems. Furthermore, in settings where the Hamiltonian displays a clear hierarchical interaction structure, such as the 1D Heisenberg $J_1J_2$ & $J_1J_2J_3$ systems with the 1st, 2nd and even 3rd nearest neighbor interactions, our results show that hyperbolic GRU definitively outperforms its Euclidean version in almost all instances. The fact that these results are reminiscent of the established ones from natural language processing where hyperbolic GRU almost always outperforms Euclidean RNNs when the training data exhibit a tree-like or hierarchical structure leads us to hypothesize that hyperbolic GRU NQS ansatz would likely outperform Euclidean RNN/GRU NQS ansatz in quantum spin systems that involve different degrees of nearest neighbor interactions. Finally, with this work, we hope to initiate future studies of other types of non-Euclidean NQS beyond hyperbolic GRU.

Title: Universality of stochastic control of quantum chaos with measurement and feedback
Authors: Andrew A. Allocca, Devesh K. Verma, Sriram Ganeshan, Justin H. Wilson
Abstract: We investigate universal features of measurement-and-feedback control of quantum chaotic dynamics by examining the quantum Arnold cat map, a paradigmatic model of quantum chaos. Inspired by probabilistic control of classical chaos, our protocol stochastically alternates between intrinsic instability and engineered control operations that steer trajectories toward a target point. Simulation of exact quantum dynamics and a semiclassical truncated Wigner approximation reveal universal properties of the cat map's control transition. To further characterize this universality, we introduce the inverted harmonic oscillator as an analytically tractable effective model of instability. By integrating numerical simulations, a semiclassical Fokker-Planck description, and a direct spectral analysis of the stochastic quantum channel, we identify quantum signatures absent in classical limits. The close agreement between quantum simulation, truncated Wigner approximation, and inverted oscillator analysis shows that universal features of the transition are set by uncertainty-limited quantum fluctuations and are insensitive to genuine quantum interference.

Title: Mitigating the sign problem by quantum computing
Authors: Kwai-Kong Ng, Min-Fong Yang
Abstract: The notorious sign problem severely limits the applicability of quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations, as statistical errors grow exponentially with system size and inverse temperature. A recent proposal of a quantum-computing stochastic series expansion (qc-SSE) method suggested that the problem could be avoided by introducing constant energy shifts into the Hamiltonian. Here we critically examine this framework and show that it does not strictly resolve the sign problem for Hamiltonians with non-commuting terms. Instead, it provides a practical mitigation strategy that suppresses the occurrence of negative weights. Using the antiferromagnetic anisotropic XY chain as a test case, we analyze the dependence of the average sign on system size, temperature, anisotropy, and shift parameters. An operator contraction method is introduced to improve efficiency. Our results demonstrate that moderate shifts optimally balance sign mitigation and statistical accuracy, while large shifts amplify errors, leaving the sign problem unresolved but alleviated.

Title: Utility-Scale Quantum State Preparation: Classical Training using Pauli Path Simulation
Authors: Cheng-Ju Lin, Hrant Gharibyan, Vincent P. Su
Abstract: We use Pauli Path simulation to variationally obtain parametrized circuits for preparing ground states of various quantum many-body Hamiltonians. These include the quantum Ising model in one dimension, in two dimensions on square and heavy-hex lattices, and the Kitaev honeycomb model, all at system sizes of one hundred qubits or more -- sizes at which generic quantum circuits are beyond the reach of exact state-vector simulation -- thereby reaching utility scale. We benchmark the Pauli Path simulation results against exact ground-state energies when available, and against density-matrix renormalization group calculations otherwise, finding strong agreement. To further assess the quality of the variational states, we evaluate the magnetization in the x and z directions for the quantum Ising models and compute the topological entanglement entropy for the Kitaev honeycomb model. Finally, we prepare approximate ground states of the Kitaev honeycomb model with 48 qubits, in both the gapped and gapless regimes, on Quantinuum's System Model H2 quantum computer using parametrized circuits obtained from Pauli Path simulation. We achieve a relative energy error of approximately $5\%$ without error mitigation and demonstrate the braiding of Abelian anyons on the quantum device beyond fixed-point models.

Title: Quantum dynamics of large spins in static and rotating magnetic fields: Entanglement resonances and kinks
Authors: Nargis Sultana, Siddharth Seetharaman, Rejish Nath
Abstract: We examine the quantum dynamics of both a single large spin and a pair of spins in the presence of static and rotating magnetic fields, which can be important for qudit-based quantum technologies. Notably, we find resonant, periodic oscillations between two maximally stretched states, irrespective of how large the spin is. Additionally, we observe periodic transitions between sublevels with magnetic quantum numbers of opposite signs. The dynamics also exhibit a periodic transfer of the spin to the maximally stretched state, starting from the ground state of the initial Hamiltonian. For a pair of spins, we derive various resonance conditions and further analyze the entanglement generated by dipole-dipole interactions. In the case of two spin-1/2 particles, the entanglement dynamics reveal resonances and kinks in the maximum entanglement, and their criteria can be obtained from the energy spectrum. Strikingly, we show that the kink can be exploited to engineer the entanglement dynamics. Finally, we briefly discuss the regime of weak dipolar interactions, which are relevant for dipolar Bose-Einstein condensates.

Title: Non-abelian Geometric Quantum Energy Pump
Authors: Yang Peng
Abstract: We introduce a non-abelian geometric quantum energy pump realized by a transitionless geometric quantum drive--a time-dependent Hamiltonian supplemented by a counterdiabatic term generated by a prescribed trajectory on a smooth control manifold--that coherently transports states within a degenerate subspace. When the coordinates of the trajectory are independently addressable by external drives, the net energy transferred between drives is set by the non-abelian Berry-curvature tensor. The trajectory-averaged pumping power is separately controlled by the initial state and by the Hamiltonian topology through the Euler class. We outline an implementation with artificial atoms, which are realizable on various platforms including trapped atoms/ions, superconducting circuits, and semiconductor quantum dots. The resulting energy pump can serve as a quantum transducer or charger, and as a metrological tool for measuring phase coherences in quantum states.

Title: Higher-form entanglement asymmetry. Part I. The limits of symmetry breaking
Authors: Francesco Benini, Eduardo García-Valdecasas, Stathis Vitouladitis
Abstract: Entanglement asymmetry is a relative entropy that faithfully diagnoses symmetry breaking in quantum states, possibly within a spatial subregion. In this work, we extend such framework to higher-form symmetries and compute entanglement asymmetry in theories with spontaneously-broken continuous zero- and higher-form symmetries. One of our central results is an entropic Coleman-Mermin-Wagner theorem, for 0- and $p$-form symmetries, valid also on subregions, which forbids spontaneous breaking of continuous $p$-form symmetries in spacetime dimensions $d\leq p+2$. Our theorem not only qualifies symmetry breaking, it also quantifies it: spontaneous breaking triggers a nonvanishing entanglement asymmetry that grows monotonically towards the infrared, and counts the number of Goldstone fields. Along the way, we derive standalone results concerning the entanglement entropy and asymmetry of Goldstone bosons and gauge fields. In particular, we find a closed-form expression for the Rényi asymmetries of a compact scalar field on spherical subregions in three and four spacetime dimensions, and for higher-form gauge fields in higher dimensions.

Title: Non-reciprocal Binary-fluid Turbulence
Authors: Biswajit Maji, Nadia Bihari Padhan, Axel Voigt, Rahul Pandit
Abstract: Although effective non-reciprocal interactions have been investigated in a variety of fields, their consequences have not been explored in hydrodynamical turbulence. We initiate such an exploration by introducing non-reciprocal binary-fluid tubulence and uncover its properties by developing a two-dimensional (2D) Non-Reciprocal Cahn-Hilliard-Navier-Stokes (NRCHNS) model. We show that, as we increase the strength of the non-reciprocal terms, this model displays a hitherto unanticipated type of turbulence, with an inverse cascade of energy and an energy spectrum $E(k)\sim k^{-5/3}$, reminiscent of the well-known inverse cascade in forced, 2D fluid turbulence, but distinct from it, in so far as it develops a non-reciprocal flux $\mathbf J$. We demonstrate how NRCHNS turbulence suppresses $J(t) = |\mathbf J|$, as the Reynolds number increases. We compare and contrast 2D NRCHNS turbulence with its fluid-turbulence counterpart by examining spectra, fluxes, spectral balances, flow topologies, and signatures of multifractality.

Title: Ergotropic Mpemba crossings in finite-dimensional quantum batteries
Authors: Triyas Sapui, Tanoy Kanti Konar, Aditi Sen De
Abstract: The quantum Mpemba effect is a counterintuitive phenomenon in which a state initially farther from equilibrium relaxes more rapidly than one that starts nearer to equilibrium. In the context of finite-dimensional quantum batteries interacting with an environment, we introduce the notion of an ergotropic Mpemba crossing (EMC), defined by the intersection of ergotropy trajectories during the dynamics. For qubit batteries subjected to amplitude damping noise, we derive a condition for the occurrence of EMC in terms of the relative coherence of the initial states and fully characterize the region of state space that exhibits EMC with respect to a fixed reference state. Interestingly, our analysis reveals that under anisotropic Pauli noise, the emergence of EMC is jointly governed by the coherence and the energy of the initial states. To elucidate the physical origin of EMC, we decompose ergotropy into coherent and incoherent contributions and show that, in qubit systems, the coherent component plays a crucial role for EMC, an observation that strikingly does not extend to three-level batteries. Further, by extending our analysis to non-Markovian environments, we demonstrate that, unlike the Markovian case, non-Markovian dynamics can give rise to multiple Mpemba crossings, with the total number of crossings always being odd. Moreover, analyzing the connection between the EMC and the conventional state Mpemba effect reveals that, for qubits, an EMC necessarily entails a state Mpemba crossing while this correspondence breaks down for qutrits, where EMCs may arise without any state Mpemba crossing.

Title: Shortcuts to Adiabaticity via Adaptive Quantum Zeno Measurements
Authors: Adolfo del Campo
Abstract: We consider the quantum Zeno dynamics arising from monitoring a time-dependent projector. Starting from a stroboscopic measurement protocol, it is shown that the effective Hamiltonian for Zeno dynamics involves a nonadiabatic geometric connection that takes the form of the Kato-Avron Hamiltonian for parallel transport, stirring the evolution within the time-dependent Zeno subspace. The latter reduces to counterdiabatic driving when projective measurements are performed in the instantaneous energy eigenbasis of the quantum system. The effective Zeno Hamiltonian can also be derived in the context of continuous quantum measurements of a time-dependent observable and the non-Hermitian evolution with a complex absorbing potential varying in time. Our results thus provide a unified framework for realizing shortcuts to adiabaticity via adaptive quantum Zeno measurements.
