Title: Stochastic Thermodynamics of Non-reciprocally Interacting Particles and Fields
Authors: Atul Tanaji Mohite, Heiko Rieger
Abstract: Nonreciprocal interactions that violate Newton's law 'actio=reactio' are ubiquitous in nature and are currently intensively investigated in active matter, chemical reaction networks, population dynamics, and many other fields. An outstanding challenge is the thermodynamically consistent formulation of the underlying stochastic dynamics that obeys local detailed balance and allows for a rigorous analysis of the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting particles. Here, we present such a framework for a broad class of active systems and derive by systematic coarse-graining exact expressions for the macroscopic entropy production. Four independent contributions to the thermodynamic dissipation can be identified, among which the energy flux sustaining vorticity currents manifests the presence of non-reciprocal interactions. Then, Onsager's non-reciprocal relations, the fluctuation-response relation, the fluctuation relation and the thermodynamic uncertainty relations for non-reciprocal systems are derived. Finally, we demonstrate that our general framework is applicable to a plethora of active matter systems and chemical reaction networks and opens new paths to understand the stochastic thermodynamics of non-reciprocally interacting many-body systems.

Title: Cat states carrying long-range correlations in the many-body localized phase
Authors: Nicolas Laflorencie, Jeanne Colbois, Fabien Alet
Abstract: Despite considerable efforts over the last decade, the high-energy phase diagram of the random-field Heisenberg chain still eludes our understanding, in particular the nature of the non-ergodic many-body localized (MBL) regime expected at strong disorder. In this work, we revisit this paradigmatic model by studying the statistics of rare atypical events of strongly correlated spin pairs traversing the entire system. They occur for unexpectedly strong disorder, i.e., in a regime where standard estimates fail to detect any instability. We then identify these very peculiar high-energy eigenstates, which exhibit system-wide ${\cal{O}}(1)$ correlations, as nearly degenerate pairs of resonant cat states of the form $|{\Phi}_{\pm}\rangle\sim {|{\alpha_1}\rangle}\pm {|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$, where ${|{\alpha_1}\rangle}$ and ${|{\alpha_2}\rangle}$ are spin basis states. We propose a simple and generic analytical description of this new class of eigenstates that exhibit system-spanning entanglement. This analytical ansatz guides us in our search for rare hidden cat states in exponentially large many-body spectra. This also enables a systematic numerical inspection of the microscopic anatomy of these unconventional pairs, which appear in a wide range of disorder strengths. In the light of recent studies and ongoing debates on the MBL problem, our results offer new perspectives and stimulating challenges to this very active field.

Title: Non-Hermitian Multipole Skin Effects Challenge Localization
Authors: Jacopo Gliozzi, Federico Balducci, Taylor L. Hughes, Giuseppe De Tomasi
Abstract: We study the effect of quenched disorder on the non-Hermitian skin effect in systems that conserve a U(1) charge and its associated multipole moments. In particular, we generalize the Hatano-Nelson argument for an Anderson transition in a disordered system with non-reciprocal hopping to the interacting case. When only U(1) charge is conserved, we show that there is a transition between a skin effect phase, in which charges are localized at a boundary, and a many-body localized phase, in which the charges are localized at random positions. In periodic boundary conditions, the skin effect gives way to a delocalized phase with a unidirectional current. If additional multipole moments like dipoles are conserved, we show that the non-Hermitian skin effect remains stable for any amount of disorder. As a result, under periodic boundary conditions, the system is always delocalized regardless of disorder strength.

Title: Magnetically modified double slit based x-ray interferometry
Authors: S. Atkar, Z. Tumbleson, S. A. Morley, N. Burdet, A. Islegen-Wojdyla, K. A. Goldberg, A. Scholl, S. A. Montoya, Trinanjan Datta, S. Roy
Abstract: We demonstrate an experimental approach to determine magneto-optical effects which combines x-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) with x-ray interferometry, based on the concepts of Young's canonical double slit. By covering one of two slits with a magnetic thin film and employing XMCD, we show that it is possible to determine both the real and the imaginary parts of the complex refractive index by measuring the fringe shifts that occur due to a change in the sample magnetization. Our hybrid spectroscopic-interferometric methodology provides a means to probe changes in the magnetic refractive index in terms of the electron spin moment.

Title: Development of microwave surface elastoresistivity measurement technique under tunable strain
Authors: Suguru Hosoi, Kohei Matsuura, Masaaki Shimozawa, Koichi Izawa, Shigeru Kasahara, Takasada Shibauchi
Abstract: By integrating a dielectric microwave resonator with a piezoelectric-based strain device, we develop an in situ strain-tunable microwave spectroscopy technique that enables contactless measurements of superconducting properties under strain. In the slightly overdoped iron-based superconductor BaFe$_2$(As$_{1-x}$P$_x$)$_2$, we successfully observe a systematic strain dependence of the superconducting transition, manifested as changes in the quality factor and resonance frequency shifts. Both compressive and tensile anisotropic lattice distortions along the [110]${_{\rm T}}$ direction suppress superconductivity, consistent with standard transport measurements, highlighting the pivotal role of nematic fluctuations in the superconducting mechanism. Our strain-tunable cavity therefore serves as a powerful, contactless probe of fundamental superconducting material properties under strain and may also potentially facilitate the design of hybrid quantum systems with strain-controlled quantum degrees of freedom.

Title: MatterTune: An Integrated, User-Friendly Platform for Fine-Tuning Atomistic Foundation Models to Accelerate Materials Simulation and Discovery
Authors: Lingyu Kong, Nima Shoghi, Guoxiang Hu, Pan Li, Victor Fung
Abstract: Geometric machine learning models such as graph neural networks have achieved remarkable success in recent years in chemical and materials science research for applications such as high-throughput virtual screening and atomistic simulations. The success of these models can be attributed to their ability to effectively learn latent representations of atomic structures directly from the training data. Conversely, this also results in high data requirements for these models, hindering their application to problems which are data sparse which are common in this domain. To address this limitation, there is a growing development in the area of pre-trained machine learning models which have learned general, fundamental, geometric relationships in atomistic data, and which can then be fine-tuned to much smaller application-specific datasets. In particular, models which are pre-trained on diverse, large-scale atomistic datasets have shown impressive generalizability and flexibility to downstream applications, and are increasingly referred to as atomistic foundation models. To leverage the untapped potential of these foundation models, we introduce MatterTune, a modular and extensible framework that provides advanced fine-tuning capabilities and seamless integration of atomistic foundation models into downstream materials informatics and simulation workflows, thereby lowering the barriers to adoption and facilitating diverse applications in materials science. In its current state, MatterTune supports a number of state-of-the-art foundation models such as ORB, MatterSim, JMP, and EquformerV2, and hosts a wide range of features including a modular and flexible design, distributed and customizable fine-tuning, broad support for downstream informatics tasks, and more.

Title: Out-of-equilibrium dynamics across the first-order quantum transitions of one-dimensional quantum Ising models
Authors: Andrea Pelissetto, Davide Rossini, Ettore Vicari
Abstract: We study the out-of-equilibrium dynamics of one-dimensional quantum Ising models in a transverse field $g$, driven by a time-dependent longitudinal field $h$ across their {\em magnetic} first-order quantum transition at $h=0$, for sufficiently small values of $|g|$. We consider nearest-neighbor Ising chains of size $L$ with periodic boundary conditions. We focus on the out-of-equilibrium behavior arising from Kibble-Zurek protocols, in which $h$ is varied linearly in time with time scale $t_s$, i.e., $h(t)=t/t_s$. The system starts from the ground state at $h_i\equiv h(t_i)<0$, where the longitudinal magnetization $M$ is negative. Then it evolves unitarily up to positive values of $h(t)$, where $M(t)$ becomes eventually positive. We identify several scaling regimes characterized by a nontrivial interplay between the size $L$ and the time scale $t_s$, which can be observed when the system is close to one of the many avoided level crossings that occur for $h\ge 0$. In the $L\to\infty$ limit, all these crossings approach $h=0^+$, making the study of the thermodynamic limit, defined as the limit $L\to\infty$ keeping $t$ and $t_s$ constant, problematic. We study such limit numerically, by first determining the large-$L$ quantum evolution at fixed $t_s$, and then analyzing its behavior with increasing $t_s$. Our analysis shows that the system switches from the initial state with $M<0$ to a positively magnetized state at $h = h_*(t_s)>0$, where $h_*(t_s)$ decreases with increasing $t_s$, apparently as $h_*\sim 1/\ln t_s$. This suggests the existence of a scaling behavior in terms of the rescaled time $\Omega = t \ln t_s/t_s$. The numerical results also show that the system converges to a nontrivial stationary state in the large-$t$ limit, characterized by an energy significantly larger than that of the corresponding homogeneously magnetized ground state.

Title: Grain Boundary Space Charge Engineering of Solid Oxide Electrolytes: Model Thin Film Study
Authors: Thomas Defferriere, Yong Beom Kim, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau, WooChul Jung, Harry L. Tuller
Abstract: Grain boundaries (GB) profoundly influence the electrical properties of polycrystalline ionic solids. Yet, precise control of their transport characteristics has remained elusive, thereby limiting the performance of solid-state electrochemical devices. Here, we demonstrate unprecedented manipulation of space charge controlled ionic grain boundary resistance (up to 12 orders of magnitude) in metal oxide thin films. We exploit the orders of magnitude higher grain boundary diffusivities of substrate cation elements (i.e. Al from $Al_2O_3$ and Mg from MgO) relative to the bulk to modify the grain boundary chemistry, and thereby GB core charge, in a model oxygen ion conducting polycrystalline thin film solid electrolyte, Gd-doped $CeO_2$. This approach, confirmed jointly by TEM imaging and by extracting the respective GB and bulk diffusivities from measured SIMS profiles, enabled us to selectively control the chemistry of the GBs, while minimally modifying grain (bulk) chemistry or film microstructure, thereby ruling out potential effects of microstructure, strain or secondary phases. Broad tuning of GB space charge potentials is achieved by manipulating GB core charge density by over an order of magnitude, thereby providing a powerful tool for systematic studies of grain boundary phenomena across various functional materials. The implications of such control are far-reaching in achieving new functionality, improving efficiency and longevity of solid-state electrochemical devices.

Title: Biomechanics of orientationally ordered epithelial tissue
Authors: Patrick W. Alford, Luiza Angheluta, Jorge Vinals
Abstract: Organogenesis involves large deformations and complex shape changes that require elaborate mechanical regulation. Models of tissue biomechanics have been introduced to account for the coupling between mechanical response and biochemical processes. Recent experimental evidence indicates that the mechanical response of epithelial tissue is strongly anisotropic, with the degree of anisotropy being correlated with the existence of long range orientational order of cytoskeletal organization across the tissue. A theoretical framework is introduced that captures the dynamic feedback between tissue elastic response and cytoskeletal reorganization under stress. Within the linear regime for small and uniform applied strains, the shear modulus is effectively reduced by the nematic order in cytoskeletal alignment induced by the applied strain. This prediction agrees with experimental observations of epithelial response in lithographically patterned micro tissues.

Title: Shuttling Majorana zero modes in disordered and noisy topological superconductors
Authors: Bill P. Truong, Kartiek Agarwal, T. Pereg-Barnea
Abstract: The braiding of Majorana zero modes (MZMs) forms the fundamental building block for topological quantum computation. Braiding protocols which involve the physical exchange of MZMs are typically envisioned on a network of topological superconducting wires. An essential component of these protocols is the transport of MZMs, which can be performed by using electric gates to locally tune sections ("piano keys") of the wire between topologically trivial and non-trivial phases. In this work, we numerically simulate this piano key transport on a superconducting wire which contains either disorder (uncorrelated and correlated) or noise. We focus on the impact of these additional effects on the diabatic error, which describes unwanted transitions between the ground state and excited states. For disorder, we show that the behavior of the average diabatic error is predominantly controlled by the statistics of the minimum bulk energy gap. When the disorder is spatially correlated, we demonstrate that this leads to an increase in the diabatic error due to a further suppression of the minimum bulk energy gap and highlight the scaling of this suppression with the piano key size. For noise, we illustrate that the diabatic error is significantly enhanced due to optical transitions which depend on the minimum bulk energy gap as well as the frequency modes present in the noise. The results presented here serve to further characterize the diabatic error in disordered and noisy settings, which are important considerations in practical implementations of physical braiding schemes.

Title: Adaptive Synaptogenesis Implemented on a Nanomagnetic Platform
Authors: Faiyaz Elahi Mullick, Supriyo Bandyopadhyay, Rob Baxter, Tony J. Ragucci, Avik W. Ghosh
Abstract: The human brain functions very differently from artificial neural networks (ANN) and possesses unique features that are absent in ANN. An important one among them is "adaptive synaptogenesis" that modifies synaptic weights when needed to avoid catastrophic forgetting and promote lifelong learning. The key aspect of this algorithm is supervised Hebbian learning, where weight modifications in the neocortex driven by temporal coincidence are further accepted or vetoed by an added control mechanism from the hippocampus during the training cycle, to make distant synaptic connections highly sparse and strategic. In this work, we discuss various algorithmic aspects of adaptive synaptogenesis tailored to edge computing, demonstrate its function using simulations, and design nanomagnetic hardware accelerators for specific functions of synaptogenesis.

Title: Ground-State-Based Model Reduction with Unitary Circuits
Authors: Shengtao Jiang, Steven R. White
Abstract: We present a method to numerically obtain low-energy effective models based on a unitary transformation of the ground state. The algorithm finds a unitary circuit that transforms the ground state of the original model to a projected wavefunction with only the low-energy degrees of freedom. The effective model can then be derived using the unitary transformation encoded in the circuit. We test our method on the one-dimensional and two-dimensional square-lattice Hubbard model at half-filling, and obtain more accurate effective spin models than the standard perturbative approach.

Title: Non-resonant two-photon x-ray absorption in Cu
Authors: J. J. Kas, J. J. Rehr, J. Stohr, J. Vinson
Abstract: We present a real-space Green's function theory and calculations of two-photon x-ray absorption (TPA). Our focus is on non-resonant K-shell TPA in metallic Cu, which has been observed experimentally at intense x-ray free electron laser (XFEL) sources. The theory is based on an independentparticle Green's function treatment of the Kramers-Heisenberg equation and an approximation for the sum over non-resonant intermediate states in terms of a static quadrupole transition operator. XFEL effects are modeled by a partially depleted d-band. This approach is shown to give results for K-shell TPA in quantitative agreement with XFEL experiment and with a Bethe-Salpeter Equation approach. We also briefly discuss many-body corrections and TPA sum-rules.

Title: Gapless Foliated-Exotic Duality
Authors: Kantaro Ohmori, Shutaro Shimamura
Abstract: In this work, we construct a new foliated quantum field theory equivalent to the exotic $\phi$-theory -- a fractonic gapless scalar field theory described by tensor gauge fields and exhibiting $U(1) \times U(1)$ subsystem global symmetry. This subsystem symmetry has an 't Hooft anomaly, which is captured by a subsystem symmetry-protected topological (SSPT) phase in one dimension higher via the anomaly inflow mechanism. By analyzing both the anomaly inflow structure and the foliated-exotic duality in the SSPT phases, we establish the foliated-exotic duality in the $\phi$-theories. Furthermore, we also investigate the foliated-exotic duality in the $\hat\phi$-theory, which is dual to the $\phi$-theory, and construct the foliated $\hat\phi$-theory. These are the first examples of the foliated-exotic duality in gapless theories.

Title: Elastocaloric signature of the excitonic instability in Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$
Authors: Elliott Rosenberg, Joss Ayres-Sims, Andrew Millis, David Cobden, Jiun-Haw Chu
Abstract: On cooling through a temperature $T_S$ of around 324 K, Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ undergoes a transition from a semimetallic state to one with a gapped electronic spectrum which is suspected to be an excitonic insulator. However, at this transition the structure also changes, from orthorhombic to monoclinic, leaving open the question of whether it is driven primarily by excitonic ordering or by a lattice instability. A lattice instability of this symmetry would correspond to softening of a B$_{2g}$ optical or acoustic phonon mode. Here, we report that elastocaloric measurements of Ta$_2$NiSe$_5$ with induced B$_{2g}$ strain reveal a thermodynamic susceptibility described by a Curie-Weiss law with a Curie temperature $T^*$ of 298 K. The fact that $T^*$ is close to $T_S$ rules out the possibility that the B$_{2g}$ acoustic mode is responsible for the transition. Since prior Raman measurements have shown minimal softening of the B$_{2g}$ optical mode as well, our finding strengthens the case that the transition is largely excitonic in nature. Our work underscores the potential of using strain as a tool for separating electronic and lattice contributions in phase transitions.

Title: XRD study of the magnetization plateau above 40 T in the frustrated helimagnet CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$
Authors: M. Gen, K. Noda, K. Shimbori, T. Tanaka, D. Bhoi, K. Seki, H. Kobayashi, K. Gautam, M. Akaki, Y. Ishii, Y. H. Matsuda, Y. Kubota, Y. Inubushi, M. Yabashi, Y. Kohama, T. Arima, A. Ikeda
Abstract: CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$, which contains a chromium breathing pyrochlore network, exhibits diverse magnetic phases, including an incommensurate helical state below 31 K and a 1/2-magnetization plateau above 40 T, owing to the interplay between magnetic frustration and spin-lattice coupling. Here, we perform a single-shot powder x-ray diffraction experiment on CuGaCr$_{4}$S$_{8}$ in a pulsed high magnetic field of 55 T, revealing an orthorhombic-to-cubic (or pseudocubic) structural transition upon entering the 1/2-magnetization plateau phase at low temperatures. This observation suggests the emergence of a commensurate ferrimagnetic order, where a 3-up-1-down spin configuration is realized in each small tetrahedron, and the all-up or all-down in each large tetrahedron. We propose two types of 16-sublattice magnetic structures, which are degenerate within exchange interactions between the first, second, and third nearest neighbors.

Title: Intertwined fluctuations and isotope effects in the Hubbard-Holstein model on the square lattice from functional renormalization
Authors: Aiman Al-Eryani, Sabine Andergassen, Michael M. Scherer
Abstract: Electron-electron and electron-phonon interactions are responsible for the formation of spin, charge, and superconducting correlations in layered quantum materials. A paradigmatic model for such materials that captures both kinds of interactions is the two-dimensional Hubbard-Holstein model with a dispersionless Einstein phonon. In this work, we provide a detailed analysis of the magnetic, density, and superconducting fluctuations at and away from half-filling. To that end, we employ the functional renormalization group using the recently introduced extension of the single-boson exchange formulation. More precisely, we go beyond previous approaches to the model by resolving the full frequency dependence of the two-particle vertex and taking into account the feedback from the electronic self-energy. We perform broad parameter scans in the space of Hubbard repulsion, electron-phonon coupling strength, and phonon frequency to explore the leading magnetic, density, and superconducting susceptibilities from the adiabatic to the anti-adiabatic regime. Our numerical data reveal that self-energy effects lead to an enhancement of the $d$-wave superconducting susceptibility towards larger phonon frequencies, in contrast to earlier isotope-effect studies. At small phonon frequencies, large density contributions to the $s$-wave superconducting susceptibility change sign and eventually lead to a reduction of $s$-wave superconductivity with increasing electron-phonon coupling, signaling the breakdown of Migdal-Eliashberg theory. We analyze our findings systematically, employing detailed diagnostics of the intertwined fluctuations and pinning down the various positive and negative isotope effects of the physical susceptibilities.

Title: Strain effect on optical properties and quantum weight of 2D magnetic topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S)
Authors: Nguyen Tuan Hung, Vuong Van Thanh, Mingda Li, Takahiro Shimada
Abstract: Manipulating the optical and quantum properties of two-dimensional (2D) materials through strain engineering is not only fundamentally interesting but also provides significant benefits across various applications. In this work, we employ first-principles calculations to investigate the effects of strain on the magnetic and optical properties of 2D topological insulators MnBi$_2$X$_4$ (X = Te, Se, S). Our results indicate that biaxial strain enhances the Mn magnetic moment, while uniaxial strains reduce it. Significantly, the strain-dependent behavior, quantified through the quantum weight, can be leveraged to control the system's quantum geometry and topological features. Particularly, uniaxial strains reduce the quantum weight and introduce anisotropy, thus providing an additional degree of freedom to tailor device functionalities. Finally, by analyzing chemical bonds under various strain directions, we elucidate how the intrinsic ductile or brittle fracture behavior of MnBi$_2$X$_4$ could impact fabrication protocols and structural stability. These insights pave the way for strain-based approaches to optimize the quantum properties in 2D magnetic topological insulators in practical device contexts.

Title: Unusual gas sensor response and semiconductor-to-insulator transition in WO3-x nanostructures : The role of oxygen vacancy
Authors: K. Ganesan, P.K. Ajikumar
Abstract: WO3-x thinfilms featuring petal-like and lamella-like nanostructures are grown under controlled oxygen partial pressures using hot filament chemical vapor deposition. These synthesized WO3-x nanostructures exhibit monoclinic structure and contain a significant amount of oxygen vacancies (VO) as confirmed by X-ray diffraction and Raman spectroscopy, respectively. These WO3-x nanostructures demonstrate sensor response to both NH3 and NO2 gases even at room temperature. However, the sensor response varies with temperature and analyte gas type. For NH3, the sensors exhibit an increase in resistance behaving like a p-type semiconductor at temperatures below 150 0C while the resistance decreases at higher temperatures, resembling n-type semiconductor behavior. On the other hand, below 150 0C, these sensors display n-type behavior towards NO2 but act like p-type semiconductor at higher temperatures. Further temperature dependent transport studies were performed in these WO3-x nanostructures in the temperature range from 25 to 300 oC, after inducing additional VO in the films through annealing under CH4. The petal-like WO3-x nanostructures display an abrupt change in resistance, indicating insulator-to-semiconductor and semiconductor-to-insulator transitions during heating and cooling cycles respectively, in the temperature range of 100 - 212 0C. In lamella-like WO3-x nanostructures, the resistance is flipped from semiconductor-to-insulator at 300 0C and remains insulating state when cooled down to 30 0C. The abnormal gas sensing behavior and insulator - semiconductor transition is discussed in terms of VO in WO3-x nanostructures.

Title: Infinite temperature spin dynamics in the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model
Authors: Ádám Bácsi, Doru Sticlet, Catalin Pascu Moca, Balázs Dóra
Abstract: We focus on the infinite temperature dynamical spin structure factor of the asymmetric Hatsugai-Kohmoto model, the relative of the asymmetric Hubbard model. It is characterized by distinct single particle energies for the two spin species, which interact with each other through a contact interaction in momentum space. We evaluate its spin structure factor exactly and follow the evolution of its excitation spectrum for all fillings and interactions, identify signatures of the Mott transition and fingerprints of the asymmetric hoppings. The longitudinal spin structure factor exhibits sound like and interaction induced gapped excitations, whose number gets doubled in the presence of hopping asymmetry. The transverse response displays the competition of interaction and asymmetry induced gaps and results in a quadratic excitation branch at their transition. The complete asymmetric case features momentum-independent dynamical structure factor, characteristic to transitions involving a flat band.

Title: Raman Fingerprints of Phase Transitions and Ferroic Couplings in Van der Waals Material CuCrP$_2$S$_6$
Authors: Jing Tang, Benjamin J Lawrie, Mouyang Cheng, Yueh-Chun Wu, Huan Zhao, Dejia Kong, Ruiqi Lu, Ching-Hsiang Yao, Zheng Gai, An-Ping Li, Mingda Li, Xi Ling
Abstract: CuCrP$_2$S$_6$ (CCPS), a type-II multiferroic material, exhibits unique phase transitions involving ferroelectric, antiferroelectric, and antiferromagnetic ordering. In this study, we conduct a comprehensive investigation on the intricate phase transitions and their multiferroic couplings in CCPS across a wide temperature range from 4 to 345 K through Raman spectroscopic measurements down to 5 cm$^{-1}$. We first assign the observed Raman modes with the support of theoretical calculations and angle-resolved polarized Raman measurements. We further present clear signatures of phase transitions from analyses of temperature-dependent Raman spectral parameters. Particularly, two low-frequency soft modes are observed at 36.1 cm$^{-1}$ and 70.5 cm$^{-1}$ below 145 K, indicating the antiferroelectric to quasi-antiferroelectric transition. Moreover, phonon modes hardening is observed when the temperature increases from 4 to 65 K, suggesting negative thermal expansion (NTE) and strong magnetoelastic coupling below 65 K. These findings advance the understanding of vdW multiferroic CCPS, paving the way for future design and engineering of multiferroicity in cutting-edge technologies, such as spintronics and quantum devices.

Title: Superconducting quantum oscillations and anomalous negative magnetoresistance in a honeycomb nanopatterned oxide interface superconductor
Authors: Yishuai Wang, Siyuan Hong, Wenze Pan, Yi Zhou, Yanwu Xie
Abstract: The extremely low superfluid density and unprecedented tunability of oxide interface superconductors provide an ideal platform for studying fluctuations in two-dimensional superconductors. In this work, we have fabricated a LaAlO3/KTaO3 interface superconductor patterned with a nanohoneycomb array of insulating islands. Little-Parks-like magnetoresistance oscillations have been observed, which are dictated by the superconducting flux quantum h/2e. Moreover, an anomalous negative magnetoresistance (ANMR) appears under a weak magnetic field, suggesting magnetic-field-enhanced superconductivity. By examining their dependences on temperature, measurement current, and electrical gating, we conclude that both phenomena are associated with superconducting order parameter: The h/2e oscillations provide direct evidence of Cooper pair transport; the ANMR is interpreted as a consequence of multiple connected narrow superconducting paths with strong fluctuations.

Title: douka: A universal platform of data assimilation for materials modeling
Authors: Aoi Watanabe, Ryuhei Sato, Ikuya Kinefuchi, Yasushi Shibuta
Abstract: A large-scale, general-purpose data assimilation (DA) platform for materials modeling, douka, was developed and applied to nonlinear materials models. The platform demonstrated its effectiveness in estimating physical properties that cannot be directly obtained from observed data. DA was successfully performed using experimental images of oxygen evolution reaction at a water electrolysis electrode, enabling the estimation of oxygen gas injection velocity and bubble contact angle. Furthermore, large-scale ensemble DA was conducted on the supercomputer Fugaku, achieving state estimation with up to 8,192 ensemble members. The results confirmed that runtime scaling for the prediction step follows the weak scaling law, ensuring computational efficiency even with increased ensemble sizes. These findings highlight the potential of douka as a new approach for data-driven materials science, integrating experimental data with numerical simulation.

Title: Symmetry-protected topological order identified via Gutzwiller-guided density-matrix-renormalization-group: $\mathrm{SO}(n)$ spin chains
Authors: Pei-Yuan Cai, Hui-Ke Jin, Yi Zhou
Abstract: We present a comprehensive study of topological phases in the SO($n$) spin chains using a combination of analytical parton construction and numerical techniques. For even $n=2l$, we identify a novel SPT$^2$ phase characterized by two distinct topological sectors, exhibiting exact degeneracy at the matrix product state (MPS) exactly solvable point. Through Gutzwiller-projected mean-field theory and density matrix renormalization group (DMRG) calculations, we demonstrate that these sectors remain topologically degenerate throughout the SPT$^2$ phase, with energy gaps decaying exponentially with system size. For odd $n=2l+1$, we show that the ground state remains unique. We precisely characterize critical states using entanglement entropy scaling, confirming the central charges predicted by conformal field theories. Our results reveal fundamental differences between even and odd $n$ cases, provide numerical verification of topological protection, and establish reliable methods for studying high-symmetry quantum systems. The Gutzwiller-guided DMRG is demonstrated to be notably efficient in targeting specific topological sectors.

Title: Induced magnetic moment at two-dimensional MXene/ferromagnetic interface evaluated by angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy
Authors: Prabhat Kumar, Shunsuke Tsuda, Koichiro Yaji, Shinji Isogami
Abstract: Emergent ferromagnetism on the surface of recent two-dimensional (2D) MXene is investigated by X-ray magnetic circular dichroism (XMCD) and angle-dependent hard X-ray photoemission spectroscopy (HAXPES). Focusing on the Cr2N as one of the 2D-MXenes, the bilayers of Cr2N/Co and Cr2N/Pt are prepared by magnetron sputtering technique. XMCD reveals the induced magnetic moment of Cr in the Cr2N/Co interface, while it is not observed in the Cr2N/Pt interface at room temperature. To distinguish the possible origins of either the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling or the charge transfer at the interfaces, the additional controlled Cr2N/Cu bilayer, whose work function of Cu is consistent with Co, is prepared. HAXPES spectra for the Cr 2p core level near the interface of Cr2N/Cu is consistent with that of Cr2N/Co, indicating that the induced magnetic moment of Cr observed by XMCD for the Cr2N/Co can be attributed to the interlayer magnetic exchange coupling, rather than the charge transfer, which is a specific characteristics emerged at the interface with 2D-MXene.

Title: Bulk Hydrodynamic Transport in Weyl Semimetals
Authors: Joan Bernabeu, Kitinan Pongsangangan, H.T.C. Stoof, Lars Fritz
Abstract: The role of collective longitudinal modes, plasmons, in bulk hydrodynamic transport in Weyl semimetals is explored. In contrast to graphene, where these modes are gapless, plasmons in Weyl semimetals are gapped. This gap, however, can be made arbitrarily small by decreasing the temperature or the chemical potential, making plasmon modes thermally accessible, both in thermodynamics and transport. In very clean Weyl semimetals near charge-neutrality where the plasmon gap is minimal, we find that they leave an imprint in the thermal conductivity and the viscosity.

Title: Phonon-polaritons in Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09): A Raman scattering study
Authors: D. Singh, A. Elmahjoubi, O. Pages, V.J.B. Torres, C. Gardiennet, G. Kervern, A. Polian, Y. Le Godec, J.-P. Itie, S. Diliberto, S. Michel, P. Franchetti, K. Strzalkowski
Abstract: Phonon-polaritons (PP) are phonon-photon coupled modes. Using near-forward Raman scattering, the PP of the cubic Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09) semiconductor alloy could be measured. While the PP-coupling hardly develops in pure ZnTe, minor Mg-alloying suffices to stabilize a long-lifetime PP strongly bound to the lattice, i.e., with a pronounced phonon character, and yet a fast one originating from the highly dispersive photon-like bottleneck of the PP-dispersion. By combining the advantages of a phonon and of a photon, the long-lifetime PP generated by minor Mg-alloying of ZnTe marks an improvement over the PP of pristine ZnTe, that, from the Raman cross section calculation, can only achieve a balanced compromise between the two kinds of advantages, intensity and speed. The discussion of the PP-related lattice dynamics of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x<0.09) is grounded in a preliminary study of the lattice macro- and microstructure using X-ray diffraction and solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance, respectively, and further relies on ab initio calculations of the native phonon modes behind the PP in the Mg-dilute limit of Zn(1-x)MgxTe (x~0), considering various Mg-isotopes.

Abstract: The planar Hall effect (PHE), previously observed in Weyl and Dirac semimetals due to the chiral anomaly, emerges with a different origin in topological insulators (TIs), where in-plane magnetic fields induce resistivity anisotropy. In strictly two-dimensional TIs, PHE is generally suppressed due to the inability of the out-of-plane Berry curvature to couple to the in-plane band velocity of the charge carriers. Here, we demonstrate that in ultrathin TI films, a quasi-two-dimensional system, intersurface tunneling coupling with in-plane magnetization induces electronic anisotropy, enabling a finite PHE. In addition, we reveal that strong in-plane magnetization can stabilize the thickness-dependent quantum anomalous Hall effect, typically associated with out-of-plane magnetization. These insights advance the understanding of magnetic topological phases, paving the way for next-generation spintronic devices and magnetic sensing technologies.

Title: Near-room-temperature zero-dimensional polariton lasers with sub-10 GHz linewidths
Authors: Ismael dePedro-Embid, Alexander S. Kuznetsov, Klaus Biermann, Andrés Cantarero, Paulo V. Santos
Abstract: Narrow and brilliant spectral lines are essential assets for high-resolution spectroscopy as well as for precision sensing and optomechanics. In semiconductor structures and, in particular, in the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system, strong emission lines with nanosecond coherence times can be provided by the opto-electronic resonances of microcavity exciton-polariton condensates. The temporal coherence of these resonances, however, normally rapidly deteriorates as the temperature increases beyond a few tens of kelvins due to exciton dissociation. Here, we demonstrate that the temperature stability of polariton condensates in (Al,Ga)As can be significantly improved by confinement within micrometer-sized intracavity traps. We show that trapped condensates can survive up to ~200 K while maintaining a light-matter character with decoherence rates below 10 GHz (i.e., $< 40 {\mu}$eV linewidths). These linewidths are by an order of magnitude smaller than those so far reported for other solid-state systems at these temperatures. Confinement thus provides a pathway towards room-temperature polariton condensation using the well-established (Al,Ga)As material system with prospects for application in scalable on-chip photonic devices for optical processing, sensing, and computing.

Title: Chiral Domain Walls Induced by Radially Magnetized Nanotube Geometry
Authors: Nobuyuki Umetsu, Hiroki Tokuhira, Michael Quinsat, Hideto Horii, Tsuyoshi Kondo, Masaki Kado
Abstract: We theoretically investigate chiral domain walls (DWs) formed in radially magnetized nanotubes with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy (PMA). Unlike tubes with an easy axis of magnetization oriented in other directions, radially magnetized tubes exhibit geometrical effects arising not only from exchange interactions but also from magnetostatic interactions, which lead to Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction (DMI)-like effects. We derive expressions for the effective magnetic fields acting on DWs within PMA nanotubes and quantify SOT-driven DW motion using an analytical one-dimensional model, which is validated by micromagnetic simulations. Our results show that the DMI-like field due to magnetostatic interactions can be as significantly as the contribution of the material-induced DMI in nanotubes with diameters below 100$\,$nm. This implies that the direction and speed of DW motion in PMA nanotubes could differ from those observed in nanoribbons composed of the same material. Furthermore, we demonstrate that DW velocity can be effectively controlled by adjusting the tube diameter and exchange stiffness constant of the magnetic layer, rather than relying solely on the material-induced DMI. These insights are expected to greatly expand the potential applications of PMA nanotube-based DW devices.

Title: Effective Theory of Ultrafast Skyrmion Nucleation
Authors: Rein Liefferink, Lukas Körber, Kathinka Gerlinger, Bastian Pfau, Felix Büttner, Johan H. Mentink
Abstract: Laser-induced ultrafast skyrmion nucleation has been experimentally demonstrated in several materials. So far, atomistic models have been used to corroborate experimental results. However, such simulations do not provide a simple intuitive understanding of the underlying physics. Here, we propose a coarse-grained effective theory where skyrmions can be nucleated or annihilated by thermal activation over energy barriers. Evaluating these two processes during a heat pulse shows good agreement with atomistic spin dynamics simulations and experiments while drastically reducing computational complexity. Furthermore, the effective theory provides a direct guide for experimentally optimizing the number of nucleated skyrmions. Interestingly, the model also predicts a novel pathway for ultrafast annihilation of skyrmions. Our results pave the way for a deeper understanding of ultrafast nanomagnetism and the role of non-equilibrium physics.

Title: Floquet realization of prethermal Meissner phase in a two-leg flux ladder
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Tapan Mishra, K. Sengupta
Abstract: We show that a periodically driven two-leg flux ladder hosting interacting hardcore bosons exhibits a prethermal Meissner phase for large drive amplitudes and at special drive frequencies. Such a prethermal Meissner phase is characterized by a finite time-averaged chiral current. We find an analytic expression of these frequencies using Floquet perturbation theory. Our analysis reveals that the presence of the prethermal Meissner phase is tied to the emergence of strong Hilbert space fragmentation in these driven ladders. We support our analytical results by numerical study of finite-size flux ladders using exact diagonalization and discuss experiments using ultracold dipolar atom platforms that may test our theory.

Title: Tunable self-emulsification via viscoelastic control of Marangoni-driven interfacial instabilities
Authors: Christoph Haessig, Mehdi Habibi, Uddalok Sen
Abstract: Interfacial instabilities in multicomponent fluidic systems are widespread in nature and in industrial processes, yet controlling their dynamics remains a challenge. Here, we present a strategy to actively tune Marangoni-driven self-emulsification at liquid-liquid interfaces by harnessing fluid viscoelasticity. When a water-alcohol droplet spreads on an oil bath, a radial surface tension gradient induced by selective alcohol evaporation drives an interfacial instability, leading to the spontaneous formation of a dense two-dimensional array of "daughter" droplets. We demonstrate that introducing trace amounts of high-molecular-weight polymers, which introduces viscoelasticity, provides a robust means of controlling this process. Increasing viscoelasticity systematically suppresses the instability, resulting in a delayed onset of fragmentation and longer spreading fingers. By combining high-resolution experimental visualization and theoretical analysis, we uncover a quantitative relationship between the polymer concentration and the finger length prior to breakup. These findings establish a predictive framework for designing viscoelastic interfacial materials with programmable dynamic and offer new opportunities for surface-tension-mediated patterning, emulsification, and fluidic control in soft material systems.

Title: From Heteropolymer Stiffness Distributions to Effective Homopolymers: A Conformational Analysis of Intrinsically Disordered Proteins
Authors: Yannick Witzky, Friederike Schmid, Arash Nikoubashman
Abstract: Intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) are characterized by a lack of defined secondary and tertiary structures, and are thus well-suited for descriptions within polymer theory. However, the intrinsic heterogeneity of proteins, stemming from their diverse amino acid building blocks, introduces local variations in chain stiffness, which can impact conformational behavior at larger scales. To investigate this effect, we developed a heterogeneous worm-like chain model in which the local persistence length follows a Gaussian distribution. We demonstrate that these heterogeneous chains can be effectively mapped to homogeneous chains with a single effective persistence length. To assess whether this mapping can be extended to naturally occurring IDPs, we performed simulations using various coarse-grained IDP models, finding that the simulated IDPs have similar shapes like the corresponding homogeneous and heterogeneous worm-like chains. However, the IDPs are systematically larger than ideal worm-like chains, yet slightly more compact when excluded volume interactions are considered. We attribute these differences to intramolecular interactions between non-bonded monomers, which our theoretical models do not account for.

Title: Modeling dislocations in quasicrystals through amplitude equations
Authors: Marcello De Donno, Luiza Angheluta, Marco Salvalaglio
Abstract: Quasicrystals (QCs) are a class of aperiodic ordered structures that emerge in various systems, from metallic alloys to soft matter and driven non-equilibrium systems. Within a mesoscale theory based on slowly-varying complex amplitudes for QCs, we track dislocations as topological defects harbored by the amplitudes and characterize their Burgers vectors and induced deformations. We study the formation of dislocations at semicoherent interfaces, particularly those emerging from rotated inclusions, and find a hierarchy of dislocations forming at such interfaces. We further analyze interfaces in strained systems, revealing conditions for the emergence of periodic dislocation arrays and discussing the energetics of dislocations associated with different phonon and phason deformations. The stability, interaction, and motion of dislocation dipoles and quadrupoles are also discussed. These findings provide new insights into the mesoscale modeling of dislocations in QCs and their distinct behavior compared to conventional crystals, while demonstrating a versatile framework for studying dislocations in systems exhibiting quasicrystalline order.

Title: Single-site and multi-site solitons of bright matter-waves in optical lattices
Authors: Robbie Cruickshank, Francesco Lorenzi, Arthur La Rooij, Ethan Kerr, Timon Hilker, Stefan Kuhr, Luca Salasnich, Elmar Haller
Abstract: We report the experimental observation of discrete bright matter-wave solitons with attractive interaction in an optical lattice. Using an accordion lattice with adjustable spacing, we prepare a Bose-Einstein condensate of cesium atoms across a defined number of lattice sites. By quenching the interaction strength and the trapping potential, we generate both single-site and multi-site solitons. Our results reveal the existence and characteristics of these solitons across a range of lattice depths and spacings. We identify stable regions of the solitons, based on interaction strength and lattice properties, and compare these findings with theoretical predictions. Our results provide insights into the quench dynamics and collapse mechanisms, paving the way for further studies on transport and dynamical properties of matter-wave solitons in lattices.

Title: Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida interaction revisited: imaginary-time formalism and finite temperature effects
Authors: Mengyao Zhou, Hao-Ran Chang, Lijun Yang, Long Liang
Abstract: Noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals provide a platform for investigating the interplay among magnetism, inversion symmetry breaking, and topologically nontrivial Weyl fermions. The Weyl-mediated Ruderman-Kittel-Kasuya-Yosida (RKKY) interaction may be related to the magnetic orders observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals. Previous studies of RKKY interaction between magnetic impurities in Weyl semimetals found Heisenberg, Ising-like, and Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) types of interactions. However, different range functions are obtained in the literature. In this work, we calculate the Weyl-mediated RKKY interaction by using the divergence-free imaginary-time formalism and obtain exact analytical results at finite temperature. The discrepancies among zero temperature range functions in the literature are resolved. At nonzero temperature, the interaction strength decays exponentially in the long distance limit. But in the short distance limit, the DM interaction shows a thermal enhancement, an effect persists up to higher temperature for shorter distance. This provides a mechanism stabilizing the helical order observed in rare-earth magnetic Weyl semimetals.

Title: Spin demons in d-wave altermagnets
Authors: Pieter M. Gunnink, Jairo Sinova, Alexander Mook
Abstract: Demons are a type of plasmons, which consist of out-of-phase oscillations of electrons in different bands. Here, we show that $d$-wave altermagnets, a recently discovered class of collinear magnetism, naturally realize a spin demon, which consists of out-of-phase movement of the two spin species. The spin demon lives outside of the particle-hole continuum of one of the spin species, and is therefore significantly underdamped, reaching quality factors of $>10$. We show that the spin demon carries a magnetic moment, which inherits the $d$-wave symmetry. Finally, we consider both three and two dimensional $d$-wave altermagnets, and show that spin demons exists in both.

Title: Electronic transport properties of titanium nitride grown by molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Kosuke Takiguchi, Yoshiharu Krockenberger, Tom Ichibha, Kenta Hongo, Ryo Maezono, Yoshitaka Taniyasu, Hideki Yamamoto
Abstract: This study investigates the molecular beam epitaxial (MBE) growth of titanium nitride (TiN) thin films, achieving a high residual resistivity ratio (RRR) of 15.8. We observed a strong correlation between growth temperature and crystalline quality, as reflected in both RRR values and lattice parameter variations. Characterization of superconductivity yielded a Ginzburg-Landau coherence length of 60.4 $\pm$ 0.6 nm, significantly higher than typical sputtered films, suggesting improved superconducting coherence. First-principles calculations, in conjunction with experimental data, provided detailed insights into the electronic structure and transport properties of the TiN films. Temperature-dependent Hall coefficient measurements further revealed the influence of anisotropic scattering mechanisms. These findings establish a promising route for the development of nitride-based superconducting materials for advanced quantum computing technologies.

Title: Uncertainty-aware electronic density-functional distributions
Authors: Teitur Hansen, Jens Jørgen Mortensen, Thomas Bligaard, Karsten Wedel Jacobsen
Abstract: We introduce a method for the estimation of uncertainties in density-functional-theory (DFT) calculations for atomistic systems. The method is based on the construction of an uncertainty-aware functional distribution (UAFD) in a space spanned by a few different exchange-correlation functionals and is illustrated at the level of generalized-gradient-approximation functionals. The UAFD provides reliable estimates of errors -- compared to experiments or higher-quality calculations -- in calculations performed self-consistently with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional. The scheme furthermore allows for a decomposition of the error into a systematic bias and a reduced error. The approach is applied to four different properties: molecular atomization energies, cohesive energies, lattice constants, and bulk moduli of solids. The probability distribution can be tailored to optimize the prediction of a single property or for several properties simultaneously.

Title: Magnetotransport and activation energy of the surface states in Cd3As2 thin films
Authors: Zhigang Cai, Fuxiang Li, Yi-Xiang Wang
Abstract: Recent experiments performed the magnetotransport measurements in (001)-oriented Cd$_3$As$_2$ thin films and attributed the magnetotransport properties to the surface states. In this paper, by using an effective model to describe the surface states, we analyze the Landau bands and then calculate the magnetoconductivities and magnetoresistivities. From these results, the features of two-dimensional quantum Hall effect of the surface states can be captured. More importantly, we reveal that the activation energy is determined by the Hall plateau width, which can explain the experimental observations that the activation energies at odd plateaus are larger than those at even plateaus. We also analyze the roles played by the structural inversion symmetry breaking and impurity scatterings in the magnetotransport, and suggest that their combined effects would lead to the absence of some Hall plateaus.

Title: Electron-transverse acoustic phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides
Authors: Rui Min, Fuxiang Li, Yi-Xiang Wang
Abstract: Transverse acoustic (TA) phonon waves are analogous to electromagnetic waves and can carry a certain angular momentum. In this paper, we study the electron-TA phonon couplings in three-dimensional pentatellurides and explore the conditions under which the TA phonon condensation is stable. We analyze the Lindhard response function, phonon softening, mean-field parameters, and renormalized dispersions, on the basis of which the phase diagrams of the electron-phonon couplings in ZrTe$_5$ and HfTe$_5$ are calculated. The phase diagrams show that, if the chemical potential lies near the Weyl nodes, the TA phonon condensation will dominate and lead to the shear strain wave phase. We further reveal that when the wave vector of the particular phonon mode is smaller, the critical coupling strength will be weaker for the phonon condensation, which thus favors the condensation phase.

Title: Compositional Effects on Structure, Dynamics, Thermodynamic and Mechanical Properties of Zr-Cu-Al alloys
Authors: Kamal G. Soni, Jayraj P. Anadani, Mitanshu B. Vahiya, Kirit N. Lad
Abstract: Zr-Cu-Al alloys belong to a commercially important family of CuZr-based alloys that form bulk metallic glasses on microalloying of Al. However, the identification of compositions with good glass-forming ability and desirable properties from a vast compositional space remains a major challenge due to complex compositional effects on the structure, dynamics and properties. In the present work, we report molecular dynamic investigations of structure, dynamics, thermodynamic and mechanical properties of Zr$_{50}$Cu$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ and Cu$_{50}$Zr$_{50-x}$Al$_x$ alloys ($x=5,10,15,20,25,30,40$) covering a wide compositional space. Our results and findings lead to some important conclusions that could serve as overarching guidelines for choosing good glass-forming alloy compositions that give Zr-Cu-Al glasses with tailored thermal and mechanical properties. Overall, present results suggest that a good glass-forming Zr-Cu-Al alloy composition leading to an MG with good thermal and mechanical properties should be Cu-rich with Zr concentration in the window 30\%-35\% and Al\% > 20. Our results also highlight the impact of icosahedral short- and medium-range ordering on the dynamics and mechanical properties of the alloys. It is observed that the fractions of the full icosahedra $\langle 0,0,12,0 \rangle$ and the degree of their interconnectivity are directly correlated to the structural relaxation, diffusion, dynamic heterogeneity and mechanical properties.

Title: Asymmetric Resonant Ferroelectric Tunnel Junctions for Simultaneous High Tunnel Electroresistance and Low Resistance-Area Product
Authors: Balram Khattar, Adarsh Tripathi, Manmohan Brahma, Abhishek Sharma
Abstract: Ferroelectric tunnel junctions offer potential for non-volatile memory with low power, fast switching, and scalability, but their performance is limited by a high resistance-area product and a low tunnel electroresistance ratio. To address these challenges, we propose a doped HfO2-based, silicon-compatible asymmetric resonant ferroelectric tunnel junction design with a quantum well embedded between two ferroelectric layers, replacing the conventional metal-ferroelectric-metal structure. Using a self-consistent coupling of the non-equilibrium Green's function method with a Preisach-based model, we demonstrate that the quantum well enhances resonant tunneling effects, leading to a simultaneous reduction in the resistance-area product and a boost in the tunnel electroresistance ratio. The low-resistance state becomes more robust, while the high-resistance state is suppressed, improving readout speed and reducing power usage. We observed that incorporating a 2 nm quantum well significantly enhances the tunnel electroresistance ratio, achieving a peak value of approximately 6.15 x 10^4 percent, while simultaneously minimizing the resistance-area product to 47.1 Ohm-cm^2 at 0.175 V. Additionally, the device exhibits negative differential resistance, further enhancing its functionality. Our results confirm that this design enables scalable, energy-efficient, and high-performance non-volatile memory, making it a strong candidate for future memory technologies.

Title: Nonreciprocal Spin-Wave Propagation in Anisotropy-Graded Iron Films Prepared by Nitrogen Implantation
Authors: L. Christienne, J. Jiménez-Bustamante, P. Rovillain, Mahmoud Eddrief, Yunlin Zheng, Franck Fortuna, Massimiliano Marangolo, M. Madami, R. A. Gallardo, P. Landeros, S. Tacchi
Abstract: Gradual modification of the magnetic properties in ferromagnetic films has recently been proposed as an effective method to channel and control spin waves for the development of new functionalities in magnonic devices. Here, we investigate graded FeN films prepared by low-dose nitrogen implantation of Fe epitaxial thin films. Combining Brillouin light scattering measurements and a spin-wave theoretical approach, we show that nitrogen implantation induces a graded profile of both the in-plane and the perpendicular anisotropies along the film thickness. This graduation leads to a significant modification of the spin-wave spatial localization and generates a marked frequency asymmetry in the spin-wave dispersion. Moreover, we find that the anisotropy profile, and as a consequence the dispersion relation, can be tuned on changing the implantation dose, opening a way for the potential use of the graded Fe-N films in magnonic applications.

Title: The interplay between Jahn-Teller distortions and structural degrees of freedom on pseudocubic states in manganite perovskites
Authors: Ben R. M. Tragheim, Elodie A. Harbourne, Clemens Ritter, Andrew L. Goodwin, Mark S. Senn
Abstract: The average structure of the solid solution LaMn$_{1-x}$Ga$_x$O$_3$ (LMGO) has been investigated from a symmetry-motivated approach utilizing synchrotron x-ray and neutron powder diffraction techniques. We show experimentally that a trilinear coupling term ($\Gamma_5^+$M$_2^+$M$_3^+$) between shear strain, octahedral rotation, and the $C$-type orbital ordering mode is responsible for driving the orthorhombic to pseudocubic phase transition occurring in the composition range 0.5 $<$ $x$ $<$ 0.6. Our Monte Carlo simulations elucidate the macroscopic origin of this coupling to shear strain, and point to its importance with respect to controlling the orbital order-disorder transitions. We find that the emergence of the pseudocubic state can be rationalized by considering the competition between this trilinear term and a linear-quadratic term of the out-of-phase octahedral tilting with strain ($\Gamma_5^+$(R$_5^-$)$^2$). Illustrating the general nature of these results, we construct a simple function that captures the change in Landau free energy at the order-disorder transition, in parameters that are trivial to relate to the concentration of Jahn--Teller active species, temperature, tolerance factor and unit cell strain, for a broad range of manganite perovskites. Our results point to the fact that far from the pseudocubic state being a symptom of orbital disorder, it is in many cases more correctly to view it as a cause. The results have a broad impact on the study of orbital ordering physics in the perovskite materials and on chemical and physical control parameters through which to tune the richness of the intertwined physical properties.

Title: Adjustable Molecular Cross-Linkage of MXene Layers for Tunable Charge Transport and VOC Sensing
Authors: Yudhajit Bhattacharjee, Lukas Mielke, Mahmoud Al-Hussein, Shivam Singh, Karen Schaefer, Anik Kumar Ghosh, Carmen Herrmann, Yana Vaynzof, Andreas Fery, Hendrik Schlicke
Abstract: MXenes, two-dimensional transition metal carbides, nitrides or carbonitrides, are emerging as highly promising materials due to their remarkable charge transport characteristics and their versatile surface chemistry. Herein, we demonstrate the tunability of interfaces and the inter-layer spacing between Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ MXene flakes through molecular cross-linking via ligand exchange with homologous diamines. Oleylamine was initially introduced as a ligand, to facilitate the delamination and stable dispersion of pristine Ti$_3$C$_2$T$_X$ flakes in chloroform. Subsequently, controlled cross-linkage of the flakes was achieved using diamine ligands with varying aliphatic chain lengths, enabling the precise tuning of the inter-layer spacing. Grazing incidence X-ray scattering (GIXRD / GIWAXS) confirmed the correlation between ligand chain length and inter-layer spacing, which was further supported by Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. Furthermore, we investigated the charge transport properties of thin films consisting of these diamine cross-linked MXenes and observed a strong dependence of the conductivity on the interlayer spacing. Finally, we probed chemiresistive vapor sensing properties of the MXene composites and observed a pronounced sensitivity and selectivity towards water vapor, highlighting their potential for use in humidity sensors. Providing significant insights into molecular cross-linking of MXenes to form hybrid inorganic/organic composites and its consequences for charge transport, this study opens avenues for the development of next-generation MXene-based electronic devices.

Title: Algorithmic thresholds in combinatorial optimization depend on the time scaling
Authors: M. C. Angelini, M. Avila-González, F. D'Amico, D. Machado, R. Mulet, F. Ricci-Tersenghi
Abstract: In the last decades, many efforts have focused on analyzing typical-case hardness in optimization and inference problems. Some recent work has pointed out that polynomial algorithms exist, running with a time that grows more than linearly with the system size, which can do better than linear algorithms, finding solutions to random problems in a wider range of parameters. However, a theory for polynomial and superlinear algorithms is in general lacking. In this paper, we examine the performance of the Simulated Annealing algorithm, a standard, versatile, and robust choice for solving optimization and inference problems, in the prototypical random $K$-Sat problem. For the first time, we show that the algorithmic thresholds depend on the time scaling of the algorithm with the size of the system. Indeed, one can identify not just one, but different thresholds for linear, quadratic, cubic regimes (and so on). This observation opens new directions in studying the typical case hardness in optimization problems.

Title: Pressure-Tunable Generalized Wigner Crystal and Fractional Chern Insulator in twisted MoTe$_2$
Authors: Bingbing Wang, Junxi Yu, Prakash Sharma, Cheng-Cheng Liu
Abstract: Due to the forming of low-energy flat bands, the moiré superlattices of the transition metal dichalcogenides are fascinating platforms for studying novel correlated states when such flat bands are fractionally filled, with the Coulomb interaction dominating. Here, we demonstrate that pressure can efficiently tune the flatness and quantum geometry of the single-particle bands in twisted bilayer MoTe$_2$ ($\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$). By fractionally filling the topmost valence band, we find that pressure can act as a flexible means to modulate the fractional Chern insulator (FCI) and the generalized Wigner crystal (GWC) and control their many-body topological phase transitions. Moreover, our results indicate a remarkable correspondence between the single-particle band geometry and the formation of FCI and GWC. As the recent experiments report the presence of FCI phases in $\textit{t}$MoTe$_2$, our predictions could be readily implemented experimentally.

Title: Discontinuous depinning/yielding transition of elastic manifolds with tailored internal elasticity
Authors: E. A. Jagla
Abstract: We consider elastic manifolds evolving on disordered energy potentials under the action of an external uniform driving. This scenario includes the cases of {\em depinning} and {\em yielding}, which provide paradigmatic examples of out of equilibrium phase transitions. In both cases, velocity of the manifold is zero at low driving force, and increases smoothly when a critical driving is exceeded,defining a continuous flow-curve for these systems. We show that when more general forms of the manifold elasticity are considered, the flow curve may become reentrant, and the transition hysteretic, or discontinuous. This constitutes a novel scenario for a discontinuous transition out of equilibrium.

Title: Accurate Machine Learning Interatomic Potentials for Polyacene Molecular Crystals: Application to Single Molecule Host-Guest Systems
Authors: Burak Gurlek, Shubham Sharma, Paolo Lazzaroni, Angel Rubio, Mariana Rossi
Abstract: Emerging machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) offer a promising solution for large-scale accurate material simulations, but stringent tests related to the description of vibrational dynamics in molecular crystals remain scarce. Here, we develop a general MLIP by leveraging the graph neural network-based MACE architecture and active-learning strategies to accurately capture vibrational dynamics across a range of polyacene-based molecular crystals, namely naphthalene, anthracene, tetracene and pentacene. Through careful error propagation, we show that these potentials are accurate and enable the study of anharmonic vibrational features, vibrational lifetimes, and vibrational coupling. In particular, we investigate large-scale host-guest systems based on these molecular crystals, showing the capacity of molecular-dynamics-based techniques to explain and quantify vibrational coupling between host and guest nuclear motion. Our results establish a framework for understanding vibrational signatures in large-scale complex molecular systems and thus represent an important step for engineering vibrational interactions in molecular environments.

Title: Ab initio Maxwell-Bloch Approach for X-Ray Excitations in Two-Dimensional Materials
Authors: Joris Sturm, Ivan Maliyov, Dominik Christiansen, Malte Selig, Marco Bernardi, Andreas Knorr
Abstract: The combination of Maxwell and X-ray Bloch equations forms an appropriate framework to describe ultrafast time-resolved X-ray experiments on attosecond time scale in crystalline solids. However, broadband experiments such as X-ray absorption near edge spectroscopy or resonant inelastic X-ray scattering require a detailed knowledge of the electronic structure and transition matrix elements. Here, we show how to fill this gap by combining the Maxwell-X-ray Bloch formalism with first-principles calculations treating explicitly the core states. The resulting X-ray absorption spectrum recovers key spectral signatures which were missing in our previous work relying on a semi-empirical tight-binding approach.

Title: Emergent Magnetic Structures at the 2D Limit of the Altermagnet MnTe
Authors: Marc G. Cuxart, Roberto Robles, Beatriz Muñiz Cano, Pierluigi Gargiani, Clara Rebanal, Iolanda Di Bernardo, Alireza Amiri, Fabián Calleja, Manuela Garnica, Miguel A. Valbuena, Amadeo L. Vázquez de Parga
Abstract: MnTe has recently emerged as a canonical altermagnet, a newly identified class of magnetism characterized by compensated antiferromagnetic order coexisting with spin-split electronic bands, traditionally considered exclusive to ferromagnets. However, the extent to which altermagnetism persists as altermagnets are thinned to the two-dimensional (2D) limit remains unexplored. Here, we investigate the magnetic behaviour of 2D MnTe, specifically atomically-thin monolayers (MLs) and bilayers (BLs) grown on graphene/Ir(111) substrate, by combining experimental scanning tunneling microscopy, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, x-ray absorption spectroscopy and x-ray magnetic circular dichroism with density functional theory calculations. We find that while ML and BL MnTe adopt atomic structures with symmetries incompatible with altermagnetism, they exhibit intriguing magnetic phases: the BL forms a highly-robust layered antiferromagnet with in-plane spin anisotropy, whereas the ML exhibits a spin-glass-like behavior below its freezing temperature, a phenomenon not previously observed in an atomically thin material. These findings highlight how reduced dimensionality can promote the emergence of unusual magnetic structures distinct from those of their three-dimensional counterparts, providing new insights into low-dimensional magnetism.

Title: Influence of a Xenon interlayer on dissociative electron attachment to deuterated methane on a platinum substrate
Authors: Norhan Omar, Pierre Cloutier, Christophe Ramseyer, Léon Sanche, Michel Fromm
Abstract: We investigate the impact of intercalating a xenon layer between a thin condensed CD4 film of two monolayers (ML) and a platinum surface on the dissociative electron attachment (DEA). The observed desorption results are compared with density functional theory (DFT) calculations, which reveal the binding energies of various anionic and neutral species as a function of the xenon film thickness on the Pt (111) substrate. The theoretical results suggest that 6 ML of xenon are sufficient to diminish the surface effect, enabling physisorbed anionic fragments to desorb from the CD4 film. In contrast, 20 ML (approximately 10 nm) are experimentally necessary to achieve saturation in the desorption of D-. In addition, the presence of xenon layers enables the coupling of resonance states with Xe excited states, thereby inhibiting the electrons from returning to the metal. Aside from reducing surface interactions, the xenon interlayer significantly enhances DEA to CD4.

Title: Remote electric-field control of antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons
Authors: Dmitriy Yavorskiy, Jan Suffczyński, Rafał Kowerdziej, Olga Strzeżysz, Jerzy Wróbel, Wojciech Knap, Marcin Białek
Abstract: The control of hybrid light-matter states, specifically magnon-polaritons that emerge from the strong coupling between magnons and cavity photons, remains a key challenge in developing reconfigurable quantum and classical devices. Here, we showcase the ability to remotely control antiferromagnetic magnon-polaritons at room temperature using electric field by integrating a highly birefringent liquid crystal layer into a terahertz Fabry-Pérot cavity containing an antiferromagnetic crystal. Positioned several millimeters from the magnetic material, the liquid crystal allows for adjusting the cavity's photonic environment through electric field. This adjustment, in turn, influences the coupling strength of a particular cavity mode to the magnon resonance, thereby controlling the extent of magnon dressing by cavity photons. Our approach facilitates dynamic and reversible tuning of magnon-photon hybridization without the need for direct electrical contact or alterations to the magnetic medium. These findings create the conditions for voltage-programmable terahertz magnonic devices and new possibilities for noninvasive control strategies in spin-based information processing technologies.

Title: Current response to axial gauge fields in noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals
Authors: Long Liang
Abstract: We investigate the electric current response to axial gauge fields in noncentrosymmetric magnetic Weyl semimetals. The absence of both time-reversal and inversion symmetries allows for new types of responses. We systematically calculate the transverse, longitudinal, and Hall responses to axial gauge potentials with both linear and quadratic dispersion relations. The transverse and Hall responses are of comparable magnitude, while the longitudinal response is much smaller. Notably, with increasing frequency, the transverse and Hall response functions manifest a peak whose height is determined by the properties of Weyl fermions and is independent of the axial gauge potential. The main features of the response functions survive in the presence of disorders. As applications of our results, we propose a Hall type magnetopiezoelectric effect, where a transverse sound wave can induce an electric current whose direction is perpendicular to the directions of sound propagation and polarization. Our results also provide a mechanism to excite magnons using electric fields and could be useful for magnon spintronics.

Title: Giant Magnetocaloric Effect in Spin Supersolid Candidate Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$

Abstract: Supersolid, an exotic quantum state of matter that consists of particles forming an incompressible solid structure while simultaneously showing superfluidity of zero viscosity [1], is one of the long-standing pursuits in fundamental research [2, 3]. Although the initial report of $^4$He supersolid turned out to be an artifact [4], this intriguing quantum matter has inspired enthusiastic investigations into ultracold quantum gases [5-8]. Nevertheless, the realization of supersolidity in condensed matter remains elusive. Here we find evidence for a quantum magnetic analogue of supersolid -- the spin supersolid -- in the recently synthesized triangular-lattice antiferromagnet Na$_2$BaCo(PO$_4$)$_2$ [9]. Notably, a giant magnetocaloric effect related to the spin supersolidity is observed in the demagnetization cooling process, manifesting itself as two prominent valley-like regimes, with the lowest temperature attaining below 100 mK. Not only is there an experimentally determined series of critical fields but the demagnetization cooling profile also shows excellent agreement with the theoretical simulations with an easy-axis Heisenberg model. Neutron diffractions also successfully locate the proposed spin supersolid phases by revealing the coexistence of three-sublattice spin solid order and interlayer incommensurability indicative of the spin superfluidity. Thus, our results indicate a strong entropic effect of the spin supersolid phase in a frustrated quantum magnet and open up a viable and promising avenue for applications in sub-Kelvin refrigeration, especially in the context of persistent concerns about helium shortages [10, 11].

Title: Energy-resolved tip-orbital fingerprint in scanning tunneling spectroscopy based on the revised Chen's derivative rule
Authors: Ivan Abilio, Krisztián Palotás
Abstract: The revised Chen's derivative rule for electron tunneling is implemented to enable computationally efficient first-principles-based calculations of the differential conductance dI/dV for scanning tunneling spectroscopy (STS) simulations. The probing tip is included through a single tip apex atom, and its electronic structure can be modeled as a linear combination of electron orbitals of various symmetries, or can be directly transferred from first-principles electronic structure calculations. By taking pristine and boron- or nitrogen-doped graphene sheets as sample surfaces, the reliability of our implementation is demonstrated by comparing its results to those obtained by the Tersoff-Hamann and Bardeen's electron tunneling models. It is highlighted that the energy-resolved direct and interference contributions to dI/dV arising from the tip's electron orbitals result in a fingerprint of the particular combined surface-tip system. The significant difference between the electron acceptor boron and donor nitrogen dopants in graphene is reflected in their dI/dV fingerprints. The presented theoretical method allows for an unprecedented physical understanding of the electron tunneling process in terms of tip-orbital-resolved energy-dependent dI/dV maps, that is anticipated to be extremely useful for investigating the local electronic properties of novel material surfaces in the future.

Title: Crystal nucleation and growth in high-entropy alloys revealed by atomic electron tomography
Authors: Yakun Yuan, Saman Moniri, Yao Yang, Jihan Zhou, Andrew Yuan, Dennis S. Kim, Yongsoo Yang, Chenyang Li, Wei Chen, Peter Ercius, Jianwei Miao
Abstract: High-entropy alloys (HEAs) balance mixing entropy and intermetallic phase formation enthalpy, creating a vast compositional space for structural and functional materials (1-6). They exhibit exceptional strength-ductility trade-offs in metallurgy (4-10) and near-continuum adsorbate binding energies in catalysis (11-16). A deep understanding of crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs is essential for controlling their formation and optimizing their structural and functional properties. However, atomic-scale nucleation in HEAs challenges traditional theories based on one or two principal elements (17-23). The intricate interplay of structural and chemical orders among multiple principal elements further obscures our understanding of nucleation pathways (5,24-27). Due to the lack of direct three-dimensional (3D) atomic-scale observations, previous studies have relied on simulations and indirect measurements (28-32), leaving HEA nucleation and growth fundamentally elusive. Here, we advance atomic electron tomography (33,34) to resolve the 3D atomic structure and chemical composition of 7,662 HEA and 498 medium-entropy alloy nuclei at different nucleation stages. We observe local structural order that decreases from core to boundary, correlating with local chemical order. As nuclei grow, structural order improves. At later stages, most nuclei coalesce without misorientation, while some form coherent twin boundaries. To explain these experimental observations, we propose the gradient nucleation pathways model, in which the nucleation energy barrier progressively increases through multiple evolving intermediate states. We expect these findings to not only provide fundamental insights into crystal nucleation and growth in HEAs, but also offer a general framework for understanding nucleation mechanisms in other materials.

Title: Hunting for Maxwell's Demon in the Wild
Authors: Johan du Buisson, Jannik Ehrich, Matthew P. Leighton, Avijit Kundu, Tushar K. Saha, John Bechhoefer, David A. Sivak
Abstract: The apparent paradox of Maxwell's demon motivated the development of information thermodynamics and, more recently, engineering advances enabling the creation of nanoscale information engines. From these advances, it is now understood that nanoscale machines like the molecular motors within cells can in principle operate as Maxwell demons. This motivates the question: does information help power molecular motors? Answering this would seemingly require simultaneous measurement of all system degrees of freedom, which is generally intractable in single-molecule experiments. To overcome this limitation, we derive a statistical estimator to infer both the direction and magnitude of subsystem heat flows, and thus to determine whether -- and how strongly -- a motor operates as a Maxwell demon. The estimator uses only trajectory measurements for a single degree of freedom. We demonstrate the estimator by applying it to simulations of an experimental realization of an information engine and a kinesin molecular motor. Our results show that kinesin transitions to a Maxwell-demon mechanism in the presence of nonequilibrium noise, with a corresponding increase in velocity consistent with experiments. These findings suggest that molecular motors may have evolved to leverage active fluctuations within cells.

Title: Organisation and dynamics of individual DNA segments in topologically complex genomes
Authors: Saminathan Ramakrishnan, Auro Varat Patnaik, Guglielmo Grillo, Luca Tubiana, Davide Michieletto
Abstract: Capturing the physical organisation and dynamics of genomic regions is one of the major open challenges in biology. The kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) is a topologically complex genome, made by thousands of DNA (mini and maxi) circles interlinked into a two-dimensional Olympic network. The organisation and dynamics of these DNA circles are poorly understood. In this paper, we show that dCas9 linked to Quantum Dots can efficiently label different classes of DNA minicircles in kDNA. We use this method to study the distribution and dynamics of different classes of DNA minicircles within the network. We discover that maxicircles display a preference to localise at the periphery of the network and that they undergo subdiffusive dynamics. From the latter, we can also quantify the effective network stiffness, confirming previous indirect estimations via AFM. Our method could be used more generally, to quantify the location, dynamics and material properties of genomic regions in other complex genomes, such as that of bacteria, and to study their behaviour in the presence of DNA-binding proteins.

Title: Deciphering the Structure of Push-Pull Conjugated Polymer Aggregates in Solution and Film
Authors: Thomas P. Chaney, Christine LaPorte Mahajan, Masoud Ghasemi, Andrew J. Levin, Keith P. White, Scott T. Milner, Enrique D. Gomez, Michael F. Toney
Abstract: The morphology of conjugated polymer films is highly tunable, influencing their performance in organic electronics. Specifically, molecular packing or crystal structure strongly influence electronic processes such as light absorption and charge transfer. However, the unit cells of high-performance electron donor polymers remain unknown, limiting the understanding of how processing affects structure and device performance. This study characterizes the aggregate structure of PM6-type push-pull polymers using X-ray scattering, cryogenic electron microscopy, and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. A novel forward simulation approach linking grazing-incidence wide-angle X-ray scattering (GIWAXS) with MD resolves a monoclinic unit cell that accurately describes PM6-type polymer aggregates in both thin films and casting solutions. Intimate pi-pi stacking between donor and acceptor units emerges from this unit cell. Analysis of experimental GIWAXS using this unit cell quantifies sliding disorder in these aggregates, which may impact device performance. The shape and internal structure of solution aggregates are also identified in chlorobenzene. These findings enhance our understanding of PM6-type polymer packing, outline a strategy for elucidating the crystal structure of weakly ordered materials, and provide an opportunity to control optoelectronic performance through aggregate formation in PM6 and other push-pull conjugated polymers.

Title: Taxonomy of Prediction
Authors: Alexandra Jurgens, James P. Crutchfield
Abstract: A prediction makes a claim about a system's future given knowledge of its past. A retrodiction makes a claim about its past given knowledge of its future. We introduce the ambidextrous hidden Markov chain that does both optimally -- the bidirectional machine whose state structure makes explicit all statistical correlations in a stochastic process. We introduce an informational taxonomy to profile these correlations via a suite of multivariate information measures. While prior results laid out the different kinds of information contained in isolated measurements, in addition to being limited to single measurements the associated informations were challenging to calculate explicitly. Overcoming these via bidirectional machine states, we expand that analysis to information embedded across sequential measurements. The result highlights fourteen new interpretable and calculable information measures that fully characterize a process' informational structure. Additionally, we introduce a labeling and indexing scheme that systematizes information-theoretic analyses of highly complex multivariate systems. Operationalizing this, we provide algorithms to directly calculate all of these quantities in closed form for finitely-modeled processes.

Title: Solving the Phase Problem of Diffraction: X-ray Standing Waves Imaging on Bismuthene/SiC(0001)
Authors: Niclas Tilgner, Susanne Wolff, Serguei Soubatch, Tien-Lin Lee, Fabian Göhler, F. Stefan Tautz, Thomas Seyller, Philip Schädlich, Christian Kumpf
Abstract: The phase retrieval problem is a fundamental shortcoming of all diffraction-based methods, arising from the inability to measure the phase of scattered waves. The (normal incidence) X-ray standing wave (NIXSW) technique circumvents this issue by introducing a (Bragg-generated) X-ray standing wave field throughout the sample, relative to which any atomic species can be localized by probing its fluorescence or photoelectron yield. In essence, in a single measurement the complex scattering factor (i.e., its amplitude \textit{and} phase) corresponding to the used Bragg reflection is determined. Performing this for multiple Bragg reflections enables one to reconstruct the scattering density of the sample in three dimensions, straightforwardly as the Fourier sum of all measured (complex) scattering factors. Here, we utilize this technique to reveal the structural key features involved in the formation of the quantum spin Hall insulator bismuthene on silicon carbide. In this prominent example, the two-dimensional Bi layer is confined between a 4H-SiC substrate crystal and an epitaxial graphene layer. The key finding is a change in the adsorption site of the Bi atoms underneath the graphene upon hydrogenation, caused by the H-saturation of one (out of three) Si dangling bonds per unit cell. This structural change, clearly revealed by our NIXSW imaging experiment, is the key feature leading to the formation of the characteristic band structure of the 2D bismuthene honeycomb.

Title: A tutorial on simulating nonlinear behaviors of flexible structures with the discrete differential geometry (DDG) method
Authors: Weicheng Huang, Zhuonan Hao, Jiahao Li, Dezhong Tong, Kexin Guo, Yingchao Zhang, Huajian Gao, K. Jimmy Hsia, Mingchao Liu
Abstract: Flexible elastic structures, such as beams, rods, ribbons, plates, and shells, exhibit complex nonlinear dynamical behaviors that are central to a wide range of engineering and scientific applications, including soft robotics, deployable structures, and biomedical devices. While various numerical methods have been developed to simulate these behaviors, many conventional approaches struggle to simultaneously capture geometric and material nonlinearities, as well as nonlinear external interactions, particularly in highly deformable and dynamically evolving systems. The Discrete Differential Geometry (DDG) method has emerged as a robust and efficient numerical framework that intrinsically preserves geometric properties, accommodates material nonlinearity, and accurately models interactions with external environments and fields. By directly discretizing geometric and mechanical quantities, DDG provides an accurate, stable, and efficient approach to modeling flexible structures, addressing key limitations of traditional numerical methods. This tutorial provides a systematic introduction to the DDG method for simulating nonlinear behaviors in flexible structures. It covers DDG theory, simulation frameworks, and MATLAB implementation, with examples spanning dynamic systems, geometric and material nonlinearities, and external interactions like magnetics and fluids, culminating in practical insights and future directions. By offering a comprehensive and practical guide, together with open-source MATLAB code, this tutorial aims to facilitate the broader adoption of DDG-based numerical tools among researchers and engineers in computational mechanics, applied mathematics, and structural design.

Title: Probing the Quantum Geometry of Correlated Metals using Optical Conductivity
Authors: Deven P. Carmichael, Martin Claassen
Abstract: Recent studies have revealed that the quantum geometry of electronic bands determines the electromagnetic properties of non-interacting insulators and semimetals. However, the role of quantum geometry in the optical responses of interacting electron systems remains largely unexplored. Here we examine the interplay between Coulomb interactions and Bloch-band quantum geometry in clean metals. We demonstrate that the low-frequency optical conductivity of a correlated metal encodes the structure of Bloch wave functions at the Fermi surface. This response originates from integrating out highly off-resonant interband scattering processes enabled by Coulomb interactions. The resulting quantum-geometric contribution appears generically in multiband systems, but becomes the dominant effect in the optical conductivity for a parabolic band. We consider a dilute correlated metal near a topological band inversion and show that the doping dependence of optical absorption can measure how the orbital character of Bloch wave functions changes at the Fermi surface. Our results illustrate how the confluence of quantum geometry and Coulomb interactions can enable optical processes and enrich the physics of Fermi liquids.

Title: SymTFT construction of gapless exotic-foliated dual models
Authors: Fabio Apruzzi, Francesco Bedogna, Salvo Mancani
Abstract: We construct Symmetry Topological Field Theories (SymTFTs) for continuous subsystem symmetries, which are inherently non-Lorentz-invariant. Our framework produces dual bulk descriptions -- gapped foliated and exotic SymTFTs -- that generates gapless boundary theories with spontaneous subsystem symmetry breaking via interval compactification. In analogy with the sandwich construction of SymTFT, we call this Mille-feuille. This is done by specifying gapped and symmetry-breaking boundary conditions. In this way we obtain the foliated dual realizations of various models, including the XY plaquette, XYZ cube, and $\phi$, $\hat{\phi}$ theories. This also captures self-duality symmetries as condensation defects and provides a systematic method for generating free theories that non-linearly realize subsystem symmetries.

Title: Intermediate phases in $α$-RuCl$_3$ under in-plane magnetic field via interlayer spin interactions
Authors: Jiefu Cen, Hae-Young Kee
Abstract: $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ has attracted significant attention as a prime candidate for the spin-1/2 Kitaev spin liquid in two-dimensional honeycomb lattices. Although its ground state is magnetically ordered, the order is suppressed under a moderate in-plane magnetic field. The intermediate regime of the field has exotic behaviours, some of which are claimed to originate from a Kitaev spin liquid. In resolving debates surrounding these behaviours, the interlayer interactions in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ have been largely overlooked due to their perceived weakness in van der Waals materials. However, near the transition, they may become significant as the field energy approaches the interlayer coupling scale. Here we investigate the effects of interlayer couplings in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$ with $R\bar{3}$ and $C2/m$ structures. We first examine their effects on the transition temperature ($T_N$) using classical Monte Carlo simulations. We found that the interlayer couplings have minimal effects on $T_N$, and the different $T_N$ between the two structures are mainly due to the anisotropy in the intralayer interactions. Focusing on the $R{\bar 3}$ structure, we show that the nearest neighbour interlayer interaction is XXZ-type due to the symmetry, and the next nearest neighbor interaction of the Kitaev-type is crucial for the transition between two zigzag orders under an in-plane field. Furthermore, an intermediate phase with a large unit cell emerges due to the interlayer interactions. Our findings provide new insights into the exotic behaviours and sample dependence reported in $\alpha$-RuCl$_3$.

Title: Higher-Form Anomalies Imply Intrinsic Long-Range Entanglement
Authors: Po-Shen Hsin, Ryohei Kobayashi, Abhinav Prem
Abstract: We show that generic gapped quantum many-body states which respect an anomalous finite higher-form symmetry have an exponentially small overlap with any short-range entangled (SRE) state. Hence, anomalies of higher-form symmetries enforce $intrinsic$ long-range entanglement, which is in contrast with anomalies of ordinary (0-form) symmetries which are compatible with symmetric SRE states (specifically, symmetric cat states). As an application, we show that the anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries provide a diagnostic for mixed-state topological order in $d \geq 2$ spatial dimensions. We also identify a new (3+1)D intrinsic mixed-state topological order that does not obey remote-detectability by local decoherence of the (3+1)D Toric Code with fermionic loop excitations. This breakdown of remote detectability, as encoded in anomalies of strong higher-form symmetries, provides a partial characterization of intrinsically mixed-state topological order.

Title: Measuring Casimir Force Across a Superconducting Transition
Authors: Minxing Xu, Robbie J. G. Elbertse, Ata Keşkekler, Giuseppe Bimonte, Jinwon Lee, Sander Otte, Richard A. Norte
Abstract: The Casimir effect and superconductivity are foundational quantum phenomena whose interaction remains an open question in physics. How Casimir forces behave across a superconducting transition remains unresolved, owing to the experimental difficulty of achieving alignment, cryogenic environments, and isolating small changes from competing effects. This question carries implications for electron physics, quantum gravity, and high-temperature superconductivity. Here we demonstrate an on-chip superconducting platform that overcomes these challenges, achieving one of the most parallel Casimir configurations to date. Our microchip-based cavities achieve unprecedented area-to-separation ratio between plates, exceeding previous Casimir experiments by orders of magnitude and generating the strongest Casimir forces yet between compliant surfaces. Scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is used for the first time to directly detect the resonant motion of a suspended membrane, with subatomic precision in both lateral positioning and displacement. Such precision measurements across a superconducting transition allow for the suppression of all van der Waals, electrostatic, and thermal effects. Preliminary measurements suggest superconductivity-dependent shifts in the Casimir force, motivating further investigation and comparison with theories. By uniting extreme parallelism, nanomechanics, and STM readout, our platform opens a new experimental frontier at the intersection of Casimir physics and superconductivity.

Title: Restoring the second law to classical-quantum dynamics
Authors: Isaac Layton, Harry J. D. Miller
Abstract: All physical theories should obey the second law of thermodynamics. However, existing proposals to describe the dynamics of hybrid classical-quantum systems either violate the second law or lack a proof of its existence. Here we rectify this by studying classical-quantum dynamics that are (1) linear and completely-positive and (2) preserve the thermal state of the classical-quantum system. We first prove that such dynamics necessarily satisfy the second law. We then show how these dynamics may be constructed, proposing dynamics that generalise the standard Langevin and Fokker-Planck equations for classical systems in thermal environments to include back-reaction from a quantum degree of freedom. Deriving necessary and sufficient conditions for completely-positive, linear and continuous classical-quantum dynamics to satisfy detailed balance, we find this property satisfied by our dynamics. To illustrate the formalism and its applications we introduce two models. The first is an analytically solvable model of an overdamped classical system coupled to a quantum two-level system, which we use to study the total entropy production in both quantum system and classical measurement apparatus during a quantum measurement. The second describes an underdamped classical-quantum oscillator system subject to friction, which we numerically demonstrate exhibits thermalisation in the adiabatic basis, showing the relevance of our dynamics for the mixed classical-quantum simulation of molecules.

Title: Simulating lattice fermion doubling with a Floquet drive
Authors: Raúl A. Briceño, William Gyory, Thomas Iadecola, Srimoyee Sen
Abstract: We consider a recently discovered mathematical correspondence between the spectra of a naively discretized lattice fermion and that of a periodically driven (i.e., Floquet) quantum system and turn it into an infrared equivalence between the two systems. The equivalence can be framed as a duality relation, allowing us to simulate a two-flavor discrete-time fermion theory on the lattice side, where the two flavors arise from time discretization, using a single-flavor fermion theory on the Floquet side. Our demonstration establishes an equivalence between (i) the fermion content, (ii) the correlation functions, and consequently (iii) observables of the two theories in the infrared. We also show how interactions may be incorporated into this equivalence.

Title: Heat operator approach to quantum stochastic thermodynamics in the strong-coupling regime
Authors: Sheikh Parvez Mandal, Mahasweta Pandit, Khalak Mahadeviya, Mark T. Mitchison, Javier Prior
Abstract: Open quantum systems exchange heat with their environments and the fluctuations of this heat carry crucial signatures of the underlying dynamical processes. Within the well-established two-point measurement scheme and employing thermofield dynamics, we identify a 'heat operator,' whose moments with respect to the vacuum state correspond to the stochastic moments of the heat exchanged with a thermal bath. This recasts the computation of heat statistics as a standard unitary time-evolution problem, allowing us to leverage powerful tensor-network techniques for simulating quantum dynamics. In particular, we exploit the chain mapping of thermodynamic reservoirs to compute heat fluctuations in the Ohmic spin-boson model. The method, however, is general and applies to arbitrary open quantum systems coupled to non-interacting (bosonic or fermionic) thermal environments, offering a powerful, non-perturbative framework for understanding heat transfer in open quantum systems.

Title: Measuring coherent dynamics of a superconducting qubit in an open waveguide
Authors: Aidar Sultanov, Evgeniya Mutsenik, Matthias Schmelz, Leonie Kaczmarek, Gregor Oelsner, Uwe Hübner, Ronny Stolz, Evgeni Il'ichev
Abstract: We measured the relaxation and decoherence rates of a superconducting transmon qubit in a resonator-free setting. In our experiments, the qubit is coupled to an open coplanar waveguide such that the transmission of microwaves through this line depends on the qubit's state. To determine the occupation of the first excited qubit energy level, we introduced a two-pulse technique. The first applied pulse, at a frequency close to the eigenfrequency of the qubit, serves to excite the qubit. A second pulse is then used for probing the transition between the first and second excited energy levels. Utilizing this measurement technique allowed for the reconstruction of the relaxation dynamics and Rabi oscillations. Furthermore, we demonstrate the consistency between the extracted parameters and the corresponding estimations from frequency-domain measurements.

Title: Synthesis and characterization of gold-coated nanodiamonds through green chemistry as potential radiosensitizers for proton therapy
Authors: Edgar Mendes, Ana Belchior, Federico Picollo, Marta M. Alves, Rodica Mihaela Dinica, Maria Joao Moura, Teresa Pinheiro, Maria Paula Cabral Campello
Abstract: In this work the synthesis and characterization of novel gold-nanodiamond nanoparticles was performed. The synthesis was based on the reduction of gold onto the different types of nanodiamond (annealed or annealed and oxidized, 50 or 230 nm) using root extracts of Nympheaea alba as a reducing agent. These gold-coated nanodiamonds were characterized by UV-Vis, PXRD, DLS, zeta-potential, PIXE, Raman, SEM, and TEM, assessing particle size, stability, and gold coating effectiveness. Cellular studies in the A549 and Panc1 cancer cell lines assessed uptake, cytotoxicity, and colony formation to evaluate NDAu's biological activity. NDAu demonstrated strong cellular uptake and cytotoxic effects in A549 and Panc1 cell lines, reducing cell survival in clonogenic assay. Futher research in the capabilites of these nanoparticles for proton therapy will be performed.

Title: Non-stabilizerness in open XXZ spin chains: Universal scaling and dynamics
Authors: Doru Sticlet, Balázs Dóra, Dominik Szombathy, Gergely Zaránd, Cătălin Paşcu Moca
Abstract: Magic, or non-stabilizerness, is a crucial quantum resource, yet its dynamics in open quantum systems remain largely unexplored. We investigate magic in the open XXZ spin chain under either boundary gain and loss, or bulk dephasing using the stabilizer Rényi entropy $M_2$. To enable scalable simulations of large systems, we develop a novel, highly efficient algorithm for computing $M_2$ within the matrix product states formalism while maintaining constant bond dimension--an advancement over existing methods. For boundary driving, we uncover universal scaling laws, $M_2(t) \sim t^{1/z}$, linked to the dynamical exponent $z$ for several distinct universality classes. We also disentangle classical and quantum contributions to magic by introducing a mean-field approximation for magic, thus emphasizing the prominent role of quantum critical fluctuations in non-stabilizerness. For bulk dephasing, dissipation can transiently enhance magic before suppressing it, and drive it to a nontrivial steady-state value. These findings position magic as a powerful diagnostic tool for probing universality and dynamics in open quantum systems.

Title: Field-effect detected magnetic resonance of NV centers in diamond based on all-carbon Schottky contacts
Authors: Xuan Phuc Le, Ludovic Mayer, Simone Magaletti, Martin Schmidt, Jean-François Roch, Thierry Debuisschert
Abstract: The nitrogen vacancy (NV) center is a defect in diamond whose spin state can be read optically by exploiting its photoluminescence or electrically by exploiting its charge generation rate under illumination, both of which being spin-dependent. The latter method offers numerous opportunities in terms of integration and performance compared to conventional optical reading. Here, we investigate the physical properties of a graphitic-diamond-graphitic structure under illumination. We show how, for a type IIa diamond material, electron-hole pairs generated by an ensemble of NV centers lead to a p-type material upon illumination, making this all-carbon structure equivalent to two back-to-back Schottky diodes. We analyze how the reverse current flowing upon illumination changes as a function of bias voltage and radiofrequency-induced excitation of the NV ensemble spin resonances. Furthermore, we demonstrate how an additional field effect arising from the illumination scheme affects the reverse current, resulting in a photoelectrical signal that can exceed the optical signal under the same illumination conditions.

Title: Time-Resolved Stokes Analysis of Single Photon Emitters in Hexagonal Boron Nitride
Authors: Çağlar Samaner, Serkan Ateş
Abstract: Solid-state quantum emitters play a vital role in advancing quantum technologies, particularly in quantum computation and communication, where single-photon polarization acts as a fundamental information carrier. Precise polarization characterization is essential for understanding the mechanisms underlying polarization dynamics, which is critical for developing quantum emitters with minimized polarization-related errors. In this study, we employ the Rotating Quarter-Wave Plate (RQWP) method to comprehensively characterize the polarization state of quantum emitters in hexagonal boron nitride (hBN). By examining both time-averaged and dynamic polarization features, we demonstrate the time-resolved evolution of Stokes parameters from a solid-state single-photon emitter using the RQWP technique. This approach provides more complete polarization information than conventional micro-photoluminescence methods, without requiring modifications to the experimental setup. Our results uncover intricate polarization dynamics in hBN emitters, offering insights that were previously inaccessible. The techniques presented here can be broadly applied to polarization analysis of solid-state quantum emitters across various material platforms.

Title: Dynamical Casimir effect in superconducting cavities: from photon generation to universal quantum gates
Authors: Fernando C. Lombardo, Paula I. Villar
Abstract: This chapter explores various aspects of the Dynamical Casimir Effect (DCE) and its implications in the context of circuit quantum electrodynamics (cQED). We begin by reviewing the origin and fundamental properties of the DCE, including three equivalent mathematical frameworks that offer complementary perspectives on the phenomenon. These formulations will serve as a foundation for the subsequent analyses. We then turn our attention to the practical realization of the DCE in cQED-based architectures, discussing how modern superconducting circuits can be engineered to exhibit this inherently quantum effect. Building on this, we examine how the presence of the DCE influences the performance of a quantum thermal machine operating with a quantum field, shedding light on the interplay between quantum fluctuations and thermodynamic processes. Further, we demonstrate how the DCE can be harnessed to implement a controlled-squeeze gate within a cQED platform, opening a path toward advanced quantum control and quantum information processing. The chapter concludes with a synthesis of the main results and a discussion of potential future directions.

Title: Parametric mechanism of the magnetization reversal as a low-power recording mechanism for MRAM. Measurement of spin-accumulation-induced in-plane magnetic field in a FeB nanomagnet
Authors: Vadym Zayets
Abstract: The parametric torque presents a promising recording mechanism for MRAM, complementing Spin Transfer Torque and Spin Orbit Torque, enabling magnetization reversal in a nanomagnet using a DC electrical current. Its resonance nature allows for optimization of magnetization reversal at a lower current, presenting an opportunity for a lower recording current and, therefore, for efficient and high-performance operation in modern MRAM technology. The in-plane magnetic field generated by spin accumulation serves as the driving force behind this torque. Experimental measurements of the current-induced in-plane magnetic field in the FeB nanomagnet reveal its magnitude to be around 40 Gauss at a current density of 25 mA/$\mu m^2$, a value adequate for facilitating parametric magnetization reversal. The parametric torque is analytically calculated by solving the Landau-Lifshitz equation. Analytical calculations demonstrate its potential in advancing modern MRAM technology.

Title: X-type stacking in cross-chain antiferromagnets

Abstract: Physical phenomena in condensed matter normally arise from the collective effect of all atoms, while selectively addressing a lone atomic sublattice by external stimulus is elusive. The later functionality may, however, benefit various applications, as the response may differ when the external stimulus affects only a specific sublattice rather than the entire solid. Here, we introduce cross-chain antiferromagnets, where the stacking of two magnetic sublattices forms a pattern of intersecting atomic chains, allowing for the sublattice selectivity. We dub this antiferromagnetic (AFM) stacking X-type and demonstrate that it exhibits unique spin-dependent transport properties not present in conventional magnets. Through high-throughput analyses and computations, we unveil three prototypes of X-type AFM stacking and identify 15 candidate candidates. Using $\beta$-Fe$_{2}$PO$_{5}$ as a representative X-type antiferromagnet, we predict sublattice-selective spin-polarized transport driven by the X-type stacking, where one magnetic sublattice conducts, while the other does not. Consequently, a spin torque can be exerted solely on a single sublattice, leading to unconventional ultrafast dynamics of the Nèel vector capable of deterministic switching of the AFM domains. Our work uncovers a previously overlooked type of magnetic moment stacking and reveals sublattice-selective physical properties promising for high-performance spintronic applications.

Title: Reciprocal and nonreciprocal paraconductivity in bilayer multiphase superconductors
Authors: Tsugumi Matsumoto, Youichi Yanase, Akito Daido
Abstract: Thin-film multiphase superconductors are attracting much attention, and it is important to propose how to detect them in experiments. In this work, we study the reciprocal and nonreciprocal paraconductivity of a bilayer model with staggered Rashba-type spin-orbit coupling with and without the potential gradient and Zeeman field. This model shows the Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer phase, the pair-density-wave phase, and the Fulde-Ferrell-Larkin-Ovchinnikov (FFLO) phase, and we focus on how their properties are encoded to the charge transport. We show that the reciprocal paraconductivity has a peak associated with the phase transitions between different superconducting states due to the degeneracy of the transition temperatures as well as the paramagnetic depairing effect. We also show that the FFLO superconducting state shows a sizable nonreciprocal paraconductivity once the degeneracy of Cooper pairs is lifted by applying the potential gradient. Observation of the peaked reciprocal and nonreciprocal paraconductivity can be used as a probe of multiphase superconductivity.

Title: Subgap transport in superconductor--semiconductor hybrid islands: Weak and strong coupling regimes
Authors: Marco Valentini, Rubén Seoane Souto, Maksim Borovkov, Peter Krogstrup, Yigal Meir, Martin Leijnse, Jeroen Danon, Georgios Katsaros
Abstract: Superconductor--semiconductor hybrid systems play a crucial role in realizing nanoscale quantum devices, including hybrid qubits, Majorana bound states, and Kitaev chains. For such hybrid devices, subgap states play a prominent role in their operation. In this work, we study such subgap states via Coulomb and tunneling spectroscopy through a superconducting island defined in a semiconductor nanowire fully coated by a superconductor. We systematically explore regimes ranging from an almost decoupled island to the open configuration. In the weak coupling regime, the experimental observations are very similar in the absence of a magnetic field and when one flux quantum is piercing the superconducting shell. Conversely, in the strong coupling regime, significant distinctions emerge between the two cases. We ascribe this different behavior to the existence of subgap states at one flux quantum, which become observable only for sufficiently strong coupling to the leads. We support our interpretation using a simple model to describe transport through the island. Our study highlights the importance of studying a broad range of tunnel couplings for understanding the rich physics of hybrid devices.

Title: Entanglement scaling behaviors of free fermions on hyperbolic lattices
Authors: Xiang-You Huang, Yao Zhou, Peng Ye
Abstract: Recently, tight-binding models on hyperbolic lattices (discretized AdS space) have gained significant attention, leading to hyperbolic band theory and non-Abelian Bloch states. In this paper, we investigate these quantum systems from the perspective of quantum information, focusing particularly on the scaling of entanglement entropy (EE) that has been regarded as a powerful quantum-information probe into exotic phases of matter. It is known that on $d$-dimensional translation-invariant Euclidean lattice, the EE of band insulators scales as an area law ($\sim L^{d-1}$; $L$ is the linear size of the boundary between two subsystems). Meanwhile, the EE of metals (with finite Density-of-State, i.e., DOS) scales as the renowned Gioev-Klich-Widom scaling law ($\sim L^{d-1}\log L$). The appearance of logarithmic divergence, as well as the analytic form of the coefficient $c$ is mathematically controlled by the Widom conjecture of asymptotic behavior of Toeplitz matrices and can be physically understood via the Swingle's argument. However, the hyperbolic lattice, which generalizes translational symmetry, results in inapplicability of these analytic approaches and the potential non-trivial behavior of EE. Here we make an initial attempt through numerical simulation. Remarkably, we find that both cases adhere to the area law, indicating the effect of background hyperbolic geometry that influences quantum entanglement. To achieve the results, we first apply the vertex inflation method to generate hyperbolic lattice on the Poincaré disk, and then apply the Haydock recursion method to compute DOS. Finally, we study the scaling of EE for different bipartitions via exact diagonalization and perform finite-size scaling. We also investigate how the coefficient of the area law is correlated to bulk gap in gapped case and to the DOS in gapless case respectively. Future directions are discussed.

Title: Superconductivity and quantized anomalous Hall in rhombohedral graphene
Authors: Youngjoon Choi, Ysun Choi, Marco Valentini, Caitlin L. Patterson, Ludwig F. W. Holleis, Owen I. Sheekey, Hari Stoyanov, Xiang Cheng, Takashi Taniguchi, Kenji Watanabe, Andrea F. Young
Abstract: Inducing superconducting correlations in chiral edge states is predicted to generate topologically protected zero energy modes with exotic quantum statistics. Experimental efforts to date have focused on engineering interfaces between superconducting materials typically amorphous metals and semiconducting quantum Hall or quantum anomalous Hall (QAH) systems. However, the interfacial disorder inherent in this approach can prevent the formation of isolated topological modes. An appealing alternative is to use low-density flat band materials where the ground state can be tuned between intrinsic superconducting and quantum anomalous Hall states using only the electric field effect. However, quantized transport and superconductivity have not been simultaneously achieved. Here, we show that rhombohedral tetralayer graphene aligned to a hexagonal boron nitride substrate hosts a quantized anomalous Hall state at superlattice filling $\nu=-1$ as well as a superconducting state at $\nu-3.5$ at zero magnetic field. Remarkably, gate voltage can also be used to actuate nonvolatile switching of the chirality in the quantum anomalous Hall state, allowing, in principle, arbitrarily reconfigurable networks of topological edge modes in locally gated devices. Thermodynamic compressibility measurements further reveal a topologically ordered fractional Chern insulator at $\nu=2/3$-also stable at zero magnetic field-enabling proximity coupling between superconductivity and fractionally charged edge modes. Finally, we show that, as in rhombohedral bi- and trilayers, integrating a transition metal dichalcogenide layer to the heterostructure nucleates a new superconducting pocket, while leaving the topology of the $\nu=-1$ quantum anomalous Hall state intact. Our results pave the way for a new generation of hybrid interfaces between superconductors and topological edge states in the low-disorder limit.

Title: Efficient and systematic calculation of arbitrary observables for the matrix product state excitation ansatz
Authors: Jesse J. Osborne, Ian P. McCulloch
Abstract: Numerical methods based on matrix product states (MPSs) are currently the de facto standard for calculating the ground-state properties of (quasi-)one-dimensional quantum many-body systems. While the properties of the low-lying excitations in such systems are often studied in this MPS framework through _dynamics_ by means of time-evolution simulations, we can also look at their _statics_ by directly calculating eigenstates corresponding to these excitations. The so-called MPS excitation ansatz is a powerful method for finding such eigenstates with a single-particle character in the thermodynamic limit. Although this excitation ansatz has been used quite extensively, a general method for calculating expectation values for these states is lacking in the literature: we aim to fill this gap by presenting a recursive algorithm to calculate arbitrary observables expressed as matrix product operators. This method concisely encapsulates existing methods for -- as well as extensions to -- the excitation ansatz, such as excitations with a larger spatial support and multi-particle excitations, and is robust enough to handle further innovations. We demonstrate the versatility of our method by studying the low-lying excitations in the spin-1 Heisenberg chain and the one-dimensional Hubbard model, looking at how the excitations converge in the former, while in the latter, we present a refined method of targeting single-particle excitations inside a continuum by minimizing the energy _variance_ rather than the energy itself. We hope that this technique will foster further advancements with the excitation ansatz.

Title: Berry Phase Enforced Spinor Pairing Order
Authors: Yi Li, Grayson R. Frazier
Abstract: We introduce a class of topological pairing orders characterized by a half-integer pair monopole charge, leading to Berry phase enforced half-integer partial wave symmetry. This exotic spinor order emerges from pairing between Fermi surfaces with Chern numbers differing by an odd integer. Using tight-binding models, we demonstrate spinor superconducting orders with monopole charges $\pm 1/2$, featuring a single gap node and nontrivial surface states. Additionally, the superfluid velocity follows a fractionalized Mermin-Ho relation in spatially inhomogeneous pairing orders. The concept extends to spinor density waves and excitons.

Title: OmniXAS: A Universal Deep-Learning Framework for Materials X-ray Absorption Spectra
Authors: Shubha R. Kharel, Fanchen Meng, Xiaohui Qu, Matthew R. Carbone, Deyu Lu
Abstract: X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) is a powerful characterization technique for probing the local chemical environment of absorbing atoms. However, analyzing XAS data presents significant challenges, often requiring extensive, computationally intensive simulations, as well as significant domain expertise. These limitations hinder the development of fast, robust XAS analysis pipelines that are essential in high-throughput studies and for autonomous experimentation. We address these challenges with OmniXAS, a framework that contains a suite of transfer learning approaches for XAS prediction, each contributing to improved accuracy and efficiency, as demonstrated on K-edge spectra database covering eight 3d transition metals (Ti-Cu). The OmniXAS framework is built upon three distinct strategies. First, we use M3GNet to derive latent representations of the local chemical environment of absorption sites as input for XAS prediction, achieving up to order-of-magnitude improvements over conventional featurization techniques. Second, we employ a hierarchical transfer learning strategy, training a universal multi-task model across elements before fine-tuning for element-specific predictions. Models based on this cascaded approach after element-wise fine-tuning outperform element-specific models by up to 69%. Third, we implement cross-fidelity transfer learning, adapting a universal model to predict spectra generated by simulation of a different fidelity with a higher computational cost. This approach improves prediction accuracy by up to 11% over models trained on the target fidelity alone. Our approach boosts the throughput of XAS modeling by orders of magnitude versus first-principles simulations and is extendable to XAS prediction for a broader range of elements. This transfer learning framework is generalizable to enhance deep-learning models that target other properties in materials research.

Title: Field theory of monitored, interacting fermion dynamics with charge conservation
Authors: Haoyu Guo, Matthew S. Foster, Chao-Ming Jian, Andreas W. W. Ludwig
Abstract: Measurement-induced phase transitions (MIPTs) in monitored quantum dynamics are non-equilibrium phase transitions between quantum-chaotic (volume-law entangled) and entanglement-suppressed, area-law phases. We reveal how monitored dynamics are situated within the framework of general far-from-equilibrium, quantum condensed-matter physics. Measurement-induced heating effects scramble the distribution function in generic (interacting) monitored fermion systems, which enables a simplified symmetry-based description of the dynamics. We demonstrate the equivalence of the Keldysh technique with the conventional Statistical-Mechanics Model for circuits, resulting from a doubled Hilbert-space (Choi-Jamiołkowski) mapping. We illustrate this using the monitored dynamics of interacting fermions with a conserved charge, deriving a unified effective field theory that captures all phases and phase transitions. The non-interacting counterpart in 1D space only has an area-law phase, with no MIPT. This was explained via an effective non-linear sigma model replica field theory possessing a very large symmetry. We show that other phases and phase transitions emerge when the replica symmetry is reduced by interactions. The reduced symmetry combines a replica permutation symmetry and charge-conservation within each replica. The former and its spontaneous breaking govern the MIPT, which can be recognized via a separatrix in the renormalization group flow. The replica-resolved charge conservation dictates the ``charge-sharpening" transition between two kinds of dynamics, where the global charge information is either hidden or reconstructible from the measurements. The field theory explains why the charge-sharpening transition should occur only in the volume-law phase. Our framework provides a template for other classes of MIPTs and situates these within the arena of non-equilibrium condensed matter physics.

Title: KPROJ: A Program for Unfolding Electronic and Phononic Bands
Authors: Jiaxin Chen, Mingxing Chen
Abstract: We introduce a program named KPROJ that unfolds the electronic and phononic band structure of materials modeled by supercells. The program is based on the $\textit{k}$-projection method, which projects the wavefunction of the supercell onto the ${\textbf{k}}$-points in the Brillouin zone of the artificial primitive cell. It allows for obtaining an effective "local" band structure by performing partial integration over the wavefunctions, e.g., the unfolded band structure with layer-projection for interfaces and the weighted band structure in the vacuum for slabs. The layer projection is accelerated by a scheme that combines the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) and the inverse FFT algorithms. It is now interfaced with a few first-principles codes based on plane waves such as VASP, Quantum Espresso, and ABINIT. In addition, it also has interfaces with ABACUS, a first-principles simulation package based on numerical atomic basis sets, and PHONOPY, a program for phonon calculations.

Title: Terahertz electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals
Authors: A. A. Melnikov, A. A. Sokolik, Yu. G. Selivanov, S. V. Chekalin
Abstract: We report the observation of the electro-optic effect in Bi$_2$Se$_3$ crystals induced by an intense single-cycle terahertz pulse. The effect reveals itself as a transient change of the polarization state of a femtosecond laser pulse reflected from the crystal that is exposed to the terahertz electric field. The corresponding experimental signal follows the field with a sub-100-fs delay and can be represented as a linear combination of the terahertz electric field and its square. The linear and quadratic components are of comparable magnitude. The latter is almost independent of crystal orientation, while the former demonstrates three-fold rotational symmetry in agreement with the trigonal symmetry of the crystal surface. The electro-optic effect vanishes upon phase transition to the non-topological metal state induced by indium doping and also can be quenched by a femtosecond pre-pulse. We associate this effect with surface Dirac electronic states of Bi$_2$Se$_3$ and discuss its possible mechanisms.

Title: Asymptotically exact formulas for the stripe domains period in ultrathin ferromagnetic films with out-of-plane anisotropy
Authors: Anne Bernand-Mantel, Valeriy V. Slastikov, Cyrill B. Muratov
Abstract: We derive asymptotically exact formulas for the equilibrium magnetic stripe period in ultrathin films with out-of-plane anisotropy that include the full domain wall magnetic dipolar energy. Starting with the reduced two-dimensional micromagnetic model valid for thin films, we obtain the leading order approximation for the energy per unit volume in the vanishing film thickness limit in the case of Bloch and Néel wall rotations. Its minimization in the stripe period leads to an analytical expression for the equilibrium period with a prefactor proportional to the Bloch wall width. The constant in the prefactor, related to the long-range dipolar interactions, is carefully evaluated. This results in a remarkable agreement of the stripe domain energy density and stripe period predicted by our analytical formulas with micromagnetic simulations. Our formula can be used to accurately deduce magnetic parameters from the experimental measurements of the stripe period and to systematically predict the equilibrium stripe periods in ultrathin films.

Title: Measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases
Authors: Chen-Huan Wu
Abstract: In this article, we focus on measurement-induced physics and stochastic dynamics in the systems of single-body quasiparticle and many-body microscopic cases. In the former case, it shows a smooth evolution from a non-Gaussian (Poission or binomial distribution) with local dephasing to a Gaussian with global dephasing (quantum microscopic to classical macroscopic) where in late time there is a global symmetry that consists of exponentially many pure states due to the suppressed (stochastic) fluctuation and heating; In the latter case, it shows exponentially many distinct (Krylov) sectors due to the fragmentation and dynamical constrain on Hilbert-space. A gapless-to-gapped transition ((sub)volume law to area-law) during evolution is evident for the former case, where, however, the asymptotic approaching area-law scaling (system-size-independence) even appears in early time with the increasing system-size toward infinity. A novel purifying lasting for a short time is found in the early stage of the former case, during which there is long-range power law decay and scrambling before the Lieb-Robinson bound. Meanwhile, in the latter case, local non-Gaussian interactions (with a large power-law exponent) are present, maintaining an invariant gapless feature. Except a comprehensive study for the both cases, our scheme avoid the interaction effect as well as the selections on measured states due to the measurement apparatus, and thus easier evaluatin on the expectations of non-Hermitian observables

Title: Predicting ionic conductivity in solids from the machine-learned potential energy landscape
Authors: Artem Maevskiy, Alexandra Carvalho, Emil Sataev, Volha Turchyna, Keian Noori, Aleksandr Rodin, A. H. Castro Neto, Andrey Ustyuzhanin
Abstract: Discovering new superionic materials is essential for advancing solid-state batteries, which offer improved energy density and safety compared to the traditional lithium-ion batteries with liquid electrolytes. Conventional computational methods for identifying such materials are resource-intensive and not easily scalable. Recently, universal interatomic potential models have been developed using equivariant graph neural networks. These models are trained on extensive datasets of first-principles force and energy calculations. One can achieve significant computational advantages by leveraging them as the foundation for traditional methods of assessing the ionic conductivity, such as molecular dynamics or nudged elastic band techniques. However, the generalization error from model inference on diverse atomic structures arising in such calculations can compromise the reliability of the results. In this work, we propose an approach for the quick and reliable screening of ionic conductors through the analysis of a universal interatomic potential. Our method incorporates a set of heuristic structure descriptors that effectively employ the rich knowledge of the underlying model while requiring minimal generalization capabilities. Using our descriptors, we rank lithium-containing materials in the Materials Project database according to their expected ionic conductivity. Eight out of the ten highest-ranked materials are confirmed to be superionic at room temperature in first-principles calculations. Notably, our method achieves a speed-up factor of approximately 50 compared to molecular dynamics driven by a machine-learning potential, and is at least 3,000 times faster compared to first-principles molecular dynamics.

Title: Phase diagram of the disordered Kitaev chain with long range pairing connected to external baths
Authors: Emmanuele G. Cinnirella, Andrea Nava, Gabriele Campagnano, Domenico Giuliano
Abstract: We study the phase diagram of a disordered Kitaev chain with long-range pairing when connected to two metallic leads exchanging particles with external Lindblad baths. We (i) monitor the subgap modes at increasing disorder, (ii) compute the current flowing across the system at a finite voltage bias between the baths, and (iii) study the normal single particle lead correlations across the chain. Throughout our derivation, we evidence the interplay between disorder and topology. In particular, we evidence the reentrant behavior of the massive, topological phase at limited values of the disorder strength, similar to what happens in the short-range pairing Kitaev model. Our results suggest the possibility of a disorder-induced direct transition between the massive and the short-range topological phase of the long-range pairing Kitaev model.

Title: Geometric dependence of curvature-induced rigidity
Authors: Hanzhang Mao, Thomas G. J. Chandler, Mark Han, Saverio E. Spagnolie
Abstract: Bending the edge of a thin elastic material promotes rigidity far from its clamped boundary. However, this curvature-induced rigidity can be overwhelmed by gravity or other external loading, resulting in elastic buckling and large deformations. We consider the role of body geometry on this competition using experiments, numerical simulations, and reduced-order models. Finite element simulations are performed using a model nonlinear hyperelastic material, and a theoretical framework is proposed that incorporates small lateral curvatures, large longitudinal rotations, and a varying cross-sectional width. A particular focus is on the comparison between rectangular and triangular sheets, and trapezoidal sheets in between. Sheet geometry affects downward tip deflection by changing the relative importance of the sheet's weight and the rigidity provided by curvature, often in subtle ways. In extreme cases, non-monotonic deflection is observed with increasing sheet length, and a region of hysteretic bistability emerges, becoming more pronounced with rectangular sheets and large imposed curvatures. These findings demonstrate the profound impact of geometry on the competition between curvature-induced rigidity and gravity-induced deformation in thin elastic materials.

Title: Enhanced nonlinear Hall effect by Cooper pairs near superconductor criticality
Authors: Zi-Hao Dong, Hui Yang, Yi Zhang
Abstract: Unlike the linear Hall effect that requires broken time-reversal symmetry, the nonlinear Hall effect may occur in time-reversal symmetric systems as long as there exists a non-zero Berry curvature dipole in the absence of inversion symmetry. Interestingly, the presence of time-reversal symmetry is consistent with and thus allows a direct transition into a superconducting phase. Indeed, superconductivity has been established in various nonlinear Hall materials, such as WTe$_2$ and MoTe$_2$, at sufficiently low temperatures. We find that the nonlinear Hall response should be significantly enhanced near the superconducting criticality, dominated by the Aslamazov-Larkin (AL) contributions augmented by superconducting fluctuations, which we attribute to the Berry curvature dipole and a divergent lifetime $\tau\sim (T-T_c)^{-1}$ of the Cooper pairs, instead of the single electrons. Such a controlled enhancement brings the nonlinear Hall effect into various simple experimental observations and practical applicational potentials.

Title: Colloidal structure, energy extensivity and Monte Carlo sampling properties of improved short-range interaction models for surfactant-coated magnetic nanoparticles
Authors: Aimê Gomes da Mata Kanzaki, Tiago de Sousa Araújo Cassiano, João Valeriano, Fabio Luis de Oliveira Paula, Leonardo Luiz e Castro
Abstract: The standard DLVO theory offers a limited description of ionic-surfacted magnetic colloids in near aggregation regimes. Correcting the electrical double layer term for ionic surfactants is not enough to successfully simulate the systems. The correction of the van der Waals energy divergence at short interparticle distances is fundamental for proper Monte Carlo sampling of nanoparticles' configurations. We compare different short-range interaction models and show that a more detailed model leads to Monte Carlo simulations that better match theoretical expectations. Studying the energy scaling with the number of particles, we observe a slight deviation from energy extensivity across all models, small but still detectable via Akaike's information criterion. The more detailed model predicts a strong effect of particle-size dispersity on the transition between overall attraction and repulsion. More precise modeling can significantly affect numerical predictions, in particular, the effect of particle-size dispersity on the spatial structure of colloids with high volume fraction. This emphasizes the importance of nailing down better models for describing complex colloidal dispersions.

Title: Emergent facilitation by random constraints in a facilitated random walk model of glass
Authors: Leo S.I. Lam, Hai-Yao Deng, Wei-Bing Zhang, Udoka Nwankwo, Chu Xiao, Cho-Tung Yip, Chun-Shing Lee, Haihui Ruan, Chi-Hang Lam
Abstract: The physics of glass has been a significant topic of interest for decades. Dynamical facilitation is widely believed to be an important characteristic of glassy dynamics, but the precise mechanism is still under debate. We propose a lattice model of glass called the facilitated random walk (FRW). Each particle performs continuous time random walk in the presence of its own random local kinetic constraints. The particles do not interact energetically. Instead, they interact kinetically with a hopping rate resampling rule under which motions of a particle can randomly perturb the local kinetic constraints of other particles. This dynamic interaction is reversible, following a rate restoration rule. A step-by-step reversal of the particle motions exactly restore the previous constraints, modeling randomness quenched in the configuration space of glass. The model exhibits stretched exponential relaxation and dynamical heterogeneity typical of glasses. Despite the lack of explicit facilitation rule, the FRW shows facilitation behaviors closely analogous to those of the kinetically constrained models (KCM). The FRW is a coarse-grained version of the distinguishable particle lattice model (DPLM) and this exemplifies that compatible defect and atomistic models can complement each other on the study of glass.

Title: Recurrence method in Non-Hermitian Systems
Authors: Haoyan Chen, Yi Zhang
Abstract: We propose a novel and systematic recurrence method for the energy spectra of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions based on the recurrence relations of their characteristic polynomials. Our formalism exhibits better accuracy and performance on multi-band non-Hermitian systems than numerical diagonalization or the non-Bloch band theory. It also provides a targeted and efficient formulation for the non-Hermitian edge spectra. As demonstrations, we derive general expressions for both the bulk and edge spectra of multi-band non-Hermitian models with nearest-neighbor hopping and under open boundary conditions, such as the non-Hermitian Su-Schrieffer-Heeger and Rice-Mele models and the non-Hermitian Hofstadter butterfly - 2D lattice models in the presence of non-reciprocity and perpendicular magnetic fields, which is only made possible by the significantly lower complexity of the recurrence method. In addition, we use the recurrence method to study non-Hermitian edge physics, including the size-parity effect and the stability of the topological edge modes against boundary perturbations. Our recurrence method offers a novel and favorable formalism to the intriguing physics of non-Hermitian systems under open boundary conditions.

Title: Nonreciprocal ballistic transport in multi-layer Weyl Semimetal films with surface engineering
Authors: M. H. Zou, H. Geng, R. Ma, W. Chen, L. Sheng, D. Y. Xing
Abstract: Weyl semimetal (WSM) thin films exhibit distinct electronic properties compared to their bulk counterparts. In this study, we theoretically investigate the nonreciprocal ballistic transport phenomena arising in WSM thin films due to surface modifications. Our analysis demonstrates that the nonreciprocity is sub-band-resolved, where the surface states provide the dominant contribution to the nonreciprocity, whereas the bulk states introduce a negative correction. Calculations further reveal a quantum size effect: overall, the nonreciprocal signal decreases with increasing film thickness, but it undergoes discontinuities as the Fermi energy approaches the bottom of a sub-band. Moreover, we observe that the density of states (DOS) in such multi-layer systems exhibits a thickness-independent pattern, which can be effectively explained by a single-variable theory.

Title: High-Magnetic Field Phases in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$
Authors: Camilla M. Moir, John Singleton, Joanna Blawat, Eric Lee-Wong, Yuhang Deng, Keke Feng, Tyler Wannamaker, Ryan E. Baumbach, M. Brian Maple
Abstract: At temperatures much lower than its superconducting critical temperature $T_c$ of 2.1 K, the heavy fermion superconductor UTe$_2$ has a remarkable phase diagram of magnetic field $H$ vs. angles $\phi$ and $\theta$ at which $H$ is tilted away from the $b$-axis toward the $a$- and $c$-axes, respectively, in the orthorhombic unit cell. The phase diagram appears to contain three superconducting phases: (1) a low field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ extending over all values of $\phi$ and $\theta$ with an upper critical field $H_{c2}$ with a maximum value of 15 T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$; (2) a high field superconducting phase SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ located in a region between $\phi \approx 7^\circ$ and $\theta \approx 4^\circ$ in fields from $H_{c2\mathrm{LF}}$ of the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase and the metamagnetic transition at $H_m$ at $\sim 35$ T marking the onset of the magnetic field polarized FP phase: and (3) a SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ superconducting phase that resides entirely within the FP phase in a pocket of superconductivity extending from $\theta \approx 20^\circ$ to $40^\circ$ in fields from $\sim 40$ T to above 60 T. In this work, we studied the $H$ vs $\theta$ phase diagram at a base temperature of $\sim 0.6$ K as a function of Th concentration $x$ in U$_{1-x}$Th$_x$Te$_2$ pseudobinary compounds for $0.5\% \lesssim x \lesssim 4.7\%$. We find that for all values of $x$ within this range, the SC$_{\mathrm{LF}}$ phase is retained with a reduced value of $H_{c2}$ of $\sim 10$ T at $\phi = \theta = 0^\circ$ for $x = 4.7\%$, while the SC$_{\mathrm{HF}}$ phase is suppressed. The SC$_{\mathrm{FP}}$ and FP phases are unaffected to values of $x = 2\%$ but are completely suppressed in the region $x = 2.5$ to $4.7\%$ where the residual resistance ratio RRR has decreased from $\sim 14$ at $x = 1.5\%$ to values of $\sim 3$, indicating a significant increase in disorder.

Title: Magnetic-field effect on excitonic condensation emergent in extended Falicov-Kimball model
Authors: Naoya Ohta, Joji Nasu
Abstract: We investigate the effects of magnetic fields on excitonic condensation in the extended Falicov-Kimball model, which is a spinless two-orbital Hubbard model with orbital splitting. In lattice systems under magnetic fields up to several tens of teslas, Zeeman effects on electron spins have been extensively studied, while the impact on orbital motion has often been considered negligible. However, the recent capability to generate ultra-high magnetic fields exceeding 1000 T has renewed interest in understanding their influence on ordered phases in correlated electron systems, beyond spin-related phenomena. To examine these effects, we incorporate a magnetic field into the extended Falicov-Kimball model by introducing the Peierls phase into the transfer integrals, enabling the study of orbital motion. Using the Hartree-Fock approximation, we reveal a nonmonotonic response of the excitonic order parameter to increasing magnetic fields. At sufficiently high fields, the excitonic order is suppressed, resulting in a disordered insulating state characterized by partial occupation of the two orbitals with nonzero Chern numbers. This state is distinct from a fully orbital-polarized configuration. Furthermore, our analysis of an excitonic supersolid phase, in which excitonic and orbital orders coexist, demonstrates that orbital order remains robust under magnetic fields, while excitonic condensation is suppressed. These findings provide insights into the interplay between orbital motion and magnetic fields in multi-orbital correlated electron systems.

Title: Ferromagnetic Resonance in a Magnetically Dilute Percolating Ferromagnet: An Experimental and Theoretical Study
Authors: Y.K. Edathumkandy, K. Das, K. Gas, D. Sztenkiel, D. Hommel, H. Przybylińska, M. Sawicki
Abstract: Ferromagnetic resonance (FMR) serves as a powerful probe of magnetization dynamics and anisotropy in percolating ferromagnets, where short-range interactions govern long-range magnetic order. We apply this approach to Ga$_{1-x}$Mn$_x$N ($x \simeq 8$\%), a dilute ferromagnetic semiconductor, combining FMR and superconducting quantum interference device magnetometry. Our results confirm the percolative nature of ferromagnetism in (Ga,Mn)N, with a Curie temperature $T_{\mathrm{C}} = 12$ K, and reveal that despite magnetic dilution, key features of conventional ferromagnets are retained. FMR measurements establish a robust uniaxial anisotropy, dictated by Mn$^{3+}$ single-ion anisotropy, with an easy-plane character at low Mn content. While excessive line broadening suppresses FMR signals below 9 K, they persist up to 70~K, indicating the presence of non-percolating ferromagnetic clusters well above $T_{\mathrm{C}}$. The temperature dependence of the FMR intensity follows that of the magnetization, underscoring the stability of these clusters. We quantitatively describe both FMR and SQUID observables using atomistic spin model operating on a common set of parameters. The level of agreement, achieved without tuning parameters between datasets, demonstrates the robustness and practical applicability of the approach in capturing the essential physics of spin-diluted, percolating ferromagnets. This study advances the understanding of percolating ferromagnetic systems, demonstrating that FMR is a key technique for probing their unique dynamic and anisotropic properties. Our findings contribute to the broader exploration of dilute ferromagnets and provide new insights into percolating ferromagnetic systems, which will be relevant for spintronic opportunities.

Title: Spontaneous chirality selection and nonreciprocal spin wave in breathing-kagome antiferromagnets at zero field
Authors: Kazushi Aoyama, Hikaru Kawamura
Abstract: It has been known that the spin-wave dispersion, which is usually symmetric in the momentum space with respect to ${\bf q}=0$, can be asymmetric in the presence of the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya (DM) interaction and an applied magnetic field. Here, we theoretically demonstrate that in $J_3$-dominant classical Heisenberg antiferromagnets on the breathing kagome lattice, the asymmetric spin-wave dispersion appears in a chiral phase due to non-uniform geometric phases acquired in the spin-wave propagation processes. This points to the emergence of a nonreciprocal spin wave in the absence of both the DM interaction and the magnetic field. Reflecting the asymmetry, positive-spin-chirality and negative-spin-chirality states, either one of which is selected in the low-temperature phase by the symmetry breaking, show different spin-wave dispersions, suggesting that the two energetically-degenerate chiral states can be distinguished by the spin-wave propagation.

Title: High-Velocity Magnetic Domain Wall Motion Driven by Acoustic Spin Transfer Torque
Authors: Jiacheng Lu, Fa Chen, Yiming Shu, Yukang Wen, Hang Zou, Yuhao Liu, Shiheng Liang, Wei Luo, Yue Zhang
Abstract: We predict high-velocity magnetic domain wall (DW) motion driven by out-of-plane acoustic spin in surface acoustic waves (SAWs). We demonstrate that the SAW propagating at a 30-degree angle relative to the x-axis of a 128-degree Y-LiNbO3 substrate exhibits uniform out-of-plane spin angular momentum. This acoustic spin triggers the DW motion at a velocity exceeding 50 m/s in a way that is similar to the spin-transfer-torque (STT) effect. This phenomenon highlights the potential of acoustic spin in enabling rapid DW displacement, offering an innovative approach to developing energy-efficient spintronic devices.

Title: Backscattering in Topological Edge States Despite Time-Reversal Symmetry
Authors: Jonas Erhardt, Mattia Iannetti, Fernando Dominguez, Ewelina M. Hankiewicz, Björn Trauzettel, Gianni Profeta, Domenico Di Sante, Giorgio Sangiovanni, Simon Moser, Ralph Claessen
Abstract: Spin-momentum-locked edge states of quantum spin Hall insulators (QSHIs) provide a compelling platform for spintronic applications, owing to their intrinsic protection against backscattering from non-magnetic disorder. This protection emerges from time-reversal symmetry, which pairs Kramers partners of helical edge modes with opposite spin and momentum, thereby strictly forbidding elastic single-particle backscattering within the pair. Yet, contrary to the idealized notion of linear edge bands, the non-monotonic dispersions of realistic materials can host multiple Kramers pairs, reintroducing backscattering channels between them without violating time-reversal symmetry. Here, we investigate inter-Kramers pair backscattering in the non-linear edge bands of the QSHI indenene, highlighting a critical aspect of edge-state stability. Using quasiparticle interference in scanning tunneling spectroscopy -- a direct probe of backscattering -- we observe pairwise coupling between energy-degenerate Kramers pairs, while energy regions with only a single Kramers pair remain strictly protected. Supported by theoretical analysis, our findings provide an unprecedented experimental demonstration of edge state backscattering fully consistent with their underlying topological protection. This insight has profound implications for numerous QSHI candidates, emphasizing that the mere presence of gap-traversing edge modes does not inherently guarantee their protection against backscattering.

Title: Giant spin shift current in two-dimensional altermagnetic multiferroics VOX$\mathrm{_2}$
Authors: Yao Yang, Jinxiong Jia, Longjun Xiang, Fuming Xu, Hao Jin
Abstract: Altermagnets, which exhibit spin-split electronic bands without net magnetization, provide an appealing platform for exploring unconventional spin and ferroic physics. Through symmetry analyses and first-principles calculations, we show that monolayer \(\mathrm{VOX_2}\) (\(\mathrm{X = Cl, Br, I}\)) is a two-dimensional (2D) ferroelectric altermagnet (FEAM). The spin splitting in its electronic band structure can be precisely tuned by ferroelectric polarization and magnetic order, accompanied by a giant magnetoelectric coupling coefficient. Owing to the absence of inversion symmetry, this material also exhibits pronounced nonlinear optical responses. The altermagnetic \(\mathrm{VOI_2}\) monolayer show an exceptionally large spin shift current of up to \(330.072\,\mu\mathrm{A}/\mathrm{V}^2\), which is switchable by reversing the magnetic order. These results uncover a strong interplay between magnetic and ferroelectric orders, offering a route toward electrically and magnetically tunable nonlinear spin photocurrents in 2D multiferroic systems.

Abstract: In kagome metals, flat electronic bands induced by frustrated hopping are a platform for strong electron correlations. In particular, a selective coupling of flat band states to certain kagome phonon modes is proposed as a universal origin of superconductivity in this material class. Here, we investigate the superconductivity in the kagome system LaRu$_3$(Si$_{1-x}$Ge$_x$)$_2$ by chemical pressure tuning while preserving the Ru-$4d$ states that constitute the kagome flat bands. We observe a sizable enhancement in the density of states up to $x = 0.07$, as determined by the specific heat, with a concomitant increase in the superconducting transition temperature $T_\mathrm{c}$. Ge-dopants induce a uniaxial lattice expansion along the $c$-axis. Our first-principles calculations suggest that this mitigates the detrimental effect of hybridization between kagome layers and reduces the dispersion of the Ru-$4d_{x^2-y^2}$ flat band. The calculated chemical potential moves closer to the maximum in the energy-dependent density of states. Our result is consistent with a theoretical prediction of tunable flat band superconductivity in LaRu$_3$Si$_2$ by mode-selective coupling between specific kagome phonons and the Ru-$d_{x^2-y^2}$ orbitals.

Title: Partition function zeros of quantum many-body systems
Authors: B Sriram Shastry
Abstract: We present a method for calculating the Yang-Lee partition function zeros of a translationally invariant model of lattice fermions, exemplified by the Hubbard model. The method rests on a theorem involving the single electron self-energy $\Sigma_\sigma(k, i \omega_n)$ in the imaginary time Matsubara formulation. The theorem maps the Yang-Lee zeros to a set of wavevector and spin labeled virtual energies $\xi_{k \sigma}$. These, thermodynamically derived virtual energies, are solutions of equations involving the self-energy at corresponding $k\sigma$'s. Examples of the method in simplified situations are provided.

Abstract: Triggered by the development of exfoliation and the identification of a wide range of extraordinary physical properties in self-standing films consisting of one or few atomic layers, two-dimensional (2D) materials such as graphene, transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs), and other van der Waals (vdW) crystals currently constitute a wide research field protruding in multiple directions in combination with layer stacking and twisting, nanofabrication, surface-science methods, and integration into nanostructured environments. Photonics encompasses a multidisciplinary collection of those directions, where 2D materials contribute with polaritons of unique characteristics such as strong spatial confinement, large optical-field enhancement, long lifetimes, high sensitivity to external stimuli (e.g., electric and magnetic fields, heating, and strain), a broad spectral range from the far infrared to the ultraviolet, and hybridization with spin and momentum textures of electronic band structures. The explosion of photonics with 2D materials as a vibrant research area is producing breakthroughs, including the discovery and design of new materials and metasurfaces with unprecedented properties as well as applications in integrated photonics, light emission, optical sensing, and exciting prospects for applications in quantum information, and nanoscale thermal transport. This Roadmap summarizes the state of the art in the field, identifies challenges and opportunities, and discusses future goals and how to meet them through a wide collection of topical sections prepared by leading practitioners.

Title: Timescales for thermalization, quantum chaos, and self-averaging
Authors: Isaías Vallejo-Fabila, Lea F. Santos
Abstract: This chapter discusses the conditions and timescales under which isolated many-body quantum systems, initially far from equilibrium, ultimately reach thermal equilibrium. We also examine quantities that, during the relaxation process, exhibit dynamical manifestations of spectral correlations as in random matrix theory and investigate how these manifestations affect their equilibration times. We refer to systems presenting these spectral correlations as chaotic quantum systems, although the correct term to be employed, whether chaotic or ergodic quantum systems, is debatable and both have limitations.

Title: Two-dimensional perovskites with maximum symmetry enable exciton diffusion length exceeding 2 micrometers

Abstract: Realizing semiconductors with high symmetry of their crystallographic structures has been a virtue of inorganic materials and has resulted in novel physical behaviors. In contrast, hybrid (organic and inorganic) crystals such as two-dimensional metal halide perovskites exhibit much lower crystal symmetry due to in-plane or out of plane octahedral distortions. Despite their amazing ability for photoinduced light emission at room temperature, the Achilles' heel of this attractive class of 2D materials for optoelectronics remains the poor control and lack of performance for charge carrier transport. Inspired by the tremendous charge carrier properties of the 3D cubic perovskite phase of FAPbI3 and combining the use of the appropriate cage cation, the spacer molecule and the temperature and rate of crystallization, we report a new series of FA-based layered two-dimensional perovskites that exhibits the highest theoretically predicted symmetry with a tetragonal P4/mmm space group, resulting in no octahedral distortion in both in-plane and out-of-plane directions. These 2D perovskites present the shortest interlayer distances (4 angstrom), which results in systematically lower bandgaps (1.7 to 1.8 eV). Finally, the absence of octahedral distortions, results in an exciton diffusion length of 2.5 {\mu}m, and a diffusivity of 4.4 cm2s-1, both of which are an order of magnitude larger compared to previously reported 2D perovskites and on par with monolayer transition metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Design of altermagnetic models from spin clusters
Authors: Xingchuan Zhu, Xingmin Huo, Shiping Feng, Song-Bo Zhang, Shengyuan A. Yang, Huaiming Guo
Abstract: Altermagnetism, a new class of collinear compensated magnetic phase, has garnered tremendous interest because of its rich physics and promising applications. Physical models and verified material candidates for altermagnetism remain limited. Here, we propose a general scheme to construct altermagnetic models, which explicitly exhibits the blend of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic correlations in real space via the design of spin clusters, echoing the observation that properties of altermagnets resemble a mixture of ferromagnets and antiferromagnets. We show that in some of our models, the desired altermagnetic order can be spontaneously realized by electron-electron interaction in a broad range of the phase diagram. This development facilitates the study of fascinating physics of altermagnetism and sheds light on the discovery of new altermagnetic materials.

Title: Maximum entropy modeling of Optimal Transport: the sub-optimality regime and the transition from dense to sparse networks
Authors: Lorenzo Buffa, Dario Mazzilli, Riccardo Piombo, Fabio Saracco, Giulio Cimini, Aurelio Patelli
Abstract: We present a bipartite network model that captures intermediate stages of optimization by blending the Maximum Entropy approach with Optimal Transport. In this framework, the network's constraints define the total mass each node can supply or receive, while an external cost field favors a minimal set of links, driving the system toward a sparse, tree-like structure. By tuning the control parameter, one transitions from uniformly distributed weights to an optimal transport regime in which weights condense onto cost-favorable edges. We quantify this dense-to-sparse transition, showing with numerical analyses that the process does not hinge on specific assumptions about the node-strength or cost distributions. Finite-size analysis confirms that the results persist in the thermodynamic limit. Because the model offers explicit control over the degree of sub-optimality, this approach lends to practical applications in link prediction, network reconstruction, and statistical validation, particularly in systems where partial optimization coexists with other noise-like factors.

Title: A relativistic non-perturbative local model of fractons and its non-local perturbative hidden sector
Authors: Rodrigo F. Sobreiro
Abstract: We construct, from first principles, a covariant local model for scalar fractonic matter coupled to a symmetric tensor gauge field. The free gauge field action is just the one of the Blasi-Maggiore model. The scalar sector, describing fracton charges, is a non-trivial covariant generalization of Pretko's quartic model. Because the model has no quadratic term in the scalar field, a direct perturbative treatment fails. Remarkably, by performing a suitable change of variables, we demonstrate that the action can be driven to a perturbative effective action. However, at the price of carrying non-local interacting terms. We study the perturbative regime of the model first by analyzing the classical field equations and some possible simple solutions, which are in accordance with the expected immobile behavior of fractons. We also derive the fracton dispersion relation and, by playing with the parameters of the model, show that there are at least six distinct phases: one with two massive fractonic modes, one of them being tachyonic; one with massless states associated with a long-range attractive potential; a mixed phase with one massive and one massless state; another one where physical states of the scalar field cannot occur at all in the physical spectrum; a massive phase with states of two different masses; and second phase where the scalar field cannot be associated with physical particles, in spite of its mass being real. Moreover, we find evidence that fractonic bound states emerge in the model for some of these phases.

Title: Theory of active self-organization of dense nematic structures in the actin cytoskeleton
Authors: Waleed Mirza, Marco De Corato, Marco Pensalfini, Guillermo Vilanova, Alejandro Torres-Sánchez, Marino Arroyo
Abstract: The actin cytoskeleton is remarkably adaptable and multifunctional. It often organizes into nematic bundles such as contractile rings or stress fibers. However, how a uniform and isotropic actin gel self-organizes into dense nematic bundles is not fully understood. Here, using an active gel model accounting for nematic order and density variations, we identify an active patterning mechanism leading to localized dense nematic structures. Linear stability analysis and nonlinear finite element simulations establish the conditions for nematic bundle self-assembly and how active gel parameters control the architecture, orientation, connectivity and dynamics of self-organized patterns. Finally, we substantiate with discrete network simulations the main requirements for nematic bundle formation according to our theory, namely increased active tension perpendicular to the nematic direction and generalized active forces conjugate to nematic order. Our work portrays actin gels a reconfigurable active materials with a spontaneous tendency to develop patterns of dense nematic bundles.

Title: Enhanced Superconductivity at a Corner for the Linear BCS Equation
Authors: Barbara Roos, Robert Seiringer
Abstract: We consider the critical temperature for superconductivity, defined via the linear BCS equation. We prove that at weak coupling the critical temperature for a sample confined to a quadrant in two dimensions is strictly larger than the one for a half-space, which in turn is strictly larger than the one for $\mathbb{R}^2$. Furthermore, we prove that the relative difference of the critical temperatures vanishes in the weak coupling limit.

Title: Monolithic Integration of Sub-50 nm III-V Nano-Heterostructures on Si (001) for Telecom Photonics
Authors: Alisha Nanwani, Paweł Wyborski, Michael S. Seifner, Shima Kadkhodazadeh, Grzegorz Sęk, Kresten Yvind, Paweł Holewa, Elizaveta Semenova
Abstract: The demand for advanced photonics technology is increasing rapidly, fueled by the necessity for high-performance and cost-effective optical information processing systems extending into the quantum domain. Silicon, benefiting from its mature fabrication processes, stands as an ideal platform. However, its inherent indirect bandgap leads to inefficient light emission. The integration of III-V materials has been proven essential to overcome this drawback. These materials are recognized for their efficient light emission and superior bandgap engineering capabilities, making them indispensable in photonics and beyond. Here, we present the monolithic integration of small-volume III-V nanoheterostructures with silicon via selective area epitaxy in the pyramidal openings etched in (100)-oriented silicon substrate. The precise positioning of the nano-heterostructures is achieved using electron beam lithography. Our atomic resolution imaging and chemical analysis confirms the epitaxial nature of InP growth, revealing well-defined heterointerfaces. Each structure incorporates an InAsP quantum dot-like active medium, and the correlation of the growth parameters with the nanoscale structure was analyzed using advanced electron microscopy. The eight-band k.p calculations demonstrate energy level quantization in three spatial dimensions. Optical characterization shows that heterostructure emission can be engineered to cover the entire telecom wavelength range. Consequently, these InAsP/InP nano-heterostructures could serve as a gain medium for silicon-based hybrid nano-lasers and nano-LEDs and quantum light sources in the telecom wavelength range.

Title: Separable ellipsoids around multipartite states
Authors: Robin Y. Wen, Gilles Parez, Liuke Lyu, William Witczak-Krempa, Achim Kempf
Abstract: We show that, in finite dimensions, around any $m$-partite product state $\rho_{\rm prod}=\rho_1\otimes...\otimes\rho_m$, there exists an ellipsoid of separable states centered around $\rho_{\rm prod}$. This separable ellipsoid contains the separable ball proposed in previous works, and the volume of the ellipsoid is typically exponentially larger than that of the ball, due to the hierarchy of eigenvalues in typical states. We further generalize this ellipsoidal criterion to a trace formula that yields separable region around all separable states, and further study biseparability. Our criteria not only help numerical procedures to rigorously detect separability, but they also lead to a nested hierarchy of SLOCC-stable subsets that cover the separable set. We apply the procedure for separability detection to 3-qubit X states, genuinely entangled 4-qubit states mixed with noise, and the 1d transverse field Ising model at finite temperature to illustrate the power of our procedure for understanding entanglement in physical systems.

Title: Brickwall One-Loop Determinant: Spectral Statistics & Krylov Complexity
Authors: Hyun-Sik Jeong, Arnab Kundu, Juan F. Pedraza
Abstract: We investigate quantum chaotic features of the brickwall model, which is obtained by introducing a stretched horizon - a Dirichlet wall placed outside the event horizon - within the BTZ geometry. This simple yet effective model has been shown to capture key properties of quantum black holes and is motivated by the stringy fuzzball proposal. We analyze the dynamics of both scalar and fermionic probe fields, deriving their normal mode spectra with Gaussian-distributed boundary conditions on the stretched horizon. By interpreting these normal modes as energy eigenvalues, we examine spectral statistics, including level spacing distributions, the spectral form factor, and Krylov state complexity as diagnostics for quantum chaos. Our results show that the brickwall model exhibits features consistent with random matrix theory across various ensembles as the standard deviation of the Gaussian distribution is varied. Specifically, we observe Wigner-Dyson distributions, a linear ramp in the spectral form factor, and a characteristic peak in Krylov complexity, all without the need for a classical interior geometry. We also demonstrate that non-vanishing spectral rigidity alone is sufficient to produce a peak in Krylov complexity, without requiring Wigner-Dyson level repulsion. Finally, we identify signatures of integrability at extreme values of the Dirichlet boundary condition parameter.

Title: Multi-Length-Scale Dopants Analysis of an Image Sensor via Focused Ion Beam-Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry and Atom Probe Tomography
Authors: Bavley Guerguis, Ramya Cuduvally, Alexander Ost, Morvarid Ghorbani, Sabaa Rashid, Wilson Machado, Dan McGrath, Chris Pawlowicz, Brian Langelier, Nabil Bassim
Abstract: The following article presents a multi-length-scale characterization approach for investigating doping chemistry and spatial distributions within semiconductors, as demonstrated using a state-of-the-art CMOS image sensor. With an intricate structural layout and varying doping types/concentration levels, this device is representative of the current challenges faced in measuring dopants within confined volumes using conventional techniques. Focused ion beam-secondary ion mass spectrometry is applied to produce large-area compositional maps with a sub-20 nm resolution, while atom probe tomography is used to extract atomic-scale quantitative dopant profiles. Leveraging the complementary capabilities of the two methods, this workflow is shown to be an effective approach for resolving nano- and micro- scale dopant information, crucial for optimizing the performance and reliability of advanced semiconductor devices.

Title: Excited States of the Uniform Electron Gas
Authors: Pierre-François Loos
Abstract: The uniform electron gas (UEG) is a cornerstone of density-functional theory (DFT) and the foundation of the local-density approximation (LDA), one of the most successful approximations in DFT. In this work, we extend the concept of UEG by introducing excited-state UEGs, systems characterized by a gap at the Fermi surface created by the excitation of electrons near the Fermi level. We report closed-form expressions of the reduced kinetic and exchange energies of these excited-state UEGs as functions of the density and the gap. Additionally, we derive the leading term of the correlation energy in the high-density limit. By incorporating an additional variable representing the degree of excitation into the UEG paradigm, the present work introduces a new framework for constructing local and semi-local state-specific functionals for excited states.

Title: Boundary Time Crystals Induced by Local Dissipation and Long-Range Interactions
Authors: Zhuqing Wang, Ruochen Gao, Xiaoling Wu, Berislav Buča, Klaus Mølmer, Li You, Fan Yang
Abstract: Driven-dissipative many-body system supports nontrivial quantum phases absent in equilibrium. As a prominent example, the interplay between coherent driving and collective dissipation can lead to a dynamical quantum phase that spontaneously breaks time-translation symmetry. This so-called boundary time crystal (BTC) is fragile in the presence of local dissipation, which can easily relax the system to a stationary state. In this work, we demonstrate a robust BTC that is intrinsically induced by local dissipation. We provide extensive numerical evidences to support existence of the BTC and study its behaviors in different regimes. In particular, with decreasing interaction range, we identify a transition from classical limit cycles to quantum BTCs featuring sizable spatial correlations. Our studies significantly broaden the scope of nonequilibrium phases and shed new light on experimental search for dynamical quantum matter.

Title: Recovering the polyhedral geometry of fragments
Authors: Janos Torok, Gabor Domokos
Abstract: Not only is the geometry of rock fragments often well approximated by ideal convex polyhedra having few faces and vertices, but these numbers carry vital geophysical information on the fragmentation process. Despite their significance, the identification of the ideal polyhedron has so far been carried out through visual inspection. Here, we present an algorithm capable of performing this task in a reliable manner. The input is a 3D scan of the fragment which is essentially a triangulated polyhedron, which however has often large number of faces and vertices. Our algorithm performs a systematic simplification using the following steps: - Gaussian smoothing is performed on the spherical histogram of the 3D scans faces to identify the most important face orientations. - Planes carrying the faces of the ideal polyhedron are identified as maxima of the smoothed histogram - Polygon is reconstructed using the identified planes - Small faces are removed in a systematic manner We present two versions of the algorithm that we benchmarked the algorithm against a dataset of human measurements on 132 fragments. Beyond identifying the ideal polyhedral approximation for fragments, our method is also capable of tracing backward the shape evolution of rounded pebbles to their origins.
