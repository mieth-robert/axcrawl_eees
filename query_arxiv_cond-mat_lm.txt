Title: GPa Pressure Imaging Using Nanodiamond Quantum Sensors
Authors: Ryotaro Suda, Kenshin Uriu, Kouki Yamamoto, Misaki Sasaki, Kento Sasaki, Mari Einaga, Katsuya Shimizu, Kensuke Kobayashi
Abstract: We demonstrate wide-field optical microscopy of the pressure distribution at approximately 20 GPa in a diamond anvil cell (DAC), using nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in nanodiamonds (NDs) as quantum sensors. Pressure and non-hydrostaticity maps are obtained by fitting optically detected magnetic resonance (ODMR) spectra with models incorporating hydrostatic and uniaxial stress conditions. Two methods for introducing NDs with a pressure-transmitting medium are compared, revealing that the embedding approach affects the degree of non-hydrostaticity. This ND-based technique offers a powerful imaging platform for probing pressure-induced phenomena and is extendable to other physical quantities such as magnetic fields.

Title: "Symmetry-from-Anomaly" in Condensed Matter related Constructions
Authors: Cenke Xu
Abstract: The noninvertible axial symmetry constructed from the ABJ-anomaly has attracted enormous interest. We discuss the mechanism of "symmetry-from-anomaly" in condensed matter-related models in both 1d and 3d spaces (which correspond to (1+1)d and (3+1)d space-time). Within the models discussed here, we establish the connection between field theory quantities such as different versions of the axial charge, and quantities with simple physical meanings in our systems. In our models and likely a class of related constructions, the existence of a topological order is necessary for the purpose of properly defining the axial symmetry. But the proper axial symmetry we define, though requires a topological order, is different from the noninvertible axial symmetry discussed in recent proposals.

Title: Digital Quantum Simulation of the Kitaev Quantum Spin Liquid
Authors: Seongjun Park, Eun-Gook Moon
Abstract: The ground state of the Kitaev quantum spin liquid on a honeycomb lattice is an intriguing many-body state characterized by its topological order and massive entanglement. One of the significant issues is to prepare and manipulate the ground state as well as excited states in a quantum simulator. Here, we provide a protocol to manipulate the Kitaev quantum spin liquid via digital quantum simulation. A series of unitary gates for the protocol is explicitly constructed, showing its circuit depth is an order of $\mathcal{O}(N)$ with the number of qubits, N. We demonstrate the efficiency of our protocol on the IBM Heron r2 processor for N = 8 and 12. We further validate our theoretical framework through numerical simulations, confirming high-fidelity quantum state control for system sizes up to N = 450, and discuss the possible implications of these results.

Title: (2+1)d Lattice Models and Tensor Networks for Gapped Phases with Categorical Symmetry
Authors: Kansei Inamura, Sheng-Jie Huang, Apoorv Tiwari, Sakura Schafer-Nameki
Abstract: Gapped phases in 2+1 dimensional quantum field theories with fusion 2-categorical symmetries were recently classified and characterized using the Symmetry Topological Field Theory (SymTFT) approach arXiv:2408.05266, arXiv:2502.20440. In this paper, we provide a systematic lattice model construction for all such gapped phases. Specifically, we consider ``All boson type" fusion 2-category symmetries, all of which are obtainable from 0-form symmetry groups $G$ (possibly with an 't Hooft anomaly) via generalized gauging--that is, by stacking with an $H$-symmetric TFT and gauging a subgroup $H$. The continuum classification directly informs the lattice data, such as the generalized gauging that determines the symmetry category, and the data that specifies the gapped phase. We construct commuting projector Hamiltonians and ground states applicable to any non-chiral gapped phase with such symmetries. We also describe the ground states in terms of tensor networks. In light of the length of the paper, we include a self-contained summary section presenting the main results and examples.

Title: Zigzagging Diffusion and Non-Standard Transport in Particle-laden Nanopores Under Extreme Confinement
Authors: A. Baer, P. Malgaretti, K. Hoellring, J. Harting, Ana-Suncana Smith
Abstract: Understanding transport subject to molecular-scale confinement is key to advancing nanofluidics, yet classical hydrodynamic laws often fail at these scales. Here, we study a model system: transport of toluene as a solvent and small fullerenes as model particles confined within alumina slit nanopores using molecular dynamics simulations. We find that toluene organizes into discrete layers whose commensurability with the pore width leads to a striking, non-monotonic, zig-zag dependence of transport coefficients on confinement. This layering drives oscillations not only in solvent diffusivity but also in flow velocity and permeability under pressure-driven conditions, breaking the expected scaling relations between diffusion, viscosity, and flow. Surprisingly, introducing a nanoparticle does not wash out these effects - although the fullerene perturbs local layering, the nanoparticle diffusivity retains a zig-zag dependence on pore width. Our results demonstrate how structural commensurability and interfacial effects dominate transport in nanoconfined liquids, and lead to important deviations from continuum expectations. These findings establish a microscopic basis for size-dependent transport in nanopores and highlight the need for beyond-hydrodynamic models in confined soft matter systems.

Title: Tip-Based Proximity Ferroelectric Switching and Piezoelectric Response in Wurtzite Multilayers
Authors: Eugene A. Eliseev, Anna N. Morozovska, Sergei V. Kalinin, Long-Qing Chen, Venkatraman Gopalan
Abstract: Proximity ferroelectricity is a novel paradigm for inducing ferroelectricity, where a non-ferroelectric polar material, which is unswitchable with an external field below the dielectric breakdown field, becomes a practically switchable ferroelectric in direct contact with a thin switchable ferroelectric layer. Here, we develop a Landau-Ginzburg-Devonshire approach to study the proximity effect of local piezoelectric response and polarization reversal in wurtzite ferroelectric multilayers under a sharp electrically biased tip. Using finite element modeling we analyze the probe-induced nucleation of nanodomains, the features of local polarization hysteresis loops and coercive fields in the Al1-xScxN/AlN bilayers and three-layers. Similar to the wurtzite multilayers sandwiched between two parallel electrodes, the regimes of "proximity switching" (where the multilayers collectively switch) and the regime of "proximity suppression" (where they collectively do not switch) are the only two possible regimes in the probe-electrode geometry. However, the parameters and asymmetry of the local piezo-response and polarization hysteresis loops depend significantly on the sequence of the layers with respect to the probe. The physical mechanism of the proximity ferroelectricity in the local probe geometry is a depolarizing electric field determined by the polarization of the layers and their relative thickness. The field, whose direction is opposite to the polarization vector in the layer(s) with the larger spontaneous polarization (such as AlN), renormalizes the double-well ferroelectric potential to lower the steepness of the switching barrier in the "otherwise unswitchable" polar layers. Tip-based control of domains in otherwise non-ferroelectric layers using proximity ferroelectricity can provide nanoscale control of domain reversal in memory, actuation, sensing and optical applications.

Title: Anomalous localization of light in one-dimensional Lévy photonic lattices
Authors: Alejandro Ramírez-Yañez, Thomas Gorin, Rodrigo A. Vicencio, Víctor A. Gopar
Abstract: Localization of coherent propagating waves has been extensively studied over the years, primarily in homogeneous random media. However, significantly less attention has been given to wave localization in inhomogeneous systems, where the standard picture of Anderson localization does not apply, as we demonstrate here. We fabricate photonic lattices with inhomogeneous disorder, modeled by heavy-tailed $\alpha$-stable distributions, and measure the output light intensity profiles. We demonstrate that the spatial localization of light is described by a stretched exponential function, with a stretching parameter $\alpha$, and an asymmetric localized profile with respect to the excitation site. We support our experimental and theoretical findings with extensive tight-binding simulations.

Title: Tuning excitons and superfluidity of dipolar excitons in the double layers of kagome lattice by applying circularly polarized irradiation
Authors: Sita Kandel, Godfrey Gumbs, Teresa lee, Oleg L. Berman
Abstract: We present detailed calculations for several significant properties of the kagome lattice. We employ the Floquet-Magnus perturbation expansion to obtain the energy bands and the corresponding wave functions near the Dirac points for the kagome lattice in the presence of circularly or linearly polarized irradiation. In contrast with linearly polarized irradiation, a band gap is opened up near the Dirac points, between the valence and conduction bands in the presence of circularly polarized irradiation. We calculated the exciton binding energy, and the exciton energy for gapped kagome lattice as a function of the frequency and intensity of the irradiation. We compare the exciton binding energy and exciton energy in a monolayer with those in a double layer separated by an insulator to inhibit recombination. We predict that a phase transition in the kagome lattice from the semiconducting phase to the excitonic insulating phase can be induced by applying irradiation. We also examined the conditions for such a phase transition. We explore opportunities to tune exciton binding energy, the energy spectrum of collective excitations, the sound velocity and the critical temperature of the superfluidity by applying circularly polarized irradiation. We propose observation of Bose-Einstein condensation and superfluidity of quasi-two-dimensional dipolar excitons in two-layer kagome lattices in the presence of pumping by circularly polarized light. We have also analyzed the dependence of superfluid density $n_s$ and the temperature of the Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition temperature on excitonic density n, the interlayer separation D and the parameters for circularly polarized light.

Title: Putative excitonic insulating state in narrow-gap semiconductor La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$
Authors: Caitlin S. Kengle, Noah Schnitzer, Elizabeth A. Peterson, Chunyu Guo, Ling Zhang, Matthew S. Cook, Jian-Xin Zhu, Sean M. Thomas, Philip J. W. Moll, Filip Ronning, Priscila F.S. Rosa
Abstract: Excitonic insulators are electronically-driven phases of matter characterized by the spontaneous condensation of electron-hole pairs. Here we show that La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$ undergoes a transition at $T_{0}=278$ K to a highly insulating state with no accompanying structural transition. We observe quasi-two-dimensional electrical transport and charge fluctuations consistent with an electronic transition enabled by enhanced Coulomb interactions. Density functional theory calculations are unable to replicate the insulating ground state. Our results support the opening of a gap by excitonic effects at $T_{0}$, placing La$_3$Cd$_2$As$_6$ as a rare example of a bulk excitonic insulator.

Title: Electron mobility in AlN from first principles
Authors: Amanda Wang, Nick Pant, Woncheol Lee, Jie-Cheng Chen, Feliciano Giustino, Emmanouil Kioupakis
Abstract: Aluminum nitride is a promising ultra-wide band gap semiconductor for optoelectronics and power electronics. However, its practical applications have been limited by challenges with doping and achieving high electrical conductivity. Recent advances in crystal quality and defect control have led to improvements in experimentally measured mobilities. In this work, we apply first-principles calculations to determine the upper limits of the electron mobility in AlN as a function of temperature, doping, and crystallographic orientation. We account for the combined effects of electron scattering by phonons and ionized impurity to model doped systems, and examine both full and partial ionization conditions. Our results show that the piezoelectric interaction from the long-range component of the acoustic modes is the dominant source of electron-phonon scattering at room temperature. Ionized-impurity scattering starts to dominate scattering at dopant concentrations above $10^{16}$ cm$^{-3}$, reducing the mobility by more than an order of magnitude in the high doping regime. Our calculated Hall mobility values are in good agreement with experimental data for samples with comparable dopant concentrations. We also find that electron mobilities as high as $956$ cm$^2$/V$\cdot$s could be achievable at lower dopant concentrations.

Title: Aluminum oxide coatings on Co-rich cathodes and interactions with organic electrolyte
Authors: M.D. Hashan C. Peiris, Michael Woodcox, Diana Liepinya, Robert Shephard, Hao Liu, Manuel Smeu
Abstract: Lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) have become essential in modern energy storage; however, their performance is often limited by the stability and efficiency of their components, particularly the cathode and electrolyte. Transition metal layered oxide cathodes, a popular choice for lithium-ion batteries (LIBs), suffer from several degradation mechanisms, including capacity fading, reactions with the electrolyte, unstable cathode-electrolyte interfaces, and lattice breakdown during cycling. In recent years, oxide coating, such as alumina, has emerged as a promising strategy to enhance the durability of cathodes by forming a protective layer that mitigates detrimental reactions and improves the stability of the cathode electrolyte interphase (CEI). This study employs ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations to investigate the chemical and mechanical behavior of LiCoO2 cathodes with and without aluminum oxide coatings in contact with an organic electrolyte. We examine the interactions between electrolyte molecules with both bare and coated cathode surfaces, focusing on the decomposition of ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC), the formation of oxygen species, and solvation dynamics, and evaluate the mechanical robustness of the cathode-coating interface using calculations of axial strain and cleavage energy. Our findings reveal that alumina coatings effectively reduce electrolyte degradation and stabilize the cathode structure, particularly under high-charge states. The coating's thickness and structural orientation are crucial in enhancing mechanical strength and minimizing detrimental reactions at the cathode-electrolyte interface. These insights contribute to the development of more durable LIBs by optimizing the interface chemistry and mechanical properties, providing a pathway toward higher energy densities and longer cycle life.

Title: Comparing classical and machine learning force fields for modeling deformation of solid sorbents relevant for direct air capture
Authors: Logan M. Brabson, Andrew J. Medford, David S. Sholl
Abstract: Direct air capture (DAC) with solid sorbents such as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) is a promising approach for negative carbon emissions. Computational materials screening can help identify promising materials from the vast chemical space of potential sorbents. Experiments have shown that MOF framework flexibility and deformation induced by adsorbate molecules can drastically affect adsorption properties such as capacity and selectivity. Force field (FF) models are commonly used as surrogates for more accurate density functional theory (DFT) calculations when modeling sorbents, but most studies using FFs for MOFs assume framework rigidity to simplify calculations. Although flexible FFs for MOFs have been parameterized for specific materials, the generality of FFs for reliably modeling adsorbate-induced deformation to near-DFT accuracy has not been established. This work benchmarks the efficacy of several general FFs in describing adsorbate-induced deformation for DAC against DFT. Specifically, we compare a common classical FF (UFF4MOF) with several machine learning (ML) FFs: M3GNet, CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, MACE-MPA-0, eSEN, and the Equiformer V2 model developed from the recent Open DAC 2023 dataset. Our results show that current classical methods are insufficient for describing framework deformation, especially in cases of interest for DAC where strong interactions exist between adsorbed molecules and MOF frameworks. The emerging ML methods we tested -- particularly CHGNet, MACE-MP-0, and Equiformer V2 -- appear to be more promising than the classical FF for emulating the deformation behavior described by DFT but fail to achieve the accuracy required for practical predictions.

Title: Spin-lattice entanglement in $\mathbf{CoPS}_3$

Abstract: Complex chalcogenides in the $M$PS$_3$ family of materials ($M$ = Mn, Fe, Co, and Ni) display remarkably different phase progressions depending upon the metal center orbital filling, character of the P-P linkage, and size of the van der Waals gap. There is also a stacking pattern and spin state difference between the lighter and heavier transition metal-containing systems that places CoPS$_3$ at the nexus of these activities. Despite these unique properties, this compound is under-explored. Here, we bring together Raman scattering spectroscopy and infrared absorption spectroscopy with X-ray techniques to identify a structural component to the 119 K magnetic ordering transition as well as a remarkable lower temperature set of magnon-phonon pairs that engage in avoided crossings along with a magnetic scattering continuum that correlates with phonon lifetime effects. These findings point to strong spin-phonon entanglement as well as opportunities to control these effects under external stimuli.

Abstract: This paper is an overview of some recent work done on the double perovskites. We discuss the physics of selected double perovskite compounds emphasizing the relevant interactions and resulting observable phenomena such as the magnetic order using different theoretical approaches. Spin-Orbit interaction, which is comparable to other relevant interaction strengths, plays a central role in determining the physics of such 4d-5d perovskites.

Title: Surrogate models to optimize plasma assisted atomic layer deposition in high aspect ratio features
Authors: Angel Yanguas-Gil, Jeffrey W. Elam
Abstract: In this work we explore surrogate models to optimize plasma enhanced atomic layer deposition (PEALD) in high aspect ratio features. In plasma-based processes such as PEALD and atomic layer etching, surface recombination can dominate the reactivity of plasma species with the surface, which can lead to unfeasibly long exposure times to achieve full conformality inside nanostructures like high aspect ratio vias. Using a synthetic dataset based on simulations of PEALD, we train artificial neural networks to predict saturation times based on cross section thickness data obtained for partially coated conditions. The results obtained show that just two experiments in undersaturated conditions contain enough information to predict saturation times within 10% of the ground truth. A surrogate model trained to determine whether surface recombination dominates the plasma-surface interactions in a PEALD process achieves 99% accuracy. This demonstrates that machine learning can provide a new pathway to accelerate the optimization of PEALD processes in areas such as microelectronics. Our approach can be easily extended to atomic layer etching and more complex structures.

Title: Droplet-gas phases and their dynamical formation in particle imbalanced mixtures
Authors: Jose Carlos Pelayo, George A. Bougas, Thomás Fogarty, Thomas Busch, Simeon I. Mistakidis
Abstract: We explore the ground state phase diagram and nonequilibrium dynamics of genuine two-component particle-imbalanced droplets in both isotropic and anisotropic three-dimensional confinements. A gradual transition from mixed droplet-gas to gas configurations is revealed as the average intercomponent attraction decreases or the transverse confinement becomes tighter. Within the mixed structures, a specific majority fragment binds to the minority droplet, satisfying the density ratio locking condition, while the remaining atoms are in a gas state. Our extended Gross-Pitaevskii numerical results are corroborated by a suitable variational approximation capturing the shape and characteristics of droplet-gas fragments. The tunability of the relatively low gas fraction is showcased through parametric variations of the atom number, the intercomponent imbalance, the trap aspect ratio, or the radius of a box potential. To validate the existence and probe the properties of these exotic phases, we simulate the standard time-of-flight and radio frequency experimental techniques. These allow to dynamically identify the resilience of the droplet fragment and the expansion of the gas fraction. Our results, amenable to current experimental cold atom settings, are expected to guide forthcoming investigations aiming to reveal unseen out-of-equilibrium droplet dynamics.

Title: Engineering topological phase transitions via sliding ferroelectricity in MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb) bilayers
Authors: Xinlong Dong, Dan Qiao, Zeyu Li, Zhenhua Qiao, Xiaohong Xu
Abstract: Materials combining electrically switchable ferroelectricity and tunable topological states hold significant promise for advancing both foundamental quantum phenomena and innovative device architectures. Here, we employ first-principles calculations to systematically investigate the sliding ferroelectricity-mediated topological transitions in bilayer MBi2Te4 (M = Ge, Sn, Pb). By strategically engineering interlayer sliding configurations with oppositely polarized states, we demonstrate reversible band inversion accompanied by topological phase transitions. The calculated spin-orbit-coupled bandgaps reach 31 meV (GeBi2Te4), 36 meV (SnBi2Te4), and 35 meV (PbBi2Te4), thereby enabling room-temperature observation of the quantum spin Hall effect. Crucially, these systems exhibit substantial out-of-plane ferroelectric polarization magnitudes of 0.571-0.623 pC/m, with PbBi2Te4 showing the maximum polarization (0.623 pC/m). The topological nontriviality is unambiguously confirmed by two independent signatures: (i) the computed z2 topological invariant, and (ii) the emergence of gapless helical edge states spanning the bulk insulating gap. This synergy arises from the unique sliding-induced charge redistribution mechanism, which simultaneously modulates Berry curvature and breaks in-plane inversion symmetry without disrupting out-of-plane polarization stability. The co-engineering of non-volatile ferroelectric switching and topologically protected conduction channels in MBi2Te4 bilayers establishes a material paradigm for designing reconfigurable quantum devices, where electronic topology can be electrically controlled via polarization reversal. Our results provide critical insights into manipulating correlated quantum states in van der Waals ferroelectrics for multifunctional nanoelectronics.

Title: Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Synthetic Magnetic Field with Tunable Orientation
Authors: Fengtao Pang, Huaxin He, Yongping Zhang, Chunlei Qu
Abstract: We systematically investigate the ground state and dynamics of spinor Bose-Einstein condensates subject to a position-dependent detuning. This detuning induces three related quantities-a synthetic magnetic field, an angular velocity, and an angular momentum-which, due to trap anisotropy, may point in different directions. When the dipole frequencies along the three symmetric axes of the harmonic trap are degenerate, the dipole motion can decompose into two coupled transverse modes in the plane perpendicular to the synthetic magnetic field, and another decoupled longitudinal mode, enabling controllable Foucault-like precession or bi-conical trajectories depending on the excitation protocol. Furthermore, quenching the orientation of the synthetic magnetic field excites multiple coupled quadrupole modes. We develop a hydrodynamic theory whose predictions match well with Gross-Pitaevskii simulations. This study contributes to a deeper understanding of the effects of the synthetic magnetic field and the excitations of the collective mode in quantum fluids, providing a foundation for future developments in quantum simulation and high-precision sensing technologies.

Title: Collective Oscillations of Bose-Einstein Condensates in a Synthetic Magnetic Field
Authors: Huaxin He, Fengtao Pang, Yongping Zhang, Chunlei Qu
Abstract: We study the collective oscillations of spin-orbit-coupled Bose-Einstein condensates in the presence of position-dependent detuning. Specifically, we explore the quadrupole modes of the system using both numerical and analytical approaches based on the Gross-Pitaevskii equation and hydrodynamic theory. Due to spin-orbit coupling and the synthetic magnetic field, {the $xy$ scissors mode couples with a superposition of the three diagonal quadrupole modes ($x^2$, $y^2$, and $z^2$),} resulting in the characteristic beating effect. {The remaining two scissors modes, $xz$ and $yz$, are coupled, giving rise to a Lissajous-like pattern that is highly sensitive to the excitation method and orientation of the synthetic magnetic field.} Furthermore, we find that anisotropic interactions as well as the direction of the synthetic magnetic field, can significantly influence the oscillation amplitude and frequency of the quadrupole modes. These findings highlight the potential of Bose-Einstein condensates under synthetic magnetic fields for quantum sensing applications, such as magnetic field {gradient} measurements, and provide a promising foundation for future experimental research and technological development.

Title: Optimizing Atomic Number Contrast in Multislice Electron Ptychography
Authors: Bridget R. Denzer, Colin Gilgenbach, James M. LeBeau
Abstract: Here we explore the atomic number ($Z$) dependence of multislice electron ptychography and approaches to optimize Z sensitivity. Specifically, we show that ptychography's $Z$-dependence is highly dependent on the integrated area of an atom column considered. A monotonic $Z$-dependence is found when the reconstructed projected atomic potentials are integrated over a small region. When increasing the integration area, $Z$-contrast changes significantly, becoming highly non-monotonic and following trends in the orbital shell-structure. Moreover, the reconstructed projected potential aligns with the transmission function with an overall deviation of only 2.4\%. The non-monotonic $Z$-dependence is further shown to be useful to accentuate contrast between certain elements, allowing for distinguishability of elements that are only a single atomic number apart, and even in $>$ 20 nm thick samples. This is demonstrated for $\beta$-CuZn ($Z$ = 29 and 30), with the differentiability between the elements explored for different signal quantification methods. The impact of electron dose and finite effective source size are also considered. These results demonstrate that the atom column integration area can optimize ptychographic $Z$-contrast for specific applications and experimental conditions.

Title: Molecular Dynamics Simulations of SrTiO$_3$ with Oxygen Vacancies using Neural Network Potentials
Authors: Kazutaka Nishiguchi, Ryota Yamamoto, Meguru Yamazaki, Naoki Matsumura, Yuta Yoshimoto, Seiichiro L. Ten-no, Yasufumi Sakai
Abstract: A precise analysis of point defects in solids requires accurate molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of large-scale systems. However, ab initio MD simulations based on density functional theory (DFT) incur high computational cost, while classical MD simulations lack accuracy. We perform MD simulations using a neural network potential (NNP) model (NNP-MD) to predict the physical quantities of both pristine SrTiO$_3$ and SrTiO$_3$ in the presence of oxygen vacancies (V$_{\text{O}}$). To verify the accuracy of the NNP models trained on different data sets, their NNP-MD predictions are compared with the results obtained from DFT calculations. The predictions of the total energy show good agreement with the DFT results for all these NNP models, and the NNP models can also predict the formation energy once SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$ data are included in the training data sets. Even for larger supercell sizes that are difficult to calculate using first-principles calculations, the formation energies evaluated from the NNP-MD simulations well reproduce the extrapolated DFT values. This study offer important knowledge for constructing accurate NNP models to describe point-defect systems including SrTiO$_3$:V$_{\text{O}}$.

Title: Phase Evolution and Substrate-Dependent Nucleation of Quartz GeO$_2$ Films Grown by MOCVD on r- and c-Plane Sapphires
Authors: Botong Li, Imteaz Rahaman, Hunter Ellis, Bobby G. Duersch, Kathy Anderson, Kai Fu
Abstract: Ultrawide-bandgap (UWBG) semiconductors, such as GeO$_2$, are gaining significant attention for their potential in high-performance applications, particularly in piezoelectric devices. Despite extensive research, a comprehensive understanding of the growth dynamics and phase evolution of GeO$_2$ films via metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) remains insufficient. In this study, we investigate the growth behavior and morphological evolution of GeO$_2$ thin films on r-plane and c-plane sapphire substrates for the MOCVD growth process. The temporal evolution of crystallization and the amorphous-to-quartz phase transition are systematically elucidated for the first time. As growth time increases, the spherulitic quartz patterns expand in size, and elevated growth temperatures are found to enhance the crystallization rate. Distinct morphological symmetries emerge depending on the substrate orientation: quadrangular patterns on r-plane sapphire and hexagonal patterns on c-plane sapphire. Atomic force microscopy reveals that these spherulitic domains exhibit pyramid-like surface topography, consistent with volumetric contraction during the amorphous-to-quartz phase transition. These findings offer new insights into the phase evolution and substrate-dependent crystallization behavior of GeO$_2$ films grown by MOCVD.

Title: Ferroelectric control of bipolar magnetic semiconductor with room Curie temperature
Authors: Jia-Wen Li, Gang Su, Bo Gu
Abstract: The development of room-temperature tunable magnetic semiconductors is crucial for the advancement of low-power, high-performance information technologies. Using density functional theory calculations, we propose a series of two-dimensional magnetic semiconductors with critical temperature above room temperature, including three ferromagnetic and two antiferromagnetic this http URL stability is confirmed through phonon spectra, molecular dynamics simulations, and formation energy calculations. In particular, we demonstrate a ferromagnetic bipolar magnetic semiconductor (BMS), Cr2NiSe4, formed via Ni intercalation into bilayer CrSe2, which exhibits a 0.40 eV band gap and a Curie temperature of 352 K. Nonvolatile carrier spin polarization control in Cr2NiSe4 is achieved by switching the ferroelectric polarization of an Al2Se3 substrate. Switching the ferroelectric state of monolayer Al2Se3 induces a BMS-to-half-metal transition. Reversing the polarization of bilayer Al2Se3 yields a half-metallic Cr2NiSe4 with fully opposite carrier spin polarization. Furthermore, we propose a multiferroic nonvolatile memory design: write operations are controlled by the ferroelectric polarization state of bilayer Al2Se3, while read operations rely on detecting the distinct carrier spin polarizations of Cr2NiSe4. Our work reports a two dimensional BMS with Curie temperature above room temperature and presents a feasible strategy for its nonvolatile electrical control.

Title: Ising superconductivity in bulk layered non-centrosymmetric 4H-NbSe2
Authors: Chandan Patra, Tarushi Agarwal, Rahul Verma, Poulami Manna, Shashank Srivastava, Ravi Shankar Singh, Mathias S. Scheurer, Bahadur Singh, Ravi Prakash Singh
Abstract: Transition metal dichalcogenides exhibit multiple polymorphs that enable the exploration of diverse quantum states, including valley-selective spin polarization, the valley Hall effect, Ising superconductivity, and nontrivial topology. Monolayer 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ is a promising candidate for realizing Ising superconductivity due to its spin-split, out-of-plane spin-polarized states arising from inversion symmetry breaking and strong spin-orbit coupling. In contrast, bulk 2$H$-NbSe$_2$ retains inversion symmetry and lacks spin splitting, limiting its suitability for hosting Ising superconductivity. Here, we report the growth of high-quality single crystals of the acentric bulk superconducting polymorph, 4$H$-NbSe$_2$, which intrinsically breaks the inversion symmetry and supports valley-selective spin-polarized states. Magnetization and resistivity measurements reveal anisotropic superconductivity, with the in-plane upper critical field exceeding the Pauli limit, while out-of-plane fields suppress superconductivity more rapidly, before reaching the Pauli limit, which strongly suggests the presence of Ising pairing. First-principles calculations and symmetry analysis confirm significant valley-selective spin splitting with out-of-plane spin polarization, further supporting the emergence of Ising superconductivity in 4$H$-NbSe$_2$. These results establish 4$H$-NbSe$_2$ as a robust bulk platform to investigate Ising superconductivity and valley-selective phenomena in transition-metal dichalcogenides.

Title: Unusual Valence of Ru and Prediction of Magnetism, Anomalous Hall Conductivity in a Newly Synthesized Double Perovskite Compound Ca_2CoRuO_6
Authors: Koushik Pradhan, Soumya Ghorai, Prabuddha Sanyal, Ryan Morrow, Bernd Büchner, Thirupathaiah Setti, Tanusri Saha Dasgupta
Abstract: With a goal to expand on the family of double perovskite compounds, hosting 3d transition metal and 4d or 5d transition metal, two new ordered double perovskite compounds, Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$ and Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ are synthesized following the prediction of a recent high throughput machine-learning study [Phys. Rev. Materials 3, 084418]. Experimentally both compounds are found to stabilize in monoclinic symmetry, which is consistent with the high-throughput prediction for Ca$_2$FeRuO$_6$, but at odd for Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$. Among the two synthesized compounds, the properties of Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, investigated employing the first principles technique \textcolor{black}{and model Hamiltonian calculation}, appear promising. The monoclinic structured Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$ is found to stabilize unusual 6+ valence of Ru, and support a half-metallic ground state with uncompensated net moment. As \textcolor{black}{predicted} by our first-principles study, the finite spin-orbit coupling at the Ru site contributes to the non-trivial topology of the band structure of monoclinic Ca$_2$CoRuO$_6$, resulting in a \textcolor{black}{moderately} large value of anomalous Hall conductivity. Our \textcolor{black}{theoretical predictions} should encourage further experimental investigation of this newly synthesized compound.

Authors: Dmitry A. Egorov, Dmitriy A. Pokhabov, Evgeny Yu. Zhdanov, Andrey A. Shevyrin, Askhat K. Bakarov, Alexander A. Shklyaev, Arthur G. Pogosov
Abstract: We demonstrate the crucial role of small-angle scattering in transverse magnetic focusing (TMF) in ballistic GaAs/AlGaAs heterostructures. Measurements in various samples show that the role significantly depends on their geometry. We propose a phenomenological model parameterizing this dependence with the angular acceptance of the detecting contact. This model is consistent with the diversity of experimental data and therefore enables accurate extraction of the key characteristic of inter-electron (e-e) interaction $\unicode{x2013}$ the e-e scattering length $\unicode{x2013}$ from TMF experiment, thus turning it into a uniquely effective tool for studying e-e scattering.

Title: Stability, electronic, magnetic and thermoelectric properties of quaternary Heusler alloys CoX'ZrAl (X'=V, Fe, Ir): 3d vs 5d systems
Authors: Poulami Biswas, Mahabubur Rahaman, Molly De Raychaudhury
Abstract: The thermoelectric (TE) properties of quaternary Heusler alloys (CoX'ZrAl; X'= V, Fe, Ir) are studied in the framework of Density Functional Theory and Boltzmann Transport Theory. The compound CoVZrAl is found to be semiconducting and the most difficult to be formed whereas the easier formed newly-predicted CoFeZrAl and CoIrZrAl are pseudo-gapped and half-metal respectively. Ferromagnetic calculations show magnetism in CoVZrAl and CoIrZrAl originating from the non-bonding Co-X' fully-filled t1u state and partially-filled eu state derived from Co-3d and X'-3d and 5d electrons respectively while CoFeZrAl is non-magnetic. The two-dimensional graphene-like density of states at the Fermi level in CoFeZrAl implies large electrical conductivity. We further observe that the presence of two 3d early Transition metal (TM) atoms enhances the Seebeck coefficient as in CoVZrAl and CoFeZrAl and the presence of extended 5d state of Ir diminishes the same for CoIrZrAl. However the higher thermal conductivity in CoFeZrAl renders CoVZrAl the best TE material among the three. The ZT value of n-type CoVZrAl is found to reach a higher value 1.4 at 600 K.

Title: Anisotropic In-plane Thermal Conductivity of Freestanding Few-layer ReS2
Authors: Manavendra Pratap Singh, Akshay Naik
Abstract: Rhenium disulfide (ReS2) is a unique TMDC with a strong in-plane anisotropy and weak interlayer coupling. The pronounced anisotropy in the thermal conductivity observed in bulk ReS2 flakes (exceeding 60 nm) makes them valuable for applications that require directional heat management or isolation. Whether this anisotropy is maintained below 10 nm has not yet been studied. Here, we measured the thermal conductivity of freestanding, exfoliated, few-layer ReS2 samples (thickness < 10 nm) on SiO2/Si holey substrates using the optothermal Raman technique. Polarization-dependent Raman measurements revealed variation in thermal conductivity along the high symmetry axes. The total in-plane thermal conductivities show a nonmonotonic trend with ReS2 thickness ranging from 2.5 to 8 nm. The in-plane thermal conductivity of few-layer ReS2 devices, which varies with thickness, holds significant potential for applications in nanoscale thermoelectric devices.

Title: Efficient broadband terahertz generation by above band-gap excitation of the pyroelectric ZnSnN2
Authors: T. S. Seifert, H. Hempel, O. Gückstock, R. Schneider, Q. Remy, A. Fioretti, T. Unold, S. Michaelis de Vasconcellos, R. Bratschitsch, R. Eichberger, K. Dörr, A. Zakutayev, T. Kampfrath
Abstract: Terahertz (THz) radiation is a powerful probe of low-energy excitations in all phases of matter. However, it remains a challenge to find materials that efficiently generate THz radiation in a broad range of frequencies following optical excitation. Here, we investigate a pyroelectric material, ZnSnN2, and find that above-band-gap excitation results in the efficient formation of an ultrafast photocurrent generating THz radiation. The resulting THz electric field spans a frequency range from below 1 to above 30 THz. Our results suggest that the photocurrent is primarily driven by an ultrafast pyroelectric effect where the photo-excited carriers screen the spontaneous electric polarization of ZnSnN2. Strong structural disorder reduces the photocarrier lifetime significantly and, thus, enables broadband operation. ZnSnN2 shows similar THz-emitter performance as the best spintronic THz emitters regarding bandwidth and amplitude. Our study unveils the large potential of pyroelectric materials as efficient and broadband THz emitters with built-in bias fields.

Title: Hall effect in isolated flat-band systems
Authors: Raigo Nagashima, Masao Ogata, Naoto Tsuji
Abstract: We study the Hall effect in isolated flat-band systems (i.e., a flat band is separated from other bands) for a weak magnetic field. In a naive semiclassical picture, the Hall conductivity vanishes when dispersive bands are unoccupied since there is no mobile carrier. To go beyond the semiclassical picture, we establish a fully quantum mechanical gauge-invariant formula for the Hall conductivity that can be applied to any lattice models. We apply the formula to a general two-band model with one dispersive and one isolated flat band, and find that the total conductivity takes a universal form as an integral of a product of the squared Berry curvature and energy difference between the two bands. In particular, the Hall coefficient can become nonzero in the flat-band systems with broken inversion symmetry. We numerically confirm this Hall effect for an isolated flat-band lattice model on the honeycomb lattice.

Title: Disorder-induced suppression of superconductivity in infinite-layer nickelates
Authors: Abhishek Ranna, Romain Grasset, Martin Gonzalez, Kyuho Lee, Bai Yang Wang, Edgar Abarca Morales, Florian Theuss, Zuzanna H. Filipiak, Michal Moravec, Marcin Konczykowski, Harold Y. Hwang, Andrew P. Mackenzie, Berit H. Goodge
Abstract: The pairing symmetry of superconducting infinite-layer nickelates is a fundamental yet experimentally challenging question. We employ high-energy electron irradiation to induce disorder in superconducting Nd$_{0.825}$Sr$_{0.175}$NiO$_2$ thin films and examine the impact of pair-breaking defects on superconductivity and elucidate the nature of the superconducting gap. Our measurements reveal a complete suppression of superconductivity with increasing disorder, suggesting an unconventional, sign-changing order parameter.

Title: Accelerating Resonant Spectroscopy Simulations Using Multi-Shifted Bi-Conjugate Gradient
Authors: Prakash Sharma, Luogen Xu, Fei Xue, Yao Wang
Abstract: Resonant spectroscopies, which involve intermediate states with finite lifetimes, provide essential insights into collective excitations in quantum materials that are otherwise inaccessible. However, theoretical understanding in this area is often limited by the numerical challenges of solving Kramers-Heisenberg-type response functions for large-scale systems. To address this, we introduce a multi-shifted biconjugate gradient algorithm that exploits the shared structure of Krylov subspaces across spectra with varying incident energies, effectively reducing the computational complexity to that of linear spectroscopies. Both mathematical proofs and numerical benchmarks confirm that this algorithm substantially accelerates spectral simulations, achieving constant complexity independent of the number of incident energies, while ensuring accuracy and stability. This development provides a scalable, versatile framework for simulating advanced spectroscopies in quantum materials.

Title: Charge Ordering in out-of-plane Boron Doped Reduced Graphene Oxide
Authors: Saikat Sarkar, Rajarshi Roy, Bikram Kumar Das, Suman Chatterjee, Kalyan Kumar Chattopadhyay
Abstract: Symmetry-breaking phase transitions analogous to superconductivity (SC), charge ordering (CO) etc. in metal-intercalated graphene are favorable resulting from modified electronic and phonon band structures. Strong carrier-lattice interaction evolved from the out-of-plane soft vibrations with accumulation of charges at the out-of-plane region, can set a favorable environment for CO in graphene system. Here, we employ boron-doped reduced graphene oxide (BG) to acquire charge-ordered state above a transition temperature, T1~97.5 K. Signatures of this state are identified using ab-initio simulations and low temperature electrical transport measurements. The out-of-plane boron groups play a crucial role in reinforcing the electron-phonon coupling (EPC) allowing an ordered-state transition. Temperature-dependent Raman spectroscopy further supports the emergence of ordering. Key characterization techniques (X-ray diffraction, Raman spectra etc.) are used to quantify the EPC interaction and associated factors like tensile strain, boundary defects, etc. affecting charge ordering with doping. Additionally, we find interesting electric field dependency on the CO in this non-metallic, light-atom-doped chemically derived graphene.

Title: Quantitative theory of magnetic properties of elemental praseodymium
Authors: Leonid V. Pourovskii, Alena Vishina, Olle Eriksson, Mikhail I. Katsnelson
Abstract: Elemental Pr metal crystallizes in the double hexagonal close packed (dhcp) structure and is unique among rare-earth elements in featuring a localized partially filled 4f shell without ordered magnetism. Experimental evidence attributes this absence of magnetism to a singlet crystal-field (CF) ground state of the Pr 4f$^2$ configuration, which is energetically well isolated from excited magnetic doublets. Here, we construct a realistic effective magnetic Hamiltonian for dhcp Pr, by combining density-functional theory with dynamical mean-field theory, in the quasiatomic Hubbard-I approximation. Our calculations fully determine the CF potential and predict singlet CF ground states at both inequivalent sites of the dhcp lattice. The intersite exchange interactions, obtained from the magnetic force theorem, are found to be insufficient to close the CF gap to the magnetic doublets. Hence, ab-initio theory is demonstrated to explain the unusual, non-magnetic state of elemental Pr. Extending this analysis to the (0001) surface of Pr, we find that the singlet ground state remains robust preventing conventional magnetic orders. Nevertheless, the gap between the ground state and the lowest excited singlet is significantly reduced at the surface, opening the possibility for exotic two-dimensional multipolar orders to emerge within this two-singlet manifold.

Title: Scaling the glassy dynamics of active particles: Tunable fragility and reentrance
Authors: Puneet Pareek, Peter Sollich, Saroj Kumar Nandi, Ludovic Berthier
Abstract: Understanding the influence of activity on dense amorphous assemblies is crucial for biological processes such as wound healing, embryogenesis, or cancer progression. Here, we study the effect of self-propulsion forces of amplitude $f_0$ and persistence time $\tau_p$ in dense assemblies of soft repulsive particles, a model system that interpolates between particulate active matter and biological tissues. We identify the fluid and glass phases of the three-dimensional phase diagram obtained by varying $f_0$, $\tau_p$, and the packing fraction $\phi$. The morphology of the phase diagram directly accounts for a non-monotonic evolution of the relaxation time with $\tau_p$, which is a direct consequence of the crossover in the dominant relaxation mechanism, from glassy to jamming. A second major consequence is the evolution of the glassy dynamics from sub-Arrhenius to super-Arrhenius. We show that this tunable glass fragility extends to active systems analogous observations reported for passive particles. This allows us to apply a dynamic scaling analysis proposed for the passive case, in order to account for our results for active systems. Finally, we discuss similarities between our results and recent findings in the context of computational models of biological tissues.

Title: Identifying Clean and Contaminated Atomic-Sized Gold Contacts under Ambient Conditions Using a Clustering Algorithm
Authors: Guillem Pellicer, Carlos Sabater
Abstract: Molecular electronics studies have advanced from early, simple single-molecule experiments at cryogenic temperatures to complex and multifunctional molecules under ambient conditions. However, room-temperature environments increase the risk of contamination, making it essential to identify and quantify clean and contaminated rupture traces (i.e., conductance versus relative electrode displacement) within large datasets. Given the high throughput of measurements, manual analysis becomes unfeasible. Clustering algorithms offer an effective solution by enabling automatic classification and quantification of contamination levels. Despite the rapid development of machine learning, its application in molecular electronics remains limited. In this work, we present a methodology based on the DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) algorithm to extract representative traces from both clean and contaminated regimes, providing a scalable and objective tool to evaluate environmental contamination in molecular junction experiments.

Title: Accelerating ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo simulations by delayed update and block force-bias update
Authors: Hao Du, Yuan-Yao He
Abstract: Ground-state auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo (AFQMC) methods have become key numerical tools for studying quantum phases and phase transitions in interacting many-fermion systems. Despite the broad applicability, the efficiency of these algorithms is often limited by the bottleneck associated with the {\it local update} of the field configuration. In this work, we propose two novel update schemes, the {\it delayed update} and {\it block force-bias update}, both of which can generally and efficiently accelerate ground-state AFQMC simulations. The {\it delayed update}, with a predetermined delay rank, is an elegantly improved version of the {\it local update}, accelerating the process by replacing multiple vector-vector outer products in the latter with a single matrix-matrix multiplication. The {\it block force-bias update} is a block variant of the conventional force-bias update, which is a highly efficient scheme for dilute systems but suffers from the low acceptance ratio in lattice models. Our modified scheme maintains the high efficiency while offering flexible tuning of the acceptance ratio, controlled by the block size, for any desired fermion filling. We apply these two update schemes to both the standard and spin-orbit coupled two-dimensional Hubbard models, demonstrating their speedup over the {\it local update} with respect to the delay rank and block size. We also explore their efficiencies across varying system sizes and model parameters. Our results identify a speedup of $\sim$$8$ for systems with $\sim$$1600$ lattice sites. Furthermore, we have investigated the broader applications as well as an application diagram of these update schemes to general correlated fermion systems.

Title: Dynamic structure factor of a driven-dissipative Bose-Hubbard model
Authors: Subhanka Mal, Anushree Dey, Kingshuk Adikary, Bimalendu Deb
Abstract: Dynamic structure factor (DSF) is important for understanding excitations in many-body physics; it reveals information about the spectral and spatial correlations of fluctuations in quantum systems. Collective phenomena like quantum phase transitions of ultracold atoms are addressed by harnessing density fluctuations. Here, we calculate the DSF of a nonequilibrium spinless Bose-Hubbard model (BHM) from the perspective of dissipative phase transition (DPT) in a steady state. Our methodology uses a homogeneous mean-field approximation to make the single-site hierarchy simpler and applies the Lindbladian perturbation method (LPM) to go beyond the single site, limited by the ratio of the inter-site hopping term to the Liouvillian gap as a small parameter. Our results show that the DSF near a DPT point is characteristically different from that away from the transition point, providing a clear density spectral signature of the DPT. In addition to comparing the two numerical frameworks, the mean-field results serve as a benchmark for proof-of-principle robustness of LPM. Despite the numerical difficulty, our methodology provides a computationally accessible route for studying density fluctuations in an open lattice quantum system without requiring large-scale computation.

Title: Temperature gradient-driven motion of magnetic domains in a magnetic metal multilayer by entropic forces
Authors: Lin Huang, Joseph Barker, Lekshmi Kailas, Soumyarup Hait, Simon D. Connell, Gavin Burnell, Christopher H. Marrows
Abstract: We studied the displacement of magnetic domains under temperature gradients in perpendicularly magnetized Ta/[Pt/Co$_{68}$B$_{32}$/Ir]$_{\times 10}$/Pt multilayer tracks with microfabricated Pt heaters/thermometers by magnetic force microscopy (MFM). Subtracting out the effects of the Oersted field from the heating current reveals the pure temperature gradient-driven motion, which is always towards the heater. The higher the thermal gradient along the track (owing to proximity to the heater or larger heater currents), the greater the observed displacements of the domains, up to a velocity of around 1~nm/s in a temperature gradient of 20~K/$\mu$m. Quantitative estimates of the strength of different driving mechanisms show that entropic forces dominate over those arising from the spin Seebeck and spin-dependent Seebeck effects.

Title: Crossover in growth law in the vapor-liquid phase separation inside complex porous medium
Authors: Preethi M, Bhaskar Sen Gupta
Abstract: We employ molecular dynamics simulations to investigate the domain morphology and growth kinetics of a vapor-liquid system embedded within a complex porous medium. By systematically varying the pore structure, we analyze the scaling behavior of correlation functions, structure factors, and domain growth exponents. The structure factor confirms the breakdown of Porod law and the emergence of fractal-like domain boundaries. Our key finding is the clear crossover in the domain growth law, from the classical power-law behavior observed in bulk fluids to a slower, logarithmic regime in highly confined systems. This transition is driven by energy barriers introduced by the porous geometry, which inhibit coarsening dynamics at later time. We provide a scaling analysis which further confirms this crossover and quantitatively connects the growth behavior with the average pore size.

Title: Influence of preparation and architecture on the elastic modulus of polymer networks
Authors: Jiting Tian, Jean-Louis Barrat, Walter Kob
Abstract: The elastic modulus $G$ of a polymer network depends notably on parameters such as the initial concentration of the monomers before the synthesis ($\rho_0$), the density of the cross-linker, or the topology of the network. Understanding how these factors influence the stiffness of the sample is hampered by the fact that in experiments it is difficult to tune them individually. Here we use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations to study how these quantities, as well as excluded volume interactions, affect the elastic modulus of the network. We find that for a regular diamond network, $G$ is independent of the initial monomer concentration, while for disordered networks (monodisperse or polydisperse) the modulus increases with $\rho_0$, at odds with the classical predictions for rubber elasticity. Analysis of the network structure reveals that, for the disordered networks, defects contribute only weakly to the observed increase, and that instead the $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ can be rationalized by the presence of a pre-strain in the sample. This pre-strain can be quantified by the topological factor introduced in the affine network theory (ANT). Comparison of the disordered networks with their phantom counterparts reveals that weakly crosslinked systems show a stronger $\rho_0$-dependence of $G$ due to an increase in entanglements at higher $\rho_0$, and that the polydisperse networks contain more entanglements than the monodisperse ones with the same average strand length. Finally we discuss the quantitative application of ANT to the simulated real networks and their phantom counterparts and conclude that the presence of excluded volume effects must be comprehensively taken into account for reaching a qualitative understanding of the mechanical modulus of the disordered networks.

Title: Electron-phonon couplings in locally disordered materials: The case of hybrid halide perovskites
Authors: Marios Zacharias, George Volonakis, Laurent Pedesseau, Claudine Katan, Feliciano Giustino, Jacky Even
Abstract: Positional polymorphism in solids refers to distributions of correlated locally disordered unit cells which reflect, on average, the high-symmetry structure observed in diffraction experiments. The standard theory of electron-phonon interactions is unable to account for the temperature-dependent electronic structure of polymorphous materials. A prime example of such materials is hybrid halide perovskites, for which calculations of band gaps at finite temperatures do not agree with experiment. Here, we develop a systematic and accurate methodology to investigate electron-phonon couplings in complex polymorphous materials, demonstrated through calculations of anharmonic phonons and thermally-induced band gap renormalization for a broad family of halide perovskites. Our approach delivers unprecedented agreement with experiment.

Title: Type III Valley Polarization and Anomalous Valley Hall Effect in Two-Dimensional Non-Janus and Janus Altermagnet Fe2WS2Se2
Authors: Yanchao She, Yiding Wang, Hanbo Sun, Chao Wu, Weixi Zhang, Ping Li
Abstract: Exploiting the valley degree of freedom introduces a novel paradigm for advancing quantum information technology. Currently, the investigation on spontaneous valley polarization mainly focuses on two major types of systems. One type magnetic systems by breaking the time-reversal symmetry, the other is ferroelectric materials through breaking the inversion symmetry. Might there be additional scenarios? Here, we propose to realize spontaneous valley polarization by breaking the mirror symmetry in the altermagnets, named type III valley polarization. Through symmetry analysis and first-principles calculations, we confirm that this mechanism is feasible in Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2. Monolayer Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 are stable Neel-type antiferromagnetic state with the direct band gap semiconductor. More interestingly, their magnetic anisotropy energy exhibits the rare biaxial anisotropy and a four-leaf clover shape in the xy plane, while the xz and yz planes show the common uniaxial anisotropy. This originated from the fourth-order single ion interactions. More importantly, the valley splitting is spontaneously generated in the Non-Janus Fe2WS2Se2 due to the Mxy symmetry breaking, without requiring the SOC effect. Both the Non-Janus and Janus Fe2WS2Se2 exhibit diverse valley polarization and anomalous valley Hall effect properties. In addition, the magnitude and direction of valley polarization can be effectively tuned by the biaxial strain and magnetic field. Our findings not only expand the realization system of spontaneous valley polarization, but also provide a theoretical basis for the high-density storage of valley degrees of freedom.

Title: Magnetic phases and zone-folded phonons in a frustrated van der Waals magnet

Abstract: 2D magnetic materials have attracted extensive research interest due to their potential application in nanospintronics, optospintronics, and in magnonics. Ferromagnetic as well as antiferromagnetic layered materials have been demonstrated and successfully inserted into van der Waals heterostructures. However, the effects of magnetic frustration in van der Waals materials and the possibilities offered by spin configurations characterized by nonlinear spin arrangements have not been fully considered yet. Herein, we establish the magnetic phase diagram of bulk CrOCl, a frustrated van der Waals magnet, using magnetization and magneto-optical spectroscopy techniques. In particular, we use the magnetic superstructures relative to the crystallographic unit cell and the associated rich zone-folded phonon series to describe the magnetic field induced phases. Theoretical calculations taking into account the competing nearest neighbors magnetic exchange interactions provide a unique insight into the lattice vibrations of this class of magnetic system. This study expands the scope of 2D magnetic materials and provides a methodology to characterize frustrated van der Waals magnets.

Title: Asymmetric Electronic Band Alignment and Potentially Enhanced Thermoelectric Properties in Phase-Separated Mg2X (X=Si,Ge,Sn) Alloys
Authors: Byungki Ryu, Samuel Foster, Eun-Ae Choi, Sungjin Park, Jaywan Chung, Johannes de Boor, Pawel Ziolkowski, Eckhard Müller, Seung Zeon Han, SuDong Park, Neophytos Neophytou
Abstract: The Mg2X (X=Si, Ge, Sn) based alloy is an eco-friendly thermoelectric material for mid-temperature applications. The Mg2Si1-xSnx and Mg2Ge1-xSnx alloys can be phase-separated into Si(Ge)- and Sn-rich phases during material synthesis, leading to a nanocomposite with locally varying electronic band structure. First-principles calculations reveal that the valence band offset is eight-times larger than the conduction band offset at the interface between Si- and Sn-rich phases for x=0.6, showing type-I and asymmetric band alignment (0.092 eV versus 0.013 eV). Using Boltzmann transport theory and thermionic emission calculations, we show that the large valence band energy discontinuity could allow for energy filtering effects to take place that can potentially increase the power factor substantially in the p-type material system if designed appropriately.

Title: Binary Mixtures of Intelligent Active Brownian Particles with Visual Perception
Authors: Rajendra Singh Negi, Roland G. Winkler, Gerhard Gompper
Abstract: The collective properties of a binary mixture of A- and B-type self-steering particles endowed with visual perception are studied by computer simulations. Active Brownian particles are employed with an additional steering mechanism, which enables them to adjust their propulsion direction relative to the instantaneous positions of neighboring particles, depending on the species, either steering toward or away from them. Steering can be nonreciprocal between the A- and B-type particles. The underlying dynamical and structural properties of the system are governed by the strength and polarity of the maneuverabilities associated with the vision-induced steering. The model predicts the emergence of a large variety of nonequilibrium behaviors, which we systematically characterize for all nine principal sign combinations of AA, BB, AB and BA maneuverabilites. In particular, we observe the formation of multimers, encapsulated aggregates, honeycomb lattices, and predator-prey pursuit. Notably, for a predator-prey system, the maneuverability and vision angle employed by a predator significantly impacts the spatial distribution of the surrounding prey particles. For systems with electric-charge-like interactions and non-stochiometric composition, we obtain at intermediate activity levels an enhanced diffusion compared to non-steering active Brownian particles.

Title: Rock-salt ScN(113) layers grown on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ by plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy
Authors: Duc V. Dinh, Esperanza Luna, Oliver Brandt
Abstract: Transition-metal nitrides constitute a versatile class of materials with diverse properties and wide-ranging applications. Exploring new surface orientations and uncovering novel properties can enable innovative material configurations with tailored functionalities for device integration. Here, we report the growth and characterization of (85-210)-nm-thick undoped ScN layers on AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$/Al$_{2}$O$_{3}$$(10\bar{1}0)$ templates via plasma-assisted molecular beam epitaxy. X-ray diffractometry and transmission electron microscopy confirm a pure (113) surface orientation with rotational twins. Two distinct in-plane relationships between ScN(113) and AlN$(11\bar{2}2)$ have been identified: the dominant $[1\bar{1}0]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[33\bar{2}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under tensile-compression), and the less prevalent $[\bar{1}\bar{2}1]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [1\bar{1}00]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ and $[7\bar{4}\bar{1}]_{\mathrm{ScN}} \parallel [\bar{1}\bar{1}23]_{\mathrm{AlN}}$ (under biaxial compression). Broad photoluminescence spectra with a peak emission energy of $\approx 2.16\,\mathrm{eV}$ originate from the lowest direct gap at the $\mathbf{X}$ point of the ScN band structure. Temperature-dependent Hall-effect measurements (4-380 K) reveal that impurity band conduction dominates. The electron mobility is primarily limited by optical phonon scattering, characterized by an effective phonon energy of $(60 \pm 3)\,\mathrm{meV}$.

Title: Magnon-polaron control in a surface magnetoacoustic wave resonator
Authors: Kevin Künstle, Yannik Kunz, Tarek Moussa, Katharina Lasinger, Kei Yamamoto, Philipp Pirro, John F. Gregg, Akashdeep Kamra, Mathias Weiler
Abstract: Strong coupling between distinct quasiparticles in condensed matter systems gives rise to hybrid states with emergent properties. We demonstrate the hybridization of confined phonons and finite-wavelength magnons, forming a magnon-polaron cavity with tunable coupling strength and spatial confinement controlled by the applied magnetic field direction. Our platform consists of a low-loss, single-crystalline yttrium iron garnet (YIG) film coupled to a zinc oxide (ZnO)-based surface acoustic wave (SAW) resonator. This heterostructure enables exceptionally low magnon-polaron dissipation rates below $\kappa / 2\pi < 1.5\;$MHz. The observed mode hybridization is well described by a phenomenological model incorporating the spatial profiles of magnon and phonon modes. Furthermore, we report the first observation of Rabi-like oscillations in a coupled SAW-spin wave system, revealing the dynamical formation of magnon-polarons in the time domain. These results establish a platform for engineering hybrid spin-acoustic excitations in extended magnetic systems and enable time-resolved studies of magnon-polaron states.

Title: Hidden degree of freedom implied by unusual nonlocal transport in a topological semimetal
Authors: Yongjian Wang, A. A. Taskin, Yoichi Ando
Abstract: The spin Hall and inverse spin Hall effects have established a principle to understand nonlocal charge transport due to an additional degree of freedom. This principle applies successfully to the nonlocal transport due to the valley degree of freedom in graphene or to the chiral degree of freedom in a Weyl semimetal. Here we report the discovery of an unusual nonlocal charge transport that cannot be explained by any known mechanism and hence points to the existence of a hidden degree of freedom. This phenomenon was found in ZrTe$_5$ in the nodal-line semimetal phase and it occurs in the ultraquantun limit driven by the magnetic field applied along the $a$-axis. Surprisingly, the decay length of the nonlocality increases linearly with the sample width and exceeds 100 $\mu$m, suggesting that the relevant degree of freedom experiences little scattering. This nonlocal transport shows up not only as a longitudinal voltage gradient, but also as an unusual nonlocal Hall effect. Such an exotic phenomenon in a topological material is unprecedented and implies new physics.

Title: The Stress-Force-Fabric relation across shear bands
Authors: Carmen Lee, Émilien Azéma, Karen Daniels
Abstract: The strength of granular materials is highly dependent on grain connectivity (fabric), force transmission, and frictional mobilization at the particle scale. Furthermore, these bulk properties are strongly dependent on the geometry and history of loading. It is well established that anisotropy in fabric and force transmission through a granular packing directly relates to the bulk scale strength of the packing via the Stress-Force-Fabric (SFF) relation. We have recently verified the validity of this framework for a broad variety of loading histories and geometries in experimental granular packings, using photoelastic disks to measure individual interparticle contact forces. By tracking both particle positions and interparticle contact force vectors, we mapped the anisotropy of the fabric and forces to the macroscale stress and strain and found excellent agreement between the anisotropic particle-scale measures and the macroscale responses in experiments. Here, we present an analysis of the effect of strong spatial gradients (shear bands) using the SFF framework in a sheared annular geometry, finding that there are strong variations in contact orientation depending on the location within or outside the shear band, even though the principal loading direction is uniform. This highlights that the fabric connectivity significantly changes across the shear band but does not contribute to the direct loading of the material. We disentangle the effects of packing fraction gradients and boundary constraints on the differences in fabric orientation.

Title: A consistent description of the kinetic processes of electrolyte ion transport in a dynamic porous medium
Authors: P. P. Kostrobij, B. M. Markovych, O. V. Viznovych, M. V. Tokarchuk
Abstract: The consistent description of kinetic and hydrodynamic processes is applied to the study of ion transport processes in the ionic solution-porous medium system. A system of equations is obtained for the nonequilibrium single-ion distribution function, the nonequilibrium average value of the energy density of the interaction of solution ions, and the nonequilibrium average value of the number density of particles in a porous medium. Using the fractional calculus technique, a generalized diffusion equation of the Cattaneo type in fractional derivatives is obtained to describe the processes of subdiffusion of particles in a porous medium.

Title: Generic Chiral Anomaly and Planar Hall Effect in a Non-Weyl System
Authors: Yongjian Wang, Alexander Wowchik, Thomas Boemerich, A. A. Taskin, Achim Rosch, Yoichi Ando
Abstract: The condensed-matter version of the chiral anomaly describes how electrons are pumped from a Weyl node with negative chirality to a Weyl node with positive chirality using parallel electric and magnetic fields. Key experimental signatures are a negative longitudinal magnetoresistance (LMR) and the planar Hall effect (PHE), both of which have been experimentally observed. Here, we show that the chiral anomaly explains key features of magnetotransport in the nodal-line semimetal ZrTe$_5$ despite the absence of Weyl points. The anomaly physics applies generically to materials in the quantum limit, when electron transport becomes quasi-one-dimensional, provided that Fermi velocities remain sufficiently large. This explains not only the negative LMR but also the PHE with a gigantic Hall angle and a highly unusual magnetic-field-angle dependence in ZrTe$_5$.

Title: Elastic properties of fluid mercury across the metal-nonmetal transition: Ab initio simulation study
Authors: T. Bryk, O. Bakai, A. P. Seitsonen
Abstract: We report an ab initio molecular dynamics study of fluid mercury at temperature 1750 K in the range of densities 7-13.5 g/cm$^3$. Along this isothermal line we performed an analysis of total charge fluctuations, which make evidence of neutral atom-like screening in fluid Hg for densities less than 9.25 g/cm$^3$, which practically coincides with the emergence of the gap in electronic density of states. High-frequency shear modulus, high-frequency and adiabatic speeds of sound, shear viscosity, Maxwell relaxation time and dispersion of collective excitations are analyzed as a function of density along the isothermal line.

Abstract: Controlling the redox landscape of transition metal oxides is central to advancing their reactivity for heterogeneous catalysis or high-performance gas sensing. Here we report single Cu atom sites (1.42 wt%) anchored on Co3O4 nanoparticles (Cu1-Co3O4) that dramatically enhance reactivity and molecular sensing properties of the support at low temperature. The Cu1 are identified by X-ray adsorption near edge structure and feature strong metal-support interaction between Cu2+ and Co3O4, as revealed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy. The ability of Cu1 to form interfacial Cu-O-Co linkages strongly reduces the temperature of lattice oxygen activation compared to CuO nanoparticles on Co3O4 (CuONP-Co3O4), as demonstrated by temperature-programmed reduction and desorption analyses. To demonstrate immediate practical impact, we deploy such Cu1-Co3O4 nanoparticles as chemoresistive sensor for formaldehyde vapor that yields more than an order of magnitude higher response than CuONP-Co3O4 and consistently outperforms state-of-the-art sensors. That way, formaldehyde is detected down to 5 parts-per-billion at 50% relative humidity and 75 °C with excellent selectivity over various critical interferents. These results establish a mechanistic platform for activating redox-active supports using single-atom isolates of non-noble nature that yield drastically enhanced and well-defined reactivity to promote low-temperature oxidation reactions and selective analyte sensing.

Title: Probing anyon statistics on a single-edge loop in the fractional quantum Hall regime
Authors: Flavio Ronetti, Noé Demazure, Jérôme Rech, Thibaut Jonckheere, Benoît Grémaud, Laurent Raymond, Masayuki Hashisaka, Takeo Kato, Thierry Martin
Abstract: We propose a setup to directly measure the anyonic statistical angle on a single edge of a fractional quantum Hall system, without requiring independent knowledge of non-universal parameters. We consider a Laughlin edge state bent into a closed loop geometry, where tunneling processes are controllably induced between the endpoints of the loop. To illustrate the underlying physical mechanism, we compute the time-dependent current generated by the injection of multiple anyons, and show that its behavior exhibits distinctive features governed by the anyonic statistical angle. The measured current reflects quantum interference effects due to the time-resolved braiding of anyons at the junction. To establish experimental relevance, we introduce a protocol where anyons are probabilistically injected upstream of the loop via a quantum point contact (QPC) source. Unlike in Fabry-Perot interferometers, where phase jumps occur spontaneously due to stochastic quasi-particle motion, here the phase jumps are deliberately induced by source injections. These events imprint measurable signatures in the cross-correlation noise, enabling a controlled statistical analysis of the braiding phase. We further show that, by varying the magnetic field while remaining within the same fractional quantum Hall plateau, the statistical angle can be extracted without relying on the knowledge of other non-universal system parameters. Our results provide a minimal and accessible platform for probing anyonic statistics using a single chiral edge.

Title: Two-site entanglement in the two-dimensional Hubbard model
Authors: Frederic Bippus, Anna Kauch, Gergő Roósz, Christian Mayrhofer, Fakher Assaad, Karsten Held
Abstract: The study of entanglement in strongly correlated electron systems typically requires knowledge of the reduced density matrix. Here, we apply the parquet dynamical vertex approximation to study the two-site reduced density matrix at varying distance, in the Hubbard model at weak coupling. This allows us to investigate the spatial structure of entanglement in dependence of interaction strength, electron filling, and temperature. We compare results from different entanglement measures, and benchmark against quantum Monte Carlo.

Title: Photo-induced directional transport in extended SSH chains
Authors: Usham Harish Kumar Singha, Kallol Mondal, Sudin Ganguly, Santanu K. Maiti
Abstract: We investigate the current-voltage characteristics of an extended Su-Schrieffer-Heeger (SSH) chain under irradiation by arbitrarily polarized light, demonstrating its potential as a light-controlled rectifier. Irradiation of light induces anisotropy in the system, enabling directional current flow and active control of rectification behavior. Our analysis demonstrates that, under optimized light parameters, the rectification efficiency can exceed 90\%. Moreover, the direction of rectification-whether positive or negative-can be precisely controlled by varying the polarization of the light, highlighting the potential for external optical control of electronic behavior. The effect of light irradiation is incorporated using the Floquet-Bloch ansatz combined with the minimal coupling scheme, while charge transport is computed through the nonequilibrium Green's function formalism within the Landauer-Büttiker framework.

Title: Influence of photon-magnon coupling to enhance spin-wave excitation
Authors: Liubov Ivzhenko, Sergey Polevoy, Sergey Nedukh, Maciej Krawczyk
Abstract: One of the main challenges in magnonics is the efficiency of the conversion of microwave signals into spin waves. This efficiency is low due to the significant mismatch between microwave and spin wave wavelengths in the GHz range $10^{-2}$ m and $10^{-8}$ m, respectively, leading to high energy consumption in magnonic circuits. To address this issue, we propose an approach based on a planar inverse split-ring resonator (ISRR) loaded with a nanometer-thick Py film and exploiting the photon-magnon coupling effect. Our numerical studies show that the ISRR-based antenna achieves more than a fourfold improvement in conversion efficiency compared to a conventional single microstrip transmission line at frequencies and bias magnetic fields around the anti-crossing frequency gap. This has been demonstrated in the weak photon-magnon coupling regime for the nanometer-thin permalloy film with micrometer lateral dimensions. Further optimization of the ISRR can help to achieve the strong coupling regime, making the system potentially useful for quantum technology. Our compact and efficient antenna design offers a significant advantage over standard microstrip lines, paving the way for scalable and powerful magnonic circuits for microwave signal processing.

Title: Surface Induced Frustration of Inherent Dipolar Order in Nanoconfined Water
Authors: Sayantan Mondal, Saumyak Mukherjee, Biman Bagchi
Abstract: Surface effects could play a dominant role in modifying the natural liquid order. In some cases, the effects of the surface interactions can propagate inwards, and even can interfere with a similar propagation from opposite surfaces. This can be particularly evident in liquid water under nano-confinement. The large dipolar cross-correlations among distinct molecules that give rise to the unusually large dielectric constant of water (and in turn owe their origin to the extended hydrogen bond (HB) network) can get perturbed by surfaces. The perturbation can propagate inwards and then interfere with the one from the opposite surface if confinement is only a few layers wide. This can give rise to short-to-intermediate range solvent-mediated interaction between two surfaces. Here we study the effects of such interactions on the dielectric constant of nano-confined liquids, not just water but also ordering at protein surfaces. The surfaces work at two levels: (i) induce orientational realignment, and (ii) alter the cross-correlations between water molecules. Molecular dynamics simulations and statistical analyses are used to address these aspects in confinement of slit pores, nano tube/cylinder, and nano sphere. In addition, we consider the hydration layers of multiple proteins with vastly different structural features. These studies give us a measure of the extent or the length scale of cross-correlations between dipole moments of water molecules. We find an interesting orientational arrangement in the protein hydration layers, giving rise to long-range molecular cross-correlations. To decouple the effect of HB from the effect of geometry, we additionally study acetonitrile under nanoconfinement. Importantly, while a protein's interior is characterized by a small dielectric constant, the dipole moment of a peptide bond is large, and thus susceptible to fluctuations in water.

Title: Fermi surface and effective masses of IrO$_2$ probed by de Haas-van Alphen quantum oscillations
Authors: Kathrin Götze, Matthew J. Pearce, Suchit Negi, Jian-Rui Soh, Dharmalingam Prabhakaran, Paul A. Goddard
Abstract: Iridium-containing conducting materials are widely investigated for their strong spin-orbit coupling and potential topological properties. Recently the commonly used electrode material iridium dioxide was found to host a large spin-Hall conductivity and was shown to support Dirac nodal lines. Here we present quantum-oscillation experiments on high-quality IrO$_2$ single crystals using the de Haas-van Alphen effect measured using torque magnetometry with a piezo-resistive microcantilever as well as density functional theory-based band-structure calculations. The angle, temperature and field dependencies of the oscillations and the calculated band dispersion provide valuable information on the properties of the charge carriers, including the Fermi-surface geometry and electronic correlations. Comparison of experimental results to calculations allows us to assigns the observed de Haas-van Alphen frequencies to the calculated Fermi surface topology. We find that the effective masses of IrO$_2$ are enhanced compared to the rest electron mass $m_e$, ranging from 1.9 to 3.0~$m_e$, whereas the scattering times indicate excellent sample quality. We discuss our results in context with recent ARPES and band-structure calculation results that found Dirac nodal lines in IrO$_2$ and compare the effective masses and other electronic properties to those of similar materials like the nodal chain metal ReO$_2$ in which Dirac electrons with very light effective masses have been observed.

Title: Anomalous slow-down of the bound state dynamics in a non-locally coupled quantum circuit
Authors: Biswajit Paul, Suman Mondal, Tapan Mishra
Abstract: Additional hopping channels in a tight-binding lattice is known to introduce faster dynamics of a quantum mechanical particle. However, we show that in the case of a repulsively bound state, the dynamics becomes abnormally slow when next-nearest neighbor (NNN) hopping is allowed for the particles. We show that such slowing down occurs for some magic strength of the NNN hopping at which the bound state band exhibits a quasi-flatband feature. We reveal this anomalous dynamical behavior by analyzing the quench dynamics of two nearest neighbor (NN) spin excitations (magnons) on a ferromagnetic chain by allowing both NN and NNN couplings. By implementing digital quantum computing simulations on a NISQ device, we obtain such non-trivial signatures and complement the results with exact numerical calculations. Moreover, through perturbative arguments, we reveal that the slowing down is due to the destructive interference between different paths associated to the bound state dynamics.

Title: Coexistence of static and dynamic local magnetic fields in an S = 3/2 honeycomb lattice antiferromagnet Co2Te3O8
Authors: J. Khatua, Suheon Lee, M. Pregelj, Samiul Sk, S. K. Panda, Bassam Hitti, Gerald D. Morris, I. da Silva, Kwang-Yong Choi, P. Khuntia
Abstract: Two-dimensional honeycomb lattices, characterized by their low coordination numbers, provide a fertile platform for exploring various quantum phenomena due to the intricate interplay between competing magnetic interactions, spin-orbit coupling, and crystal electric fields. Beyond the widely studied Jeff= 1/2 honeycomb systems, S = 3/2 honeycomb lattices present a promising alternative route to realizing the classical spin liquid-like state within the spin-S Kitaev models. Herein, we present crystal structure, thermodynamic, neutron diffraction and muon spin relaxation (muSR) measurements, complemented by density functional theory (DFT) calculations on an unexplored 3d transition metal based compound Co2Te3O8, where Co2+ (S = 3/2) ions form a distorted honeycomb lattice in the crystallographic bc-plane without any anti-side disorder between constituent atoms. A clear lambda type anomaly around 55 K in both magnetic susceptibility and specific heat data indicates the onset of a long-range ordered state below TN= 55 K. The dominant antiferromagnetic interaction between S = 3/2 moments is evidenced by a relatively large negative Curie-Weiss temperature of -103 K derived from magnetic susceptibility data and supported by DFT calculations. The signature of long-range antiferomagnetic order state in the thermodynamic data is corroborated by neutron diffraction and muSR results. Furthermore, muSR experiments reveal the coexistence of static and dynamic local magnetic fields below TN, along with a complex magnetic structure that can be associated with XY-like antiferromagnet, as confirmed by neutron diffraction experiments.

Title: Surface phase behavior, not hydrogen bonding, governs hydrophobic attraction between extended solutes
Authors: Nigel B. Wilding, Francesco Turci
Abstract: Hydrophobic interactions are central to biological self-assembly and soft matter organization, yet their microscopic origins remain debated. Traditional explanations often attribute the increase in attraction between hydrophobic solutes with increasing temperature to entropy changes resulting from disrupted hydrogen bonding in water. Here, we present a different perspective based on the physics of surface phase transitions, supported by extensive molecular dynamics simulations. Using well-tempered metadynamics, we quantify the solvent-mediated potential of mean force between nanometer-scale hydrophobic solutes in the monatomic water model (mW), the SPC/E water model, and a Lennard-Jones solvent. We develop a morphometric model grounded in a scaling theory of critical drying, linking the range and strength of hydrophobic attraction to interfacial thermodynamics and deviations from vapor-liquid coexistence, rather than specific hydrogen-bonding effects. Our results reproduce the characteristic inverse temperature dependence of hydrophobicity and demonstrate that such behavior arises generically due to a rapid thermal expansion of the solvation shell, independent of hydrogen bonding. This work reframes hydrophobic interactions between extended solutes as a universal solvophobic phenomenon governed by surface phase behavior.

Title: Magnetic excitations and exchange parameters of a nickel chain compound PbMn$_2$Ni$_6$Te$_3$O$_{18}$: Neutron scattering and density functional theory studies
Authors: S. Uthayakumar, D. T. Adroja, Amit Pokhriyal, A. K. Bera, Haranath Ghosh, Tatiana Gudi, Manh Duc Le, Christian Balz, R. A. Ewings, Minal Gupta, P. R. Sagdeo, D. Prabhakaran, J.P. Goff
Abstract: We have investigated the quasi-one dimensional Ni-chain compound PbMn$_2$Ni$_6$Te$_2$O$_{18}$ using theoretical DFT calculations, inelastic neutron scattering and optical spectroscopy in order to understand the nature of magnetic exchange interactions. Our inelastic neutron scattering study at 5 K on a powder sample reveals two bands of magnetic excitations, the first near 8 meV and the second near 18 meV originating from the antiferromagnetic zone center near $Q$ = 1~Å. On the other hand at 100 K (which is above T$_N$ = 86 K) a broad diffuse scattering signal is observed indicating the presence of short range magnetic correlations. We have analyzed the magnetic excitations based on the Linear Spin Wave Theory (LSWT) and compared the experimentally estimated exchange parameters with the DFT calculations. Our analysis reveals that the value of the exchange parameter at the larger distance (d=3.654 $Å$) $J_3$=4.21(8) meV between Ni-Ni (from inter-chain) is the strongest amongst the allowed six exchange parameters, which suggests that this system is not really a quasi-one-dimensional and confirmed by the absence of a Haldane gap. We have also presented the electronic structure calculations. The spin-polarized partial density of states (DOS) projected onto the Mn-d and Ni-d orbitals reveals that the Ni-d$_{x^2-y^2}$ contribution is dominant below the Fermi level in the spin-up and spin-down channel, while a minimal contribution from spin-up Mn states in the occupied region, suggesting a nearly high-spin state. The estimated Néel temperature, based on experimental exchange parameters is found to be in close agreement with the experimental value.

Title: Unusual electron correlations in Kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A= K, Rb, Cs)
Authors: Feihu Liu, Changxu Liu, Maolin Zeng, Qiyi Zhao
Abstract: The investigation of electronic order-quantum phase interplay in Kagome lattices commonly employs the extended Kagome-Hubbard model, where the critical parameters comprise on-site $(U)$ and intersite $(V)$ Coulomb interactions. In prototypical kagome metals $AV_3Sb_5$ (A = K, Rb, Cs), the geometrically frustrated quasi-2D architecture induces pressure-dependent complexity in vanadium d-electron correlations, necessitating systematic theoretical scrutiny. Utilizing the $d-dp$ model within constrained random phase approximation (cRPA), we quantified $U$, $V$, and Hund's coupling $J$ under hydrostatic pressure (0-9 GPa). While $KV_3Sb_5$ and $RbV_3Sb_5$ exhibit pressure-insensitive interaction parameters, $CsV_3Sb_5$ manifests anomalous discontinuities in $U$ and $V$ near $0.2$ GPa, suggesting a first-order electronic phase transition. This work establishes cRPA-derived interaction landscapes as critical predictors for pressure-tunable quantum phenomena in correlated kagome systems, offers a new insight into the understanding of the interplay between the CDW transition and the double superconductivity dome in $CsV_3Sb_5$ at low pressure.

Title: Sequential Dynamics in Ising Spin Glasses
Authors: Yatin Dandi, David Gamarnik, Francisco Pernice, Lenka Zdeborová
Abstract: We present the first exact asymptotic characterization of sequential dynamics for a broad class of local update algorithms on the Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model with Ising spins. Focusing on dynamics implemented via systematic scan -- encompassing Glauber updates at any temperature -- we analyze the regime where the number of spin updates scales linearly with system size. Our main result provides a description of the spin-field trajectories as the unique solution to a system of integro-difference equations derived via Dynamical Mean Field Theory (DMFT) applied to a novel block approximation. This framework captures the time evolution of macroscopic observables such as energy and overlap, and is numerically tractable. Our equations serve as a discrete-spin sequential-update analogue of the celebrated Cugliandolo-Kurchan equations for spherical spin glasses, resolving a long-standing gap in the theory of Ising spin glass dynamics. Beyond their intrinsic theoretical interest, our results establish a foundation for analyzing a wide variety of asynchronous dynamics on the hypercube and offer new avenues for studying algorithmic limitations of local heuristics in disordered systems.

Title: Microscopic investigation of enhanced Pauli paramagnetism in metallic Pu$_2$C$_3$

Abstract: A combined study of the structural and electronic properties of polycrystalline Pu$_2$C$_3$ is reported based on x-ray diffraction, specific heat, magnetic susceptibility, ${}^{13}$C nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), and band structure calculations. X-ray diffraction reveals a global noncentrosymmetric cubic lattice, with a nearest-neighbor C--C bond length of $r = 1.38$ Å. ${}^{13}$C NMR measurements indicate that the global cubic symmetry is locally broken, revealing two unique carbon environments. Magnetic susceptibility suggests enhanced Pauli paramagnetism, and specific heat reveals a moderately large electronic Sommerfeld coefficient $\gamma = 45$ mJ mol$_{\mathrm{Pu}}^{-1}$ K$^{-2}$, with a Wilson ratio $R_W \approx 1.3$ further indicating moderate correlations. ${}^{13}$C nuclear spin-lattice relaxation rate ($1/T_1$) and Knight shift ($K$) measurements find metallic Korringa behavior (i.e., $T_1TK^2=$ const.) with modest ferromagnetic spin fluctuations at low temperature. Taken together, the data point to a delocalized nature of a narrow 5$f$-electron band with weak electronic correlations. Density functional theory band-structure calculations confirm the appearance of such narrow 5$f$ bands near the Fermi level. Our data provide prime evidence for a plutonium-based metallic system with weak electronic correlations, which sheds new light on the understanding of complex paramagnetism in actinide-based metallic compounds.

Title: Discrete-space and -time analogue of a super-diffusive fractional Brownian motion
Authors: Enzo Marinari, Gleb Oshanin
Abstract: We discuss how to construct reliably well "a lattice and an integer time" version of a super-diffusive continuous-space and -time fractional Brownian motion (fBm) -- an experimentally-relevant non-Markovian Gaussian stochastic process with an everlasting power-law memory on the time-evolution of thermal noises extending over the entire past. We propose two algorithms, which are both validated by extensive numerical simulations showing that the ensuing lattice random walks have not only the same power-law covariance function as the standard fBm, but also individual trajectories follow those of the super-diffusive fBm. Finding a lattice and an integer time analogue of a sub-diffusion fBm, which is an anti-persistent process, remains a challenging open problem. Our results also clarify the relevant difference between sub-diffusive and super-diffusive fBm, that are frequently seen as two very analogous realizations of processes with memory. They are indeed substantially different.

Title: Emergent anisotropic three-phase order in critically doped superconducting diamond films

Abstract: Two decades since its discovery, superconducting heavily boron-doped diamond (HBDD) still presents unresolved fundamental questions whose resolution is relevant to the development of this material for quantum technologies. We use electrical magnetotransport measurements of critically-doped homoepitaxial single crystal HBDD films to reveal signatures of intrinsic (electronic) granular superconductivity. By studying the dependence of electrical resistivity on temperature and magnetic field vector, we infer that this granularity arises from electron correlations. This is revealed by a striking three-phase anisotropy in the magnetoresistance, accompanied by a spontaneous transverse voltage (Hall anomaly). Our findings indicate an emergent magnetically tunable intrinsic order in an otherwise isotropic three dimensional single crystal HBDD film, offering new insights into the mechanism of superconductivity in this quantum material.

Title: Optical spin pumping in silicon
Authors: Stefano Achilli, Damiano Marian, Mario Lodari, Emiliano Bonera, Giordano Scappucci, Jacopo Pedrini, Michele Virgilio, Fabio Pezzoli
Abstract: The generation of an out-of-equilibrium population of spin-polarized carriers is a keystone process for quantum technologies and spintronics alike. It can be achieved through the so-called optical spin orientation by exciting the material with circularly polarized light. Although this is an established technique for studying direct band-gap semiconductors, it has been proven limited in materials like Si that possess weak oscillator strengths for the optical transitions. In this study, we address the problem by presenting an all-optical analog of the spin pumping method. This involves the optical creation of a non-equilibrium spin population within an absorber, which subsequently transfers spin-polarized carriers to a nearby indirect gap semiconductor, resulting in polarized emission from the latter. By applying this concept to a Ge-on-Si heterostructure we observe luminescence from Si with an unrivaled polarization degree as high as 9%. The progressive etching of the absorbing layer, assisted by magneto-optic experiments, allows us to ascertain that the polarized emission is determined by effective spin injection aided by the carrier lifetime shortening due to extended defects. These findings can facilitate the use of highly promising spin-dependent phenomena of Si, whose optical exploitation has thus far been hampered by fundamental limitations associated with its peculiar electronic structure.

Title: Designing Corrosion-Resistant CoCrNi Medium Entropy Alloys via Short-Range Order Modification
Authors: Elaf A. Anber, Debashish Sur, Annie K. Barnett, Daniel L. Foley, Andrew M. Minor, Brian L. DeCost, Howie Joress, Anatoly I. Frenkel, Michael L. Falk, John R. Scully, Mitra L. Taheri
Abstract: Equiatomic CoCrNi medium entropy alloys are known for their unique properties linked to chemical short-range order (CSRO), crucial in both percolation processes and/or nucleation and growth processes influencing alloy passivation in aqueous environments. This study combines extended x-ray absorption fine structure, atomistic simulations, electrochemical methods, x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and transmission electron microscopy to explore CSRO evolution, passive film formation, as well as its characteristics in the as-homogenized CoCrNi condition, both before and after aging treatment. Results reveal a shift in local alloying element bonding environments post-aging, with simulations indicating increased Cr-Cr CSRO in 2nd nearest neighbor shells. Enhanced passive film formation kinetics and superior protection of the aged alloy in harsh acidified 3 mol/L NaCl solution indicate improved aqueous passivation correlated with Cr-Cr CSRO. This work establishes a direct connection between alloy CSRO and aqueous passivation in CoCrNi, highlighting its potential for tailored corrosion-resistant applications.

Title: Evidence for Bose liquid from anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of bad metal beta-Ta
Authors: Yiou Zhang, Chendi Xie, John Bacsa, Yao Wang, Sergei Urazhdin
Abstract: We report anomalous shot noise in nanojunctions of beta-tantalum, a ``bad" metal whose electronic properties are inconsistent with the Fermi liquid theory. Fano factors cluster around even multiples of the values expected for Fermi liquids, suggesting that beta-Ta may host a correlated charge liquid of Cooper pair-like electron groups. Further evidence for correlations is provided by the effects of magnetic impurities, as well as reduced density of states near the Fermi level indicated by point contact spectroscopy and first principles calculations. Our results open new avenues for studies and applications of electron correlations.

Title: Trotter transition in BCS pairing dynamics
Authors: Aniket Patra, Emil A. Yuzbashyan, Boris L. Altshuler, Sergej Flach
Abstract: We Trotterize the mean-field dynamics of the integrable BCS model using symplectic integrators. The resulting chaotic dynamics is characterized by its Lyapunov spectrum and rescaled Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy. The chaos quantifiers depend on the Trotterization time step $\tau$. We observe a Trotter transition at a finite step value $\tau_c \approx \sqrt{N}$. While the dynamics is weakly chaotic for time steps $\tau \ll \tau_c$, the regime of large Trotterization steps is characterized by short temporal correlations. We derive two different scaling laws for the two different regimes by numerically fitting the maximum Lyapunov exponent data. The scaling law of the large $\tau$ limit agrees well with the one derived from the kicked top map. Beyond its relevance to current quantum computers, our work opens new directions -- such as probing observables like the Loschmidt echo, which lie beyond standard mean-field description -- across the Trotter transition we uncover.

Title: Optimization of target film materials and protective coatings for sealed neutron generator
Authors: Yingying Cao, Sijia Zhou, Pingwei Sun, Jiayu Li, Shangrui Jiang, Shiwei Jing
Abstract: Magnesium target film has better thermal stability and neutron yield than titanium target, making it a potential neutron generator target film material. The radiation resistance of elemental magnesium targets is relatively weak, and their radiation resistance can be improved by alloying magnesium target films. The irradiation damage of pure magnesium targets and magnesium alloy target films was studied using SRIM. The results indicate that the irradiation damage of magnesium alloy target films (magnesium-niobium, magnesium-zirconium alloys) is lower than that of pure magnesium targets. In addition, under the same alloy ratio, the radiation resistance of magnesium-niobium alloy target film is better than that of magnesium-zirconium alloy. In order to further in-vestigate the performance of magnesium alloy target films, the incident ion energy, protective coatings (nickel oxide, aluminum oxide, palladium oxide), magnesium alloy target films, and alloy doping ratios (0.2, 0.4, 0.6, 0.8, 1.0) were changed. After calculating the effects of the above conditions on the neutron generator yield, sputtering yield, and considering irradiation damage, it was determined that a magnesium-zirconium alloy with a doping rate of 0.2 and a nickel oxide protective coating with a thickness of 7.5 nm are potential target film materials for the neutron generator.

Title: Generalized Symmetries in Shallow Water
Authors: V.Taghiloo, M.H.Vahidinia
Abstract: Recent developments have extended the concept of global symmetries in several directions, offering new perspectives across a wide range of physical systems. This work shows that generalized global symmetries naturally emerge in shallow water systems. In particular, we demonstrate that both global and gauge subsystem symmetries-previously studied primarily in exotic field theories-arise intrinsically in the dynamics of shallow water flows. A central result is that the local conservation of potential vorticity follows directly from the underlying gauge subsystem symmetries, revealing that the classic Kelvin circulation theorem is rooted in these symmetries. Notably, the associated charge algebra forms a Kac-Moody current algebra, with the level determined by the spatial variation of the Coriolis parameter. Beyond gauge symmetries, we also identify global subsystem symmetries, construct the corresponding Noether charges, and explore their potential applications.

Title: Classical algorithm inspired by the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization and local counterdiabatic driving
Authors: Takuya Hatomura
Abstract: We propose a quantum-inspired classical algorithm for combinatorial optimization problems, named the counterdiabaticity-assisted classical algorithm for optimization (CACAO). In this algorithm, a solution of a given combinatorial optimization problem is heuristically searched with classical spin dynamics based on quantum Lyapunov control of local counterdiabatic driving. We compare the performance of CACAO with that of quantum time-evolution algorithms, i.e., quantum annealing, the feedback-based algorithm for quantum optimization (known as FALQON), and the counterdiabatic feedback-based quantum algorithm (known as CD-FQA). We also study the performance of CACAO applied to large systems up to $10,000$ spins.

Title: Interpolations for a quantum Parisi formula in transverse field mean-field spin glass models
Authors: C. Itoi, K. Fujiwara, Y. Sakamoto
Abstract: A quantum Parisi formula for the transverse field Sherrington-Kirkpatrick (SK) model is proven with an elementary mathematical method. First, a self-overlap corrected quantum model of the transverse field SK model is represented in terms of the Hamiltonian with annealed random interactions. The interpolation given by Guerra and Toninelli is extended to the self-overlap corrected quantum model. It is proven that the infinite-volume limit of the free energy density exists in the operator formalism. Next, another interpolation developed by Guerra and Talagrand is applied to obtain a finite step replica-symmetry breaking (RSB) bound on the free energy density in the transverse field SK model. The interpolation enables us to show that the deviation of the RSB solution from the exact solution vanishes in the self-overlap corrected quantum model in a functional representation of the quantum spin operators. Finally, the corrected terms are removed by the Hopf-Lax formula for a nonlinear partial differential equation to show the quantum Parisi formula for the original transverse field SK model. The formula is extended to that for the transverse field mean-field $p$-spin glass model.

Title: Quench dynamics of negativity Hamiltonians
Authors: Riccardo Travaglino, Colin Rylands, Pasquale Calabrese
Abstract: In this paper, we investigate the quench dynamics of the negativity and fermionic negativity Hamiltonians in free fermionic systems. We do this by generalizing a recently developed quasiparticle picture for the entanglement Hamiltonians to tripartite geometries. We obtain analytic expressions for these quantities which are then extensively checked against previous results and numerics. In particular, we find that the standard negativity Hamiltonian contains both non-local hopping terms and four fermion interactions, whereas the fermionic version is purely quadratic. However, despite their marked difference, we show that the logarithmic negativity obtained from either are identical in the ballistic scaling limit, as are their symmetry resolution.

Title: A core-sensitive mixed $f$/$g$ mode of the Sun predicted by wave topology and hydrodynamical simulation
Authors: Arthur Le Saux, Armand Leclerc, Guillaume Laibe, Pierre Delplace, Antoine Venaille
Abstract: Helioseismology has revolutionized our understanding of the Sun by analyzing its global oscillation modes. However, the solar core remains elusive, limiting a full understanding of its evolution. In this work, we study a previously unnoticed global oscillation mode of the Sun using a fully compressible, hydrodynamical simulation of the solar interior, and assess that it is a mixed $f$/$g$ mode with a period of about one hour. This is the first global stellar hydrodynamics simulation that successfuly couple compressible and gravity modes. To understand this coupling, we invoke a recent theory on the nature of $f$-modes seen through the prism of wave topology, characterizing their ability to propagate deep into stellar interiors. We demonstrate that the mixed $f$/$g$ mode is highly sensitive to the core's rotation rate, providing a new promising pathway to explore the Sun's core.

Abstract: The fidelity of operations on a solid-state quantum processor is ultimately bounded by decoherence effects induced by a fluctuating environment. Characterizing environmental fluctuations is challenging because the acquisition time of experimental protocols limits the precision with which the environment can be measured and may obscure the detailed structure of these fluctuations. Here we present a real-time Bayesian method for estimating the relaxation rate of a qubit, leveraging a classical controller with an integrated field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Using our FPGA-powered Bayesian method, we adaptively and continuously track the relaxation-time fluctuations of two fixed-frequency superconducting transmon qubits, which exhibit average relaxation times of approximately 0.17 ms and occasionally exceed 0.5 ms. Our technique allows for the estimation of these relaxation times in a few milliseconds, more than two orders of magnitude faster than previous nonadaptive methods, and allows us to observe fluctuations up to 5 times the qubit's average relaxation rates on significantly shorter timescales than previously reported. Our statistical analysis reveals that these fluctuations occur on much faster timescales than previously understood, with two-level-system switching rates reaching up to 10 Hz. Our work offers an appealing solution for rapid relaxation-rate characterization in device screening and for improved understanding of fast relaxation dynamics.

Abstract: Understanding network functionality requires integrating structure and dynamics, and emergent latent geometry induced by network-driven processes captures the low-dimensional spaces governing this interplay. Here, we focus on generative-model-based approaches, distinguishing two reconstruction classes: fixed-time methods, which infer geometry at specific temporal scales (e.g., equilibrium), and multi-scale methods, which integrate dynamics across near- and far-from-equilibrium scales. Over the past decade, these models have revealed functional organization in biological, social, and technological networks.

Title: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering in telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures
Authors: E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, A. C. Leung, H. Rathee, A. K. C. Tan, K. D. Major, M. R. Vanner
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is a strong and readily accessible optical nonlinearity enabling a wide array of applications and research directions. For instance, the three-wave mixing process has been employed to great success for narrow-linewidth lasers, sensing applications, microscopy, and signal processing. While most of these avenues focus on room temperature operation, there is now increasing interest in cryogenic operation owing to the scattering mechanism's significant potential for applications and fundamental physics at low temperatures. Here, we measure the Brillouin scattering spectrum in standard single-mode telecommunications optical fiber at millikelvin temperatures using a closed-cycle dilution refrigerator and optical heterodyne detection. Our experiments are performed with a cryostat temperature from 50 mK to 27 K, extending previously reported measurements that utilized liquid helium-4 cryostats with temperatures greater than 1 K. At millikelvin temperatures, our experiment observes coherent acoustic interaction with microscopic defects of the amorphous material - two-level-systems (TLS) - which has not been previously observed in optical fiber. The measured behaviour of the linewidth with temperature is in agreement with well-established models of ultrasonic attenuation in amorphous materials comprising a background intrinsic scattering, thermally-activated scattering, and incoherent and coherent TLS interaction. This work provides a foundation for a wide range of applications and further research including sensing applications, new approaches to investigate TLS physics, and Brillouin-scattering-based quantum science and technology.

Title: Schwinger-Keldysh approach to tunneling transport at a hadron-quark interface
Authors: Tingyu Zhang, Hiroyuki Tajima, Motoi Tachibana
Abstract: We theoretically discuss quantum tunneling transport and frictions at a hadron-quark matter interface based on the Schwinger-Keldysh approach combined with the tunneling Hamiltonian, which has been developed in the context of condensed matter physics. In the inner core of massive neutron stars, it is expected that cold quark matter appears at sufficiently high densities and hence exhibits color superconductivity, surrounded by nucleon superfluids at lower densities. The perturbative expressions of the tunneling current and the friction at the interface are obtained in terms of the non-equilibrium Green's functions. We demonstrate the DC Josephson current that occurs at the hadron-quark superfluid interface in the present scheme. Our framework can be applied to various conflagrations involving the interfaces relevant to astrophysical phenomena.

Title: Radon Transforms and the SYK model
Authors: Michael Stone
Abstract: Motivated by recent work on the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev (SYK) model, we consider the effect of Radon or X-ray transformations, on the Laplace eigenfunctions in hyperbolic Bolyai-Lobachevsky space. We show that the Radon map from this space to Lorentzian-signature Anti-de Sitter or de Sitter space is easier to interpret if we use the Poincare disc model and eigenfunctions rather than the upper-half-plane model. In particular, this version of the transform reveals the geometric origin of the boundary conditions imposed on the eigenfunctions that are involved in calculating the SYK four-point function.

Title: Detecting (emergent) continuous symmetry of criticality via subsystem's entanglement spectrum
Authors: Bin-Bin Mao, Zhe Wang, Bin-Bin Chen, Zheng Yan
Abstract: The (emergent) symmetry of a critical point is one of the most important information to identify the universality class and effective field theory, which is fundamental for various critical theories. However, the underlying symmetry so far can only be conjectured indirectly from the dimension of the order parameters in symmetry-breaking phases, and its correctness requires further verifications to avoid overlooking hidden order parameters, which by itself is also a difficult task. In this work, we propose an unbiased way to numerically identify the underlying (emergent) symmetry of a critical point in quantum many-body systems, without prior knowledge about its low-energy effective field theory. Through calculating the reduced density matrix in a very small subsystem of the total system numerically, the Anderson tower of states in the entanglement spectrum clearly reflects the underlying (emergent) symmetry of the criticality. It is attributed to the fact that the entanglement spectrum can observe the broken symmetry of the entanglement ground-state after cooling from the critical point along an extra temperature axis.

Title: Choosing a Suitable Acquisition Function for Batch Bayesian Optimization: Comparison of Serial and Monte Carlo Approaches
Authors: Imon Mia, Mark Lee, Weijie Xu, William Vandenberghe, Julia W. P. Hsu
Abstract: Batch Bayesian optimization is widely used for optimizing expensive experimental processes when several samples can be tested together to save time or cost. A central decision in designing a Bayesian optimization campaign to guide experiments is the choice of a batch acquisition function when little or nothing is known about the landscape of the "black box" function to be optimized. To inform this decision, we first compare the performance of serial and Monte Carlo batch acquisition functions on two mathematical functions that serve as proxies for typical materials synthesis and processing experiments. The two functions, both in six dimensions, are the Ackley function, which epitomizes a "needle-in-haystack" search, and the Hartmann function, which exemplifies a "false optimum" problem. Our study evaluates the serial upper confidence bound with local penalization (UCB/LP) batch acquisition policy against Monte Carlo-based parallel approaches: q-log expected improvement (qlogEI) and q-upper confidence bound (qUCB), where q is the batch size. Tests on Ackley and Hartmann show that UCB/LP and qUCB perform well in noiseless conditions, both outperforming qlogEI. For the Hartmann function with noise, all Monte Carlo functions achieve faster convergence with less sensitivity to initial conditions compared to UCB/LP. We then confirm the findings on an empirical regression model built from experimental data in maximizing power conversion efficiency of flexible perovskite solar cells. Our results suggest that when empirically optimizing a "black-box" function in less than or equal to six dimensions with no prior knowledge of the landscape or noise characteristics, qUCB is best suited as the default to maximize confidence in the modeled optimum while minimizing the number of expensive samples needed.

A. Norcia
Abstract: Quantum processors based on neutral atoms trapped in arrays of optical tweezers have appealing properties, including relatively easy qubit number scaling and the ability to engineer arbitrary gate connectivity with atom movement. However, these platforms are inherently prone to atom loss, and the ability to replace lost atoms during a quantum computation is an important but previously elusive capability. Here, we demonstrate the ability to measure and re-initialize, and if necessary replace, a subset of atoms while maintaining coherence in other atoms. This allows us to perform logical circuits that include single and two-qubit gates as well as repeated midcircuit measurement while compensating for atom loss. We highlight this capability by performing up to 41 rounds of syndrome extraction in a repetition code, and combine midcircuit measurement and atom replacement with real-time conditional branching to demonstrate heralded state preparation of a logically encoded Bell state. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to replenish atoms in a tweezer array from an atomic beam while maintaining coherence of existing atoms -- a key step towards execution of logical computations that last longer than the lifetime of an atom in the system.

Title: A Diffuse-Interface Marangoni Instability
Authors: Xiangwei Li, Dongdong Wan, Haohao Hao, Christian Diddens, Mengqi Zhang, Huanshu Tan
Abstract: We investigate a novel Marangoni-induced instability that arises exclusively in diffuse fluid interfaces, absent in classical sharp-interface models. Using a validated phase-field Navier-Stokes-Allen-Cahn framework, we linearize the governing equations to analyze the onset and development of interfacial instability driven by solute-induced surface tension gradients. A critical interfacial thickness scaling inversely with the Marangoni number, $\delta_\mathrm{cr} \sim Ma^{-1}$, emerges from the balance between advective and diffusive transport. Unlike sharp-interface scenarios where matched viscosity and diffusivity stabilize the interface, finite thickness induces asymmetric solute distributions and tangential velocity shifts that destabilize the system. We identify universal power-law scalings of velocity and concentration offsets with a modified Marangoni number $Ma^\delta$, independent of capillary number and interfacial mobility. A critical crossover at $Ma^\delta \approx 590$ distinguishes diffusion-dominated stabilization from advection-driven destabilization. These findings highlight the importance of diffuse-interface effects in multiphase flows, with implications for miscible fluids, soft matter, and microfluidics where interfacial thickness and coupled transport phenomena are non-negligible.

Title: Ab Initio bulk free energy surface of proper ferroelectrics
Authors: Pinchen Xie, Yixiao Chen, Xinyu Xu, Zhi Yao, Weinan E, Roberto Car
Abstract: We report a systematic and accurate approach for deriving the bulk free energy surface (FES), a function of temperature, polarization, and strain, from the first-principles density functional theory (DFT) of proper ferroelectrics. The core of our approach is the metadynamics algorithm that extracts the polarization dependence of the FES from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations without an a priori ansatz. The rest of the FES is derived from the metadynamics trajectories that span the relevant phase space. We demonstrate our approach in the case of lead titanate. The errors across the phase transition, due to DFT numerics, all-atom molecular dynamics, and free energy evaluation by enhanced sampling, can be systematically controlled and are of the order of 1meV/atom. The accuracy of the resulting ab initio FES is only limited by the adopted functional approximation of DFT.

Title: Exploring water's no-man's land
Authors: Peter Lunkenheimer, Daniel Reuter, Arthur Schulz, Martin Wolf, Alois Loidl
Abstract: The investigation of water's glass transition and a possible liquid-liquid transition within its supercooled state is hampered by its inevitable crystallization in a temperature range, termed "no-man's land". Here we report dielectric-spectroscopy and calorimetry measurements of pure water and various aqueous LiCl solutions, part of the latter being quenched to avoid crystallization. By investigating solutions of relatively low salt content and by covering an exceptionally broad frequency range up to THz, we find strong hints at a crossover in water from a strong to a fragile liquid, characterized by different glass-transition temperatures and different non-Arrhenius temperature dependences of the molecular dynamics.

Title: Evidence of Ferroelectricity in an Antiferromagnetic Vanadium Trichloride Monolayer
Authors: Jinghao Deng, Deping Guo, Yao Wen, Shuangzan Lu, Hui Zhang, Zhengbo Cheng, Zemin Pan, Tao Jian, Dongyu Li, Hao Wang, Yusong Bai, Zhilin Li, Wei Ji, Jun He, Chendong Zhang
Abstract: A reduced dimensionality of multiferroic materials is highly desired for device miniaturization, but the coexistence of ferroelectricity and magnetism at the two-dimensional limit is yet to be conclusively demonstrated. Here, we used a NbSe2 substrate to break both the C3 rotational and inversion symmetries in monolayer VCl3 and thus introduced exceptional in-plane ferroelectricity into a two-dimensional magnet. Scanning tunneling spectroscopy directly visualized ferroelectric domains and manipulated their domain boundaries in monolayer VCl3, where coexisting antiferromagnetic order with canted magnetic moments was verified by vibrating sample magnetometer measurements. Our density functional theory calculations highlight the crucial role that highly directional interfacial Cl-Se interactions play in breaking the symmetries and thus in introducing in-plane ferroelectricity, which was further verified by examining an ML-VCl3/graphene sample. Our work demonstrates an approach to manipulate the ferroelectric states in monolayered magnets through van der Waals interfacial interactions.

Title: Interplay of Zeeman field, Rashba spin-orbit interaction, and superconductivity: Transition temperature and quasiparticle excitation
Authors: Chen Pang, Yi Zhou
Abstract: This paper provides a theoretical analysis on the effects of an external Zeeman field and Rashba spin-orbit interactions on superconductivity. We have extensively studied their influence on the superconducting transition temperature $T_c$ and the quasiparticle excitation energy. Our investigation includes a detailed examination of both the $s$-wave and $p$-wave pairing states. Implications for the recently discovered family of superconductors, A$_2$Cr$_3$As$_3$ (A = Na, K, Rb and Cs), as well as the validation of our theory have been discussed.

Title: Increasing the clock speed of a thermodynamic computer by adding noise
Authors: Stephen Whitelam
Abstract: We describe a proposal for increasing the effective clock speed of a thermodynamic computer, by altering the interaction scale of the units within the computer and introducing to the computer an additional source of noise. The resulting thermodynamic computer program is equivalent to the original computer program, but runs at a higher clock speed. This approach offers a way of increasing the speed of thermodynamic computing while preserving the fidelity of computation.

Title: Nonlinear Hall effects with an exceptional ring
Authors: Fang Qin, Ruizhe Shen, Ching Hua Lee
Abstract: In non-Hermitian band structures, exceptional points generically form gapless lines or loops that give rise to extensively many defective eigenstates. In this work, we investigate how they nontrivially contribute to higher-order nonlinear responses by introducing unique singularities in the Berry curvature dipole (BCD) or Berry connection polarizability (BCP). Using a tilted two-dimensional dissipative Dirac model ansatz that harbors an exceptional ring, broken inversion symmetry is shown to give rise to extrinsic (BCD) and intrinsic (BCP) nonlinear Hall behaviors unique to systems with extensive exceptional singularities. In particular, when the non-Hermiticity is increased while keeping the ring radius fixed, the BCD response exhibits a power-law increase, while the BCP response correspondingly decreases. Our work sheds light on how non-Hermiticity can qualitatively control the extent and nature of higher harmonic generation in solids.

Title: Evidence of orbital Hall current induced correlation in second harmonic response of longitudinal and transverse voltage in light metal-ferromagnet bilayers
Authors: Dhananjaya Mahapatra, Abu Bakkar Miah, HareKrishna Bhunia, Soumik Aon, Partha Mitra
Abstract: We investigate the effect of orbital current arising from orbital Hall effect in thin films of Nb and Ti in ohmic contact with ferromagnetic Ni in the second harmonic longitudinal and transverse voltages in response to an a.c. current applied to the bilayer structures. Our experiments were analogous to those on Heavy Metal-Ferromagnet bilayers and we extract the Orbital Hall Torque efficiency and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR). Through second-harmonic measurements, we investigate orbital Hall torque and UMR in bilayer devices composed of ferromagnetic materials (FM), such as Ni and NiFe, paired with light metals (LM), such as Ti and Nb. Our results demonstrate that LM/Ni bilayers exhibit enhanced damping-like torque and unidirectional magnetoresistance (UMR) compared to LM/NiFe bilayers. This enhancement suggests that angular momentum is generated via the orbital Hall effect within the light metal, where it undergoes orbital-to-spin conversion within the Ni ferromagnet, ultimately transferring to the magnetization of the ferromagnetic layer. Torque and UMR are also absent in single-layer devices, highlighting the necessity of the bilayer structure for orbital current generation.

Title: Fluctuations of driven probes reveal nonequilibrium transitions in complex fluids
Authors: Danilo Forastiere, Emanuele Locatelli, Gianmaria Falasco, Enzo Orlandini, Marco Baiesi
Abstract: Complex fluids subjected to localized microscopic energy inputs, typical of active microrheology setups, exhibit poorly understood nonequilibrium behaviors because of the intricate self-organization of their mesoscopic constituents. In this work we show how to identify changes in the microstructural conformation of the fluid by monitoring the variance of the probe position, based on a general method grounded in the breakdown of the equipartition theorem. To illustrate our method, we perform large-scale Brownian dynamics simulations of an effective model of micellar solution, and we link the different scaling regimes in the variance of the probe's position to the transitions from diffusive to jump dynamics, where the fluid intermittently relaxes the accumulated stress. This suggests stored elastic stress may be the physical mechanism behind the nonlinear friction curves recently measured in micellar solutions, pointing at a mechanism for the observed multi-step rheology. Our approach overcomes the limitations of continuum macroscopic descriptions and introduces an empirical method, applicable in experiments, to detect nonequilibrium transitions in the structure of complex fluids.

Title: Nonequilibrium Fluctuation-Response Relations for State Observables
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Time-integrated state observables, which quantify the fraction of time spent by the system in a specific pool of states, are important in many fields, such as chemical sensing or the theory of fluorescence spectroscopy. We derive exact identities, called Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs), that connect the fluctuations of such observables to their response to external perturbations in nonequilibrium steady state of Markov jump processes. Using these results, we derive novel upper and lower bounds for fluctuations. We further demonstrate their applicability for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, use them to explain the physical origin of positive and negative correlations of occupation times in a double quantum dot device, and discuss their relevance for model inference.

Title: Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in PbTe and SnTe: impact of the host band symmetry on doping properties by ab initio calculations
Authors: A. Łusakowski, P. Bogusławski, T. Story
Abstract: Doping properties of Bi, Cr and Ag dopants in thermoelectric and topological materials PbTe and SnTe are analyzed based on density functional theory calculations in the local density approximations and the large supercell method. In agreement with experiment, in both PbTe and SnTe, Bi is a donor and Ag is an acceptor with a vanishing magnetic moment. In contrast, Cr is a resonant donor in PbTe, and an resonant acceptor in SnTe. We also consider the electronic structure of cation vacancies in PbTe and SnTe, since these abundant native defects induce $p$-type conductivity in both hosts. The quantitatively different impact of these dopants/defects on the host band structure of PbTe and SnTe (level energies, band splittings, band inversion, and a different level of hybridization between dopant and host states) is explained based on the group-theoretical arguments.

Title: Seed-Driven Stepwise Crystallization (SDSC) for Growing Rutile GeO2 Films via MOCVD
Authors: Imteaz Rahaman, Botong Li, Bobby Duersch, Hunter D. Ellis, Kai Fu
Abstract: Germanium dioxide (r-GeO2) is an emerging new ultrawide bandgap (UWBG) semiconductor with significant potential for power electronics, thanks to its large-size substrate compatibility and ambipolar doping capability. However, phase segregation during metal-organic chemical vapor deposition (MOCVD) on substrates like r-TiO2 has posed a significant barrier to achieving high-quality films. Conventional optimization of growth parameters has been found so far not very insufficient in film coverage and film quality. To address this, a seed-driven stepwise crystallization (SDSC) growth approach was employed in this study, featuring multiple sequential deposition steps on a pre-templated substrate enriched with r-GeO2 seeds. The process began with an initial 180-minute deposition to establish r-GeO2 nucleation seeds, followed by a sequence of shorter deposition steps (90, 60, 60, 60, 60, and 60 minutes). This stepwise growth strategy progressively increased the crystalline coverage to 57.4%, 77.49%, 79.73%, 93.27%, 99.17%, and ultimately 100%. Concurrently, the crystalline quality improved substantially, evidenced by a ~30% reduction in the Full Width at Half Maximum (FWHM) of X-ray diffraction rocking curves. These findings demonstrate the potential of the SDSC approach for overcoming phase segregation and achieving high-quality, large-area r-GeO2 films.

Title: Landau-level composition of bound exciton states in magnetic field
Authors: Dinh Van Tuan, Hanan Dery
Abstract: We present a theory that studies the state composition of a bound exciton in magnetic field. Using a basis set made of products of free electron and hole wavefunctions in Landau gauge, we derive a secular equation which shows the relation between Landau levels (LLs) of the electron and hole when a bound exciton is formed. Focusing on excitons in the light cone, we establish a scattering selection rule for the interaction of an electron in LL $n_\text{e}$ with a hole in LL $n_\text{h}$. We solve the resulting secular equation and identify a simple pairing law, $n_\text{e} = n_\text{h} + l$, which informs us on the construction of a bound exciton state with magnetic quantum number $l$, and on the interaction of the exciton magnetic moment with magnetic field. We obtain good agreement between theory results and recent measurements of the diamagnetic shifts of exciton states in WSe$_2$ monolayers.

Title: Strain-induced proximity effect in topological insulator TaSe$_3$
Authors: R.M. Lukmanova, I.A. Cohn, V.E. Minakova, S.V. Zaitsev-Zotov
Abstract: The magnetoresistance of superconductor-topological insulator-superconductor structures, with indium as the superconductor and TaSe$_3$ as the topological insulator, shows steplike features on the resistance under magnetic fields. These resistance steps are resulted from the suppression of superconductivity, induced by the superconducting proximity effect in both the bulk and surface states of the topological insulator. The position and amplitude of the steps, occurring at approximately 0.1 T, show an unusual dependence on the magnitude of the uniaxial strain ($\epsilon$), indicating their connection with surface states. This behavior follows the expected transition sequence: semi-metal $\rightarrow$ strong topological insulator $\rightarrow$ trivial insulator, and supports the presence of surface states at $0.46\% \lesssim \epsilon \lesssim 0.85\%$.

Title: Finite-Temperature Kinetic Ferromagnetism in the Square Lattice Hubbard Model
Authors: Robin C. Newby, Ehsan Khatami
Abstract: While the exact phase diagram of the Fermi-Hubbard model remains poorly understood despite decades of progress, nearly 60 years ago, Nagaoka proved that a single dopant in an otherwise half-filled Hubbard system can bring about ferromagnetism through kinetic means. The phenomenon was recently observed with ultracold atoms in triangular optical lattices. Here, we explore the kinetic ferromagnetism within the square lattice Hubbard model and its strong-coupling counterpart, the $t-J$ model, at finite temperatures in the thermodynamic limit via numerical linked-cluster expansions. We find evidence of ferromagnetic Nagaoka polarons at dopings up to $\sim 30\%$ away from half filling for a variety of interaction strengths and at temperatures as low as $0.2$ of the hopping energy. We map out the boundaries of this phase through analyzing various correlation functions.

Title: The Augmented Potential Method: Multiscale Modeling Toward a Spectral Defect Genome
Authors: Nutth Tuchinda, Changle Li, Christopher A. Schuh
Abstract: The modeling of solute chemistry at low-symmetry defects in materials is historically challenging, due to the computation cost required to evaluate thermodynamic properties from first principles. Here, we offer a hybrid multiscale approach called the augmented potential method that connects the chemical flexibility and near-quantum accuracy of a universal machine learning potential at the site of the defect, with the computational speed of a long-range classical potential implemented away from the defect site in a buffer zone. The method allows us to rapidly compute distributions of grain boundary segregation energy for 1,050 binary alloy pairs (including Ag, Al, Au, Cr, Cu, Fe, Mo, Nb, Ni, Pd, Pt, Ta and V, W solvent), creating a database for polycrystalline grain boundary segregation. This database is ~5x larger than previously published spectral compilations, and yet has improved accuracy. The approach can also address problems far beyond the reach of any other method, such as handling bcc Fe-based alloys, or the complex solute-solute interactions in random polycrystals. The approach thus paves a pathway toward a complete defect genome in crystalline materials.

Title: Phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of the structurally chiral superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C
Authors: Shangfei Wu, Xianghan Xu, Fei-Ting Huang, Turan Birol, Sang-Wook Cheong, Girsh Blumberg
Abstract: We employ polarization-resolved Raman spectroscopy to study the lattice dynamics of the polar charge density wave phase of the superconductor Mo$_3$Al$_2$C with structural chirality. We show the phononic signatures of the charge density wave transition at $T^*$ = 155\,K in Mo$_3$Al$_2$C. The detailed temperature dependence of these phonon modes' frequency, half width at half maximum, and integrated area below $T^*$ reveal anomalies at an intermediate temperature $T' \sim$ 100\,K, especially for the low-energy modes at 130 and 180\,\cm-1. We discuss the origin of these phonon anomalies within the polar charge density wave phase of Mo$_3$Al$_2$C.

Title: Stress-stress correlations in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids
Authors: Jimin Bai, Long-Zhou Huang, Jin Shang, Yun-Jiang Wang, Jie Zhang, Matteo Baggioli
Abstract: Stress-stress correlations in crystalline solids with long-range order can be straightforwardly derived using elasticity theory. In contrast, the `emergent elasticity' of amorphous solids, rigid materials characterized by an underlying disordered structure, defies direct explanation within traditional theoretical frameworks. To address this challenge, tensor gauge theories have been recently proposed as a promising approach to describe the emergent elasticity of disordered solids and predict their stress-stress correlations. In this work, we revisit this problem in two-dimensional amorphous and crystalline solids by employing a canonical elasticity theory approach, supported by experimental and simulation data. We demonstrate that, with respect to static stress-stress correlations, the response of a 2D disordered solid is indistinguishable from that of a 2D isotropic crystalline solid and it is well predicted by vanilla elasticity theory. Moreover, we show that the presence of pinch-point singularities in the stress response is not an exclusive feature of amorphous solids. Our results confirm previous observations about the universal character of static stress-stress correlations in crystalline and amorphous packings.

Title: Josephson effect and critical currents in trivial and topological full-shell hybrid nanowires
Authors: Carlos Payá, Ramón Aguado, Pablo San-Jose, Elsa Prada
Abstract: We perform microscopic numerical simulations of the Josephson effect through short junctions between two full-shell hybrid nanowires, comprised of a semiconductor core fully wrapped by a thin superconductor shell, both in the trivial and topological regimes. We explore the behavior of the current-phase relation and the critical current $I_c$ as a function of a threading flux for different models of the semiconductor core and different transparencies of the weak link. We find that $I_c$ is modulated with flux due to the Little-Parks (LP) effect and displays a characteristic skewness towards large fluxes within non-zero LP lobes, which is inherited from the skewness of a peculiar kind of subgap states known as Caroli-de Gennes-Matricon (CdGM) analogs. The appearance of Majorana zero modes at the junction in the topological phase is revealed in $I_c$ as fin-shaped peaks that stand out from the background at low junction transparencies. The competition between CdGMs of opposite electron- and hole-like character produces steps and dips in $I_c$. A rich phenomenology results, which includes 0-, $\pi$- and $\phi$-junction behaviors depending on the charge distribution across the wire core and the junction transparency.

Title: Neuromorphic Computing with Microfluidic Memristors
Authors: Nex C. X. Stuhlmüller, René van Roij, Marjolein Dijkstra
Abstract: Conical microfluidic channels filled with electrolytes exhibit volatile memristive behavior, offering a promising platform for energy-efficient, neuromorphic computing. Here, we integrate these iontronic channels as additional nonlinear elements in nonlinear Shinriki-inspired oscillators and demonstrate that they exhibit alternating chaotic and non-chaotic dynamics across a broad frequency range. Exploiting this behavior, we construct XOR and NAND gates by coupling three Memriki oscillators, and we further realize the full set of standard logic gates through combinations of NAND gates. Our results establish a new paradigm for iontronic computing and open avenues for scalable, low-power logical operations in microfluidic and bio-inspired systems.

Title: Circular dichroism in resonant photoelectron diffraction as a direct probe of sublattice magnetization in altermagnets
Authors: Peter Krüger
Abstract: Altermagnets are a new class of magnetic materials that are promising for spintronics technology. Here it is shown that in altermagnets, the circular dichroism (CD) in resonant photoelectron diffraction (RPED) contains a time-reversal odd signal, which provides a direct probe of the sublattice magnetization. RPED calculations are performed for MnTe at the Mn L2,3-edge resonance, using a combination of atomic multiplet and multiple scattering theory. A large magnetic CD is found for light helicity parallel to the Néel vector. This signal has the same angular distribution as the difference between the structural RPED of the two magnetic sublattices and its amplitude is approximately proportional to the X-ray magnetic CD in absorption of a single sublattice, thus providing a direct probe of the local magnetic moments.

Title: Best practices in Quantum Monte Carlo for metal catalysis: CO hydrolysis on Pt(111)
Authors: Ali Bagci, Philip E Hoggan
Abstract: Hydrogen production as a clean, sustainable replacement for fossil fuels is gathering pace. Research work and prototyping various aspects of hydrogen power is now a priority. Over 90 \% of all chemical manufacture uses a solid catalyst. This work describes catalytic selective hydrogen production optimising reactant structure on a model catalyst. Focus is on O-H bond dissociation in format radicals formed after carbon-monoxide is co-adsorbed with water at Pt(111). Finally, hydrogen gas is given off. Many chemical reactions involve bond-dissociation. This process is often the key to rate-limiting reaction steps at solid surfaces. %This is also true for reactions at solid surfaces, in which the dissociation step is often limiting but facilitated in comparison to gas phase reaction channels. Since bond-breaking is poorly described by Hartree-Fock and DFT methods, our embedded active site approach is used. This work demonstrates Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) methodology using a very simple four primitive-cell layer model, oriented to expose Pt (111). QMC is a stochastic approach to solving the Schr{ö}dinger equation recently came of age for heterogeneous systems involving solids. During hydrolysis of carbon monoxide, initial O-H bond stretch is rate-limiting. This dissociation energy is offset by Pt-H bond formation at the surface. The reactive formate (H-O-C=O) species formed, by initial hydrolysis of CO, also interact with a vicinal Pt. These are subsequently desorbed. They then produce carbon dioxide and hydrogen, with a H-atom dissociated from the formate species and another desorbed at the Pt(111) face. Our approach allows a high-level configuration interaction (CI) wave-function to be used, expanded in plane-waves and embedded in the metal lattice exposing its close-packed face. The resulting periodic function is used to guide the QMC calculation.

Title: Proper Orthogonal Decomposition of a Superfluid Turbulent Wake
Authors: Sota Yoneda, Hiromitsu Takeuchi
Abstract: Superfluid turbulent wakes behind a square prism are studied theoretically and numerically by proper orthogonal decomposition (POD). POD is a data science approach that can efficiently extract the principal vibration modes of a physical system, and is widely used in hydrodynamics, including applications in wake structure analysis. It is not straightforward to apply the conventional POD method to superfluid wake systems, as the superfluid velocity field diverges at the center of a vortex whose circulation is quantized. We successfully established a POD method by applying appropriate blurring to the vorticity distribution in a two-dimensional superfluid wake. It is shown that a coherent structure corresponding to two parallel arrays of alternating quantum vortex bundles, called the "quasi-classical" Kármán vortex street, is latent as a distinctive major mode in the superfluid turbulent wakes that were naively thought to be "irregular". Since our method is also effective for fluid density, it can be applied to the experimental data analysis for ultra-cold atomic gases.

Title: Realizing high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular-hydrogen through Li doping
Authors: Ashok K. Verma, P. Modak
Abstract: In this study, we explore lithium-doped stable molecular hydrogen structures by performing first-principles crystal structure searches across varying compositions in the Li-H system under high pressure. Our search reveals a cubic phase of LiH12, which shows promise as a high-temperature superconductor. Our Bader charge analysis suggests that electron transfer from Li to H atoms tunes the intra- and inter-molecular H-H distances, which are critical for the metallization of molecular hydrogen. This modulation alters the interaction between bonding and anti-bonding 1s states of hydrogen molecules. Furthermore, Li ions serve as stabilizers for the distorted H2 molecular network through ionic interactions. Numerical solutions to the fully anisotropic Migdal-Eliashberg equations reveals that this phase could exhibit superconductivity above 300 K at a pressure of 250 GPa, a pressure value that is typically achievable using a diamond anvil cell. Detailed analysis of species-specific phonons and the Eliashberg function shows that low- and intermediate-energy phonons are crucial in promoting strong electron-phonon coupling. Thus, our study establishes lithium doping as a promising approach to induce high-temperature superconductivity in compressed molecular hydrogen without causing molecular dissociation.

Title: Spectroscopy and Ground-State Transfer of Ultracold Bosonic $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs Molecules
Authors: Krzysztof P. Zamarski, Charly Beulenkamp, Yi Zeng, Manuele Landini, Hanns-Christoph Nägerl
Abstract: We report the creation of ultracold samples of $^{39}$K$^{133}$Cs molecules in their rovibrational ground state. By investigating potentially suitable excited states using one- and two-photon spectroscopy, we have identified a pathway to the ground state via an exceptionally narrow intermediate state. Using Stimulated Raman Adiabatic Passage (STIRAP), we create trapped samples of up to 3500 molecules at temperatures of 1 $\mu$K with one-way efficiencies of 71%. The lifetime of these samples is limited by a near-universal two-body loss process, which could shed new light on similar loss mechanisms in other molecular species. Our results are a step towards establishing an alternative platform for the study of bosonic and fermionic quantum matter with strong dipolar interactions.

Title: Anyon delocalization transitions out of a disordered FQAH insulator
Authors: Zhengyan Darius Shi, T. Senthil
Abstract: Motivated by the experimental discovery of the fractional quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) effect, we develop a theory of doping-induced transitions out of the $\nu = 2/3$ lattice Jain state in the presence of quenched disorder. We show that disorder strongly affects the evolution into the conducting phases described in our previous work. The delocalization of charge $2/3$ anyons leads to a chiral topological superconductor through a direct second order transition for a smooth random potential with long-wavelength modulations. The longitudinal resistance has a universal peak at the associated quantum critical point. Close to the transition, we show that the superconducting ground state is an ``Anomalous Vortex Glass (AVG)'' stabilized in the absence of an external magnetic field. For short-wavelength disorder, this transition generically splits into three distinct ones with intermediate insulating topological phases. If instead, the charge $1/3$ anyon delocalizes, then at low doping the result is a Reentrant Integer Quantum Hall state with $\rho_{xy} = h/e^2$. At higher doping this undergoes a second transition to a Fermi liquid metal. We show that this framework provides a plausible explanation for the complex phase diagram recently observed in twisted MoTe$_2$ near $\nu = 2/3$ and discuss future experiments that can test our theory in more detail.

Title: Three-Majorana Cotunneling Interferometer for Non-Abelian Braiding and Topological Quantum Gate Implementation
Authors: Zhen Chen, Yijia Wu, X. C. Xie
Abstract: We propose a novel scheme for performing Majorana zero mode (MZM) braiding utilizing cotunneling processes in a three-MZM system incorporating reference arms. This approach relies on the interference between cotunneling paths through the MZMs and reference arms, establishing an effective, tunable coupling between the MZMs. The strength and sign of this coupling can be manipulated via the reference arms and applied magnetic flux. Notably, the introduction of a half quantum flux reverses the coupling sign, enabling an echo-like protocol to eliminate dynamic phases during braiding. Our setup, requiring only three MZMs, represents a minimal platform for demonstrating non-Abelian braiding statistics. We demonstrate that this system facilitates the implementation of Clifford gates via braiding and, significantly, permits the realization of non-Clifford gates, such as the $T$ gate, by geometric phase, thereby offering a potential pathway towards universal topological quantum computation.

Title: All-electrically controlled spintronics in altermagnetic heterostructures
Authors: Pei-Hao Fu, Qianqian Lv, Yong Xu, Jorge Cayao, Jun-Feng Liu, Xiang-Long Yu
Abstract: The recent development of altermagnetic materials, supporting spin splitting without net magnetization, opens new directions for spintronics that are fundamentally distinct from conventional ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, or spin-orbit coupling systems. Here we investigate spin-selective quantum transport in heterostructures composed of a normal metal and a two-dimensional $d$-wave altermagnet. We focus on two types of $d$-wave altermagnets, namely, weak and strong altermagnets that support close elliptic and open hyperbolic spin-resolved Fermi surfaces, respectively. Building on these distinct electronic structures, we propose all-electrically controlled spin filter and spin valve devices, where quantum resonant tunneling enables highly spin-polarized conductance tunable via gate voltage and interface transparency. In particular, we find that strong altermagnets allow gate-tunable full spin polarization that is robust against interface scattering and can be reversed by gate control. We further demonstrate that a double-gated spin valve electrically switches between parallel and antiparallel spin configurations, analogous to magnetic junctions but without the need for external magnetic fields. Our results establish both weak and strong altermagnets as promising platforms for realizing magnetic-field-free electrically tunable spintronic functionalities.

Title: Dynamical thermalization, Rayleigh-Jeans condensate, vortexes and wave collapse in quantum chaos fibers and fluid of light
Authors: Leonardo Ermann, Alexei D. Chepelianskii, Dima L. Shepelyansky
Abstract: We study analytically and numerically the time evolution of a nonlinear field described by the nonlinear Schrödinger equation in a chaotic $D$-shape billiard. In absence of nonlinearity the system has standard properties of quantum chaos. This model describes a longitudinal light propagation in a multimode D-shape optical fiber and also those in a Kerr nonlinear medium of atomic vapor. We show that, above a certain chaos border of nonlinearity, chaos leads to dynamical thermalization with the Rayleigh-Jeans thermal distribution and the formation of the Rayleigh-Jeans condensate in a vicinity of the ground state accumulating in it about 80-90\% of total probability. Certain similarities of this phenomenon with the Fröhlich condensate are discussed. Below the chaos border the dynamics is quasi-integrable corresponding to the Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser integrability. The evolution to the thermal state is characterized by an unusual entropy time dependence with an increase on short times and later significant decrease when approaching to the steady-state. This behavior is opposite to the Boltzmann H-theorem and is attributed to the formation of Rayleigh-Jeans condensate and presence of two integrals of motion, energy and norm. At a strong focusing nonlinearity we show that the wave collapse can take place even at sufficiently high positive energy being very different from the open space case. Finally for the defocusing case we establish the superfluid regime for vortex dynamics at strong nonlinearity. System parameters for optical fiber experimental studies of these effects are also discussed.

Title: What Really Drives Thermopower: Specific Heat or Entropy as the Unifying Principle Across Magnetic, Superconducting, and Nanoscale Systems
Authors: Morteza Jazandari, Jahanfar Abouie, Daryoosh Vashaee
Abstract: Thermopower, a key parameter in thermoelectric performance, is often linked to either specific heat or entropy, yet the fundamental quantity that governs it has remained elusive. In this work, we present a unified theoretical framework that identifies entropy per carrier, not specific heat, as the universal driver of thermopower across both closed and open systems. Using thermodynamic identities and the Onsager-Kelvin relation, we show that thermopower is universally proportional to entropy per carrier, while its apparent proportionality to specific heat arises only in systems where the specific heat follows a continuous power-law temperature dependence. To extend this framework to magnetic systems, we derive a general expression for magnon-drag thermopower that holds in both Newtonian (massive, parabolic) and relativistic (massless, linear) magnon regimes. In particular, we reformulate the momentum balance using a relativistic energy-momentum tensor, resolving conceptual inconsistencies in prior models that relied on ill-defined magnon masses in antiferromagnets. Our framework is further illustrated through three representative systems: (i) magnetic materials, where magnon and paramagnon entropy sustain thermopower across TC and TN; (ii) superconducting Nb, where anomalous thermopower emerges from entropy carried by Bogoliubov quasiparticles near TC; and (iii) a single-molecule junction, where entropy from occupation-number fluctuations governs thermopower in an open quantum system. We validate our unifying principle by comparing it with experimental data: thermopower measurements of superconducting niobium reveal the role of quasiparticle entropy near the critical temperature, and literature-reported specific heat data from a wide range of ferromagnetic and antiferromagnetic materials demonstrate consistent entropy-based scaling across magnetic transitions.

Title: Diffusion properties of small-scale fractional transport models
Authors: Paolo Cifani, Franco Flandoli
Abstract: Stochastic transport due to a velocity field modeled by the superposition of small-scale divergence free vector fields activated by Fractional Gaussian Noises (FGN) is numerically investigated. We present two non-trivial contributions: the first one is the definition of a model where different space-time structures can be compared on the same ground: this is achieved by imposing the same average kinetic energy to a standard Ornstein-Uhlenbeck approximation, then taking the limit to the idealized white noise structure. The second contribution, based on the previous one, is the discover that a mixing spatial structure with persistent FGN in the Fourier components induces a classical Brownian diffusion of passive particles, with suitable diffusion coefficient; namely, the memory of FGN is lost in the space complexity of the velocity field.

Title: Spin-split superconductivity in spin-orbit coupled hybrid nanowires with ferromagnetic barriers
Authors: J. Zhao, A. Mazanik, D. Razmadze, Y. Liu, P. Krogstrup, F. S. Bergeret, S. Vaitiekėnas
Abstract: We report transport studies of hybrid Josephson junctions based on semiconducting InAs nanowires with fully overlapping epitaxial ferromagnetic insulator EuS and superconducting Al partial shells. Current-biased measurements reveal a hysteretic superconducting window with a sizable supercurrent near the coercive field of the ferromagnetic insulator, accompanied by multiple Andreev reflections. Tunneling spectroscopy shows a superconducting gap characterized by three peaks, which we attribute to tunneling between exchange-split superconductors. A theoretical model reproduces the observed features and indicates that spin mixing, driven by sizable spin-orbit coupling, is essential to their formation. Our results demonstrate proximity-induced superconductivity through a ferromagnetic insulator and establish a new platform for exploring spin-triplet pairing.

Title: Bound States at Semiconductor -- Mott Insulator Interfaces
Authors: Jan Verlage, Peter Kratzer
Abstract: Utilizing the hierarchy of correlations in the context of a Fermi-Hubbard model, we deduce the presence of quasi-particle bound states at the interface between a Mott insulator and a semiconductor, as well as within a semiconductor-Mott-semiconductor heterostructure forming a quantum well. In the case of the solitary interface, the existence of bound states necessitates the presence of an additional perturbation with a minimal strength depending on the spin background of the Mott insulator. Conversely, within the quantum well, this additional perturbation is still required to have bound states while standing-wave solutions even exist in its absence.

Title: Ultrafast interband transitions in nanoporous gold metamaterial
Authors: Tlek Tapani, Jonas M. Pettersson, Nils Henriksson, Erik Zäll, Nils V. Hauff, Lakshmi Das, Gianluca Balestra, Massimo Cuscunà, Aitor De Andrés, Tommaso Giovannini, Denis Garoli, Nicolò Maccaferri
Abstract: Nanoporous metals have emerged as promising functional architectures due to their tunable optical and electronic properties, high surface areas, and versatile use in real-life applications such as sensing, catalysis, and biomedicine. While the optical and morphological properties of nanoporous metals have been extensively studied, their electronic properties at ultrafast timescales remain largely unexplored. Here, we study the transient response of a nanoporous gold metamaterial and compare it with the ultrafast dynamics of a continuous gold film. We unravel that the nanoporous sample supports lower energy interband transitions, due to a much higher electron temperature in the nanoporous material, which causes an enhanced redistribution of electron density around the Fermi level. The experimental results are consistent with the two-temperature model, which highlights the role of nanoscale porosity in enabling the more efficient generation of hot carriers, thus allowing lower energy photons to induce interband transitions. Our findings demonstrate that nanoporosity affects fundamental ultrafast electronic processes and introduces this platform as temporal metamaterial allowing the emergence of tunable electronic properties not supported by the bulk counterpart. Furthermore, we present new insights into ultrafast electronic properties of nanoporous metals, which can impact several areas, from photochemistry and catalysis to energy harvesting and opto-electronics.

Title: Packing3D: An Open-Source Analytical Framework for Computing Packing Density and Mixing Indices Using Partial Spherical Volumes
Authors: Freddie Barter, Christopher R. K. Windows-Yule
Abstract: Accurate quantification of local packing density and mixing in simulations of particulate systems is essential for many industrial applications. Traditional methods which simply count the number of particle centres within a given volume of space (cell) introduce discontinuities at cell boundaries, leading to unreliable measurement of packing density. We introduce Packing3D, an open-source Julia package providing analytic, partial-volume calculations for spheres intersecting Cartesian and cylindrical meshes. Our goals were to (1) eliminate boundary-artifact jumps, (2) maintain high throughput on large datasets, and (3) deliver standard mixing metrics via a unified API. We derive closed-form solutions for single, double and triple spherical-cap intersections, plus sphere-cylinder overlaps. A short-circuit bounding-sphere test shortens computations: fully inside or outside spheres are handled in $\mathcal{O}(1)$ time, and only near-boundary spheres invoke the analytic kernels. We implement efficient mesh-generation routines, principal-cell indexing, and data-splitting functions for time-series analyses. Performance and accuracy were validated against simple cubic and face-centered cubic lattices and via boundary-shift continuity tests. Packing3D converges exactly to theoretical lattice densities, eliminates discontinuities at sub-particle resolution, and processes up to $10^8$ sphere-cell intersections per second in single-threaded Julia with linear scaling in particle count. Memory usage remains modest (40 B per particle, 48 B per cell). Packing3D provides researchers with continuous, reproducible volume-fraction fields and robust mixing indices at high performance, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimisation in granular process engineering.

Title: Nonequilibrium fluctuation-response relations for state-current correlations
Authors: Krzysztof Ptaszynski, Timur Aslyamov, Massimiliano Esposito
Abstract: Recently, novel exact identities known as Fluctuation-Response Relations (FRRs) have been derived for nonequilibrium steady states of Markov jump processes. These identities link the fluctuations of state or current observables to a combination of responses of these observables to perturbations of transition rates. Here, we complement these results by deriving analogous FRRs applicable to mixed covariances of one state and one current observable. We further derive novel Inverse FRRs expressing individual state or current response in terms of a combination of covariances rather than vice versa. Using these relations, we demonstrate that the breaking of the Onsager symmetry can occur only in the presence of state-current correlations. On the practical side, we demonstrate the applicability of FRRs for simplifying calculations of fluctuations in large Markov networks, we use them to explain the behavior of fluctuations in quantum dot devices or enzymatic reaction schemes, and discuss their potential relevance for model inference.

Title: Experimental evidence of the topological obstruction in twisted bilayer graphene
Authors: F. Mesple, P. Mallet, G. Trambly de Laissardière, C. Dutreix, G. Lapertot, J-Y. Veuillen, V. T. Renard
Abstract: The rich physics of magic angle twisted bilayer graphene (TBG) results from the Coulomb interactions of electrons in flat bands of non-trivial topology. While the bands' dispersion is well characterized, accessing their topology remains an experimental challenge. Recent measurements established the local density of states (LDOS) as a topological observable. Here, we use scanning tunnelling microscopy to investigate the LDOS of TBG near a defect. We observe characteristic patterns resulting from the Dirac cones having the same chirality within a moiré valley. At higher energies, we observe the Lifshitz transition associated with the Dirac cones mixing. Our measurements provide a full characterization of TBG's band structure, confirming the main features of the continuum model including the renormalization of the Fermi velocity, the role of emergent symmetries and the topological obstruction of the wavefunctions.

Title: Second-Order Coherence Across the Brillouin Lasing Threshold
Authors: E. A. Cryer-Jenkins, G. Enzian, L. Freisem, N. Moroney, J. J. Price, A. Ø. Svela, K. D. Major, M. R. Vanner
Abstract: Brillouin-Mandelstam scattering is one of the most accessible nonlinear optical phenomena and has been widely studied since its theoretical discovery one hundred years ago. The scattering mechanism is a three-wave-mixing process between two optical fields and one acoustic field and has found a broad range of applications spanning microscopy to ultra-narrow-linewidth lasers. Building on the success of utilizing this nonlinearity at a classical level, a rich avenue is now being opened to explore Brillouin scattering within the paradigm of quantum optics. Here, we take a key step in this direction by employing quantum optical techniques yet to be utilized for Brillouin scattering to characterize the second-order coherence of Stokes scattering across the Brillouin lasing threshold. We use a silica microsphere resonator and single-photon counters to observe the expected transition from bunched statistics of thermal light below the lasing threshold to Poissonian statistics of coherent light above the threshold. Notably, at powers approaching the lasing threshold, we also observe super-thermal statistics, which arise due to instability and a "flickering" in and out of lasing as the pump field is transiently depleted. The statistics observed across the transition, including the "flickering", are a result of the full nonlinear three-wave-mixing process and cannot be captured by a linearized model. These measurements are in good agreement with numerical solutions of the three-wave Langevin equations and are well demarcated by analytical expressions for the instability and the lasing thresholds. These results demonstrate that applying second-order-coherence and photon-counting measurements to Brillouin scattering provides new methods to advance our understanding of Brillouin scattering itself and progress toward quantum-state preparation and characterization of acoustic modes.

Title: Accurate neural quantum states for interacting lattice bosons
Authors: Zakari Denis, Giuseppe Carleo
Abstract: In recent years, neural quantum states have emerged as a powerful variational approach, achieving state-of-the-art accuracy when representing the ground-state wave function of a great variety of quantum many-body systems, including spin lattices, interacting fermions or continuous-variable systems. However, accurate neural representations of the ground state of interacting bosons on a lattice have remained elusive. We introduce a neural backflow Jastrow Ansatz, in which occupation factors are dressed with translationally equivariant many-body features generated by a deep neural network. We show that this neural quantum state is able to faithfully represent the ground state of the 2D Bose-Hubbard Hamiltonian across all values of the interaction strength. We scale our simulations to lattices of dimension up to $20{\times}20$ while achieving the best variational energies reported for this model. This enables us to investigate the scaling of the entanglement entropy across the superfluid-to-Mott quantum phase transition, a quantity hard to extract with non-variational approaches.

Title: Scattering and Pairing by Exchange Interactions
Authors: J.-B. Bru, W. de Siqueira Pedra, A. Ramer dos Santos
Abstract: Quantum interactions exchanging different types of particles play a pivotal rôle in quantum many-body theory, but they are not sufficiently investigated from a mathematical perspective. Here, we consider a system made of two fermions and one boson, in order to study the effect of such an off-diagonal interaction term, having in mind the physics of cuprate superconductors. Additionally, our model also includes a generalized Hubbard interaction (i.e., a general local repulsion term for the fermions). Regarding pairing, exponentially localized dressed bound fermion pairs are shown to exist and their effective dispersion relation is studied in detail. Scattering properties of the system are derived for two channels: the unbound and bound pair channels. We give particular attention to the regime of very large on-site (Hubbard) repulsions, because this situation is relevant for cuprate superconductors.

Title: Space-time correlations in monitored kinetically constrained discrete-time quantum dynamics
Authors: Marcel Cech, María Cea, Mari Carmen Bañuls, Igor Lesanovsky, Federico Carollo
Abstract: State-of-the-art quantum simulators permit local temporal control of interactions and midcircuit readout. These capabilities open the way towards the exploration of intriguing nonequilibrium phenomena. We illustrate this with a kinetically constrained many-body quantum system that has a natural implementation on Rydberg quantum simulators. The evolution proceeds in discrete time and is generated by repeatedly entangling the system with an auxiliary environment that is monitored and reset after each time-step. Despite featuring an uncorrelated infinite-temperature average stationary state, the dynamics displays coexistence of fast and slow space-time regions in stochastic realizations of the system state. The time-record of measurement outcomes on the environment serves as natural probe for such dynamical heterogeneity, which we characterize using tools from large deviation theory. Our work establishes the large deviation framework for discrete-time open quantum many-body systems as a means to characterize complex dynamics and collective phenomena in quantum processors and simulators.

Title: Statistics of topological defects across a phase transition in a digital superconducting quantum processor
Authors: Oriel Kiss, Daniil Teplitskiy, Michele Grossi, Antonio Mandarino
Abstract: When a quantum phase transition is crossed within a finite time, critical slowing down disrupts adiabatic dynamics, resulting in the formation of topological defects. The average density of these defects scales with the quench rate, adhering to a universal power law as predicted by the Kibble-Zurek mechanism (KZM). In this study, we aim to investigate the counting statistics of kink density in the 1D transverse-field quantum Ising model. We demonstrate on multiple quantum processing units up to 100 qubits, that higher-order cumulants follow a universal power law scaling as a function of the quench time. We also show the breakdown of the KZM for short quenches for finite-size systems. Tensor network simulations corroborate our quantum simulation results for bigger systems not in the asymptotic limit.

Title: Learning the dynamics of Markovian open quantum systems from experimental data
Authors: Stewart Wallace, Yoann Altmann, Brian D. Gerardot, Erik M. Gauger, Cristian Bonato
Abstract: We present a Bayesian algorithm to identify generators of open quantum system dynamics, described by a Lindblad master equation, that are compatible with measured experimental data. The algorithm, based on a Markov Chain Monte Carlo approach, assumes the energy levels of the system are known and outputs a ranked list of interpretable master equation models that produce predicted measurement traces that closely match experimental data. We benchmark our algorithm on quantum optics experiments performed on single and pairs of quantum emitters. The latter case opens the possibility of cooperative emission effects and additional complexity due to the possible interplay between photon and phonon influences on the dynamics. Our algorithm retrieves various minimal models that are consistent with the experimental data, and which can provide a closer fit to measured data than previously suggested and physically expected approximate models. Our results represent an important step towards automated systems characterisation with an approach that is capable of working with diverse and tomographically incomplete input data. This may help with the development of theoretical models for unknown quantum systems as well as providing scientists with alternative interpretations of the data that they might not have originally envisioned and enabling them to challenge their original hypotheses.

Title: Multiparameter optimal control of F1-ATPase
Authors: W. Callum Wareham, David A. Sivak
Abstract: Biological molecular machines convert free energy between different forms in cells, often at high efficiency. Optimal control theory provides a framework to elucidate design principles governing energetically efficient driving. Here, we use linear-response theory to design efficient protocols exercising dynamic control of trap center and stiffness in a model of driven F1-ATPase. We find that the key design principles of an efficient protocol can be satisfied either by dynamic control of both parameters or by dynamic control of a single parameter and a good static choice for the second. These results illustrate that accessing a new degree of dynamic control provides varying performance improvements in different systems.

Title: The Aharonov-Casher Phase: Topological or Geometric?
Authors: Igor Kuzmenko, Y. B. Band, Yshai Avishai
Abstract: It is demonstrated that the Aharonov-Casher (AC) phase is a geometric phase that, in general, depends on the details of the closed path taken by a particle with a magnetic moment that is subject to an electric field. Consequently, it is not a topological phase. The proof of this statement is obtained by developing a counterexample that elucidates the dependence of the AC phase on the details of the path. Furthermore, we demonstrate that, in the particular example considered here, paths having an Abelian AC phase factor, also have an AC phase that is path-independent, whereas paths having a non-Abelian AC phase factor may have an AC phase that is path-dependent (i.e., not topological).

Title: Interface-sensitive microwave loss in superconducting tantalum films sputtered on c-plane sapphire
Authors: Anthony P. McFadden, Jinsu Oh, Lin Zhou, Trevyn F.Q. Larson, Stephen Gill, Akash V. Dixit, Raymond Simmonds, Florent Lecocq
Abstract: Quantum coherence in superconducting circuits has increased steadily over the last decades as a result of a growing understanding of the various loss mechanisms. Recently, tantalum (Ta) emerged as a promising material to address microscopic sources of loss found on niobium (Nb) or aluminum (Al) surfaces. However, the effects of film and interface microstructure on low-temperature microwave loss are still not well understood. Here we present a systematic study of the structural and electrical properties of Ta and Nb films sputtered on c-plane sapphire at varying growth temperatures. As growth temperature is increased, our results show that the onset of epitaxial growth of alpha-phase Ta correlates with lower Ta surface roughness, higher critical temperature, and higher residual resistivity ratio, but surprisingly also correlates with a significant increase in loss at microwave frequency. Notably, this high level of loss is not observed in Nb films prepared in the same way and having very similar structure. By experimentally controlling the surface on which the Ta film is nucleated, we determine that the source of loss is only present in samples having an epitaxial Ta/sapphire interface and show that it is apparently mitigated by either growing a thin, epitaxial Nb inter-layer between the Ta film and the substrate or by intentionally treating, and effectively damaging, the sapphire surface with an in-situ argon plasma before Ta growth. In addition to elucidating this interfacial microwave loss, this work provides adequate process details to aid reproducible growth of low-loss Ta films across fabrication facilities.

Title: Hall Angle of a Spatially Random Vector Model
Authors: Yi-Li Wang, Young-Kwon Han, Xian-Hui Ge, Sang-Jin Sin
Abstract: Strange metals exhibit linear resistivity and anomalous Hall transport, yet a comprehensive theory that accounts for both phenomena is still lacking. Recent studies have shown SYK-like spatially random couplings between a Fermi surface and a bosonic field, either scalar or vector type, can yield linear-$T$ resistivity. In this paper, we continue the investigation on a vector coupling in the presence of a magnetic field. We compute the fermion and boson propagators, along with the self-energy and polarization functions, and determine their dependence on the magnetic field. Although the Hall angle does not exhibit the signature of strange-metal, the linear-in-temperature resistivity remains at low temperatures. Results indicate that random interactions can robustly support linear transport, though additional ingredients may be required to capture the full phenomenology of strange metals.

Title: Metrological symmetries in singular quantum multi-parameter estimation
Authors: George Mihailescu, Saubhik Sarkar, Abolfazl Bayat, Steve Campbell, Andrew K. Mitchell
Abstract: The theoretical foundation of quantum sensing is rooted in the Cramér-Rao formalism, which establishes quantitative precision bounds for a given quantum probe. In many practical scenarios, where more than one parameter is unknown, the multi-parameter Cramér-Rao bound (CRB) applies. Since this is a matrix inequality involving the inverse of the quantum Fisher information matrix (QFIM), the formalism breaks down when the QFIM is singular. In this paper, we examine the physical origins of such singularities, showing that they result from an over-parametrization on the metrological level. This is itself caused by emergent metrological symmetries, whereby the same set of measurement outcomes are obtained for different combinations of system parameters. Although the number of effective parameters is equal to the number of non-zero QFIM eigenvalues, the Cramér-Rao formalism typically does not provide information about the effective parameter encoding. Instead, we demonstrate through a series of concrete examples that Bayesian estimation can provide deep insights. In particular, the metrological symmetries appear in the Bayesian posterior distribution as lines of persistent likelihood running through the space of unknown parameters. These lines are contour lines of the effective parameters which, through suitable parameter transformations, can be estimated and follow their own effective CRBs.

Title: Multi-Variable Batch Bayesian Optimization in Materials Research: Synthetic Data Analysis of Noise Sensitivity and Problem Landscape Effects
Authors: Imon Mia, Armi Tiihonen, Anna Ernst, Anusha Srivastava, Tonio Buonassisi, William Vandenberghe, Julia W.P. Hsu
Abstract: Bayesian Optimization (BO) machine learning method is increasingly used to guide experimental optimization tasks in materials science. To emulate the large number of input variables and noise-containing results in experimental materials research, we perform batch BO simulation of six design variables with a range of noise levels. Two test cases relevant for materials science problems are examined: a needle-in-a-haystack case (Ackley function) that may be encountered in, e.g., molecule optimizations, and a smooth landscape with a local optimum in addition to the global optimum (Hartmann function) that may be encountered in, e.g., material composition optimization. We show learning curves, performance metrics, and visualization to effectively track the optimization progression and evaluate how the optimization outcomes are affected by noise, batch-picking method, choice of acquisition function, and exploration hyperparameter values. We find that the effects of noise depend on the problem landscape: noise degrades the optimization results of a needle-in-a-haystack search (Ackley) dramatically more. However, with increasing noise, we observe an increasing probability of landing on the local optimum in Hartmann. Therefore, prior knowledge of the problem domain structure and noise level is essential when designing BO for materials research experiments. Synthetic data studies -- with known ground truth and controlled noise levels -- enable us to isolate and evaluate the impact of different batch BO components, {\it e.g.}, acquisition policy, objective metrics, and hyperparameter values, before transitioning to the inherent uncertainties of real experimental systems. The results and methodology of this study will facilitate a greater utilization of BO in guiding experimental materials research, specifically in settings with a large number of design variables to optimize.

Title: Universal path decomposition of transfer and scattering matrices
Authors: Joaquin Garcia-Suarez
Abstract: We report a universal identity: any entry of a one-dimensional transfer or scattering matrix comprising N layers equals a coherent sum of 2**(N-1) directed paths representing wave patterns with pre-defined amplitude and phase evolutions. Treating those paths as analytic building blocks, we derive closed-form results for arbitrary stratified media - optical, acoustic, elastic, or electronic - without resorting to matrix products or recursion. The combinatorial construction of paths turns layered system design into rule-based path engineering, illustrated with a design example that offers a reinterpretation of the quarter-wavelength principle. We also quantify the computational speed-up of the path method over classical transfer-matrix chaining and showcase two more cross-disciplinary applications (site-response seismology and quantum superlattices). This paradigm replaces numerical sweeps that employ the transfer matrix method with physically-transparent path-construction rules; its applicability spans across physical disciplines and scales: from nanometer optical coatings to kilometer-scale seismic strata.

Title: polyGen: A Learning Framework for Atomic-level Polymer Structure Generation
Authors: Ayush Jain, Rampi Ramprasad
Abstract: Synthetic polymeric materials underpin fundamental technologies in the energy, electronics, consumer goods, and medical sectors, yet their development still suffers from prolonged design timelines. Although polymer informatics tools have supported speedup, polymer simulation protocols continue to face significant challenges in the on-demand generation of realistic 3D atomic structures that respect conformational diversity. Generative algorithms for 3D structures of inorganic crystals, bio-polymers, and small molecules exist, but have not addressed synthetic polymers because of challenges in representation and dataset constraints. In this work, we introduce polyGen, the first generative model designed specifically for polymer structures from minimal inputs such as the repeat unit chemistry alone. polyGen combines graph-based encodings with a latent diffusion transformer using positional biased attention for realistic conformation generation. Given the limited dataset of 3,855 DFT-optimized polymer structures, we incorporate joint training with small molecule data to enhance generation quality. We also establish structure matching criteria to benchmark our approach on this novel problem. polyGen overcomes the limitations of traditional crystal structure prediction methods for polymers, successfully generating realistic and diverse linear and branched conformations, with promising performance even on challenging large repeat units. As the first atomic-level proof-of-concept capturing intrinsic polymer flexibility, it marks a new capability in material structure generation.

Title: Recovery dynamics of a gap-engineered transmon after a quasiparticle burst
Authors: Heekun Nho, Thomas Connolly, Pavel D. Kurilovich, Spencer Diamond, Charlotte G. L. Bøttcher, Leonid I. Glazman, Michel H. Devoret
Abstract: Ionizing radiation impacts create bursts of quasiparticle density in superconducting qubits. These bursts temporarily degrade qubit coherence which can be detrimental for quantum error correction. Here, we experimentally resolve quasiparticle bursts in 3D gap-engineered transmon qubits by continuously monitoring qubit transitions. Gap engineering allowed us to reduce the burst detection rate by a factor of a few. This reduction falls several orders of magnitude short of that expected if the quasiparticles were to quickly thermalize to the cryostat temperature. We associate the limited effect of gap engineering with the slow thermalization of the phonons in our chips after the burst.

Abstract: Machine learning models often require large datasets and struggle to generalize beyond their training distribution. These limitations pose significant challenges in scientific and engineering contexts, where generating exhaustive datasets is often impractical and the goal is frequently to discover novel solutions outside the training domain. In this work, we explore the use of dynamical data through a graph neural network-based simulator to enable efficient system-to-property learning and out-of-distribution prediction in the context of uniaxial compression of two-dimensional disordered elastic networks. We find that the simulator can learn the underlying physical dynamics from a small number of training examples and accurately reproduce the temporal evolution of unseen networks. Notably, the simulator is able to accurately predict emergent properties such as the Poisson's ratio and its dependence on strain, even though it was not explicitly trained for this task. In addition, it generalizes well across variations in system temperature, strain amplitude, and most significantly, Poisson's ratios beyond the training range. These findings suggest that using dynamical data to train machine learning models can support more data efficient and generalizable approaches for materials and molecular design, especially in data-scarce settings.
